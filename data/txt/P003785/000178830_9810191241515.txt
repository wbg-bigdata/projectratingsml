INDONESIA THIRD URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE URBAN SECTOR
A. Urban Development in Indonesia
Urban Structure and Growth
1.01      Indonesia's urban population in 1976 was estimated at 23.7 million,
approximately 18.2% of the country's total population of 130 million. Esti-
mates of the total population of Indonesia for the year 2000 range from 190
to 220 million. Of these, 70-80 million are expected to inhabit urban areas,
30-35 million in urban Java alone.
1.02      The official estimates of present and future levels of urbanization
and the rate of growth of the urban population of Indonesia (currently esti-
mated at 3.7% per annum) are moderate by international standards. However,
these summary statistics mask several important features of the urbanization
process in Indonesia. First, the annual growth of Indonesia's urban population
equals or surpasses the annual urban growth in most developing countries in
absolute numbers. Approximately 800,000 people are added to Indonesia's urban
population annually. Annual growth in Jakarta and Surabaya alone totals
350,000. The task of coping with growth of this absolute magnitude is a
serious challenge to Indonesian cities, however low the urbanization rate may
be in comparative terms. Second, while the overall urban growth rate may be
moderate, a disproportionate amount of the burden of population growth falls on
Jakarta and Surabaya, Indonesia's two largest cities. Currently growing at a
rate of about 4.5% per annum, Jakarta and Surabaya accounted for 63% of the
total 1961-71 population growth in the 30 Indonesian cities of over 100,000 in
size; Jakarta alone accounted for 47% of this growth. Increases in urban
population due to in-migration are particularly concentrated in Jakarta.
Between 1961 and 1971, Jakarta accounted for 0.94 million of the total urban
migration of 1.13 million. Third, the definition of urban residence used to
compile the conventional summary statistics does not accommodate the phenome-
non of circular migration---that is, the increasingly common practice among
rural villagers of moving into the city at non-peak times in the agricultural
calendar and back to the village again at planting and harvest times. Circular
migrants are often not classified as residents of the city, although they may
spend much of the year there making demands on the urban service
system and contribute to the urban economy. l/ Indeed, as the 1976 Intercensal
Survey on which current urban population estimates are based was taken at
the peak agricultural season, it is likely that the effective urban population
was significantly underestimated.
1/   Estimates of the number of circular migrants in Surabaya alone reach
400,000, relative to a total permanent population of 2.1 million.



-2-
1.03      An additional factor in interpreting urbanization statistics for
Indonesia is the fact that these statistics, limited at best, may not be
accurate in and of themselves. The definition of urban areas used in the 1976
survey excluded residents of peripheral bands around several cities, and some
of the expanding inter-city corridors, who in fact form part of the socio-
economic system of the city even if they technically reside outside the city
limits. In addition, current estimates of the level of urbanization in
Indonesia at the turn of the century are based on the assumption that the
difference in rural and urban growth rates will remain basically unchanged,
which implies stability in the rural-urban migration rate. Many observers
expect, on the contrary, that intense population pressure on rural land---
especially in Java---will result in a much higher rural-urban migration rate
in the next 25 years. If, as some predict, the "carrying capacity" of the
land in rural Java nears   its limit, there could be a surge in rural-urban
migration on the island leading to a much higher rate of urban growth than
that which currently prevails. Indeed, it is argued that given the existing
population pressure and technology and resource constraints in rural areas, it
is unlikely that rural per-capita income can be substantially raised unless
urban areas are intentionally stimulated in order to provide an outlet for a
rising portion of the expected population increase. The rapid densification
of rural Java and the link between city and countryside, forged by the in-
creasing pattern of circular migration, dictate a very important role for
Indonesia's cities in the years to come.
Urban Income and Employment
1.04      The most recent data on income and income distribution in urban
(and rural) Indonesia can be derived from the 1976 survey of consumption
expenditures conducted by the Survey Sosial Ekonomi Nasional (SUSENAS). The
SUSENAS data indicated a mean per-capita monthly consumption expenditure in
urban Indonesia of Rp 6,945 (US$11.10) 1/ including the value of goods received
free, home produced or received through barter. Using the same survey data,
it is estimated that about 65% of the inhabitants of urban areas have a
consumption expenditure level below the urban poverty threshold of $194 per
capita per annum (1976 prices) established by the Bank's Urban Poverty Task
Force.
1.05      Employment in Indonesia's cities is concentrated in 6 sectors;
public and domestic services (33.1%), trade (26.1%), agriculture (12.7%),
manufacturing (9.5%), transport and communications (7.9%) and construction
(6.4%). While total employment has increased at a faster rate than urban
population in the 1970s, simultaneous increases in the working-age population
and the labor force participation rate have resulted in an increase in the
urban unemployment rate from 4.8% in 1971 to 5.6% in 1976. The unemployment
situation is considerably more serious in urban than rural areas; the urban
unemployment rate is four times the rural unemployment rate, and the
1/   In comparing figures given in this report with those in the
previous reports, it should be noted that with the devaluation
of the Indonesian Rupiah by 50% in November 1978, all figures
expressed in US$ have been revised downwards using the new
exchange rate.



- 3 -
unemployed in urban areas look for 9 months on average before finding work
while their rural counterparts spend an average of 6 months looking for
work. Moreover, while growth rates may be declining,, the pressure on the
urban job market is likely to increase due to an increase in the share of
the population above age ten.  The reverse is likely to be the case  in rural
areas.
Urban Service Standards
1.06      Indonesia's urban areas are characterized by severe deficiencies in
essential infrastructure. The magnitude of the problem is revealed by the
following statistics:
(a) Less than one third of the urban population of Indonesia
has access to a safe, reliable public water system. As a
result, roughly half of the urban population obtain water
from private (often polluted) wells, springs or rainwater
collection, while others use the heavily polluted rivers
and water courses or purchase water from vendors at
relatively high prices;
(b) At present, only four cities have sewerage systems; in
each case, the system covers only part of the city and is
of limited effectiveness due to age and inadequate capacity;
(c) One quarter of the 1971 urban population had no facility
for human waste disposal and resorted to the use of
surface drains, ditches, canals or rivers. Only 17% are
served by safe, sanitary latrines; and
(d) Approximately 40% of the urban housing supply consists of
non-permanent structures. Current estimates indicate that
70,000 new urban housing units must be constructed annually
in order to meet the housing shortage by the year 2000.
1.07      Observers generally agree that the situation has deteriorated
rather than improved over the course of the 1970s, as urban infrastructure
expansion has not kept pace with urban population growth. As a result,
the public health situation is particularly bad. Water and filth-borne
diseases (e.g. cholera, typhoid, dysentery) constitute the principal causes
of morbidity and mortality in the country, which leads the world in incidence
of and deaths from cholera. The situation is particulary severe in the
"kampung" areas---that is, in the clustered, densely populated urban neighbor-
hoods that house a large proportion of Indonesia's urban population. Many of
these areas rely on open-drainage channels to carry off rain water, septic
tank effluent and household waste. These channels deteriorate to open sewers
and rubbish dumps, which become blocked in the dry season and flood the
kampungs in the rainy season. Infant mortality, already a high 126 per
thousand on average in Indonesia, reaches the alarming level of nearly 200
per thousand in the worst of the kampungs.



-4-
Priorities for Urban Policy
1.08      The challenges facing Indonesia's urban policy planners are many
and complex. Of them, perhaps the most critical are:
(a) to provide minimum basic infrastructure in the country's
many unserviced or underserviced urban areas;
(b) to create productive employment opportunities in urban areas
in order to combat existing unemployment and underemployment
and to provide jobs for new rural-urban migrants;
(c) to stimulate growth in cities other than Jakarta and Surabaya
in order to dilute the existing concentration of resources in
these two primary cities; to provide off-farm employment
opportunities outside Jakarta and Surabaya for potential
rural-urban migrants; and to build effective urban service
centers for Indonesia's rural population; and
(d) to develop the administrative and financial planning capabili-
ties of the country's municipal authorities and to develop
the fiscal base of the cities to enable them to provide the
essential services.
Indonesia's economic planners have recognized the importance of these tasks
and have begun to address them through local and national policies. The
development of an effective, well-serviced urban hierarchy, however, is a
challenge that will occupy Indonesia's planners for many years to come.
B.  The Project Cities
Jakarta
1.09      Jakarta, situated on the northwest coast of Java, is the capital
and largest city of Indonesia as well as the commercial and administrative
hub of the country. With a population of over 6 million, Jakarta is growing
at an estimated 4.5% annually, over half that growth due to net in-migration
from other parts of Indonesia.
1.10      In 1974, when the Bank's assistance to Jakarta's Kampung Improve-
ment Program (KIP) began, only 10% of Jakarta's population had access to a
piped water supply; approximately 50% relied on often-contaminated ground-
water wells, and 40% of Jakarta households bought water from the city's
relatively high-priced water vendors. Then, as now, Jakarta had no central
waterborne sewerage system; it had a seriously deficient solid-wastes
management system. Before the inception of KIP, much of the population of
Jakarta had no alternative other than to use drainage canals, ditches, rivers



and other open waterways for bathing, laundering, and defecation. Even houses
which had piped water frequently flushed wastes into open ditches along the
roadway.  The KIP Program, initlated under Repelita I (1969-74), has had a
marked effect on environmental conditions in Jakarta. By the end of 1979 (the
end of Repelita II), the city will have upgraded the physical infrastructure
in kampung residential areas covering 7,380 ha or approximately 90% of the
total residential area in Jakarta's kampungs, benefitting some 3.5 million
persons. Improved kampungs have been provided with paved roads and footpaths,
secondary drains, public watertaps, public sanitary facilities and private pit
privies, garbage collection service, and primary schools and health centers.
On completion of the kampung improvement effort scheduled for Repelita III, as
well as the scheduled expansion of water and sanitation services in kampung
areas improved under Repelita I, Jakarta will have succeeded in eliminating
the backlog of unserviced areas in the city, having provided minimum basic
services to residential areas covering 8,100 ha, roughly all of the existing
low-income kampung residential areas in the city. This accomplished, the KIP
unit will be able to turn its attention to servicing areas of new growth
within the Jakarta metropolitan area, and to maintaining areas already
improved.
1.11      Planners must turn their attention to existing and expected defi-
ciencies in the city's solid wastes and wastewater management, flood contro0l,
water supply, and transport system. Action in some of these has already begun.
Water supply, waste-water treatment and drainage projects are currently being
prepared for submission to bilateral and multilateral aid agencies.
Surabaya
1.12      Surabaya, the capital of East Java Province, is the second
largest city in Indonesia and a major port serving Java, Madura and South
Kalimantan. Although its current population of approximately 2.1 million
is less than half that of Jakarta, Surabaya's growth rate equals Jakarta's
at 4.5% per annum. Having lost its former commercial pre-eminence to Jakarta
in the years following independence, Surabaya has, over the last decade,
shown signs of recovering its commercial-industrial importance. In 1970,
East Java accounted for 32% of the employment in manufacturing in Indonesia,
and the lion's share of that employment was located in Surabaya. Roughly
10% of the city's work force is employed in industry, with an additional
30% engaged in commerce. Surabaya's expanding industrial and commercial
base is expected to continue to grow due to stimulation from domestic and
foreign investments and the availability of port facilities (currently being
upgraded) and an adequate labor supply. In light of its likely continued
importance to East Java, the national government has designated Surabaya
the "regional metropolis" for Central Indonesia, one of four developmert
areas identified in the regional development plan.
1.13      The economic growth that has taken place in Surabaya in recent
years has been accompanied by rapid population growth, which has placed
excessive demands on the existing physical and social infrastructure of
the city. It is estimated that 53% of the dwelling units are of temporary



- 6 -
construction, while another 23% are "semi-permanent" structures. Moreover,
50,000-100,000 of Surabaya's residents are "street people" with no homes,
temporary or permanent. Only 17% have access to piped water, while 27% buy
water from vendors and the remainder rely on private wells, open water courses
or rainwater collection. The solid wastes collection system accommodates only
an estimated 40% of daily wastes production. Roughly 60% of Surabaya's
inhabitants lack sanitary facilities for human-waste disposal and must make
use of canals, ditches and rivers for disposals of personal wastes. Finally,
while each district has a health center, these centers serve much larger
populations (up to 200,000) than indicated by the national standard of 1
center for every 30,000-50,000 persons.
1.14       In 1973, the municipal government of Surabaya initiated the W.R.
Supratman Program, which carried out limited physical infrastructure improve-
ments in kampungs whose inhabitants could participate in the financing
and execution of the improvement projects.  In 1976/77, within the framework
of a Bank-assisted urban development project (Loan 1336-IND), Surabaya estab-
lished an expanded KIP to upgrade deficient urban infrastructure in poor,
densely populated kampung areas. On completion of the project (1979), it is
estimated that 375 ha of residential kampung areas, housing 9.5% of the city's
population, will have been provided with improved infrastructure and minimum
basic amenities.
Ujung Pandang
1.15       Ujung Pandang, located on the southwest coast of Sulawesi, has been
a center for commerce and sea trade for centuries. Formerly called Makassar,
Ujung Pandang is the capital of the South Sulawesi Province, as well as the
urban center identified in Indonesia's regional development plan and the
regional metropolis for Eastern Indonesia, a development area which encompasses
eight eastern provinces. The current population of Ujung Pandang, the largest
city east of Java, is estimated to be 640,000, growing at a rate of nearly 2%
per annum.
1.16       In the late 1950s, Ujung Pandang experienced rapid population growth,
as political turmoil in the region generated a flow of migrants from rural
areas to the city. During this period, the city expanded without guidance
and at serious cost in terms of pressure on the existing, already inadequate
social and physical infrastructure. Despite efforts taken by the city gov-
ernment since that time to augment the city's infrastructure, service systems
remain inadequate. Roughly 30% of the population receive water via piped
house connections, while the remaining 70% rely on public taps, wells and
rainwater collection. Household wells, subject to saline intrusion and
contamination by leachate from latrines, are the typical water source for
kampung dwellers. Heavy rainfall in the monsoon months causes frequent
flooding, with flood waters remaining for several days in the worst areas.
Solid-wastes collection facilities in the city accommodate only about 55% of
the total wastes generated; the remainder, after scavenging or salvaging
for re-use, tends to be deposited in roadways, ditches, drains, and vacant
lots.



1.17      The environmental conditions in the kampungs of Ujung Pandang
are as bad as those in some of the worst kampungs of Jakarta and Surabaya.
The municipal government's initial response to the problems of high-density
kampungs has been a de-densification of the kampungs by relocating families to
new settlement areas. To date some 5,000 families have been relocated.
However, this program has entailed a high financial and social cost and the
municipal government has now agreed that upgrading in-situ is to be the only
viable solution for the foreseeable future.
Semarang
1.18      Semarang, the fourth largest city of Indonesia is located on the
north coast of Java midway between Jakarta and Surabaya. The capital of
Central Java, it was designated in Repelita II as the growth center for the
"subdevelopment region" that includes Central Java and Jogjakarta. Its
population of nearly 760,000 is growing at an annual rate of approximately
2.6%. While it is experiencing growing competition from other coastal cities,
Semarang remains an important seaport. All of its major industries, trade
centers and government offices are located on the coastal plain surrounding
the port area. While shipping and related activities provide employment for a
significant portion of Semarang's residents, almost two thirds of the work
force is concentrated in three sectors: manufacturing (17%), commerce (27%)
and government (20%). Median monthly household income is estimated at Rp
24,000 (20% below the national urban average).
1.19      In the areas of road and public transport, power, communications
and higher education, Semarang's service systems appear to satisfy at least
short-run, effective demand, most of which comes from higher-income households
or commmercial-industrial establishments. The immediate problem areas are
water supply, drainage, sewerage and solid wastes collection. Piped water is
supplied to about 25% of the city's households. Flooding is a major problem
in most of the low coastal area, both because of the topography and because of
clogging of the drainage system with silt and refuse. While some solid-wastes
collection services are available, it has been estimated that only about 36%
of the daily load is collected, the remainder largely dumped along the streets
or in drainage canals. These canals and other open waterways are also the
depository for much of the human waste generated in the city, as Semarang has
no formal sewerage system; and septic tanks are largely restricted to commercial
and industrial establishments and middle to high-income residential areas.
Surakarta
1.20      Surakarta, the only inland city of the five project cities, is
located in Central Java, roughly midway between the north and south coasts.
It has a population of approximately 450,000, growing at a rate of 1.6% per
annum. Founded in 1743, Surakarta was the royal capital of the Muslim Mataram
empire and retains today a great cultural and historical importance to the
Indonesians. It was designated under Repelita II as one of four "development
centers" in Central Java and hopes to expand its role as an administrative,
economic and cultural/tourism hub for the province.



1.21      Two thirds of the members of Surakarta's work force find employment
in one of three sectors--commerce (26%), manufacturing (24%) or government
(17%)--while roughly 14% are unemployed. Over the past decade, Surakarta
experienced a general decline in economic activity and a resultant outflow
of population to other urban centers. Surakarta also has a lower house-
hold income than the other major cities in Indonesia.
1.22      Recognizing severe service deficiencies in the city, Kotamadya
Surakarta has begun remedial programs in two critical sectors--water supply
and drainage. Surakarta's piped water-distribution system, unchanged since
1929, currently serves only 11% of the population through piped house connec-
tions. Under an emergency program assisted by USAID, a pipeline is being laid
to a new water source, and additions to the distribution system are underway.
The new water supply should be adequate to meet short-term requirements. In
order to ease the city's flooding problems, the national government is cur-
rently constructing a major stormwater drain in Kotamadya Surakarta. The city
government, on its part, has recently completed a new pump station on one of
the major drainage canals and plans to rehabilitate that canal (Kali Pepe) by
clearing it of silt and accumulated solid waste. While these projects will do
much to relieve the city's macro-drainage problem, low-lying kampung areas
will remain flood-prone until an adequate micro-level system of primary
and secondary drains is constructed and linked to the city's canal network.
C. Experience under Previous Bank Projects
1.23      The Jakarta Urban Development Project (Loan 1040-IND), approved
in 1974, was the first slum upgrading project financed by the Bank. It
included the provision of minimum basic services to about 2,000 ha of densely
populated kampungs in Jakarta benefitting a population of about 900,000.
In addition, it included the development of sites and services for about
7,200 low-income families in Jakarta. The Second Urban Development Project
(Loan 1336-IND) was approved in 1976 to cover a 3-year extension of KIP
in Jakarta to cover an additional 3,000 ha of unserviced kampungs benefitting
an additional 1.2 million population and to extend the program to Surabaya to
upgrade about 375 ha benefitting some 200,000 persons. These services have
been provided at a per capita cost (December 1978) of $69 in Jakarta and about
$35 in Surabaya. The second project also included pilot programs in Jakarta
and Surabaya for training of volunteer community health workers, who would be
based in the kampungs to provide simple curative and preventive health care.
1.24      Execution of KIP under both projects, has been fully satisfactory.
All infrastructure works under the first project have been completed within
the original estimate. Works under the second project in both Jakarta and
Surabaya are proceeding on schedule with the first 2 years of the program
(or about 65% of the total project) substantially completed by July 1978.
The only delays have been in completing the requisite number of community
facilities because of difficulties with land acquisition. Most of the kam-
pungs are very densely populated with only limited open space available. Land
acquisition under the circumstances is likely to continue to be difficult.
The municipal governments are attempting to overcome these problems by promot-
ing greater community participation at an early stage of the project planning
each year.



- 9 -
1.25      The success of KIP to date has had a major impact on Government
policy.  The approach to kampung improvement---low per-capita costs by using
only the minimum necessary standards, the programmatic approach to provide
services to all unserviced areas and reliance on local governments for
execution and financing---has been adopted as official policy by the Govern-
ment. The Government proposes an expansion of the program to other cities in
the next five-year development plan.
1.26      The sites and services component of the first project is about 2
years behind schedule primarily because of land acquisition problems. These
problems have now been resolved and construction is underway.  The first 4,000
of the total 7,200 families have been settled on the site. A principal objec-
tive of the sites and services component, which addresses shelter needs for
the growth in population, was that it could be rapdily expanded to a comple-
mentary program to KIP, which addresses the existing deficiencies of servited
urban land and shelter for low-income families. This objective, however, has
not been fully realized so far for two reasons. First, the concept of sites
and sercices --- provision of serviced plots with low infrastructure standar.G
and minimum housing relying on self-help for housing construction --- is new in
Idonesia and represents a major departure from the conventional housing pro-
grams. It has taken time for the various parts of the Government and the
public to fully understand and accept this concept for public housing. Sec onn,
land acquisition is a difficult and time consuming process in Indonesia because
of the weakness of the legislation governing the Government's powers of land
acquisition. This has severely restricted the Government's ability to acquire
well located urban land at a reasonable price which is essential for sites and
services and low-income housing projects. The Government recognizes this
constraint and has under consideration various steps to strengthen the legis-
lation.  In addition, it is examining other approaches to urban land develop-
ment such as land consolidation and in-fill development of plots in low-
density peripheral kampungs. The Bank is providing technical assistance i-f,
support of these efforts. It is hoped that the resolution of these probti.Es
over the next one or two years will enable the Government and the Bank to
support expanded programs for shelter.
II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. The Project
Objectives
2.01      The proposed project would continue the Government's initiatl 
kampung improvement and have two principal objectives.  First, it is des; -?'
to provide further support to the Government's efforts to provide essential
services to low-income neighborhoods (kampungs) in Jakarta and Surabaya e,I!
to extend the program to three additional secondary cities (Ujung Pandang,
Semarang and Surakarta). The extension of KIP to secondary cities is in



- 10 -
keeping with Government policy to develop a national program for kampung
improvement during the next five-year development plan (Repelita III) and
would initiate the process of development of secondary cities in Indonesia.
Strengthening of local governments' capabilities to sustain the program
over the long term would be an important aspect of the project. Second, the
scope of the project would be expanded to include investments aimed at im-
proving general public health. The project would address critical short to
medium-term problems of solid wastes management (in Jakarta and Surabaya) and
drainage (in Surabaya), both of which will have an important bearing on public
health. The project would also include support for community health services,
based on the pilot programs initiated under the second project. In these
areas, development of appropriate institutions to deliver these services at a
low cost will be particularly emphasized.
Project Components
2.02      The project would include the following components:
(a)  Kampung Improvement Program.  Provision of minimum basic infra-
structure services including roads, footpaths, drainage, water
supply, sanitation, solid wastes collection, schools and health
facilities in low-income unserviced kampung areas, covering a
total area of about 750 ha benefitting about 210,000 persons
in Jakarta and 4 secondary cities including Surabaya (580
ha; 275,000 persons), Ujung Pandang (375 ha; 137,000 persons),
Semarang (310 ha; 95,000 persons) and Surakarta (170 ha; 49,000
persons). In Jakarta, water and sanitation services will be
provided to an additional 2,400 ha of high-density kampungs
(1.4 million population) upgraded by the city government
during Repelita I.
(b)  Solid Wastes Management.  Initiation of a program for drain
cleaning and door-to-door collection of solid wastes in
Jakarta and Surabaya, particularly in the low-income
kampungs. Population served by the end of the project
period would be about 1.5 million in Jakarta and 500,000
in Surabaya. Project includes the construction of depots
and ward offices and the provision of equipment for waste
collection, transport and disposal.
(c)  Drainage Improvement.  Dredging and desilting of about 9 km
of main drainage canals and rehabilitation of 4 existing
pumping stations in Surabaya. The project includes resettle-
ment to alternative sites of about 500 families displaced by
the program.
(d)  Community Health Services.  Training, equipment and materials
for about 500 community health workers in Jakarta and 275
community health workers in Surabaya to provide simple health
care services and education in public health in the improved
kampungs.



- 11 -
(e)  Small-Business Development.  A pilot program for the develop-
ment of small-scale entrepreneurs located in the kampungs by
the provision of: (i) extension services, including advice in
production, management, accounting and marketing; and (ii)
small credits ranging from Rp 50,000-500,000 ($125-l,250) with
low collateral requirements, utilizing flexible procedures for
processing and collection.
(f)  Land Registration.  The project provides assistance to the
Directorate General of Agraria of Dalam Negeri to carry out
a 5-year program of surveying and registration of land rights
throughout the city of Surabaya.
(g)  Technical Assistance.  Assistance in (i) project planning,
design and implementation; (ii) solid wastes management;
(iii) training of staff in property valuation and imple-
mentaton of a valuation system in Jakarta and Surabaya;
(iv) implementation of a planning, programming and budget-
ing system for the city of Surabaya; (v) project monitoring
and evaluation; (vi) management assistance to Cipta Karya;
and (vii) preparation of future urban development projects.
B. Cost Estimates
2.03      The project cost (exclusive of direct taxes) is estimated at
Rp 60,000 million (US$96 million) with a foreign exchange component of
Rp 20,400 million (US$32.7 million) or about 34% of the total cost. A summary
of the project cost is presented in Table II-1, with detailed estimates given
in Annex 1. Cost estimates for Jakarta and Surabaya KIP are based on typical
unit-price levels established for similar works under the Second Urban Project.
Cost estimates for solid wastes component are based on preliminary feasibility
studies. Drainage improvement costs for Surabaya are based on consultants'
feasibility studies and updated by the drainage division of the City Govern-
ment. Cost estimates for Ujung Pandang, Semarang and Surakarta are based on
consultants' feasibility studies and preliminary engineering designs. Average
man-month costs (all inclusive) for consultants and advisory services are
estimated at $8,000 for foreign services and $1,600 for locally obtained
services. The base cost estimates are in December 1978 prices. Price escala-
tion factors assumed on the basis of recent trends are: for civil works and
locally manufactured equipment 23% in 1979, 16% in 1980, 13% each in 1981 and
1982 and 9% thereafter; and for foreign equipment at 7% per annum throughout
the project period. No physical contingencies are included for kampung
improvement infrastructure works since the design of these works is governed
by an overall per-ha budget limitation. Solid wastes improvement works and
drainage works, however, include a 10% physical contingency factor, which is
considered adequate in view of the relatively simple nature of the works.

C. Detailed Project Description
Kampung Improvement Program
2.04      The Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) for each of the five cities
has been designed along the lines of the ongoing Bank-supported projects in
Jakarta and Surabaya. It would provide basic services aimed at improving
the health and environmental conditions of low-income kampungs. These ser-
vices include footpaths, secondary roads, surface drainage, water supply
from public standpipes, individual and communal toilets and washing facili-
ties, solid waste collection facilities, elementary schools and community
health centers.
2.05      Although hard and fast standards for KIP are not possible or
desirable, given the considerable variation in existing conditions, levels
of service and varying population densities, some guidance and control is
necessary to maintain a reasonable balance of services within budget con-
straints. The functional standards adopted for the Second Urban Project have
been maintained but modified in view of the experience. In addition to a
minimum standard, a target and a maximum standard have been introduced for
roads. The standards for water supply have been increased slightly to improve
the coverage. The proposed functional standards have been defined as follows:
(a)  Roads.  All dwelling within a maximum distance of 100 m
from a one-way road and 300 m from a two-way road. Length
per ha may range between 50-100 m/ha for one-way roads
and 15-35 m/ha for two-way roads; the target standard for
the two types would be 60 m/ha and 20 m/ha respectively.
Pavement widths will be 4 m or 6 m on a right-of-way of 6,
8 or 10 m, depending on traffic conditions.
(b)  Footpaths.  Paved footpaths to within 20 m of every dwelling
not located on a road. The footpaths will have variable
pavement widths depending on site conditions but ranging
from 1.5-3 m with 3-6 m right of way. In addition, narrow
footpaths of 1 m width will be provided where feasible to
link groups of houses in the interior of kampungs with the
main footpath system.
(c)  Drainage.  Open secondary drains along road and footpaths.
Primary drains as required.
(d)  Water Supply.  Connection to city main supply or deep wells
as appropriate. Design standards for the reticulation
system will be about 60 lpcd. One standpipe will be pro-
vided to serve each RT (about 20 to 50 families). Where
sufficient supplies are available, private connections will
be available along the reticulation system.



- 14 -
(e) Sanitation. Pit privies for individual families and house-
hold groups will be provided wherever the appropriate soil
conditions exist. In other areas community toilet and
washing facilities (MMCK) will be provided at a rate of
1 toilet seat per 12 families.
(f) Solid Wastes Disposal. Hand carts and bins will be provided
in all cities, and motor vehicles and trailers in Jakarta
and Surabaya.
(g) Primary Schools. Primary schools (with furniture) to make
up the deficiency of facilities in the kampungs and will
provide enough space for about 75% of school-age children.
In Jakarta, the schools will be financed from the INPRES
program.
(h) Health Clinics. In the secondary cities small health
clinics (sub-pyskesmas) with 3 to 6 rooms and a total area
of up to 300 m , with necessary furniture and equipment.
The functional standards defined above represent the desirable level of
service. An overall per ha budget limitation in each city (see para 2.08
below) is maintained which, along with the existing service levels, deter-
mines the achievable level of service in a particular kampung. Details of
the design procedure have been agreed with each municipal government and are
set out in detail in the project file. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the design standards will not be changed without prior
approval of the Bank.
2.06      The community facilities to be provided in the project cities,
taking into account the availability of existing facilities, are estimated as
follows:
Primary Schools        Sub-Puskesmas
No.  Classrooms         No.   Rooms
Jakarta              By INPRES                  none
Surabaya             15        90             10      60
Ujung Pandang         6        36             10       60
Semarang              4        24              8      48
Surakarta             2        12              4      24
2.07      The areas to be upgraded, number of beneficiaries and per-capita and
per-ha costs (December 1978 prices) of the program in the project cities are
estimated to be as follows:



- 15 -
No. of    % of Total  Population  Per-Capita  Per-Hectare
Area (ha)  Kampungs  Kampung_Area  Upgraded   Cost (US$)   Cost (US$)
Jakarta            750      30             8       210,000         69          19,400
Surabaya           580      27           20        275,000         35          16,675
Ujung Pandang      375       13          34        137,000         39          14,200
Semarang           310      15           15         95,000         44          14,200
Surakarta          170      10           16         49,000         35          10,150
2.08      In Jakarta, the project would also provide water supply and sanita-
tion to about 2,400 ha of high-density kampungs which were upgraded during
Repelita I (1969-74) to bring their level of improvement to standards adopted
for KIP in Repelita II. The upgrading of these kampungs included primarily
access roads and drainage. Per-capita cost of this incremental improvement
is about $7.50 (December 1978 prices).
Solid Wastes Management - Jakarta and Surabaya
2.09      The proposed solid wastes management program for Jakarta and Surabaya
is aimed at improving waste collection, street/drain cleaning, transport and
disposal of the wastes, and unifying control of all solid wastes related
operations under a central agency (cleansing department) in the above cities.
The absence of adequate physical and planning facilities, coupled with the
fragmention of management responsibilities among several agencies involved,
has been a deterrant in the formulation of a city-wide comprehensive solid
wastes management program in these cities. Currently, only about 40-50% of
the wastes generated---approximately 3,600 tons/day in Jakarta and 1,000
tons/day in Surabaya---is collected with the remainder being disposed of by
partial burning or dumping at random locations in canals or drains and along
roads, with the consequent health and pollution hazards as well as drainage
problems.
2.10      The project will provide the required infrastructure, transport and
disposal facilities for the first phase of a long-term program recommended for
these cities. A pilot program covering about 2 or 3 kampungs will be initiated
to study improved methods of waste collection, storage and transfer, route
planning, transport facilities and sanitary disposal methods suited to local
conditions. The emphasis of the program will be to collect wastes on a
door-to-door basis and to clean streets and drains, especially in low-income
areas that have the most serious solid wastes problems. Containerized storage
will be sought from the outset. Infrastructure provisions will include
depots, offices and workshops and related transfer facilities. The results of
the pilot study will be extended to the actual service areas over the 3 year
project period. Service will be initiated on a pilot scale in one or two
kelurahans (15,000 population) each in Jakarta and Surabaya and expanded to 50
kelurahans (1.5 million population) in Jakarta and 19 kelurahans (500,000
population) in Surabaya by the end of the project period.

2.11      The pivotal element of the proposed program consists of decentral-
ized control of physical operations at the existing 3 levels of political
structure. The basic operating unit will be at the kelurahan (ward) level.
Each kelurahan will have a depot consisting of an office, toilet and a transfer
facilitity (trailor and cart parking). Control of transportation time tables
and supervision of kelurahan depots will be under the responsibility of keca-
matan (district) offices. Garage and servicing facilities will be provided at
the Wilayah (region) level. It is estimated that the project would include
the following infrastructural provisions: 108 kelurahan depots, 16 kelurahan
offices and three garages for Jakarta; and 27 kelurahan depots and 1 garage
for Surabaya. In both cities, the program would include a phased replacement
of existing vehicles as well as provide for additional vehicles required.
About 93 vehicles will be provided in Jakarta and 60 tractors with 180 trailers
in Surabaya. Handcarts for house collection and street-sweeping will be
provided in required quantities.
2.12      Finally, the project would establish sanitary landfill as an impor-
tant means of solid wastes disposal in both Jakarta and Surabaya. The present
system of open dumping in both cities does not follow any code of practice and
provides a breeding grounds for flies and rodents and causes pollution of
streams and rivers. Training of staff in strict practice of sanitary landfill
is included in the project on a pilot scale.
Drainage Improvements: Surabaya
2.13      The project includes the immediate drainage improvement works
identified in the drainage master plan for Surabaya prepared by consultants
(Camp, Dresser and McKeee, USA) in 1976. The master plan, which calls for
an overall investment for about US$50 million (1976 prices), indicated an
immediate need to remove an estimated 260,000 m3 of silt from the principal
waterways of Surabaya's drainage system accumulated because of poor main-
tenance in the past. Some rehabilitation works are currently being carried
out for Kali Surabaya, a major river in the city. The present project would
provide support to the rehabilitation works of two major canals in the city.
It includes: (a) dredging and providing embankment construction for about 3.7
km length of Greges Canal, and about 5.1 km length of Kalidami Canal; and
(b) rehabilitating pumping stations at four locations: Kupand, Darmo, Gunung-
sari and Bratang. It has been estimated that the above project would provide
relief from immediate drainage problems for about 1,000 ha of densely populated
urban area. The proposed dredging program will involve relocation of the
families whose dwellings encroach on the canal banks. It is estimated
that a total of 2,000 families will be affected, of which 500 families
may have to be displaced due to the dredging along the Greges Canal and 100
to 200 families along the Kalidami Canal. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that KMS will make satisfactory compensation and relocation
arrangements in consultation with the Bank and earmark the necessary funds
in the municipal budget.

Community Health Workers
2.14      The Community Health Worker (CHW) program, developed on a pilot
scale in Jakarta and Surabaya in the Second Urban Project and to be extended
in the proposed project, is intended to provide community-based health services
focussing on environmental hygiene, maternal and child health services, minor
curative and first aid treatment, health counselling and health and family
planning and health referral services. This program will complement the
formal system of public health care which, because of shortages of trained
personnel, inaccessibility and a lack of adequate facilities and the socio-
economic cultural barriers, does not reach down to the community level.
The multipurpose community health workers will provide the link between a
low-income family and the formal health services. The CHWs activities in
the family planning area will be closely coordinated with those of the
population workers, which are also under the Ministry of Health. The program
will be carried out in Jakarta and Surabaya, where the program of physical
improvements and the construction of health facilities is well underway.
About 500 CHWs in Jakarta and about 275 CRWs in Surabaya will be trained to
provide community health services in the kampungs to be improved under the
project. Each CHW will serve 100-200 families.
2.15      CHWs will be chosen from the community itself.  They will usuaily
have had nine years of schooling and will undergo about 100 hours (25 days) of
training. The training curriculum would cover Government policy on health;
the role of Puskesmas and Sub-Puskesmas; environmental sanitation and health,
maternal and child health care (including nutrition education), family welfare
and hygiene, first aid and treatment for minor ailments; family planning
methods, epidemiology of disease; and referral services and communication
skills.  Refresher courses will be given in individual subjects, after 6-12
months of practical experience, to reinforce what has been learned. The
training will be conducted by the existing municipal health staff. In nechi
city, a qualified doctor is incharge of the program on a full-time basis,
2.16      In Jakarta, the health workers operate from a health post (Pos
Kesehatan) constructed in each community (RW) of about 3,000 persons. It
is a simple two-room facility---one room for health activities in general
and the other for a young-child center (Karang Balita), which will focus
on nutrition, disease prevention and education of pre-school children.
Forty-two health posts will be constructed by DKI from its own budget witlt 1.2
CHWs assigned to each post.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that DKSi
will construct these health posts as required. Although the health posts will
serve as a base for the CHWs and for the community to visit, a good portion of
the CHWs time will be spent in visiting families in their homes. In Surabaya,
the health workers will operate from their homes.
2.17      The health workers will provide their services on a voluntozy Uaais
During the first year, they will be paid an honorarium of about Rp 3,500 per
month, a part of which will be in kind. The communities will be encouraged
to form "insurance" schemes to cover the cost of the health worker after the
first year.  On the basis of experience with the ongoing program, a payment of
Rp 50-100 per family per month (depending on the ability to pay) should be
sufficient to support the CHW.

Land Registration: Surabaya
2.18      The project provides assistance to the Directorate General of
Agraria in Dalam Negeri to carry out a 5-year program of registration of land
rights throughout the city. This program would serve as a model for similar
programs in other Indonesian cities. The Government is planning to begin such
programs in approximately 20 other cities in Repelita III. At present, rights
to land in urban areas in Indonesia are often uncertain due to the lack of an
efficient land registration system, although all important land rights must be
registered according to the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960. It is estimated that
only 10% of the land area in the City of Surabaya is registered, and that the
proportion is approximately the same for other cities (excluding Jakarta).
The lack of concrete title to land has not encouraged upgrading of housing in
the improved kampungs, and other low-income areas, and has sometimes led to
abuse regarding compensation paid for public taking of land. It has further
discouraged the establishment of a mortgage system using land rights as
security. Such a system is also necessary to carry out an effective land tax
system.
2.19      The program, as a whole, would take 5-years and would consist of
aerial photography of the entire city; surveying and mapping of particular
plots; training of new personnel and existing personnel, the cost of new
equipment; and the expenses of an initial land registration program. Using
the aerial photos of the city, an inventory of rights to land by kelurahan and
a program of surveying and mapping of particular plots would be carried out.
Approximately 2 kecamatans or 12 kelurahans (2,500 ha) would be completed each
year on the average. Following the process of surveying and mapping, there
would be a one-time effort of registration of all rights to land, buildings
and vegetation. Since the results of this work would also be useful in
implementing the improved property valuation system in Surabaya to be intro-
duced under the project (para. 5.14), assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that Dalam Negeri will make available all surveys, maps and records of
registration of rights to the Directorate General of Taxes in a timely fashion.
Technical Assistance and Training
2.20      The technical assistance and training component includes about 500
manmonths of foreign consultants and 450 manmonths of local consultants
services for the following items (terms of reference for all of them will be
agreed upon during negotiations):
(a)  Feasibility Studies to develop KIP and other urban development
projects in 4 to 6 other Indonesian cities following the recom-
mendations of Repelita III. The consultants will also provide
assistance in programming, design and project review to Cipta
Karya in their management of the national KIP.
(b)  Design and supervision assistance to project cities will be
provided over a 3-year period to assist KIP units in
preparing designs and tender documents; reviewing bidding
procedures; supervising construction; maintaining project



- 19 -
accounts and preparing reimbursement applications; monitoring
and evaluating the implementation of the program, training
local government staff; and assisting in yearly programming
and long-term planning for KIP. The design assistance will
include the instruction and use with KIP teams of aerial
photos as an information base for kampung identification,
analysis and site design.
(c) Training for KIP teams. The existing training unit which
Cipta Karya runs in Bandung will be strengthened to provide
courses for Cipta Karya and local government KIP staff in
project preparation, implementation and management.
(d) Monitoring and evaluation. Assistance to Cipta Karya and
the project cities will be provided over a 4-year period
to monitor, evaluate and feed back to Cipta Karya and the
KIP units the economic and social impacts of the program
as an input to improved project design and management.
A local project leader will manage the program with survey
assistance from local universities and intermittent foreign
specialist assistance.
(e) Solid wastes management. One advisor will be provided to Cipta
Karya to assist DKI and KMS in design and implementation of the
pilot program for solid wastes program and its evaluation and
extension to other areas of the city, supervising the sanitary
landfill projects and developing an appropriate organization
structure for the Cleansing Department in both cities. About
6 man-months of engineering assistance is also included to
assist in the design of the sanitary landfill sites.
(f) Drainage design and supervision. Engineering assistance over
a 3-year period will be provided for design, tendering and
supervision of the immediate works program for surface water
drainage.
(g) Management assistance. A resident management specialist will
be provided for 2 years to assist Cipta Karya in the overall
management of its operations including establishing an effective
information planning and monitoring system for projects; review-
ing program scope and development; and recommending the appro-
priate organization and staffing required.
(h) Municipal finance. One municipal finance and management
specialist will be provided to assist the City of Surabaya in
developing a system of planning, programming and budgeting
(PPBS) of resources available to the city and to provide
assistance in initial installation to ensure effective
operation of such a system from the fiscal year commencing
April 1, 1980. The specialist will recommend changes in
the existing system (accounting, administrative organization)
which would be necessary to obtain maximum benefit from the
PPBS to be adopted by the city.



- 20 -
(i)  Property valuation.  Consultant services will be provided
over a 3-year period to design, develop and implement a
regular system of property valuation in Surabaya. The
consultants will also be responsible for training Indonesian
personnel from the IPEDA office as instructors in property
valuatian, who would in turn, train other staff. The
activities of the consultants would be to: (i) setup and
design a valuation system; (ii) train Indonesian personnel;
and (iii) supervise the implementation of the valuation
program.
D. Financing Plan
2.21      Of the total estimated costs, about 56% would be financed from
the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan of US$54 million to cover the
full foreign exchange component of US$32.7 million and some 37% of local
currency costs. The balance, US$42 million (Rp 26.3 billion), would be
financed by the. Central Government and each of the local governments
concerned in accordance with the following financing plan:

2.22       Except for expenditures on technical assistance (for Cipta Karya)
and for training and consultancy services for small-business development
(for BIPIK), GOI will pass the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to each of
the local governments through subsidiary loan agreements. The subsidiary loan
would bear an interest of not less than 1/4% higher than the Bank loan to
cover BI's administrative charges and would be repayable over 20 years,
including a 5 year period of grace for principal. The exchange risk will be
borne by GOI. These terms are comparable to those used in the 2 previous Bank
loans for urban development. The Central Government funds, which constitute
about 15% of the project cost in the three smaller cities, will be passed on
as budgetary grants in 3 annual installments in 1979/80-1981/82. Agreement
was reached during negotiations on the financing schedule for the central
Government funds. The completion of the subsidiary loan agreements between
GOI and each of the local governments is a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. National Level
National Housing Authority
3.01      Broad guidelines pursuant to establishing national housing policy
originate with the National Housing Authority (NHA). This body, consisting
largely of Cabinet Ministers, is chaired by the Minister of Economic, Monetary
and Industrial Affairs, one of two Super-Ministers who share supervisory
responsibility for several ministries and report directly to the President.
The Executive Secretary of the Authority is the Director-General of Cipta
Karya, and the staff at Cipta Karya consitutes the Secretariat of the Authori-y,
Cipta Karya
3.02      Cipta Karya is the principal agency at the national level respon-
sible for developing housing and urban development programs responsive to
policy guidelines set by NRA. Within the Directorate-General of Cipta
Karya there are 5 divisions, each responsible for different aspects of housing
and its related services. The divisions are: Housing; Building; Planning;
Water and Sanitation; and Building Materials Research. Cipta Karya assists
provincial and municipal government agencies involved in public works infra--
structure, housing programs and regional planning by providing technical
advice. The Directorate of Housing (Direktorat Perumahan) is primarily
responsible for providing technical assistance regarding KIP to cities through
its Sub-Directorate of land and Housing Development. The Sub-Directorate has
produced a set of useful guidelines for local governments to use in prepairin,g
their KIP projects. The Directorate of Sanitation provides technical guidance
for the solid wastes and drainge programs.



- 22 -
Dalam Negeri
3.03      The Ministry of the Interior has a directorate general of General
Government and Regional Autonomy, which is responsible for the administration
and funding of the Central Government INPRES subsidy programs to the provinces
and the cities. It is further responsible for the approval of appointments,
staffing and salaries for provincial and local government officials. The
Directorate of Urban Development, which is a division of this directorate
general, has specific responsibility for the municipal governments' development
programs including the KIP Program. It must approve both the size and nature
of such programs after they have been approved by the City Council and the
Governor. In addition, Dalam Negeri must approve all borrowings by cities
that exceed 20% of their local revenues.
3.04      The Directorate of Urban Development has recently become more
active in setting urban policy. Starting in Repelita III, Planning Boards
will be established for each Kabupaten (division of Province) and Kotamadya
(city) and staff will be assigned or recruited to serve the Boards. The
focus of the Boards will be on the physical and spatial aspects of planning
and on the coordination and monitoring of investment required to implement
the plans. As part of this new activity, KIP is now receiving more attention
from Dalam Negeri, and the Ministry is providing guidance to the mayors and
local officials in the definition and implementation of KIP in their cities.
B. Provincial Level
3.05      All cities, except Jakarta which has provincial status, fall under
the authority of the province in which they are located, and city projects
which use provincial or INPRES funds require the approval of the Governor of
the province. Land acquisition and tenure rights on resale are also under
the control of the Governor. In addition, the province coordinates develop-
ment projects within its region. The Provincial Development Board (BAPPEDA)
examines the program as formulated by the city and evaluates it with regard to
other development programs both for that city and for the province as a whole.
In specific instances, it might provide technical and financial assistance in
the actual formulation of particular programs. In each of the project cities
and provinces, agreements on land acquisition and tenure rights and on the
financing of the project have been made between Dalam Negeri, the Governor and
the Mayor. Some provinces provide financial subsidies towards specific
development programs of their cities. Such financial contributions from the
provinces vary depending on the relative level of need between their rural and
urban populations.
C. Local Governments
3.06      City governments in Indonesia are essentially administrative divi-
sions of the Central Government, although city budgets and projects must
also be approved at the provincial level as well by Dalam Negeri at the



- 23 -
national level. The mayor, who is the executive head of the local govern-
ment, is appointed by the Central Government and reports to an elected City
Council which must approve his proposals. Taxing authority and levels
of taxation are set by the central government. Within these financial
constraints, the Mayor has considerable influence. He has a staff which
deals with all major public services (except electricity) and who report
to him. There are generally separate municipal departments which deal with
public works, sanitation, garbage disposal, health, social welfare, education,
finance, planning, general administration and law and order. An autonomous
municipal enterprise (PAM) is responsible for municipal water supplies.
There are also branch offices of the national line agencies in the city
which provide technical assistance to the Mayor's staff. In most of the
cities except Jakarta and Surabaya, the municipal governments lack qualified
technical staff for the various departments. Dalam Negeri is seeking to
strengthen the city administrations, and the introduction of KIP will support
this objective.
Kampung Improvement Program
3.07      The Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) will be the largest public
capital investment project in each city. The planning and implementation of
the program will be under a separate city KIP unit, whose manager will report
to the Mayor. The KIP unit will be guided by a Steering Committee chaired by
the Mayor. Its membership will include the heads of the: (i) Subdirectorate
of Planning; (ii) Subdirectorate of Development; (iii) Subdirectorate of
budget and finance; (iv) City Planning Department; (v) city physical and
social infrastructure agencies; and (vi) District Heads (Camat) where relevant.
The functions of the Steering Committee will be to review the KIP budget and
financing for the coming fiscal year; to agree on selection of kampungs for
improvement; to resolve problems of coordination with other municipal depart-
ments; to expedite land acquisition; to supply suitable staff for the KIP
unit; and to refer larger policy issues to the City Council, the Province and
the Central Government, as appropriate. This committee will have authority to
coordinate economic and social, as well as physical infrastructure programs
together with other development projects of the city. Chart 18954 illustrates
the organizational arrangements in Jakarta and Chart 18955 the arrangement in
Surabaya and those proposed for the other secondary cities.
3.08      The functions of the KIP units are to prepare and implement the
social, economic and physical components of KIP from pre-planning through
to supervision on a yearly cycle. The units in all cities will define kampung
areas for improvement, develop a budget and financial plan, and will prepare
drawings and specifications and manage the infrastructure contracts. They
will also arrange for necessary land acquisition and relocation of families,
as necessary, in close coordination with the office of Agraria, the land
acquisition committee and the social affairs department (PMD). The planning
and implementation of the program will be done in collaboration with the
communities affected and, for this purpose, a field office staffed by a
social worker will be established in each kampung slated for upgrading. The
office will inform the kampung committee (Camat, RWs, RTs), and other non-
governmental community associations about the program, provide a forum for



- 24 -
discussion and modification of the plans and provide liaison between the KIP
office and the kampung committee.  The field office will also be the base for
supervision of the physical work.
3.09      In Jakarta and Surabaya, the KIP unit is organized into three
divisions - planning, construction management; and finance and administration -
reporting to a project manager. Apart from occasional weak coordination
between planning and supervision, this arrangement has worked well and will
be continued in the new program and established in the new project cities.
A core of full-time staff in the KIP unit will manage most of these functions
supplemented by the line agency staff (Dinas) of each city. The core staff
requirements for the program in each city have been agreed with the minucipal
governments concerned and with Dalam Nigeri.
3.10      An important feature of all future KIP operations will be the
creation of a special unit for land registration and acquisition in KIP sites.
Timely land acquisition and adequate compensation have been problems for the
program in the past and now, with the addition of the registration of plots and
regularization of tenure in the project, the Government has agreed to establish
a special unit within the Land Office (Dt. Agraria) of each city with a full-
time staff. The unit will: (a) register all public land occupation and
tenures; (b) arrange for occupants of public land to purchase their plots;
(c) value the land and buildings; (d) develop a timely process for the acqui-
sition of land for public access and facilities; and (e) improve the methods
of compensation both in cash and in kind to expropriated owners and occupants.
3.11      In Jakarta the KIP unit is to be expanded to include a socio-economic
cell in the planning division. The DKI is interested to expand and strengthen
its out-reach to small businesses and to stimulate employment, and this cell
would work with the DKI agencies in coordinating their programs with KIP, and
in monitoring and evaluation of the programs. The revised structure and
functions of the KIP units are depicted in Chart 18953.
3.12      The KIP units will provide the necessary planning and implementation
capacity at the city level, which is essential for the success of KIP. At the
time of negotiations each project city had established a KIP unit and appointed
the project manager and most units had assigned planning staff. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that: (a) the KIP units in all cities will be
fully staffed by April 1, 1979; (b) that the Department of Agraria will
establish a land acquisition task force for KIP works; and (c) that Jakarta
will establish a socio-economic cell in its KIP unit not later than April 1,
1979.
Solid Wastes Management
3.13      At present, the responsibility for solid wastes management in both
Jakarta and Surabaya is split between the Cleansing Department and a number of
neighborhood organizations. The function of the Cleansing Department is
limited to the removal and disposal of the wastes from the local neighborhood
(kelurahan) dumps and the cleansing of main roads. Each kelurahan (20,000-
30,000 pouplation) is responsible for organizing household collection of the



- 25 -
wastes and bringing it to the central collection point. (There are 232 kelura-
hans in Jakarta and 60 kelurahan in Surabaya.)   In the higher-income kampungs,
the lurah (head of the kelurahan) Levies a monthly charge which is used to pay
for privately organized waste collection services. In the lower-income
neighborhoods, which constitute more than 70% of the population, the residents
are expected to bring their own wastes to the central collection point. Hoo-
ever, it is not uncommon for the private collection service or the residents
to deposit the wastes at the nearest convenient public place like a canal, a
drain or an open space. Also, poor coordination between the neighborhood
collection system and the Cleansing Department often results in the wastes not
being removed at the appropriate time and thus causing frequent overspilling
of storage facilities. This fragmentation of responsibility is the principal
cause for the worst of the solid waste management problems. Under the project,
the Cleansing Department in each city will be organized to gradually assume
responsibility for all services down to individual dwelling and for cleansing
of all roads, footpaths and open drains. This would be done initially on a
pilot scale and, over time, extended to the entire city through a phased
program.
3.14      Jakarta already has a separate Cleansing Department, which provides
for a decentralized control of operation at three levels based on the politi-
cal structure.  This structure forms a satisfactory basis for building the
proposed heirarchy of services with the kelurahan as the basic operating unit.
Surabaya, however, while using the same general structure for wastes collection
and disposal as Jakarta, at present gives very low status to the cleansing
services, which are controlled by a third-tier section in the Public Works
Department, itself one of 25 municipal departments.   The establishment of a
separate Cleansing Department in Surabaya is vital in order to give adequate
status to solid wastes management services and to attract management of
adequate quality. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Cleansing Department in Surabaya will be established no later than April 1.
1979.
3.15      In both cities, to carry out the detailed work related to the
project such as design, construction, route planning and evaluation of
systems, it is proposed to create a Solid Wastes Planning (SWIP) unit to
administer the program. This unit would be headed by a separate Deputy
Director and would include a civil engineer, a mechanical engineer, a wor'
study specialist and a financial analyst. A public relations officer wqould be
used for community relations and communications.  The SWIP units would be fien
of any operational responsibilities and concerned only with the planning and
supervision of the project. While each SWIP unit would be controlled by the
Director of Cleansing, it should also have policy links to Cipta Karya and the
KIP unit in each city.  The pilot projects would also require a project tearm
the leader of which would be reponsible to the SWIP unit. Both Jakarta c'.d
Surabaya have already established the SWIP units; confirmation of this w^
obtained during negotiations.
Community Health Worker Training
3.16      The municipal health departments of Jakarta and Surabaya will be
responsible for training and supervision of the community health workers5



- 26 -
A senior doctor has the overall responsibility for coordination with the
other municipal health activities. A full-time project director, a qualified
doctor, is responsible for project implementation. The city health department
works with the local community leaders to: (a) familiarize the community with
the concepts of the program; (b) recruitment of the health workers; and (c)
supervision of the activities of the health workers. The health workers
selected carry-out community-self surveys, in order to obtain data on health
conditions in the community and to train themselves in dealing with the
community. The problems identified by the surveys are given priority at the
particular health posts. An outside private organization has been retained by
each city to carry out an evaluation of the program.
Land Registration: Surabaya
3.17      The model land registration program proposed for Surabaya will be
carried out according to procedures already established in Regulation No. 10
of 1961. The basic unit will be the kelurahan, which is roughly congruent to
a kampung. The local lurah will play a major role in validating land title
claims although the process of identifying claims, surveying and mapping will
be carried out by the City Directorate of Agraria. Local law students and
notaries will assist in the initial registration process. The program will
be supervised by the Directorate of Agraria in Dalam Negeri.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Kampung Selection
4.01      Each local government is responsible for the preparation and
implementation of KIP with guidance from Cipta Karya and Dalam Negeri.
Each city has defined a 5-year KIP for Repelita III (1979-84) of which the
Bank will assist in financing the first three years. In all cities, kampungs
have been chosen for improvement based on a combination of different criteria
which give priority for improvement based on: (a) worst enrivonmental condi-
tions; (b) high density; (c) oldest areas first; (d) closeness to existing
infrastructure networks; and (e) willingness and interest of community for
KIP. The programs have been adjusted to fall within the financial and imple-
mentation capacity of the local and central governments. The list of kampungs
slated for improvement in the program were agreed with the city governments
during appraisal and confirmed during negotiations and are in the project
file. Some flexibility will be necessary for adjustments to this list as
implementation proceeds.
B.  Policy on Physical Develpoment and Tenure in KIP Areas
4.02      Kampung improvement financed under the Bank loan will be new to 3
of the 5 project cities. It is therefore important that the principles and



- 27 -
major policy features of KIP are clear both to Government officials and to
project beneficiaries. In addition, stronger tenure is a feature of the new
program. It has been agreed by the Mayor of each of these cities (except
Jakarta where the KIP concepts are well established) that the KIP policy will
be incorporated in a KIP policy statement, which with minor variations would
state the following:
(a)  announce a 5-year program of kampung improvement which
will upgrade the environmentally depressed areas starting
with those where conditions are worst;
(b)  outline the components of the program involving drainage,
sanitation, footpath and vehicle access, water supply,
and community facilities;
(c)  a policy of only minimum disturbance of existing houses---
the KIP infrastructure will be designed to fit into the
existing layout of the kampung;
(d)  policy on compensation and relocation arrangements for
families whose houses have been eliminated by the project;
(e)  Hak guna bangunan title (long-term renewable ownership right)
or Hak Pakai (long-term right of use) will be offered for
sale to those families who were occupying on public land at
the date of occupant registration.
Most of the features of the KIP policy outlined above have been incorporated
in a Mayor's Decree for each city, ratified by their respective city councils.
The policy aspects which are common to all cities and/or those not covered by
the Mayor's Decrees will be incorporated in an implementation directive to be
issued by the Director General of PUOD in Dalam Negeri. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that this directive would be issued not later than April
1, 1979 in a form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Implementation Schedule
4.03      The project would be implemented over a 5-year period---April 1,
1979 to April 1, 1984. The implementation schedule is shown in Chart IV-1.
The initial key implementation actions, with responsibility and the latest
completion dates for the project, are as follows:

D. Procurement
4.04      Contracts for a total value estimated at about US$10.5 million, for
the procurement of equipment and vehicles for the solid wastes management
program and for the drainage improvement works, will be let on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. A
margin of preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower, will be applied to domestic bidders offering domestically manufactured
goods. Contracts, of a total estimated value of about US$68.9 million, will
be let on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures, acceptable to the
Bank, for the procurement of: (a) all infrastructure works, schools and
clinics for KIP; (b) depots, collection facilities and the access road for the
sanitary landfill sites; (c) dredging of canals and rehabilitation of punping
stations; and (d) furniture, equipment and supplies for the schools and health
facilities. Foreign contractors are not likely to be interested in bidding on
these works because of the large number of small contracts (about 200 contracls
of value ranging from $10,000 to $500,000) of short duration; the difficulty
of working in densely-inhabited kampungs; the need for close relationships
with the residents and local officials; and the labor-intensive nature of the
works. Medical supplies, equipment and vehicles for the health worker training
program, which would be required only in small quantities up to a total of
about $200,000, will be procured after local shopping.
4.05      All contractors for civil works and furniture will be registered
with the local government concerned and classified according to their experi-
ence, financial standing and performance on similar works. The list of
registered contractors will be updated each year to allow new contractors Lo
become eligible. The prequalification procedure followed will be reviewed by
the KIP consultants each year to ensure that it is in conformity with the
Bank Guidelines.

E. Disbursements
4.06      Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against the following:
(a) 50% of all expenditures for civil works in Jakarta
and 65% in other project cities;
(b) 65% of total costs of supplies and equipment procured locally;
(c) 100% of foreign exchange cost of imported vehicles and
equipment and 95% of local cost of equipment procured
under international competitive bidding;
(d) 40% of the cost of a few vehicles procured after local
shopping;
(e) 100% of expenditures for consultants services.
4.07      Documentation for contracts over $300,000 (over $500,000 for
Jakarta), including contract documents, would be sent to the Bank prior to
submission of application for disbursement. Documentation for contracts
costing less than $300,000 (under $500,000 for Jakarta) would be retained by
the KIP unit concerned and be available for inspection during the course of
supervision missions. The KIP consultants would review bids and bidding
procedures for all procurement and will prepare a report containing the bid
analyses and recommendations for award, which would be sent to the Bank prior
to submission of application for disbursement for the contract concerned.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is as follows:

The Closing Date will be December 31, 1984.
F. Accounts and Audits
4.08      Separate project accounts would be maintained by each municipal
government, giving separate breakdowns for land acquisition, civil works,
equipment (including vehicles), supplies and health worker training. The
project expenditures would be accounted for separately by category for each
fiscal year.  DKI and KMS would continue to use the accounting procedures
which have already been established satisfactorily in the first and second
projects. Consultants for accountancy services provided to Cipta Karya will
work with the other cities in establishing appropriate accounting procedures.
Each municipal government will arrange for an annual audit by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that such audits will be carried out, and that the annually audited records of
project accounts for each city would be submitted to the Bank no later than 9
months following the close of the fiscal year.



- 32 -
G. Operations and Maintenance
4.09      Maintenance of the project infrastructure and vehicles would be the
responsibility of the municipal government concerned. In Jakarta and Surabaya,
where a door-to-door system of solid wastes collection will be gradually intro-
duced over the project period, there would be a need to provide additional
recurrent expenditures for the increased staff and vehicle fleets. In Surabaya
expenditures on maintenance of the canals improved under the project will have
to be increased. In all cities, funds would be required to staff the schools
and clinics provided under the project. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that: (a) DKI and KMS will provide adequate funds each year to
cover the operation and maintenance of the solid wastes management system; (b)
KMS will provide adequate funds each year for maintenance of the drainage
canals; and (c) each municipal government will budget sufficient funds annually
to staff and operate the schools and clinics provided under the project.
Kampung residents organized by local leaders (RWs)'would maintain the communal
sanitary facilities and drains. It would be the responsibility of the lurah
(sub-district chief) to see that garbage is collected and deposited in the
neighborhood collection bins for removal by the Sanitation Department.
Over time, this function would be taken over completely by the Sanitation
Department as the SWIP Program is expanded.
H. Supervision
4.10      Supervision of the project on the part of the Government will be the
responsibility of Cipta Karya. Consultants financed under the project will
advise and assist Cipta Karya in this task. Supervision by Bank staff will
require approximately 25 man-weeks of field effort per year for 3 years and 15
man-weeks per year for the following 2 years. For every manweek in the field,
approximately 2 man-weeks of office work in Washington would be required.
I. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.11      A system of long-term monitoring of the project was initiated in
1975 with the objective of measuring the socioeconomic impact of the project.
A series of base line and follow-up survey, covering several kampungs before
and after improvement, has already been carried out. These data are being
evaluated, and an initial statement of the impact of the project and inferences
regarding its effectiveness will be available by June 1979. However, the
measurement of some of the benefits of KIP will be possible only over a longer
period of time. The project would, therefore, provide for continuing monitor-
ing over the next 3 years of selected kampungs in order to assess the impact
of the program over time. These surveys will deal with both socio-economic
and health-related benefits of KIP.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  MLunicpal Finances
Structure
5.01      Municipal local governiments in Indonesia are responsible for the
provision and maintenance of all urban services including health, primary
education, social welfare, water supply, sanitation, conservancy, roads, law
and order and general civic administration. With the exception of the water
supply service which is under a separate and autonomous municipal government-
owned enterprise (PAM), all expenditures (routine and development) for th'ese
services are met from the municipal budget. Municipal revenues, however, are
inadequate to meet the expenditures required to provide even a minimum basic
level of services.  Therefore, the cities rely heavily on the Central Covers-
ment for subsidies for both routine and development, expenditures (see para.
5.03 below). These subsidies typically represent 50-65% of the total municipal
budgets.
5.02      The principal sources of municipal revenues are fees and lice-nse
charges; entertainment tax; development tax levied on selected commercial
enterprises (e.g. hotels and restaurants); revenues from city-owned comrmercial
enterprises (e.g. markets, slaughter houses, terminals); and taxes anid feed on
automobiles.  Property tax (IPEDA), which is typically the single most ipot.
source of revenue (20-50%) for most cities in the world, accounts for onily
5-10% of the revenue for the Indonesian cities. The principal reasons for
the low yield from property taxes is the general weakness in property valuaio--;
a low coverage of the properties; and inadequate enforcement and follow up. A
property tax study in 1973 (Holland and Lerche study) indicated considezahlle
scope for obtaining substantially higher yields from IPEDA. While some
improvements have been achieved in some of the cities in the past 5 years,
inadequate records of land registration and a lack of qualified valuation
staff have so far prevented the introduction of the more fundamental changes
in the system. GOI recognizes these constraints and proposes to take several
measures under the project which should achieve significant improvemente X;-!
IPEDA (see para 5.14).
5.03      The principal Central Goverinment subsidies to the municipal g'
ments are: (a) for all personnel costs which typically account for 50% er
more of the routine expenitures; (b) subsidies for certain recurrent expendi-
tures for health and education, and (c) development subsidies (INPRES fundR)
for general infrastructure, schools, health centers, markets 1/ and coT lmmit y
development, the amounts of which are based primarily on popu1ation,
INPRES subsidies were started in 1974 to channel some of the increased--
revenues for local development projects and now represent a significant
part of the total development expenditures, varying from about 25% of i:-
total for the larger cities (e.g. Surabaya) increasing up to 70% for the
smaller cities (e.g. Surakarta).
1/   The market INPRES is actually a loan from the Central Govertnmert c;m
highly subsidized terms (interest free over 10 years after a 2-yc-
grace period).



- 34 -
5.04      All development expenditures are financed from current revenues and
from the Central Government subsidies discussed above. Municipal borrowings
are severely limited to only short-term commercial borrowings from the banks
because of a general absence of capital markets in Indonesia. There is no
established mechanism for long-term borrowings from the Government except for
a few projects financed primarily from external sources. The INPRES subsidies
are given by the Central Government annually for specific projects (except for
the general infrastructure INPRES). They are often used for small projects
dispersed over the city to maximize the population affected. These factors
limit the ability of the municipal government to undertake any significant
investment programs. The Government is currently studying the whole issue of
Central/Local Government financial relationships with a view to restructuring
the flow of funds to the cities in a way which would promote long-term plan-
ning and programming and encourage greater reliance on local resources.
Muncipal Finances: Jakarta
5.05      Jakarta so far is the only city in Indonesia which has been success-
ful in achieving a major increase in its resource base in the last few years.
In 1977/78, Jakarta's total resources are estimated to be Rp 110.7 billion
(US$270 million), representing a 38% increase over the previous year. For the
5 years between 1972/73 and 1977/78 inclusive, total municipal resources have
increased at an average annual rate of over 50%. This represents a signific-
ant increase in real terms, as the Jakarta price index in this period has
increased by about 170%. While a part of this increase has resulted from
larger transfers from the Central Government, Jakarta's self-generated revenues
have increased significantly as well. Since 1974, Jakarta's total revenues
have increased by 72% and self-generated revenues by about 60%. Starting from
a very low base, property tax revenue (IPEDA) increased by an average rate of
over 50% per annum between 1970-75, but grew at a slower pace (19% per annum)
in the last 2 years. However, revenue from IPEDA in relation to the total
municipal revenues continued to be insignificant (less than 5%).
5.06      Thus, over the past 5-8 years, Jakarta has achieved a substantial
degree of financial self-sufficiency. This has been partially achieved by
tapping some unconventional and ingenous sources of revenues like the casino
tax and automobile related taxes which in 1977/78 accounted for 16% and 26%
respectively of municipal revenues. The Central Government transfers, although
still representing an important part of Jakarta's total resources, are no
longer critical for the city. For example, Jakarta could cover all of its
current expenditures from its own tax resources and still be able to devote
40% of the same for development expenditures. Even with substantially
smaller increases--about 10% in real terms per year--in its self-generated
revenues in the future, it could sustain an increasing development budget if
the Central Government subsidies were maintained at the 1977/78 level in real
terms (see para 5.13).
Municipal Finance: Secondary Cities
5.07      Finances of the secondary cities are much weaker compared to those
of Jakarta, and there is a considerable variation among the different cities.
A summary breakdown of the resources and expenditures for each of the project
cities in 1977/78, as compared with those in Jakarta, is as follows:



- 35 -
Expenditures                 Resources                  Per Capita
Routine  DevelNpet  Local  Central  Loans  Total   Revenues  Resource
--Rp million------- Rp--------
Jakarta        44,880    65,485    68,910   31,795  9,660  110,365  11,240          18,000
Surabaya        3,985      7,675      6,010    3,000  2,650   11,660   3,080        5,980
Ujung Pandang   1,990      1,670      1,685    1,775    205    3,665   3,505         7,615
Semarang        1,855      2,590      1,705    2,160    580    4,445   2,245        5,855
Surakarta       1,195      1,120        860    1,105    350    2,315   1,830        4,925
These cities rely to a much greater degree, on Central Government budgetary
support for both current and development expenditures. The proportion of
Central Government subsidies (including market INPRES loans) is generally
greater for the smaller secondary cities. In 1977/78 it varied from 45% of
the total resources for Surabaya to 54% for Ujung Pandang to 63% for Semarang
and Surakarta. Except for Surabaya, none of the other secondary cities
generate sufficient revenues themselves to meet even their current expenditures.
As in the case of Jakarta, Central Government subsidies provide for all
expenditures on municipal administration and security and the INPRES subsidies
for development expenditures.
5.08      Recurrent expenditures consume a substantially larger proportion of
total resources in the smaller secondary cities, accounting for (in 1977/78)
55% and 52% of the total resources respectively in Ujung Pandang and Surakarta.
In comparison, the corresponding figures for Surabaya and Jakarta are 35% and
40% respectively. With a low-revenue base to start with, investments in
development projects have therefore been severely limited.
5.09      The trends in the finances of the local governments also vary
considerably among the secondary cities. Between 1975 and 1977, the total
resources available to all cities increased significantly (by over 60%, except
for Ujung Pandang, which received a large one-time subsidy from the Central
Government in 1975). However, except for Surabaya, much of this increase
resulted from increased Central Government subsidies. Self-generated revenues
increased merely by 33%, 21% and 30% respectively in Ujung Pandang, Semarang
and Surakarta. Taking into account price increases of about 30% in this
period and the increase in population in each of the cities, self-generated
revenues have in fact declined in real terms.  The Central Government has
indicated that subsidies in the next plan are not likely to increase from
their present levels. For these cities to undertake their critically needed
development programs it would be necessary to make efforts to augment munici-
pal taxes. As in Jakarta, there is considerable scope of achieving increased
yields from property taxes (IPEDA), which represent 5% or less of the muni-
cipal revenues and vary from Rp 100 (Surakarta) to Rp 600 (Surabaya) per
capita. Other sources like the development tax could also be utilized more
effectively in these cities as is being done in Jakarta.

B. Impact of Project on Municipal Finances
Financial Implications
5.10      The project would involve a substantial commitment of resources on
the part of the municipal governments concerned in several ways. First,
during the project period, the municipal governments will finance 30% (50% in
the case of Jakarta) of their respective project costs from their own resources.
Second, they will bear the debt burden (principal and interest) of their loans
from the World Bank and the Central Government over a period of 15 years. The
municipal governments of Jakarta and Surabaya, in addition, must repay their
loans from the first 2 urban projects. Finally, the project would require
increased allocation for recurrent expenditures for maintenance of the
improved kampungs, for improved solid wastes services in Jakarta and Surabaya
and for maintenance of drainage canals in Surabaya. This burden would be
substantial for most of the cities because KIP, the drainage improvements and
most likely the solid wastes management program, would not generate any direct
cash returns (see paras 5.11 and 5.12 below).
Cost Recovery
5.11      The financing mechanism for KIP in Indonesia, which has evolved over
the past 5 years with the 2 Bank-financed projects, relies entirely on
municipal resources. There are no direct levies like a betterment tax or plot
charges imposed on the residents. There are various reasons for GOI and the
Bank adopting this mechanism. First, the types of urban services provided
under KIP are similar to those routinely provided to the higher-income neighbor-
hoods without levying any charges. The Government has taken the view that to
institute a special tax on KIP beneficiaries would be inequitable. Second,
the argument in favor of direct levies on beneficiaries rests on the desire to
assure that the program can be sustained over the long term so that the
services can be provided to all kampung areas. The Government has addressed
this issue by: (a) an explicit focus on the standards employed, with an aim to
keeping these at a minimum level consistent with achieving the health objec-
tives of the projct and (b) ensuring that the municipal taxes increase at a
sufficient rate to pay for an expanding program (see para 5.18 below). Third,
and most importantly, imposition of direct levies (e.g. plot charges) on
beneficiaries would require a massive effort in cadastral surveys and in
clarification and registration of tenure for each of the large number of
families benefitting annually from the program. Such an effort is beyond the
administrative capacity of the local governments and the Central Government.
Finally, collection would have to be spread over time and, in many instances,
the cost of collection may exceed the revenues generated.
5.12      At present, the municipal governments levy no direct charge on the
residents for solid wastes collection, since the municipal services cover only
the transportation of solid wastes from the collection points to the disposal
sites. The residents themselves organize the collection for which they use
either self-help (generally in the poorer neighborhoods) or make contributions



- 37 -
to a community fund, which in turn pays for private collection services.
However, under the proposed project, the collection responsibility would
gradually shift fromi the conmmunity to the municipality thus requiring inree
outlays from the municipal budgets. The most appropriate mechanism for
charging for this service is not clear. It is estimated that a direct o:
of about Rp 250-375 (US$0.40--0.60) per month per family would be suf,icJf' .,ini-.
pay for the collection services. It is not clear whether it would be admini-s-
tratively cost-effective to collect such small individual charges.  Also,
there is concern that the low-income families may not be willing/able to rpay
for these charges, since they may not fully appreciate the need or be-mefii ff
door-to-door collection service. Interruption of services for even a few
families in a neighborhood would cause public health problems for the entire
community or for others who are affected by water pollution resulting from
garbage dumped in the waterways. Because of these reasons, many cities preife.
to finance garbage collection and disposal services from general revennues
During the first 2 years of the project, a study will be carried out ia eacn-
city to determine the most appropriate mechanism of charging for solid wEste-.:
services. One or more different methods will be tried out on a pilot scn.Ji_
before making final recommendations for the city as a whole.
Projections of MuniciDal Budgets
5.13      The ability of the local governments concerned to be able to a.YsorlL
their share of the project in their anticipated development budgets was one of
the main considerations (besides demand and implementation capacity) in
determining the project size. Ten-year perspective budgets for each of
project cities are given in Tables V-1 and V-2.  These projections ass siae ts
(a) the Central Government subsidies for the secondary cities would rema:inr
constant in the future at their present per-capita levels in real terms,. ew<
for Jakarta they would be maintained constant in real terms at their
levels; (b) each city would continue to undertake similar projects in t'--
10 years at the same level as the present project; (c) the other devel...le,-.l.
expenditures would continue to increase in real terms (or that KIP wou:1h1 L-K
accelerated); and (d) the share of the secondary cities in the project
would increase from 30% in the present project to 50% or more in 10 years0 TfY
order for the cities to be able to afford an expanding program of tlhis   rn.
and at the same time meet their obligations for debt service and rec'u.r.L-
expenditures, it would be necessary for their self-generated revenues tn
increase by about 5% per annum in real per-capita terms, and for the             :
collections of the secondary cities to increase by about 25-30% per ann,-,
(representing a 10-15% increase in real per-capita terms) during RepeLiAt. :--.
(1979-84). The 5% real increase in general municipal tax revenues would be in
line with the anticipated growth of GDP. However, the proposed increases !.;n
IPEDA would require a commitment on the part of the local governments anc..
Central Government to introduce specific improvements in IPEDA of thbe
similar to those introduced in Jakarta and Surabaya in the past 5 y
These include periodically reclassifying areas into different value zones as
the physical conditions in the areas change; making periodic adjustment- ..m
the coefficient used to determine the level of tax; updating the land-val,e
map to provide reference information on property values in different pari.:s. oi

TrOTE:  The Indonesian Rupiah was devalued by 500 in November 1978. The project costs were revised as a result cf the revised contingencies expected after the devaluation.
The financial prcjections given here do not take into account the effect of these changes because it is expected that the general thrust of the financial analysis
oreserted will not be affected materially.

the city; and increasing the collection rate from about 50% in 1970 to 75% in
1976. The suggested increases in IPEDA for the secondary cities represent a
realistic level of performance and will be sufficient to meet the debt 6eiv-ce
and current obligations of the cities arising from the project. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the municipal governments of Surabaya,
Ujung Pandang, Semarang and Surakarta and the Ministry of Finance of the
Government of Indonesia would achieve an average annual increase of at least
30% in IPEDA tax collections between 1978/79 and 1983/84. Technical assistance
provided under the project would assist in the strengthening of the IPEDA
office of the Ministry of Finance which assists the local governments in
updating property valuation maps.
5.14      While in the short term it may be necessary to look for ways in
which the yield from IPEDA could be increased, in the longer term it would be
essential that more fundamental changes are made in the system. IPEDA has the
potential of becoming the major source of revenues for the cities, and it
should be exploited to meet the growing resource needs of the cities. The
Government recognizes this and has under consideration several measures which
would achieve a greater yield from IPEDA. As a first step, it proposes to
move to market values as the basis for assessment of property taxes rather
than using rental values, which is the current practice. This would make
assessments across properties more equitable and introduce a certain amount of
buoyancy in the tax bases. As a part of the project, the Government has
agreed to initiate a systematic program of property valuation in Surabaya
which would: (a) provide training to IPEDA staff in property valuation; (b)
review and update the recommendations of the previous studies (Holland and
Lerche) and design a long-term program for implementation; and (c) initiate a
5-10-year program of complete valuation of properties. These measures would
go a long way in improving the present system, which relies on only selective
assessment of properties. Terms of reference for the consultants provided to
implement this program were be agreed during negotiations. Assurances were
obtained from the Government that the Ministry of Finance would: (a) employ
the necessary consultants to design the revised system and train the necessary
staff; (b) submit for discussion with the Bank not later than September 30,
1979 the revised system of property valuation of Surabaya based on the recom-
mendations of the consultants; and (c) initiate not later than December 31,
1979 a program of staff training acceptable to the Bank, for the purpose of
implementing this system.
C. Replicability
5.15      The approach to kampung improvement being followed by the Government
has already demonstrated in Jakarta its ability to sustain the program at a
desirable scale of operation. The Jakarta KIP is unique in having been suc-
cessful in providing basic services to virtually all of the unserviced areas
in the city in 12 years. Each of the other cities included in the project has
developed a 5-year program of kampung improvement. An estimated 35% of the
population living in unserviced areas in Surabaya (including the 15% served



- 41 -
under the second project), 34% in Ujung Pandang, 15% in Semarang and 16% in
Surakarta would have been covered at the end of the project period (1981/82).
If the pace of the program is maintained in the Luture, all unserviced kampung
areas in these cities could be serviced in a period of 10-15 years.
5.16      Based on the unit costs estimated for the proposed project, a national
program covering 65% of the country's urban population (assumed to be living
in unserviced areas) would cost roughly $550 million, taking into account the
investments which have already been made in Jakarta and Surabaya. A 15-year
program of kampung improvement would, therefore, require capital investments
amounting to about $35 million per annum in 1978 prices. Assuming growth of
5-7% per year for the slum area population following the present trends, an
additional $20 million would be required each year during this 15-year period
to deal with population growth. Thus the total annual outlay required would
be roughly $55 million (December 1978 prices). This level of investment would
be about 1.5% of total Central Government development expenditures and less
than 0.2% of GDP. This is considered to be well within the level of invest-
ments on shelter affordable by countries at Indonesia's stage of development.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
6.01      The benefits of the proposed project fall into two categories:  (a)
direct service benefits to project beneficiaries and (b) institution building
effects of project implementation. In brief, the direct service benefits are
those outlined below:
(a)  KIP in the 5 project cities will provide basic urban infra-
structure, including water supply, drainage, and waste
disposal systems, roads, footpaths, schools and clinics to
approximately 765,000 kampung residents at an average cost
of about US$45/capital (December 1978 prices). An additional
1.4 million in Jakarta will benefit from the extension of
water and sanitation services at a cost of US$7.50 per capita.
It will alleviate the extreme unhygienic living conditions
in the kampungs and consequently have a major impact on
public health.
(b)  The infrastructure works proposed under the project would
provide an economic stimulus to the kampungs by improving
services and access to small kampung businesses and raising
human productivity through better hygiene, health care and
education.
(c)  The proposed health program for Jakarta and Surabaya would train
and equip 800 community health workers to deliver advisory and
curative services to 450,000 kampung residents at an average cost
of US$2/capita. This cost would cover design and purchase of
training materials, as well as training, equipment and honoraria
(for a one-year period) for health workers.



- 42 -
(d) The solid wastes management program would extend organized
refuse collection and drain cleaning service to 2 million
people in Jakarta and Surabaya (roughly 25% of the population
in each city) at an average annual cost of US$2.50/capita.
Initiation of an effective solid wastes collection and disposal
system in Jakarta and Surabaya would check the rising pollution
and clogging of surface water channels in these cities,
reduce the risk of flooding which arises as accumulated
garbage diminishes the capacity of storm water drains, and
make a major contribution to the control of filth-borne
diseases.
(e) Finally, the project would create a significant number of jobs
in the construction and operation of the works. An estimated
60,000 man-years of employment would be created, largely for
unskilled labor, in the civil works construction programs
alone for kampung improvement, drainage improvement and
solid waste management.
6.02      No less important than the direct service benefits of the proposed
project are the institution-building effects it is expected to have. The
project would require establishment of KIP units in Semarang, Ujung Pandang
and Surakarta. It would develop the capacity of these units to plan and
implement slum upgrading projects, as well as shape the municipalities'
overall approach to urban shelter and infrastructure, by demonstrating the
efficacy of a policy of widespread upgrading. In addition, the project would
draw local agencies in Jakarta and Surabaya into initiating an efficient yet
labor-intensive system of solid waste collection and disposal. It would allow
these agencies to test and modify, as necessary, the new solid wastes manage-
ment system in preparation for extending the system to fully cover both
cities. Finally, the project would initiate the process of strengthening the
cities fiscal base, particularly through much needed improvements in property
taxes.
Economic Analysis
6.03      Quantitative evaluation of the benefits of KIP was based on the
estimated increase in property values brought about by the provision of
infrastructure and services. Although certain project benefits may be only
indirectly and imperfectly reflected in the market value of property in the
project area (e.g. increased human productivity via improved health), it is
believed that property values provide a useful indicator of the minimum value
of project outputs. Project cost estimates used in the economic analysis
include all net of tax costs of infrastructure, including design and supervi-
sion costs, costs of operation and maintenance, and physical and price contin-
gencies. Only the costs of schools and clinics are excluded, as the benefits
of these facilities are imperfectly perceived and do not appear to be reflected
in property values. Within this framework, the economic rates of return for
the proposed kampung improvement programs in Jakarta and Surabaya are 78% and
over 100% respectively. It is likely that since KIP provides for a major
expansion of serviced areas in each of the cities, the increase in property



43 -
values may be less than the present value differential between serviced and
unser-viced areas.  It is difficult to forecast the extent to which the differ-
ential may be reduced. However, sensitivity analysis indicates that a 50%
reduction in benefits would still yield a rate of return of 28% in Jakarta
and 52% in Surabaya. The high rate of return of the project is an indication
of the extreme shortage of serviced land in Indonesia's urban areas. There
has been no experience yet with KIP in other cities; the economic rate of
return in these cities for KIP is expected to be comparable to Jakarta and
Surabaya. It is not possible to quantify the benefits of the other project
components as they yield either primarily health-related benefits or improved
productivity which cannot be measured. The estimated weighted average rate of
return for the entire kampung improvement portion of the project, which
accounts for 65% of total project cost, is 85%.
Impact on the Urban Poor
6.04      The urban kampungs in Indonesia are populated by a relatively wide
range of income groups. Any kampung improvement effort, then, inevitably
affects both lower and middle-income people. In Jakarta, surveys have demon-
strated that 70% of kampung dwellers fall within the Urban Poverty Task
Force's defined poverty target group. Thus, it can be expected that roughly
70% of the beneficiaries of the Jakarta KIP effort may be numbered among the
urban poor. In the 4 secondary cities, surveys show that 75-80% of each
city's overall population falls within the urban poverty target group. Since
KIP is either new or in its early stages in these cities, and therefore
still focused on the kampungs that exhibit the worst environmental conditions,
it is estimated that at least 80% of the beneficiaries of KIP in these cities
will be below the poverty level. Overall, then, at least 75% of the proposed
KIP's direct beneficiaries (i.e. roughly 1.63 million people) would be from
the urban poverty target group. The solid wastes management component, like
KIP, would affect a range of income groups. However, it would be initiated in
the lower-income kelurahans in Jakarta and Surabaya, and would thus dispropor-
tionately benefit the urban poor. Finally, the community health and small-
business development programs are both designed to offer services to those
whose weak economic position makes it difficult for them to obtain either
credit, management training or health care. Kampung selection guidelines and
eligibility criteria for these programs will be specially tailored to ensure
that the focus is on service to the low-income target group. It is estimated
that about $62 million of the project cost (i.e. 65% of the total) can be
attributed as directly benefitting the population from the urban poverty
group.
Project Risks
6.05      The chief risk of the proposed project stems from the local govern-
ment's inexperience with kampung improvement. In the three smaller cities,
Semarang, Ujung Pandang and Surakarta, KIP units are only now being created.
A great deal will depend on the ability of the local governments to mobilize
competent teams of people to execute the KIP program. The project provides
for technical assistance to strengthen the nascent KIP units. In addition,
close supervision by Cipta Karya, Dalam Negeri and the Bank will be required
to ensure timely and competent execution of the project.
