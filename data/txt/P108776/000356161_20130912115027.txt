A. SUMMARY

1. The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to seek approval by the Regional Vice
President for a Level II restructuring of the Mongolia Education for All Fast-Track
Initiative Project. The proposed restructuring is intended to: (a) extend the project closing
date by 12 months from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013; and (b) adjust the
results framework indicators and targets to reflect the extension periods, facilitate
measuring progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) and
track the required core indicators. The extension was requested by the Mongolian
Ministry of Finance in a letter dated October 25, 2012. The proposed changes to the
Results Framework have been discussed and agreed with the Ministry of Education and
Science during the course of project supervision.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. Background. The Mongolian EFA-FTI Project is financed by the international donor
community and administered by the World Bank. The objective of EFA-FTI (now known
as the Global Partnership for Education) is to provide financial assistance to help low-
and middle-income countries around the world achieve the Millennium Development
Goal (MDG) on education. Mongolia was approved by the EFA-FTI Board of Directors
to receive a Catalytic Fund Grant of $29.4 million to cover the period from 2007 to 2009,
and the Project became effective on March 16, 2007. The original Grant Agreement was
amended each year to reflect the content of each year’s technical proposal and
procurement plan, which were approved by the local donor group, the Education Donors’
Consultative Mechanism (EDCM).

3. The Project has four components:

      Extending Access through school construction and rehabilitation and the
       provision of equipment, furniture, learning materials;
      Improving Pre-school Education through the creation of mobile ger-
       kindergartens and the provision of learning materials and teacher training;
      Creating safer and healthier learning environments by providing adequate and
       continuous in-service training; and
      Grant management.

4. Progress to date. The Project has successfully improved the teaching and learning
environment in Mongolian schools. It has provided universal coverage in training of first
grade and dormitory teachers, training of teachers in Ulaanbaatar Teachers’ College, and
mobile ICT teaching stations. The Project has also provided mobile ger-kindergarten
services to herders and rehabilitated schools throughout the country. In terms of
disbursements, all tranches were released by August 2010 and 94.52 percent has been
documented. The closing date for this Project has previously been extended twice for a
                                             1
cumulative total of three years. The only outstanding activity is the construction of a
school complex in Baganuur, a mining town. The school complex is critical for the
country and affected school children, and US$1.6 million remains in the designated
account for its construction. There are no financial management issues at the Project
level. There are no outstanding audit reports or reports that are not satisfactory to the
Bank.

5. Rationale for Extension. The proposed extension is necessary to complete the
construction of a school complex in the Baganuur district of Ulaanbaatar, which is a high
priority educational intervention for the Government. Baganuur’s schools are
overcrowded, operate in three shifts, and are in poor conditions. Completion of the school
is critical to alleviate overcrowding of existing schools, as well as extend the instructional
hours of all students in the area, which have been cut short because of triple shifting. This
will help improve student learning and the quality of education for the 640 students who
will attend the Baganuur school, as well as the 480 students who will attend the other
schools in the district.

6. Reasons for delays. Project implementation was delayed for several reasons,
including: (i) a booming construction market and rising construction costs; (ii) limited
financial ability of the hired firm; (iii) limited ability of the Ministry to supervise; (iv)
contractual issues between the Ministry and the contractor; and (v) extremely heavy
summer rains in 2012. To overcome these issues and make up for some of the time lost,
the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) and the contractor have agreed to a set of
measures to complete Project implementation by December 31, 2013, including: (a)
detailed milestones to monitor the implementation of the contract; (b) amendments to the
contract in view of the expected final completion date; (c) penalties for failure to achieve
milestones; and (d) cash flow requirements. Moreover, MES has strengthened its
construction supervision and management team by including two more experienced
engineers in the Client Construction Unit and providing additional resources and vehicles
for them to function effectively. It also secured additional funds (US$1.8 million) from
next year’s state budget to complete the Baganuur school. The Bank and an independent
team of engineers have reviewed these measures and are satisfied with the agreements
reached between MES and the contractor, as well as the additional steps MES has taken
to strengthen its oversight. The Bank will closely monitor progress against these
milestones. All sides are aware that should further delays occur, the Bank may suspend
the grant for lack of implementation progress before the December 2013 closing date.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7. The following changes are proposed to the project:

      Closing Date. The Project closing date would be extended by 12 months from
       December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013.
      Results Framework. The original results framework was adjusted to reflect the
       extension periods, facilitate measuring progress towards achieving the Project
       Development Objectives (PDO) and track the required core indicators.



                                              2
8. No changes are proposed to the Project’s Development Objective, components,
safeguards classification, institutional arrangements, financing, financial management, or
procurement.
