Part D:   Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.   Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final
contracts:
     (a)  With respect to  the  first  three contracts financed by
each Financial Intermediary  and  Executing Agency, the procedures
set forth in paragraphs 2  and  4  of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines
shall apply. When payments for such contract are to be made out of
the Special Account, such  procedures  shall be modified to ensure
that the two  conformed  copies  of  the  contract  required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant  to  said  paragraph 2 (d) shall be
furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out
of the Special Account in respect of such contract.
     (b)  With  respect  to  each  contract  not  governed  by the
preceding paragraph, the procedures set  forth in paragraphs 3 and
4 of Appendix 1 to  the  Guidelines shall apply. When payments for
such contract are to  be  made  out  of  the Special Account, such
procedures shall be  modified  to  ensure  that  the two conformed
copies  of  the  contract  together  with  the  other  information
required to be furnished to the  Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3
shall be furnished to  the  Bank  as  part  of  the evidence to be
furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
     (c)  The provisions of  the  preceding  subparagraphs (a) and
(b) shall not apply to contracts  on account of which the Bank has
authorized withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  on  the basis of
statements of expenditure.  Such  contracts  shall  be retained in
accordance with  Section  4.01  (c)  (ii)  of  this Agreement, the
Guarantee Agreement, the BANCOMEXT Project Agreement and the FONEI
Project Agreement.
2.   The  figure  of  20%  is  hereby  specified  for  purposes of
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.
Section II.   Employment of Consultants
     Whenever consultants are employed  to  assist in the carrying
out of the  Project,  such  consultants shall have qualifications,
experience and terms and  conditions of employment satisfactory to
the Bank. Such consultants  shall  be  selected in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of
the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers
and by the World Bank  as  Executing Agency" published by the Bank
in August 1981.
                            SCHEDULE 5
                          Special Account
1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)  the term  "Eligible  Categories"  means  Categories (1),
Page  16
through (4) as set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1
to this Agreement;
     (b)  the term "Eligible  Expenditures"  means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost  of goods and services required for
the Project and to be  financed  out  of  the proceeds of the Loan
allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  Eligible  Categories  in
accordance with the provisions  of  Schedule  1 to this Agreement;
and
     (c)  the term "Initial Deposit" means an amount equivalent to
twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) to be withdrawn from the
Loan Account and  deposited  in  the  Special  Account pursuant to
paragraph 3 of this Schedule.
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for Eligible Expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this  Schedule.  The  Borrower  shall  make  withdrawals  from the
Special Account for payments of Eligible Expenditures on the basis
of the evidence that  the  Bank  shall have reasonably determined,
and shall debit the Special Account  with the amount in dollars so
withdrawn or with the dollar equivalent of the currency other than
dollars in which the payment was  made, determined on the basis of
the rate of  exchange  between  the  dollar  and  such currency in
effect: (i) on the date each  payment shall have been made, if the
payment has taken place  within  90  days  before  the date of the
withdrawal in question has  been requested, provided however, that
in respect  of  Eligible  Expenditures  under  Subloans  or Direct
Investments, such 90-day period shall  be counted as from the date
on which the Bank dispatches  its:  (A) approval of the Subloan or
Direct Investment, or  (B)  authorization  of withdrawals from the
Loan Account  in  respect  of  Free-limit  Subloans and Free-limit
Investments; or (ii) on the  date  each withdrawal shall have been
made.
3.   The Bank may, at  the  request  of  the Borrower, withdraw on
behalf of the Borrower from the  Loan Account and deposit into the
Special Account the Initial Deposit.  Thereafter, and on the basis
of  requests  by  the  Borrower  furnished  to  the  Bank  at such
intervals as the Bank  shall  specify,  the  Bank shall further so
withdraw from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the Special
Account such amounts as shall be required to replenish the Special
Account for Eligible Expenditures, but only to the extent that the
amount of any such deposit,  together with any amount remaining on
deposit in the Special  Account  as  of  the date of such request,
shall not exceed, in the  aggregate, the equivalent of the Initial
Deposit. Except as the Bank may otherwise agree, each such deposit
after the Initial Deposit shall be  withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective  Eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by the
evidence  supporting  the  request   for  such  deposit  furnished
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.
4.   Prior to or at the time of each request by the Borrower for a
deposit by the Bank  into  the  Special  Account after the Initial
Deposit, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank in respect of each
payment made by  the  Borrower  out  of  the Special Account, such
documents and other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request,
showing that such payment was made for Eligible Expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph  3  of  this
Schedule, when the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the Categories,  minus  the  amount  of any outstanding special
commitment entered into by  the  Bank  pursuant to Section 5.02 of
the General Conditions, shall be  equal to the equivalent of twice
the amount of the  Initial  Deposit,  the  Bank shall be entitled,
after consultation with the Borrower,  to reduce the percentage of
disbursements for Eligible Expenditures  or  take any other action
which will ensure the Bank  that  by  the time of disbursements of
the total  amount  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan,  all deposits
(including the Initial Deposit made  by  the Bank into the Special
Account) were made for Eligible Expenditures.
Page  17
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall  have  determined that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any
amount not eligible  for  financing  by  withdrawal  from the Loan
Account; or (ii) was not  justified by the documentation furnished
pursuant to paragraph 4 above,  the Bank shall notify the Borrower
of such circumstances, and if, after  a period of 30 days from the
issuance of such notice,  an  amount  equal  to the amount of such
payment or the portion  thereof  not  so eligible or justified has
not been deposited by the Borrower into the Special Account or, if
the Bank shall so request,  refunded,  to  the Bank, the Bank may,
without in  any  way  restricting  or  limiting  any other rights,
power, or remedy of  the  Bank  under  the Loan Agreement, refrain
from making further deposits into such Account.
     (b)  If any amount  outstanding  in  the Special Account will
not  be  required   to   cover   further   payments  for  Eligible
Expenditures, the Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon notice from the
Bank, and unless otherwise agreed by  the Bank, refund to the Bank
such amount then outstanding in  the Special Account for crediting
to the Loan Account and immediate cancellation.

               and (B) without any  limitation upon the foregoing,
               such insurance shall cover  hazards incident to the

               place  of  use   or   installation,  any  indemnity

               Industrial  Enterprise  or  Equity  Subborrower  to
               perform its obligations under its contract with the
               Executing Agency  or  a  Financial Intermediary, as
               the case may be.
4.   Maximum Amount for Subloans and Direct Investments
     (a) No Subloan  or  Direct  Investment  shall  be  made in an
amount which, when  added  to  all  other outstanding amounts made
available   by   the   Executing   Agencies   and   any  Financial
Intermediaries to  the  Subborrower  or  Industrial  Enterprise in
question, financed or proposed to  be financed out of the proceeds
of the Loan,  shall  be  in  excess  of  the equivalent of fifteen
million dollars ($15,000,000).
     (b) The portion  of  expenditures  of  each  Subproject to be
financed by a Subloan  or  a  Direct  Investment shall be not less
than 20 percent, unless  the  Bank  shall, on a case-by-case basis
agree to a lesser percentage, and  not more than 50 percent of the
total cost  of  the  Subproject.    Notwithstanding  the foregoing
maximum amount of 50 percent, the Bank may permit in respect of an
individual Subproject,  that  the  portion  of  expenditures to be
financed by the respective  Subloan  or  Direct Investment be more
than 50 percent but not more than  80 percent of the total cost of
the Subproject if and to the  extent the Bank is provided evidence
satisfactory  to  it  of   underfinancing   on  account  of  prior
Subprojects by the  respective  Executing  Agency. For purposes of
the foregoing sentence,  "underfinancing"  by  an Executing Agency
shall have occurred if disbursements made by such Executing Agency
out of the proceeds of  the  Loan  on account of prior Subprojects
Page  21
have constituted  less  than  50  percent  of  the aggregate total
expenditures of such prior Subprojects.
