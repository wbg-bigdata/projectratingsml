REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
CIMENTERIE DE L'ORIENTAL WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR THE CIOR CEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Cimenterie de l'Oriental (CIOR), for the equivalent of US$45 million, with
the guarantee of the Kingdom of Morocco to help finance the CIOR Cement
Project. The loan would have a term of 14 years, including three years of
grace, with interest at 8.50 percent per annum. The Government of Morocco
would charge CIOR a guarantee fee of 1.5 percent per annum on the outstanding
amount of the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to CIOR to 10 percent
per annum. The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (the Arab Fund)
is expected to provide parallel financing for the project in the amount of
Kuwaiti Dinars (KD) 7 million (US$24.5 million equivalent, see para. 46). The
Arab Fund loan would have a term of 17 years, including 3 years of grace, with
interest at 6.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Morocco" (1021-MOR, dated January 26, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on February 13, 1976. An updating economic mission visited Morocco
in June 1976, and the following is based on this mission's findings.
3.        During the 1968-72 Plan, Morocco succeeded in accelerating the
growth of its economy and in improving the situation of its external payments.
Aided substantially by good crops following favorable weather in three years
out of five, real GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent per annum during the five-
year period. Reflecting the sustained rise in exports during the Plan period
and a slower growth of imports in 1971 and 1972, the balance of payments showed
a surplus from 1969 onward. These results represented a definite improvement
over those of the preceding decade, during which the rate of real GDP growth
had barely exceeded that of population growth, and the balance of payments
had been a source of constant concern. These achievements were accompanied
by an increase in private consumption averaging about 2 percent per capita
in real terms during the five-year period.
4.        From 1967 to 1970, the main growth determinants had been exports,
tourism and investment, all of which rose substantially; in addition sizeable
stocks were accumulated following the exceptionally good harvest in 1968.
By contrast, in 1971-72, exports and tourism together with current govern-
ment spending were the major factors to sustain economic growth. During
1/   This part has been slightly revised from President's Report No. P1966-MOR
on a Third Agricultural Credit Project, dated December 21, 1976.

- 2 -
these last two years of the Plan, the investment of public and semi-public
enterprises declined, largely because the state-owned phosphate company
(OCP) had completed its expansion program. Government investment stagnated
after 1968. Private investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the face
of political developments in 1971 and 1972 and in the expectation of new
measures to encourage investment and exports. At the end of the 1968-72
Plan period, there was therefore an urgent need to revive public and private
investment. Particularly in the public sector, absorptive capacity needed to
be increased by appropriate changes in staffing and organization.
5.        Following a long period of very slow growth in private consumption,
social problems had to be tackled. Over the 1969-71 period, there had been
a slow but perceptible decline in real per capita consumption for about one-
third of the rural population.   Wealth and income differences between cities
and villages, among regions, and between rich and poor tended to widen.     Un-
employment remained high, in 1971 averaging 9 percent of the country's labor
force, and ranging between 12 and 16 percent in large urban centers.
6.        Recognizing these difficulties and problems, the Government began
in 1971 to revise its development policies, paying increasing attention to
social objectives. The changed orientations were reflected in the 1973-77
Plan which aims at (1) GDP growth of 7.5 percent per annum in real terms from
1973 to 1977, mainly through a sharp increase in public and private investment
and a strategy geared strongly toward increasing exports; and (2) an improve-
ment in the distribution of growth benefits among the different social groups
and the various regions, in order to achieve greater equity and at the same
time increase domestic demand. This improvement was to be brought about
through a modest program of distributing colon lands to poor farmers, more
emphasis on the development of rainfed agriculture, "Moroccanization" of some
industrial and commercial enterprises, a price and wage policy designed to
enable the poorest segments of the population to satisfy their essential
needs, an ambitious program of low-cost housing, various measures to improve
the lot of the rural poor, and increased emphasis on the development of
poorest regions.
7.        In 1974 and 1975, Morocco benefitted from a large increase in the
average export price of phosphate, its main export product, which provided
substantial additional resources compared to the Plan's expectation. The
Government decided to step up investment spending for the years 1975-77,
and the allocations for investment by the public and semi-public sectors
were increased substantially in the 1975 and 1976 Budget Laws. Part of the
additional allocations were to cover investment cost increases, and a larger
part to launch expanded or new investment programs.
Recent Economic Performance
8.        During the first three years of the 1973-77 Plan period, Morocco's
overall economic performance improved substantially as compared to the past.
Gross fixed investment rose sharply and reached 24 percent of GDP in 1975 or
twice the 1972 level; investments in the public and semi-public sectors con-
tributed strongly to this increase and there was also a good response on the



- 3 -
part of private investors to the new incentives introduced in 1973. Indus-
trial growth accelerated to an average annual rate of 11.5 percent for the
first three years of the Plan compared to 6 percent in 1968-72, in large
part because of the vigorous expansion of construction in response to rising
investment demand. At the same time, increased emphasis was put on achieving
the social objectives of the 1973-77 Plan with the implementation of an
accelerated low-cost housing program, expanded investments in social sectors
in small cities, and a program of small-scale investments in disfavored
regions. In the face of import price rises, especially for wheat, sugar and
edible oil, the Government also raised significantly price subsidies for these
essential foodstuffs and adjusted upward legal minimum wages in agriculture
and industry with a view to protecting the purchasing power of low-income
groups.
9.        Some weaknesses appeared, however, during this period.    After the
five-fold increase in phosphate exports receipts between 1973 and 1974, which
had led the Government to revise upward the Plan's allocations for 1975-77,
expected further increases in financial resources did not materialize in 1975.
Due to weakening external demand, phosphate exports decreased to 13.1 million
tons, from 18.7 million tons in 1974, and prices began to drop sharply in the
second half of 1975, restraining correspondingly the country's real capacity
to save and to import. Unfavorable weather resulted in poor crops in 1973
and in 1975 and to meet domestic demand, food imports were increased substan-
tially. In constant prices, value added by the mining and agricultural
sectors returned in 1975 to levels slightly below those of 1972 despite the
fast growth of other industry and services and this held back real GDP growth
to about 4 percent per year in 1973-75. As a result largely of the disappoint-
ing performance of phosphate exports in 1975, Morocco's internal and external
finances came under pressure. The Treasury's accounts showed in 1975 an
overall deficit twice the 1974 level due mainly to sharply rising capital
spending and insufficient growth in budgetary savings. This contributed to
inflationary pressure domestically; the cost of living index rose by nearly
8 percent in 1975. The current account of the balance of payments, which had
shown a surplus of $105 million in 1973 and $237 million in 1974, registered
a deficit of $546 million in 1975.
10.       In 1976, GDP growth accelerated to 10 percent, thanks partly to a
good cereal harvest (48 percent larger than the previous year's) and a gradual
recovery of phosphate sales abroad, and partly to the continued growth momen-
tum in manufacturing, construction and services. The expansionary investment
policies of 1973-75 continued, and the 1976 Budget Law raised further the
allocations for investments in the public and semi-public sectors. Several
measures were, however, taken to curb the growth of consumption demand, in-
cluding some restraint in current budgetary spending, the successful placement
last summer of a DH I billion ($230 million) bond issue among the Moroccan
public, and the introduction of credit restraints. These measures were in-
troduced under a financial program which Morocco adopted in February 1976
in support of purchases from the International Monetary Fund in the first
credit tranche and under the 1975 oil facility. Nevertheless, for the full



- 4 -
year, imports registered another sizeable increase, not matched by the recovery
of export receipts, and the balance of payments current account registered a
deficit estimated at $1.2 billion compared to about $0.5 billion in 1975.
There was however little change in the country's net foreign assets, as the
deficit was covered by large increases in worker's remittances from abroad,
and in net external capital inflows. Regarding the latter, Morocco has drawn
on IMF facilities for a total amount of $165 million in early 1976, and it
has considerably stepped up borrowings from Arab and commercial sources (see
Attachment 1, page 3). An important factor in economic and financial devel-
opments in 1976 were Morocco's commitments and defense expenditures in the
Sahara province and their impact on Government expenditures, imports and
external capital inflows. While detailed information is lacking, it appears
that substantially higher Government spending and imports for military and
developmental purposes were nearly offset by increased grant inflows from
external sources.
11.       For 1977, the Government intends to further curb the trends in con-
sumption demand, particularly for imported consumer goods, and restrain sig-
nificantly investment in the public and semi-public sectors, in order to keep
developments in the internal and external financial situation under firm
control. Measures to this effect have been taken. While 1977 would be a year
of retrenchment by comparison with policies during the first four years of the
1973-77 Plan, the overall performance of the economy would be satisfactory for
the Plan period as a whole. Staff estimates show that a rapid growth (between
16 and 17 percent a year) of investment would have been achieved, exceeding
the original Plan targets for 1973-77. They also show relatively good gains
in GDP (about 6 percent a year) and consumption (close to 3 percent a year per
capita), despite the rather disappointing developments in real terms for the
phosphate and agricultural sectors. Finally, national savings would have
financed a larger share of 1973-77 investments than anticipated originally.
A detailed performance review of the economy during 1973-77 will be under-
taken by the Bank late next fiscal year, in conjunction with an assessment
of Morocco's next five-year Plan (1978-82).
Development Prospects
12.       The Plan revisions that were introduced on the occasion of the 1975
and 1976 Budget Laws, have maintained or strengthened the investment programs
designed to achieve the original economic and social objectives of the 1973-77
Plan. They have, in addition, greatly increased allocations for regional
development, for low-cost housing, and especially for the launching of three
industrial investment programs to be implemented over the next decade. These
programs are a one-million ton steel mill and related infrastructure at Nador,
a series of sugar mills and related irrigation development and several chemical
and petrochemical export units based partly on phosphate. Thus, the Plan
revisions will have an important spill-over effect on the next 1978-82 Plan.
13.       The general thrust of the Plan revisions seems justified.    Indeed,
the achievement of initial (especially social) Plan objectives is eminently
desirable. Similarly, Morocco's economy has developed to a stage where some



- 5 -
basic industries may find a justified place. The country in particular
possesses an obvious comparative advantage in the processing of phosphates,
which would tend to stabilize export earnings. Similarly, it can produce at
competitive cost the sugar which it would otherwise import. However, the Plan
revisions raise several issues of importance for Morocco's long-term develop-
ment strategy and prospects.
14.       The investment level is now very close to the country's absorptive
capacity, following the noted increases in 1973-76. Although training efforts
have been stepped up, it is likely that shortages of skilled and experienced
manpower will continue to be a problem for some years to come. While for
large industrial and infrastructure projects, Morocco can use foreign services
extensively, this is costly and would not be a suitable solution to meeting
the needs of smaller investments in large numbers. Further investments in
steel and chemical industries will generate comparatively little employment
opportunities for unskilled workers.
15.       In addition, financial constraints may in future again restrain
Morocco's overall development efforts. While there is scope for increasing
phosphate exports in the medium term, prospects are that the real price of
phosphate will remain at best stable. Since phosphate export receipts are
a major factor for Morocco's real capacity to save and import, such capacity
would be restrained. Taking into account the objective and policies to improve
consumption levels of low-income groups, national savings may be expected to be
restrained on this account also. In spite of likely efforts to increase bud-
getary savings and import substitution (particularly food), foreign exchange
and national savings are likely to be constraints on investment during the next
Plan period.
16.       For the 1978-82 Plan period, absorptive capacity and especially
resource availability therefore call for caution. Bank projections which are
preliminary since the Government has not yet fixed the 1978-82 Plan's objec-
tives and strategy indicate that gross fixed investment could only grow
slowly in view of these constraints. Given the planned move into heavy
industries, investment possibilities in other sectors would by necessity be
limited. Assuming a real investment growth rate of about 3 percent per year
and export growth of about 8 percent, which seems feasible in view of market
prospects and cxport capacity, a GDP growth rate averaging about 6.1 percent
yearly during the 1978-82 period would be likely. Despite implementation of
policies to restrain consumer goods imports and likely import substitution,
Morocco would experience a sizeable resource gap, and need relatively large
inflows of external capital to cover it and to service accumulated debt.
External borrowing requirements on a commitment basis are tentatively pro-
jected to average $900 million per year in 1978-82, about two-thirds of which
would be met by official multilateral and bilateral sources and the rest by
commercial sources. Morocco has successfully increased external borrowings in
1974-76; loan commitments have risen to $550 million in 1974, $860 million in
1975 and $1.8 billion in 1976. Morocco should, therefore, be able to mobilize
the amounts projected for 1978-82.
17.       External debt and debt service would increase as a result of pro-
jected borrowings. Debt outstanding and disbursed, which was $1.1 billion at
the end of 1974 and an estimated $1.5 billion (19 percent of GDP) at the end



- 6-
of 1975 would rise to a projected $5.0 billion (or 24 percent of GDP) by the
end of 1982. Similarly, debt service payments would rise from the low 8.3
percent of exports in 1975 to a maximum of about 18 percent in 1982. Adding
workers' remittances to exports, the debt service ratio was less than 7 per-
cent in 1975 and would rise to 15 percent in 1982. These projected levels
for debt and debt service would be high, but still within Morocco's debt
carrying capacity, especially when considering the country's improved eco-
nomic and social policies and its long-term export prospects, not only in
phosphate rock and related products, but also in agricultural and industrial
commodities for the European market. Beyond 1982, the relative burden of debt
would probably tend to decline gradually as the economy's external resource
gap would tend to diminish. Therefore Morocco is considered creditworthy for
Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
18.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 29 projects, financing
a total of $704.5 million (net of cancellations), of which $489.5 million has
been lent since the beginning of FY73. IDA credits, totalling $50.0 million,
have been made available for five projects. A Third Window loan for $25 mil-
lion for the third education project was approved in March 1976. IFC invest-
ments have amounted to $4.2 million. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of January 31, 1977, and
notes on the execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases, delays
have been caused by management or procurement difficulties, and in 1974 cost
overruns increased due to the upsurge in investment activity in Morocco and
the acceleration of inflation. However, performance in project execution has
considerably improved during the last two years.
19.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the industrial and
agricultural sectors, which together have accounted for 61 percent of total
net commitments; the balance is accounted for by utilities (18 percent),
tourism (10 percent), roads (6 percent) and education (5 percent). Apart from
the transfer of resources to Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted
to 5.5 percent of total fixed investment in 1970-74), the main objectives of
lending were to foster and strengthen development institutions, provide tech-
nical assistance, particularly for project preparation, and increase produc-
tive capacity, particularly in order to improve the balance of pay,, nts.
20.       While these objectives remain, emphasis is also being given to
supporting the Government's development effort in income distribution. An
increasing share of Bank Group lending will be devoted to projects directly
or indirectly developing the productive capacity of the lowest urban and rural
income groups.
21.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development,
credit and, through a first operation in FY75, the improvement of the produc-
tivity of rainfed farming. While continued lending for irrigation is envisaged,



greater emphasis will be given to supporting the improvement of rainfed farm-
ing, and lending will in general be focussed on support to small farmers. A
third agricultural project was recently approved. Projects for livestock/
rural development in the rainfed zones in northern Morocco, for developing
production of fruits and vegetables on small holdings and for promoting in-
tegrated rural development in selected regions of Morocco are being prepared.
22.       Projects in industry and tourism have as key objectives increased
foreign exchange earnings or savings and the improvement of sectoral policies.
In addition, the presently proposed project would contribute to correct the
present regional economic disparities. Continued lending for industry and
tourism through two DFC's (Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique-
BNDE and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier-CIH) will be proposed. Proposals for
industrial lending, including one for a steel mill in northeast Morocco, are
under consideration.
23.       A slum upgrading project in Rabat is being prepared, which should
contribute to devising means for solving the problem of rapid growth of slum
areas. A substantial social services component and an employment generation
program are envisaged.
24.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.
Two IDA credits have been made to develop secondary education and teacher
training and to improve technical and vocational training. A third project,
with emphasis on improving facilities in rural areas, was recently approved
by the Executive Directors. A fourth project with emphasis on technical
and vocational training is under preparation.
25.       Loan commitments from multilateral and bilateral official sources to
Morocco rose from $92 million in 1973 to $425 million in 1974 and $538 million
in 1975. In addition Morocco received grants totalling $40 million in 1973
and $42 million in 1974. The major sources of aid were France, Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, the U.S., Germany and the Bank Group. At the end of 1976, the Bank
Group's share in Morocco's outstanding and disbursed external public debt was
estimated at 13 percent. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was 20
percent in 1975 and an estimated 13 percent in 1976. By 1982 the Bank Group's
shares in debt outstanding and in debt service are expected to be about 17
percent and 11 percent respectively, on the basis of the assumptions made for
total external borrowings for the 1976-82 period (see para 17).
PART III - INDUSTRY IN MOROCCO
26.       Manufacturing industry accounts for about 15 percent of GDP in
Morocco. After stagnating in the mid-1960's, manufacturing output grew more
rapidly during the Second Plan period (5.4 percent per year between 1968 and
1972) and during the first three years of the Third Plan (9.8 percent in 1973,
5.4 percent in 1974, and 6.2 percent in 1975). Output of the sector is geared
mainly to meeting demand for consumer and basic construction goods, and growth
since 1966 has been led by the food processing, motor vehicle assembly, textile



- 8 -
and leather goods and construction goods subsectors. In general, manufacturing
production benefits from substantial tariff and transport protection from
foreign competition and is directed to meeting domestic demand. However, the
growth of manufactured exports, based predominantly on domestic raw materials
produced by agriculture and mining, has been rapid, averaging 19 percent from
1966 to 1975. Export incentives, including income tax exemption, and alloca-
tion of foreign exchange for export production purposes, were introduced in
August 1973. With notable exceptions in cement and pulp and paper manufacture
and motor vehicle assembly, the sector has been characterized by a rather low
degree of capacity utilization, particularly in food processing.
27.       Investment in manufacturing totalled about DH 1.9 billion ($380
million) during the Second Plan period. Private sector investment, which
accounted for about three-quarters of this total, grew rapidly from 1968 to
1970, but stagnated in 1971 and 1972 when private investors seemed to take a
wait-and-see attitude, in view of the political situation, and in the expec-
tation of new measures concerning Moroccanization and investment incentives.
With stabilization of the political situation, successful implementation of
Moroccanization and publication of a new Investment Code in 1973, private
investment increased very sharply in 1974 and 1975. On the basis of commit-
ments by the National Bank for Economic Development (BNDE), the level of
private sector investment in 1976 appeared to stabilize. The Investment
Code of August 1973 provides exemptions from import duties, indirect taxes
on equipment purchases, and income tax for 10 years, guarantees to foreign
investors regarding dividend and capital repatriation, and a 2 percent subsidy
on interest payments on BNDE long-term loans. Benefits are granted automatic-
ally in some sectors for investments less than DH 30 million. For large scale
investments, benefits are granted on a case-by-case basis.
28.       Recorded employment in manufacturing grew from 255,000 in 1960 to
366,000 in 1971, an average growth of 3.3 percent, slightly slower than the
growth of output. On the basis of data gathered by BNDE, investment per job
created in manufacturing - excluding small-scale activity which tends to be
more labor-intensive - is of the order of $20,000. An important step in
encouraging employment in manufacturing was made through the 1973 Investment
Code; its incentives are less biased in favor of capital (investment grants
have been eliminated) and favor less-developed regions (for example, the
tax holiday does not apply to Casablanca). The Government is placing in-
creasing emphasis on small-scale industry as a source of employment, and has
requested Bank assistance in this field.
29.       The Government establishes the policy framework for the development
of manufacturing through its Ministry of Industry, acting in coordination with
the Ministries of Finance and Plan and with the Prime Minister's Office. It
has also participated directly in manufacturing activity. The Cherifian
Phosphate Office (OCP) is responsible for mining, processing and export of
phosphates and derivatives, which have been reserved to the public sector
because of its importance to the economy. The Industrial Development Office
(ODI) is responsible to the Minister of Industry for direct industrial promo-
tion activities. ODI undertakes pre-investment studies, acquires equity shares



- 9 -
in new industrial enterprises, and aims at contributing to regional development
and local participation in manufacturing. Few of the projects promoted by ODI
since its establishment in 1973 have yet come into production, and many are
still under construction, including the CIOR project.     So far ODI has been
fully dependent on the Treasury for its financial resources.
Cement Production in Morocco.
30.       Apparent cement demand (as opposed to potential demand if supply
restrictions were lifted) in Morocco has grown rapidly since 1960, averaging
9.8 percent per year. Growth in demand was particularly rapid between 1967
and 1976 (14.5 percent per year), reflecting the rapid growth of the economy
and investment activity in the late 1960's and the last two years. Consump-
tion growth is estimated at 30 percent in 1976, and is expected to average
about 11.5 percent per year for the next few years, before tapering off to
about 7 percent. On this basis, demand would reach about 4.5 million tons
a year by 1980, compared to 2.2 million tons in 1975.
31.       There are at present six cement plants in Morocco, all but one of
which were originally foreign owned and built before Independence (1956). They
have since been gradually transferred to majority Moroccan ownership. Cement
production has grown rapidly in response to demand, through improved capacity
utilization and through expansion of existing capacities. However, production
did not keep pace with apparent demand in 1971-73 and 1975, making cement im-
ports necessary in those years. Production is estimated at 2.2 million tons
in 1976, close to full capacity, and imports in the same year amounted to
about 740,000 tons.
32.       To respond to the growth in demand up to 1980, extensions of most
existing plants and construction of two new plants are planned. A new plant
at Marrakech, of a capacity of 500,000 tons per year (tpy) in which IFC holds
a participation, and small expansions of existing plants at Tetouan and Agadir
came into production in 1976. Start-up of the CIOR project is expected to
take place in the third quarter of 1978. Expansion of other existing plants
and construction of a 600,000 tpy capacity plant in the Rabat area are in the
planning stage. Depending on the realization of these plans, production capac-
ity should be about 4.2 million tons in 1980, very close to projected demand.
To enhance their investment planning capabilities in the sector, the Moroccan
authorities are planning to carry out in the next two years a detailed national
study on demand for cement, followed by a national distribution study to be
carried out with the assistance of consultants. The Moroccan Government would
also exchange views with the Bank on cement market projections before under-
taking any significant new expansion of cement production capacity (draft
Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.07). Since much of the proposed capacity
increase would come from expansion projects which require relatively short
lead-time, the timing of the investments could be adjusted in response to the
actual evolution of the demand-supply situation, and any significant imbalance
can be controlled.

33.       Cement prices are determined by the Government at the producer level.
Prices have been fixed on an individual plant basis, taking into account the
characteristics of each plant and its natural regional market. Ex-factory
prices were virtually frozen from 1958 until 1975, and, as a result, were
substantially below the levels in other countries by 1975. At the beginning
of 1975 ex-factory prices ranged from DH 98 (US$23.3) per ton in Casablanca to
DH 123 (US$29) per ton in Agadir. When cement imports of about 200,000 tons
became necessary in the same year, the Government subsidized cement imports to
bring their prices into line with those of domestic producers. However, as a
result of an increasingly keen demand for cement, the benefits of controlled
producer prices and subsidized imports have not been passed on to consumers,
but have rather led to increased wholesalers' markups. In May 1975, the
Government increased the ex-factory prices for the Casablanca and Meknes
plants by DR 10 and DH 8 per ton respectively, at the same time levying a tax
in the same amount, which is used to defray part of the cost of import subsi-
dies through a "caisse de compensation". The Government also introduced
controls on wholesale and retail margins, limiting agents' profits to 3-6
percent of sales. After two further adjustments, ex-factory cement prices in
1976 averaged DH 148/ton (US$33) and stood at a level adequate for the next
two or three years.
34.       The Moroccan authorities intend to apply pricing policies which
would (i) allow producers to make reasonable profits, thus ensuring that
capacity expansions will be forthcoming to meet demand growth while avoiding
windfall profits for individual producers,(ii) ensure reasonable and rela-
tively stable prices for consumers, (iii) provide an adjustment mechanism for
controlled prices to reflect the impact of inflation on operating costs and,
in the longer run, on capital costs, and (iv) provide incentives for cost-
conscious, efficient operation by not covering automatically the cost of each
producer. The system envisaged would allow the industry as a whole to earn
a return of at least 10 percent on total net fixed assets in operation as
periodically revalued, and based on efficient operations. Prices will con-
tinue to take into account transport costs and market conditions, and would be
adjusted to reflect actual changes in unit costs of major inputs such as fuel
and labor. While the Government may grant import, investment, transport and
distribution incentives and subsidies, these would be financed by levies on
the industry so that the system would operate without net subsidization. The
operating mechanisms of the system would be determined in a study which the
Government will undertake by end 1977 with the assistance of consultants and
in consultation with the Bank.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
35.       Originally conceived as a joint Algerian/Moroccan venture, the
project was scheduled for presentation to the Board in March 1975, when
exceptional circumstances delayed its consideration by over one year.
As a result, the project now presented is in an advanced stage of imple-
mentation.



- 11 -
36.       In July 1972, the Algerian and Moroccan Governments signed an
agreement providing for the establishment of Cimenterie Maghrebine (CIMA),
a Moroccan-registered private joint-stock company, to establish, own and
operate a cement plant in eastern Morocco. Ownership and production of the
company were to be evenly split between Algeria and Morocco with the state-
owned Algerian National Construction Materials Company (SNMC) and ODI (at
that time known as the Office for Industrial Studies and Investment, BEPI) as
shareholders. The company was registered in December, 1972, and its by-laws
adopted at a General Shareholders' Meeting.
37.       In late 1973, following initial contacts between CIMA and the Bank,
CIMA requested Bank assistance in monitoring preparation and in financing
the project. The Arab Fund was also approached. The project was appraised
between March and December 1975, construction started on the site and in-
vitations to carry out preliminary negotiations were extended to all parties
concerned in February 1976. Political differences between the two countries
prevented the discussions from taking place, and cooperation on the proposed
cement plant between Morocco and Algeria came to a halt.
38.       On the grounds of CIMA's inability to operate, in view of its im-
pending insolvency, and after several initiatives to initiate joint action
between the two sponsoring countries to remedy the company's situation,
Moroccan courts designated a temporary administrator for CIMA. A new company,
CIOR, was then created with ODI as its sole shareholder to pursue the project.
CIOR set out to substitute itself for CIMA in all contracts previously entered
into by the latter, and CIMA was compensated with two bank guarantees payable
on its request and adding up to the company's paid-in capital minus cash
on hand. The legal arrangements by which the substitution took place were
reviewed within the Bank and found satisfactory. Project implementation
subsequently proceeded on schedule and no contractual penalty was incurred.
39.       By averting bankruptcy for CIMA, the cov,rse chosen preserves the
stakes of both partners in the company. If SNMC wishes to withdraw its f nds,
Moroccan exchange legislation allows foreign investments to be repatriated in
full in convertible currencies. The Government has further indicated that the
Algerian partner could resume its active participation in the project if so
desired. An independent legal opinion from Morocco was obtained confirming
that the steps taken comply with Moroccan legislation. The legal opinion also
confirms that Moroccan legislation authorizes the free convertibility and
transfer of foreign capital such as SNMC's contribution, and that such legis-
lation cannot be changed with retroactive effect. These and other issues
raised by the project's new arrangements were reviewed with a Moroccan delega-
tion in the course of discussions held in October 1976, and a final appraisal
mission took place in November. Negotiations were held in Washington in
February 1977. The Moroccan delegation was led by Mr. Benjelloun, General
Manager of ODI and President of CIOR. A loan and project summary is shown
in Annex III. The Appraisal Report, No. 1426-MOR of March 4, 1977 is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.



- 12 -
Objectives and Description
40.       The project aims at (i) satisfying the growing demand for cement in
Morocco through local production, and (ii) assisting in the development of the
Eastern Province, one of the less-developed regions in Morocco. The project
consists of the construction and start-up of a cement plant with a nominal
capacity of 1.2 million tpy of Ordinary Portland cement, located close to El
Aioun, 45 km west of Oujda in the Eastern Province of Morocco (see Map 12528).
Production could be expanded to 1.4 million tpy in 1985 without additional
investment, when slag becomes available for production of blast furnace cement
from a steel mill which is about to be constructed in Nador, at a distance
of 200 km. The project also includes construction of related distribution
facilities and the carrying out of national distribution and pricing studies
(para 34).
41.       The site is particularly well suited for cement production.    The
plant is being constructed adjacent to a large, high quality limestone deposit
located near the surface and sufficient for more than 50 years of operation.
High quality clay is available about 7 km from the plant, and gypsum will be
purchased from an existing quarry about 45 km away. No special additives are
required, except for the limited production of special cements. Production
would be by the dry process, and the limited water requirements will be met
from groundwater sources. The main east-west road runs past the plant site.
Spur lines have been constructed under the project to link the plant with the
main east-west electricity transmission and railway lines, both of which pass
within two kilometers of the plant. The plant would burn heavy fuel oil from
local refineries. The plant will be based on two medium-sized kilns and
mill units. The greater reliability of this design outweighs the additional
economies of scale from a single larger kiln and mill unit.
Project Execution
42.       Apart from the installation of the power connections, execution of
the project is the responsibility of CIOR, with assistance from its British
engineering consultants, Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd. (APCM),
in the preparation of designs and bidding documents, evaluation of bids, con-
tract preparation, training, and supervision of construction, erection and
commissioning. The National Electricity Office constructed, owns and main-
tains the lines and substations connecting the plant to the main power grid.
The National Railway Company (ONCF) constructed, owns and maintains the rail-
way spur line. Procurement began in July 1975, when contracts for equipment
were let. Construction is scheduled to be completed by early 1978; production
start-up is scheduled for the third quarter of 1978, and full capacity opera-
tion for 1981.
43.       CIOR intends to operate the plant with Moroccan personnel and a
small amount of expatriate assistance. Recruitment of staff began in 1974,
and all top management posts have been filled. Satisfactory initial training,
organized by APCM, is under way, and CIOR is to make timely arrangements for
implementation of a program for further training and recruitment (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 4.01 (b)(i)). In addition, since CIOR's staff will have



- 13 -
only limited experience in cement production, there is a need for technical
assistance during the initial phase of plant operation. CIOR would prepare
a detailed technical assistance program for comments by the Bank by September
1977, and would sign a contract for technical assistance satisfactory to the
Bank promptly thereafter (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.01 (b)(iii)).
Distribution
44.       Under the initial arrangements between Algeria and Morocco, the
plant's 1.2 million tpy capacity was to be equally shared between the two
countries. Morocco's share of 600,000 tpy would have been absorbed mostly
in the Oriental region, the company's natural market. In the present circum-
stances, however, Morocco will absorb CIOR's total production, and the company
will have to distribute its product far beyond its natural market area.    A
previously planned expansion of the Meknes cement plant serving a neighboring
market has consequently been postponed.   It is estimated that, in 1982, of the
1.2 million tons produced by CIOR, 550,000 will be distributed in the Oriental
region, and the balance around Fez (310 km from the plant) from a regional dis-
tribution center supplied by rail and managed by CIOR, and in the Casablanca-
Rabat-Kenitra region; all these areas are expected to have matching supply
deficits. In 1985, 680,000 out of 1.2 million tons would be absorbed by the
growing market of the Oriental region, and the balance by the Fez region. In
subsequent years, the demand in CIOR's natural market area would progressively
draw closer to the company's total production level. Detailed transport and
distribution arrangements would be completed by September 1977 under a study
financed from the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02 (a), (b)).
The study would also determine the number and type of railway wagons to be
provided and maintained by the National Railway Company (ONCF) (draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.05). CIOR would conclude a transport contract with ONCF
by April 30, 1978 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(b); draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.05(iii)).
Cost Estimates
45.       Cost estimates are shown in Annex III and are summarized below:
US$ million
Local     Foreign   Total
Base Cost (Plant Fixed Assets)              66.1       79.5     145.6

- 14 -
Physical contingencies are estimated for individual contracts and are in the
range of 5 to 10 percent of base cost, depending on the nature of the con-
tract and its stage of implementation. Price escalation rates of 14 percent
per annum in 1975, 12 percent in 1976 and 8 percent thereafter have been
used for contracts with escalation clauses, except for local components of
preoperating expenses for which uniform rates of 7 percent per year were used.
The capital cost of the plant's fixed assets, excluding related infrastructure,
amounts to $125 per ton of annual installed capacity, which compares favorably
with the average cost of new plants worldwide.
Financing Plan
46.       The base cost of the project, contingencies, and interest during
construction, totalling $182 million would be financed by:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$45 million equivalent for 14
years including 3 years of grace, with total interest cost
to CIOR of 10 percent per annum, including a 1.5 percent
guarantee fee payable to the Moroccan Government;
(b) capital provisions by ODI amounting to the equivalent of
$72.9 million. As $65.1 million have already been sub-
scribed, ODI's additional obligations only amount to $7.8
million (draft Shareholder's Guarantee Agreement, Section
2.03);
(c) Treasury Advances from the Moroccan Government for the
equivalent of US$32.6 million, with expected terms of 17
year maturity, including 3 years of grace, and interest
at 6.5 percent;
(d) a KD 7 million (US$24.5 million equivalent) loan which
the Arab Fund is expected to provide on terms of 17-year
maturity, including 3 years of grace, with interest at
6.5 percent; and
(e) Moroccan commercial bank loans in an amount of about US$7
million equivalent for the financing of working capital.
Interest on the loans is expected to be around 9 percent.
The Moroccan Government has agreed to provide or cause CIOR to be provided
with the funds necessary to carry out the project (draft Guarantee Agreement,
Section 2.02), and the Treasury Advances would be disbursed as the amounts
fall due under existing contracts, unless financing is provided by another
source. The Arab Fund is appraising the project and is expected to provide
its loan within the next few months.
Financial Position of CIOR
47.       The Investment Convention signed between CIOR and the Moroccan
Government, which specifies the advantages to be granted to the company under
the Investment Code (see para. 27) provides that ex-factory cement prices for



- 15 -
CIOR will be set at such a level as to enable the company to achieve a
reasonable return on equity. The financial projections for the project
have been prepared on the assumed basis of a financial rate of return of
10 percent on revalued net fixed assets, which is consistent with the
Government's overall sector pricing objectives (see para. 34). Morocco's
pricing system also compensates automatically for transportation cost.
To preserve a strong financial position, CIOR would (i) maintain a current
ratio of at least 1.3 at all times, (ii) have to obtain prior Bank consent to
undertake any capital investments in excess of $5 million a year until project
completion, and (iii) not pay any dividend or make any other distribution of
cash not needed for operations unless after such payments a current ratio of
at least 1.5 is maintained (draft Loan Agreement, Sections 5.07, 5.08). In
addition, to ensure timely payment of equity contributions during project
construction and maintain CIOR's long-term financial position, CIOR would
maintain a debt:equity ratio of not more than 60:40 and a debt service cover-
age of at least 1.5 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.05). ODI would ensure
that CIOR has at all times the financial resources needed to meet these
requirements,promptly complete the project and meet cost overruns if necessary
(draft Shareholder's Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03). On the basis of the
cost estimates and financing plan presented in paragraphs 45 and 46, CIOR
should have no difficulty in complying with the above provisions.
Accounts
48.       In order to monitor its productivity and costs CIOR will require a
sound accounting and financial planning system. A chief accountant has been
trained under APCM's training program. In addition, CIOR would employ by
June 1977 consultant accountants, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, to set up accounting and cost control systems (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.01(b)(ii)). The foreign exchange cost of these accountants would
be financed through the proposed Bank loan.
Procurement
49.       Procurement of civil works, equipment and services for the cement
plant itself has been carried out through International Competitive Bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, regardless of
sources of financing. For the purposes of bid evaluation, Moroccan domestic
equipment suppliers were given a margin of preference equal to 15 percent or
the prevailing import duty, whichever was lower. In July 1975, CIMA signed
four fixed price contracts with Polysius (France), after international com-
petitive bidding in which Polysius was the lowest evaluated bidder, for
the supply of the mechanical equipment, for its erection and commissioning,
supply of appropriate spare parts and related training. A contract for site
preparation was signed in September 1975 with CTRA - ENATRA, a Moroccan civil
works contractor, following international competitive bidding, while the
civil works contract for buildings and foundations was awarded to Construcos
Technicos (Portugal) in May 1976. The remaining contracts - for the remaining
equipment items, and for inspection of equipment - were let between November
1975 and July 1976, with the exception of equipment for the distribution
facilities which are still in the planning stage (see para. 44).



- 16 -
50.       Consultant services for project engineering, construction super-
vision, training and start-up, are being provided by APCM and financed from
local funds. Consultant services for setting up the accounting system (para.
48) and for CIOR's distribution study would be contracted in accordance with
the Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants' Services. The total cost of con-
sultant services is expected to amount to $5.4 million.
Disbursements on Bank Loan
51.       The Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of the procure-
ment packages recently tendered and part of the foreign exchange cost of the
contracts signed with Polysius (para. 49). Financing of interest during con-
struction on the Bank loan is also proposed, since CIOR is newly established
and the company would have no cash generation of its own during construction
of the project. The amount involved ($2.8 million) is relatively low due to
the nearness of production startup which is less than 18 months away. The
Bank loan, to be disbursed by the end of 1978, would finance:
(i) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of equipment for the
plant and distribution terminals, of training, erection and
commissioning, inspection services, and the accounting con-
sultancy ($24.2 million);
(ii) 47 percent of the total cost of civil works for buildings and
foundations, representing the estimated foreign exchange compo-
nent ($18 million); and
(iii) interest during construction on the Bank loan ($2.8 million).
52.       The breakdown of the original joint-venture has delayed presentation
of this loan to the Executive Directors and greatly increased the financial
burden on the Moroccan sponsors, in view of the project's swift implementation.
As stated in paragraph 49, nearly all important contracts have been let. In
view of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the project, retroactive
financing of up to $5 million for expenditures incurred since April 1, 1976
is proposed (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 4).
Project Risks
53.       The CIOR plant is conservatively designed, its raw material base
has been extensively surveyed and evaluated, and the training and technical
assistance programs will provide the company with adequate skilled personnel;
accordingly CIOR faces only limited technical risks. Similarly, the financial
risks are easy to control, as outlined in paragraph 47. The risks involved
in transporting large quantities of cement over long distances are being care-
fully addressed (para. 44) and are therefore limited, and so are the risks of
an excessive national cement production capacity (para. 33). The risks of
possible judiciary proceedings initiated by CIMA's shareholders adversely
affecting the project are expected to be minimal.



- 17 -
Justification
54.       The project will help in developing Morocco's less-developed Eastern
Province. While the direct employment impact is small (1,200 jobs during
plant construction and 500 during operation), construction of the plant will
improve the availability of cement and will, therefore, help to encourage
labor-intensive housing development and other construction activity.
55.       The country is presently experiencing an acute shortage of domes-
tically produced cement and has had to import about 740,000 tons in 1976
while still not meeting total demand. Major foreign exchange savings would
thus accrue to Morocco under the project. Average net foreign exchange savings
in real terms are about $30 million per year. The overall economic return to
the project is estimated to be 13.8 percent. It rises to 14.7 percent when
the additional 200,000 tpy production of blast furnace cement after 1985 is
taken into account (para. 40), and is reduced to 12.7 percent in the case of a
5 percent capital cost increase, a likely maximum given the advanced stage of
project implementation.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and CIOR, the draft Share-
holders' Guarantee Agreement between ODI and the Bank, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
57.       Features of the Agreements of special interest are described in
paragraphs 32, 43, 44, 46 and 47, 48, 52 of this report.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. No. 643 Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project: US$46 million Loan of November
13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
November 30, 1978.
Progress in implementing the project is now satisfactory although
considerable problems were first experienced with management and procurement,
and some procurement difficulties continue. The major project structure,
Idriss ler Dam, is completed and equipment of 13,200 ha out of a total of
35,000 ha is completed. Another 3,850 ha were commissioned in April 1976.
Project execution was delayed in 1975 due to a shortage, now rectified, of
concrete canalettes. Additional infrastructure for the project area, in-
cluding a sugar cane processing factory and flood protection works, are
being provided by Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Cr. No. 266 Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August 18,
1971; Date of Effectiveness: December 10, 1971;
Closing Date: April 30, 1978.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific
sections of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems, and
technical assistance for project administration and school maintenance.
Subsequently, the Association agreed not to finance two Vocational Training
Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an amount
of about US$0.9 million has been transferred to the unallocated category for
future reallocation and/or cancellation. Initial delays occurred in the
appointment of consultant architects, in the recruitment of local personnel
and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit and in procurement.
However, execution is now proceeding satisfactorily. Physical execution of
the project is forecast for completion by the end of 1976, about one year
and a half later than originally planned.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 6 pages
Ln. No. 848 Second Hotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 1, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Commitments and disbursements initially lagged behind expectations,
due to sluggish investment activity in 1973, but the loan is now fully com-
mitted, as against the appraisal estimate of Mlarch 1974. The loan is now
expected to be fully disbursed by mid 1977.
Ln. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness:   May 2, 1973; Closing Date:   December 31,
1977.
The dam which was the major component of the project was inaugurated
in August 1974. All project elements are being completed on schedule except
for the treatment plant and the training school, which are both about six
months behind schedule. The financial position of the Borrower, Office
National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP), is satisfactory. In early 1976 consultants
have completed a tariff study which will assist in improving ONEP's long-term
financial performance. Consultants have recently been engaged to undertake a
management study for ONEP.
Ln. No. 890 Sixth BNDE Project; US$24 million of May 14, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: September 10, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
The loan was fully committed by May 1974, about six months earlier
than expected, due to rapid improvement of the investment climate since mid-
1973. Disbursements should be completed by March 1977.
Ln. No. 936 Power Project; US$25 million of October 5, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: January 23, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Physical implementation of the project is practically complete.
Savings amounting to about US$4.0 million are being applied to consultant
services for feasibility studies, preliminary design and preparation of bid
documents for 5 hydro stations required to alleviate Morocco's dependency on
imported oil. Although electricity rates were sharply increased on January 1,
1976, ONE's rate of return has not yet reached the covenanted level because
of even sharper increases in the price of imported inputs.
Ln. No. 955 Second Highway Project; US$29 million of January 11, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: May 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction of the Rabat-Casablanca expressway began in early 1975,
8 months behind schedule and is expected to be completed during the first half
of 1977. Purchase of maintenance equipment and work on the highway improvement
program are proceeding satisfactorily, close to the appraisal cost estimates.
The consultants for the urban traffic and transport study in the towns of
Casablanca and Rabat have submitted the draft final reports. The Government
has recently awarded a contract for technical assistance for the establishment
of a Transport Planning Office in the Ministry of Public Works and consultants
have commenced work in August 1976.

Ln. No. 1017 Phosphoric Acid Project; US$50.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
June 39, 1977.
Progress in project execution is good, although there is likely to
be a minor delay in plant start-up, due to a delay in the civil works component
of the turnkey contract. Personnel recruitment and training is well underway.
Cost overrun is expected to be less than 8 percent, mostly in local currency
and will be financed locally.
Ln. No. 1018 Sebou II Development Project; US$32.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 28, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The sugar cane processing factory was commissioned in June, 1975,
one month later than originally scheduled, but in time to process the 1975
harvest. Construction of the project area roads is on schedule but work on
the flood protection dykes is about nine months behind schedule, mainly on
account of delays in land acquisition. The studies of pollution control and
the incidence of bilharzia on the Rharb plain have not yet been started.
Ln. No. 1061 Seventh BNDE Project; US$30 million of December 30, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
This loan is practically fully committed. Disbursements are roughly
in line with appraisal estimates.
Ln. No. 1123 Souss Groundwater Project; US$18.5 million of June 11, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
Project execution is on schedule. The project unit has been created,
its staff appointed, and the project co-ordinating committee has been estab-
lished.
Cr. No. 555 Meknes Agricultural Development Project; US$14.0 million of
June 11, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: November 14, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
Following initial delay, the project is now getting underway. How-
ever, project management and the coordination of project activities between
the project authority and the central offices of the Ministry of Agriculture
require close monitoring for satisfactory enforcement of land distribution
criteria.

Ln. No. 1201 Doukkala Irrigation Project; US$30.0 million of February 27,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 20, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981.
The project includes sprinkler irrigation for 15,400 ha and infra-
structure and equipment. Progress of construction is satisfactory with the
exception of laying and testing of large diameter concrete pipes.
Ln. No. 1202 Bay of Agadir Tourism Project; US$21.0 million of February 27,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: October 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project intended to develop Agadir into a major tourism area
consists of infrastructure works and public facilities for the development
of a new tourism section on 260 ha on which 7,000 hotel beds and 2,600
housing units are expected to be constructed. The project includes also
regional infrastructure and facilities for the development of Agadir's tour-
ism assets. Lengthy administrative procedures have delayed fulfilment of
special conditions of effectiveness such as the enactment of a development
plan for the project zone and of expropriation decrees. Otherwise project
implementation is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1220 Third Education Project; US$25.0 million of March 18, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: October 1, 1976; Closing Date:
May 1, 1981.
The project is designed to expand and improve primary and secondary
education in rural areas and specialized training to meet urgent manpower
needs in education, agriculture, health and tourism. Progress implementation
is progressing satisfactorily. The ministries concerned have appointed the
officials responsible for project implementation. Consultant architects
have been selected. Selection and acquisition of site are well underway.
Ln. No. 1279 Third Hotel Development Project; US$25.0 million of July 2,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: November 18, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Implementation of the project is proceeding well. The Loan is
expected to be disbursed somewhat ahead of schedule. Commitments at end
1976 amounted to $4.2 million. CIH has been successful in mobilizing for-
eign exchange resources other than the Bank's and in reducing outstanding
arrears in accordance with understandings reached during negotiations.
