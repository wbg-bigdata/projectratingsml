'PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO: CIOR CEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1383-MOR)
PREFACE
This report covers the CIOR cement project supported by Loan 1383-MOR.
The loan of US$45.0 million was approved in March 1977 and became effective four
months after the approval. The loan amount was fully disbursed by the fourth
quarter of FY 1982, almost three years behind schedule. However, 93% of the
loan was disbursed within the appraisal estimated disbursement period.
The project under review consisted of the design, construction and
commissioning of a cement plant with a nominal capacity of 1.2 million tpy of
cement, including off-site infrastructure, and of distribution facilities re-
quired for the marketing of the plant products. The project also included the
training of personnel to operate the plant, the establishment of management
systems for the plant, and a study of the Moroccan cement pricing and distrib-
ution system. The Bank loan of US$45 million financed civil works (US$17.5
million) equipment and services (US$24.7 million), and interest during construc-
tion (US$2.8 million).
The loan was made to Cimenterie de l'Oriental (CIOR), a company set up
for the project and originally owned entirely by the public Office pour le
Developpement Industriel (ODI). During project implementation, 18% of CIOR's
share capital was sold to the Islamic Development Bank.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Industry
Department of the Bank, on the basis of information and data supplied by and
discussed with CIOR during the two completion missions which visited the project.
Comments on the draft report, received from the Regional Department of the Bank
and from the Borrower have been taken into account in finalizing the report.
Comments received from ODI are attached as Annex 1.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO: CIOR CEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1383)
HIGHLIGHTS
Implementation of the project has been generally satisfactory. The
project was completed about 10 months behind schedule, with a slight cost over-
run (0.1% in DH terms; 12.6% in US$ terms). The main reasons for the imple-
mentation delay were (i) delays by the main equipment supplier in manufacturing
and delivery of equipment and in providing sufficient qualified staff during
erection, (ii) lack of familiarity of the civil works contractor with country
condition, and (iii) the project location in a remote area. Although the delays
in civil works resulted in higher costs, overall financing requirements were
hardly affected due to underruns for mechanical equipment and working capital.
Regarding project financing, the major difference from the original plan was
the inability of the Government to provide all treasury advances that had been
committed for about one third of funding requirements. These funds have been
compensated, without causing major problems for project implementation, by loans
from other sources and cash generation, as part of the project costs were in-
curred after start-up of operations. The competent and stable management of
CIOR has been a key to the success of the project. Technical assistance arrange-
ments during construction and start-up of operations have been adequate and the
association of local and foreign consulting firms in two instances proved to
be a success.
Operations of the project have so far been satisfactory although
somewhat below expectations. Considering the delay in production start-up of
8 months, due to the longer construction period, the production build-up in
the first 3 years of operations has been below the appraisal estimate, because
of market constraints and minor technical problems. Operating costs have been
substantially higher than foreseen, mostly as a result of unexpected high in-
creases in the unit costs of the energy inputs (fuel oil and electricity). To
reduce the high and rising cost of energy, CIOR is considering the conversion
of the CIOR plant from fuel oil firing to coal firing which conversion would
have an attractive economic rate of return. As a result of delayed start-up
of the project, CIOR's financial performance has been disappointing with sub-
stantial losses in 1979 and 1980 and a modest profit in 1981. However, CIOR's
financial position is expected to improve following the recent increases of
cement prices, the establishment of a new cement pricing and distribution
system by the Government, and by reducing CIOR's costs of energy consumption
by converting its plant from fuel oil firing to coal firing. As a result, the
project is now expected to achieve a satisfactory financial rate of return of
10.7%. The economic rate of return is presently estimated at 11.5%.
The Bank played an important role in assisting CIOR and the Moroccan
authorities in adequate preparation and implementation of the project. Partic-
ularly in defining the project scope, in establishing the financing plan, in
defining technical assistance arrangements for the project, and in clearly
establishing procurement guidelines. The Bank's involvement also had a
positive effect on the cement sector, particularly through the dialogue with the
Government on cement pricing and distribution, following a study on this sub-
ject financed by the Bank loan. This has been instrumental in the setting
of more realistic cement prices in Morocco since the mid-1970's, and in the



(iv)
establishment of a pricing and distribution system in early 1982 which
is an important step toward the liberalization of the cement market in
Morocco and which provides incentives for efficient cement producers.
Several lessons can be drawn from the project:
-   Quality, stability and personality of top management
are of paramount importance for the success of a project;
-   Consultants, suppliers and contractors should not under-
estimate the difficulties resulting from the remote location
of a project and its effect on the implementation schedule;
-   Major sector issues (such as pricing and distribution in
the project's case) should be identified early in the
project cycle and be addressed continually during project
preparation and execution, and Government actions on these
issues where possible, be made conditions of the Bank loan;
-   Short and medium term market projections at project appraisal,
which deviate from long term projects that are normally
prepared at appraisal should be given more attention, in
order to provide more precautions against adverse economic
conditions.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO: CIOR CEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1383-MOR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The CIOR cement project was one of the main industrial projects
included in the Moroccan 1973-77 Five Year Plan, and its objectives were (i)
import substitution by satisfying the growing domestic cement demand by local
production, and (ii) development of the Oriental Region, one of the lesser
developed areas of Morocco. The project, which was implemented during 1976-
79, consisted of the construction of a 1.2 million tpy cement plant near
Oujda in the Oriental Region in Northeast Morrocco, and a 500,000 tpy distri-
bution center in Fes in the Central Region to facilitate cement distribution
of the plant in that region and Western Morocco. Oujda was chosen as the
plant location because of the availability of raw materials (limestone and
clay), and its proximity to Algeria, which was to participate in the project.
1.02     Originally, in 1972, the project was started as a joint venture
between Morocco and Algeria and it was the intention that half of the plant's
production would be shipped to Algeria. When the cooperation between Algeria
and Morocco came to a halt in 1976, the Moroccan authorities created
Cimenterie de L'Oriental (CIOR) to take over project implementation. After
analyzing the options (i) original project scope, (ii) reduced scope, and
(iii) liquidation, it was then decided to carry out the project scope as
originally planned, with Morocco fully responsible for project financing,
and with the construction of an additional distribution center near Fes to
sell production in excess of demand in the Oriental Region. Compared to the
other options, the advantages were: (i) no delay in project implementation,
(ii) use of sunk cost already incurred, and avoiding penalties of about
US$20 million in cancelling existing contracts, and (iii) possibility of
eventually allowing Algeria to re-enter the joint venture.
1.03      Due to the above developments, project preparation by the Bank took
longer than expected. After a project preparation mission in August 1974, the
project was originally appraised in March 1975, after which Algeria withdrew
from the project. The project was re-appraised in November 1976 when the
ownership of CIOR had been settled. The US$45.0 million Bank loan, which
financed civil works, equipment, consulting services and interest during
construction, was approved in March 1977 and became effective in July 1977.
Five supervision missions and two completion missions visited the project
during 1977-81.
II. CIOR - THE COMPANY
A. Ownership
2.01      In late 1972 Morocco and Algeria established the Cimenterie Maghre-
bine (CIMA) to implement and operate the project. Half of CIMA-s shares were
owned by the Moroccan Bureau d'Etudes et de Participations Industriels (BEPI),
the predecessor of the Office pour le Developpement Industriel (ODI), and the
other half by the Algerian Societe Nationale des Materiaux de Construction
(SNMC). As mentioned earlier, Morocco created CIOR in 1976, entirely owned by
ODI, to take over project implementation. The project was appraised when
these arrangements were completed. In 1978, 18% of CIOR's share capital



was sold by ODI to the Islamic Development Bank for DH 45 million (US$11.3
million). So far, the Islamic Development Bank has taken the position of a
silent partner and ODI, which owns 82% of CIOR s shares, remains the
Company's major shareholder.
B.    Organization and Management
2.02      CIOR's management structure and organization have performed well.
The President of the Board, who is also the General Director of ODI, is now
Mr. Belkhayat, former assistant to the Prime Minister.     Most of the other
Board members, consisting of representatives from ODI and from the Ministries
of Industry, Finance, Public Works and the Prime Minister-s Office have been
maintained. CIOR s Board exercises the wide powers traditionally exercised by
the Board of a "societe anonyme", e.g. establishment of annual and long term
investment and operational plans; approval of all major contracts, agreements
and loans; appointment of the General Manager; and approval of financial
statements. Mr. Ennadifi, CIOR's General Manager, has kept excellent relations
with the President and with the Board. This has considerably facilitated
project implementation, since in their respective fields, the Board members
have always made their best efforts to support the project.
2.03      Mr. Ennadifi has been a key element in the success of the project.
Open to advice, competent and dynamic, he has managed to attract in a remote
area a well motivated and qualified team, which is now composed of a plant
manager and five directors, respectively for Finance, Marketing, Production,
Administration and the Fes Distribution Terminal. This organizational
structure is adequate.
2.04      As had been agreed during negotiations of the Bank's loan, CIOR
employed outside consultants to study the Company's financial planning and
internal auditing system. The study was carried out by a French engineering
firm and major cement producer, in conjunction with a Moroccan consulting firm
specialized in electronic data processing. The study was of good quality and
its recommendations were implemented in a timely manner.
III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Background and Description
3.01      The project was initiated by the Moroccan authorities as a result of
lack of initiatives from the private sector to build new cement capacity in
Morocco. The private sector had abstained from investing in additional cement
capacity in spite of the growing cement demand in Morocco, because of a long
period of price controls during which prices were frozen at low levels (para
4.10). 1/ The project consisted of the construction of a cement plant at El
Aioun, 45 km west of Oujda in Northeast Morocco, close to the Algerian
1/   Cement prices have been increased more regularly since 1975 (para 4.13).



- 3 -
border. The plant has a nominal capacity of 1.2 million tpy of cement with
two production lines, using energy efficient dry process technology to manufac-
ture ordinary Portland cement as well as some special cement types. Compared
to appraisal, the project scope has undergone only minor changes, the most
important of which are (i) changes in lay-out of conveyor belts, (ii) changes
in position of the raw mill, (iii) addition of a spout packer and weighing
bridges, (iv) addition of a gypsum crusher station and a clinker reclaiming
station, and (v) additional buildings for offices and social services.
Together with the list of production facilities, these changes are presented
in Annex 3-1.
B.    Project Management, Construction and Completion
3.02      The overall project management was carried out by a small team
headed by Mr. Ennadifi, CIOR-s General Manager. The team was assisted by
a British consulting firm which in a first phase prepared the feasibility
study, in cooperation with a local consulting company, and in a second
phase carried out detailed engineering, procurement, training, and supervision
of civil construction, erection and commissioning.
3.03      At appraisal, execution of the Oujda plant project was estimated
to take 37 months from the date of contract signature of mechanical equip-
ment. Completion was scheduled for August 1978, when the second line of
production was planned to start operations following starting of the first
production line 2 months earlier, i.e. in June 1978. This relatively short
execution period was considered realistic since contracts for about 80% of the
project items had already been signed prior to appraisal. Actually, the first
production line started to produce clinker in December 1978, and the second
line in June 1979, respectively 6 and 10 months after the dates estimated
during appraisal. In addition, various finishing works were finalized 3
months after the starting of the second production line. Under these cir-
cumstances, the total project delay was 13 months, with an average composite
of about 10 months 1/. The actual implementation time schedule compared with
the appraisal is given in Annex 3-2 and is summarized below:
1/   Arithmetic average between delays of first production line, second
production line and full completion of the plant.

start-up.
3.04      Within the average composite delay of 10 months, it is estimated
that four months were caused by civil works and six months by the delivery and
erection of equipment. Three main factors contributed to these delays. First,
CIOR alleges that the main equipment contractor was responsible for about 6
months delay in manufacturing and delivering the equipment, and provided
insufficient qualified staff for erection. Second, the civil work contractor,
although technically competent had to familiarize themselves with the Moroccan
environment and procedures. Third, the project was located in a remote area,
making it difficult to attract and maintain local qualified staff for constru-
ction and to obtain supplies in a timely fashion. In particular, there were
periods of shortages for key materials such as cement and steel structures.
3.05      The Fes distribution terminal started operations in July 1979, as
scheduled.
C. Manpower Development, Training and Technical Assistance
3.06      CIOR's total labor force has reached 642 persons, 202 people or
46% more than foreseen during appraisal.    A detailed comparison between



- 5 -
the appraisal estimate and actual employment is shown in Annex 3-3.     The
main reasons for the deviation from the appraisal estimate are (i) the re-
cruitment of 82 persons for the Fes distribution center, 14 persons for the
Marketing Department, 6 persons for the Casablanca distribution center and 6
persons for the Rabat Office, which had all not been included in the appraisal
estimate, (ii) the strengthening of the technical department (73 additional
persons), and of administration (33 additional persons), which according to
CIOR were understaffed in the original plan. As compared to European standards,
the labor force for the Oujda plant seems high. However, the lower productivity
of the Moroccan labor force as compared to European standards has contributed
to this situation.
3.07      CIOR's management has given particular attention to training and
technical assistance, and this has been a major factor in enabling the Company
to rapidly achieve adequate production levels. A training program was carried
out by a British Consulting firm in cooperation with a local firm, and the
equipment suppliers. This program, involving about 70 persons and costing
about US$750,000, has been achieved and was supplemented through training in
other Moroccan cement plants and by internal training within the company.
After project start-up, intensive training of personnel, partly in CIOR's
plant, partly in other Moroccan and foreign plants involved about 120 persons
during 1979 and 1980.
3.08      The preparation, detailed engineering and supervision of execution
and start-up arrangements involved an overall cost of US$7.2 million, and
included about 1,100 manmonths at an average total cost of US$6,100 per manmonth.
These arrangements have been satisfactory. Geological surveys, feasibility
studies, general plant design, procurement, and supervision of construction
and erection have been carried out by a British firm. This firm also assisted
CIOR in overall project coordination and management. Detailed engineering and
supervision of civil works were subcontracted to a British consulting firm,
and market studies for the feasibility study, local recruitment and training
study to a Moroccan consulting firm. A local firm was in charge of housing
construction. Technical assistance arrangements involved a total of about
US$1.0 million, and included about 140 manmonths at an average total cost of
about US$7,100 per manmonth. In conjunction with a French firm, a Moroccan
consulting firm provided assistance for the design and implementation of
accounting, cost control, budgeting and financial planning systems. The
French firm was also selected to carry out the feasibility study, detailed
engineering, supervision of erection and commissioning of the Fes distribution
center and to provide, together with the main suppliers, technical assistance
after project start-up.
3.09      The arrangements for technical assistance during start-up have been
quite exemplary. They have included an agreement between the Oujda plant and
a French Cement producer, involving (i) exchange of information and visits,
(ii) spot assistance in all areas whenever needed, and (iii) availability to
CIOR of the French producers' internal technical, commercial and financial
documentation. Overall, the technical assistance arrangements made by CIOR
for the project have been comprehensive and performed well, and the cooperation
between European and Moroccan consulting firms has been quite successful.

D. Environmental Aspects
3.10      The plant is located in a semi-arid area with little agricultural
use. Nevertheless, it was designed to meet anti-pollution standards comparable
to those maintained by Western European countries.
3.11      Air pollution is the main problem posed by dry process cement plants.
To control pollution, electrostatic precipitators and filters have been
instailed at the various stages of production to keep dust discharges below 115
mg/Nm . Total costs of these installations (excluding civil works) amount to
about US$5.3 million. To control noise pollution, appropriate abatement
precautions have been taken at the noise generating mills and crushers.
Finally, sewage treatment facilities have been installed to treat liquid
effluents. Total cost of antipollution measures, including mechanical and
electrical equipment and civil works, was about US$11.4 million.
E. Project Capital Cost
3.12      Total financing required for the project amounted to DH 819.4
million, DH 0.9 million or 0.1% above the appraisal estimate of DH 818.6
million. In US$ terms, the total financing required was US$204.9 million
compared to US$181.9 million estimated during appraisal, the 12.6% difference
resulting mainly from the decline of the value of the US$ between appraisal
and the dates when the costs of the project were incurred.

3.15      At the time of appraisal, contracts had been signed for the procure-
ment of about 80% of the project items. This unusual situation for Bank
projects was caused by the Bank's postponement of appraisal until a late stage
in project preparation (para 1.03). Consequently, the actual costs are
very close to estimates, which in many cases were based on contracted prices.
Nevertheless, cost overruns have been experienced, particularly in civil
works, and interest during contruction. The civil works cost overrun was
mainly the result of (i) the delay in project implementation, and (ii) a
higher inflation rate than foreseen. According to the Bank estimates in 1977,
price contingencies in DH terms had been based on an assumed 8% inflation
rate from 1977 onwards. The real inflation rates in Morocco have been above



- 9 -
the appraisal estimate 1/. The cost overrun in interest during construction
represents payments of 6% interest on the ODI participation in the capital of
CIMA (para. 2.01) passed on to CIOR as a loan without repayment schedule
and increases on all debt due to late project completion, with partial
compensation through slower disbursement than foreseen. On the other hand,
cost overruns were largely compensated by cost underruns because
of (i) scope changes in the main equipment contract that were less than the
physical contingency of 5% calculated at appraisal, (ii) initial working
capital requirements that have been below the appraisal estimate, and (iii)
late completion penalties for civil works (DH 3.0 million), and the main
equipment supply contract (DH 10.5 million). Details of CIOR-s working
capital are given in Annex 3-4.

3.17      The major difference between the financing plan agreed during
appraisal and the actual project financing resulted from the inability of
the Moroccan Government to provide treasury advances in the amounts committed,
due to the economic situation of the country. The lack of funds from the
Government, DH 226.5 million equivalent, was compensated by: (i) a FADES loan
of DH 133.9 million, (ii) a loan from ODI of DH 45.0 million, corresponding to
the sale by ODI of CIOR shares (18% of the company-s equity) to the Islamic
Development Bank which ODI in turn provided as a loan to CIOR, and (iii) DH
68.1 million of cash generation. The short-comings of Government funds did
not pose significant problems in project implementation since part of the
project costs were disbursed after start-up of production and could therefore
be financed by cash generation, and to a lesser extent by short term debt
which was used to finance fixed investments in the absence of working capital
requirement at the anticipated levels. These late disbursements consisted of
(i) payments of major contracts such as civil works and equipment which were
due after project start-up, and (ii) payments for the construction of the
housing facilities for workers which was finalized after completion of the
plant. The lack of Government funds, however, resulted in a tight financial
situation for CIOR and has hampered CIOR in meeting the financial covenants
agreed with the Bank (para 5.07). Other differences between the planned and
actual financing scheme of the project include (i) minor shortfalls (DH 8
million) in the provision of equity funds by the Moroccan Government, and (ii)
lower DH value of the IBRD loan due to the decline of the value of the US
dollar which was not anticipated during appraisal. These gaps were met by
internal cash generation.
G. Disbursement of Bank Loan and Procurement
3.18      A comparison between the items actually financed by the Bank loan
with the appraisal expectation is detailed in Annex 3-5 and summarized below:

- 11 -
3.19      At appraisal, contracts had already been signed for 80% of the
items to be financed by the Bank. The allocation of disbursement of the Bank
loan was therefore almost the same as planned during appraisal. In agreement
with CIOR, it was decided in early 1979, to use the unallocated category to
finance part of the civil works costs related to the Fes terminal, as well as
technical assistance after project start-up.
3.20      Procurement of civil works, equipment and services was carried out
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
guidelines. For purposes of bid evaluation, domestic suppliers were given
a 15% margin of preference. According to CIOR, Bank involvement has con-
siderably helped to ensure adequate project PreParation and. because of Bank
procurement procedures (ICB), to establish a clear relationship with suppliers.
On the other hand, Bank procurement procedures prevented price negotiations
which, in CIOR's opinion, could have brought the project costs to a lower
level. CIOR also estimates that the package per package approach, which was
used in the procurement of the project, was less costly as compared to a
turn-key approach.
3.21      The following table gives a break down by supplying countries of
the equipment, civil works and services contracts procured under the project.

3.22      The Bank loan became effective in July 1977 and initially disbursed
quickly as the Bank loan included retroactive financing of US$ 5.0 million on
contracts signed prior to signing of the loan. Then followed a period of
slower disbursement, reflecting the delay in project implementation. This
delay was caught up largely during FY 1979. The initial loan closing date of
June 30, 1980 was delayed until December 31, 1981, to allow CIOR to finance
operating technical assistance. Details of disbursement of the Bank loan are
given in Annex 3-6.
IV. THE DOMESTIC CEMENT MARKET AND PRICING
A. Historic and Projected Demand/Supply Balance and Project's Impact
4.01      Prior to and during appraisal, the market projections for cement
in Morocco were extensively discussed between the Bank and the Moroccan
authorities. Based on a fast growing economy resulting from the surge in
phosphate prices, CIOR at the time was projecting cement consumption using
high growth rates over long periods. In spite of a more conservative approach
by the Bank, appraisal estimates of supply and consumption were higher than
actual developments. Annex 4-1 shows that in 1981 actual cement consumption
was about 26% lower than appraisal estimates, and that deviations from
appraisal estimates are particularly apparent during 1978-81. In these years
consumption only grew by 0.9% per year, as compared to 9.4% per year during
1976-78, because of a slump in the Moroccan economy and the construction
industry in particular. These projections are summarized below:

4.02      At appraisal, the forecast of Moroccan cement consumption was based
on different methods, including (i) an international comparison of cement
consumption per capita, (ii) a macro-economic forecast using a regression
equation with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Fixed Capital Formation
(GFCF) as independent variables, (iii) an extrapolation of past consumption,
and (iv) a sectorial analysis. The "most likely" forecast was based on a GNP
growth rate of 7% per year, which was expected to lead to a cement consumption
per capita of 225 kg in 1980. Over the period 1976-80, however, the actual
GDP growth was on average about 4.9% per year, (4.7% per year for 1978-80),
and in 1980 the actual cement consumption per capita reached only 178 kg. On
the supply side, actual growth fell short of appraisal estimates by 22% in
1981, mainly as a result of the postponement of some projects. Annex 4-1
shows a comparison of estimated and actual production per plant. In 1981,
Moroccan cement supply and demand were in balance with no imports and produc-
tion capacity about 15% above cement consumption.
4.03      With sales of 730,000 tons in 1981, CIOR achieved a 20% market
share in that year, and although achieved from lower supply and consumption
levels than projected during appraisal, the share is in line with the appraisal
estimate of a 22% market share in 1981. 1/ Appraisal estimates were also
quite accurate with respect to the projection of cement consumption in the
Oriental region (actual 450,000 tons in 1980, versus 460,000 tons estimated)
where CIOR sold 64% of its cement in 1981. This region accounted for 13.5% of
Moroccan cement consumption in that year. The remainder of CIOR sales were to
the Fes Region (29%), Casablanca (6%), and exports (1%). Details of CIOR
sales are given in Annex 4-2.
4.04      Market projections are detailed in Annex 4-3 and summarized in the
following table.

- 14 -
Overall, cement consumption is expected to grow by 7.0% per year during
1981-85, which would be somewhat lower than the 9.9% average increase during
1975-80. Domestic supply would grow by 9.1% per year (based on plant capa-
cities between 1982-85), taking into account the start up of the new Lafarge
plant in Casablanca in 1984, and the reaching of full capacity of 1.2 million
tons by CIOR in 1986. As a result, during the mid-1980-s, a supply capacity
surplus is projected with a maximum of 385,000 tons in 1984, which will taper
off thereafter. For CIOR, this is expected to have a downward effect on the
prices for its cement sold outside the Oriental and Fes regions during that
period.
4.05      It is further projected that CIOR will have to market a substantial
portion of its cement production outside the Oriental and Fes regions, with a
maximum of about 220,000 tons (18% of production) in 1986, when the plant
is expected to reach full capacity. Part of these surpluses could be marketed
in the regions that are projected to have a supply deficit and CIOR is making
arrangements to sell the major part of its surpluses to the Casablanca area,
which has the largest projected deficit (para 4.09; Annex 4-3). Although
CIOR's production costs are competitive with the other Moroccan cement plants
(para. 5.04), its distance from the Western part of Morocco gives it a
transportation cost disadvantage (para 4.09).
B.   Distribution and Transport
4.06      CIOR markets its bagged cement through a network of about 100
wholesalers, which are selected by the Government. CIOR also delivers bulk
cement directly to large customers.
4.07      In view of CIOR's surplus capacity in the Oriental region, a French
firm was selected in 1978 to carry out a study for the distribution terminal
in Fes, located in the Central region, which does not have its own cement
plant, and where acute cement shortages were frequent. The distribution
center consists of two cement silos of 5,000 tons each, bagging facilities,
and facilities to load trucks. It went into operation in July 1979, as
initially scheduled, and has operated satisfactorily. In 1981, CIOR sold
214,000 tons or 29% of total sales in the Fes region.
4.08      Transport of cement from the plant to the Fes terminal is by rail
silo wagons. During negotiations, the Government had agreed to provide
Office National des Chemins de Fer (ONCF), the Moroccan railway company,, with
the necessary funds to acquire silo wagons for the transport of CIOR excess
production. The Government was unable to meet this commitment and CIOR had
to seek other arrangements, which were made with the Islamic Development Bank.
Under these arrangements, the Islamic Development Bank has financed 85 silo
wagons. During the time that the wagons were under construction in 1979-80,
CIOR made use of 25 wagons made available by ONCF.
4.09      To handle the anticipated sales of CIOR cement in the Casablanca
area, CIOR is establishing a new distribution center in Casablanca with a
capacity of 200,000 tpy of bagged cement. Start-up of the Centre is



- 15 -
planned for mid-1982. Transport from the Oujda plant and the Fes Center
to Casablanca will be by rail at a cost of around DH 80 (US$15) per ton from
Oujda. In 1982, it is expected that CIOR will ship about 100,000 tons to
Casablanca.
C. Pricing
4.10      One of the major issues related to the project at the time of
appraisal was the setting of cement prices in Morocco. Cement prices in
Morocco were fixed by the Government from the ex-factory to the retail level.
These prices remained virtually unchanged, for many years until 1975, at about
DH 100 (US$25) per ton of bagged cement, about 15% lower than the domestic
cement prices in Europe, and 40% lower than the cost of imported cement.
Furthermore, prices were set on a per plant basis in a rather ad-hoc manner,
without real concern about the producers' return on investment and efficiency.
As a result, these low ex-factory prices penalized efficient plants, and most
probably discouraged new investment in the cement sector.
4.11      Prior to and during appraisal, the Bank discussed in detail various
cement pricing mechanisms with the Moroccan authorities. It was agreed
to undertake a study that would propose a new pricing and distribution
mechanism and investment incentives. The study was undertaken by a British
firm in 1978.
4.12      Based on the discussion with the Bank and IFC, and later to some
extent based on the study's recommendations, the Government made various
changes in the pricing system. In 1975, the Government decided to increase
the ex-factory prices of all cement producers by about 30%. Part of the
additional profits resulting from the price increase was channeled through
taxes into a separate cement account created within the Price Equalization
Fund (Caisse de Compensation), the revenues of which are to be used exclusively
for the benefit of the cement sector, i.e. to encourage the creation of new
cement capacity, for instance through cash payments to assist new plants
during their early years of production. As a second step, in 1976, the
Government adopted the policy, for new cement companies as well as for exist-
ing companies agreeing to expand, of regulating their ex-factory revenues,
including payments to or from the Price Equalization Fund, to levels calculated
to enable them to pay regular dividends.
4.13      Finally, in January 1982, the Moroccan Government went a step
further toward deregulating cement pricing in Morocco and introduced a revised
cement pricing system. After further discussion amongst the Government, the
Moroccan cement producers and Bank Group staff, the Government has installed a
new pricing and distribution system, whose main features are (i) the setting
of a uniform cement ceiling price with freedom of pricing below that level,
(ii) abolition of the zoning system of individual plants' sales, (iii) limited
payments by the Price Equalization Fund to the new CIOR and Asment plants,
which are financed from per-ton-revenue contributions from the six other
plants, and (iv) a price adjustment formula which makes automatic adjustments
of cement prices for changes in the cost of fuel and electricity, and regular
adjustments for changes in other cost items. As a result, the new cement
ceiling price levels are now as follows:

a/ Moroccan and CIOR cement prices for 1975-82 are given in Annexes 4-4 and 4-5.
4.14      Under the new pricing system, producers will also have to set aside
a certain margin from their sales revenue to be determined individually for
each plant, which will be used for financing required investments in the
cement industry. These sums will be considered as debt vis-a-vis the Govern-
ment until their effective utilization in investments in the cement industry.
Wholesalers  and retailers   margins are fixed uniformly as:   DH 10 per ton
(US$1.80 per ton) for wholesale, and DH 17 per ton (US$3.10 per ton) for
retail. Ceiling prices after tax ex-plant, and increased by above margins,
cannot be increased further except for transport charges to distribution
centers on the basis of the most economic transport available. The Bank has
requested the Moroccan Government to abolish these fixed distribution margins,
and to allow cement plants to sell their bagged cement directly to their
clients rather than through distributors as is presently required. In the
case of CIOR, transport charges of bulk rail movements from Oujda to its
distribution center in Fes will remain fully covered by the Price Equal-
ization Fund.
4.15      The new pricing system is certainly an improvement over previous
pricing arrangements. After several years of discussions on an improved
system, in which the Bank was involved through the pricing and distribution
study (para 4.11) and through our supervision missions, the Moroccan author-
ities have taken an important step towards price liberalization and toward the
improved profitability of the industry. The new prices should allow an
efficient plant a sufficient return on equity, and an incentive for further
expansion once the Moroccan cement market improves. The ex-works price before
tax of US$71.10 per ton (bagged CPA 325) are competitive with landed costs of
bagged cement in Morocco, which is estimated at US$75.0 per ton (para 5.09),
and should be sufficient to cover total production costs of a new 600,000 tpy
oilfired greenfield plant, and operating at 85% of capacity utilization.

V. PROJECT OPERATION
A. Production Build-Up and Sales
5.01      CIOR's production facilities consist of two production lines,
each with a capacity of 558,000 tpy of clinker 1/ and 600,000 tpy of
cement 2/. Line 1 went into operations in December 1978 (6 months behind
appraisal estimate) and line 2 in June 1979 (10 months behind appraisal
estimate). Build-up of both clinker and cement production in the two first
years of operation remained below appraisal expectations, as illustrated by
following table:

b/   Estimate.
Actual performance was below appraisal estimates due to lower than anticipated
Moroccan cement market and some technical problems with the one of the two
kilns. In 1980, one kiln was out of operation for 2 months due to relining,
start-up problems with satelite coolers, and large stocks of clinker as a
consequence of a delay in finalizing the arrangements to sell to the Casablanca
area, resulting in excess production. Out of total cement production of
734,500 tons in 1981, 99.3% was Portland cement (CPA 325) and 0.7% a lower
quality cement (CM 250) with a higher amount of additives. Additives to
clinker, gypsum and pozzolana were on average 17% in 1981. Production of
clinker and cement is detailed in Annex 5-1.
5.02      CIOR now expects to reach full production in 1986, 8 years after
start-up of the second kiln. The appraisal estimated full production after 4
years and 4 months, but CIOR's expected production build-up now is more
realistic given the lower than expected production in the first 3 years, and
the domestic market constraints.

Overall, it is now estimated that CIOR's operating costs at full production
will be 93% higher in real terms than estimated at appraisal. The main
differences are the higher than anticipated costs of energy (fuel oil and
electricity) due to much higher than expected increases in units costs, and
the higher costs of labor due to higher employment than anticipated (para
3.06). The higher costs for energy are analyzed in following table.

5.05      Given the high costs of energy inputs and their burden on CIOR's
operating costs, CIOR is preparing a project to convert its plant from fuel
firing to coal firing. Engineering work has been carried out and CIOR
was expected to issue tender documents in April, 1982 and to sign equipment
contracts in July, 1982. Start-up of the coal firing facilities could be by
January, 1984. The coal conversion project would be very attractive with an
economic rate of return of about 30%. The main obstacle for the project is
the existing pricing structure of fuel oil and imported coal in Morocco, which
form a strong bias against the use of coal by many industries. The Government
is expected to align the tax and duty structure on fuel oil and coal, and to
remove the subsidy on fuel oil, so that the new prices for these energy
sources would reflect their economic costs.
C.   Financial Performance and Rate of Return
5.06      The financial position of CIOR during the three years of its opera-
tions has been disappointing compared to what was expected at the time of
appraisal.   The financial statements and projections for the period 1977-86
are shown in Annex 5-3, and the major financial indicators for 1979-81 appear
below:

The disappointing financial performance of CIOR during 1979-81 as compared
to appraisal estimates is mainly caused by a delay in start-up of the production
facilities and a slower production build-up than expected (para 5.01), resulting
in a lower capacity utilization and higher fixed costs relative to sales than
foreseen.
5.07      The main financial covenants that CIOR agreed to with the Bank
were to maintain at all times: (i) a minimum current ratio of 1.3; (ii) a
maximum debt/equity ratio of 60:40; and (iii) a minimum debt service coverage
of 1.5. As has been shown above, CIOR has not been able to comply with these
covenants, as a result of (i) some changes in the project financing plan as
compared to appraisal (para 3.17), and (ii) a financial performance below
appraisal estimates. As mentioned earlier, the Government has not come
forward with sufficient funds to allow CIOR to meet the financial covenants
agreed with the Bank. Despite the insistance of the Bank during supervision
missions to provide equity to CIOR, Government has not done so to the extent
required. With the increased prices (para. 4.13), however, CIOR's financial
performance is expected to improve considerably, with regular profits. As a
result its financial position will also improve. The current ratio is expected
to increase from 1.0 in 1981 to 1.3 in 1983 and the debt/equity ratio from
73:27 to 55:45 in 1984. Details of projections of the main financial state-
ments and ratios are given in Annex 5-3.
5.08      For the purpose of making a new estimate of the financial rate of
return for the project, the cost and revenue streams were expressed in 1981
constant prices. For domestic sales, the January 1982 selling prices have
been maintained in real terms but at depressed levels for cement sales outside
the Oriental and Fes regions during 1982-88 due to cement surplus capacity
during that period (para 4.04), and with phasing out of the contributions from
the Price Equalization Fund after 1984. Under these assumptions, the financial
rate of return is calculated at 10.7%, as compared to 10.0% estimated at the
time of appraisal (Annex 5-4).
D. Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
5.09      In calculating the economic rate of return, financial costs and
benefits of the project have been adjusted as follows:
(i) domestic selling prices of bagged cement were replaced by
opportunity costs, i.e., the cost of cement imports replaced by
the project.

a/   Price for clinker was assumed at US$50 (DH255) FOB Nador port.
b/   Bagged cement based on imports of bulk cement with bagging at port
facilities.
(ii)  capital costs and operating costs have been adjusted by deducting
all taxes, and shadow pricing unskilled labor at 75% of
financial cost (same as at appraisal), fuel oil and electricity;
(iii)  transport and distribution costs have been taken into account
for the cement sold by CIOR outside the Oriental region for 16
years, after which cement consumption in the Oriental region is
projected to absorb all of CIOR's output.
5.10      Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate of return is
calculated at 11.5%, as compared to 13.8% estimated at the time of appraisal
(Annex 5-5). This rate is based on fuel oil firing of the CIOR plant.
With the coal conversion (para 5.05), presently under study, and expected
to start-up in 1984, the economic rate of return would increase to 12.3%.
VI. THE BANK-s ROLE
A. Project Formulation and Supervision
6.01      The Bank played a major role in assisting CIOR and the Moroccan
authorities in adequate preparation and implementation of the project. First,
when Algeria withdrew from the project, the Bank assisted CIOR to analyze the
various options in order to decide on the future course of action. Second,
during appraisal, Bank assistance was particularly useful in establishing a
reasonable financing plan and to outline the main features of the company s
distribution system. Third, Bank requirements in terms of technical assistance
arrangements have been a major factor in enabling the Company to execute the



- 23 -
project relatively efficiently and to achieve normal production levels rapidly.
In particular, the studies of the distribution and transport of CIOR-s produc-
tion, the training program for the Company's personnel, the organization of
the accounting, financial planning and budgeting systems, as well as the
technical assistance arrangements which were made after production start-up
have been recognized as very useful. Fourth, Bank procurement guidelines have
contributed to establish a clear relationship with suppliers. Fifth, the
Bank's involvement has encouraged FADES and the Islamic Development Bank to
participate in the financing of the project and to provide funds on favorable
terms and conditions.
6.02      The Bank's involvement has had a positive effect on the Moroccan
cement sector overall. The long discussions between the Bank and the Moroccan
authorities on the market outlook for cement in Morocco have helped better
planning of the investments in the sector. The dialogue with the Bank has
been helpful helpful in persuading the Government to establish more realistic
cement prices. During project implementation, prices have been increased in
real terms at regular intervals, after having been virtually frozen until
1975. The studies on the Moroccan cement pricing and distribution system
carried out as part of the project, and the Bank's supervision missions have
contributed toward the establishment of a new cement pricing and distribution
system which is an important step toward the liberalization of cement prices
and distribution in Morocco.
B. Lessons to be Learned
6.03      Overall lessons can be drawn by the Bank from the experience of
the CIOR project. First, the personality of Mr. Ennadifi, who has headed CIOR
since the early stage of project preparation, confirms that the caliber and
stability of top management, is a key element in ensuring the success of a
project. Open to advice, knowing how to motivate the staff, anxious to keep a
good relationship with the Board, the Moroccan administration and the lending
institutions, he has succeeded in mobilizing the efforts of all involved
parties for the achievement of the project goals. Second, the Bank has
underestimated the difficulties resulting from the location of the project in
a remote area. In such circumstances, more precautions should be taken in
evaluating the project implementation schedule as well as the experience of
consultants and suppliers in working in this type of environment. Third, the
impact of the Bank on the major sector issue of cement pricing and distribution
has been rather slow, as only in early 1982 steps were taken towards liberation
of pricing and distribution (para. 4.13). Improvements might have been
forthcoming faster if they would have been made a condition of the Bank loan.
In order not to jeopardize the timing of project processing, this underscores
the need to identify major sector issues early in the project cycle, and carry
out necessary studies and discussions with the Government in tandem with
preparation, appraisal, and negotiations of the Bank loan.    Fourth, the Bank's
appraisal projections of Moroccan cement consumption have turned out to be
unduly optimistic because of the sustained depressed economic conditions in
Morocco during the late 1970's and early 1980's.    To make provisions for such
conditions in future projects, more attention should be paid to short or
medium term projections deviating from trend or long term projections based on
steady growth rates, possibly in the form of a sensitivity analys:is.

For attention of the Director,
Operations Evaluation Department
Subject: Report on the Results of the CIOR Project, Morocco (Loan 1383-MOR)
Dear Sir:
We thank you for your report on the results of the Cimenterie de l'Oriental
(CIOR) Project.
The management of CIOR has already communicated to you, following the various
missions that took place in connection with the drafting of this report, full
updated information on the execution of the project.
We should like to offer here a few general remarks deriving from reading of
the report, which recounts exhaustively the various aspects of implementation
of the project.
1.   As regards the structure of project financing, although the financing
deficit was only partly covered by Treasury advances, the Government has taken
other measures assuring the project of adequate financing without compromising
its execution.
Thus, the Government made representations to international financing insti-
tutions that enable the Company to obtain loans on advantageous terms.
Moreover, the Government has acted, through its procedures for setting
selling prices, to grant subsidies to CIOR through which it can mobilize funds
to finance the residue of its investments.



ANNEX 1
- 25 -                           Page  2
In this way, the Government has complied fully with its obligations by
contributing the necessary financial support whenever necessary.
2.   It appears to us that your report does not bring out the role of the prin-
cipal shareholder sufficiently clearly, having regard to the efforts it has
undertaken throughout the execution of the Project.
This action has taken the following forms, among others:
a) Timely contributions of funds enabling the Company to meet is
commitments under satisfactory conditions;
b) Representations throughout the Project to the Administration
and the public authorities to facilitate the obtaining of
authorizations needed for execution of the Project;
c) Promotion of distribution centers to increase the Company's
sales volume;
d) Guarantees to suppliers and sources of funds to take over the
Project following withdrawal by the Algerian shareholder;
e) Coordination, monitoring and financing of the study through
which the present price-setting system came into effect;
f) Delegation of powers to the Company's Management, thereby
providing it with efficient means of management on a par
with private companies.
3.   It also seems to us that the report does not stress sufficiently the effort
undertaken by the Company in the area of social infrastructure, which has been
one of the factors of personnel stability and therefore of satisfactory operation
of the plant.
4.   Finally, we feel that mention should have been made of the promotional
activity in the area of construction materials, which has already borne fruit
through the construction of a brickworks at Taza in association with local
savers.
We trust that these comments can be embodied in the final version of
your report.
Yours truly,
/s/ Mohamed Belkhayat
