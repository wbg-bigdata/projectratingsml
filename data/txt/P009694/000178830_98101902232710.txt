INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for the equivalent of US$16.4 million on standard
IDA terms, to help finance a project for providing dairy processing facili-
ties and developing an integrated dairying system in the State of Madhya
Pradesh.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN, dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the extreme diffictilty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of
which are attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation
of conflicting political views tends to favor less than optimal economic
solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the Govern-
ment. Governing a country divided into more than 20 states with a population
of some 580 million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility.
The country's poverty and poor natural resource endowment, supplemented by
a net transfer of external resources averaging in recent years well below
US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of growth.
Any judgment of India's economic performance must take these underlying cir-
cumstances into account. So, also, must account be taken of the uncertainties
imposed by the uncertain availability of water. A bad monsoon, which is in-
evitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy
and wipes out the results of years of effort.
4.        In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly 4% per
annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth rate of
less than 1% during the preceding 50 years. Population has also grown faster
in the past two decades than previously, but per capita income has neverthe-
less risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first half of this
century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1% a year since independence.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high
cost and has yielded results of variable quality; many industrial and agri-
cultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others have taken



- 2 -
excessively long to be completed and have operated well below full capacity;
in some regions of the country growth and structural change have been rapid
and compare favorably with developments in many other parts of the world,
but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly even decline.
Despite these improvements and althoughi the distribution of income in India
is relatively even by comparison with many other countries, there has been
little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses of the urban
and rural population. The Government has become increasingly concerned
about the plight of the lower income strata which, conservatively measured,
consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than US$60 per head
per year, and has initiated in recent years a variety of programs specifically
designed to alleviate poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 43% of
national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years
previously. The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has
increased onlv slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23%. There has, however, been a shift in the com-
position of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital
goods now contributing about one-third each compared with an overwhelming
preponderence of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        The economic report contained a review of the immense difficulties
confronting the Indian economy as the Fourth Plan period drew to a close.
The final year of the Plan, 1973/74, witnessed a severe deterioration in
India's terms of trade which was led by, but by no means restricted to, the
dramatic increase in oil prices. The resulting balance of payments difficul-
ties were compounded by the need for food imports following the drought of
1972/73, in order to sustain the public distribution system on which the
poorest section of society is particularly dependent. Given India's perva-
sively agricultural economy, the drought also had the effect of causinlg a
general slow-down in economic activity which was further aggravated by
infrastructure constraints, particularly widespread power shortages and
labor problens of Indian Railways. Food shortages and other scarcities
touched off an unprecedented inflationary spiral fueled by large budgetary
deficits which were at least partly attributable to mounting expenditures
for drought relief. The inflation in turn contributed to labor unrest while
efforts to cope with it through budgetary cuts affected, among other things,
the level of real expenditures for development programs.
8.        Thus, at the commencement of the Fifth Plan period (1974/75-1978/79)
the most urgent tasks facing policy makers were:   to get agricultural pro-
duction moving again; to bring inflation under control; to reduce India's
dependence on oil imports by compressing energy consumption and by formulating
and implementing programs to develop domestic energy sources; to boost export
earnings and to tap additional sources of aid in order to sustain imports;
and, finally, to maintain a minimum1 investment program so as to avoid economic
standstill in the longer run. Even in the best of times, it would have been
extremely difficult to pursue simultaneously such a variety of potentially
inconsistent objectives.



-3-
9.        Events since the preparation of the last economic report provide
little encouragement. For the second time in the last three years, the weather
has let down India's farmers with the result that the kharif (fall) crop
recently harvested is believed to be considerably below last year's (about
60 million tons as compared with 67 million tons). The outlook for the next
rabi (spring) crop is uncertain in view of continuing shortages of power
for irrigation pumps and possible fertilizer shortages. The reduced avail-
ability of foodgrains, the depletion of official food stocks, India's
balance of payments difficulties, the inflationary setting and frequent
changes in the Government's food procurement policy have led to hoarding for
both speculative and insurance purposes. Procurement for public distribution
has become extremely difficult. The public kitchens established in some of
the worst-affected areas (Bihar, Bengal, Orissa) bear evidence of the serious-
ness of the situation as well as of the Government's determination to prevent
extreme hardship.
10.       The spectre of massive food import requirements hangs over an
already very difficult balance of payments situation in the current year.
The need for six to seven million tons of foodgrains imports appears evident,
and considerably more than half this amount either has been delivered
already or has been purchased. There is little evidence of a major break
in the prices of other commodities imported in substantial quantities by
India (e.g. oil, fertilizers, steel, non-ferrous metals, rock phosphate).
11.       One of the few bright spots in the balance of payments picture
has been the growth of export earnings. In 1973/74 export earnings recorded
an unprecedented increase of about 30% and there are indications of a similar
increase in the current year. While these increases - particularly that
in 1973/74 - are primarily attributable to unit value increases caused by
worldwide inflation, there is greater willingness to take advantage of
export opportunities, as illustrated most dramatically by the recent diversion
of sugar from domestic consumption to exports.
12.       Nevertheless, despite the increase in export earnings, India is
expected to run a massive trade deficit this year - probably of the order
of US$1,600 million as compared with US$795 million in 1973/74 and a negli-
gible one the previous year. Moreover, despite the magnitude of the current
deficit, it is unlikely that India's imports, excluding foodgrains, will
be as large in volume as in 1972/73. In addition to financing a trade
deficit of this order, India will have to meet debt service payments of about
US$730 million. These financing requirements will be partly offset through
Consortium assistance and USSR aid, which are together expected to reach
disbursement levels of about US$1,550 million in 1974/75 compared with
about US$1,270 million in 1973/74. The deferred payment arrangements for
part of her oil requirements that India is understood to have reached with
Iran and Iraq will also provide welcome relief. Nevertheless, these various
sources of financing hardly measure up to India's current requirements. India
will have to draw on her foreign exchange reserves, which, at about US$1,300
million, are currently equivalent to less than three months of imports. India
has also drawn US$375 million on the IMF in the current year. The Government



also intends to make use of the IMF oil facility, and a drawing on this
facility of about US$240 million has been recently approved for use in
calendar year 1974.
13.       On the domestic front, the Government's present efforts are con-
centrated primarily on maximizing production in key sectors through a system
of priorities in the allocation of scarce resources and through careful
monitoring of developments and performance. In agriculture this entails
provision of power on a priority basis for minor irrigation and fertilizer
production and allocation of adequate foreign exchange for as much fertilizer
as can be imported from the limited world supplies. Similarly, efforts are
made to identify production bottlenecks in such sectors as fertilizer pro-
duction, coal mining and power generation; and special arrangements exist
for meeting expeditiously the foreign exchange requirements of these sectors
for such items as captive power units where appropriate, spares and replace-
ment parts. The railways are also tied into this system and accord priority
to the movement of goods required by these sectors. In the fertilizer, coal
and power sectors, senior officials are provided on a continuing basis with
detailed production figures along with explanations for production shortfalls.
Attempts are also being made to rationalize the administrative machinery of
the Government in these sectors, as evidenced by the October 1974 decision
to bring irrigation under the wing of the Food and Agriculture Ministry
and to regroup power generation and coal mining under an Energy Ministry.
14.       In the short term, however, there are limits to the extent to which
India's dependence oni oil imports can be reduced and production of domestic
sources of energy can be stepped up. Insofar as the compression of demand
for oil products is concerned, these limits are determined, on the one hand,
bv the relatively small proportion of oil products used for private con-
sumption (possibly one-sixth) and, on the other hand, by the limited avail-
ability of domestic substitutes (i.e. coal and power).    The 13 million to'ls
of crude oil plus 3 million tons of product imports planned for thie current
year probably represent the lower limit beyond whicih these imports cannot be
curbed without serious repercussions Oti domestic production. lHad consumption
been allowed to grow in line withi recent trends, the present level of crude
and product imports taken together would probably be of the order of at
least 18 million tons.
15.       A major effort is being made to use existing capacity as fully as
possible throughout the economy.   To this end, despite the serious balance
of payments problem described above, the Government is pursuing a relatively
liberal policy toward imports of rai7 materials required by industry.   Never-
theless, it is hard to get away from the current infrastructure constraints
and particularly the shortage and unreliability of power supplies which,
though somewhat eased, continue to affect production. Fiscal and monetary
policies, including the cutback in budgetary expenditures and limitations
on bank credit, are also restraining industrial output; and there is some
evidence that, due to rapidly rising food prices and the consequent erosion
of real purchasing power, the demand for some consumer items and industrial
projects is being affected. Given the various constraints, there is likely



-5-
to be little or no industrial growth in the current year which, in combination
with the current agricultural situation, makes it unlikely that there will
be any GNP growth either. In regard to inflation, the Government has made
impressive efforts to curb budgetary expenditures and to tap additional
sources of revenue. However, not surprisingly, in view of continuing food
shortages and other scarcities, inflation has not abated. The wholesale
price index, which in 1973/74 had recorded an increase of 29% over the pre-
vious year, has risen by a further 14% during the first five months of this
fiscal year.
16.       In present circumstances the Draft Fifth Plan, published in late
1973, has not been finalized. In real terms investment in the current Annual
Plan is about 30% below the annual level implicit in the Draft Fifth Plan,
and even this is unlikely to be reached. To adjust to reduced resource
availability a number of investments are being postponed. Expenditures on
some of the social sectors such as education and family planning are un-
fortunately also affected. The focus once again is primarily on investments
in key sectors such as fertilizer, coal, power, and steel, and quite rightly
within these sectors the emphasis is on completing ongoing investments
before committing resources to new schemes.
17.       In the long run, given her groundwater, coal, hydroelectric, iron
ore, non-ferrous metals and human resources, India undoubtedly has the
capability to overcome her present difficulties. It is, however, clear that
to overcome them and to resume the interrupted process of economic development,
India will require substantially larger capital inflows than foreseen by the
authors of the Draft Fifth Plan. It is equally clear that as large as pos-
sible a proportion of these requirements should be provided on concessional
terms. However, even on very optimistic assumptions regarding India's suc-
cess in narrowing her resource gap and the response of both Consortium and
other donors, a gap will remain between external financing requirements
and the availability of concessional aid.
18.       India's external public debt outstanding on March 31, 1973, stood
at US$9.9 billion. As a consequence of world-wide inflation and its effects
on India's export earnings, service payments of about US$730 million due
on this debt in 1974/75 are expected to be equivalent to about 17% of merchan-
dise exports as compared with about 26% in 1972/73. However, substantial
additional debt will have to be incurred as a result of increases in the
prices of India's imports. In the future, therefore, the debt service ratio
is likely to rise, given the magnitude of India's requirements and the un-
avoidability of having to finance part of these on non-concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 42 loans and 63 development
credits to India totalling US$1,229 million and US$2,880 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$655 million has been



- 6 -
repaid, and US$1,112 million was still undisbursed as of October 31, 1974
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of October 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$7.6 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$20.8 million, US$13.7 million
represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of October 31, 1974 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are
other agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer
sector and through its sizeable assistance to development finance institu-
tions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale
industrial enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and com-
ponents for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating
better capacity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active
in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and related
urban investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities.    The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant.   The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
by the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designied to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit and on-farm investments, command area development of existine, irriga-
tion schemes, and seed production form an important aspect of the Bank Group s
program for the next several years.   Special emphasis will be given to
projects benefitting small farmers and landless laborers as does the present
dairy project. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial invest-
ments will focus on energy-related projects. Repeater credits for power
and railways have high priority in this context, and discussions are under
way with the Government in an effort to identify and prepare projects
specifically designed to facilitate coal production and coal transport.
Lending for fertilizer projects, which has been an important feature in
recent years, is expected to occupy an even more prominent place in the
future program; the use of coal-based technology will receive particular
attention.
23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within tlhe India Consortium. The need for read-
ily usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when
output and investment have to he adjusted to a radically different price



situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw
materials and components continues to he an essential element within the
overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors,
it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70 the Bank Group
accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13X of gross disbursements, and 12,%'
of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 35%, 28% and 42%, respec-
tively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected to
continue growing. Whereas on March 31, 1973, the Bank Group's share of
India's outstanding external public debt was 21%, by 1979 it is likely to
account for about 25%.   Because Bank Group assistance to India is predomi-
nantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise
slowly. In 1972/73 about 13% of India's total debt service payments were
to the Bank Group.
PART III - DAIRYING IN INDIA
25.       This project in Madhya Pradesh will contribute to the development
of Indian agriculture, which accounts for about 43% of Indian GNP and employs
72% of the total work force. Although Government of India's (OI) emphasis
in the sector in recent years has been to increase the output of foodgrains,
it is attempting to diversify where appropriate, with special attention to
the dairy sub-sector.   Over the past two decades there has been a marked
decline in per capita consumption of milk, a primary source of animal protein
for the bulk of the population. Efforts are now being made to increase milk
production from 21 million tons in 1972 to 3O million by 1979.    The project,
as in the case of the Karnataka Dairy Development Project approved on June 13,
1974 and the Rajasthan Dairy Development Project being presented today, is
designed to make a significant contribution towards this target.
26.       A large proportion of the world's bovine popttlation is in India.
It has 17% of the worldls cattle and 50%, of its buffalo.   Ilowever, indigenous
varieties produce very low milk yields.   Their main contribution has been to
provide draft power and to support a small livestock industry accounting for
14% of the total agricultural sector's share of GNP and about 5% of total
exports. To increase milk production significantly, a large-scale effort
to develop higher yielding animals and expansion of animal health care and
breeding facilities is required.



-8-
27.       Crossbreeding of indigenous cattle with exotic varieties to pro-
duce higher yielding dairy cattle has been conducted in India for many years,
so far with only limited success. With one rather notable exception, dairy
development has not been accompanied by adequate institutional support,
effective organization of small and marginal farmers (who produce most of the
millk) into economically viable units, nor by development of adequate facilities
for milk collection, processing and marketing. Nor has there been adequate
provision of animal health care and technical services to farmers. Few
farmers use thcir land principally for dairy production, which remains
essentially a subsidiary farm activity. There is also a shortage of animal
feed in the countrv. If a significant increase in milk production is to be
achieved, additional feed must be made available or more of the available
feed must be reserved for high yielding animals. The demand for cereal
grains as human food and the favorable export position of oilseeds and oilcake
preclude any significant increase in the supply of concentrate feed for live-
stock. It is, therefore, important to encourage small farmers to develop
animal production systems which will result in more efficient use of available
supplies and development of higher quality forages. It is being demonstrated
in India that by integrating leguminous fodder into the existing farming
systems, higher overall crop yields result which largely compensate for some
diversion of land to fodder.
28.       A notable bright spot in the Indlian dairy picture is the successful
experience of the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. (AMTL).
AMUL is centered on the formation and operation of hundreds of village milk
producers cooperatives (a typical member owns two buffalo and tills less than
1 ha). The village cooperatives are welded together into a cooperative union
which owns and operates facilities for milk and feed processing, collection
and distribution and provides its members with a full range of technical
services.  The union is responsible for setting milk prices and obligated to
buy milk in any quantity from members. Thus, the farmer is assured of year-
round outlet for his milk at fair prices. Members are provided with a package
of services which includes artificial insemination (AI) and routine veterinary
health coverage, sale of concentrate feed and fodder seed, and training. The
oustanding success of AMUL has encouraged GOI and a number of other states to
foster the establishment of similar programs in other parts of the countrv.
Status of Dairy Development in Madhya Pradesh
29.       Madhya Pradesh, land-locked in the center of India, is the countrv's
largest state in size and sixth in population.   It is almost the size of Spain
and its population of 42 million is slightly larger than that of the Philip-
pines. About 78Z of the population is engaged in agriculture, which in
1971/72 accounted for 52% of the total state income.    Of the 21 million ha
under cultivation, about 1.6 million ha are irrigated. The average annual
1961/62-1971/72 rate of agricultural growth was 2.0%.   The average size of
lholdings is 3.9 ha; 60% are 2 ha or less.
30.       In this agricultural environment, dairying, although a subsidiary
activity, provides many farmers with their only source of cash income. Dairy



-9-
animals are mainly low yielding nondescript native types. Crossbreeding of
cattle through artificial insemination (AI) was initiated in the mid-sixties,
but the effectiveness of the AI and health services has been limited due to
shortage of qualified personnel and facilities.
31.       The feed situation in the state is comparatively better than aver-
age for India, but there is, nevertheless, a shortage. There is a consider-
able scope for increasing production of high quality leguminous forages by
small farmers through the integration of these crops into existing farming
systems.
32.       Total Madhya Pradesh milk production is about 8 million liters per
day or about 190 grams per capita, well above the national average of 112
grams per capita per day. However, dairy processing and marketing are largely
undeveloped. Only about 40% of milk is consumed in fluid form. At present
the State Government dairy supplies about 10% of the urban milk market in the
project area. Of the remaining 90% of the urban milk market, up to 30% is
supplied by the small city producers who maintain herds of up to 20 cows in
the city; the remainder and bulk of milk supply comes from village producers.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The project was prepared by the staff of the Animal Husbandry and
Veterinary Services Department of Madhya Pradesh along guidelines from the
GOI Animal Husbandry Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Two Bank Group
missions assisted with preparation in February/March and April/May 1973. The
project was appraised in March/April 1974. Negotiations were held in
Washington from October 21 to October 25, 1974. The Borrower was represented
by Mr. T. P. Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, and Mr. S. N. Saigal,
Director, Department of Economic Affairs. The State of Madhya Pradesh was
represented by Mr. M. S. Chaudhary, Chief Secretary, and Mr. V. S. Krishna,
Joint Director, Department of Agriculture. ARC was represented by Mr. M. A.
Chidambaram, Managing Director . A report entitled "Appraisal of Madhya
Pradesh Dairy Development Project" (Report No. 522a-IN dated November 4, 1974)
is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III.
The Project Description
34.       The proposed IDA credit of US$16.4 million would assist in the
development of an integrated program for increasing milk production in
rural areas, involving about 160,000 farm families, most of whom farm
less than 2 ha or are landless, through a six-year program focusing on
quality crossbreeding, animal health, increased fodder production and
the development of milk collection, processing and marketing facilities.
Village cattle owners would form Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS), which
would in turn be grouped into three milk producers' unions of about 400 DCS
each following the AMUL pattern in Gujarat. Each union would own and



- 10 -
operate dairy and feed plants and would be capable of providing AI, animal
health, training and extension, milk collection and marketing services to
the DCS. In addition to the establishment of about 1,200 DCS and the three
unions, a Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation (MPDDC) would also
be formed to coordinate project implementation and produce exotic breeding
stock. An extensive training program for unions and DCS would also be
provided. About 30 farms of progressive owners would be improved for demons-
tration purposes in fodder production, crossbred rearing, and milking hygiene.
35.       At the village level, the DCS would be the focal point for the
project. It would be the center for milk collection and regular payments
to producers as well as sell balanced feed and provide artificial insemina-
tion services to members. It would also be instrumental in communicating
cooperative and technical information to members.
36.       The unions would in turn provide important services to the DCS.
The principal functions and responsibilities of each union would be to:
(a) organize and effect the implementation of the DCS; (b) assist the DCS
with organization, management, inspection and auditing; (c) establish and
supervise milk and cattle feed transportation; (d) process and market the
members' milk and operate the feed mills; (e) provide animal health and
operate bull farms for AI services; and (f) demonstrate improved mixed
farming, crossbred rearing, and fodder production techniques.
The Project Implementation
37.       The MPDDC would be responsible for the implementation and coordi-
nation of project activities and would play an essential role in the initial
establishment of village cooperative societies and milk producers' unions.
It would be organized under Articles approved by the Association 1/ witlh a
professional management staff reporting to a 15-member board of directors
consisting of representatives of government, banking and dairy farmers. It
would be a condition of effectiveness that MPDDC had been established, a
managing director of suitable qualifications had been appointed, and recruit-
ment of the Divisional Managers for Institutional Development, Livestock
Development, and Engineering had been completed. 2/ The MPDDC would be
responsible for recruiting the nucleus staff for each union and the spearhead
teams that would organize the DCS for each union. These spearhead teams
would concentrate on promotion, organization and operation of the DCS.
Once a sufficient number of DCS had been organized, a union would be estab-
lished as an independent entity; the nucleus union staff and its spearhead
team would be tansferred from MPDDC.   Assurances were obtained that GOI
and GOMP would each invest in MPDDC an initial equity contribution of at

least Rs. 275,000 and that they would provide additional equity capital as
required over the project period to ensure that MPDDC qualified for loans
from participating banks for project investments. GOMP also agreed to
provide redeemable equity capital to cover the first year's estimated start
up costs. 1/ Assurances were also obtained that beginning not later than
year six (1980) of the project, both GOI and GOMP would offer for sale
their shares in MPDDC to the unions until the unions had attained at least
75Z ownership. 2/
38.       To assist in the formation of DCS and unions along AMUL lines,
MPDDC would utilize the services of the National Dairy Development Board
(NDDB) which has over the past several years developed a respected and
commanding expertise in Indian dairy development, especially in the applica-
tion of the AMUL model. Consultants would also be employed by MPDDC to
assist the unions in dairy engineering, milk and milk products marketing,
dairy plant operations, mass-media communications, and fodder and livestock
production. It would be a condition of effectiveness that MPDDC had made
satisfactory arrangements for training of consultants and executive staff
and had recruited the consultants for dairy plant engineering, mass-media
communications, and fodder and livestock production. 3/
39.       For each of the three unions, a cadre of trained staff would be
assigned within MPDDC to concentrate on DCS implementation. Once at least
25 DCS had been registered, expected within the first few months, the union
would be legally constituted, staffed and capitalized. GOMP agreed that union
by-lawqs would be similar to AMUL's and subject to approval by the Associa-
tion. 41  GOI and GOMP   would together finance as equity 20% of union invest-
ments so as to ensure the unions' creditworthiness for participating bank
financing. GOMP would also provide additional redeemable equity capital
to cover the unions' initial operating deficits. Assurances for these
financial commitments were obtained from GOI and GOMP. 5/ Assurances were
also obtained that, beginning not later than the sixth project year, GOI
and GOMP would offer their shares of the unions for sale at par to member
DCS, until DCS had attained at least 75% ownership. 6/
40.       Each union would be free to set prices for its products and services,
and for milk procurement from members.7/ Union milk would be sold in the
urban centers and its price would be more in line with the free urban market

price than the subsidized prices of government dairies.   However, average
consumer prices are expected to decrease, particularly during the summer,
as private vendors no longer would be able to take advantage of a situation
of milk scarcity to raise prices. Village producers would be able to earn
more for milk sold to DCS and could therefore afford to retain for their
own use fodder now sold to urban producers. The present policy of govern-
ment dairies implies a subsidy of consumer milk prices that would come to
an end when the unions determine prices in their members' interest. The
only non-recoverable expenditures under the project are government start-
up grants to DCS and farmers which are justified to facilitate the establish-
ment of new cooperative organizations and the spread of proven crossbreeding
technology to rural areas. Loan components are all recoverable at commercial
interest rates. Farm income and sale of milk are not taxed, but the Govern-
ment would earn sales tax on processed milk products, and income taxes from
MPDDC and unions. After-tax profits of the unions would be paid back to
the DCS in the form of bonuses and dividends. A portion would also be used
to help finance dairy and feed plant expansion.
41.       The most significant risk facing the project is the task of creat-
ing DCS and unions to establish a new cooperative-controlled production and
marketing channel for the increased supplies of rurally produced milk. NDDB's
experience in replicating the AMUTL pattern in Gujarat and other parts of
the country indicates that human responses to such a program are varied but
that the obstacles, though many, are surmountable. Training and extension
are the keys to success. Therefore, under the project, an intensive program
of staff development, training and extension would be provided. Three
Union Training Centers (UTC) would be establislhed to train dairy farmers,
DCS staff, union staff and board members in AI4UL concepts. Instruction to
DCS staff would also include artific'ial insemination, milk testing, basic
record keeping, and cooperative principles. About 50 village extension
workers for each union would be provided under the pro-ect.   Their function
would be to conduct an intensive extenision effort to assist dairy far;ners
in the application of basic principles of animal husbandry, milk hygienie,
crossbred feeding, fodder production and mixed farm management. Assurances
were obtained from GO'IP that project funds for training and extension
activities would be channelled through MPDDC to the unions quarterly based
upon plans prepared by the unions. 11
/2.       The DCS, the basic organizational unit to be established under the
project, would cach be managed by a committee of nine members, headed by an
elected chairman who would also be eligible to be elected to the Union Board
of Directors.   'he committee would appoint a secretarv who would be responsi-
ble for day to day running of the DCS. Each DCS would also have one to four
helpers to assist the secretary.
1/   See MPA, Section 2.10.



- 13 -
43.       Each DCS would be capitalized by share purchases by members and
entrance fees. For each newly formed DCS, GOMP agreed to contribute as
grants initial equipment for milk testing, first-aid and artificial insemi-
nation and estimated operating deficits in the initial operating period. 1/
These grants are available elsewhere in India where GOI promotes producers
cooperatives, including the AMUL scheme and are essential in bringing about
the rapid transformation in the rural institutional farming and dairying
system that the AMUL approach implies. The typical DCS should break even
within three years and earn surpluses thereafter, which would be used
to pay milk bonuses to farmers and to purchase shares in the union.
44.       The animal health activities financed under the project would be
carried out by the union. Each union would operate mobile veterinary units
(1 unit for every 35 DCS) involving a vehicle equipped with animal health
and vaccination kits and staffed by a veterinarian and trained assistant
which would visit the DCS weekly without charge. Emergency service would
be available on call for a reasonable fee.
Project Cost and Financing
45.       The total project cost is about US$31 million equivalent (including
duties and taxes) of which the foreign exchange component is about 24% or
US$7.5 million. Included in the project costs are initial operating defi-
cits, working capital, and calf rearing subsidies. These costs, of approxi-
mately US$6 million, would be borne by GOI and GOMP and are necessary to
assure a sound financial start for the project and to provide incentive
for participation by farmers. A breakdown of the cost components is in
Annex III.
46.       The proposed IDA credit of US$16.4 million would cover 51% of total
project costs including all of foreign exchange expenditures and 37% of lo-
cal costs. The remaining 49% would be financed by GOI (19%), GOMP (16%),
ARC and participating banks (13%) and farmers (1%).
47.       The IDA proceeds under the project would be applied as follows:
(a)  US$5.8 million  -   Equipment for feed mills and dairy
processing plants.
(b)  US$8.2 million  -   Other equipment and civil works for
unions, DCS and MPDDC.
(c)  US$0.12 million  -  Exotic purebred cattle and frozen
semen for MPDDC and unions.
1/   See MPA, Section 2.11(b).



- 14 -
(d)  US$1.4 million   -  Union Training Centers and extension
programs.
(e)  US$0.88 million  -  Consultant's services.
48.       IDA funds for the investments in dairy plants, feed mills and
MPDDC (except for imported cattle and semen), would be channelled from GOI
to ARC and local banks. ARC would refinance loans by banks to MPDDC and
unions for project investments. The IDA proceeds for imported purebred
cattle and semen and consultants and training would be channelled by GOI
through GOMP to MPDDC. Relending arrangements and terms are specified in
Annex III. The lending rates under the project are in line with prevailing
interest rates, and the interest spreads are reasonable in relation to the
risk element involved, and the cost of appraisal and supervision of indivi-
dual loans.
49.       Subsequent to project appraisal and pursuant to IDA's suggestion,
GOMP commenced with the training of project personnel at NDDB. By the time
of negotiations a substantial start on the project training program had
been achieved, and it is proposed to provide retroactive finance under the
credit for such training expenditures from June, 1974, up to a maximum
amount of US$50,000.
Procurement and Disbursement
50.       Materials and equipment valued at US$12.3 million would be procured
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Association's Guidelines. Domestic suppliers would be accorded the usual
preference of 15% or the rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. Exotic
dairy heifers, bulls, and frozen semen (US$0.12 million) would be procured
on the basis of price quotations from at least three countries free from
foot and mouth disease where suitable animals are available.
51.       Other equipment items valued at US$5.6 million would be unsuitable
for international bidding. These include minor items such as electrical
installations, factory fittings, furniture, and farm equipment. They would
be purchased as needed over six years to coincide with the phasing of opera-
tions and would require service and spare parts to be readily available
locally.
52.       Buildings and civil works (valued at about US$4.8 million) for the
MPDDC, union dairies and health support program would not be attractive to
international bidders. These facilities would be dispersed geographically
and over time. Contracts would be comparatively small and bulking of them
would not be practical. The facilities would be constructed by local con-
tractors. Civil works would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are
satisfactory.



- 15 -
53.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against the
full c.i.f. costs of imported equipment, cattle and semen, and the ex-
factory cost of local equipment bid internationally; against the full costs
of expenditures by MPDDC for technical and management services and overseas
fellowships; against 70% of expenditures on locally procured equipment and
civil works, including engineering; and against 80% of expenditures on
union training centers and extension programs.
Economic Benefits
54.       The project would provide important economic and social benefits.
The direct economic benefit of the project will be the increased production
of milk, estimated at 285,000 tons per year by year ten. Some 160,000 farm-
ing households, or approximately 0.9 million people, would benefit by having
a raised standard of living and increased cash family income. The project's
establishment of 1200 DCS, three unions and MPDDC would provide employment for
about 6,200 as well as support a milk transport service, consisting largely
of owner-operators. The AMUL experience indicates that significant social
benefits at the village level would also be derived under the project par-
ticularly after the village cooperative dairy societies become firmly estab-
lished with a regular net annual surplus of funds. Such funds would most
likely be used to augment or initiate village development schemes involving
education, health, family planning, minor public works and infrastructure.
A further unquantifiable benefit to the village would accrue from improved
nutrition which would result from increased intake of milk particularly by
children and infants. The benefits which would accrue to consumers would
come from an improvement in nutrition as a result of increased availability
of whole pasteurized milk in the urban areas. Also, as the share of hygienic
pasteurized milk to raw milk increases, the risk of milk born diseases such
as TB, brucellosis and gastrointestinal infections (particularly with infants)
will decrease greatly. Based on the quantified incremental costs and bene-
fits, the economic rate of return to the project is about 34%. A sensitivity
analysis to test the effect of slower formation of successful DCS assuming
that plant investments are not delayed shows that if successful DCS can
only be formed at half the rate envisaged under the project, the expected
rate of return is 27%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the
Agricultural Refinance Corporation, the draft Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the State of Madhya Pradesh, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d), of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.

56.       The features of the draft agreements of special interest are
described in paragraphs 37 through 44 of this report.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are below.
The level of disbursements was $368 million in FY74 or 83% of Bank Group
commitments in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of $1,112 million as of
October 31,   1974, corresponds roughly to commitments over the preceding
24-month period and reflects the lead time which would be expected giren the
mix of fast and slow disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 6.83  Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$400. million loan of June 3, 1970; Closing Date:
September 30, 1974
Ln. No. 789   Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Ln. No. 902   Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June b, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. The undisbursed balance! of
US$1.2 million for Loan 683-IN as of the closing date of September 30, 1974, has
been cancelled; Loan 789-IN is fully committed; and disbursements under Loan
902-IN are ahead of schedule. An eleventh loan to ICICI is tentatively
scheduled for Board presentation in July 1975.
Ln. No. 614   Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1?7L
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high-yielding varieties. The Corporation is working
efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets. Implementation problems over processing plant
construction and land-leveling have been resolved although, as a result of
these delays, an extension of the closing date by two years is proposed.
Expansion of an existing processing plant is in progress, and tenders for a
new plant are under preparation. Large-scale land-leveling demonstrations have
stimulate(i demand for such work and orders are to be placed shortly by con-
tractors for imported machinery.
Cr. No. 176   Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closirng Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam.   The
project a:Lso includes field channel construction, land-leveling, drainage

works and roads, and a program to support agricultural development.   The
project will be completed about two years behind schedule because o:f delays
in dam construction.  The agricultural components of the project are also
behind schedule.  Some of the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project before major investments have been made.  These will
not affect the economic justification of the project. Further delays have
occurred as a result of material shortages. The Government has recently taken
action to make more material available.
Cr. No. 268   Pochampad Irrigation: US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha.  It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads. Until
mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with construction
and credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute shortages of
construction materials, especially explosives for the canal excavation, have
hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main canals is now likely
to fall more than one year behind schedule, which is likely to delay the
introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area. Land development
is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water availability in
the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the credit operation
for land development and has requested IDA financing for a Command Area
Development Project, to be implemented by a Central Authority for all
farmers in need of land development.
Cr. No. 191   Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Cr. No. 203   Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975

November 29, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977



ANNEX II
Page 5
The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million.
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization equipment only,
all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term
credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments
as imported tractors, mi.nor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of
these credits started slowly. So far as the minor irrigation components were
concerned, the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional requirements,
in particular the introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending
terms and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing ground-
water availability.  These constraints h-ave been overcome and disbursements are
on schedule. Tractor procurement has been delayed following the substantial
change in bDth the supply and demand situations since the projects were
originally appraised.  Those credits which have tractor components have been
amended to aermit the financing of indigenously Tnanufactured tractors as well
as imported tractors. Tractor procurement is now in progress on that basis.
Some funds earmarked for tractors have been reallocated to minor irrigation
components.
Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971; Closing
Date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat
belt, comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and 10
silos (200,000 tons capacity) and an all-India grain storage study. Warehouse
construction is about 75% complete. The Government Food Ministry has selected
a local research institute to conduct the study. Administrative problems,
substantial cost increases, and technical difficulties in the selection of silo
sites have ham,pered the execution of the silo component. A supervision mission
has recently assessed the situation and will shortly recommend appropriate action.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apples Processing and Marketing; US$13 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 197T
This project has beern designed to promote the development of apple
production :i.n Himachal Pradesh and comprises rcads, cold storage, juice pro-
cessing, and marketing.  This credit was declared effective on SeptemTber 26, 1974.
Cr. NIo. 21!1  Telecommunications IV; US$7V.C million credit of May i, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Cr. No. 403    Telecomnmunications V; US$hC.0 mil'lion credit of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Both orojects are continuations of Telecommunications III.   Tele-
commimications IV has been designed to support the telecommunications expansion
program over the last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74).   Procurement
action for delivery of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed.
Production problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 mcnths.  However, production has now picked up and as of October 31, 19741,
US$54.9miliioJn had been disbursed under the credit.   Telecommunications V was
declared effective on July 30, 1973, and procurement procedures, after a slow
start, are nlow under way.

Cr. No. 242    Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date:  September 30, 1975
Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million ,credit of May 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1577
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project
financed by Loan 416-IN, has been designed to assist in financing tha purchase
of equipmenit and materials required to develop a power transmission prograr- in
nine states under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because
of problem..i associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international
bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but all
contract awards have now been made. Power Transmission III became effective
on October 10, 1973, and specification and tendering procedures are progressing.
Tenders received so far indicate substantial cost overruns.
Cr. No. 264t   Cochin II Fertilizer; US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Cr. No. 279    Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Cr. No. 357    Nangal Fertilizer Expansion Project; US$58.0 million credit of
February 9, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion; US$50.0 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the
expansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is
now proceeding about 21 months behind schedule due, in large part, to labor
and procurement difficulties. Procurement problems have been largely overcome
and most of the equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin port. Another
factor which has contributed to the delay has been technical problems in the
commissioning of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportionate
amount of management attention.  Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant
Operations Improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these
problems; the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis
and procurement has been initiated. The engineering design for the Gorakhpur
project is well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been ordered.
Although delivery of some equipment may take longer than forecast during
appraisal, the project is progressing without serious difficulties, and
disbursements are expected to be complete by the March 1975 closing date.
Engineering work and procurement for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are
proceeding satisfactorily. The Trombay IV Credit was signed on June 19, 1974,
and was declared effective on August 21, 1974.

Procurement
Arrangements:      The major portion (about US$12.3 million) of materials
and equipment required for milk processing and feed mill
facilities would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding with domestic bidders accorded the
normal preference of 15 percent or customs duty whichever
is the lower. For dairy heifers, bulls, and frozen semen
(US$0.12 million), procurement would be on the basis of
price quotations from suppliers in at least three coun-
tries. The remaining items such as furniture, and minor
equipment (US$5.6 million) would be procured locally
due to small amounts involved, the piece-meal nature
of procurement, and in some cases the need to maintain
standardization witlh existing items and local maintenance
capabilities. As civil works for the construction of
milk processing plants, feed mills, and buildings would
be dispersed geographically and over time, they woula
be too small to attract international bidders, and
would be contracted locally pursuant to contracts
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertized
locally and in accordance with local procedures, which
are satisfactory (US$4.8 million).
Consultants and      Specialists would be contracted to assist MPDDC with:
Technical          (a)  dairy plant engineering; (b) training of staff in
Assistance:        dairy processing plant operation, process monitoring,
and quality control; (c) mass-media communications;
(d) marketing and determination of appropriate product
mix; (e) fodder/livestock expertise and establishment
of demonstration farms. US$0.88 million would be pro-
vided under the credit for these services.
Rate of Return:      34% economic rate of return.
Appraisal Report:    No. 522a-IN dated November 4, 1974
