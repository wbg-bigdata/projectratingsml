MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Dairying in India
i.        This project in Madhya Pradesh will contribute to the development
of Indian agriculture, which accounts for about 40% of Indian GNP and employs
70% of the total work force. Although Government of India's (GOI) emphasis
in the sector in recent years has been to increase the output of foodgrains,
it is attempting to diversify, where appropriate, with special attention to
the dairy sub-sector. Over the past two decades there has been a marked
decline in per capita consumption of milk, a primary source of animal
protein for the bulk of the population. Efforts are now being made to in-
crease milk production from 21 million tons in 1972 to 30 million by 1979.
The project and its companion, the Rajasthan Dairy Development Project,
appraised at the same time, are the third and second of a series designed
to make a significant contribution towards this target. The first was the
Karnataka Dairy Development Project presented on June 13, 1974.
ii.       A large proportion of the world's bovine population is in India,
which has 17% of the world's cattle and 50% of its buffalo. However, indig-
enous varieties produce very low milk yields. Their main contribution has
been to provide draft power and to support a small livestock industry account-
ing for 14% of the total agricultural sector's share of GNP and about 5% of
total exports. To increase milk production significantly, a large-scale
effort to develop higher yielding animals and expansion of animal health care
and breeding facilities are required.
iii.      Crossbreeding of indigenous cattle with exotic varieties to produce
higher yielding dairy cattle has been conducted in India for many years, so far
with only limited success. With one rather notable exception, it has not been
accompanied by adequate institutional support, effective organization of small
and marginal farmers (who produce most of the milk) into economically viable
units, development of adequate milk collection, processing and marketing. Nor
has there been adequate provision of animal health care and technical services
to farmers. Few farmers use their land principally for dairy production, which
is essentially a subsidiary farm activity. If a significant increase in milk
production is to be achieved, additional feed must be made available or more of
the available feed must be reserved for high producing animals. The demand for
cereal grains as human food and the favorable export position of oilseeds and
oilcake preclude any significant increase in the supply of concentrate feed for
livestock. It is, therefore, important to develop animal production systems
which will result in more efficient use of available supplies and encourage
development of higher quality forages where these are now grown. However, by
integrating leguminous fodder into the existing farming systems, higher overall
crop yields would result which would largely compensate for some diversion of
land to fodder.



.. ii -
V-z.      A notable bright spot irT the Indian dairy picture is the successful
experience over the past 25 years, of the Kaira District Cooperative Milk
Producers Union Ltd (AMTUL).  AMUL is centered on the formation and operation
ox hundreds of village milk producers cooperatives (a typical member owns two
Zallov and tills less than 1 ha), The village cooperatives are welded to-
Iether into a cooperative Union wiich owns and operates facilities for milk
azd feeed processing, collection ard distribution and provides its members
Tritn a full range of technical services. The Union is responsible for setting
milk prices and obligated to buy milk in any quantity from members.  Thus,
thbe farmer is assured of year round outlet for his milk at fair prices. Mem-
bers are provided with a package of services which includes artificial insemi-
nation (AI) and routine veterinary health coverage, sale of concentrate
£eed and fodder seed, and training. The outstanding success of AMUL has
encouraged GOI and several states to foster the establishment of similar
?rograms in other parts of the country.
Sztws of Dairy Development in Madhya Pradesh
Madhya Pradesh, land-locked in the center of India, is the
cf4"ntryls largest state in size but among the smallest six in population.
To is about the size of Italv and its population of 42 million is slightly
-re than that of the Philippines.  About 78% of the population is engaged
ln agriculture, which in 1971/72 accounted for 52% of total state income.
O3 the 21 million ha. under cultivation, about 1.6 million ha. are irrigated.
-mc annual 1962/63-1971/72 rate of agricultural growth during the period was
1,0%. The average size of holding; is 3.9 ha.; 60% are 2 ha. or less.
vi.       In this agricultural env,ironment dairying, although a subsidiary
activity, provides many farmers with their only source of cash income.
Dairy animals are mainly low yield:ng nondescript native types.  Cross-
bneeding of cattle through Al was -nitiated in the mid-sixties, but the
e£fectiveness of the Al and health services has been limited due to shortage
of qualified personnel and facilities.
vii.      The feed situation in the state is comparatively better than average
for 7ndia, but there is, nevertheless, a shortage. There is considerable scope
Jor increasing production of high quality leguminous forages by small farmers
0h7o"igh the integration of these crops into existing farming systems.
vi4i.     Total Madhya Pradesh milk production is about 8 million liters per
day or about 190 grams per capita, well above the national average of 112
,grams per capita per day. However, dairy processing and marketing are
largely undeveloped, therefore, village milk is mostly converted into ghee
aznd on'ly about 40% of the milk is consumed in fluid form. The only dairy
plants (Government owned) in the project districts can process only 4% of
the total milk production in those listricts.
T Projet D
The proposed IDA credit of US$16 million would assist in the develop-
mnat of an integrated program for itncreasing milk production in rural areas,



- iii -
involving about 160,000 farm families, most of whom farm less than 2 ha or are
landless, through a six-year program focusing on quality crossbreeding, animal
health, increased fodder production and the development of milk collection,
processing and marketing facilities. Village cattle owners would form Dairy
Cooperative Societies (DCS), which would in turn be grouped into three milk
producers' unions following the AMUL pattern in Gujarat. Each union would
own and operate dairy and feed plants and would be capable of providing At,
animal health, training and extension, milk collection and marketing services
to the DCS. In addition to the establishment of about 1,200 DCS and the
unions, a Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation (MPDDC) would also be
formed to coordinate project implementation and produce purebred exotic breed-
ing stock. An extensive training program would also be provided. Each union
would also operate an extension service involving one trained extension
worker for ten DCS. Consultant services would be provided to assist MPDDC
in dairy engineering and plant construction, marketing of milk and dairy
products, milk processing plant operation, the organization of DCS and fodder/
animal production. About 30 demonstration farms involving fodder production
and crossbred rearing would be established.
The Project Implementation
x.        The MPDDC would be the main body for implementation and coordina-
tion of project activities and would play an essential role in the initial
establishment of dairy cooperative societies and milk producers' unions.
MPDDC would build dairy plants and other facilities under the project for the
Unions which would operate them once they are adequately capitalized and
staffed and a sufficient number of DCS's organized.
xi.       MPDDC would engage the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to
help in recruitment, training and field supervision of each spearhead team
and the union staff. The NDDB would also assist MPDDC in design and cons-
truction of milk and feed plants and carry out marketing studies to deter-
mine plant product mix capacities, prepare specifications for requesting
construction bids, and supervise construction.
xii.      Total estimated project cost is US$31.2 million equivalent includ-
ing duties and taxes and foreign exchange component of US$7.5 million is
about 25%. The proposed IDA credit of US$16.4 million would cover 52%
of total project cost. The remaining 49% would be financed by GOI (19%),
GOMP (16%), ARC and participating banks (12%) and farmers (1%). IDA funds
would be channelled in two ways. (i) Credit funds for union and MPDDC
investments in facilities, totalling US$13.65 million, would be made avail-
able by GOI to the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) repayable over
15 years at 7.5% annual interest, minimum. GOI would bear the exchange risk.
ARC would in turn on-lend the funds to participating banks at a minimum
annual interest rate of 8%. The banks would lend to MPDDC and the unions
at 11% per annum minimum. Loans to the unions and MPDDC would have upto 6
years of grace and repayment over 9 years. Repayments to ARC would be scheduled
to coincide with those by the unions and MPDDC to the banks. The interest
rates would be in line with prevailing interest rates, and the margins



- ivr -
reasonable in relation to the need for appraisal and supervision of indivi-
dual loans. (ii) US$2.75 million for consultants, importation of exotic
cattle, the union training centers and extension programs, would be channelled
through GOI to GOMP.
xiii.     Materials and equipment valued at US$12.3 million or 39% of total
project cost would be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the IDA Guidelines. Domestic suppliers would be
accorded the usual preference of 15% or the rate of customs duty, whichever is
lower. Procurement of imported exotic dairy heifers, bulls, and frozen semen
(US$0.2 million) would be by requesting quotations from at least three coun-
tries free from foot and mouth disease where suitable animals are available.
xiv.      Other equipment valued at US$5.6 million would be procured locally due
to the small sizes of individual items and the time spread.
xv.       Buildings and civil works (valued at about US$4.8 million) for the
MPDDC farm, union dairies and feed mills would be dispersed in time and place
and would be unsuitable for international bidding. They would be constructed
by local contractors after local competitive bidding.
xvi.      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against the full
c.i.f. costs of imported equipment and materials and the ex-factory cost of
local equipment bid internationally; against the full c.i.f. costs of imported
cattle and semen; against the full ex,penditures for consultant services and
fellowships; against 70% of expenditures on locally procured equipment and civil
works; and against 80% of the cost of the union training centres and the exten-
sion programs.
Economic Benefits
xvii.     The project would provide a number of important economic and social
benefits. The direct economic benefii: would be the increased production of
milk, estimated at 285,000 tons/year by year ten (10% of state total). Some
160,000 farming households, or approxiLmately 0.9 million people, would benefit
by raising of their standard of living and providing increased cash family
income. The project's establishment of 1,200 DCS, three unions and MPDDC
would provide employment for about 6,200 as well as supporting a milk trans-
port service, consisting largely of 70 owner-operators. Consumers would also
benefit from better milk supply. Milk borne diseases, such as TB, would
decrease significantly. Based on the quantified incremental costs and benefits,
the economic rate of return of the project is about 34%.

MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has asked IDA to help finance a third
dairy development project, this one in the State of Madhya Pradesh. 1/ The
project was prepared by the staff of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Services Department in Madhya Pradesh along guidelines from the GOI Animal
Husbandry Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Two Bank Group missions
assisted with preparation in February/March and April/May 1973.
1.02      Bank Group finance for agricultural projects in India totals about
US$714 million up to June 30, 1974.  Dairy development would help GOI imple-
ment its plans to diversify agriculture and provide increased emphasis on an
important food subsector which has so far received relatively little attention.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
India from March - April 1974 comprising Messrs. C. Wolffelt, A. Seth (IDA)
and A. Pursell, C. Percival and J. D. von Pischke (consultants). Mr. N. Krafft
(IDA) also contributed to the report.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Madhya Pradesh is in the center of India and is its largest state
with an area of 44 million ha (10% of India's total) and a population of 42
million (8% of India's total). The capital is Bhopal with a population of
400,000. The state lies under the tropic of Cancer, its elevation ranges from
500 ft. to 2,000 ft. and the rainfall from 1,000 mm to 1,800 mm (June-September
monsoon). It can be divided into six physical regions of which the Malwa
Plateau (Project area) is the most important agriculturally.
Agriculture
2.02      About 78% of the population is engaged in agriculture.  Approximately
21 million ha (47% is under cultivation and 14 million ha (37%) is covered by
forest. About 1.6 million ha (8%) is irrigated. Irrigated crops include
rice, wheat, barley, sugarcane, mustard and fodder crops (alfalfa and berseem).
1/   The first dairy development project for the state of Karnataka was approv-
ed by IDA on June 13, 1974 (Report 431a-IN of May 21, 1974). The second,
for the state of Rajasthan, is presented as a companion to this project
for Madhya Pradesh.



-2-
Rice, wheat, jowar (sorghum) and gram are the most important crops; wheat is
largely grown as a dry (rabi) crop and rice and gram during the kharif season.
The annual rate of agricultural growth during 1962/63 to 1970/71 was 2%. The
average holding is 3.9 ha.
B. The Da:Lrv Subsector -
The AMUL Model
2.03      The Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. (AMUL),
headquartered at Anand in Gujarat: State, is a model for dairy development
well adapted to India. AMUL is centered on the formation of hundreds of vil-
lage milk producers' cooperatives welded together into a cooperative Union
which owns and operates its own rilk and feed processing, collection and dis-
tribution facilities. The Union now numbers about 225,000 families in 785
village cooperatives and processes about 150 million 1 annually. The Union
is governed by a farmer-elected Board and operated by hired market-oriented
managers responsible for setting milk prices. AMUL members are provided
with a package of services, including veterinary health coverage and training
facilities, financed by the Union from milk levies, and concentrate feed and
fodder seed paid for by producers through deductions from their milk sales.
Five similar Unions have been formed in Gujarat and were recently amalgamated
into a Federation. The success of AMUL has encouraged GOI and several states
to promote similar programs in other parts of the country. (Annex 3)
National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)
2.04      NDDB was registered in 1965 to step up planning and execution of
dairy develoPment on a national scale. It is located in Anand, Gujarat, and
its close association with AMUL has enabled it to build up the most authori-
tative expertise in India on dairy technology and the AMUL model.
Livestock and Breeds
2.05      The present bovine population of Madhya Pradesh is about 26 million
cattle (15% of India's total) and 6 million buffalo (11% of India's total).
Respectively, 8.1 and 2.5 million represent the breedable milking stock.
Around 50% of these are in milk. Most cattle do not conform to any specific
breed. Milk production varies considerably with breeds, feeding and manage-
ment practices; it averages about 500 1/lactation for cows and 800 1/lacta-
tion for buffalo. Crossbreeding with exotic purebreds mainly Jersey was
successfully initiated in the mid-sixties on a limited scale through the
State Animal Husbandry Department. There are now seven cattle breeding farms
in the state producing pedigree bulls of the main breeds only one maintains
Jersey bulls.
1/   The Madhya Pradesh dairy subsector is described in Annex 1.



-3-
Feeds and Feeding
2.06      The most common cattle feeds are byproducts of agricultural crops,
cultivated fodders, perennial pasture grasses and concentrates. Increased
dairy herds and milk production under the project (Annex 3) depend on an
adequate supply of high quality forage and balanced premixed feed (Annex 1).
GOMP measures to encourage fodder production include demonstration farms for
improved pastures and better management, seed multi-plication farms, distribu-
tion of hybrid napier seedlings, loans and grants for pasture improvement and
for fencing of pasture land and subsidies for fodder seed and chaffcutters.
However, the largest scope for increased production of high quality forage
is by integration of these fodder crops into existing irrigated farms by
effective extension work.
2.07      In 1971-72 Madhya Pradesh produced 11.3 million tons of foodgrains
(11% of India's total) equivalent to about 270 kg yearly per capita (India
average: 190) (Annex 1). This agricultural production comes mostly from
western Madhya Pradesh where the project would be sited (3.01). This would
assure the supply of the balanced feed ingredients required under the project.
By year ten, the incremental foodgrain requirements would only represent
about 0.3% of total state production.
2.08      The marginal productivity of a crossbreed would be about 1 1 of
milk per kg. of balanced feed (0.25 kg. foodgrain ingredient). The nutritive
value of 1 1 of milk would be about 35 g. protein and 750 calories, comparable
to 25 g. protein and 850 calories for 0.25 kg. foodgrain (as meal). At the
village level the cost of milk is about Rs 1 per 1 and the cost of 0.25 kg.
of foodgrain only about Rs 0.25; but milk has a higher content of minerals
(Ca) and a broader spectrum of vitamins (A, B2, C, D). GOI rightly considers
the trade off fully justified in view of the need for increasing the avail-
ability of milk in fluid or powdered form to the Indian population not only
to improve the diet of infants but also for the large low-income urban popula-
tion whose average daily intake of milk and milk products is less than 100 g.
Milk and milk products provide the only acceptable source of animal protein
for the large vegetarian segment of the population.
Milk Production
2.09      Dairying in Madhya Pradesh is largely a subsidiary activity to crop
farming though in many instances it provides a daily cash income. Over
80% of the cows and buffalo are kept in villages.  The average size herd
is 2 - 3 breedable head per family. Milk producers are of 3 categories:
(a) the landless who represent 15% of the rural population, keep one to
two animals and purchase all feeds and fodders; (b) the mixed farmer
(cropping and livestock) whose main income is from sale of crops surplus
to household needs, to whom dairying is a sideline which utilizes crop by-
products. He may use a small area of his land for growing fodder (alfalfa
and berseem) purchasing small amounts of concentrate, herd size is about two
to five animals; (c) the urban milk producer with herds up to 20 head, who
purchases all the feed and fodder and buys cows at peak production, selling



them when dry. Total milk production in the state is about 8 million 1/day
equivalent to about 190 grams/capita, well above the national average of
1.10/115. The urban centers are the natural markets for village milk, but
lack of adequate transportation compel distant villagers to convert most of
that surplus into ghee (butter oil), wasting some of the skimmed milk. Only
about 40% of the milk is consuimed as fluid.
2.10      Madhya Pradesh has an undeveloped dairy processing and marketing
structure resulting in severe shortage in the urban centers during the lean
season with marked price escalations. The first milk processing plant was -
established by GOMP in Bhopal in 1958. Government now operates a total of
38 plants (mostly small dairies) with a capacity less than 2% of the total
state milk production.
Government Services, Research, Education
2.11      Government services for animal health and livestock development
are provided by the GOMP Animal Husbandry Department. It operates 525
Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, and 22 AI centers. Due to lack of
qualified personnel and tzansportati m, Al services are not very effective
and less than 25% of the semein produced is utilized. Endemic cattle diseases
as elsewhere in India, 2_e rwinerpect foot and mouth, blackquarter, hemorra-
gic septicaemia and anthrax. Vaccines are produced in the Biological Produc-
tion Institute of Mhow which will be expanded under the Fifth Plan. The
state has a Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at Jabalpur and
at Mhow; both are constituent colleges of the Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural
University.
C. Government ?olicies
2.12      The policies followed by the GOMP in the dairy subsector are essen-
tially those established by the GOI in its Five-year plans. Allocations for
the dairy subsector in the first three development plans were inadequate.
GOI objectives in the Fourth and current Fifth Plan are to attain food grain
self-sufficiency and to diversify agricultural production. Within the live-
stock sector, dairy development has been given greatest emphasis in GOI's 
Fifth Plan since milk and milk products provide the primary source of animal I"
protein for the large vegeterian segment of the population. The daily per
capita availability has however fallen from 120 (1970) to 112 g. (1973). GOI
plans for dairy development have been stimulated by the successful AMUL experi-
ence and in the Fifth five-year Plar., GOI is encouraging the AMUL model as the
basic means to increase milk production. In addition, animal production, health
and AI facilities are proposed to be improved at state level and more emphasis
placed on increasing crossbred cattle. GOI would provide a crossbred calf
subsidy of Rs 200 per head, in the form of pre-mixed calf feed, to encourage
farmers to adopt better feeding practices and so avoid losses of valuable
crossbred heifers due to malnutrition.

D. Agricultural Credit
2.13      Institutional agricultural credit is provided directly by cooper-
ative banks, commercial banks and GOI indirectly through the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) and the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) (Annex 2).
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
2.14      ARC is an intermediary channel for 15 current IBRD/IDA credit
projects. 1/ It was established in 1963 as a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) to provide the on-lending agricultural credit institutions
with a supplemental source of medium and long-term finance. With the RBI
it sponsors orientation and traini ng programs for management and technical
staff of banking institutions. Its expanding technical division assists
banks in appraising the techno-economical feasibility of projects and super-
vision of ongoing schemes.
Cooperative Banks
2.15      The cooperative banking system is the villager's most important
source of institutional credit. The Madhya Pradesh Cooperative Banks, supply
short and medium-term loans. The state Apex Cooperative Bank has a membership
of about 108, of which there are 43 Central Cooperative Banks (CCB). Each
CCB is a federation of about 200-300 primary credit societies. The State
Cooperative Land Development Bank, which supplies long-term credit, is a
federation of 44 Primary Land Development Banks (PLDB), at least one for each
district. LDB lending has been about Rs 100 M to 125 M annually, with almost
90% being for minor irrigation (wells and pumpsets). Credit needs for minor
irrigation in Madhya Pradesh in general and the project area in particular
have been assessed under the Madhya Pradesh agricultural credit project (391-
IN) and ARC refinance is available to meet these needs. Interest rates to the
ultimate borrower now range from 11-13% per annum. The on-lending institu-
tions generally receive a spread of 2-3%. LDB's have been plagued with
problems of low recoveries and overdues partially related to droughts and
crop failures but largely due to inefficient management. These problems in
turn affect their ability to lend.
Commercial Banks
2.16      Since 1969 commercial banks have increased their role in providing
institutional rural credit. Designated banks were charged with assessing
local resources and credit needs, mobili2ong capital and improving rural
credit supply, in specific districts and rehabilitation of weak credit
societies. Experience to date has been modest. Commercial banks are never-
theless attempting to expand into agricultural operations based on sound
lending principles with good technical support. Prevailing interest rates
are 11-13% per annum.
1/   Full details of ARC's organization and financial operations are given in
Annex 4 of the Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Appraisal Report No.

III. TH_ PROJECT AREAS
General Description
The project would be in western Madhya Pradesh, in the milksheds
around the district capitals of Bhopal, Indore, Ratlam and Ujjain involving
selected areas of the districts of Hoshangabad, Raisen, Bhopal Sehore, Dewas,
Indore, Ujjain, Ratlam and Dahr, located mostly on the Malwa plateau. The
Malwa plateau has considerable potential for growing feed and forage and for.
.,.s, dairy livestock development. The four district capitals are important markets
for fluid milk and dairy products. These districts are not involved in any
other on-going or proposed IDA project except as mentioned in para. 2.15.
3.02      The June-September monsoon accounts for most of the rain varying
from about 700 mm (Indore) to 1,630 mm (Hoshangabad) in the project area.
Temperature variations are marked:  the minimum temperature is about 5°C
w3thnmaximur  over 40C in summer (March - June).  Total rural population
in the project districts is about 4.4 million, distributed between 10,300
villages, each of about 80 households.
3.03      The project districts cover approximately 5.8 million ha, (13% of
the state) 3.2 million ha (55%) under cultivation of which 0.1 million ha
f3%.) is under irrigation. The average holding is 4 ha, with 60% of less
than 2 ha.  The breedable stock is about 1.0 million cows and 0.5 million
buffalo.  The average household owns about 1.6 cows and 0.8 buffalo.
Status of Dairy Development
2'.114   Approximately one fourth of the facilities operated by the Depart-
ment of Animal Husbandry (2.11) for animal health services are located in
the project districts.  However due to shortage of trained staff and poor
communications the services lack effectiveness. The milk production in the
area is estimated at 1.1 million 1/day with capacity for processing only
aoout 4% of this total in five plants. There are about 3,000 crossbreds in
the project districts.  The Danish Project Assistance Program will furnish
a frozen semen bank at Indore and a bull breeding farm at Bhopal.
Mi'Lk Marketing
3,05      In Madhya Pradesh, as in most of India, there are three main channels
for milk supply to the urban market: (i) traditional village agents, (ii)
citv producers; (iii) cooperative sector (3.08). The traditional village
agent, acting as a collector/middleman for private vendors in the cities is
the main supplier. The supply from city producers is also significant re-
presenting about 20% - 30% of the market. There are 12,000 cows and buffalo
in Bhopal.
3.06      Milk prices in Madhya Pradesh are not controlled and the urban
market price for raw milk varies according to type and season from about



Rs 1.50 to 2.50 per 1. GOMP dairies market pasteurized milk in 1/2 1 bottles
at significantly lower prices: Rs 1.70 per 1 of 3.2% fat (Bhopal), this
subsidy does not permit paying fair prices to the village producers, therefore,
procurement volume is low and operating losses result from low throughput.
Accordingly, the GOMP milk schemes in Bhopal and Indore accommodate only about
10% of the urban demand (presently 110,000 1/day). In addition to the Bhopal
and Indore plants (20,000 1/day each), the following GOMP-owned plants are
also in the project area: Ratlam, Ujjain, Hoshangabad, each of 2,000 1/day
capacity. Milk reaches processing plants, in 40 1 cans, by contract trucker
while at the village level, agent/collectors procure and transport it to
collection points by bicycle or oxcart.
3.07      Most agent/collectors pay the village producer between Rs 1.20 and
1.80 per 1; though usually offering an inferior product, they operate from
villages comparatively close to the urban centers and are serious competitors
to organized milk schemes which have to bear the higher cost of processing.
Under the present marketing system, the city producer selling direct to a
regular consumer clientele is also very competitive with the agent/collector
even though the former must buy all his feed supply. To reduce feed costs
many city producers purchase cows in milk and selling them at the end of
their lactationt they do not therefore generally rear calves.
Dairy Cooperatives
3.08      The Dairy Cooperative movement in the project area came into exist-
ence around 1960 with the creation of the government milk schemes to assure
supply for their processing pla nts. Due to the subsidized milk price policy
of the GOMP dairies and other organizational shortcomings, the cooperative
movement has lost ground, with many societies existing only in name, less
than 100 societies supply milk at present to the GOMP plants.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      In an area of suitable potential:  western Madhya Pradesh, the project
would provide, over six years, the necessary inputs to develop an enclave
of high milk production. It would not only benefit the area itself but
also generate a significant surplus of milk that would be channeled to other
large deficit markets outside the state. It would organize village cattle
owners to form Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) which would be grouped into
unions similar to the AMUL scheme in Gujarat. The unions would employ
technicians and managers, and be controlled by farmers. Each union would
own and manage its own dairy and feed plant and would provide milk collection,
marketing, veterinary, AI and extension services to the member DCS. About
160,000 families, most of whom farm less than 2 ha or are landless, would be
involved. The Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation (MPDDC) would be
set up to coordinate and implement the project through the unions.



- 8 *
4.02      The project comprises:
(a) Establishment of about 1,200 DCS, three milk producers unions
and the MPDDC,
(b) Importation and multiplicat:ion of purebred exotic breeding
stock and an associated AI program of crossbreeding native
village cattle with high producing exotic breeds. Provision
of extension programs to encourage production of fodder,
mixed farming and improved animal husbandry,
(c)  Construction of three union dairy plants and cattle feed mills;
and the establishment of milk collection routes and milk
chilling centers,
(d)  Provision of consultant services to assist MPDDC,
(e)  Provision of a training center for each union (UTC), an
extensive training program for developing instructors
for training technical and field staff, and fellowships
for key personnel.
The project does not include a farm credit component, as crossbreds are not
available for purchase. Credit for clug wells for increasing fodder produc-
tion would be available through ARC schemes for minor irrigation under the
Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project (391-IN) (2.15).
B. Detailed Features
New Institutions
4.03      The Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation (MPDDC) to be
established under the project, would be the center for coordination and
implementation of project activities. It would be the base from which consul-
tants and other expertise would schedule and direct the organization of the
unions and through them the implementation of the DCS. To ensure that the
essential AMUL features are adopted when establishing the DCS and the unions,
MPDDC would engage the services of NDDB on a contract basis. NDDB would assist
in training the nucleus staff of MPDDC, unions and spearhead teams. NDDB
would supervise the implementation of the DCS during the first year. NDDB
would also assist in effecting a marketing study (4.12) and furnish consult-
ing services to the MPDDC in the preparation of engineering specifications
for the procurement of equipment and construction of the dairy plants and
feed mills as well as for evaluation of tenders (6.10). It is a condition
of credit effectiveness that (i) MPDDC had been established under articles
of association acceptable to IDA, anc! (ii) that MPDDC had engaged NDDB
to assist in and training of consultants and MPDDC and union management
staff, and to provide other consulting services.  Assurances were also given



- 9 -
that about year five, the future role of MPDDC either as a corporation, a
federation of the unions, or other, would be reviewed with IDA.
4.04      Three unions 1/ would be established each incorporating about 400
DCS implemented over a five year period, making a total about 1,200 DCS.
By-laws would be similar to AMUL's (Annex 3). The principal fundtions and
responsibilities of a union would be to: (a) organize and effect the imple-
mentation of the DCS; (b) assist the DCS with organization, management, in-
spection and auditing; (c) establish and supervise milk and cattle feed trans-
portation; (d) process and market the members' milk and operate the feed
mills; (e) provide animal health and breeding services; (f) demonstrate
improved mixed farming and fodder production techniques.
4.05      The principal functions and responsibilities of a DCS would be
to: (a) act as a center for milk collection (b) effect regular payments to
producers; (c) sell balanced feed; (d) provide AI services; (e) communicate
cooperative and technical information to members. Assurances were given by
GOMP that the three unions and the 1,200 DCS would be formed under by-laws
acceptable to IDA and no existing society or union would be incorporated with
the project.
Crossbreeding and Milk Production
4.06      Milk production would begin from native cattle and buffalo and would
be gradually increased, primarily by upgrading low producing native cows through
an AI program of crossbreeding with high producing exotic breeds (mainly Jersey,
although other exotic breeds would also be considered) and by better nutrition.
4.07      MPDDC would own and operate an exotic bull breeding farm near Bhopal,
to be financed under the project. The breeding farm would supply bulls (exotic
and buffalo) to the three union bull farms (AI centers). Initially a founda-
tion herd of about 75 in-calf heifers would be imported for the breeding
farm and 25 bulls to be supplied to the bull farms of the unions. The bull
farms would supply fresh semen that would be delivered daily to the DCS by
the milk collection trucks, following the pattern of the AMUL model.
4.08      The low quality crop residues, which traditionally comprise the
main roughage component of the native animal's diet are inadequate to maintain
crossbreds and would be supplemented with high quality green fodder and balanced
concentrate feed in pellet form. Advised by the proposed extension services,
farmers with irrigated land would be encouraged to grow fodder for their own
use and also for sale to other members.  Under present conditions production
of alfalfa renders a net income to the farmer comparable to that from wheat.
4.09      The incremental fodder demand of the crossbreedes by year ten, would
require a total 15,000 ha of irrigated land (Annex 1). There are about 80,000
1/  MPDDC would organize the unions which would implement the DCS; MPDDC
would bear the initial cost as the unions could only be legally consti-
tuted after at least 25 DCS had been registered.



- 10 -
wells in the nine districts of the project and about 25%, equivalent to an
irrigated area of 10,000 ha would belong to farmers expected to join the DCS.
This area would not be sufficient for fodder production, therefore, about
25,000 additional wells would be dug (over a 10 year period) allowing for
members with irrigated land who would continue growing other crops. Ground
water is available and assurances were given at negotiations that loans
would be available to eligible DCS members for minor irrigation for fodder
production from the Madhya Pradesh agricultural credit project (391-IN) and
other ARC schemes. Each union would also operate a feed mill of about 75
tons per day capacity for producing the premixed balanced concentrate feed.
Construction of these mills would be matched to the growth of demand for
feed as projected to year eight when their capacity would be saturated.
4.10      By year ten of a DCS, all native cows would have been replaced by
crossbreds. However mainly due to improved calving rates, the average DCS
member cattle herd would have increased from about 170 Animal Units (AU) in
year three to 220 (30% increase) in year ten. The membership of a typical
DCS would be about 30% (56) of the total village households in the first year,
50% (93) in the second year, stabiLizing at 70% (130) in the third year.
Based on the experience at AMUL, the DCS would be implemented with the fol-
lowing phasing, similar for all three unions: year one: 70 DCS, year two:
80; year three: 90; year four: 80 and year five: 80. Thus total project
milk collection 1/ would only be 72 million 1 in year one, increasing to 127
million 1 in year five and 452 mil:Lion in year ten (Annex 4 Table 4). The
incremental milk production 2/ wou:Ld be 71 million 1 (160% increase in a DCS)
in year five and 384 million 1 (400% increase in a DCS) in year ten.
Milk Collection, Processing and Marketing
4.11      Milk would be collected i-rom the DCS along defined and economi-
cally viable routes involving about: 13 - 15 DCS in each route. Milk from
the DCS would be picked up daily and transported to the dairy plants by a
fleet of both owned and hired trucks operated by the union; nine chilling
centers would be provided for pooling milk from distant routes serviced by
three 13,000 1 capacity road tankers for freighting the milk to the plants.
4.12      The project provides for the construction of three milk processing
plants each with an initial capacity of 100,000 1/day, which would be expanded
in two stages (Year 4 and 5) to 200,000 1/day to match the increase in milk
supplies under the project (Annex 4 Table 4). The existing plant at Bhopal
and Indore are too small and outdated and assurances were given by GOMP
that they would be phased out or relocated after the new plants come on
stream in year 3. General layouts and building design would allow this
expansion in a functional manner. Due to surplus production, on an average,
1/   Excludes milk retained by farmer for family and calf feeding.
2/   Includes milk retained by farmer for family and calf feeding and assumes
that the present traditional production would remain static.



- 11 -
plants would be equipped to retail only about one quarter of their volume
in the urban market, and three quarters for conversion into milk powder
(Annex 4 Table 10). Bhopal and Indore plants would be equipped to meet
a comparatively larger urban demand, than the Ratlam plant located in
smaller urban center. The NDDB would assist in conducting marketing studies
prior to plant construction to determine the appropriate product mix for
each plant. With these provisions the unions would not have to cut back
milk collections during the life of the project, even in the flush season,
for lack of processing capacity. Milk would be retailed both in bulk and
bottles (1/2 1), from union owned booths and private foodstores in the major
urban centers.
Technical Assistance, Training and Extension
4.13      The project provides for the following consultants, some expected
to be available in India, to assist MPDDC in implementing the project:
(a) A dairy plant engineer to check plans, layouts, specifications,
evaluate tenders and supervise construction.
(b) A dairy processing expert to train union plant personnel
in operating the new plants, process monitoring and qual-
ity control.
(c) A mass-media communications expert to assist spear head teams
in developing visual and other aids to transmit effectively
the concept of the AMUL model to the farmers and motivate
them to join the DCS.
(d) A dairy marketing expert to advise on optimization of production
schedules and marketino stratoqv within thp  _nntpxt of three
dairy plants.
(e) A forage/livestock production expert to select about 30 farms
owned by progressive farmers and set them up for demonstration
purposes, in applied animal husbandry and milking hygiene and
incorporating permanent pasture/fodder crops grown exclusive-
ly for milk production.
4.14      Assurances were given by GOI and GOMP that consultants acceptable
to IDA, would be recruited for MPDDC. For consultants' terms of reference
see Annex 6.
4.15      Establishment and operation of three Union Training Centers (UTC)
with training equipment and staff would be financed under the Project. Each
center would provide about 1,000 man months of training annually during
formation of the DCS. Trainees would range from dairy farmers to DCS and
Union staff and Board members. Course content would relate to the AMUL
model, in the case of DCS trainees would involve Al, milk testing and basic
record keeping, and cooperative principles. The project also provides for
intensive extension effort during the development phase involving some 50
village extension workers (VEW) per union. The VEW would assist producers in
the application of basic principles of animal husbandry, milking hygiene,



- 12 -
feeding, fodder production and mixed farm management as directed by the
fodder/livestock consultant and practiced on the demonstration farms. The
VEW and UTC instructors, along wLth key union staff, and spearhead teams
would be trained by NDDB and the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI).
Overseas fellowships for three key staff of each union would also be provided.
Assurances were given that project funds for training and extension would
be channeled to the unions, quari:erly, through MPDDC. Training and Extension
programs are in Annex 6; timing .nd duration of training and extension
activities are in Annex 6 Chart I.
4.16      The animal health serv:Lces to be furnished to the DCS by the unions
include a mobile veterinary unit for every 35 societies involving a vehicle
equipped with animal health and vaccination kits and staffed by a veterinarian
and trained assistant which would visit the DCS weekly without charge. Emer-
gency service would be available on call, at all times, to members and to
nonmembers for a fee.

account for unforeseen building and equipment corresponding to final plant
product mix. A 5% physical contingency has been applied to investments in
MPDDC. No physical contingencies are needed for establishment costs, training

5.02      The proposed IDA credit of US$16.4 M would be to GOI and would
finance about 53% of the project costs. IDA financing would cover all
foreign exchange expenditures (US$7.5 M) and about 37% of local costs.
IDA funds for the purchase of imported cattle, DCS equipment and for training
and extension services would be channelled to MPDDC through GOI (US$2.75 M).
All other IDA funds (US$13.65 M) would be channelled through ARC and parti-
cipating banks, to MPDDC and the unions under subsidiary loan agreements

satisfactory to IDA. Project lending terms and conditions are detailed in
Annex 2, Appendix 1. Details of the financing plan are shown in Annex 7,
Table 2.
5.03      GOI-GOMP contributions (US$10.9 M) would finance about 35% of pro-
ject costs. They would cover the equity financing for investments (US$4.25 M)
of the institutions set up under the project and provide the necessary start-
up costs (US$2.1 M) to cover the expected deficits over the first four years
of operations. In addition, GOI-GOMP would provide funds to support training
and extension (US$0.6 M) and subsidize the sale of calf rations for rearing
of the first crossbred calves (US3.75 M) and provide for local cost financing
of technical services and imported cattle (US$0.2 M). ARC and participating
banks would contribute US$3.75 M, about 12% of project costs, for financing
investments and working capital of MPDDC and the unions. Farmers' contribution
to the project is estimated at US$0.15 M, their minimum capital subscription
to become DDS members. Assurances regarding GOI, GOMP, ARC and participating
banks financing commitments were given at negotiations. During negotiations,
GOMP demonstrated that it had made substantial progress on training of
project personnels under a program recommended by IDA. Completion of this
program prior to project commencement would be essential and IDA financing
for such expenditures after June 1974, subject to a maximum of $50,000 would
be provided.
C. Procurement
5.04      MPDDC would be the sole procurement agent for all items financed
by IDA. All major equipment (Annex 4) for the three milk-processing plants
and feedmills (US$12.3 M) would be bulked in accordance with phased con-
struction and expansions (Annex 4 Table 4) and subject to international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with IDA Guidelines. As most leading manu-
facturers of the equipment are well represented in India and are competitive,
tenders would be advertised locally, and the representatives of potential
supplier countries informed. Locally manufactured equipment would be
allowed a 15% preference or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower.
Appropriate assurances were given. Consultants services (US$ 0.7 M) would
also be procured according to IDA guidelines. Minor equipment, items for
the plants such as electrical components, equipment fittings, and furniture
(US$5.0 M) would not be amenable to bulking and would be purchased over six
years as phasing requires. Since ready availability of service and spare
parts is essential, these would be purchased locally as needed from reputable
suppliers.
5.05      As civil works for the construction of milk processing plants,
feedmills, MPDDC and the unions, (US$4.8 M) would be dispersed in time and
place, they would each be too small to attract international bidding and
would be subject to local contracting by competitive tender.
5.06      Equipment for the DCS (US$0.5 M), and for MPDDC and unions such
as farm machinery, irrigation equipment, breeding equipment, trucks, and
vehicles (about US$1.4 M) would be purchased following local competitive



- 16 -
bidding, since these items would be purchased in small quantities over the
project period. For procurement of imported bulls and dairy heifers for
the MPDDC breeding farm and the unions' bull farms (US$0.2 M), assurances
would be sought from GOI that tenders would be called from at least three
countries free from foot and mouth disease where animals of the required
breed, type, and adaptability are available. The remaining project costs
(US$6.3 M) would be for union and DCS establishment costs (initial operating
deficits) training and extension services, working capital and calf rearing
grant.
D. Disbursements
5.07      IDA disbursements are expected to extend over seven years (Annex
7 Table 5) and would be against appropriate documentation:
(a) 100% of cif expenditures, or of ex-factory costs, if locally
manufactured of milk an,l feed-processing equipment to be pro-
cured under ICB;
(b) 100% of cif expenditures for imported cattle and 100% of
the cost of consultant services and fellowships;
(c) 70% of expenditures for locally procured equipment and
civil works; including ongineering;
(d)  80% of project expendituLres on local training, union
training centers and extension program.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.08      Assurances were given that ARC would maintain project accounts,
audited by independent and qualif:Led auditors, the audited accounts to be
submitted to IDA within four months after the close of each fiscal year.
Commercial firms audit the accounts of the commercial banks. Accounts of
cooperative institutions LDB, MPSGB, DCS and Unions ) are audited by the
Department of Audit and Inspection under the Registrar of Cooperatives in a
manner satisfactory to IDA. Howevrer, AMUL experience has shown that a single
annual audit of DCS is insufficient. Efficient management of AMUL village
dairy cooperatives called for intensive and continuous audit service involv-
ing about 50 field inspectors from the State of Gujarat Cooperative Department.
This service has been highly satisfactory and has proven to be a major factor
contributing to AMUL's success. issurances were given that the GOMP Depart-
ment of Audit would: (a) audit the accounts of the unions, submitting the
audited accounts to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year;
(b) provide audit to each DCS, with at least one full audit and two book
supervisions per year; (c) strengthen its staff to carry out the above
functions; and also that MPDDC would maintain audited project accounts, sub-
mitting accounts to IDA within six: months after the end of each fiscal year.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation
6.01      GOI and GOMP would subscribe equally to all of MPDDC's initial paid
up capital. As a condition of effectiveness, (i) GOI and GOMP would invest
initial equity capital of Rs 0.275 M each (Annex 5 Table 3) and (ii) GOMP-
would provide redeemable share capital to cover the first year's estimated
startup costs (Rs 0.5 M). GOI and GOMP would also provide additional equity
financing to ensure that MPDDC qualifies to borrow funds from participating
banks for project investments, according to criteria listed in Annex 2
Appendix 1. Assurances regarding GOI and GOMP equity financing were given.
An assurance was also given that, not later than year six (1980) of the
Project, both GOI and COMP would offer for sale their shares in MPDDC to
the unions, at par value, until the unions had attained at least 75% owner-
ship.
6.02      MPDDC would be established by GOMP and governed by a fifteen member
board of directors (Annex 5). A Managing Director with qualifications and
experience acceptable to IDA, would carry out executive duties assisted by
about five Divisional Managers (Annex 5 Chart 1). MPDDC articles of associa-
tion would also require IDA approval before incorporation. Recruitment of
three of the five consultants and three divisional managers of MPDDC would be
a condition of effectiveness.
B. Unions and Cooperatives
6.03      Each cooperative milk producer's union would have an eleven member
board of directors (Annex 4). Initial farmer representation would be six,
elected from among and by the chairmen of the affiliated DCS. Once the DCS
become majority shareholders (year eight-nine) they would acquire the right to
appoint the Chairman of the board. A General Manager appointed by the board
and approved by MPDDC for the first year following establishment of the unions,
would be responsible for day-to-day management of the union and would also be
an exofficio board member.
6.04      GOI and GOMP would finance as equity at least 20% of union invest-
ments (Rs 34 M), so as to maintain a suitable debt to equity ratio to ensure
the unions' creditworthiness. GOMP would also provide additional redeemable
equity capital to cover the unions' initial operating deficits (Rs 14.6 M).
Assurances as to these financial commitments were given by GOMP and GOI. Under
cooperative law DCS are required to allocate 25% of their net income to a
reserve fund and DCS bylaws (Annex 3) would require that 80% of this reserve
fund be held as union shares. With these funds, DCS would buy out Government
equity in the unions, expecting to become majority shareholders by about
year eight (1982), of the project. Assurances were given that GOMP and GOI
would not later than in year six (1980) of the project and each year
thereafter, offer for sale their shares in the unions, at par value, to



- 18 -
individual DCS, until the DCS had attained at least 75% ownership. In addi-
tion, assurance were given that GOMP share capital subscriptions for initial
operating deficit, would be redeemed once the loans from banks are prepaid.
Government equity financing and its acquisition by the DCS is estimated
in Annex 4, Table 14. After debt service, paying dividends and bonuses to
DGJS, retained earnings (estimated at about Rs 26 M by year ten) would be
used for a further stage of dairy and feed plant expansion.
The Village Dairy Cooperative Societies
6.05      The village dairy cooperative society (DCS) would be the basic
organization unit. Each would be normally managed by a committee of nine
members, elected for a three-year term. The committee would elect a chairman
and a member who would represent the cooperative and would be eligible to
stand for election to the union board of directors. During the first year of
operation the DCS would be managed by a five member committee. The committee
would appoint a paid secretary who would be responsible for day-to-day
operations. There would also be one to four helpers to assist the secretary.
All would be trained in AI, emergency first aid and milk testing as well as
in bookkeeping, at the Union Training Center (Annex 6). They would be
paid from the revenues of the society derived from commission on milk sold
to unions and feed sol, to members (Annex 3, Table 5).
6.07      Each DCS would be capitalized by share subscriptions by members
and entrance fees. For each newly formed DCS, GOMP would grant the capital
equipment (Rs 2,000/DCS) and operating deficit in the first year (Rs 750/DCS).
Initial working capital needs would be financed by the shares subscriptions.
Total cost to GOMP is estimated at Rs 3.2 M for capital equipment and initial
operating deficit. Assurances were given that GOMP would meet this financial
commitment. Similar grants are available elsewhere in India where Government
promotes producer cooperatives, including AMUL, and are essential to bring
about a rapid transformation in the rural institutional framework that the
AMUL model implies.
C. Project Irplementation
6.08      The project has a defined scope and its implementation would be
planned with each step scheduled in a critical path fashion. The MPDDC would
be set up immediately, the three unions within one year, and the 1,200 DCS
would be established progressively over a period of five years.
6.09      The project authority and center of coordination would be the MPDDC.
This would be the seat of the hired consultants and other experienced execu-
tives (Divisional Managers) who would be coordinated by the Managing Director.
The Divisional Managers would each be responsible for carrying out a specific
phase of the project. This would be done by working through their respective
counterparts in the unions, who in turn would be responsible for the same
specific phase within their own unior.



- 19 -
6.10      Major initial steps in implementing the project would be to organize
the MPDDC, recruit, train and appoint the executive staff of the MPDDC, and the
three unions. In coordination with its respective MPDDC Divisional Manager,
each union Divisional Manager woulc letermine the workload of his Division,
the schedule, the staff required, including spearhead teams and arrange for
its recruitment and training. The participation of NDDB would be essential
in selecting and training staff and supervise spearhead teams and also in
assisting in the marketing study and in the preparation of specifications-
and evaluation of tenders for construction of the plants (Annex 4 Appendix 1).
D. Supporting Activities
Biological Vaccine Production
6.11      The requirements of vaccine against rinderpest, hemorragic septi-
caemia, blackquarter and anthrax as well as foot and mouth disease would be
assured on a state-wide basis with the expansion of the Institute at Mhow
(Indore) planned under the Fifth five-year Plan.
E. Lending Operations
6.12      ARC would invite all banks operating in the project area to parti-
cipate in the project. Based on eligibility criteria agreed to with IDA,
ARC would determine the eligible banks. To ensure effectiveness and unifor-
mity of supervision the minimum number of banks required to adequately
serve the four subloans would be selected in consultation with the unions and
MPDDC. Suitable assurances were given. ARC would provide at least 80%
refinance for the bank's loans. Subloan proposals, on behalf of the unions,
would be prepared by NPDDC in consultation with NDDB and submitted to the
participating banks. It is a condition of effectiveness that (a) a subsidiary
loan agreement between GOI and ARC, approved by IDA, had been executed,
(b) loan agreements satisfactory to IDA, between ARC and participating banks
had been concluded.
6.13      Project lending terms and criteria are detailed in Annex 2 Appendix 1.
Unions and MPDDC would pay at least 11% per annum, the participating banks,
and ARC, 7.5%. These rates are in line with the current rates in the agri-
culture sector in India. The participating banks would be required to ope-
rate a project supervision group, in consultation with ARC to continuously
monitor the progress of the project, submit quarterly reports and make
recommendations to the banks, ARC and IDA. The necessary assurances were
given. Funds for training and extension would not be refinanced through banks
as they would be a GOI-GOMP grant.

VII. PRODUCTION, MARKESTNG, PRICES, SUBSIDIES,
AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
Production
7.01      Initially production would be increased from existing native cattle
and buffalo by adoption of better mnanagement and feeding practices, but the
greatest increase would come from an intensive program of cross-breeding
native cattle with high producing exotic breeds. The first cross-bred cows
would come into production in year four increasing in significant numbers
thereafter (Annex 3). In year three of a DCS (full membership) milk collected
daily (cows and buffalo) would be about 100 1; in year five, 190 1; and in
year ten, 450 1. In year five the total daily increase in milk production
from present levels would be 190,000 1 and 1,050,000 1 in year ten.
Marketing
7.02      Despite growth of the cities in the project area, after year six,
project milk production would be far in excess of the urban demand (about
220,000 1/day). Allowing for the 1?rivate vendors who would supply about 20%
of the urban demand, the remaining 80%, supplied by the unions, would only
represent about one quarter of theLr production. The Union milk sold in the
cities, would be about 50% in bottLes (1/2 1) and the balance in bulk form
sold at union owned booths and from vending machines installed in grocery
shops. The booths would also serve as outlet for union milk (chilled, raw)
during the first two years when plants are under construction. The balance
of the milk production would be converted into butter, ghee and skimmed powder,
for which there is a ready market Ln big milk deficit centers like Delhi,
Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. Marketing and product mix assumptions are shown
in Annex 4, Table 10. The marketing study proposed under the project would
establish the optimal product mix Eor each plant, before construction.
Prices
7.03      Assurances were given by GOMP that each union would be free to
set the sale price of its products, the procurement price of milk and charges
for services to members, independently of state controls. In view of the cost
of union services and processing, the project would not be able to supply the
urban market with low priced milk 'ut would supply wholesome milk at prices
(bottled: Rs 1.70/1; bulk: 1.60) in competition with the private producers
and vendors.  The average prices ini the urban markets would be expected to
decline particularly during the lean season when they are over Rs 2 per liter.
Following the AMUL model, village producers would be paid according to butter
fat content of their raw milk or about Rs 26/kg butter fat, a price higher
than the average Rs 23/kg under the traditional intermediary system. (Annex
3, Table 7). Village producers wouild also increase their purchasing power
for feed supplies and would retain more of the fodder now sold to urban
producers.



- 21 -
Grants, Subsidies and Cost Recovery
7.04      The present policy of Government dairies implies a subsidization
of consumer milk prices that would come to an end in the project area when
the unions determine prices in their members' interest. The only non-
recoverable expenditures under the Project are GOI-GOMP startup grants to
the DCS (training, extension and calf rearing), justified to facilitate the
setup of new cooperative organizations and the spread of proven crossbreeding
technology to rural areas. Loan components under the project are all re-
coverable at commercial interest rates. Farm income and the sale of milk-
are not taxed, but the Government would earn sales tax on processed milk
products and income taxes on MPDDC and the unions.
7.05      To ensure the proper care of the early crossbred calves during
the critical first three months of their lives and to encourage the spread
of crossbreeding, GOI and GOMP would subsidize the provision of calf starter
rations for their first crossbred female calf to members of the DCS up to a
maximum of Rs 200 per member. Assurances were given that the GOMP Animal
Husbandry Department would administer the calf rearing subsidy program.
Financial Results
7.06      All institutions set up under the project would be financially
viable and would generate a satisfactory rate of return. DCS would earn
surpluses from year two onward. Financial rates of return at the unions'
overall activities would be about 20% (see Annex 4, Table 13). NPDDC would
charge a yearly levy from each union to cover the cost of services starting
year five.  The MPDDC bull farm would be an independent profit center.  Its
financial rate of return would be about 13%. The typical smallholder in the
project area now owns one nondescript native cow, yielding about 500 1 of
milk per lactation. Part of this milk is consumed by the calf and the
household, so that cash income from the sale of surplus milk would seldom
exceed Rs 100 per lactation. In adaddition to providing for increased domestic
consumption of milk, net cash income from a crossbred cow would be about   t
Rs 400 per year (Annex 3, Table 6). As the smallholders in the project area
are predominantly subsistence farmers, dairying would be their main source
of cash income and link to the money economy.
7.07      In addition, the project would afford small farmers the opportunity
to adopt a mixed farming system through the integration of a profitable live-
stock enterprise (commercial dairying) into their traditional (cropping) system.
Since such a change would involve the introduction of pasture/fodder crop
rotation, it would result in long-term improvement in soil structure and ferti-
lity which would largely compensate for some diversion of land to fodder.



22 -
VIII. ECONOMIC COSTS, BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
8.01      The direct economic benefit of the project would be the increased
production of milk. The incremen-al annual milk production is estimated
st 285?8O00 tons by year ten.  Alt'lough ampLe markets would exist, potential
increase in milk production after year ten has not been taken into account
because additional processing capacity required then is not included in the
project investments.
8.02      The proiect would directly benefit, through increased incomes, about
160,000 agricultural households, -nost of Qhom farmless than 2 ha, (15% land-
less), or approximately 0.9 million people, which is about 20% of the rural
population in the project area. rhe establishment of 1,200 DCS, three milk
unions with their own milk plant 3 and feed mills would provide direct employ-
ment for about 6,200 people. It would also support a milk transport service
of about 70 vehicles mostly owner operated.
8.03      Social benefits would ba derived after the village DCS become
firmly established with a regular surplus of funds (estimated at Rs 9,000
annually by year eight). These f-inds would most likely be used to augment
or initiate village development schemes such as education, health, family
planning, minor public works and infrastructure (AMUL model). A further
benefit would accrue from improvei nutrition due to increased intake of milk,
particularly by children and infants. The benefits to the consumers would
also come from an improvement in autrition due to increased availability of
unadulterated pasturized milk in the urban areas. Also, as the share of
hygienic pasturized milk to raw milk increases, the risk of milk borne
diseases such as TB, Brucellosis and gastrointestinal infections (parti-
cularly with infants) will decrease greatly.
8.04      The assumptions for computing the economic rate of return are in
Annex 8. Labor costs for feed and green fodder production are included
at their market price. Skilled and semi-skilled labor for milk plants and
feed mill operations is costed at market price. Incremental family labor
requirements for twice daily milking of crossbreds as opposed to native cows
are minimal (about 10 minutes/day) and would not affect alternative employ-
ment and are thus not considered significant. Milk is valued at Rs 1.50/1
which is a composite prilce of ex-plant fluid milk and the portion of the farm
production that would bypass the plants. This price is at the lower end of
the price range in urban markets. Based on these costs and benefits assump-
tions, the estimated economic rate of return is 34%.
8.05      The most significant risk facing the project is the task of creating
DCS and unions to establish a new cooperative controlled production and mar-
keting channel for the increased amount of rurally produced milk. NDDB's
experience in replicating the AMUL pattern in Gujarat and other parts of
the country indicates that human responses to such a program are varied but
that the obstacles, though many, are surmountable. Intensive training, exten-
sion and organizational support are essential in replicating the AMUL model



- 23 -
and the project places considerable emphasis on these critical inputs. A
sensitivity analysis to test the effect of higher costs and lower benefits
on the estimated rate of return was carried out. If investment and operating
costs are 10% higher while the benefits due to decreased production are 10%
lower, the economic rate of return is estimated to drop to 25%. A sensitivity
analysis to test the effect of slower formation of successful DCS, assuming
that plant investments are not delayed, shows that if successful DCS can only
be formed at half the rate envisaged, the expected rate of return would still
be 26% (Annex 8, Table 3).
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following major
points:
With GOI that:
(a) All major equipment of the milk processing and feed mill
facilities would be procured through international compe-
titive bidding, in accordance with IDA guidelines (5.04);
(b) Exotic dairy heifers, bulls and frozen semen would be pro-
cured on the basis of quotations requested from at least
three countries free from foot and mouth disease where
animals suitable to the project are available (5.06); and
With GOI and GOMP that:
(c) Consultants acceptable to IDA would be recruited for
MPDDC to assist the unions in the following activities:
dairy plant engineering, dairy marketing, dairy processing
engineering, mass-media communication expertise, and
forage/livestock production (4.14);
(d) They would invest an initial equity contribution in MPDDC of
at least Rs 0.275 M each and they would provide additional
equity financing as required over the project period to ensure
that MPDDC and Unions qualify for loans from participating
banks (6.01);
(e) They would, for the first time not later than 1980, and each
year thereafter, offer for sale their shares (i) in MPDDC
to the unions at par value until the unions had attained at
least a 75% ownership (6.01); and (ii), in the unions to the
individual DCS, at par value until the DCS had attained at
least 75% ownership (6.04);



- 24 -
With GOMP that:
(f) The DCS and the unions would be formed under bylaws acceptable
to IDA and that no existing cooperative societies and unions
would be eligible to part:Lcipate in the project (4.05);
(g) It would finance the start-up costs and initial operating
deficits of the DCS, unions, and MPDDC; such financing for

MAHDRYA PRADESH DAIRY T)EVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Dairy Sub-Sector
A. Background
General
1.        Annex 1 of Report No:  431-IN of Karnataka Dairy Development Project
contains a comprehensive review of the Dairy Sub-sector in India in general.
Agricul ture
2.        About 78% of the population is engaged in agriculture which in
1971/72 accounted for 52% of total state income. Approximately 21 million
ha (47%) is under cultivation and 14 million ha (37%) is covered by forest.
About 1.5 million ha (8%) is irrigated. Irrigated crops include rice, wheat,
barley, sugarcane, mustard, and fodder crops (alfalfa and berseem). Rice,
wheat, jowar, (sorghum) and gram are the most imnortant crops, wheat is largely
grown as a dry (rabi) crop and rice and gram during the kharif season. The
annual rate of agricultural growth durinm 1962/63 to 1970/71 was 2%. The
average holding is 3.9 ha.
3.        The production of foodgrains in Madhya Pradesh in 1971-72 was as
follows:

4.        Average production of foodgrain per canita is 270 kg/year comparing
favorably with 190 kg/year for all of India. This agricultural Droduction
comes mostlv from western 'Tadhya Pradesh t7here the Pro-ject would be located.
B. Dairv Livestock
Livestock and Breeds
5.        The present bovine population of Madhya Pradesh is about 26 million
cattle and 6 million buffalo. This represents 157 and 11% resnectivelv of
the Indian total. Some 8.1 million cattle and 29.5 million buffalo above 3
years of age are breedable milking stock. Onlv about 507 of these females
are in milk. Most animals do not conform to any snecific breed, the following
breeds can be identified:  cattle:  Malwi, Hariana, Gaolao, Nimari, Cir and
Kankathar. The prevalent buffalo breed is the Murrah for milk nroduction,
also the Bhadawi.
6.        There are seven government cattle breeding farms in the state Dro-
ducing pedigree bulls of the main hreeas, but only one maintains Jersey bulls.
Until 1970 the cattle breeding policy in the state was to upgrade the local
cattle with bulls of the dominant breeds in the state. However because of
the slow rate of genetic improvement through selection and the relatively low
potential for milk production of the indigenous milking breeds of cattle, it
is now proposed to introduce exotic breeds of dairy cattle to upgrade local
cattle to a level of 2/3 exotic blood.
7.        It is only in the last two years that exotic nurebred breeding of
dairy cattle have been introduced into the state for the nurpose of producing
bulls for crossbreeding with the inligenous cattle. This will be the breeding
method used in the project for improving milk Droduction. The Jersey breed,
because of its high fat content, low maintenance reouirements (small mature
body size), and availability of high qualitv stock, would be the preferred
cross. However other exotic breeds are being tested under controlled condi-
tions such as the Brown Swiss under the Indo-Swiss Breeding Project (Kerala)
and the Red Dane under the Danish Prolect Assistance Program (Karnataka).
Management of exotic stock and crossbreeding in India requires close super-
vision. Some important features are:
(a) it takes two to three years to acclimatize exotic animals:
(b) even after such acclimatization the exotic population does not
normally reach the production level which could be expected
in its home country-
(c) it takes time for local management to adapt to the requirements
of the exotic breeds and their cross breds:



ANNEX I
Page 3
(d)  crossbred heifers show a much earlier maturity than their native
mother but in mating, consideration must be given to their lower
body weight and measurements as comnared with the exotic animals;
(e)  under Indian conditions the proportion of exotic blood
would be about 2/3. The Indo-Swiss Project is aiming at a 50% dual
purpose (dairy and draught) crossbred where the indigenous parental
stock is a crossbred between Hariana (dairy and draught) and
Sahiwal (dairy) breeds;
(f)  an improved animal can express its higher production potential
only under adequate management and feeding.
Milk Production
8.        Indian native cattle and buffalo mature late, calving for the first
time around four years of age, with an intercalving period of two years (50%
calving) and have low milk production. Cows in milk average 1-1/2 1. per day
(500 1. per lactation) and buffalo around 2.5 1. per day (800 1. ner lactation).
First cross project heifers by Jersey bulls are expected to produce an average
2,300 1 per lactation.
9.        The following selected data show the milk yields of crossbreds
compared with their indigenous dams:

C. Feed Requirements
Feeds and Feedin
10.       The most common cattle feeds are:  byproducts of agricultural crops:
straw, sugarcane tips; cultivated fodders: alfalfa, berseem (clover) and
hybrid napier; perennial pasture grasses; concentrates from rainfed crops:
barley, cottonseed, gram (chickpea): oilcake from groundnut, sesame, rape,
cottonseed. The low quality crop residues which comprise the main roughage
component of the native animal's diet are inadequate to maintain crossbreds.
Therefore increased dairy herds and milk iroduction (Annex 3) under the
Project would depend on an adequate: sunnly of high auality forage and balanced



ANNEX I
Page 5
Dremixed feed. GOMP measures to encourage fodder production include demonstra-
tion farms for improved pastures and better management, seed multiplication
farms, distribution of hybrid napier seedlings, loans and grants for past~ure
improvement and for fencing of pasture land and subsidies for fodder seed and
chaff-cutters. However the largest scope for increased production of high
quality forage is by intergration of these fodder crops into existing irriga-
ted farms.
11.       The comparatively high agricultural production in Western Madhya
Pradesh where the Project area would be located, would virtually assure the
supply of the food grain ingredient (25%) and the agricultural byproducts
(75%) of the balanced concentrate feed. In view of the need of increased
supplies of milk for better human nutrition, together with the social impact
dairy development has for small farmers, the trade off between increased milk
production and a greater demand for cereal grains is readily accepted by
government, particularly as milk constitutes an important source of protein
for the large vegetarian segment of the population.
Incremental Feed Demand Under the Project:
12.       Indigenous cattle currently consume about 3 tons of straw, 3 tons
of green fodder, and 0.5 tons of concentrates during the year of lactation
(500 1 every second year). Crossbred cattle when seasonally well managed
require an additional 4 tons of green fodder and 1 ton of concentrate mix
in a year for producing about 2,300 1 per lactation. The replacement of
indigenous cows by crossbred stock in each DCS is also projected to increase
its member cow herd size from 170 AIT to about 220 AU at maturity. Allowing
for the phased implementation of the 1,200 DCS over five years, the total
numbers of crossbred cows, in year ten, would be about 120,000.
The total additional feed requirements, by year ten would then be:
Green fodder:
(a)  for crossbreds:  120,000 X 4             480,000 tons
(b) for increased milk production
of buffalo and indigenous cows:
70 million liters X 2 ton/1,000 1        140,000 tons
Total                               620,000 tons
at a yield of 50 tons/ha/year this would require about 15,000 ha of irrigated
land and approximately 25,000 dug wells.



A NN X I
Page 6
Prem.ixed feed:
(a)  for crossbreds:  120,000 X 1              120,000 tons
(b) for increased milk production
of buffalo and indigenous cows:
70 million liters X (l.5 ton/1,000 1       35,000 tons
Total                                155,000 tons
The additional requirements of premixed feed would involve about 40,000 tons
(25%) of cereal grain or about 0.3% of Madhya Pradesh's total present grain
production.
13.       There are at present about 80,000 wells in the nine districts of
the Project and about 25% (20,000) would belong to farmers expected to join
the DCS. As only about 10% have acoess to electric power for pumps, a dug
well of about 20 ft in diameter and 80 ft deep can only irrigate 0.6 ha
extracting the water with bullock power. The presently irrigated area to come
under the Project would thus be aboult 10,000 ha. This area would not be
sufficient for fodder production about 25,000 additional wells would have
to be dug (over a 10 year period) allowing for members with irrigated land
who would continue growing other crops. Ground-water is available, and also
on-farm credit to eligible farmers, through ARC, for minor irrigation schemes
for fodder production from the Madhya Pradesh Agriculture credit project
(391-1N) and other ARC schemes if and when required. Advised by the proposed
extension services under the Project, farmers with irrigated land would be
encouraged to grow fodder for their own use and also for sale to other members.
Under present conditions, production of berseem and alfalfa renders a net
income to the farmer comparable to wheat on irrigated land. In addition, and
most important, long term improvement in soil structure and fertility through
introduction of leguminous fodders into the crop rotation would increase
yields of other crops grown on the irrigated land.
D. Milk Production and M!arketing
Milk Producers
14.       Dairying in Madhya Pradesh is largely a subsidiary activity
to crop farming though in many instances it nrovides a daily cash income.
Over 80% of the cows and buffalo are kept in villages. The average size
herd is 2 - 3 breedable head per family. MIilk producers are of 3 categories:
(a) the landless who represent about 15% of the rural nopulation, keep
1 to 2 animals and purchase all feeds and fodders- (b) the mixed farmer
(croDping and livestock) whose maiTI income is from sale of drops surnlus to
household needs, dairying is a sideline which utilizes crop byproducts.  He
may use a small area of his land for growing fodder (alfalfa and berseem)
purchasing small amounts of concen":rate, herd size is about 2 to 5 animals
(c) the urban milk producer i-7th herds up to 20 head, he nurchases all the
feed and fodder and buy the cows al: peak production selling them when dry.



ANNEX I
Page 7
Urban milk producers keep about 12,000 crossbreds in the city of Bhopal. Total
milk production in the State is about 8,000,000 1./day equivalent to about
190 gr/capita, well above the national average of 110/115.
Dairy Cooperatives
15.       The Dairy Cooperative movement in the Project area came into existence
around 1960 with the creation of the G.ONP milk schemes to assure supply for
their processing plants.  Due to the controlled milk price policy of the GONP
dairies and other organizational shortcomings, the cooperatives movement has
lost ground, with many societies existing only in name, less than 100 societies
supply milk at present to the GOMP plants.
Milk Marketing
16.       The urban centers are the natural markets for village surplus milk
and in Madhva Pradesh as in most of India there are three main type of
suppliers of milk to the urban markets: (i) traditional village agents, (ii)
city producers; (iii) cooperative sector. The traditional village agent,
acting as a collector/middleman for private vendors in the cities is still
the main supplier. The suDply for city producers is also significant re-
presenting about 20% - 30% of the market. Villages that are remote from
main roads and urban centers, due to lack of adequate transportation, are
compelled to convert most of their milk into ghee (butteroil) wasting most
of the skimmed milk. Only about 40% of the milk is consumed in its fluid
condition.
17.       Most agent/collectors pay the village producer between Rs 1.20 - and
1.80/1, they operate from villages comparatively close to the urban centers,
though offering a poorer product, and are serious competitors to organized
milk schemes which have to bear the higher cost of processing.  Under the
present marketing system, the city producer selling direct to a regular con-
sumer clientele is also very competitive with the agent/collector even though
the former must buy all his feed supply. To reduce feed costs many city
producers purchase cows in milk and sell them at the end of their lactation,
they do not, therefore, generally rear calves. Madhya Pradesh has an un-
developed dairy processing and marketing structure resulting in severe short-
age with marked price escalation in the urban centers during the lean season.
The first milk processing plant was established by GOP in Bhopal in 1958.
18.       Milk prices of private vendors in Madhya Pradesh are not controlled
and the urban market price for raw milk varies according to type and season
from about Rs 1.50 to 2.50 per 1. The BOTM dairies market pasteurized milk in
1/2 1. bottles at significantly lower prices: Rs 1.70 per 1. of 3.2% fat
(EhoDal) and this makes them unable to pay village nroducers a competitive
price. This results in low procurement volume and operating losses due to
low throughput. Accordingly the GOMP milk schemes in Bhonal and Indore accomo-
dates only about 10% of the urban demand. In addition to the Bhopal and Indore



ANNEX I
Page 8
plants which have a capacity of 20,000 1./day each, the following government
owned plants are also located in the project area:  Ratlam, Ullain and Hoshan-
gabad, each of 2,000 l./day capacity. Mfilk reaches the processing plants,
in 40 1. cans, by contract truckers while at the village level agent/collectors
often procure and transport it to collection points by bicycle or oxcart. These
five niants represent a nrocessirg capacitv equivalent to 47 of the total tnresent
milk production in the Project area which is about 1,200,000 1./day.
E. Technical Services
Veterinary Services
19.       Disease prevention and control measures in the state are the respon-
sibility of the Department of Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry. For
the 45 districts the state has 52,5 Veterinarv Hospitals, 22 AI centers and
45 Mass Immunization and Mobile V'eterinary Units. The Mobile Veterinary Units
function is to control epidemics and carry out free of charge routine vacci-
nations for rinderpest and to a lesser extent for blackquarter and hemorragic
septicaemia. Approximately one fourth of the facilities operated by the
Department of Animal Husbandry for animal health services are located in the
Project area.
Vaccine Production
20.       The nresent GOMP vaccirLe production facilities at Mhow (Indore)
are insufficient (16 million dosEs/year) and will be expanded during the
Fifth Plan.  Vaccine production is of narticular importance to the exotic and
crossbred animals who are more susceptible to the infectious diseases that
are endemic in the country. The vaccines of importance to the Project are
hemorragic septicaemia, blackquarter, anthrax and rindetpest.  These are
offered without charge, governmernt bearing the cost. National production of
foot and mouth vaccine is currently being reorganized with the establishment
of regional production plants und[er the Danish Project Assistance Program.
At present Hioechst operates a small plant in Bombay of a capacity of 500,000
doses/year. The vaccine would be sold at Rs 3/dose which includes a 50% GOI
subsidy.
Artificial Insemination
21.       Artificial insemination is effected with fresh semen through six
central semen stations and 22 Al centres in the state. Due to shortage of
trained staff and poor communications and transport facilities less than 25%
of the semen is actually utilizedl. The following statistics on AI in the
district of BhoDal tend to confirm the present trend of crossbreeding:

2?.       Frozen semen from exotic stoclk is imnorted under bilateral aid
programs (Swiss, Danish, Canadian, and others) in limited auantities and used
mostly for the bull breeding farms.  Frozen semen gives low concention rates
(25%) with buffalo and this has precluded its use in the AK?TTI, model where
AI services are done with fresh semen delivered dailv on the milk collecting
trucks.  Conception rates at AMUL average 45%.
23.       The Danish Project Assistancp Program has provided five frozen semen
banks with a capacity of 125,000 doses/year for distribution through 50 Al units
each. One bank, scheduled for installation at Indore (subject to final GOI
decision), can receive, store and distribute frozen semen and would include a
liquid N2 Dlant.  An additional nine such units are undler consideration for
India under a US$40 Il grant bv the Danish government. The first five units
would operate on imported supplies of frozen semen. The subsequent nine
would include twenty exotic bulls each. The Danish Project Assistance Program
also includes a bull breeding farm at Bhopal with a foundation herd of 100
cows and four Jersey bulls, this is independent of the MPDDC bull breeding farm
required under the project.
F. Government Policies
24.       The policies followed, by the GOMP in the dairy subsector are essen-
tially those established by the GOI in its five-year nlans. Allocations for
the dairy subsector in the first three development plans were inadequate
causing Government to reconsider its nolicies in the Fourth and current Fifth
plan.  Together with the oblective of food grain self-sufficiency, livestock
development in India and in Ufadhya Pradesh is now gaining importance as a means
to diversify agricultural production.  Within the livestock sector, dairy
development has been given greatest emDhasis in MTO's Fifth nlan since, despite
milk and milk products providing the primarv source of animal protein
for the large vegetarian segment of the population the daily per capita
availability has fallen from 120 (1970) to 112 g (1973) GOI plans for dairy
develonment have been stimulated bv the successful AMUL experience and in
the Fifth fixre-year Plan GOI is encouraging the AMUL model as the basic means
to increase milk production. In addition, animal production, health and AI
facilities are proposed to be improved at State level and more emphasis placed
on increasing crossbred cattle. GOI would provide a crossbred calf subsidy
of Rs 200 per head, in the form of pre-mixed calf feed, to encourage farmers
to adoDt better feeding Dractices and so avoid losses of valuable crossbred
heifers due to malnutrition. The Fourth Dlan provides funds for the construc-
tion of a total five dairv plants and six rural dairies in Uadhya Pradesh of
which only one rural dairv would be in the Project area.

Project Lending Institutions
1.        IDA funds for loans to the MPDDC and the Unions would be on-lent
by GOI, through the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC). 1/ ARC is
well known to the Bank group, being the intermediary refinancing channel
for 15 ongoing IBRD/IDA credit projects.
A. Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
2.        ARC was established in 1963 as a subsidiary of RBI to provide a
supplemental source of medium- and long-term finance for agricultural
credit institutions and to guide them toward a development-oriented approach
in their operations. In support of the latter objective, ARC sponsors
orientation and training programs for management and technical staff of
financial institutions, helps strer.gthen the management and financial
operations of banks, especially the land development banks and, with the
expansion of its own technical division, is increasingly assisting financing
institutions in appraising the economic and technical feasibility of develop-
ment schemes as well as their supervision.
3.        During its first ten years of operations, ARC disbursed Rs 2,190 M
(US$274 M) against a total commitment of Rs 4,010 M (US$626 M). About 90%
of its refinance assistance has been for minor irrigation and land develop-
ment schemes. Other minor lending includes farm mechanization, plantation
and horticulture, poultry, fishery, dairy cattle, storage facilities and
market yards.  About 90% of ARC's refinance and assistance so far has been
disbursed through Cooperative Land Development Banks, 5% through State
Cooperative Banks and 5% through commercial banks.
4.        The spread between ARC's borrowing and lending rates is sufficient
to meet expenses and after declaring dividends to show a profit of Rs 0.37
crores (US$463,000) in 1973-73. ARC is in good financial condition, its
equity position is unimpaired by lcisses, and its assets in GOI securities
and debentures of land development banks are guaranteed in principal and
interest by GOI and State Governments.
1/   Full details of ARC's organization and financial operations are given
in Annex 4 of the Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Appraisal Report
No. 107a-IN, April 12, 1973.

5.        ARC would be required under the Project to:
(a)  establish participation criteria with IDA based
on conditions listed in Appendix 1: invite all
banks operating in the Project area to participate
in the Project: and make a list of eligible banks;
(b)  channel funds through not more than two banks
selected by the borrowing Unions & from the list
of eligible banks, providing 90% refinance
for project loans by these hanks and
(c)  chair and direct the operations of a Project
Supervision Group to be established by the
banks (Appendix 1).
B. Cooperative Banks
6.        There are two separate cooperative banking systems in Madhya Pradesh--
the Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDR) System which provides long-term
development credit--and the Cooperative Bank System which provides mostly for
crop produiction loans. Hlowever, these svstems are inderendent of each other
though both are supervised by the GOTP Registrar of Cooperatives.
MIadhya Pradesh State Cooperative Land Development Bank
7.        The LDB System is a federation of 44 Primary Land DeveloDment Banks
(PLDB) with most districts having at least one PL.DB. The LDB has its head-
quarters in Bhopal and six regional offices. Annual lending increased from
Rs 55 million in 1969-70 to 119 million in 1972-73. The emphasis is on
develooment, mainly irrigation wells, pumosets, tractors and implements and
land prenaration.  During 1971-72, LDB lending was as follows:
Purnose                                   Total Amount
(Rs millions)
New dug wells construction                     48.7
Pumpsets                                       14.2
Tractors & Machinery                           10.8
Well Repairs                                    0.4
Land Development                                1.0
75.1
8.        Principal LDB sources of funds are naid un share capital, reserves
and debentures. PLDB's are required to hold 5% of their borrowings from LDB
as share capital. As of 1973, paid up share capital was Rs 24.7 million, of
which 55% belonged to G0OP and 45% to the PLDB's. Reserves were Rs 386 million.
Net earnings improved from Rs 2.0 million in 1970-71 to Rs 3.5 million in
1971-72.

Mahya Prd                  erative Bank
10.       ""tie 4adhvea rrdesh Sts.te Cooperative Bank (NPCB) has a membership
of about A4<Ju s.cmpriseel of prinrry societies, central cooperative banks and
individunXs. At the base, there: are 10,000 primary cooperative societies
federated tmto 43 Central Cooperative Banks (CCR), one for each district.  GOI
and GOM   rovit2je substantial fitlancial assistance as equity capital, by sub-

contribit.on -o a stahblization fund for convertinz short-term uncollectibles

11.       The MPSCB loan oortfo.io is about 8Q0  short-term loans and cash credits
(a form if revolving credit), 20% medium-term. Borrowings are almost ex-
clusive7'v .Prc. the BT,. which annually provides 40-50% of the funds of the
cooperattlp han'king sys!em.
12.       ?-ofits have been stable at about Rs 4.2 m since 1970.  Lending
volume was Rs 715 million in 1972-73.  The ratio of overdues to amounts out-
standing for the CCBs is unsati:,factory. Thus, at the end of 1973 overdues
with the CCBs stood at 42% of d&mand with two reporting as high as 93% but
two below 2.t%.  CCB's overdue problems however, do not show on the MPCB
because c' the 3ignificant non-2CB membership of the MBCB.  The MPCB's over-
dues, at P.s 23.5 M against a loan portfolio of Ps 572 M in 1972 were about
5.0% of demand.
13.       FPSC2  given its good financing position would be invited to participate
ir. the P7rojct. although it has no experience in long-term lending.
C. Commercial Banks
14.       DArect financtng of agriculture by commercial banks is a recent
develoD,me"t, '1e-ginning primarily after the nationalization of major banks in
1969.             '4o-rowt b;as attempted to set targets for the opening of new branches
in rural areas, of which there are 60 now compared to 16 in 1969.  Performance
to date has been rodest with the commercial banks slowly building up expertise
for agricultural lending. Loars to date have been for tractors and pumpsets,
with crop l-3an and short-term credit limited to individuals who have taken

Page 4
medium-term credit. Commercial bank lendina in agriculture amounts to about
7% of the total bank credit outstanding. Collection record in agricultural
operations is generally similar to that of the LDB.
15.       In general, commercial banks are financially sound and are strengthen-
ing their agricultural staff capabilities to expand their role in agriculture.
However, they lack experience in long--term financing of processing plants, and
are reluctant to enter into the field of cooperatives. Civen the change em-
phasis following nationalization, it is. however, expected that commercial
banks would be keen to participate in the Project for long-term lending to the
cooperative sector for milk processing and cattle feed nlants. Conditions for
participation are given in Appendix 1. Considering the problems of overdues
and management of the LDB and MPCB, the narticipation of commercial banks
would be critical to the implementation of the Project. Assurances would be
sought that GOI, ARC, and GOMP would facilitate the participation of commer-
cial banks in the Project and that GOI, ARC and GOMP would provide guarantees,
if necessary, for their project loans to the Unions and MPDDC.

MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Dairy Cooperative Societies
The AMUL Stoy
1.        DCS and Unions under the project would be organized along the well
known and highly successful AMUL 1/ cooperatives operating in Gujarat. The
core of AMUL's success was the organizing of thousands of small farmers, each
cultivating an average of three acres, into hundreds of village cooperative
milk producer societies which, in turn, were federated into a union known as
the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Ltd., Anand. The term
"PiUL", an abbreviation for Anand Milk Union Ltd., in the Sanskrit language
means "priceless" and is used as the trade name for all milk products sold
by the Union.
2.        The Union was started in 1946 with two village milk producers'
societies. From a handful of producers in two village societies, producing
about 250 1 of milk daily, the AMUTL syster. today is based on some 785
village cooperatives with total membership of 225,000 individual milk pro-
ducers, all affiliated with the Union, which is now collecting about 150
million liters annuallv.
3.        Several unique features contributing to the success of the AMUL
pattern stand out. Its development: was based on self-help: its leadership
bre.w while overcoming strong resist:ance from vested private interests. AMUL
is unique in its ability to provide numerous economic and social benefits to
thousands of small farmers. Some of the more signifcant features include:
(a) technical services on animal husbandry and fodder programs; (b) avail-
ability of prompt veterinary health and Al services, (c) concentrate feed;
(d) seed and fodder seedlings:  (e) training programs for men and women; (f)
continuous supervision of the village cooperatives and auarterly audit:
navnent for milk based on butter fat content; (g) suDply of startup equipment
for each new society.
The DCS Model
4.        The DCS model (Table 1) is built upon data for the "average village"
in the project area which includes 10,300 villages (137 of Madhya Pradesh's
1/ Also see IBRD report on the Suervey of Successful ExDeriences in assisting
the Smallholder Livestock Producer dated December 1973 by Dr. E. McCauley
(Consultant), and the Karnataka Dairy Development Project Report (431a-IN).

total) having a population of about 4.4 million (about 13% of the State's rural
population). The Project is aimed at 3,700 villa-es, or approximately 60%
of those accessible. The area contains 0.5 million (about 20%) of the State's
breedable buffaloes and 1.0 million (about 13%) of its breedable cows. The
average village in the project area has a ponulation of 430, constituting
about 80 households. Of these households, about 80% own breedable animals
and approximately 15% are agricultural laborers who own no land or insufficient
land to meet their subsistence requirements.
6.        The average DCS is projected to reach its maximum membership in
the third year, covering about 70% of the village households and about 70%
of the village breedable cattle. In order to obtain the volume necessary
for viable operations, three average villages would be included in each DCS.
The project would consist of 1,200 DCS and at maturity, it would cover an
estimated 156,000 rural households, 124,000 breedable buffaloes and 247,000
breedable cows (see Table 1).
Milk Collection & Services
7.        DCS would collect milk twice daily.  The collection point wqould be
a building in the society's home village rented by the DCS. Collections would
be handled on a first-come--first-served basis and samples for fat testing
would be taken from every batch of milk. The quantity delivered by each
member would be noted at the time of delivery bv the DOS secretary trained
in milk testing (Annex 6), in a pocket record book carried by each member.
The payment according to fat content would be determined and recorded, along
with the volume delivered, in society records. irilk would be brought to the
main collection center from sub-centers in outlying villaaes. At each col-
lection sub-center a DCS helper would take a samnle of each member's delivery
and note the volume. These deliveries would be bulked and transported by
the DCS helper to the main collection center, where the samnles would be
tested and entries made in the WCS records. DCS staff would be trained (Annex
6) to provide Al and animal first aid services. Village extension workers
would provide technical assistance in crossbreeding and fodder production
through twice monthly contact with DCS members.
p~yment
8.        Payment would be based on quantity and fat content.  Payouts would
be made at regular, frequent intervals as specified by a majority vote of
the membership. DCS bylaws would not allow payments to be made less fre-
quently than once a week. Daily payments would be recommended. Prices
would have to be established in comnetition with the village traditional
agent/collector and improved on to attract Producers to the DCS. Bylaws
(Appendix 1) would permit price differential between members and non-members
for milk as well as feed. This would be in addition to the bonus of
Rs. 0.05/liter the DCS members would receive starting year 5.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Transportation
9.        DCS milk would be bulked ia 40 liter cans and transported from the
DCS collection center initially by uaion owned trucks, later expanding with
private contractors, engaged by the 'Unions. Each contractor would be required
to provide tangible security which could be realized by the Union in the event
of breach of contract, which would follow the ANIML format. The maximum time
between the first pickup on a route <nd the time of delivery of milk to the
dairy plant or chilling center would not exceed 4.5 hours.  Any spoilage of
milk would be for the contractor's account.  At the dairy plant or chilling
center each DCS batch delivered woulc! be sampled and tested for fat content
and SNF (solids-non-fat) and the DCS would be naid according to volume, SNF
and fat content. Union payments for milk to DCS would be made every other
day for the first five years. Paymerts made in cash would be delivered by
the transport contractor, or else by depositinR in the DCS account at the
nearest bank.
Investments and Financial  perat_ions
10.       The Dhysical investment for a DCS would consist of milk collection
and testing equipment, an AI crate. veterinary first aid equipment and some
furniture. Table 4 shows the projectad investment requirements of a typical
DCS and the total for the 1200 DCS to be formed under the Project. Table 2
shows the projections for milk collecl:ion and financial oDerations of a
typical DCS. Suppliers who are not DCS members would be charged extra com-
mission. The initial year's loss wou!d be covered by Government financing
the salary of staff for four months including two months in training. Equip-
ment would be provided. Working capital needs would be minimal as the Unions
would pav the DCS everv other day for its milk (DCS would pay the members
daily). These requirements would initially be financed from membership fee
and share capital and further increases, as the volume expands, would be
financed from surpluses. Application of annual surplus would be governed
by the bylaws, with the first 25% applied to a reserve fund, 80% of which
would be held in Union shares. The typical DCS would be able to declare a
small patronage bonus of about 1 p/lit in year 2 increasing to 5 p/lit by
year 5. At the same time a DCS would be able to purchase, in addition to
one share required to become a Union member, additional shares worth Rs. 700
in year 2, rising to Rs. 3,100 by year 5, out of the funds allocated to
Reserves. By year 10, a DCS is expectad to have a Reserve Fund of Rs. 73,000
of which Rs. 28,000 would be in the fonm of Union shares, Rs. 9,000 as working
capital and the balance available for other allocations, including village
develoDment, according to membershin decisions.
Accounts and _Aud iting
11.       DCS accounts would be maintained by the society secretary, who
would also supervise milk collection, record members' deliveries and compute
payments and disburse payments due eacb member. DCS secretaries would he



ANNEX 3
Page 4
trained in basic record keeping and other functions at the UTC (Annex 6).
Field managerial assistance would also be available to new DCS from the ITnion's
division of institutional development.  The accounts of each DCS wzould be
audited at least every four months bv the audit staff of the Registrar of
Cooperatives or the Union's surervisor. Results of each audit would be
communicated to the approoriate Union. The financial position of the DCS
would be communicated to members, along with the auditor's renort, at the
annual meeting. Any significant irregularities would be reported by the
Registrar of Cooperatives to a special membership meeting.   DCS would not
be charged for audits for the first three years but thereafter, would be
charged according to a schedule of fees to be specified by the Registrar of
Cooperatives.

MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Dairy Cooperative Union
A. Functions
1.        Under the Project, the DCS in each district (milkshed) would be
federated into a Union, established according to the State Cooperative law.
Once 25 DCS had been formed and onerating in a district, a Union would be
formally registered. At full development there would he about 400 DCS in
each Union. The Union, like DCS, would he a farmer service organization
providing the following services: Al, animal health, cattle feed produc-
tion, milk collection, Drocessino' and marketing, institutional development
and technical extension services in fodder Droduction and mixed farm
management.
Artificial Insemination Service--Bull Farm
2.        The Union would make a daily delivery of fresh semen to each DCS.
Each Union would invest in and onerate a bull farm to produce fresh semen
from Jersey and Buffalo males, for Al service in the village. Trucks leaving
for milk pickup would collect iced semen packs for delivery to the DCS. The
DCS secretary and helpers would be trained at the Union Training Center to
provide Al services (Annex 6).
Animal Health Service
3.        For each route covering about 35 DCS's the Union would operate a
mobile unit with vaccination and animal health kits and staffed by a
qualified veterinarian and helper to provide routine veterinary services to
the DCS. Each society would be visited once weekly on fixed days and at
a fixed time.  There would be no charge for such routine visits.  However,
emergency 24-hour service which would also be available, would cost a member
Rs 15 per visit, and a non-member Rs 20. A total of 50 mobile units (20
Union owned and others hired) by year five would be equipped to provide
routine health services, pregnancy diagnosis, and vaccinations. A union
would not operate a veterinary hospital as this service is available from
the GOMP hospitals in the Project area.
Milk Collection and Processing
4.        Milk would be collected from the DCS along defined and economically
viable routes involving about 13-15 DCS each. Milk in 40 1 cans from the



ANNEX 4
Page 2
DCS would be picked up daily anC transported to the dairy plants by a fleet
of both owned and hired trucks cnerated by the Union  nine chilling centers
would be provided for pooling milk from distant rouites services by three
13,000 1 capacity road tankers for frei2hting the milk to the plants. Pro-
cnssiig plants are discussed in Ap,Dndix 1.
Institutional Development and Technical Extension Services
5.        A Union Training Center (UTC) would be operated to cater to the
training needs of the DCS staff, members of the DCS 'fanagement Committee DCS
farmer membership as well as to Union staff. UTC investment estimates and
a description of the various training programs to he organized are given in
Annex 6. A total of 1,100 man months of training is expected to be provided
by the UTC annually. Management and organizational support to the DCS would
be provided by the Union, through frequent sunervisory visits, by supervisory
staff from the Institutional Development Division.  Extension needs of the
DCS would be considerable, esnecially during the early years. Union's ex-
tensior sorices, described in Arinex 6, provide for one full time village
exirnsion worker duiring the first three months of a T)CS operation, and sub-
seqnently, once fortnightly supervision visits by the extension staff.  Cross-
breeding, calf rearing, animal health, milking hygiene, feeding, fodder
production and mixed farming management would be the main subiects. Practical
demonstrations would be provided through the operation of about 10 demonstra-
tion farms by each Union.  These farms of 2 ha. size would be operated by
tneir owners, under close supervision of the Union and the MPDDC livestock/fodder
crcnsultant, and would be guarant2ed adequate incomes in order to encourage
their participation in the progrrn..
FinanciaL Operations
7.        Equity capital to enable a Union to borrow for investments in fixed
assets would initiallv come almost totally from GovernmTent, except for funds
resulting from the share Durchasfs required from each member DCS.  Lending
institutions wYould firnance up to 80% of the cost of investments in milk plants,
feed mills, technicrl services and, admainistration.  Operating deficits (See
Table 13) w-culd be small in the first two years and are expected to increase
in vear three when the milk nlanv comes into operation, all on account of
small milk volume.  Operating surpluses are expected from year five when the
mIlk from the crossbreeds starts to increase. Operating deficits, including
feed mill operations, are expected to total Rs 3.2 X over years one to three.
These would be financed by equity-capital subscrintions by GO1-GONP to be
reGeemed at rar in equal installnents over vears seven-nine.
8.        Union bylaws would require that 25% of the net income in each year
be automatically transferred to E. Reserve Fund.  Up to 80% of the balance
can be returned to the DCS as a patronage bonus effectively increasing the
members' selling price of milk. Cooperative Unions are assessed income tax
at 44%. Tax liahilities w.7ould be minimized by declaring the maximum nermissible



ANNEX 4
Page 3
bonus while retaining sufficient funds for debt services and future expansions.
The unions are projected to reach and, after tax and after bonus, rate of
return of about 16.7%.  The rate of return including the bonus paid to DCS
would be 20%.
9.        Purchases by DCS of GO1-GOMP equity holding in the Unions are
shown in Table 14. By year nine, it is expected that DCS, applying 80% of
their Reserve Fund allocations for the purchase of Government shares in ths
union, would have a 75% interest in the Union.  Union's purchase of MPDDC
shares would occur from the Reserve Fund allocations in year seven, enabling
the three unions to jointly own 75% of the MPDDC paid-up capital. GOI and GOMP
would hold the remaining 25%. By year ten, when a plant exnansion may be
due, a union is expected to have reserves of Rs 26 M to enable it to raise
funds without Government involvement.
D. Management and Bvlaws
10.       Key requiz, ments of the bylaws governing the Union operations are
summarized in Appendix 2. They provide for limited liability of members,
one vote per DCS, and the constitution of an 11 member board of directors.
The board, to be chaired during majority ownership by the district Collector,
would have the following representation: from member DCS, (6); GOMP, (2);
MPDDC, (1); and the Union's financin- institution, (2).  However, until a
Union has 80 DCS members, there would be only 1 DCS nominee on the Board.
Once the DCS have majority shareholdings they would have the right to elect
the Chairman of the Board.
11.       Operational authoritv and responsibility would be vested in a
General Manager aDpointed by the board working through 5 divisional managers
responsible for Institutional Develonment, Livestock Development, Plant
Operations, Administration and Marketin' (see Chart 1).  The staff of the
union (Table 11) would expand from 100 in year one to about 430 in year five.
Union Division managers would work closelv with the MPDDC division managers
and consultants in planning and implementing their programs.

MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DFIELOPMENT PROJECT
Milk ProcessinR Plants and Feed 'fills
A. Milk Processing Plants
Milk Supplv Projections-Plant CapacitUes
1.        The fluid milk available to the unions during the initial five
years of the project is comnarativelv small because the crossbreds from local
cows become productive onlv in the fourth year which is equivalent to year
nine for those societies implemented in vear five.  Table 4 shows the Pro-
jected milk supplies to the Unions which have served to determine the caDacities
of the proposed dairy Dlants. To reduce operational deficits during the
early years the dairv plants would be exDanded to match the increased milk
supplies. The first expansion from 100,000 lts./dav to 150,000 lts./day
would take place in year 4 and the sezond exnansion to 200,000 lts./day in
year 5. As the Droject would not provide for disbursements beyond year 6,
throughputs and overating results have been based on this maximum capacity
which would be filled in year eight. The milk sunplies expected to continue
increasing beyond year eight would be processed in new Dlants or further
plant exDansions financed by new or or:her loans.
Urban Market Demand--Product Mix
2.        No adequate study has been rTade to determine present and future
demand of milk and milk products of the urban markets in the Project area.
Consequently to determine plant equinnrent requirements a representative
and viable product mix, similar for aLl Plants. was assumed. This is
indicated in Table 10.
3.        As soon as NDDB had been contracted and the divisional managers of
marketing of the MPDDC and Unions had been recruited, they would collaborate
with NDDB in making a market study involving the urban centers and the potential
demand of the regional and national m:Llk grids, if any, to determine the
appropriate nroduct mix for each planw: within the project context of three
unions, to avoid installing excess capacitv in any one plant and to minimize
freight of fluid milk.
4.        General Desin:  The successive expansion of the Plants has been
planned to defer investment and improvre cash flow. However, general layouts
and particularly building design from the very first phase of construction



ANNEX 4
Appendix 1
Page 2
would allow for the subsequent expansions to assure a functional flow at all
times. Civil works, utilities. equipment and dairy processing equipment have
been detailed on the corresponding investment estimates (Table 1 and 2).
Effluent treatment would be of the secondary type either in the form of
trickling filter or anaerobic lagoons. Power would be purchased.
5.        All plants would include a milk drying plant for balancing purposes
and eventual production of infant food, a triblender for reconstitution of.
milk during the lean season, and bottling facilities. For transportation of
milk from chilling centers to the plants and freighting surplus milk between
plants, one road tanker of a capacity of 13,000 liters would be provided for
each plant.
6.        The Unions are only loosely identified with their respective dis-
tricts and milk routes would transverse the district borders as dictated by
the respective milksheds. Existing Government--owned chilling centers in the
region remaining in use would be incorporated as needed into the assets of
the respective Unions.  In addition, the Project would provide for three chilling
centers for each Union for pooling mill: from remote DCS.
B. Feed  u_ills
Balance Feed Demand
7.        This has been computed on the basis of a rate of 1 kg feed per
3 lt of milk, allowing for members that would not nurchase feed. The milk
supply projections (Table 4) have served to establish the yearlv require-
ments of feed, as well as the peak capacities on a per day basis, for each
of the three plants.
Feed MIill Ca lcities and Constructions
S.        The feed mills would not undergo successive expansions but be built
in a phased manner each to its nominal capacitv of 75 tons/day. Accordingly,
the first nlant would be built in years one-two, the second in years three-
four and the third in years four-five.
Feed Mill_Operations
9.        Plants would have facilities for receiving raw materials in bulk
by truck and carry inventories for one month's production. TRquipment would
be suitable for producing tynical varieties of balanced feed formulas with
about 10 ingredients, sold in iellet form in 70 kg bags. To assure regular
supplied of feed to the DCS, each plant would be equipped with its own
fleet of trucks. Income and operating cost assumntions are shown on Tables
9-10.



ANNEX 4
Appendix 1
Page 3
C. Plant Construction
Engineering
10.       The NDDB has developed considerable capability and expertise in
dairy plant modular design and coordination of all phases of construction
with contractors. After having effected the recommended market study, NDDB
would assist the MPDDC (Engineering Division) in Dreparing layouts, building
design and specification of equipmert to meet recommended capacities and
product mix, on which, bids would be requested. Procurement of equipment,
installation and construction would be bulked into as few contracts as possible,
as NDDB, due to previous commitments, would not be available to handle all the
engineering and it would not be justified to build uo the MPDDC Engineering
Division to do this work considering difficulty in recruiting experienced
staff. This would also apply to the construction of the feed mills.

1/ There would be 3 unions of about 4oo + 50 societies each, however all unions a-e assumed equal for the purpose of this model.
/ Based on model of typical village dairy cooperative society Annex 3 Table 3 .
3/ Ratio of milk supply between flush and lean seasons has been assumed to decrease from 1.4 in years 1 - 4 to 1.35 in years 5 - 7
and 1.3 in year 8 and onwards due to introduction of crossbreeding and other inputs.
4/  Determined on basis of average daily volumes during the peak month of the flush period.
5/  Yearly throughput becomes constant after year 6 as project does not provide for further plant expansions after year 5.
6/  The Bhopal and Indore unions would not take over existing government plants.
7/ Computed on basis of 1 kg. feed/3 Lts. of milk allowing for members that would not purchase premix feed.
8/  Initially premix feed would be purchased outside.
9/  To avoid subsequent expansions feed mills would be built to a capacity of 75 Tons/day and come on stream in a phased manner.
The first and second plants supplying feed to three unions would be run initially by the corporation - Each union would take over
its own plant in year 6.

MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Training and Extension
A. Training
1.        The factor most critical to the success of the Project is the
availability of trained and mot:Lvated manpower at all levels. While gradu-
ates in the various technical disciplines involved in the Project are avail-
able, further orientation and job related training would be required for them
to handle the responsibilities envisaged under the Project. In addition, the
task of creating 1,200 new cooperative societies would require acceptance of
cooperative principles on part of 160,000 project farmers, 11,000 members of
DCS management commit-tees and 3,600 paid officers of DCS. This can only be
achieved through extensive education and demonstration, organized specifically
for the Project. Table 1 gives the course content, frequency and training
methods for the various training programs while Table 2 provides a cost esti-
mate for this promotional investment. Chart 1 presents the relative timing
and duration of the training and extension activities relating to a single
DCS.
DCS Level
2.        At the DCS level, the training involves a two-day visit to AMUL of
10 farming couples for each DCS prior to the formation of the DCS. These
farmers would see AMUL in action and cooperation at work. Spending a day at
the AMUL villages, they would learn firsthand about the duties and benefits
involving cooperatives. On their return to their own villages, the farmers
would be expected to participate in or lead group discussions during the
village base camns organized by i:he spearhead teams. These camps, of 4 days'
duration for 3 hours/day, would be held during the period of pre-DCS activity
aiming to communicate cooperative princinles and AXUL experience, identify
potential leaders and build membership in preparation for the DCS operation.
Union Level
3.        At the Union Training Center (UTC), courses would be organized for
training the three-man staff of each new DCS in AI, animal first aid, milk
testing and basic record keeping. These basic courses would be of 2 months'
duration immediately preceding the village base camp, followed by a 1 week
refresher course every year. A one-week course would be organized for the
members of the management committee of each DCS in the village by the Union's
Training Center about 2 months after a DCS had commenced operations. The
management committee from two or three DCS would be trained simultaneously.
The course would use the DCS by-laws, and the record of operations as the
training material and focus on the objectives, potentials and pitfalls open



ANNEX 6
Page 2
to a DCS with a view to formulating an annual plan of action for each individual
DCS. Cooperative principles would also be discussed. A third course also
organized at the Union level would be for the Village Extension Workers (VEWs)
of the Unions. A 2-month course, followed by 2-week refresher courses every
year, would deal with animal production, crossbreeding, fodder production as
well as on cooperative principles and practices. The MPDDC consultants would
contribute their expertise to the course (para. 5).
MPDDC Level
4.        Most of the training of the project implementation teams, the UTC
staff and the extension supervisors would be organized by the MPDDC to NDDB
and NDRI. For the three spearhead teams the program at NDDB would focus on the
AMUL principles and practices and on the exDerionce of NDDB with replicating
the AMUL model. The objectives would be to establish the specific systematic
approach to be followed in setting up DCS, milk collection routes, Al and
animal health services and DCS supervision, etc. (Outline of a recommended
approach to DCS implementation is given in Chart 1.) The NDRI course would
deal with the technical aspects of crossbreeding, crossbred rearing, fodder
production and feeding.
5.        The MPDDC's animal production and fodder experts would organize
seminars for the extension and animal productior officers of the Unions.
The results from Project demonstration farms would be evaluated and other
improved techniques would be discussed at these seminars. Similarly, the
MPDDC Dairy Processing and Dairy Engineering consultants would formulate train-
ing programs for the Union's engineers and plant managers. Terms of reference
of MPDDC five consultants are given in Appendix 1.
6.        A total of 9 overseas fellowships (3 per Union) of 6 months duration
in the field of dairy plant management, dairy livestock production and cross-
breeding, and cooperative communication would be arranged by the MPDDC for the
Union staff. Suitable training courses would be found in Denmark, New Zealand,
Australia and Sweden. These overseas followships would follow a 3-month
orientation course at NDDB, and would be organized in the first and second
year of the Project so that the trained staff would be available when the
dairy plants come in,Co operation early year three.
B. Extension
7.        To spread the concept of crossbreeding, improve animal management
and stimulate fodder production, special extension efforts would have to be
undertaken under the Project. These changes in dairy practices would have
to be implemented in a reasonably short period in order that the DCS and
the Union become financially viable institutions.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Extension System
8.        Existing extension svstems (Annex 1) attempt to cover very large
areas in all kinds of activities, and these tend to be slow in inculcating
new practices. Extension under the Project would be intensive and centralized
under the Union's divisional manager of institutional development.  Training
of the Union extension staff at NDRI, along with the expertise provided by
the consultants and that developed at the Project demonstration farms, would
provide sufficient material for the extension effort, which would need to be
very vigorous during the early Life of a DCS.  For this purpose, one Village
Extension Worker (VEW) would be placed in each new DCS for the initial period
of 3 months.  The VEW would be a member of the spearhead team during the
village base camp and would stay behind in the village to attend to its exten-
sion needs.  The resident VEW would be charged with identifying and training
10 Progressive Dairy Farmers (PDF) during the 3-month assignment. Following
the resident assignment, each group of 10 DCSs would be supervised by one
VEW through 1 day stay at each DCS once every fortnight. A supervising VEW
would basically operate through PDFs, although he would devote 50% of his
time in the DCS to individual member's problems. Each Union Extension Super-
visor would direct the activities of 10 VEW's. Considering the enormous
importance of the farmer's wife in the process of changing any farming or
dairy practice, the participation of the VEW's wife in the extension activities
would be encouraged. An extra allowance in the VEW's salary for such partici-
pation would be provided by the Union.
Selection of Staff
9.        During the 5-year Project development period when the extension
activity is very intense and totally promotional in nature, each Union's
requirement of 30 VEW's in year 1 and 50 by year 2 would be met by the
secondment of VEWs by GOMP to the Union, where they would be directed by
the Union's divisional managers. The selection of VEWs for secondment to
the Union would be made by the Union and would have to be particularly meticu-
lous because of the very demanding nature of the assignment. Factors like
technical training and degrees would be assigned as much importance as moti-
vation, cooperative thinking, devotion to the welfare of farm families and
ability to work hard. The Union would be allowed to pay extra compensation
in addition to the regular salary in order to reward good performance by a
VEW. At the end of 5 years of DAS implementation, the Union would have the
option to absorb as many or as few of these VEWs as it requires into its own
staff with the rest returning to GOMP.

MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ProjectImplementation: Tnitial Steps
1.        The project has a defined scoDe and its entire implementation would
require careful planning with each steo scheduled in a "critical-path" fashion.
The MPDDC and the three Unions would be organized in year one and their corres-
ponding DCS would be implemented progressively over a period of five years,
only the second expansion of the dairy plants would take place in year six.
2.        The Project authority and center of coordination would be the
MPDDC. This would be the seat of the aired consultants and other experienced
executives (divisional managers). They would be coordinated by the Managing
Director. The divisional managers, asSisted by the consultants, would each
carry out a specific phase of the Project. This would be done by working
through his respective counterpart in the Unions who in turn would be respon-
sible for the same specific phase within his own Union.
3.        Major initial steps in implementing the project would be the fol-
lowing:
(a) Government would appoint a kev team to assist in organizing
the MPDDC, nominate its board, establish its headauarters and
appoint its Managing Director. NDDB's services would be contracted.
(b) With assistance of the NDDB, the team would recruit
the executive staff, including three of the five
consultants, for MPDDC and the three Unions, and train
the selected candidates at NDDOB.
(c) The General Managers of each Union and the Divisional
Managers of the MPDDC and the Unions would be appointed.
(d) The headquarters would be established for each Union
in the main urban center of their respective district
or milk-shed regions.
(e) Each Union division would determine its workload,
schedule, staff and other facilities required in co-
ordination with the respective MPDDC divisional manager:



ANNEXF 7
Page 2
(i)  The Dlivision of Institutional Tevelopment of each
TJnion woujld schedule the imnlementation of coonerative
societies, determine strength of sDearhead teams
and arrange for their recruitment, coordinate their
training at NDDB with the teams for the other Unions
and arrange for purchase of vehicles and other
facilities.
(ii)  The Division of Livestock Development of each IJnion
would schedule the implementation of the extension
services:  animal health; Al, demonstration farms,
etc. and arrange for recruitment and training of
its staff at NDTB and NDRI also coordinated with the
teams from other IUnions. Vehicles and other facilities
would be purchased.
(iii)  The Division of Marketing of each Union *Tould promptly
be organized for selling the milk collected from the
DCS in the urban centers. Until the plants are com-
missioned in year two, the milk would be sold chill.ed
in bulk from one or two Union owned chilling centers
temporarily installed in the cities.
(f)  The Division of Marketing ( PDDC) with assistance from NDDB,
would effect a marketing study to determine the most apDropriate
Droduct mix for each dairy plant, to effect economies of scale
in investment and minimize transportation of fluidt milk.
(g)  The Engineering Division ()UDDC) would promptly nrocure and
install chilling centers in the urban areas for sale of
Union milk.
(h)  The Engineering Division (MPDDC) in consultation with the
other divisions of MPDDC and the IJnions would locate and
purchase suitable sites for the bull breeding farm, bull
farms (AI centers) and dairy and feed plants.
(i)  The Engineering Division (MPDDC) would Drepare specifications
in consultation with NDB for calling tenders for the con-
struction of the feed mills and the dairy plants based on
the marketing study. NDDB would also be consulted for
evaluation of tenders received and award of contracts.
(j)  Each union would be formally registered on completing the
implementation and registration of 25 of its DCS (see
Annex 6, Chart 4).

ANNEX 8

INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        Primary Project benefit to the Indian economy would be increased
milk production, mainly pasturized milk and milk products (285,000 tons/year
by year ten). This represents about 10% of Madhya Pradesh's and 1% of India's
present production.
2.        Key assumptions and adjustments made in computing the economic
rate of return were that:
(a) The prices of investment items, operating cost and milk
would remain in real terms at mid-1974 price levels;
(b) Milk production is valued at Rs 1.50/lit., which is the
composite price for ex-plant fluid milk and the portion
of the incremental farm production that does not reach
the plant. Milk products (skim milk powder and associated
butter) are valued at Rs 1.50 liter fluid milk equivalent
which is comparable to the cif price of skim milk powder
and butterfat. In the local markets, the prime impact
of the Project would be a substitution of raw milk by
pasteurized milk, with the excess being converted to
powder and products. Powder production in the winter and
reconstitution to fluid milk in the sumner would dampen
out the wide fluctuations in the price of milk over the
year. Overall, a slight supply effect (10-15%) on prices
would be expected and is included in the price assumptions.
(c) Labor for plant operations and administration is priced
at the financial wage rate, and labor cost for fodder
and cattle-feed production is included in the market
price of these inputs;
(d) Cost of training and extension is charged to the Project,
as are all administrative costs of the DCS, Unions and
MPDDC;
(e) Milk production, without the Project, is assumed to grow
to 3% per annum, which is slightly higher than the 1950-1970
rate of growth of 2%;



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(f) Incremental production beyond year 10 is not taken into
account since the additicnal processing investments
required then are not part of this Project;
(g)  The residual value of the Project crossbred herd
would be the difference in market price between an
indigenous cow and a crossbred;
(h) The expected long-term increase in soil fertility and
crop yields as a result cf the introduction of leguminous
fodder crops and mixed cropping systems is not included.
3.        Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return is pro-
Jected to be about 34% (Table 1).
4.         A sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to costs
and benefits. Table 2 summarizes the results. It costs were 10% higher
and benefits 10% lower, the rate of return would fall to 25%.
5.       -To test the sensitivity of the estimated economic rate of return
to the rate of formation of successful DCS, the following assumptions were
made:
(a) The timing and the amount of investments was not altered
even though investments are to be made in three distinct
phases to match the success in DCS formation;
(b) A DCS was termed "successful" if it yielded the milk
production stream of Annex 3, Table 3 1/ from the first
year of its implementation. An "unsuccessful" DCS was
assumed to take 5 years from the yenr of implementation
before starting on the milk production stream above.
During these five years, upgrading of native cattle
by crossbreeding was assuaed not to take place;
(c) For testing the sensitivity it was assumed that DCS were
implemented at the same rate but that half of all DCS
implemented in years 1-5 were unsuccessful, as defined
above, and thus begin to yield benefits only 5 years
after being implemented. Thus the number of successful
DCS operating from year one onwards was 105, 225, 360,
480, 600, 705, 825, 960, 1080, 1200 respectively, as
opposed to the original schedule of 210, 450, 720, 960
and 1200, thereafter;
1f   Even for a "successful" DCS, it is projected that it would take
3 years before the full level of participation (70% of village herd)
is reached: also it takes 3 years before a native breedable cow
is replaced by a crossbred in milk.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
(d)  The new project incremental milk production stream is
obtained from the new phased formation of "successful"
DCS and the incremental milk production stream for one
successful DCS (Annex 3, Table 3);
(e)  Costs of operation of the DCS, union services and MPDDC
were assumed to be unchanged even when there are fewer
number of successful DCS during years 1-9;
(f)  New operating costs for the milk plants, feed mills, and
fodder production were derived from the corresponding costs
in Annex 8, Table 1, by splitting the latter into "fixed"
and "variable" costs. "Fixed" costs were assumed to be
independent of, and the "variable" costs directly propor-
tional to, the level of operation. The level of operation
itself was assumed to be directly related to the amount of
incremental milk production. Thus,
(i) for milk plants, from Annex 4, Table 5 (excluding
taxes and raw milk purchases), it was derived that
(at most) 30% of the costs were fixed while (at least)
70% were variable;
(ii) for feed mills, from Annex 4, Table 6, it was
derived that (at most) 10% of the costs were fixed
and (at least) 90% variable; and
(iii) for fodder production charged to the project, 100%
of the costs were assumed variable.
6.        Given the above assumptions, when the rate of formation of
successful DCS is reduced to half, but the same number is eventually formed,
the estimated rate of return is about 27% (Annex 8, Table 3).
