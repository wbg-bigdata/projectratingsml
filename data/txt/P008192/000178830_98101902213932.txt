INTERATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPET
REPORT AND RECOMENDATI IN OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS C A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANCO DE DESARROLLO AGROPECUARIO, S.A.,
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA
FOR AN AGRICULTURALL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario, S.A. (BDA) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Venezuela for the equivalent of $22 million to help finance an
agricultural credit project. The loan would have a term of 14 years including
four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A Bank economic mission visited Venezuela in March 1973, and its
report on the country's economic position and Drospects (No. 250a-VE) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on Decemnber L., 1973. A country data
sheet is attached as Annex I to this report.
3.        Venezuela presents the paradox of a country with a relatively high
per capita GNP of $1,060 a but also widespread poverty.    It enjoys a strong
external financial position characterized by net reserves of $1.7 billion as
of June 30, 1973 and a low external debt-service ratio of 6.8%. Serious socio-
economic deficiencies persist, however. Low productivity agriculture absorbed
approximately 20% of the actively employed but contributed only 7% of GDP in
1971; manufacturing (exclusive of petroleum refining) contributed only 13%.
Social indices offering further evidence of the dualistic nature of Venezuela's
development to date, in the light of its high per capita product, include high
rates of unenployment (8-10%), population growth (3.5%), and infant mortality
(49 per thousand live births); and lnr rates of literacy, school enrollmnnt,
per capita calorie and protein consumption, and physicians relative to
population.
4.        The real growth of the economy in the past ten years has been
fluctuating around 4.5%, only one percentage point above the 3.5% population
growth rate. Despite programs of economic diversification, the country remains
heavily dependent on oil, which still accounts for more than 90% of merchandise
exports and two-thirds of Government revenues. The petroleum sector, while it
has been responsible for Venezuela's high income level, has also introduced
special conditions in the economy which have contributed to the underutilization
of potential productive capacity outside this sector.  The exchange rate has been
largely determined by the highly efficient petroleum industry but it has not
/1 1971, according to World Bank Atlas.



been appropriate for the rest of the econonVr, discouraging agricultural develop-
ment and agricultural and manufactured exports, and encouraging excessively
capital-intensive investment. In spite of heavy protection of domestic industry,
there has occurred a long-term decline in the manufacturing growth rate as import
substitution opportunities have become scarcer.  In the public sector, institu-
tional and administrative capability has not developed rapidly enough to absorb
efficiently the growth in revenues from petroleum.
5.        Venezuela's future prospects depend largely upon developments in
the petroleum sector, on the adoption of appropriate policies for bringing
about more balanced, diversified growth of the econonm, and on measures aimed
at increasing the participation of the lowest income groups in the benefits
steming from accelerated development. Venezuela has an excellent resource
base to permit diversification of the economy and especially of its exports.
As one of its efforts in this direction, the Government in February 1973 joined
the Andean Common Market. This will create new e-port opportunities for
Venezuela, while at the same time, expose its producers to foreign competition.
6.        Venezuela has very good prospects for accelerating its growth rate
and for assuring a broader distribution of the benefits of growth. The current
development plan envisages an output growth rate of 6.3%. This can be achieved
if adequate efforts are made to increase the countryts absorptive capacity and
to implement policies aimed at structural change. Since the terms of trade are
imnproving under the impact of sharply rising petroleum prices, grawth in real
incosme is expected to exceed growth in real output.
7.        Balance of payments and fiscal prospects over the medium term will
continue to be dominated by events surrounding petroleum exports. Since July 1
there have been five petroleum price increases by Venezuela, the latest on
December 1 bringing the Government's per barrel revenue to a level of some 90% above
tnat of July 1.  The balance of payments position is strengthened as well, and
Venezuela is likely to accumulate foreign exchange reserves for the next few
years.
8.        Over the medium term, therefore, external financing is not required
to supplement domestic savings or support the balance of payments. Its role
is to helP solve particular institutional problems and launch new programs
aimed at structuraL. change. Tndeed, the Government remains anxious to receive
Bank assistance because of the high priority it places on structural reform,
and the role which it believes the Bank can play in connection with innovative
pro&e.mn, the creation and strengthening of institutions, the objective selec-
tion of projects and the general expansion of absorptive capacity. Whether and
what level of external financing would be needed over the long term depends on
factors which at present cannot be foreseen. High petroleum prices, inter-
ruptions of Middle East crude oil shipments, and increasingly serious problems
of pollution in the industrialized countries could give rise to development of
alternative sources of energy in the major consuming countries which might
alter the world market outlook for petrolem in general and for Venezuela's



-3-
exports in particular. In the meantime, Venezuelan imports are likely to
increase substantially in response to higher income, and it may be difficult
to adjust them to a different foreign exchange situation. In view of the
magnitude of public investment required to diversify the economry accelerate
and sustain a rate of growth adequate to stem the substantial unemployment
problem and alleviate the poverty of the lowest income earners, Venezuela
may, in the long term, still find it necessary to finance a portion of its
development investment from external borrowing.
PART II - BANK GRCUP OPERAT-ONS IN ViEZUELA
9.        The Bank's first loan to Venezuela was made in 1961; to date 12 loans
have been approved writh a total amount of $355.9 million. The overwhelming-
proportion (91% L- amount) has been to finance power, tra>sport, and telecommuni-
cations infrastructure, with the small balance for water supply and livestock
development.  No Bank loan has been made since Narch 1972.  IFC has invested
in six projects in Venezuela, with commitments totaling $29.4 million. As
of December 31, 1972, the Bank's share of Venezuela's external public debt
outstanding, including undisbursed amounts, was 19%, while during 1972 service
payments on Bank debt represented 13% of total external public debt service.
The Bank's share of both outstanding external public debt and annual service
payments is expected to decline to about 10% by 1976 if present trends continue.
Annex I1 contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
September 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. In general,
project implementation has been satisfectory.
10.       There has been complementarity between IBRD and IDB lending.  As of
August 31, 1973, the IDB had granted 28 project loans to Venezuela of which
$177.9 million came from the IM's Ordinary Capital and $152.0 million from
its Fund for Special Operations (FSO). It should be noted that Venezuela is
one of several relatively developed member countries of the IDB whose access
to the FSO is likely to be curtailed under a recently adopted policy; it can
be therefore expected that the proportion of Ordinary Capital loans in its portfolio
will increase in coming years.  Over half of the IDB's loans to Venezuela have
been for the industrial and agricultural sectors, including large amunts to
benefit small farmers. Power and transport have accounted for about a quarter
of IDB loans, with the remainder allocated to higher education and water supply.
11.       The proposed loan aims at further diversification of Venezuela's
econony and is the last operation in the Bank's present pipeline of projects
under active and advanced preparation. Preparation of other projects has
recently been halted indefinitely owing largely to a failure on the part of
the Government to obtain necessary legislative support. These projects were
a proposed secondary level education reform program and a Caracas subway
construction project. An integrated regional tourism project is in an early
stage of preparation and the subject of an ongoing UNDP-financed feasibility
study for which the Bank is Executing Agency.



12.       Taking into account Venezuelats exceptionally favorable external
earnings prospects, high international reserves, and present development
efforts, foreign exchange is not a constraint on development. The justifica-
tion for Bank lending to Venezuela in these circumstances rests on giving
support to institutional development, economic diversification, and social
improvements. But even on that basis, it would not seem appropriate for the
Bank to lend more than relatively modest amounts, with the exact scope of
lending being determined by the degree to which future Venezuelan Governments
pursue ambitious economic and social development objectives. A new Government
will take office in M1arch 1974. We have postponed until then the formulation
of our program for further operations and the determination of-what-additianal
assistance the Bank might offer. In the meantime, we are well advanced in
discussions with the Venezuelan Government and the private banking system
about a public offering of Bank bonds in the capital market of Venezuela. The
amount of this first issue might reach Rs. 75 million (US-W7.4 million equivalent).
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN VENEZUELA
13.       Much of Venezuela's agricultural land suffers from seasonal deficits
or surpluses of water, unsuitable terrain, or poor soils. The mountain valley
and piedmont regions are generally productive and offer possibilities for the
extension of rainfed agriculture, but elsewhere irrigation, drainage, or flood
control is required. Large areas of the south and the east are suitable only
for extensive exploitation in pasture or forest.
14.       As a result of petroleum development, commercial agriculture in
Venezuela is competing for labor with urban centers offering highly attractive
wages. In addition, Venezuelan agriculture suffers as well from the disincentives
of a petroleum-determined exchange rate which discourages exports and increases
the competitiveness of imports. For selected crops these disadvantages have
been overcome by Government investment, subsidies and protection against imports.
The Government's agricultural policy has been aimed at encouraging (i) food
crcp production to reduce imports and (ii) production of commodities with
export potential. Within this production-oriented policy, strong emphasis has
been given to assisting the small farmer sector (paragraph 18).   In general,
a growing share of the budget, ranging from 14 to 19%, is being provided for
the agricultural sector.
15.       Public agencies serving the sector include the Ministerio de Agricultura
y Cria (MAC) which provides general plarning and coordination as well as research
and extrension services; the Instituto Agrario Nacional (IAN) which administers
the land redistribution and settlement programs, and the Yinisterio de Obras
Publicas (MOP) whose hydraulic works division handles irrigation and reclamation
projects. Price stabilization has been the responsibility since 1971 of the
Corporacion de Mercadeo Agricola (CmA), which purchases commodities from farmers
at support levels. Previously the Banco Agricola y Pecuario (BAP), in addition
to its lending activities, had also operated price support as well as import
subsidy programs. The over-extended BAP renained virtually the only source of
agricultural credit until 1970, when the proposed borrower, BDA, was created.



- 5 -
16.       The real value of agricultural production grew by an average annual
rate of 5.1% between 1960 and 1969. This was attributable largely to rapid
increases in output of sesame, rice, sugar, milk, and poultry.  The increases
were achieved more from an extension of the agricultural area than from
improvements in productivity, except in limited areas of land in rice and
industrial crops where greater use has been made of material inputs. More
recently the agricultural growth rate has slowed down to 3.4% annually
(1968-725, while crop outvput has increased by only 1.6% annually.
17.       Although small, agricultural exports rose in value between 1964 and
1967, principally due to sugar and rice, the former being sold to the U.S.
preferential market. Rice exports have called for some subsidization by the
Government, the Venezuelan prices of rice having been higher than the world
market price until this year. Since 1967, there has been no notable increase
in agricultural exports.
18.       Because of the large number of people employed in agriculture, the
sector has a social importance out of proportion to its economic contribution.
Agrarian reform has been a major Government concern since 1958, about six
million hectares of public and private land having been distributed to some
196,000 low-income rural families. Of $531 million in Government expenditures
on the agricultural sector in 1972, some 54% was spent by the BAP, NOP and IAN
almost entirely to benefit the low-income subsector. In addition, the Govern-
ment spends heavily on rural education, housing, electrification, and water
and sewerage systems. While these activities have, by their very size, had a
considerable inpact on the traditional farm sector, the increase in production
has in most cases been marginal. An estimated 66,000 land-reform beneficiaries
have left the land due largely to inadequate size of the holdings assigned - 3
to 5 hectares in areas suitable for crop farming - poor services and low income
compared with urban opportunities. In order to consolidate the land-reform
settlements and raise the productivity of land-reform recipients, a $180 million
Integral Agricultural Development Program (PRIDA) is now underway with the help
of an IDB loan of $75 million made in 1971. The program will include $37 million
for small farmer credit to be made available by BAP. It will deal with an
estimated 50,000 campesino families, and is likely to absorb most of the
administrative capacity available in the country for this sector, leaving little
or no room for additional programs at this time.
19.       Traditional technology and limited long-term credit availability remain
major constraints to increased agricultural production by commercial as well as
small farmers. Until recent years, virtually the only source of long-term
agricultural credit was BAP, whose activities have a heavy social orientation,
emphasizing loans at subsidized rates to small farmers. It is now receiving
further substantial assistance from IDB. In 1969 BDA, owned in equal shares
by the Government and the private sector, was established with technical
assistance from the Bank to provide credit at market rates to cormaercial farmers.
As previously noted, BDA was the recipient of a livestock loan from the Bank in
1972 (see Annex II).



PART IV - THE PROjECT
20.       A Bank identification mission which visited Venezuela in May/June
1972 concluded that shortage of medium- and long-term credit was impeding
crop development. Subsequently, the BDA prepared a detailed project with
the help of FAO and Bonk staff, and this was appraised by a Bank mission in
April/May 1973. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
in September 1973.
21.       A project appraisal report entitled "Venezuela - Agricultural Credit
Project" (No. 224a-VE dated October 3, 1973) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and the project are
summarized in Annex III hereto.
Project Description
22.       The proposed loan of $22 million, to be guaranteed by the Government
which would also bear the foreign exchange risk, would be made to BDA and would
be part of its lending program over a. three-year commitment period. It would
help finance investment for on-farm development and for related processing
facilities.
a.   On-Farm Investments
23.       The bulk of project funds would be used by BDA during a three-year
commitment period for relending to some 550 medium- and large-size farmers.
Medium-size farmers, who have hitherto been unable to borrow from BDA due to
its insufficient funds, are defined as those with gross annual receipts between
Bs 30,000 and Bs 70,000 or the equivalent of $7,000 to $16,000. This corresponds
to net family income between approximately $2,000 and $L,,000 and is a modest
level in a country which offers relatively attractive alternative employment
opportunities in the urban sector. Also eligible for subloans would be farmers'
associations which the BDA is organizing, to include smaller commercial f7armers.
The needs of small-size farmers will be met under the PRIDA scheme (paragraph 18),
with IDB financing, which our project will complement.   Bank staff estimates
that about half the total project funds will be loaned to medium-size farmers
(including subloans to farmers' associations) and about half to large-size
farmers. Annual and perennial crop subloans over Bs 500,000 /1, alone or
together with other subiloans to the same recipient, would require prior Bank
approval; of the $19.8 million of the Bank loan allocated for on-farm invest-
ments, approximately $17 million is expected to be committed by BDA without
prior referrl of subloans to the Bank.
2L.       Lnvestments financed would be mainly cn-farm, improvements for
(i) land clearing and leveling, (ii) irrigation an9d W-rinage, (iii) roads,
(iv) the planting of orchards, (v) mechanization and (vi) storage facilities.
About 400 existing annual-crop farmers, mainly in the western and eastern plains,
would be expected to receive loans, resulting in improvement of about 67,000
/1   Currently the equivalent of $116,000



- 7 -
hectares of farmland. Annual crops grown would be mainly rice, corn, sorghum,
groundnuts and beans. The perennial crops which would benefit from the
project are for the most part grown by medium-size farms. We anticipate
about 70 coconut farms would receive subloans, plus about 40 citrus farms,
mostly located in the coastal region. Other possible perennial crops for
which subloans might be granted are bananas, avocados, cashews and pineapple.
Some 5,290 hectares of land would be expected to be improved under the
perennial crops part of the project. Beneficiaries would be mostly medium-
size farmers, in the 25-60 hectares range.
b.   Agro-Industry
25.       Also included in the project, on a small scale, would be financing
in the agro-industry category, mainly for oilseed and cashew fruit processing.
Increasing production from commercial farming has created a need for investments
in processing facilities for agricultural products. Producer organizations
are keen to establish their own processing facilities, especially for sesame,
cashews and citrus; the existing processing industry has often preferred
to process imported material and is located at considerable distance from
the local producing centers. Preliminary studies indicate that moving the
processing industries closer to the producing centers would be economically
justified. Since BDA has only limited expertise in this field, all subloans
for agro-industry would be subject to the Bank's prior approval regardless
of size. It is estimated that a total of $3 million in agro-industrial
investments might take place under the project.
Project Cost and Financing
26.       Total project cost is estimated at Bs 217 million ($50.4 million)
and would be financed as follows: the Bank loan of $22 million, equal to the
estimated foreign exchange cost, 4L%;   a contribution by the Government of
Bs 37 million or the equivalent of $8.6 million, free of cost to BDA, 17%; a
contribution by BDA itself of Bs 25 million or the equivalent of $5.8 million,
to be raised through a bond issue guaranteed by the Government, 11%; additional
BDA share capital to be generated by the project of Bs 17 million or the equiva-
lent of $4 million, 8% (see paragraph 34);   and contributions by sub-borrowers
of Bs 43 million or the equivalent of $10 million, 20%. The BDA bond issue,
to be floated by the Central Bank on BDA's behalf, is authorized by the law
passed by the Venezuelan Congress authorizing BDA to contract financing for the
project.
Relending Terms
27.       Subloans would be granted for periods of not less than five years
and for a maximum of 14 years, at an effective interest rate of 10%.   The
effective rate would consist of BDA's current interest charge of 9% on loans,
plus a one percent additional charge. A 10% relending rate is appropriate in
view of the average cost of capital for the project, BDA's relatively high



- 8 -
administrative expenses at the present stage of its development (see paragraph
30), the technical services to be provided to farmers under the project, and
Venezuela's relatively low rate of inflation. There is also the need, given
attractive alternative profit opportunities in construction and trade, to
stimulate the increased production of agricultural crops for which a market
clearly exists.
Marketing
28.       Except for a small amount of citrus, incremental production would be
consumed within the country, since for mosu agricultural commodities to be
produced under the proposed project, Venezuelan prices are presently above
the world market prices at the current exchange rate. However, the difference
between the wor'ld market and local prices of agricultural products has of late
narrowed considerably due to rising prices abroad and relatively stable prices
in Venezuela.
Procurement
29.       Formal international competitive bidding is not contemplated in view
of the fact that procurement will be in small lots spread over a four-year
investraent period, the variety of equipment to be utilized, the need to suit
the selection of equipment to the requirements of particular farms, and the wide
dispersion of beneficiaries throughout the country. In most cases, equipment
for land development and construction of irrigation and drainage facilities
would be obtained through existing commercial channels which are satisfactory.
Foreign suppliers of agricultural and other types of equipment are well repre-
sented in Venezuela and there is adequate competition.
Disbursement Procedure
30.       Individual subloans would finance up to 80% of each proposed invest-
ment, with the sub-borrower providing the balance. The Bank would disburse
against certificates of expenditure 55% of the amounts paid out under subloans
by BDA. Documentation would be retained by BLA.
The Borrower Institution
31.       Banco de Desarrollo Ag-ropecuario S.A., which was created in 1969 as
a joint stock corporation, is required by law to maintain a 50:50 ratio between
the shares held by Government and those privately owned. A unique feature of
the in_itution is that each recipient o7 a loan must purchase shares in the
Bank equal to 5% of his loan principal, and these shares are then matched by
an equivalent purchase of shares by the Government.   Besides its share capital,
BDA draws resources from current deposits, savings deposits and time deposits.
It is able to discount its paper at the Central Bank for up to 360 days, and
it receives a commission for managing in trust the portfolio of loans granted
to commercial farmers by other official agencies prior to BDA's creation, at
interest rates of 4% or higher (with the exception of subloans made under
TiSAID and IDB projects). In FY72 commissions for management of this portfolio
represented 60% of BDA's gross operating income. BDA's administrative costs



-9-
have been high relative to its outstanding portfolio during the first three
years of its existence; this is considered justified and is attributed to its
rapid buildup of staff and to the opening of 18 offices throughout Venezuela.
Since BDA's physical growth is expected to be much slower in future years,
and the portfolio would be expanding, we expect its administrative costs to
stabilize and their ratio to outstanding portfolio to diminish.
32.        BDA enjoys a sound financial position.  Its debt-equity ratio was
2.5:1 as of December 31, 1972. Short-term assets were almost double short-
tErm liabilities; and BDA earned a net profit averaging $1.5 million a year
during its first three years.  As of December 31, 1972, some 12% of the port-
folio was in arrears; however, this is a special situation resulting from
successive flood and drought in the western plains shortly after BDA's creation,
which led to deferred repayment of short-term loans for the production of
rice, corn and sesame. The overdue loans are now being recovered and, with
the continuing expansion of the portfolio, we expect the ratio of arrears to
outstanding portfolio to show considerable improvement. Debt recovery pro-
cedures are quite sound.
33.        The President and the General Manager of BDA are highly regarded.
The staff in May 1973 totaled 471 persons, about equally distributed between
the head office in Caracas and the various regional offices. While of good
caliber, the technical staff is insufficient in number to evaluate and super-
vise the number of subloans to be made under the proposed project, particularly
in the field of irrigation. It was therefore agreed during negotiations that
BDA would recruit at least 15 additional project technicians, of whom at least
five would be irrigation engineers or agriculturalists with background in
irrigation. The positioning of such staff would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. FDA has also agreed that a further ten technicians would be
appointed within 12 months after the loan became effective, and another ten
technicians within 24 months after effectiveness.
3h.        BDA's loan appraisal and administrative methods are sound, and the
Bank is satisfied with its execution of the livestock project for which our
previous loan was approved. BDA has agreed that its staff would assist sub-
loan applicants in the preparation of detailed investment programs under the
present project, including farm plans, income and expenditure estimates, and
cash-flow projections.  Subloans would be appraised by BDA on the basis of
incremental returns. BDA has also agreed that, prior to making loans for
groundwater development, it would require farmers to present evidence from a
Government agency that water supplies are adequate, and to furnish satisfac-
tory land leveling maps. For all agro-industrial projects feasibility studies
would be submitted to the Bank.
Drainage lWorks
35.        The Ministry of Public Works has begun to build major drainage
canals in the State of Portuguesa in the western plains, where much of the
investment under the project is expected to occur. IWhile not part of the



s- 10 -
projezt, the completion of this work is considered essential for successful
project implementation. The program of work has been reviewed by the
appraisal mission, and is expected to take three years to complete. The
Coverrnent agreed during negotiations that these drainage works would be
completed in time and maintained thereafter, and that no less than Bs 60
million ($14 million) will be allocated by the Ministry of Public Works for
this purpose during the period 1974-76.
Economic Rate of Return and Project Justification
36.       BDA was created in 1969 partly at the Bank's suggestion.  It filled
an urgent need for an efficient credit institution, independent of BAP, to
lend to commercial farmers at market rates of interest, on maturities longer
than those available from commercial banks. Our livestock loan of 1972 per-
mitted BDA to make its first long-term loans. The present Bank loan would
broaden and extend our relationship with BDA and penmit us to assist it in
the development of long-tenrm lending for crop investments and for agricultural
processing. In the present project, two further contributions are being made:
(i) 13DA will add 35 project technicians to its staff and strengthen its
appraisal capability; and (ii) BDA will organize associations of farmers so
as to make credit available to commercial farmers smaller than those who would
otherwise be able to participate.
37.       By relieving the scarcity of medium- and long-term credit for
commercial farmers, the project would make a contribution to diversification
and to more rapid growth of agricultural output, which is needed to improve
Venezuela's overall rate of growth and to meet increasing demand for food. In
the past, increases in agricultural output have been brought about in large
part by expansion of the cultivated area, while productivity has not improved
much. This project would aim chiefly at raising productivity of existing farms.
Due to.the wage differential between urban and rural communities it is important
to consolidate medium-size farms because there is a danger that they might
disappear if they are not able to increase their incomes.  Significantly., the
farms in the eastern and western plains, where much of the investment under the
project would occur, even when large, are not traditional Latin American
latifundia but are rather owned by fairly recent colonists who live on their
farms and have endured the hardships of the frontier.
36.       The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
projected world market prices, plus an allowance for transportation costs for
the major agricultural products expected to be produced under the project,
with the exception of beans, which have been regarded as "nontradeable"
commodities and for which domestic prices have been used. The project's overall
rate of return to the economy is estimated at l9%. This understates the real
return, since the current exchange rate rather than a shadow rate was used in
translating international Drices into local currency. At full development, the
project is expected to generate about 3,000 additional jobs and an incremental
annual production of about $37 million equivalent.  Additional tax revenues to
the Goverrmient are expected to amount to about $1.7 million equivalent per year.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the BDA, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Venezuela and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreemeni; and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreement
conforms to the normal pattern of loans for agricultural credit projects.
hO.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOIOMThDATION
Li,       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. Projects in Execution
Ln No. 616 Third Highway Project; $20.0 million of June 18, 1969
Closing Date: December 31., 1973
About 65% of project construction work has been completed and traffic
has been opened on a length of 17 km (out of a total length of 21.5 km). Con-
struction works on the reMaining 4.5 km are expected to start by early 1974 and
to be completed by late 1975, about two and a half years behind schedule. Delay
has been caused mainly by difficulties in clearing the land, the need to rebid
sosme sections of the expressway, a shortage of budgetary allocations and heavy
rains.
Ln No. 629 Guri Powerhouse Extension; $31.0 million of June 30, 1969
Closing Date: May 31, 1974
The start of the civil works was delayed about one year due to the
difficulty of the only bidder in providing the guarantee bond. Project com-
pletion is now estimated for the end of 1974, about 15 months later than
appraised; disbursements are presently about 6C of the scheduled level. Due
to the initial delay, difficulty in the cofferdam construction, and recent
currency realignments which increased the cost of equipment on order, the
project will have a cost overrun of about 17% ($10.0 million equivalent); it
will be met by increased net cash generation from larger sales and by govern-
ment contributions. The cost overrun will not noticeably affect the internal
financial rate of return of 17% indicated in the appraisal for the addition of
units 4 through 10, due to higher anticipated sales.
Ln No. 770 Second Telecowmmunications Project; $35.0 million of June 30, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
After some initial delays in procurement which would dela-y some items
of the project by about two years, satisfactory progress is being made. Signifi-
cant benefits will start to accrue from 1974 onwards when a large part of 247,000
additional telephone connections would be given a_- long distance channels
installed.
Ln No. 796 Maiquetia Airport Rro2ect: $17.0 million of February 2, 1972
Closin  Date: June 30, 1975
Progress is very satisfactory, with actual costs closely following
estimates. Disbursements have lagged somewhat, but, due to good weather
construction is now accelerating and disbursenments ~re expected to catch up
with the original schedule.  The runway has been completed and should be
in service early ir 1974. The organization and methods plan is being im-
plemented.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report arny problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Ln No. 807 Livestock Development Project; $11.0 million of March 13, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to a slow start, disbursements are only 33% of the scheduled level,
but subloan approvals are now accelerating and progress is satisfactory. Sub-
loans are being processed efficiently, technical services are good, and credit
demand is increasing. As of November 19, 1973, $1.3 million had been disbursed.
Because average subloan size has been $68,0o0 in contrast to $35,o00 anticipated
at appraisal, the Bank has recommended greater efforts to reach smaller ranchers.
