MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PORTUGAL
FOR A TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION PROJECr
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Portugal
for US$32 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on
standard IBRD terms and would help finance a Technology Education Project.
2.       Background.  A major objective of the Government's economic
restructuring and development program is to increase the competitiveness if
Portuguese industry and agriculture in the world market place and particularly
within the EC. To facilitate this process, the Government is attempting to
establish a more conducive industrial and financial policy environment, as
well as providing the needed infrastructure (both physical and
institutional). The shortage of scientifically and technically trained
personnel and the low level of technological development have been identified
as important constraints to reaching these objectives, inhibiting (i) the
development and improvement of industrial production methods; (ii) the
establishment of adequate product quality control systems; (iii) the setting
up of research and development capacity for new products; (iv) the application
of EC regulations for measurements and standards; (v) the improvement of
occupational safety and health requirements; and (vi) the enhancement of
environmental and pollution control measures. In agriculture, the capacity of
the sector to adjust to EC conditions is particularly weak, given the shortAge
of trained manpow:- to staff agriculturally-based enterprises, in particuldr
food-processing, and to bring modern farming tecehniques, including management,
to the medium-sized and small farms which are expected to be the mainstav of
agricultural renovation.
3.       To address these issues, the Government is undertaking a number of
programs to improve the content and efficiency of the education system,
incliding a series of projects for manpower development financed in part by
the Bank. The Government assigns high priority to human resource development,
in particular to the education and training of scientists, technologists and
managers, and to establishing a well-equipped modern school system which is
capable of developing an efficient labor force. The Government's current
programs include activities to enhance the universiti2s' capacities to train
and upgrade scientists, engineers, managers and teachers, and modernize and
improve the general education system. It has established a network of
vocational training centers with EC assistance, and is fostering closer
linkages of university research with the evolving tecthnological needs of the
industrial and agricultural sectors.
4.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project would continue the efforts
begun under earlier Bank-financed projects to assist Portugal adapt its
education and training system to the requirements of a modern economy.
Specifically, it would focus on (i) rationalizing and strengthening
university-applied research to better meet the needs of industry and
agriculture; (ii) expanding polytechnic agricultural education with emphasis
on practical skills training; and (iii) introduction of the use of computers
in primary and secondary schools.



-2-
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project would improve the
relevance and quality of scientific and technological research anc. training,
and of agricultural education by helping to (a) establish three applied
research institutes with regional branches (in biotechnology, materials
science, and.water resources) and two agricultural polytechnic institutes;
and  (b) strengthen instruction in science, mathematics and language skills in
general education, and increase the number of graduates qualified to enter
higher scientific and technological studies, by assisting 140 secondary and 30
primary schools to modernize the curricula through the use of computers as
instructional tools and for developing computer literacy. The project, to be
implemented over seven and a half years, provides funds for training,
technical assistance, civil works, furniture, equipment, publications av'd
computer software. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$77.1
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$47.5 million (627). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status
of IBRD operations in Portugal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is attached (IBRD #14942R5). The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6617-PO,
dated June 18, 1987, is being distributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project directly
supports Government strategy to modernize its education and training system,
and to develop its capacity for applied research required to support the
development of the industry and agriculture sectors. The proposed project
complements and builds upon earlier Bank assistance in the sector through
creation of new programs to upgrade engineers and scientists, and training of
technicians and skilled workers for industry and agriculture.
7.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government confirmed its
agreemealt on the following actions:  (i) maintain the Project Unit in the
Ministry of Education with appropriate staff and authority; (ii) establish a
board for each applied research institute, with representation from industry
and the universities, and conduct contracted research programs for industry
with cost recovery; (iii) provide supplemental orientation seminars for
instructors of the agricultural polytechnic institutes; select about 302 of
their students from applicants with a farming background; prepare curricula
and equipment lists by December 31, 1988;  (iv) complete an interlm evaluation
of the existing pilot phase of introduction of computers in schools by
December 31, 1991, review the results with the Bank to guide investments after
June 30, 1992, and carry out a final evaluation of this component, to be
completed by December 31, 1994, and furnish the results to the Bank by March
31, 1995; and (v) by December 31, 1994, provide the Bank with its proposals
for generating funds to maintain and upgrade computer equipment use in
schools. The creation of an appropriate management structure for the computer
component would be a condition for disbursement of the Bank loan allocated for
that component.
8.       Justification.  The proposed project would make a significant
contribution to Portugal's manpower training efforts in support of its



- 3 -
industrial and agricultural restructuring. It would contribute indirectly to
the expansion of export-oriented industry and the greater utilization of
Portugal's natural resources for agricultural development. Specific benefits
would be: (i) consolidating and updating key applied research facilities and
increasing the number of qualified researchers trained each year from about 25
to 110; reinforcing research and development linkages with industry and
agro-business; and developing links with overseas research instiLutes to
facilitate technology transfer; (ii) increasing the output of graduates from
agricultural polytechnic institutes by about 120 per year while strengthening
the graduates' farm practice and management skills; and (iii) extending the
use of the computer as an instructional aid to 15% of Portugal's secondary
schools and a small number of primary schools, to improve the quality of
scientific and technical studies.
9.       Risks.  The principal risk associated with the project's applied
research component is that,-because of the traditionally academic orientation
of the university system, the work of the researcni institutes would not find
practical application in industry and agriculture. The project would reduce
this risk by giving industry a prominent role in the determination, management
and financing of research programs. There is also a risk that instruction in
the agricultural polytechnic institutes would be overly theoretical. To
reduce this risk, Minist- Is of Education and Agriculture would collaborate
closely to strengthen the practical orientation of training. The Government
would make efforts to orient instructors toward practical application of
course content, and would open up admission to students from a farming
background. Because of the generally limited experience with the use of
computers in mathematics and science teaching and the potentially fundamental
*          chan6-;s in teaching practices that are involved, the risks associated with the
computer component include lack of teacher and student acceptance, failure to
integrate computer use with curricula, and inappropriate software selection
and development. These risks would be reduced by establishing management and
support services for the scheme, training specialist teachers and subject
advisors, phasing the introduction of computers, and carefully evaluating
school computer development strategies.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
