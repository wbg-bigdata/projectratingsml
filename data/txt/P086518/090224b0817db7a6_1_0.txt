                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer term financing) and business development services, thereby fostering SME growth,
                         competitiveness and employment creation, which are key to achieving GoI's overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. The project is designed to
                         achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a)
                         creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for this project); (b) helping banks gain
                         better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related
                         to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d)
                         strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby helping SMEs to improve profitability and
                         competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.

                         Overall progress on the Additional Financing Project (2009-present) outcome indicators remains satisfactory. Over US$380 million out of US$400 million has been disbursed. Project
                         restructuring was approved on June 28, 2012 and resulted in an extension of the Closing Date by one year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 and a reallocation of proceeds from
                         the unallocated portion ($9 million) to the Credit Facility component of the project. Adherence to project implementation arrangements remains good -- notably the project has
                         developed a model “good practice? Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework for lending to SMEs, with now three financial institutions having confirmed adopting it as their
                         corporate framework. The Credit Facility has progressed well and the unallocated amount of US$9 million that has - with the restructuring - been allocated to the CF would be likely
                         use used for refinancing to enhance the project's demonstration effect.

                         The donor funded technical assistance (TA) component has been closed Satisfactory in October 2011.

                         To allow for implementation of the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF), the project closing date was extended by one year. Initial budget allocation has been transferred for the RSF and some
                         guarantees are expected to be issued shortly. Discussion on the status of further budget allocation will be undertaken next month.
