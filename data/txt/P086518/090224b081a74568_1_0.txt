                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer term financing) and business development services, thereby fostering SME growth,
                         competitiveness and employment creation, which are key to achieving GoI's overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. The project is designed to
                         achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a)
                         creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for this project); (b) helping banks gain
                         better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related
                         to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d)
                         strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby helping SMEs to improve profitability and
                         competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the initial project (2005-2009) by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was satisfactory and the objectives of expanding access to long term
                         finance to SMEs and improving the quality of lending to SMEs were fully achieved under the original parent project.

                         Overall progress on the Additional Financing Project (2009-present) outcome indicators remains satisfactory. Over US$380 million out of US$400 million has been disbursed. Project
                         restructuring was approved on June 28, 2012 and resulted in an extension of the closing date by one year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to allow for the implementation of the
                         Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) and a reallocation of proceeds from the unallocated portion (US$9 million) to the Credit Facility component of the project. Targets with respect to Project
                         Development Objective Indicators have been far exceeded. Against a target of a 30% increase in lending of term finance to SME’s by PFI’s, the project has already achieved a 90%
                         increase by SIDBI at the same time that the profitability performance of benefiting SME businesses have fully met expectations with a 1.07% ROA against the targeted 1%. Non
                         performing Loans have remained excellent (.34%) despite the 320% increase in the number of SMEs that receive funds. Already the AF project has supported over 10,000 new SME
                         loans and the demonstration effect on the sector has been significant with Bank’s learning to take up SME lending on their own.

                         Overall implementation progress remains moderately satisfactory, as implementation of the RSF continues to move at a slow pace. Adherence to project implementation
                         arrangements remains good – notably the project has developed a model “good practice? Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework (ESMF) - that meets country and
                         Bank requirements while being simple and pragmatic having been developed in close consultation with operational credit officers - for lending to SMEs, and three financial
                         institutions have confirmed that they will adopt it as their framework. Moreover, SIDBI has prepared a proposal to mobilize funds to further disseminate the ESMF.

                         The Credit Facility (CF) has progressed well and the unallocated amount of US$9 million has, with the restructuring, been allocated to the CF. Its balance would – to the maximum
                         extent feasible – be used for refinancing claims of participating financial intermediaries. SIDBI has proposed to engage with a new participating financial intermediary possibly a
                         leading Non-Bank Financial Corporation (NBFC) with a wide operational network and a strong Pan-India customer base that will further enhance the project’s demonstration effect.
                         Disbursements to this new intermediary are expected shortly.

                         The donor funded Technical Assistance (TA) component that supported (a) improving credit information, particularly by enhancing the SME database and building an interface
                         between the consumer and commercial databases of the credit bureau (CIBIL); (b) the growth of the SME Rating Agency (SMERA); and (c) cluster development by identifying
                         business development services, was closed with a satisfactory rating in October 2011.

                         To implement the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) an, initial budget allocation was transferred to the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for SMEs (CGTMSE), the guarantee reserves were
                         created and disbursements made from the World Bank to SIDBI. Two MoUs were signed. Despite recent progress, guarantees are yet to be issued and there is uncertainty with
                         regard to further budgeting for the remaining part of the Government’s contribution to CGTMSE.
