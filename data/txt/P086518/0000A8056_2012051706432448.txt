                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer term financing) and business development services, thereby fostering SME growth,
                         competitiveness and employment creation, which are key to achieving GoI's overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. The project is designed to
                         achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a)
                         creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for this project); (b) helping banks gain
                         better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related
                         to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d)
                         strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby helping SMEs to improve profitability and
                         competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the initial project by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) had been excellent and the objectives of expanding access to long term finance to
                         SMEs and improving the quality of lending to SMEs were achieved under the original parent project.

                         Overall progress on the Additional Financing Project outcome indicators remains satisfactory. Disbursement is also broadly on track with US$380 million out of US$400 million having
                         already been disbursed. Adherence to project implementation arrangements has been good -- notably the project has developed a model “good practice? Environmental and Social
                         Safeguards Framework for lending to SMEs. While the Credit Facility has progressed well and has scaled up refinancing activities over the last year, the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF)
                         is a concern. Despite clearance to (re)launch the RSF and good progress on market research and promotion activities, and contrary to expectations conveyed in recent months, the
                         launch of the RSF has not yet taken place. Lack of budgeting for the component has resulted in a significant risk that this component may not be implemented in the short time that
                         remains before project closure on June 30, 2012.

                         While overall project achievements are significant, and while the project has leveraged and contributed to market infrastructure development, cluster development, capacity building,
                         and TA activities (including improving responsible lending practices) and funding (direct financing and refinancing) activities, there is lack of progress on the RSF. It is urgent that a
                         decision on this component be taken.
