                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer term financing) and business development services, thereby fostering SME growth,
                         competitiveness and employment creation, which are key to achieving GoI's overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. The project is designed to
                         achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a)
                         creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for this project); (b) helping banks gain
                         better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related
                         to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d)
                         strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby helping SMEs to improve profitability and
                         competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the initial project (2005-2009) by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was satisfactory and the objectives of expanding access to long term
                         finance to SMEs and improving the quality of lending to SMEs were fully achieved under the original parent project.

                         Overall progress on the Additional Financing Project (2009-present) outcome indicators remains satisfactory. Around US$390.7 million out of US$400 million has been disbursed.
                         Project restructuring was approved on June 28, 2012 and resulted in an extension of the closing date by one year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to allow for the
                         implementation of the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) and a reallocation of proceeds from the unallocated portion (US$9 million) to the Credit Facility (CF) component of the project.

                         Targets with respect to Project Development Objective Indicators have been far exceeded. Against a target of a 30% increase in lending of term finance to SMEs by participating
                         financial intermediaries' (PFIs) funded branches, the project has achieved over a 120% increase in lending by SIDBI. At the same time the profitability performance of benefiting SME
                         businesses has exceeded expectations with a 1.39% Return on Assets (ROA) against the targeted 1%. Non-performing loans at SIDBI have remained excellent (0.53%) despite the
                         320% increase in the number of SMEs that receive funds. The additional financing project has supported over 10,000 new SME loans and the demonstration effect on the sector has
                         been significant with banks learning to take up SME lending on their own.

                         Overall implementation progress remains moderately satisfactory, as implementation of the RSF has been partial. Adherence to project implementation arrangements remains good.
                         Notably the project has developed a model “good practice? Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework (ESMF) for lending to SMEs. It meets country and Bank
                         requirements while being simple and pragmatic – having been developed in close consultation with operational credit officers. Three financial institutions have confirmed that they will
                         adopt it as their framework.

                         The Credit Facility has progressed well and the unallocated amount of US$9 million has, with the restructuring undertaken last year, been allocated to the CF. Its balance has been
                         used for refinancing claims of a participating financial intermediary.

                         The donor funded Technical Assistance (TA) component that supported (a) improving credit information, particularly by enhancing the SME database and building an interface
                         between the consumer and commercial databases of the credit bureau (CIBIL); (b) the growth of the SME Rating Agency (SMERA); and (c) cluster development by identifying
                         business development services, was closed with a satisfactory rating in October 2011.

                         To implement the Risk Sharing Facility an initial budget allocation was transferred to the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for SMEs (CGTMSE), the guarantee reserves were created and
                         disbursements made from the World Bank to SIDBI. Two MoUs were signed and some guarantees have been issued. On June 7, 2013, CGTMSE confirmed the expected scheduled
                         issuance (no later than June 30, 2013) of another 15-20 guarantees, which would leverage the allocation of US$1.43 million to the RSF.

                         SIDBI, with the approval of the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) on June 4, 2013, has requested for a reallocation of US$8.57
                         million of proceeds from the Risk Sharing Facility component to the Credit Facility component of the project. The main reason for seeking this reallocation is that further Government
                         budgeting will not materialize before the project’s extended closing date – a prerequisite for further utilization of the RSF. The reallocation to the CF could expand the coverage of
                         SMEs under the project.
