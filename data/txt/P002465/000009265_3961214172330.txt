PORT MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1723-SO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Port Modernization Project in
Somalia, Credit 1723-SO. The Bank approved the Credit in the amount of SDR 19.9
million (US$22.6 million equivalent) on February 17, 1988. The Credit became effective
on April 17, 1988.
2.    The original closing date was June 30, 1995. Due to the outbreak of hostilities
and the deteriorating security situation in the country resulting in the collapse of the
Government of Somalia, the Bank suspended all operations in December 1990 and
disbursements on March 15, 1991. Final disbursement took place on January 8, 1991, at
which time a Credit balance of SDR 5.612 million (28.2 percent) was undisbursed.
3.    The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) under a parallel
financing arrangement with the Government of Somalia (GOS), financed the consulting
engineering supervision component of the project. Other sources of project financing for
the local cost component came from GOS.
4.    The PCN has been prepared by Sture Karlsson of AF2EI and Samuel Mintz,
Consultant, and reviewed by Stephen Weissman, Chief, AF2EI and Surendra Agarwal,
Operations Advisor, AF2DR. The PCN was not sent to the Borrower for comments
because of the current country situation.
5.    Preparation of the PCN began in late 1995. It is based on materials contained in
the project files and from consultations with Bank staff.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Bank's association with the development of the transport sector in Somalia
dates back to 1964. Between 1964 and 1987, the Bank approved IDA Credits for four
highway projects and four ports projects. Prior to 1973 Bank assistance for ports in
Somalia focused primarily on institutional development and the provision of technical
assistance. In 1973, the Bank approved financing for a capital assistance project for
Somalia's Mogadishu port. An IDA credit of US$12.9 million (359-SO) together with a
European Development Fund (EDF) grant of US$12.5 million was approved. This
assistance financed the construction of a sheltered deep-water harbor. The project also
consisted of a breakwater, two general cargo berths, a livestock berth, a banana berth,
sheds and other facilities. During execution of the Second IDA Credit, the Bank approved
a Third IDA Credit (586-SO) for US$5.2 million in 1975 for additional cargo berths and
extension of the breakwater. Both Credits (359-SO and 586-SO) were completed in
1977.
2.    The Bank approved a Fourth IDA Credit in 1978 for US$5.5 million for the
construction of an oil jetty and related facilities to handle oil tankers and small products
tankers. The project was later redesigned to extend the banana berth and construct a ro-
ro ramp instead of tanker facilities.
3.   In 1984, the Somali Ports Authority (SPA) commissioned the Port Master Plan
study financed by DANIDA. The objectives of the study were: (i) to provide a
comprehensive Master Plan to enable adequate guidance for SPA to undertake short- to
medium-term (1983-1990) planning, development, and management of the ports under its
jurisdiction, and (ii) to act as a planning guide for possible long-term infrastructure
investment (1990-2000).
4.    Preparations for the project began in late 1984. The project followed the
recommendations of the Port Master Plan study. The core recommendations of the Port
Master Plan study were, apart from the need for civil works, that handling capacities and
the performance of the Ports of Mogadishu, Kismayu and Berbera could be improved
with: (i) the provision of sufficient mechanical cargo handling equipment; (ii) the
introduction of appropriate systems and procedures; and (iii) introduction of improved
port operations and management systems through technical assistance and training. Based
on these recommendations, the Bank began detailed discussions with the Government of
Somalia on project preparations and identification. The project was appraised in late
1985.



ii
Project Objectives
5.    The objectives of the Port Modernization Project were to: (i) assist SPA to meet
the changes in cargo handling brought about by new shipping technology; and (ii) to
maximize the utilization of existing facilities.
6.    The project objectives were consistent with a conventional design of an
infrastructure project that introduces technological changes. The objectives would have
been likely sustainable in the short- to medium-term had the project reached completion
and operations not suspended.
Implementation Experience and Results
7.    At the time of suspension of the Credit in March of 1991, a substantial amount of
the civil works had been completed, although the works were more than a year behind
schedule. Most of the buildings, including workshops and stores, were finished and had
partially been taken into operation. The ro-ro ramp at Berth 4 was also completed.
However, the critical rectification of the breakwater subsidence had not commenced, as
the main contractor for the civil works was unable to provide the material and equipment
required to carry out the works. A sub-contractor was, however, nominated and was in
the process of mobilizing piling equipment and material for the repairs, when it was forced
to evacuate the site because of growing civil disturbance. At the time of suspension of the
Credit, the rates of completion for different components were: (i) civil works, 65%;
(ii) supply and commissioning of equipment, 80%; and (iii) technical assistance and
training, 80%.
8.   The key factors that affected the achievement of the project objective were:
(i) recurring delays in project implementation, particularly delays in executing the civil
works and delays in the provision of technical assistance and training; (ii) non-compliance
by the implementing agency with certain covenants under the Project Agreement; and
(iii) suspension of operations and subsequent disbursements following the outbreak of
hostilities and the collapse of the Somali Government.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
A.    Important Findings
9.    Project Implementation Delays. Continuous delays in the execution of the civil
works were caused by the contractor's inability to meet contractual obligations. Delays in
the provision of technical assistance and training were primarily related to the consultant's
difficulties to recruit competent staff for the different assignments. These problems made
it unlikely that execution of the project would achieve its objectives. The delays continued
throughout the project and were not resolved.



mii
10.   Project Organization and Supervision. Funding for the consultant for the
supervision of civil works contracts and equipment, supplies and commissioning was not
made a part of the Credit. These services were initially funded by DANIDA. Due to the
delays in the civil works, and that DANIDA funds were exhausted, and the required
extension of the supervision contract had to be funded under the Credit. This potentially
exposed the project to undue risks had either: (i) contract negotiations for an extension of
engineering supervision services under the Credit not been successful, or (ii) the Bank
encountered problems in coordinating with supervision contractor.
11.   Civil Works. Rectification of the breakwater subsidence was never completed.
The problems with the breakwater was first observed in 1975 when engineering studies
concluded the importance of major repairs to the structure. The repairs to the breakwater
were scheduled to commence at the beginning of the civil works contract, but the inability
of the contractor to provide required material and equipment delayed the start of this
component until a qualified sub-contractor had been nominated. The sub-contractor had
started mobilization of material and equipment when the deteriorating security situation
resulted in the evacuation of all staff.
R     Future Operations
12.  In 1992, under the UNOSOM mission to Somalia, the World Food Programme
(WFP) was able to utilize some port equipment and facilities at the Port of Mogadishu
financed under the Credit. Although new spare parts had to be ordered, part of the port
equipment, particularly a mobile crane, was serviceable. Ajoint UNDP/UNCTAD mission
to Somalia in 1993 estimated that an additional US$8.95 million in new investments for
civil works and equipment would be required to rehabilitate the Ports of Kismayu and
Berbera. No estimate was made for the rehabilitation needs of Mogadishu Port.
C     Key Lessons Learned
13.   The DANIDA funding for engineering supervision became exhausted due to delays
in the execution of the civil works. This exposed the project to unnecessary risks. The
potential risks arose from possible protracted contract negotiations for a non-competitive
contract. Were contract negotiations not successful, this could have exposed the project
to risk and additional costs. The site supervision contract should have been funded under
the Credit to avoid this kind of risk.
14.   The National Transport Study did not appear to have sufficient ownership among
the relevant governmental transport agencies during project implementation. This is
evidenced by the fact the Ministry of National Planning commissioned its own study to
investigate national transport policy issues and to better rationalize transport investments.
It was also unclear what roles implementing agencies such as SPA and MOPVWH would
play in formnulating or influencing national transport sector policies or investment
decisions. This project component was never implemented because SPA and MOPWH
wanted to await the outcome of the study conducted for the Ministry of National



iv
Planning. An important lesson is that studies of this type require better ownership and
consensus building on the intent, need and the roles and responsibilities of the different
agencies.
D.    Achievement of Project Objectives
15.   Overall, the project objectives were not met owing to three major factors: (i)
problems encountered in implementing various components of the project, particularly the
civil works and technical assistance components; (ii) non-compliance by Borrower with
several key covenants in the Credit agreement e.g. deregulation of the shipping agencies
and lines; tariff restructuring, settlement of overdue debts; and (iii) the outbreak of civil
hostilities in Somalia which resulted in the suspension of operations.



PART I: PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
Background
1.    Country Profile. Somalia lies on the northeastern corner of Africa between
Ethiopia and Djibouti to its north and Kenya to its south. It is bordered by the Indian
Ocean on the eastern border and Gulf of Aden on its northern border. The country has a
land mass of 637,000 square kilometers and has one of the longest coastlines in Africa --
spanning some 3,200 km. The country's population in 1990 was estimated at 8.4 million.
The population is unevenly distributed with the highest concentration centered in the south
at Mogadishu, the capital. Hargeisa, in the northern region, is the main population center.
Approximately half of the population are nomadic.
2.    Macro-Economic Situation. The agricultural sector, mainly consisting of livestock
and animal husbandry, accounted for 63 percent of GDP in 1988. Manufacturing
contributed only about 5 percent to GDP of which most of the plants were publicly
owned. GDP in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, amounted to US$210
million. The low level of economic activity in Somalia is reflected in its per capita GDP of
US$170 in 1988, and its average life expectancy of 46 years.
3.    Transport sector. The Somali transport system at the time of appraisal consisted
of: 21,000 kms of roads, of which about 2,460 kms were dry weather roads; three
deepwater ports; and fifteen airfields of which four had paved runways. Despite having
one of the longest coastlines in Africa, coastal shipping was not significant at the time of
appraisal. Until 1990, management of the transport sector was shared by four ministries:
the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Land and Air Transport, the Ministry of
Ports and Marine Transport and the Ministry of Interior.
4.    Port subsector. The three main ports along Somalia long coastline are Mogadishu
and Kismayu located in the southern region of the country on the Indian Ocean, and
Berbera in the north on the Gulf of Aden. Each of these ports are deepwater ports which
handle the bulk of Somali's seabome freight. The Port of Mogadishu is the largest of the
three ports. In 1988, the latest year in which reliable figures are available, the Port of
Mogadishu handled 817,000 tons. Until 1990, the ports were under the jurisdiction of and
were managed by the Somali Ports Authority (SPA).
5.    Origin of the project. The project was initially identified in 1984 following a Port
Master Plan study financed by DANIDA on the basis of Terms of Reference prepared by
the World Bank at the request of the Government of Somalia (GOS) in 1983. The core



2
recommendations of the Port Master Plan study were used as the basis for discussions
with GOS in 1985 on the identification and scope of the project.
A. EVALUATION OF OBJECr1VES
6.    Project Objectives. The objectives of the Port Modernization Project were to:
(i) assist the SPA to meet the changes in cargo handling brought about by new shipping
technology; and (ii) to maximize the utilization of existing facilities.
7.    Project Description. The project components included: (i) upgrading existing
facilities in the Mogadishu Port to handle containers and roll-on/roll-off traffic
(construction of a ro-ro ramp at Berth 4, paving of the container yard, and provision of
fenders); (ii) rectification of breakwater subsidence in Mogadishu Port; (iii) construction
of container freight stations at Mogadishu and Berbera; (iv) construction of workshops
and stores at Mogadishu and Kismayo; (v) construction of a Port Training School at
Mogadishu; (vi) procurement of cargo handling (including pallets), office, training and
workshop equipment, refurbishing of old equipment and docking of tugs; and (vii)
provision of technical assistance and training.
8.    Evaluation of Project Objectives. The project objectives were consistent with a
conventional design of an infrastructure project and the introduction of new technology
and would have been adequate to achieve sustainability in the short- to medium-term had
operations not been suspended. The objective for SPA, meeting the changes in
introducing new cargo handling systems, was on its way to be achieved when the whole
organization collapsed in early 1991.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJEcT OBJECrIVES
9.    Overall, the project objectives were not achieved owing to: (i) problems
encountered in implementing various components of the project, particularly the civil
works; (ii) non-compliance with several key covenants e.g. deregulation of the shipping
agencies and lines, tariff restructuring, settlement of overdue debts; and (iii) the outbreak
of civil hostilities in Somalia which resulted in the suspension of operations and
disbursements.
Project Implementation
10.   Civil works. At the time of suspension of the Credit in March of 1991, a
substantial amount of the civil works had been completed, although the works were more
than a year behind schedule. Most of the buildings, including workshops and stores, were
finished and had partially been taken into operation. The ro-ro ramp at Berth 4 was also
completed. However, one of the most urgent required component within the civil works
contract, the rectification of the breakwater subsidence, was not implemented. The reason
for the delay of this component was the contractors inability to arrange for required
material and equipment to carry out the works in accordance with specified standard.



3
Subsequently, a sub-contractor had to be contracted, which took extremely long time to
arrange for. The nominated sub-contractor had started mobilization of equipment and
material, when in early 1991, the hostilities broke out and he had to evacuate his staff from
the site with the material and piling equipment left behind.
11.   Equipment. The delivery of equipment procured under the Credit was partly
completed by the time operations were suspended. The equipment received by SPA
included mobile cranes, tractors, trailers, forklifts and other minor equipment and spare
parts.
12.  Institutional Development. The provision of technical assistance and training to
SPA was initially delayed due to the inability of the consultant to provide qualified staff.
Around 80 percent of the technical assistance and training was completed when operations
were suspended.
13.   National Transport Study. The National Transport Study, which was intended to
address national transport development issues, including the role of coastal shipping and
the minor ports, was not carried out under the project. This was largely attributed to the
implementing agencies awaiting the outcome of a companion study commissioned by the
Ministry of National Planning.
C. 1MPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
14.   Project Delays. Persistent delays in: (i) the execution of civil and building works;
and (ii) provision of consulting services for technical assistance and training severally
affected the implementation of the project. The completion of civil and building works
were vital for the delivery, installation and testing of cargo handling equipment, and
training of port staff. The adverse consequences caused by the continuing civil works
delays were the inability to store needed workshop equipment and spares, and the
unavailability of a training facility for port staff.
15.   Outbreak of Hostilities. The outbreak of hostilities in December of 1990 in
Mogadishu, Berbera and other parts of Somali, and the resulting deterioration in the
security situation led to the evacuation of all project contractors and consultants as
security situation made it impossible to continue with normal project implementation
activities. At this time, there was also equipment delivered to the site which was under
erection and/or commissioning, and equipment and spare parts ready for shipment from
overseas to the three ports. Many of the companies contracted for works or goods
delivered, or to be delivered, were not fully reimbursed for their services. Claims
submitted to the SPA were not acknowledged and evaluated. It is estimated that the
summary of claims submitted amounted to around US$1.5 million as of January 1994.



4
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
16.   Prior to the suspension of operations and subsequent disbursement of funds,
serious questions arose as to the sustainability of the project, given the recurring problems
encountered in implementation. Operations and disbursements were, however, suspended
following instability and the collapse of the government, and in light of these events it is
not possible to make any evaluation of the projects sustainability.
E. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
17.  Identification. Bank performance in the identification phase of the project was
satisfactory. The Bank played a critical role during the early phases of the project. The
Bank facilitated the discussions leading to the conceptualizing of the project, assisted in
preparing the Terms of Reference for the Port Master Plan study, and assisted the
government in the discussions to obtain bilateral donor financing of the study which
formed the core recommendations for the port modernization project.
18.   Appraisal. Overall, Bank performance during appraisal was satisfactory, although
on the design of the project, more consideration could have been given to potential
impacts and risks of using parallel financing for engineering supervision of the civil works
and equipment procurement. This component should preferably have been funded under
the Credit.
19.  Implementation and Supervision. During supervision of the project, more could
have been done by the Bank to address the problems caused by the repeated delays in the
execution of civil works, as well as in supervising the National Transport Study
component of the project. The Ministry of National Planning (MNP) commissioned a
companion national transport study of its own. As this study was to partly address similar
issues of coastal shipping and port development, the transport study under the project was
put on hold. As a result the implementing agencies were put in a position of awaiting the
outcome of the M1NP's study, which was not completed at the outbreak of the hostilities.
The Bank should have undertaken efforts to coordinate the study financed under the
Credit with that of MNPs.
20.   Relationship with Other Donor. The Bank's relationship with DANIDA was
satisfactory. DANIDA financed the Port Master Plan study, and the engineering
supervision of the civil works and equipment procurement. During the project
identification phase and later during project implementation, the project did not suffer
from a lack of coordination between the Bank and DANIDA.
21.   Four supervision missions were undertaken between the date of effectiveness
(08/1987) and February 1990, when the last supervision mission visited Somalia. This
represents on average one supervision mission per year, but no supervision mission was
carried out during the year prior to suspension. Given the continued problems
encountered from the start and throughout the project with regard to delays in the civil



5
works contract and in the implementation of technical assistance, supervision should have
been carried out more frequently. Taken in its entirety the Bank's supervision performance
during the project cycle was unsatisfactory.
F. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
22.   The Borrower's performance during the implementation of the project in many
respects was deficient. First and foremost, the Borrower, through its implementing
agencies SPA and MOPWH was deficient in its ability to properly supervise the civil
works and technical assistance.
23.   The Borrower's compliance with covenants on financial audits, cargo traffic
statistics, operational productivity data, revaluation of fixed assets, deregulation of
shipping agencies and tariff restructuring was deficient throughout much of the project's
implementation. Compliance with many of these covenants experienced repeated delays,
particularly with respect to providing cargo traffic statistics and operational productivity
data and revaluation of assets, and in undertaking the deregulation of shipping agencies.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCoME
24.   Problems encountered in implementing various components of the project resulted
in unnecessary delays in project execution. This adversely affected the ability of the
project to fully achieve its objectives, despite the progress achieved in the provision of
equipment, technical assistance and training, and completion of the building works and
some civil works. Moreover, delays in project implementation were compounded by the
eventual suspension of operations as result of the outbreak of hostilities and the collapse
of the government. Additionally, the Borrower's compliance with several key covenants
e.g. deregulation of the shipping agencies and lines; tariff restructuring, settlement of
overdue debts; etc., was also unsatisfactory. These factors combined might well have had
an adverse impact on the project's overall outcome, had the project been completed;
however, given the abrupt suspension of the operation, it is difficult to speculate on the
final outcome of the project.
25.   Recalculation of the economic rate of return (ERR) for the project has not been
possible due to: (i) suspension of operations and, thus, project investment costs were not
fully disbursed; and (ii) the benefits were not realized because of incomplete project
components. However, two factors, namely, the overestimation of the traffic in the SAR,
particularly for the Berbera port, and escalation in investment costs, would have
significantly reduced both the individual economic rate of return of the each ports'
investment, as well as the project's overall economic rate of retum.
26.   Given the above, the project's overall ERR of 32%, as calculated in the SAR, in all
likelihood would not have been achieved, even if operations had not been suspended and
the project had reached completion. What is unclear, however, is the magnitude of the
reduction in the ERR.



6
H. FUTuRE OPERATIONS
27.   In 1992, under the UNOSOM mission to Somalia, the World Food Programme
was able to utilize some of the port equipment and facilities at the Port of Mogadishu.
Although new spare parts had to be ordered, part of the port handling equipment,
particularly one of the cranes financed under the Credit were usable. Ajoint
UNDP/UNCTAD mission to Somalia in 1993 estimated that an additional US$8.95
million in new investments for civil works and equipment would be required to rehabilitate
the Ports of Kismayu and Berbera. No estimate was made for the rehabilitation needs of
Mogadishu port.
L KEY LESSONS LEARNED
28.   A project of this complexity required varying levels and type of engineering
construction skills and resources to enable successful execution of the project.
Additionally, the project required the organizational capability and project management
skills to enable a contractor to perform at multiple sites. It also required effective
coordination and supervision by the Borrower and the Bank. Each of these factors was
found to have been deficient under this project. More attention must be given to how the
project is to be organized, managed and implemented by the Borrower, its implementing
agencies, and supervision and follow-up by the Bank.
29.   Proper coordination and control of project implementation actions were critical to
the success of the project in achieving its objectives. Although sufficient flexibility existed
in the Credit and the Bank's procurement rules to permit the supervision engineer's
contract, previously funded by DANIDA, to be funded out of the Credit, the project
nonetheless was exposed to unnecessary risks. The potential risks to the project arose
from possible protracted contract negotiations for a non-competitive contract. Were the
contract negotiations not successful, this could have exposed the project to additional
costs associated with delays in further contractor selection and negotiations. This risk was
not identified during appraisal.
30.   Although meritorious in its own right, the proposed National Transport Study did
not appear to have sufficient ownership among the relevant governmental transport
institutions during project implementation. This is evidenced by the fact the Ministry of
National Planning commissioned its own study to investigate national transport policy
issues and to better rationalize transport investments. It was also unclear what roles
implementing agencies such as SPA and MOPWH would or could play in formulating or
influencing national transport sector policies or investment decisions. The project would
have been better served were implementation responsibilities of this component
undertaken by MOPMT in collaboration with the Ministry of National Planning. Future
studies of this type require better ownership and consensus building. What is required is a
clear consensus on the study's urgency, need and intent, and on the implementing agency's
roles and responsibilities. The importance of this cannot be overstated when policy
reforms are contemplated and investment decisions are to be rationalized.
