PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF PAKISTAN PROJECT
(Credit 1186-PAR)
PREPACE
This report reviews the implementation of Cr. 1186-PAK, which was the
second lending operation of IDA to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
(IDBP), in which IDBP was the sole intermediary. The report covers the period
from 1981 to 1987, during which disbursements under this credit were made.
The IDA Credit of US$30.0 million was approved on November 3, 1981, declared
effective on June 14, 1982, and disbursed until December 31, 1986. An
undisbursed amount of US$0.76 million was cancelled on January 13, 1987.
The previous Project Completion Report (PCR) on Loan 177-PAK, which
was a regular line of credit to finance small private investment, was included
in a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR, Report No. 2555) dated June 22,
1979. Subsequent lending operations for industrial investment, in which IDBP
is a participating financial institution, are the Second and Third Small-Scale
Industries Projects (Credit 1499-PAK and Loan 2839-PAK) approved on June 14,
1984 and June 16, 1987 in the amounts of US$50 million and US$54 million
respectively, and the two Industrial Investment Credit Projects (IIC-I, Loan
2380/Credit 1439-PAK and IIC II, Loan 2648/Credit 1646-PAR) approved on
February 2, 1984 and January 7, 1986 in the amount of US$100.0 million
equivalent and US$150.0 million equivalent respectively. This PCR, therefore,
covers the last lending operations with IDBP as a sole intermediary. It was
prepared by the Industry, Trade and Finance Division of EMENA Region, Country
Department 1, based on a draft PCR prepared by IDBP and supplementary infor-
mation supplied by IDBP, after the review of that draft by Bank group staff.
The PCR was forwarded to the Borrower in draft form for their
comments, but none were received.
This project has not been audited by the Operations EvaluLtion
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF PAKISTAN PROJECT
(Credit 1186-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Credit 1186-PAK of SDR 26.7 million (US$30.0 million), made for the
financing of the private industrial sector, was the second IDA credit to IDBP.
At the time of the credit, IDBP was recovering from its losses due to: (i) the
separation of Bangladesh in 1971; (ii) the massive devaluation of the Rupee in
!972; (iii) the nationalization of major private industries in 1974; (iv) the
external shock of the increase in world oil prices; and (v) the worldwide
recession with its impact on Pakistan's textiles industry. The textile rector,
which then accounted for about half of IDBP's portfolio as well as arrears,
suffered from several years of low international prices and slack demand. So
the Bank support, in close collaboration with the Government of Pakistan (GOP),
was to assist IDBP regain its institutional and financial strength. The
tripartite collaboration resulted in: (i) GOP's actions designed to provide a
legal and administrative framework for the resolution of IDBP's arrears
problems and losses of assets in Bangladesh; (ii) liquidity support and
recapitalization in conjunction with the State Bank of Pakistan; and (iii)
systt.matic monitoring of IDBP's collection efforts. Also, technicai
assistance financing helped IDBP impro've its appraisal and sector work.
2.       The objectives of Credit 1186-PAK were:
a) to assist IDBP to channel funds to aupport investments in the
private iiidustrial sector with emphasis on small and medium-size enterprises
(paras 8, 10 and 19);
b) tu assist IDBP in its institutional improvement, especially
diversification of its portfolio (paras 8, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26); and
c) to help IDBP in its rehabilitation efforts, especially through the
adoption and implementation of an arrear-  recovery program (paras 8, 22 and
24).
3.       The funds were utilized at a slower pace than anticipated, and
although subprojects financed have had an overall positive impact on industrial
development in Pakistan, subproject experience in general has been mixed. Long
implementation 'elays, cost overruns, and lower than expected operating results
plagued many of :he subprojects financed. Some have had positive results,
while some others vhich are still under implementation may have less favorable
results. Major factors affecting this performance were both internal and
external to the subprojects. Internally, they were handicapped by sponsors'
delay in completing legal formalities, and lack of equity finance and
commitment to projects.  Externally, they suffered from an increase in foreign
costs. Finally, in some cases, market conditions and the effects of local and



-vi -
international economic developments were not fully taken into account at
appraisal. However, technical assistance untder the credit was used effectively
and the foreign expert contributed substantially to IDBP's appraisal and sector
work.
4.       The institutional objectives of:  (i) diversifying IDBP's portfolio;
(ii) adopting and implementing an arrears recovery program; (iii) consolidating
its financial position; and (iv) improving its staff resource, which started to
be implemented toward the end of the period under review, were orly partly
achieved. However, the Bank Group's efforts in restoring IDBP's financial
viability have since been intensified under the First IIC Project (Cr. 1439/Ln.
2380). Strong support from GOP and cooperative exchange between IDA, The
Asian Development Bank (ADB), and IDBP had brought some improvements whicn
allowed IDBP to be eligible to participate under the first multi-institutional
Industrial Investment Credit Project and subsequently the Second IIC Project
(Ln. 2648/Cr. 1646). During the 1983-85 period, IDBP made notable progress in
implementing its business diversification program. However, IDBP suffered a
set back in 1985-86 due to the change in its management and lack of a clear
strategy. Moreover, IDBP has not kept abreast with changes in the financial
sector which has become more competitive. IDBP also continued to sntffel from
inadequate recoveries, low profitability and lack of mobilization of oomestic
resources. IDBP needs to be much more vigorous in implementing its
diversification program to survive in a more competitive financial sector.
IDBP's new management has recently taken several concrete steps to achieve its
diversification program. These include recruitment, in June/July 1988, of
qualified professional staff with experience in commercial banking, and in
other product development, such as leasing and resource mobilization through
deposit. Credit 1186-PAK was provided to assist IDBP during its most difficult
period, and it was followed by two other loans under which IDBP has made
notable improvements in lending. Nonetheless, to become a self-sufficient,
viable financial institution, IDBi will need to intensify its efforts in the
areas of recoveries, business diversification and domestic resource
mobilization.
5.       The main lessons learned under this project are:
(a) multi-institutional lending operations allow a broader and more
effective policy dialogue with GOP and serve as a more effective vehicle for
broader institutional and sectoral objectives.
(b) a DFC that continues to specialize in a single product operation
will find it difficult to survive in a more competitive environment; adequate
response in product and resource diversification is needed to enable it to find
its market niche.
(c) restructuring and rehabilitation of Government-controlled
institutions require substantial supervision by the Bank, a strong management,
and full support from the Government; and
(d) appropriate development of project implementation and follow-up
capacity of financial institutions remains an important objective of industrial
development and requires serious attention during Bank supervision.

PAKISTAN
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPHENT AUNK OF PAKISTAN PROJECT
(Credit 1186-PAZ)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) was established in
August 1961 through the reorganization of Pakistan Industrial Finance
Corporation (PIFCO). As a result of the nationalization in 1974, domestic
banks are wholly owned by GOP, provincial governments, and GOP-controlled
institutions. IDBP's objectives have been to assist in the economic
development of Pakistan by providing finance to enterprises normally in the
small and medium-size sectors in conformity with its Ordinance and GOP
priorities.
2.       The first IDA Credit to IDBP was for US$20.0 million (Credit 177-PAK)
approved in February 1970. This Credit became effective in June 1970, but IDA
discontinued authorizizig withdrawals subsequent to the separation of Bangladesh
in 1971. The separation severely affected IDBP's operations including the
loss of its records at head office whidh was then located in Bangladesh.
Subsequently, IDBP resumed normal operations on re-establishment of its Head
Office in Karachi in December 1971, and was able to reconstruct its records.
In April 1974, utilization of Credit 177-PAK was resumed with the conversion
of the unallocated balance of US$10.8 million into a fund managed by IDBP on
behalf of GOP. This new arrangement was devised because, while IDBP had
recovered its operational capability, it was still uncreditworthy (since it
-remained liable for liabilities incurred to finance assets in Bangladesh over
which it had lost control). This is no longer a problem due to the
Government's decision to allow IDBP to service its liabilities in relation to
its operations in Bargladesh only to the extent of the recovery of related
assets. Credit 177-PAK was closed on December 31, 1978, but IDA maintained
close contact with IDBP. In June 1979, the Bank's Operational Evaluations
Department (OED) issued a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR, Report No.
2555) covering the period of the credit.
3.       This report covers the period of the Bank Group's relationship with
IDBP from 1981 to 1987 and focuses on IDBP's institutional performance, the
implementation of subprojects and technical assistance financed under Credit
1186-PAR. The report is the last one in which institutional objectives are
the basic objectives of the loan. Subsequent loans, which were broadened to
include development finance institutions and commercial banks, have addressed
policy dialogue in addition to institutional objectives.
II. IDBP'S ROLE AND BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES
A.       Background
4.       IDBP was established in August 1961 to finance small and medium-size
enterprises through the reorganization of the Pakistan Industrial Finance
Corporation (PIFCO). In 1969, it was 582 owned by the Government and
Government institutions, and 422 by private institutional and individual
investors. In 1974, the private shareholdings were taken over by GOP under
the bank nationalization. The private shareholders received interest-bearing
compensation bonds based on estimated break-up value. IDBP's initial share
capital of Rs 20 million was increased to Rs 50 million in 1970 and in FY81 was
doubled to Rs 100 million. GOP owns directly 90% of IDBP's share capital, and



- 2 -
the four provincial governments and various government-owned institutions hcld
the remainder. As a consequence, there are public sector regulations in areas
such as salary structures for IDBP staff, procedures for managerial
appointment, and a resultant management approach of increasing reliance on the
Government as the problem solver for the institution.
5.       Although initially profitable and financially sound, IDBP's overall
position deteriorated significantly during 1970-1980 due to a series of
political and economic changes in Pakistan. As a result, some of IDBP's
clients found it difficult to meet the drastic increase in their foreign
currency obligations for which they were bearing the exchange risk. Other
clients were unwilling to repay their loans because they knew that IDBP was
unable to institute effective legal recourse, and that further loans could not
be granted due to IDBP's lack of foreign exchange resources.
6.       Despite action by GOP and IDBP to improve IDBP's operations, the
political and economic uncertainties which continued until 1979 negated any
real improvements. This situation was exacerbated by the loss of engineers
and financial analysts for project appraisal/monitoring. By 1980, IDBP was
considered uncreditworthy. Under Credit 1186-PAK, a series of measures to
address major environmental, policy and procedural issues affecting IDBP's
operations were initiated by GOP/IDBP. IDA support for IDB2' through Credit
1186-PAK was based on the expectations that GOP actions would improve IDBP's
arrears and financial position.
B.       Obiectives of the Loan
7.       Although the credit was a single institutional loan, it had some
broader objectives such as: (i) to provide long-term foreign exchange funds
to support investment climate in the private industrial sector; and (ii) to
increase assistance to less developed regions. At the time the loan was made,
it was inappropriate to have a multi-institutional loan becauae continuous
involvement at the institutional level as well as at the macro-economic level
was needed to build up an appropriate forum for effective dialogue. Policy-
oriented lending with multi-institutional scope and specific technical
assistance started in 1981 with the first Small Scale Industry Project (Credit
1113-PAK); since then all subsequent lendings have been multi-institutional
lending.
8.       The basic objective of the loan under review was to provide subloans
to private industrial projects with emphasis on small and medium-size
enterprises, and assist IDBP in its institutional improvement particularly in
its effort to diversify and improve the quality of its portfolio. IDBP was to
adopt an arrears recovery program for which operational targets were
established. The arrears recovery program would be monitored closely through
semi-annual reviews by GOP in consultation with IDA.
9.       With respect to the role IDBP has played since 1982, IDA by further
strengthening IDBP was able to use the institute as a refinancing and
monitoring agency in subsequent projects. Credit 1186-PAK provided a link to
subsequent multi-institutional lending operations which have shown that using
commercial banks as "retailers" and development banks as "apex" could result
in a good blending of commercial and development banking. IDBP was used as
the apex institution under SSI I and SSI II.

III. UTILIZATION OF THE IDA CREDIT
A.       Rate of Utilization
10.      At the beginning of the project. commitments were slower than expected
at appraisal, but funds were fully committed on schedule. IDBP's projected and
actual disbursements are shown in Annex 1 and summarized below. As shown in
the table, by the close of 1985 only 89.9% was disbursed. Consequently, the
closing date was extended by eighteen months. By the effective closing date of
December 30, '986. US$29.2 million was disbursed of which technical assistance
accounted for US$111,580. The slowdown of disbursements was mainly due to:
(i) sponsors' lack of equity; and (ii) a delay in the opening of some letters
of credits by project sponsors.

B.       Implementation
11.      During implementation of the Credit, IDBP's management repeatedly
reqd4sted that IDA amend the upper limit of subloans from Rs 12.0 million to
Rs. 15.0 million and subsequently to Rs. 25.0 million. However, IDA indicated
that such a request was not in line with the objectives of the Credit which
was to provide funding for small and medium scale industries. IDA indicated
that the existing maximum subloan of Rs. 12 million under the Credit should be
maintained not only in accordance with the provision of the Credit Agreement
but also to ensure that one of the major objectives of the credit was achieved.
In spite of the devaluation of the rupee, IDBP's existing exposure limits
(including the Credit's maximum subloan) provided a reasonably wide range of
industries wkiich IDBP could finance. The review of IDBP's pipeline showed
taat it had more than enough subloan approvals below Rs. 12 million to utilize
the Credit 1186-PAK, and the use vZ the ceiling would not constrain IDBP's
jperations.
12.      One of the main problems of subproject review was that IDBP was
consistently submitting applications for approval of subprojects above the Rs.
12 million ceiling, notwithstanding that approval of these projects by IDBP
was an open violation of the credit covenants and IDBP's own operating and
financial policies. To maintain the original objective of the credit, IDA
decided to restrict further access of large-scale projects to no more than an
additional 62 of the total project (at the time of the decision, large-scale
enterprises represented 49% and SSI's 51X). IDA also made a number of
requests to IDBP to review its role and scope in financing of industrial
sector projects, but IDBP did not make an attempt to prepare such a review.



- 4-
C.       Subproiects Review Process
13.      Fifty-nine subprojects were approved under the subloan component of
the Credit; however, 4 projects were cancelled leaving a total of 55
subprojects. Disbursements of US$28.3 million (SDR 25.9 million) were for 55
subprojects. Of this, 2c subprojects involving foreign currency funds
aggregating US$5.6 milli4on were disbursed by IDBP -der the free limit"' and
the remaining 26 subprojects amounting to US$22.7 million were referred to IDA
for review prior to their approval. A list of subprojects disbursed is given
at Annex 2.
14.      IDBP extended the facility of financial assistance for the purchase of
machinery both in foreign and local currencies. Formal procedures were evolved
to select quality machinery at competitive prices and a committee to check the
price of biddings was formed (see Annex 5 for procurement procedures). The
projects that required international tendering, competitive quotations from
five sources and those that required competitive quotations from at least three
sources are also given in Anuex 5.
15.      A summary showing overall experience with subproject operations is
given
in Annex 6. Out of 27 projects submitted to IDA, 12 were accepted without
additional information. For the remaining 15, IDA proposed suggestions to
improve observed weaknesses. Weaknesses were in the area of market forecasts,
financing plans, and project cost estimates. Although IDBP has made progress
in terms of its appraisal standards, weaknesses remain in analysis and
realistic assessment of the following: (i) implementation time; (ii) market
prospects; (iii) economic aspects of projects; (iv) follow-up; and (v)
monitoring the processing of feedback information during implementation of
projects. Economic rate of return estimates of the 27 projects ranged from
121 to 362 and the financial rates of return were estimated to be in the range
of 17X to 47X.
D.       Characteristics and Performance of Subprolects
16.      In line with its policy of portfolio diversification, IDBP disbursed
the funds of the Credit 1186-PAK in favor of diverse forms of manufacturing
projects.  The relevant figures appear in Annex 3 and are summarized below.
Although emphasis on project promotion and development activities helped
improve the quality of projects and IDBP's portfolio, IDBP needs to continue
its diversification in accordance with its strategy statement and priorities
(para. 40).

17.      Since its inception, IDBP has financed mostly new enterprises rather
than existing ones and this was the same under Credit 1186-PAK, which was for
new and existing enterprises, as shown on the table below.  This distribution
of the portfolio can be explained by the fact that: (a) IDBP was new in the
financing of the industrial sector, and (b) the way IDBP defined its role as a
development institution. This concentration on new projects partly explains
why IDBP's portfolio is in bad shape. New projects present higher risks as
well as higher operational costs. Consequently, IDBP needs to diversify its
product mix and engage in financial operations which are more profitable
(para. 40).

18.      Since the mid-1970s, IDBP has played a positive role in the
development of small and medium-scale industries (SSI), although more recently,
in line with the changes in the financial sector, a large part ot SSI
requirements are financed by the National Commercial Banks-'. As a result,
IDBP has tended to concentrate more of its lending operations on medium to
-lo Credit 1186-PAK stipulated that subloans to the textile sector would not
exceed 35 percent of the subloan component of the credit.
2' There has been diversification of functions by the institutions in the
system. Commercial banks provide term financing to agriculture and
industry. Development finance institutions complement their assistance
with short term working capital loans. Investment banks rely on
commercial banks to back up their underwriting commitments. Leasing
companies are being established by commercial banks and DFIs.



large-scale capital intensive projects. Under Credit 1186-PAK, most of the
loan amount went to SSI, the ave-age size is US$0.515 million. As shown in
Annex 3, 69% of the 55 projects were disbursed for loans up to US$1 million
and 31% of projects were advanced for loans ranging between US$1 to 2 million.
19.      The geographical distribution reflects the credit objectives to direct
lending operations to the less developed provinces. As part of its investment
strategy, IDBP has always made a special effort in promoting the growth of
industrialization as evenly and equitably as possible in all provinces of the
country aad in particular in Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Baluchistan
and less developed areas of Sind and Punjab.  The outcome of IDBP efforts,
however, depends upon the response of the private entrepreneurs. IDBP's
initiatives such as preparation and dissemination of industrial profiles and
other promotional measures have proved to be very helpful in this regard. Of
the total amount of subloans disbursea out of the 1DA Credit, 44% was directed
to projects located in the province of Punjab and 23% to projects belonging to
Sind. Subprojects located in Baluchistan and NWFP accounted for 16 and 17%,
respectively. This pattern is consistent with population distribution, and
IDBP has continued to expand its lending operations in NWFP and Baluchistan.
20.      During implementation of the credit, serious time lag and cost
overruns occurred. As a result, some projects are highly leveraged because the
financial gap is covered by IDBP even though debtiequity ratio should be around
60/40%. IDBP does not require that project sponsors deposit part of their
equity in an account before they can use the loan money. Consequently, if
there is a time lag ' and/or cost overruns, IDBP must finance the financial
gap in order to complete the project, and this leaves no incentive for the
sponsor to complete the project on time. A sponsor does not have any financial
risk because he has not utilized all of his money yet. Solutions to this
problem are proposed under the proposed IIC III. Out of the 55 proje_.ts
financed, 38 have been completed (Annex 4). An examination of these 38
projects shows that 27 projects were not completed on time. A time lag of up
to 15 months was observed in 20 projects, a time lag of 16 months to 2.5 years
in six projects and above three years in the case of one project. Time lag
was mainly attributed to delays in: (i) construction of factory building;
(ii) opening of letters of credit; (iii) shipment of machinery; (iv)
completion of departmentation formalities; (v) procurement of land; (vi)
findiij- of own share capital; (vii) tendering, non-availability of
infra-structure facilities; and (viii) management turnover. The aggregate
average cost overrun was 22% against appraisal estimates for the 38 completed
projects.  Out of the 38 projects, seven projects were completed within the
original cost estimates. In the case of the remaining 31 overruns, up to 10
percent over the estimated cost were observed in 15 cases, between 11 to 20
percent in six cases, 21 to 30 percent in four cases, and above 30 percent in
six cases (Annex 4). Some major factors attributable to cost overruns were:
(i) changes in the original financing plans; (ii) purchases of additional
land; and (iii) under estimations of price and physical contingencies.
21.      The implementation performance of subprojects financed reveals mixed
results of the industrial development impact (Annexes 7-8). However, it is too
'L.-    When there is a time lag, there is usually an increase in cost of
machinery.



early to have a definite picture because the data base is incomplete. Out of
the 55 projects financed, only 13 entered production stage and have now
completed a full year of operation. Average initial capacity utilization was
about 55% compared to an jstimate of 66X&' and only 272 of the companies are
exporting as compared to the estimates at the time of appraisal. Total
employment created by the 13 projects was 2,467 vs 2,146 at appraisal, and the
actual investment cost per worker ranged between Rs. 0.400 million and Rs.
0.07 million against estimates of Rs. 0.375 million and 0.042 million. Total
sales of the 13 projects exceed the estimated sales at the time of appraisal
by 8.5X. However, 7 subprojects experienced losses, 5 had profits which were
about 50% lower than the estimate, and one made profits 422 above the
estimate. The estimated value added of Rs. 154.8 million turned out to be
lower than the actual Rs. 189.9 million. IDBP could not explain the variances
between estimaced and actual performances. Appropriate development of
monitoring systems and systematic assessment of client company performance in
comparison to appraisal estimates require more attention from IDBP
management. Improvement in this area will be of great help to IDBP's
clients. These issues are captured under the Second Industrial Investment
Credit, (IIC II, Loan 2648/Credit 1646).
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
A.       Major Institutional Problem Areas
22.      IDBP has had operational, financial and organizational problems, but
the most serious problems have been the high level of arrears and the need to
diversify its portfolio. Hence, one of the objectives of the IDA Credit was
to help IDBP regain its creditwort'.iness and recover from the shocks caused by
the separation of the Eastern Wing. While there has been significant progress
in restoring IDBP on a profitable pa.h with the help of IDA, ADB, and GOP, IDBP
continues to suffer from structural weaknesses.
23.      During the 1982-83 period, the situation had deteriorated so badly
that the Bank group felt that unless ID3P developed the capability to (i)
complement its traditional foreign currency term financing with short and long-
term rupee financing; and (ii) offer a wide range of other banking services to
its clients, it would gradually be forced into a secondary financing role by
the more dynamic institutions. As a result, IDBP would be forced to invest in
marginally viable projects with high risks in order to maintain the size of its
operations. It was also felt that the organizational, functional, personnel
development and staff morale problems could not be effectively addressed in
the context of the present level of operations. These problems were also
responsible for low productivity and lack of professionalism in many of IDBP's
activities, reducing management's effectiveness in all areas. IDBP was
restructured by ADB and the Bank Group (First IIC loan) at the end of 1983,
and in 1984-85 additional measures were agreed upon under IIC II. As a
result, IDBP's financial performances improved (paras. 26-28). Nonetheless,
since 1986, initial liquidity problems have resurfaced because IDBP did not
implement its business diversification program due to change in management and
lack of a clear strategy. It is now obvious that IDBP cannot continue in its
present

form. The institution should diversify its product and resource mix and use
the right people to complete its diversification (para. 40).
24.      The ?oor quality of IDBP's portfolio has been a serious challenge for
IDBP's managerwnt especially since it has led to severe liquidity problems.
For IDBP to survive and prosper, it has no other obvious choice but to
vigorously address its arrears problems and ensure that its new loans are of
higher quality. Furthermore, to maintain its liquidity position, IDBP will
need to collect at least 75% of the amount falling due on new loans (each
subsequent loan from the Bank has stressed this point). However, in the
1981-86 period, IDBP's collection has varied between 47% to 75X. In fact, IDBP
did not become eligible to participate in the Second Industrial Investment
Credit (IIC II) until October 1985 when the end of the year collection
performance was reviewed. Cash collection for FY86 was marginally below the
target of Rs. 500 million, and slightly below the 75% recovery ratio required
for participation in IIC II.
25.      The Bank Group has expressed its disappointment about the low
collection ratio and has asked IDBP to take drastic measures in order to remain
a more vibrant and competitive financial institution.  Under the proposed IIC
III, IDBP has to implement rapidly its-business diversification, resource
mobilization and arrears recovery programs (para. 40) in order to be
considered a participant. IDBP has recently submitted a time-bound
diversification action plan, but more importantly, has taken some concrete
measures (para. 26).
B.       Institutional Achievements
26.      During the 1984-1985 period, IDBP made progress in achieving its
objectives of restoring its financial health, revitalizing its managerial
capacity and participating more actively in the country's industrial
development process. The progress which was stopped due to a change in
management was the result of a concerted effort by GOP, the Bank Group, ADB and
IDBP itself. Although the institution has been experiencing a setback since
1985, on the resource side, IDBP was able to mobilize additional deposits which
represented about 46% of total deposits in 1986; nevertheless, SBP lines of
credit continue to be IDBP's principal source of rupee funds. Also, IDBP
increased its working capital loans to a significant level. More recently, in
line with the conditions laid down under the proposed IIC III, IDBP has
established a commercial banking department at its headquarters to handle
working capital financing, underwriting, bridge and export/import financing.
It has also taken action to activate its merchant banking (leasing and
underwriting).
27.      Over the years, IDBP established some changes in the organization and
management structure of the institution in order to streamline its
operations. One such change was decentralization of loan approval authority.
Given the significant expansion of IDBP's operations, GOP has agreed under the
IIC II project, that any appointee to the position of Chief Executive would
have qualifications and experience appropriate for the position. Staffing
continues to be satisfactory for IDBP's traditional lending operations, but
for implementation of product and resource diversification, IDBP does not have
the in-house talent (para. 40). In its action plan for diversification of
services (paras. 25 and 26), IDBP intends to recruit or start training staff
by mid-1988. This staff will be used for implementing its diversification.
IDBP has continued its policy of rotation of professional staff among
departments *nd between regional offi:-es to give them greater exposure and

experience. Staff turnover has come down from that experienced in previous
years. In 1986, the bulk has been due to retirement, death, or terminations
rather than resignations. The institution has been successful in recruiting
professionals with experience in large-scale project appraisal and computer
system applications. Training has been provided in house as well as
externally.
28.      IDBP participation in tha Second Industrial Investment Credit, under
which IDBP had to meet specific agreed collection targets, help>.-' the recovery
process. Semi-annual review meetings and collection performance contributed
to a more effective monitoring of progress in this area and offered regular
opportunities for discussion of specifications to improve IDBP's financial
performance.
29.      GOP's contribution to the resolution of the legal disputes on
repayment obligations of IDBP's clients, and the appointment of a special
judge'to exclusively handle cases of IDBP's loan defaulters, highlight the
importance of strong government commitment to IDBP's rehabilitation efforts.
To help improve its arrears situation, IDBP intends to (i) request GOP's
agreement to convert old loans not under the umbrella of the FERC program into
rupee obligations; (ii) vigorously pressure overdue accounts and settle out of
court on as many as possible and close the books on them; and (iii) write off
the significant portion of arrears that will be uncollectible.
V. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.       Operational Performance
30.      IDBP's projected and actual lending operations for 1982 to 1986 are in
Annex 9 and are summarized below. As shown in the table, although total annual
approval of foreign exchange loans were exceeded in FY84 and FY86, commitments
and disbursements have been lagging behind since the time of appraisal,
especially those related to the foreign exchange. The main reasons for the
disappointing performance have been world-wide economic recession, IDBP's
financial and institutional problems, and lack of foreign currency resources
which IDBP could not secure as planned; nonetheless, the foreign exchange
amount of Credit 1186-PAK was adequate. The three main characteristics of
IDBP's operations are:  First, its main clients by amount are now medium and
large industries; and lending to SSI is no longer IDBP's main business.
Second, sectoral distribution which has been based heavily toward cotton and
the textile sectors has shifted towards greater diversification in accordance
with IDBP's strategy statement. Textiles, which accounted for 372 of the
total flow in 1981, is now representing only about 92 of IDBP's assistance.
Third, loans to new projects have averaged about 75% of total approvals, while
expansion/rehabilitation projects account for about 25X, which partly
explained the bad quality of the portfolio (para. 17).

B.       Financial and Organizational Performance and Prospects
31.      IDBP's financial performance was severely affected by its poor
collec.ion performance which reduced its liquidity position. From FY81 to
FY86, the collection ratio was less than the 752 which was needed to stop an
increase in the level of arrears (Annex 15). During 1981-83, IDBP had to face
external and internal problems. The bad cotton year of 1983 affected adversely
the ability of many of IDBP's borrowers to meet their obligations.'' As the
result, IDBP's financial position could not be improved. The institution had
also to address problems in the areas of its: (i) operating policies and
strategy which did not reflect the changes taking place in the financial
delivery system; (ii) organization structure; and xiii) staffing level and the
operational distribution of staff. Consequently, some of the improvements
expected from GOP/IDBP actions did not materialize.
32.      The Bank, with ADB, restructured IDBP in 1983 (first IIC project,
Loan 2380-PAK/CR. 1439-PAK); as a result, its financial performance improved
notably. However, since 1986, the institution is experiencing the old
structural problems. In FY84, IDBP collected Rs. 361 million which was below
its target of Rs. 375 millionl' agreed under Cr. 1186-PAK. IDBP started a
strategy of diversification of its loan portfolio and financial resources and
intensified its promotion efforts by undertaking subsector work. IDBP lent
only about 12Z to the textile sector and raised Rs. 250 million. These funds
were in turn used for working capital loans. Accordingly, working capital
loans increased from Rs. 89 million as of June 30 1984, to Rs. 270 million as
of December 30, 1984. In-house and overseas training courses were arranged
and the foreign consultants under Credit 1186-PAK made positive contributions
to IDBP's project appraisal and sector work. However, since 1986, IDBP has
been losing ground. The shift from crisis management to strategic management
has not been achieved. IDBP's present financial situation is of serious
concern and could be detrimental to the survival of the institution. The new
management is aware of the crisis and has recently proposed an action plan and
taken several concrete actiona (paras 25 and 26).
33.      As shown in the table below, the Arrears Recovery Program (ARP), as
agreed under Credit 1186-PAK, was unsuccessful. None of the operational
targets was reached due to the institution's financial, operational and
organizational problems (paras. 22-24). Had the ARP been successful, the cash
collection for which targets were set in term of amount and changed
subsequently to percentages would still have been too low to compare to the
losses due to rise in arrears. The targets were too low aad were intended to
be only floor rather than ceiling. The spread is 1.2% which barely covers the
administrative cost of l.lZ. At present, IDBP needs to have a more selective
lending procedure and lend only to projects which are financially and
economically sound. Of the Rs. 1.2 billion of suits filed for
IDBP has a big proportion of its loans lent to textile manufacturing
enterprises, which were hit by drastic, unexpected price increases in
raw materials.
2/      Under IIC I Loan 2380-PAK/Cr. 1439-PAK, IDBP's target for 1984 was
modified to Rs. 365 million in order to account for new development.

collection of overdues as of December 31, 1982, IDBP collected only 0.4
billion (397 of total dues) as of December 31, 1-86.  On one hand, cases under
litigation decreased from 160 in 1981 to 143 in 986; on the other hand,
closed units and problem projects in operation increased from 109 to 117 and
from 62 to 131 respectively during the same period (Annex 13).
34.     Although IDBP's financial position has improved during the 1984-1985
period, due to GOP's arrears recovery program, which included credit
curtailment, rescheduling and investment sanctions, it is still inadequate and
requires careful monitoring. Particular care will be needed to ensure that
the level of collections on arrears is considerably improved (particularly
collections of current dues). As a result of the GOP arrears recovery program,
IDBP's total arrears (principal and interest) have rallen from Rs. 1.8 billion
(FY81) to Rs. 0.9 billion (FY86) or by 50%, and arrears as a percentage of the
portfolio have fallen from 46X (FY81) to 202 (FY86).  While this is an
improvement over past collection performance, collections on current dues must
increase above 757 to contain any increase in the overall level of arrears and
to maintain the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.1. This, in turn, is
necessary if IDBP is to break even on its operations and remain financially
viable.

35.      Summaries of IDBP's financial statements are given in Annexes 10 and
11 and are summarized above, see para 34. They show that since FY81, IDBP's
profitability has improved, with net profits after tax increasing from Rs. 5
million (FY81) to Rs. 67 million (FY86).  During FY81-FY86, total assets
increased from Rs. 2.1 billion to Rs. 5.5 billion, an average growth of 21%
p.a. in nominal terms. With the improved profitability, ROE increased from 31
(FY81) to 162 (FY86), while IDBP's debt: equity ratio dropped below the
prescribed limit of 5:1. Although IDBP profitability has improved, more needs
to be done for the institution to become and remain financially viable (paras
33 and 34).
VI. IDA PERFORMANCE AND IDBP's FUTURE CHALLENGES
A.       IDA Performance
36.      IDA's understanding of IDBP's sector priorities, financial and
operational problems and the resultant project and loan conditions were
appropriate in view of IDA's knowledge of the general circumstances at the
time of ampraisal. However, subsequent changes in the industrial and
financial-' sector have modified the original emphasis and have made the
Bank Group change its approach to the industrial lending. The Bank Group's
approach to industrial lending has now shifted from individual relationships
with the DFIs (as reflected in the direct lending operations to IDBP, of which
Cr. 1186-PAK was the last) to a focus on the industrial finance system as a
whole. The multi-institutional approach allows a bioader and more effective
policy dialogue with GOP. This also benefits the individual institution.
Some of the recent improvements on regulations affecting DFIs have been
brought about by a concerted effort to integrate the DFIs more with the new
financial system. In the case of IDBP, this meant, for instance, permission
to participate in the interbank market to strengthen its local currency
resource base, to provide short-term working capital, and to offer a broader
spectrum of banking services to its clients.
37.      Overall results suggest that project objectives, especially
operational targets set out at the time of appraisal, were overly ambitious to
be accomplished during the period of the project. IDBP could not achieve the
targets agreed upon due to: (i) its financial and operational problems which
has worsened; and (ii) competitiotn from commercial banks which have been
providing term lending to agricultiure and industry. IDA recognized the
problems and modified the targets accordingly. However, the targets set were
intended to be floor rather than ceiling, so they turned out to be too low
(para. 33).
While domestic resources for term financing has not been a constraint
in recent years, industrial investment has been hampered by
weaknesses in the credit delivery system. With the accelerated pace
of industrial investment since 1981, most investments have been
financed through debt due to: (i) lack of equity finance from the
formal capital markets; and (ii) a continuing reluctance of
entrepreneurs to provide adequate equity contributions for longer-term
industrial investments. The Bank Group's assistance has, therefore,
been increasingly linked with efforts to: (i) expand the number of
channels for industrial finance; (ii) encourage competition among
various financial institutions; and (iii) strengthen industrial
lending capabilities of major financial intermediaries.

38.      During implementation of the Credit, IDBP requested an amendment of
the upper limit of subloans from Rs. 12.0 milion to Rs. 15.0 million ana
subsequently to Rs. 25.0 million. IDA, rightfully, rejected the request on
the ground that it was not in line with the objectives of the
credit--especially since IDBP's pipeline showed more than enough subloan
approvals below Rs. 12.0 million--and indicated that constant submission of
applications for approval of subloans above the Rs. 12.0 million ceiling was
an open violation of the credit covenants and IDBP's own operating and
financial policies (paras. 13-14).39.    IDA supervision was adequate.  In
fact, supervision was intensified during the second-phase of the project
implementation due to problems that IDBP has been experiencing. IDA and I'DBP
staff worked very closely to find solutions to the institution's business
diversification and arrears problems. IDA's most significant contribution
during the life of the project was to assist IDBP in its restructuring and
rehabilitation efforts.
B.       IDBP's Future Challenges
40.      IDBP's management must try to (i) strengthen its financial position;
(ii) diversify its business; (iii) rationalize its management structure; and
(iv) hire qualified professional staff with greater experience in resource
mobilization and business diversification. Furthermore, for IDBP to play a
role in the financing of the private industrial sector, it would need to take
some of the following actions:
a)   Concerning its arrears, IDBP needs to focus its collection
effort on two aspects of its portfolio. It needs to contain
risk exposure by a more conservative lending criteria for new
loans and aggressive portfolio management of existing loans.
New lendings have to be free of problems, collection of post
1981 should be greater than 75% because at 751 collection rate,
the incremental spread is only 1.21. This spread barely covers
IDBP's administrative cost of 1.1 to allow for adequate
provisior.s and profit. Old loans (pre-1981) should be reviewed
on a case by case basis, so IDBP could decide whether: (i) to
write off, (ii) to reschedule, or (iii) to liquidate. IDBP also
needs to press for a solution to the repercussions of foreign
exchange fluctuations on its older portfolio, not covered by
FERC, and which largely corresponds to a good portion of
accounts in arrears. On the basis that corresponding foreign
liabilities have been repaid by IDBP, it can seek some form of
general or selective conversion of subloans to rupee obligations
to facilitate collection, either by legal action or rescheduling
or restructuring arrangements. A proposal in this respect has
been presented by IDBP to GOP;
b)   concerning its resource mobilization, IDBP needs to increase its
domestic resource to an acceptable level. IDBP could attract
deposits and other fee based activities by lending to projects
with emphasis on urban areas and/or to clients with larger
accounts. IDBP should also take advantages of new opportunities
in the money and capital markets. IDBP must develop instruments
which would give it a competitive advantage;



- 14 -
c)   Concerning its business diversification, IDBP should diversify
its products mix, start more profitable operations and become a
broad based financial institution in the framework of its present
charter. Merchant banking could be one option as the financial
sector evolved; and
d)   concerning its institutional upgrading, XDBP should continue to
strengthen its internal operations through computerization of
operations, and formal training of its staff. However, to
implement its resource and product diversification, IDBP would
need to employ the right people SF fairly senior levels. It may
be slow and ineffective to develop people from within through
training. Consequently, IDBP should use outside experts to
train its people and/or attract the right people for this kind
of work. The Bank provided a TA under IIC I and IIC II. IDBP
engaged external auditors to carry out a study to identify
profitable new areas of business, recommend organizational
changes to incorporate these possible new activities, and advise
and direct IDBP's initial efforts in these respects. The study
was completed last yeat, and implementation has started.
41.      IDBP could improve its operations and with determined efforts, should
be able to perform better. IDBP's strategy for the future is aimed at making
the transition from a traditional DFC to a broad based financial institution
and at further improving its profitability by (i) building up its working
capital loans to the level of about Rs 2.2 billion in FY90; and (ii)
maintaining its present liquidity position at an acceptable level. To achieve
the above, IDBP must (i) diversify its banking services; and (ii) collect more
than 75% of the amount falling due on all new loans (loans made from FY81
onward) and also achieve significant collection rates on pre-FY81 loans. IDBP
will have to pay much closer attention to recent new loans which are the direct
responsibility of the piesent management.
42.      The achievement of IDBP's objectives is not only sensitive to overall
economic development in Pakistan,-L but will also depend on its management
and organization systems and staff resources. This has been vital for IDBP.
Under IIC I and II, the Bank Group provided Technical Assistance funding for
IDBP to review its present organization and staffing structure. Under the
proposed IIC III, the Bank Group asked IDBP to implement its diversification
program and present a concrete business plan by mid-April 1988. The
institution came up with a comprehensive business plan with a time-bound action
plan and has taken some actions recently. IDBP recovery performance will also
be jointly reviewed by the Bank Group, ADB and GOP at the collection review
meeting scheduled in July 1988.
The general business prospects in Pakistan are likely to be good due to
the continued improvement in the investment climate and GOP's policy of
providing incentives to promote private industrial investment.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
43.      With the benefits of tne hindsights, the project objectives set out at
the time of the appraisal turned out to be too ambitious within the time frame
provided by the project. Because of its institutional weakness, IDBP was
unable to tackle its financial problems vigorously. Furthermore, its role in
the Pakistan financial system became less important with the emergence of the
commercial banks as the major provider of the full range banking services. The
difficulties experienced made it clear thit if IDBP is to remain a strong
financial institution car  Ae of playing a role in the financing of the private
industrial sector, it must adopt a different strategy in doing business, i.e.
to provide a broader range of banking services by taking full advantage of its
bankir.g license. In fact, IDBP made some progress in this respect during 1985-
1986. These actions were taken in connection with the subsequent loans under
which the Bank adopted a multi-institutional lending strategy. These loans
included specific technical assistance for institutional strengthening in the
whole financial sector as well as provisions for individual institution.
44.      Project implementation (disbursements) was achieved at a slower pace
than had been envisaged, namely due to delays in securing equity and complying
with government requirements and financial procedures. Overall, the project
contributed positively to the private industrial investment. It contributed
to the financing of projects in the private sector, helped implement the
Government's decentralization policy and finally, assisted IDBP in going
through a critical period. However, some subprojects have experienced
difficulties such as implementation delays, cost overruns, and lower than
expected operating results. About one-third are still under implementation.
The foreign consultant financed under the technical assistance component
joined IDBP in 1983 and made a positive contribution to IDBP's project
appraisal and sector work.
45.      The institutional objectives of assisting IDBP in the diversification
of its portfolio. adopting and implementing an arrears recovery pr3gram,
improving its staff resources, and consolidating its financial position were
only partly achieved. The GOP support for required institutional improvements
was obtained as had been agreed under Credit 1186-PAK and subsequent lending
operations. The diversification effort which started in 1984 and is now
included in IDBP's strategy statement has been delayed. From 1985 to 1986,
collection performance improved, but this has not been sufficient for the
institution's long term viability. IDBP needs to: (i) prevent deterioration
of its portfolio (para. 40) which means IDBP should only finance good financial
and economical projects; and (ii) have the in-house talent to implement
product and resource diversification, which means to employ the right people
at fairly senior levels (para 40). A study was carried out last year under
the TA component of IIC II with regards to organizational restructuring,
strategy, and new business development; and implementation has started. It is
expected that: (a) the organization and strategy study financed under IIC II,
and (b) specific actions to be implemented by IDBP under the proposed IIC III
loan, would make positive contx,butions in restructuring and transforming IDBP
from a DFI to a full broad based financial institution.
46.      Despite the shortcomings, IDBP should be able to successfully manage
its diversification and consolidate its financial position with the measures
being discussed under the proposed IIC III project.   With the proper policies,
IDBP could recover fully from its present weaknesses and develop into a



- 16 -
relatively efficient institution. Under the proposed IIC III, the Bank Group
has requested that IDBP start implementing its diversification program which
was agreed under the second IIC project. IDBP will increasingly have to face
competition from commercial banks and will have to define more precisely the
specific function that it will perform in the field of development finance.
Unless IDBP implements its diversification and mobilization programs and moves
from crisis management to strategic management and have clear operational
goals, IDBP may not remain one of the GOP's main instruments for assisting in
the financing of private industries.

Procurement Procedures
The following procedures were followed for the procurement of foreign
imported machinery:
(i)         Machinery costing above $400,000 were allowed to be purchased
through international tendering;
(ii)         Machinery costing above $200,000 but not exceeding $400,000
were allowed to be purchased through competitive quotations
from five different sources; and
(iii)         Machinery costing up to $200,000 were allowed to be purchased
through competitive quotations from three different sources.
In the case of the imported second-hand or reconditioned machinery,
IDBP ensured that: (i) the machinery was not based on an obsolete process and
was in good working condition; (ii) its future working life was long enough to
cover the loan period plus two years at the minimum; (iii) its cost was
subatantially low as compared to the cost of similar new machinery; and (iv)
the machinery is suitable for the project.  These facts were also confirmed
and verified through inspection/survey by surveyors of international repute.
