Executive Summary
This is the report of a study to produce an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) for the existing Community-Based Rural Development Project
(CBRDP) and the developing Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management
(SILEM) Program, [hereafter referred to as 'the Project']. The project corresponds with
the central features of the GoBF's strategy for poverty reduction which focuses on the
following key issues: accelerating broad-based equitable growth; increasing access of the
poor to basic social services; increasing the employment and income generating potential
of the poor; and promoting good governance.(1)
The objectives of the study are:
* To assess the potential environmental and social impacts of the CBRDP and SILEM
Program, whether positive or negative, and propose mitigation measures 7vhich will
effectively address these impacts;
* To inform the project preparation process committee charged with integrating SILEM
into CBRDP of the potential impact of different alternatives, and relevant mitigation
measures and strategies;
* To establish clear directives and methodologies for the environmental and social
screening of micro-projects to be financed both by CBRDP and SILEM.
Community Based Rural Development Project
The Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) receivedfinancingfrom the IDA, effective in
December 2001 to support its Communihy Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP),
which is a community-driven development program with local investmentfunds managed
by communities and targeted to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in
rural areas. The program aims to be implemented in Burkina Faso's 45 provinces over a
period of 15 years, in threefive-year phases. The program's objective is to support poverty
reduction and promote sustainable development in rural Burkina Faso through
strengthened local governance and community empowerment, with a focus on
marginalized groups. The CBRDP aims to be implemented within a decentralized rural
developmentframe7vork, and shall more specifically (a) support implementation of
demand-driven micro-projects, and (b) conduct local capacity-building efforts.
To achieve these goals, the program shall:
(i)    Strengthen capacihy of villages and local governments to prioritise, plan,
implement, and maintain communihy-based investnments;
(ii)   Provide decentralizedfundingfor demand-driven and communihy-managed rural
infrastructure and services; and
(iii) Support Burkina Faso's ongoing decentralization and PRSP processes.
Phase I of the CBRDP (2001-2005) will initiate tiw process, develop the capacity of rural
areas to manage their 07vn development in a sustainable, equitable and productive

manner, andfacilitate the emergence of rural municipalities or groups of municipalities.
To that effect, it will couple capacity building activities and a demand-driven local
investnientfund to enable communities to learn by doing. Phase 1 (2006-2010) will
build upon and expand the achtievements of Phase I and scale up the program to a national
level. Phase III (2010-2015) will consolidate whlat has been achieved and prepare an exit
strategy.
Tle baseline project (CBRDP) has thefolloWingfive components:
1) Build and reinforce local capacity building;
2) Provide local investmentfunds;
3) Build and reinforce institutional capacity building,
4) Introduce a land tenure securihy pilot project; and
5) Strengthen and provide program coordination and monitoring and evaluation
functions.
Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystemn Managetnent (SILEM)
The Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management (SILEM) project, funded through
the GEFfinancing window, is designed to provide supplemental support to the CBRDP.
SILEM will provide incremental supportfor environmental and natural resource
management related activities under each of thesefive components as listed above, in each
of the Program's three phases.
SILEM's basic development objective is to strengthen the capacity of rural communities to
undertake an integrated management of their ecosystems, so as to help reduce, mitigate
and reverse to some extent the degradation of their natural resource base, and thereby
alleviate, in a sustainable manner, poverhy and vulnerabilihy. In particular, SILEM will
generate multiple and interconnected environmental benefits such as:
(a) Building capacityfor sound, sustainable integrated ecosystem management
planning (IEM) and implementation at local, regional and national levels;
(b) Reduce, mitigate, and reverse land degradation and desertification with adequate
and innovative soil and water management technologies in lowlands as a means
for improving the productivihy and sustainability of plant and animal production
systems, andfor protecting natural habitats of local and global importance; and
(c) Strengthen the natural resource base and decrease vulnerability to climate change
(drought and other stressfactors) by improving conservation and maintaining
(agro-) biodiversihy at ecosystem, species and genetic level.
SILEM plans to intervene in itsfirst phase (2003-2006) in only 100 villages to initiate
and demonstrate IEM activities. In the second phase (2006-2010), CBRDP will intervene
in an additional 2,000 villages, with an ultimate goal to cover all 8,000 of Burkina Faso's
villages in the third phase, 7Vlile SILEM will intervene in an additional 200 villages in
the second phase, but no more than 600 villages by the end of the third phase. SILEM's
goal is to initiate, consolidate, and confirm IEM demonstration activitiesfor replication
throughout the countny to be initiated - andfunded - by communities themselves.



Both CBRDP and SILEM are administered, andfinances are channelled through, the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU), wvhich Works at the national, regional, provincial, and
community levels.
Majorfindings
The potential environmental and social impacts of CBRDP and SILEM      Will vany in
significance according to the size and strategic influence of sub-projects. At a strategic
level both CBRDP and SILEM have the potential to make a significant positive
contribution to environmental and social sustainability - and specifically natural resource
sustainabilihy - though there are risks of negative impacts associated with individual sub-
projects.
Ensuring that CBRDP/SILEM make significant positive contribution to environmental
and social sustainability will require the integration of understanding of communities'
management of tleir resources into the strategic direction of the project. 7This wvill be
addressed under the components outlined above and the application of this ESMF.
Guidance on impacts
Examples of potential Communihy -driven activities, and of larger 'inter-community'
activities, under the componentsfor both CBRDP and SILEM are given in below, with
indications of some of the potential negative and positive environmental and social
consequences associated 7with each.

Environmental and Social Management Framework
Tlhis report sets out the Environmental and Social Management Framework that will be
used to avoid, manage or mitigate all potential environmental and social impacts
associated zvith the sub-projects. The ESMF includes:
* Relevant Burkina Faso and World Bank Safeguard Procedures (Chapter 3);
* Guidance on potential impacts (Chapter 5);
* Reporting systems and responsibilities of officers in implementing the ESMF
(Chapter 6);
* Capacihy-building and training requirements (Chapter 7); and
*   Costs to be mainstreamed into project design (Chapter 8).
T1te details of the ESMF Will be integrated into the sub-project cycle.
Reporting systems
Elements of the ESMF include aflovchartfor reporting and advice, a screening checklist
for communihy micro-projects, a screening checklistfor inter-community projects
applicable to both CBRDP and SILEM, and support to local development components,
annual report forms for officers, and explicit descriptions of roles, accompanied by terns of
reference.
The screening checklistfor communihy micro-projects is based on a list of basic yes/no
answers, culminating in a decision on whtethterfurthter advice is sought, and if so from
whonm. The screening checklistfor inter-communihy projects also demands thatfurther
information is given on the reasoningfor the yes/no answers, and it culminates in a
decision on 7Vhetter afurther in-depth EIA is required.
Responsibilities
The main measures required to implenment the ESMF are:



*  At the national level, a staff member will be appointed within the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) With a specific responsibility for addressing natural
resources management issues;
*  An annual environmental performance audit, to be carried out by an independent
consultant;
*  The Natural Resources Management Officer Will stimulate the Provincial Technical
Coordination Committee (CCTPs) and Provincial Coordination Units (PRCUs) to
develop strategic approaches to environmental sustainability in their provinces;
*  Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers will be selectedfrom qualified PRCU
staff or recruited to ensure environmental and social issues are addressed and
mitigated at the communihy or inter-communihy level;
*  Specific studies would be carried out on issues of natural resources management and
cumulative assessments.
Training and sensitisation programs
Details of the project's training and sensitisation programs on environmental and social
management and mitigation are provided. Recommendations for training include
sensitisation and knowledge training in the areas of environmental and social screening
and natural resource managementfor targeted audiences (Village and Inter-village
Management Committees, Contract Service Providers Provincial Coordination Units,
Provincial Technical Coordination Committee, Project Coordination Unit).
Costs
Estimated costsfor mainstreaming environmental and social recommendations into the
project design are also provided. The overall costs under the ESMF are estimated at US$
1,370,000 over and indicative six-year project implementation period.

INTRODUCTION
The Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF) has requested support for the
preparation and financing of an Environmental and Social Management Frame7vork
(ESMF) for the existing Communihy-Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP) and
the developing Sahel Integrated Lo7Vland Ecosystem Management (SILEM) Program,
[hereafter referred to as 'the Project']. The project corresponds with the central
features of the GoBF's strategy for poverty reduction which focuses on the
following key issues: accelerating broad-based equitable growth; increasing
access of the poor to basic social services; increasing the employment and income
generating potential of the poor; and promoting good governance.(')
This is the report of a study to produce an environmental and social management
framework [hereafter referred to as the 'ESMF study'] for the proposed combined
CBRDP and SILEM Program.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the study are:
* To assess the potential environmental and social impacts of the CBRDP and
SILEM Program, whether positive or negative, and propose mitigation
measures which will effectively address these impacts;
* To inform the project preparation process committee charged with integrating
SILEM into CBRDP of the potential impact of different alternatives, and
relevant mitigation measures and strategies;
* To establish clear directives and methodologies for the environmental and
social screening of micro-projects to be financed both by CBRDP and SILEM.
The primary tasks of the study are:
* To develop an environmental and social management framework that
establishes methodologies for environmental and social impact assessment
within project implementation;
* Identify potential policy issues regarding the environment and propose means
of resolution that could be undertaken during project implementation;
* Develop a capacity building program for stakeholders to carry out
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for micro-projects and to design
potential mitigation measures in line with the World Bank's safeguard
requirements and environmental legal requirements of the GoBF.

Resources Management (ERM) to Burkina Faso from 16 March -- 4 April 2003. The
mission consisted of various field visits to four regions (provinces) selected by the
Project. (2) The authors of this report are listed in Annex 1. The itinerary of the
field visits for the ESMF study is given in Annex 2. Government organizations,
stakeholders, NGOs and other persons contacted during the entire mission are
given in Annex 3. The list of documents reviewed is given in Annex 4.
1.2          ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The study has been charged with the development of an Environmental and Social
Management Framewvork, as opposed to an Environmental Impact Assessment,
because the precise details of the micro-projects - in terms of exact location,
materials required, key communities, etc. - to be financed under the CBRDP and
SILEM are not yet known. This is the case for the community-driven
development component or local investment fund, but it is also true for micro-
projects within the support to local development and decentralization
component, and the land degradation and desertification component. These
components are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 under project description.
Therefore, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is
required, to screen for and manage the potential environmental and social
impacts of the CBRDP and SILEM, and to strategically assess and manage its
overall environmental and social impact.

2           DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
2.1         BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT
2.1.1       National Programfor Decentralized Rural Development
The Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) received financing from the IDA,
effective in December 2001 to support its Communiht Based Rural Development
Project (CBRDP), which is a community-driven development program with local
investment funds managed by communities and targeted to reduce poverty and
promote sustainable development in rural areas. The program aims to be
implemented in Burkina Faso's 45 provinces over a period of 15 years, in three
five-year phases. The program's objective is to support poverty reduction and
promote sustainable development in rural Burkina Faso through strengthened
local governance and community empowerment, with a focus on marginalized
groups. The CBRDP aims to be implemented within a decentralized rural
development framework, and shall more specifically (a) support implementation
of demand-driven micro-projects, and (b) conduct local capacity-building efforts.
The CBRDPs long-term vision is one of participatory and representative local
governments and institutions planning and managing their own development
programs, and mobilizing the necessary resources through increased local
revenues and government fiscal transfers. To achieve these goals, the program
shall:
(i)   Strengthen capacity of villages and local governments to prioritise, plan,
implement, and maintain community-based investments;
(ii)  Provide decentralized funding for demand-driven and community-
managed rural infrastructure and services; and
(iii)  Support Burkina Faso's ongoing decentralization and PRSP processes.
Phase I of the CBRDP (2001-2005) will initiate the process, develop the capacity of
rural areas to manage their own development in a sustainable, equitable and
productive manner, and facilitate the emergence of rural municipalities or groups
of municipalities. To that effect, it will couple capacity building activities and a
demand-driven local investment fund to enable communities to learn by doing.
Phase II (2006-2010) will build upon and expand the achievements of Phase I and
scale up the program to a national level. Phase III (2010-2015) will consolidate
what has been achieved and prepare an exit strategy.
The baseline project (CBRDP) has the following five components:
1) Build and reinforce local capacity building;

2) Provide local investment funds;
3) Build and reinforce institutional capacity building,
4) Introduce a land tenure security pilot project; and
5) Strengthen and provide program coordination and monitoring and evaluation
functions.
2.1.2          Project target areas
CBRDP is expected to intervene directly in 26 provinces during Phase I. These
interventions will be managed by 19 provincial project coordination units. Figure
2.1 shows both provinces where CBRDP/SILEM intends to intervene directly and
indirectly. It is expected that Phase II will involve direct intervention in all
provinces.

2.2          BACKGROUND TO AHEL INTEGRATED LOWLAND ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT (SILEM)
PROJECT
2.2.1        The Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management project
The Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management (SILEM) project, funded
through the GEF financing window, is designed to provide supplemental support
to the CBRDP. SILEM will provide incremental support for environmental and
natural resource management related activities under each of these five
components as listed above, in each of the Program's three phases.
SILEM's basic development objective is to strengthen the capacity of rural
communities to undertake an integrated management of their ecosystems, so as to
help reduce, mitigate and reverse to some extent the degradation of their natural
resource base, and thereby alleviate, in a sustainable manner, poverty and
vulnerability. In particular, SILEM will generate multiple and interconnected
environmental benefits such as:
(a) Building capacity for sound, sustainable integrated ecosystem
management planning (IEM) and implementation at local, regional and
national levels;
(b) Reduce, mitigate, and reverse land degradation and desertification with
adequate and innovative soil and water management technologies in
lowlands as a means for improving the productivity and sustainability of
plant and animal production systems, and for protecting natural habitats
of local and global importance; and
(c) Strengthen the natural resource base and decrease vulnerability to climate
change (drought and other stress factors) by improving conservation and
maintaining (agro-) biodiversity at ecosystem, species and genetic level.
2.2.2       Implementation
CBRDP/SILEM's (hereafter the Project) implementation follows the course that is
being adopted by the overall national community-driven development (CDD)
program of Burkina Faso, called the National Program for Decentralised Rural
Development, or PNDRD. The PNDRD aims to build capacity for and support
decentralisation throughout Burkina Faso's 8,000 villages by the year 2010. The
PNDRP will also support the ongoing participatory development process being
carried out under Burkina Faso's Poverty Reduction Strategy and Rural
Development Strategy (PRSP).(4)

In the first phase (2001-2006), CBRDP plans to intervene in 26 provinces with a
target of 2,000 villages. SILEM plans to intervene in its first phase (2003-2006) in
only 100 villages to initiate and demonstrate IEM activities.
In the second phase (2006-2010), CBRDP will intervene in an additional 2,000
villages, with an ultimate goal to cover all 8,000 of Burkina Faso's villages in the
third phase, while SILEM will intervene in an additional 200 villages in the
second phase, but no more than 600 villages by the end of the third phase.
SILEM's goal is to initiate, consolidate, and confirm IEM demonstration activities
for replication throughout the country to be initiated - and funded - by
communities themselves.
Both CBRDP and SILEM are admninistered, and finances are channelled through,
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which works at the national, regional,
provincial, and community levels. Table 2.2 illustrates the CBRDPs roles and
responsibilities at the national, regional, provincial, and village levels.

3           SAFEGUARD SCREENING PROCEDURES
The proposed Environnental and Social Management Framnework has been designed
to fully comply with national environmental codes and legislations in Burkina
Faso and with the World Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies.
This chapter sets out the key safeguard policies that provide the policy context to
the ESMF including World Bank policies and Burkina Faso's legal requirements
on environmental assessment. More details of the policy context are provided in
Annex 5.
3.1         WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES
As discussed in the previous chapter, the CBRDP will be supported by the GEF
financed SILEM which aims to provide support for environmental and natural
resource management related activities.
As part of the ESMF process, proposed micro-activities under the combined
CBRDP/SILEM will be designed at the local level to ensure that they are screened
for potential impacts and that they comply with the requirements set out under
World Bank safeguard policies.
The CBRDP/SILEM is anticipated to have mostly beneficial impacts on the
environment, as its main objectives is to promote sustainable land use and
ecologically sound natural resources management through community driven
development. However, due to the nature of the potential micro-projects to be
financed under the Local Investment Fund, which involves small-scale
infrastructure, the proposed project has been rated Category B under the World
Bank's policy on environmental assessment (OP 4.01), requiring a partial
environmental assessment (EA). The EA is required to assess the potential
impacts associated with micro-projects. In addition to the OP 4.01, the
CBRDP/SILEM has also triggered a number of other safeguard policies as
indicated in Table 3.1.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01)       Yes
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04)               Yes
Forestry (OP4.36, GP 4.36)                                 No
Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                  No
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03)                              No
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)                               No
Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12, BP 4.12)                 Yes
Safety of Dames (OP 4.37, BP 4.37)                         No
Projects in Intemational Waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP 7.50)  No
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)     No
This can be explained as follows:
OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment)
The OP 4.01 has been triggered because there is the potential that implementation
of the CBRDP/SILEM may lead to negative environmental impacts. The EA
study, however, has determined that there are no potential large-scale, significant
or irreversible environmental impacts associated with the project. The potential
impacts identified are mainly localized impacts associated with activities to be
financed under the local investment funds (i.e. rural roads, feeder roads through
forest zones, tracks and pathways in pastoral zones, small scale dams, piped
water systems, wetlands and ecosystem management, and rangeland
management), which can be effectively mitigated and are addressed in the ESMF
and using the screening and review procedures in Chapter 6. The ESMF identifies
the major potential environmental issues that could arise as a result of project
interventions and proposes measures to be taken to mitigate these effects,
including proposed training and monitoring measures.
OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats)
The OP 4.04 has been triggered due to the potential nature of CBDRP/SILEM
activities to border or operate in natural habitats or protected areas. Moreover, the
SILEM program aims to finance investments in the conservation of natural
habitats and biodiversity. Natural habitats have to be carefully protected since
Burkina Faso has a rich biodiversity and a number of protected areas designated
by law. The project areas under the project encompass a number of natural
habitats and/or may border or operate in these areas. Thus, the ESMF will
identify any potential impacts that activities to be financed under the project may
have on natural habitats, reserves or protected areas in Burkina Faso using the
screening tools proposed in Chapter 6.

OP 4.12 (Involuntany Resettlement)
The Project will support community investments in various types of micro-
projects, of which many, particularly those involving small-scale infrastructure,
will require land for construction. To mitigate against the potential for
involuntary resettlement, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been
prepared which provides the framework for resettlement planning under the
CBRDP. In addition, a Process Framework has been prepared specifically under
the SILEM project, to address the potential impacts related to resettlement and
migration associated with sensitive and natural habitats and protected areas. The
screening tools provided in Chapter 6 have been designed to address issues of
resettlement and land acquisition in parallel with the screening criteria developed
under the RPF.
3.1.1        Mainstreaming safeguard compliance into sub-project screening
The screening criteria provided in the ESMF includes relevant questions on
natural habitats/protected areas, involuntary resettlement and land acquisition,
introduction of pesticides, impacts to forestry resources, impacts to cultural
property and inclusion of indigenous people in the project identification process.
This will ensure that all concerns related to the Bank's safeguard policies are
taken into account during the screening of micro-projects for potential impacts,
and that the appropriate mitigation measures can be adopted to address them.
3.2          BURKINA FASO'S LEGISLATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The preparation of this ESMF has also taken into account the requirements for
environmental assessment under Burkina Faso's law, mainly under the Code de
l'Environnement, or Code of Environment Lazv. The GoBF passed this law in 1994
following the identification of the need to improve environmental assessment in
Burkina Faso's National Environmental Action Plan. The Code has appointed the
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Livelihoods (formerly called the Ministry of
Environment and Water) as the institution responsible for environmental
management, pollution control, and protection and conservation of natural
resources.
In parallel with the Code, a Decret No 2001-342 for EIA legislation was passed in
2001 by the Council of Ministers. The legislation outlines the application
procedures, categories of environmental classification for various types of projects
and program, and the requirements for approval and review of EIAs. Annex 5
provides detailed information on the environmental regulations and
administrative framework in Burkina Faso.

3.2.1        Sub-project screening under Burkina Faso law
With these requirements in mind, for those sub-projects which require an EIA, as
determined under the screening and review process (Chapter 6), a copy of the EIA
report will be submitted to the Minist"y of Environment and Sustainable Livelihoods
(MESL) for approval. The MESL will have 2 weeks to review and comment on the
EA before the sub-project can be appraised. This will ensure that sub-projects that
may have potentially significant impacts and require more detailed study receive
national level approval as well as district level approval.
3.2.2        MESL approval of this ESMF
The authors of this ESMF study propose that as long as the ministry has the
opportunity to approve the ESMF, they should not require EIAs of all sub-
projects or micro-projects.

4           BASELINE INFORMATION
This chapter provides with key baseline socio-economic information on the
CBRDP/SILEM's project sites. Detailed assessment of baseline features of
Burkina Faso relevant to the CBRDP/ SILEM is provided in Baseline Annex 6.
4.1         IDENTIFICATION OF PROJECT SITES
For the first phase (2002-2005), CBRDP will cover 2,000 villages in 26 provinces
throughout the country. SILEM program will support rehabilitation of degraded
lowland ecosystems for Burkina Faso's northern provinces of Soum, Oudalan,
Seno, Yatenga, Loroum and Bam (100 villages) located in the northern Sahelian
zone, covering 36, 829 sq km (13.4% of the country), and 662,129 inhabitants.
For the second, third and fourth phases (2006-2015), CBRDP aims to extend to all
45 provinces of Burkina Faso, whereas SILEMs intends to cover 600 lowland
villages and related micro-basin and watershed rural communities. SILEM's
main project implementation areas are the following:
* Northern Sahel sylvo-pastoral and wildlife reserve;
* The protected natural habitats on the central Mossi plateau; and
* The protected natural habitats in the Eastern, Southern and Western provinces.

* 45.3% of the population falls below the national poverty line (30 cents per day
per capita), and 85% of the population lives below the internationally
recognised income poverty line (two dollars per day). (8)
*  Life expectancy at birth is 44 years, and the illiteracy rate is at 75%. (9)
4.3          PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.3.1        Agro-climactic Zones
Burkina Faso can be divided into three major agro-ecological zones (refer to
Baseline Annex 6):
In the North is the Sahelian zone, with 350-500 mm rainfall per year. The
Sahelian zone is characterized by sand dunes interspersed with areas of tiger
bush and hardpan, and hills and low lying rocky ridges. There is a
predominance of steppe vegetation such as Acacia Senegal, Acacia nilotica,
Balanites aegyptica, Aristida spp, Cenchrus spp. The baobab (Adanosonia digitata)
is one of the most commonly found tall trees in the area.
* In the Centre is the Sudano-Sahelian zone (the central plateau, central-north,
central-east, and east), with 700-800 mm rainfall per year, with high variability
across small distances. The Sudano-Sahelian region is characterised by
savannah. The most common species of tall trees are Burhyrospermum parkii,
Klhaya senegalensis, Parkia biglobosa, Tamarindus Cymbopogon and Loudetia. The
most commonly found grasses are Andropogon gayanus, Cymbopogon and
Loudetia.
* In the West and South is the Sudanian zone, with 800-1,000 mm rainfall per
year. However, the Sahara desert is relentlessly moving south, and drying the
wooded savannah and its thin layer of cultivatable soil into sun-blackened
rock-hard lakenite. Here, the herbaceous layer is more dense and forms a
continuous covering.
4.3.2        Rivers and Plains
Three principal rivers run through the country: the Komoe (Comoe) River is in
the Southwest, which flows through Cote d' Ivoire to the Gulf of Guinea; in the
Centre are the Mouhon (Black Volta), Nazinon (Red Volta), and Nakambe (White
Volta) rivers, which join in Ghana to form the Volta; and in the Northeast are
several small tributaries of the Niger. High plains of about 1000 to 1300 feet
comprise the major part of the territory. The highest, Mount Tenakourou in the

west near the border with Mali, measures 2500 feet, followed by the peak of
Nahouri in the South.
4.3.3        Climate
The tropical weather in Burkina Faso is divided into two seasons: the dry season
from November to May (with a cool and dry period from November to February,
and hot weather from March to May), and the rainy season from June to October.
The average temperature is 600F (15oC) at night, and 85oF (300C) during the day,
except in the dry season when temperatures may rise to over iOoF (380C).
Annual rainfall is highly variable over space and time, and ranges from 40 inches
to 10 inches.
4.4         SocIo-ECONoMIc ENVIRONMENT
44.1        Population and land use
Burkina Faso's population is estimated at 11.6 million people, with a growth rate
of 3.2 per annum. About 55% of the entire population lives in rural areas and the
population distribution in Burkina Faso is uneven. The following is the
breakdown of population concentration according to three zones:
*  The Sahelian Zone in the North is a traditional herding area, with a low
population density (10-12 person per sq. km). The Sahelian people are
increasingly moving to the west, south and east, due to increasing
desertification in the region. In the Sahelian Zone, the Fulani system
combines traditional herding with mixed farming. Here, some
households live like the Bwa-Dagari, and others like the Mossi.
* The Sudano-Sahelian Zone in the Centre and East is the most densely
populated area (of around 40-50 person per sq.km). The Kadiogo
Province, in which the capital city Ouagadougou is located, has 156
inhabitants per sq mile, and has the largest population. Ouagadougou,
the capital city, counts some one million inhabitants. The second largest
province is Kouritenga province in the East, with 47.6 inhabitants per sq
mile. The Mossi system is prevalent in this zone, where households
occupy separate plots scattered across the territory. Under this system,
individuals within a household may cultivate different plots.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT               GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
17



*  In the West, in the Sudanian Zone, the Bwa-Dagari system exists, in which
households are grouped together and form a village concession consisting
mainly of village fields and bush. It is sparsely populated and attracts
people from the other two areas seeking better farming and living
conditions. This is a cotton-growing region of Burkina Faso, with the most
fertile soil in the country.
4.4.2        National Economy
GDP per capita was US $214 in 2001, and according to the Human Development
Index, Burkina Faso is among the ten least developed countries in the world (169
out of 175 countries). However, the country's economic performance has been
steadily improving in the past 10 years, with an average GDP growth rate of 5.6%.
Agriculture and livestock account for 32% of GDP, 92% percent of labour force
and 60% of exports. Industry accounts for 27.8% of GDP and 3% of labour force
and is largely based on agriculture. Service contributes to 40.2% of GDP and 5%
of labour force. The following are the main economic indicators:
*  About 87% of the population of Burkina Faso are engaged in subsistence
agriculture and nomadic stock-keeping. There are about 1,300,00 farms,
generally marked by low productivity;
*  A significant proportion of the male labour force migrates annually to the
neighbouring countries, particularly to Ghana and C'ote d'Ivoire, for
seasonal employment. Most workers are employed in the agriculture
sector. Main agricultural activities include growing peanuts, shea nuts,
cotton, millet, corn rice, sesame sorghum and tending livestock;
*  The main industries in Burkina Faso are cotton, lint, beverages,
agricultural processing, soap, cigarettes, textiles and gold;
*  Burkina Faso exports cotton, animal products and gold. The country
imports machinery, food products and petroleum.; and
* 220 million kWh (1996) of energy is produced in Burkina Faso using fossil
fuels and hydro-electric power. However, the greatest fuel source (96%)
comes from burning wood.
4.4.3        Socio-welfare indicators
According to Poverty Analysis in Burkina Faso, 1999 (10), the proportion of the
population living below the poverty line is 45.3% (11). The poverty is a rural
phenomenon, accounting for 94% of the national figure in 1998. There is a high

percentage of inequity in Burkina Faso: 10% of the total population continue to
account for 70% of aggregate national income, suggesting that there is not trickle
down effect of transferring wealth to the poor.
The poorest regions are the North, the North-Centre, the Northwest, the East-
Centre, the North-Centre, and the East. (Refer to Table 1.1 in Baseline Annex 6).
The incidence of poverty is highest among food crop farmers (50-52%), followed
by cash crop farmers (42.4%), and unemployed persons (38.7%). The average
household size among the poor is 7.6 persons. Analysis of the poverty trend by
socio-economic groups is provided in Table 1.2,Baseline Annex 6.
4.4.4         Education
One of CBRDP's major goals is to increase literacy through alphabetisation
program under its Local Capacihy Building component. Literacy is a first
prerequisite for successful capacity building and local development. Burkina
Faso has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world at 18.5% (1998).
Rural women have the lowest literacy rate at 6.8%. Rural literacy rate is poor
overall at 10.8%. Establishment of mobile schools and teaching centres seem to be
effective mechanisms for combating illiteracy in rural areas. Table 1.3 in Baseline
Annex 6 provides education indicators for 1998.
4.4.5         Health
CBRDP identified HIV/AIDS as the major health problem in the country, and
aims to address HIV/ AIDS problems through its Local Capacity Building and
Local Investment Funds (LIF) components by conducting HIV/AIDS training and
awareness increasing programs. The training will consist of providing
information on prevention, care and the identification of specific interventions
related to alleviation and prevention of the disease through local development
plans. (12)
Burkina Faso's population is growing at a rapid rate of 3.2% per annum, due to
the high fertility rate (6.8 births per woman). The health indicators are among the
poorest in Sub-Saharan Africa: life expectancy at birth is 54 years (as compared to
average of 52 for Africa), child mortality (13) is 219 (compared to 151), HIV
(12) Since the financial envelope is at US$ 3-5 per head for LIF, serious HIV/AIDS alleviaition and treatment can not be achieved
through CBRDP.

prevalence is 7% (African average at 8%), child malnutrition is at 32% (African
average at 24%), and maternal mortality is 484 per 100,000 live births.
Burkina Faso has the second highest HIV incidence among Western African
countries. Refer to Table 1.4. and Table 1.5 in Baseline Annex 6. HIV, malaria,
tuberculosis, cholera, hepatitis A, meningitis, typhoid fever, yellow fever,
schistosomiasis and dengue are major diseases that contribute to mortality in
Burkina Faso.
4.4.6        Migration
Many Burkinabe are migrating within country from one region to another, or
from rural to urban areas. Also, there has been migration to other countries such
as C6te d'Ivoire and Ghana. However, in the last two years the trend has
reversed, and due to recent instability in Western Africa, migrants have been
returning to Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso has a very high percentage of migrant
child labour, either to urban areas or to other countries. An estimated 9.5%
(333,000) of children 9-17 years live outside their homes, of which 29% (73,000)
lived abroad, mostly in Cote d'Ivoire. Box 1.1 in Baseline Annex 6 outlines the
trends of migration in the country.
4.4.7        Administration in Burkina Faso
Burkina Faso is governed under the Constitution of 1991. The president whom is
elected by popular vote for up to seven years heads the executive branch. The
bicameral legislature consists of a 111-member elected national assembly and a
120-member appointed chamber of representatives. The country is divided into
45 provinces. (For more information, please refer to Table 1.6. in Baseline Annex 6).
4.4.8        Ethnic Groups and Religions
Of the 60 ethnic groups that populate the country, the Mossi (48.6%), Bissa,
Gourounsi and Gourmantche live in the central territories of the Sudano-Sahelian
zone; the Fulani (7.8%) in the northern and northeastern territories of the Sahelian
zone; the Dioula in the west, in the Sudanian zone. Though traditional religions
are practiced by 25.9% of the population, two other religious faiths are
represented in Burkina Faso: Islam represents 52% and Christianity 17.6%. Refer
to Table 1.7. in Baseline Annex6.

4.5         ACCESS To ASSETS
4.5.1        Access to Land
Burkina Faso's land tenure system is largely governed by traditional systems, in
which the local chiefs make decisions regarding plot distribution among village
residents and incoming migrants. In Burkina Faso, women do not have right to
own land, but have the right to plant seeds of their choice on plots allocated to
them by husbands, or males in the family. Their rights to cultivate plots increases
with their status, and usually, the elder women (or the first wives) have much
more weight in the decision-making process regarding plot tending. Allocation
of separate plots to women helps households to diversify their risks, and to
ensure provision of subsistence crops.
4.5.2        Access to Productive Capital, Employment and Financial Services
Rural people have the lowest access to capital and financial services. The
economy of the poor remains largely non-liquid due to the absence of banks
geared to their needs and the scant presence of micro-credit organizations.
4.5.3       Access to Potable Water
In 1998, 90% of households obtained their drinking water from wells, borehole
and public taps. There is a trend to an improvement in the quality of drinking
water, due to the national water supply policy. However, waterborne diseases
are prevalent in rural areas and contribute to the high mortality and morbidity
rates.
4.5.4       Access to Electricity
In rural Burkina Faso, less than one percent of households have access to
electricity. In the cities, 63% of households use kerosene lamps, and 37% has
access to electricity. Approximately 96% of household fuel comes from burning
wood.
4.6          LINKAGES BETWEEN LIVELIHOODS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
There are several key linkages between livelihoods and environmental resources,
which are relevant to rural areas in Burkina Faso. These are outlined below.

21



4.6.1         Exploitation of local vegetation
Wood harvesting
Wood is used for two main purposes: as a source of energy and as a building
material. Wood represented 96% of the domestic energy consumed in 1993 The
annual loss of wooded surfaces in Burkina Faso between 1980 and 1990 was,
according to the World Bank, 80.000 to 100.000 ha.
Bushlfires
Fire is used for the following in Burkina Faso: (i) clearing the fields; (ii) hunting;
(iii) improving visibility; (iv) accelerating the re-growth of perennial grasses; and
(v) customary rituals. Fire impoverishes the soil and reduces its productivity,
due to causing the loss of certain nutrients (nitrogen, sulphur), and organic
matter. More than 75% of fires occur between October and December. (14)
Unsustainable herding practices
Pastoralism in Burkina Faso is based on the intensive exploitation of natural
resources (grazing lands) without the use of agricultural and industrial by-
products. Herders cut brunches from the trees and bushes to feed their animals
during the dry seasons. Unsustainable practices of pastoralism contribute to
severe degradation of grazing land in the Centre, East and North. Also, herders
who settle on the edge of natural reserves (in the North) pose a great threat to the
forests and the preservation of their biodiversity. (15)
Unsustainablefarming practices
Unsustainable farming in Burkina Faso contributes to soil degradation and
devegetation. In the cotton-producing regions of the west, overuse of fertilizers
and pesticides increasingly contribute to the loss of native vegetation. Also,
introduction of foreign species through farming contributes to the loss of
biodiversity.
4.6.2         Soil Erosion
Soil erosion due to water erosion can reach an average of 10 ha/year in the
Sahelian region. The short, heavy rains and the subsequent runoff are major
causes of soil erosion. As a result, the soil become sandy, and its water retention
capacity in decreased due to the loss of organic matter.
(14) Soil and Water Conservation in Burkina Faso, ODI, 1998
(15) Ibid, p.13
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                     GOVERNMENT OF BURKiNA FASO
22



In the Sudanian-Sahelian region, soil is liable to crust formation, which produces
run-offs during heavy rainstorms. Run-off water washes away nutrients from the
soil.
In Sudanian area, the Sahara desert is expanding into the region, and drying the
wooded savannah and its thin layer of cultivatable soil into sun-blackened rock-
hard lakenite.
4.6.3         Drought and Desertification
Drought is one of major causes of desertification. Since the 1960-70s, there has
been a persistent decline in average rainfall from 450 mm to 300 mm in the
North, and from 1,100 mm to 860 mm in the South.
There is growing evidence that changes in surface albedo and reduced
evapotranspiration (associated with devegetation) are instrumental in reducing
precipitation in areas. Devegetation has also resulted in reduced ground-water
recharge, increased soil-erosion and reduced soil fertility.
In the Sudano-Sahelian zone, there are 'cemeteries' of dead woodlands, with the
Sahelian species such as Acacia Senegal and Pterocarpu lucen colonizing the region.
Due to droughts, farmers have increasingly begun cultivating marginal areas and
muddy soils susceptible to erosion.

5           GUIDANCE ON POTENTIAL IMPACTS
This chapter presents guidance on the environmental and social impacts of
CBRDP/SILEM, and potential impacts of the proposed SILEM program. It is
designed to provide a set of procedures for those program officers charged with
the implementation of the ESMF as set out in Chapter 6.
We discuss both the positive impacts and the negative impacts of both programs.
We begin with conclusions on the overall impacts of both the Project (CBRDP and
SILEM) and SILEM on its own. Specific impacts are described in more detail for
community micro-projects to be funded by the Project and activities to be
supported by SILEM.
5.1         OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT
Environmental and social sustainability are fundamental to sustainable rural
development strategies, natural resource conservation, and poverty alleviation.
Lessons from past experiences in Africa and elsewhere demonstrate that
community involvement in the decision-making and management process may
bring effective and lasting improvement in the livelihoods of people, and can lead
to better use and protection of the natural resource base. Therefore
environmental and social sustainability are fundamental to the success of both
CBRDPand SILEM. However, there is a precarious balance between two very
different scenarios:
* On the one hand, under a scenario of a successful CBRDP and SILEM which
works in accordance with the vision and approach set out in project
documents, both the CBRDP and SILEM would make a significant positive
contribution to environmental and social sustainability in rural areas by
providing the tools and training to support community driven development
in the case of CBRDP/SILEM, and to make significant contributions to the
restoration and protection of the local and global environment in the case of
SILEM;
* On the other hand, under a scenario of a failing CBRDP/SILEM, activities
supported and funded would contribute to marked further decline in
environmental and social sustainability in these same areas, by not providing
adequate support and guidance for community development, and perhaps to
acerbate or accelerate degradation of the local and global environment.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT              GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FAso
25



Preliminary discussions with various stakeholders indicate that they are fully
appreciative of this observation. Indeed, the institutional, social, environmental
and other analyses carried out for CBRDP/SILEM or are currently being carried
out during project preparation for the SILEM program will lay the foundation for
the first, successful, scenario.
This conclusion emphasizes the importtance of the Environmental and Social
Management Framewvork, set out in Chlapter 6, to ensure that environmental and
social sustainability is fully mainstreamed into CBRDP/SILEM design, appraisal,
and implementation.
5.2         POTENTIAL POSMVE IMPACTS
The overall positive environmental and social impacts predicted under the first
scenario is based on the following reasoning for CBRDP/SILEM:
* The CBRDP/SILEM will strengthen traditional systems of environmental and
social governance and embrace the notion of community dialogue through
effective functioning of Village or Inter-Village Committees for Community
Land Management (CVGT/CIVGT);
* CBRDP/SILEM will help promote the decentralization process in rural
provinces through its capacity building component (CVGT/CIVGT,
CNCPDR);
* Various Project support activities to increase literacy and reduce poverty will
help communities to become better informed on impacts of degradation of
natural resources and encourage conservation;
* Strategically placed infrastructure development and associated services may
enable more sustainable production systems (e.g. agriculture, forestry, etc.);
* Maintenance and rehabilitation of rural roads will increase access to markets
and social services, such as health care and education;
* An increased number of strategically located small-scale water points will
help meet the need for potable water and lead to a more diffuse distribution
of human and livestock pressures on existing limited resources;
* Effective management and reversal of degradation of natural habitats through
a variety of known soil and water conservation techniques (e.g. rock bunds,
composting, windbreaks, reforestation, etc.) will lead to a positive impact on
conservation of natural habitats and biodiversity in most areas;
* Local institutional strengthening and empowerment is achieved through
improved understanding and use of the tools and mechanisms for
environmental and social impact assessment and participatory approaches to
community development (e.g. development of a community development
plan); and,

* Investment in social and economic infrastructure, such as construction or
rehabilitation of school classrooms, health clinics, markets, etc. will result in
improvement in people's well-being and livelihoods, and promote equitable
rural development.
Therefore CBRDP/SILEM has the potential to make a significant contribution to
GoBF's policies to protect and preserve the environment while reducing poverty
in rural areas.
For the proposed SILEM program presently under preparation, the overall
environmental and social impacts are more difficult to predict at this time. This
program is designed to be multi-focal, covering land degradation, biodiversity
conservation, climate change and international waters. Within this context, it
should be noted that many of these expected impacts would be very challenging
to monitor and evaluate. However, it is expected that there will a number of
positive impacts. These are illustrated in Box 5.1.
The rationale for providing supplemental funding to the CBRDP/SILEM is that
communities are more likely to express demands for social and income-
generating activities rather than for local and global and environment protection
activities. The SILEM investment window is intended to provide resources for
select communities to engage in environment protection activities and thereby
provide them with a greater incentive for them to express such demands for local
and global environment related activities.
SILEM will be "fully blended" into CBRDP/SILEM to support its five
components: (1) local capacity building, (2) local investment fund, (3) institutional
capacity building, (4) land tenure security, and (5) program coordination.
However, the disadvantage is that these opportunities and funds will not be
available to all CBRDP/SILEM participants and will be targeted primarily to
villages located in or around lowlands, micro-basins and watersheds and
protected habitats of Northem Sahel and Mossi plateau, as well as in the Eastern,
Southern and Western provinces of the country.

Box 5.1       Potential Positive Impacts of the CBRDP/SILEM
* Reduction in land degradation and desertification mitigation benefits expected to
arise from improvement in soil and water management/ conservation practices
and infrastructure;
* Promotion of benefits from an increased agro-biodiversity (biological
diversification of crops and livestock varieties/ecotypes) with increased adoption
and cultivation of certain crop varieties in lowlands after introduction and
implementation of improved lowland soil and water management infrastructure
and practices;
* Increased lowland soil micro-biological activity and micro-biodiversity through
improved soil-water management, improved drainage, soil de-compaction, and
improved management of organic manures to fertilize the soil;
* Promotion of small-scale aquaculture techniques in lowlands, combinations of
cropping and fishing/ aquaculture activities to enhance flooded surfaces in
lowlands where biodiversity is significant;
* Removal of threats and barriers to integrated ecosystem management and in
particular to conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in natural
habitats such as lowland gallery forests, sacred forests, and reserves of medicinal
plants, of various types of woods, birds, small animals, microorganisms and grass
vegetation;
* Carbon sequestration benefits from above and below the ground through
increased storage capacity in gallery and sacred forests, crop intensification and
resulting biomass, and an increase in organic matter content of soils;
* Protection of international waters (e.g. Volta and Comoe rivers) and their
tributaries through restoration of degraded river banks (from erosion and field
encroachment) which is expected to significantly reduce the pollution of
international waters of soil sedimentation and agro-chemicals;
* Contribution to the decentralization process through community management of
natural resources and Integrated Environmental Management (IEM) decision-
making processes;
* Provision of GIS tools to local communities and local governments for IEM land
use planning and the related training of individuals and institutions in their use;
* Formation of partnerships with international, public and private development
communities to acquire sustainable IEM financing capacity through various
financial schemes; and
* Improved land tenure security and access to agricultural inputs, particularly land
restoration inputs in combination with CBRDP/SILEM activities.
5.3           POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS
The overall negative environmental and social impacts predicted under the
second scenario for the Project is based on the following reasoning:
* Rural livelihoods and environments are often complex, unpredictable and
fragile (e.g. rural communities in Burkina Faso are highly stratified and

achieving effective participation by marginalized groups, including women,
youth, and migrants, may not be easy);
* Lack of adequate capacity for environmental and social screening of small
scale activities may exacerbate existing environmental and social issues
affecting communities within the target areas;
* Differential impacts of CBRDP/SILEM training and investments (according to
gender, wealth status, or livelihood strategy) may result in some groups
relying to a greater extent than others on unsustainable use of natural
resources;
* Alternative livelihoods and intensification of agricultural production
(including livestock), which may result in improved well-being, may also lead
to an increase in areas brought under cultivation and overall numbers of
livestock or tropical livestock and farming units, which may increase demand
on natural resources or degrade the surrounding environment;
* Introduced systems of governance (CVGT/CIVGT/CCTP) versus traditional
systems may create conflict, or contradictions may result in unsustainable
agricultural or natural resource management practices;
* Even where systems of governance are strong, incentives for effective
community management of natural resources in a sustainable manner may be
weak in comparison to incentives for unsustainable use;
* Rapid institutional change in the formal national, provincial and community
systems for governing natural resource areas and land management may
create competing institutions within government and decrease overall
effectiveness, especially in budget allocation and management;
* There are a significant number of NGO and development agency-financed
projects throughout Burkina Faso, with considerable rural development
experience, that may be undermined by the financial and political weight of
the Project if they are not effectively included in the process; and
* Rising population pressures, a deteriorating resource base, desertification and
drought due to climate change and extensification /intensification of the
agricultural production systems often lead to an increase in land-related
conflicts. The introduction of investments in these areas may attract outside
immigrants that will further increase pressure on existing resources and
possibly increase land-related conflicts.
However, both the Government of Burkina Faso and the World Bank have
considered these risks carefully in the preparation and design of the
CBRDP/SILEM, especially considering the experience gained through the
implementation of the earlier pilot PNGT1.

Table 5.1 sets out the factors contributing to these risks for CBRDP/SILEM, as
observed by the study team, and the features of the project design that could
mitigate these risks. Table 5.2 describes many of the proposed investment
activities that can be undertaken by CRBDP and predicts many of both positive
and negative impacts. This sub-project list and potential impacts is not intended
to be exhaustive as the sub-projects are expected to selected and developed using
a demand-based approach at the village level, with the exclusion of those
activities included on the negative list of the CBRDP/SILEM implementation
manual. Table 5.3 provides a list of these negative projects.

Under the proposed SILEM program, the overall environmental and social
impacts are more difficult to predict. However, the program designers have
identified a number of risks that may be encountered during implementation, and
these risks are presented in the PAD. Some of the overall negative environmental
and social impacts may include:
* Underestimation of progress made toward achieving political and
administrative decentralization and subsequent ineffective devolution of the
responsibility for IEM to local governments and communities to achieve
sustainability;
* Acceleration in land degradation and desertification due to increased pressure
on land resources despite improvements in soil and water
management/conservation practices and infrastructure;
* Decrease in agro-biodiversity (biological diversification of crops and livestock
varieties/ecotypes) due to unwillingness to adopt and cultivate certain crop
varieties in lowlands after introduction and implementation of improved
lowland soil and water management infrastructure and practices (e.g. farmers
favoring a mono-culture such as rice);
* Increased pressure to develop lowland areas without adequate investment in
necessary water control infrastructure, both upstream and downstream to
protect and control against destructive and erosive peak water flows (e.g.
resulting in soil erosion, sedimentation, and damage to structure and crops);
* Increased pressure on upland area surrounding developed lowlands resulting
in land degradation, deforestation, livestock pressures, etc.;
* Increased and unsustainable use of biological diversity in natural habitats
such as lowland gallery forests, sacred forests, and reserves of medicinal

plants, of various types of woods, birds, small animals, microorganisms and
grass vegetation despite investments made to encourage the contrary (e.g.
encroachment by non-stakeholders);
* Insignificant measurable positive impact on the protection of international
waters (e.g. Volta and Comoe rivers) and their tributaries through limited
restoration of degraded river banks (from erosion and field encroachment) or
insignificant reduction in the pollution of international waters from
controlling soil sedimentation and use of agro-chemicals;
* Inability to adapt GIS tools to the level of local communities and local
governments for IEM land use planning;
* Lack of progress toward establishing land tenure security and access to
agricultural inputs, particularly land restoration inputs in combination with
CBRDP/SILEM activities.

environmental and social risks possible under the Program, along with an

5.4         LOCALISED NEGATIVE IMPACTS
Most of the developments or micro-projects planned under the local investment
fund component of CBRDP/SILEM will be small in scale: therefore the
significance of the direct negative environmental and social impacts is likely to be
small. This is especially the case in comparison to larger-scale developments
elsewhere in Burkina Faso, for instance large-scale roads or large-scale dams.
Table 6.2 sets out the predicted impacts of the likely micro-projects to be financed
by the local investment fund.
Activities planned under the SILEM program could have significant
environmental impacts, especially when considering integrated ecosystem
management in selected lowland sites (100 such sites are expected to be
developed in during the first phase of the program). Experience in lowland
development has shown that unless lowland sites are carefully selected and any
required infrastructure and improvements and necessary protection measures are
well designed and constructed, this can lead to serious upstream and
downstream impacts. Also, developing these lowlands can create additional
population and livestock pressures on the lowland itself and the surrounding
environment. Intensification of agricultural activities (though development and
introduction of agro-biodiversity) can result in decreasing existing bio-diversity
and create access problems for wildlife.
5.5          CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
Many CBRDP/SILEM micro-projects are planned which may in some areas may
result in cumulative impacts on natural resources. Cumulative impacts are
impacts which may result from individually small-scale activities with minimal
impacts but which over time can combine to have a significant impact.
Examples are:
* Deforestation due to the exploitation of forest resources for such uses as
firewood, construction materials, etc.;
* Development of lowlands which may have both upstream and downstream
impacts (e.g., increase in soil erosion, decrease in available water resources
downstream resulting in less water flowing into international waterways);
* Bush clearing (using slash and burn methods) of marginal forest or bush land
with subsequent depletion of soil fertility;
* Potential impacts on groundwater, owing to the construction of numerous
wells and to the introduction of numerous small-scale irrigation works and
potential cumulative impacts on water users (especially downstream users of
potential river and streams);
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
45



*  Resettlement, displacement or loss of access to assets due to the acquisition of
land for the construction of schools, health centers, storage warehouses, cereal
banks, wells, etc.;
* Illegal poaching of wildlife due to expansion of land under cultivation,
illegally starting bush fires or increased proximity and access to protected
areas through construction of rural feeder and forest roads.
*  Attraction of large migrant populations to communities that have successfully
introduced improve social infrastructure (such as schools, health centers or
water sources) resulting in pressures that lead to overcrowding, depletion or
constraint of resources (e.g., space, supplies, water, etc.)
Cumulative impacts can also be defined as impacts which potentially develop
from the combined impacts of more than one project or large scale program
occurring with the same area of influence and time span. In such cases,
cumulative impacts will have to be assessed based on the combined affects of
potential impacts from the various program inputs. Considering the cumulative
impacts of the CBRDP/SILEM programs, stakeholders will be provided with an
opportunity to learn how to avoid or mitigate localized impacts from initial sub-
projects, so that measures can be integrated into subsequent activities. Chapter 6
provides a list of triggers which can be used to determine whether the programs
may result in cumulative impacts, and if so, what tools are required for
mitigation.
5.6          STRATEGIC IMPACTS
The location of certain small-scale activities such as feeder roads, water reservoirs
and development of irrigated agricultural activities downstream from small dams
might also have strategic impacts, which requires a more detailed assessment in
relation to the types of sector policies and land management plans that the GoBF
is advocating (e.g., how feeder roads may fit into the overall transport sector
policy in Burkina Faso). , Infrastructure such as feeder roads requires an
assessment of the location and design to take into account the potential impacts
that the road may have on the natural resources (soil erosion, encroachment on
protected areas, changes to surface run-off, dust, etc.) and on the social
environment (mobility of communities, migration of people, introduction of
diseases, etc.).
With respect to the SILEM program, the stated objective is to focus resources on
achieving significant local, national, regional and global environmental objectives.
The program intends to concentrate on the development of lowlands but it is
unclear whether investments will tend toward the protection of existing lowlands
for conservation purposes (e.g., biodiversity, wildlife, etc.) or toward
development for agricultural and other purposes (e.g., agro-biodiversity, control
structures, cultivation, etc.). The two directions are not necessarily exclusive, if
SILEM succeeds in effectively promoting integrated ecosystem management, then
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                   GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
46



environmental objectives and the goal to promote sustainable development and
reduce poverty can be attained.
Other strategic issues which need to be addressed under the Project are the issue
of land degradation, pollution, medical and domestic waste disposal, pest
management and sensitivity to vulnerable groups. These are discussed below.
5.6.1       Impact on ecological resources and land degradation
Many of the proposed activities and sub-projects can lead to both localized and
cumulative impacts on such areas as bio-diversity, lowlands, forests, soil and
water quality, etc. Land degradation due to sub-projects that involve
construction, deforestation, and induced impacts associated with small-scale
feeder roads, or any development that induces concentration of people,
agriculture or livestock in particular areas. The environmental and social
screening tools provided in Chapter 6 will be used to identify and mitigate the
potential impacts discussed as they related to certain types of community
investments.
5.6.2        Potential sources of pollution
With respect to CBRDP/SILEM micro-project investments, there is a possibility
that development of social and economic infrastructure can lead to pollution of
watercourses from increased generation of solid waste and wastewater due to
inadequate attention being paid to inclusion of proper sanitation facilities or
measures.
Regarding the SILEM program, the promotion of the use of agro-minerals and
organic manure can lead to pollution concerns, especially due to surface runoff
into adjacent water sources, including infiltration into ground water. This will be
carefully monitored via the annual reporting tools provided in Chapter 6 and
training will provided to communities in the proper handling and application of
these materials as part of the Local Capacity Building component.
5.6.3       Medical waste disposal
CBRDP/SILEM activities could generate small amounts of packaging associated
with pharmaceuticals, drugs or medical waste of any kind and this carries
disposal risks. Indiscriminate disposal carried risks for human and animal health,
pollution of watercourses, and land or water resource contamination in localized
areas.
Waste categorized as infectious or bio-hazardous is capable of spreading
infectious disease, and has become a very significant issue especially for
HIV/AIDS- contaminated materials. It is especially important to develop and
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
47



apply effective medical waste handling and disposal methods, with the support
of the appropriate line agencies or ministries (i.e. Ministry of Public Health for
humans, Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries for animals).
Because CBRDP/SILEM support will be for micro-projects both for humans and
animals, it is proposed that an appropriate mini-medical waste plan be developed
for facilities or activities generating such wastes and put in place before full
operation can begin.
A typical mini- medical waste disposal plan would need to consider handling and
disposal of waste products as illustrated in Box 5.2.
Box 5.2      Issues to be Addressed in a Mini-Waste Managemnent Plan
* Laboratory wastes - specimen or microbiologic cultures, stocks of infectious
agents, live and attenuated vaccines, and culture mediums;
* Blood or body fluids - liquid blood elements or other regulated body fluids, or
articles contaminated with blood or body fluids;
* Sharps -items such as syringes, needles, blades, broken glass;
* Contaminated animals - animal carcasses, body parts, bedding materials;
* Surgical specimens - human or animal parts or tissues removed surgically or by
autopsy;
* Isolation waste - waste contaminated with excretion, exudate, or secretions from
humans or animals who are isolated due to the highly communicable diseases
such as: Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Tick-borne encephalitis virus
complex (Absettarov, Hanzalo, Hypr, Kumlinge, Kyasanur Forest disease,
Marburg disease, Ebola, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus and Machupo virus.
5.6.4         Pest Managemnent and Chemical Use
Small-scale agricultural projects may involve strengthening existing practices,
introducing, diversifying or the intensification of crop production.
Support for the development of small-scale agriculture or certain livestock
activities (e.g. tick dips) may lead to the introduction or increased use of
pesticides and other agricultural chemicals such as herbicides and fertilizers to
promote crop growth. Pests are organisms that compete with humans, domestic
animals, or crops for nutritional resources. They include species of insects, mites,
nematodes, mollusks, plant pathogens, vertebrates and weeds.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                     GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
48



It is critical that appropriate planning, design and management be adopted for
the handling, use and management of all agricultural chemicals to avoid potential
negative environmental impacts. The project will support the development of
smaller-scale projects therefore it is anticipated that mini-pest (or chemical)
management plans will satisfy local needs. This plan should address the
following issues listed in Box 5.3.
Box 5.3       Issues to be addressed in a Mini-Pest Management Plan
* Proper use of agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers to avoid reduction in soil and
groundwater quality;
* Prevent fertilizer runoff into surface water sources to avoid negative impact on aquatic
environments;
* Proper use of pesticides and herbicides to avoid contamination of crops, soils and water.
* Proper use, handling and storage of all agricultural chemicals to avoid adverse health
impacts on rural population;
* Methods to ensure that banned or unauthorized agricultural chemicals are not used;
* Proper handling and disposal of unused agricultural chemicals and packaging materials
(e.g. sacks, plastic containers, etc.).
5.6.5         Impact on vulnerable groups
All activities planned by both CBRDP/SILEM and SILEM may not bring the
intended benefits to certain vulnerable groups and to the poor, and may further
contribute to inequitable distribution of resources and marginalizing of these
groups. The development of a local development plan (PGT) seeks to avoid this,
however the consistency of active participation by vulnerable groups may vary,
and cannot be ensured. Further, the levels to which CVGT/CIVGTs are induced
to select development priorities by external forces, and the ability of vulnerable
groups and the poorer segments of the population to express their views and
needs, cannot be stated at this time.
Thus, when planning activities and sub-projects, while it is crucial for
communities to receive support from skilled facilitators and specialists in
methods of community participation, project planning and management. It is
equally important that follow up be made (possibly by the CBRDP/SILEM
provincial teams) in order ensure that the concerns of the poor and vulnerable
groups have been taken into consideration over time.

Box 6.1       Proposed Actions for Implementation of Environmental and Social Mainstreaming
* At the national level, a staff member will be appointed within CBRDP/SILEM
PCU with a specific responsibility for addressing environmental and social issues,
in line with the World Bank's safeguard policies. The ESMF study team suggest
that the title of 'Natural Resources Management (NRM) Officer' be used by the PCU;
* At the provincial level, at least one full-time officer (possibly two) in each PRCU
will be appointed to provide technical backstopping on all aspects of
environmental and social mitigation. The title for these officers used below is
'Environmental and Social Mitigationi Officers';
*  These Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers will also be trained in the
Project's Resettlement Policy Framework in order to support the CVGTs and
CIVGTs to identify and promote sustainable practices for land management, land
tenure, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement; and conflict resolution.
* An annual environmental and social performance audit, to be carried out by an
independent consultant;
*  The Natural Resources Management Officer will stimulate CVGTs and CIVGTs to
develop strategic approaches to environmental sustainability in their
communities/inter-village committees.
* At more practical levels, specific studies would be carried out on issues of
environmental and social management assessment, and the details of the ESMF
set out in this chapter will be integrated into the sub-project cycle.

6.3          SCREENING FOR COMMUNITY MICRO-PROJECTS
Figure 6.2 sets out a simple process that Provincial Coordination Units (PRCUs)
and Contract Service Providers (CSPs) will apply in working with communities to
avoid and mitigate environmental impacts of community micro-projects.

Mitigation officers provide
advice to comnmunihj on
mitigation
Following identification of micro-projects by communities with the assistance of
the PRCU and CSP, the proposed micro-project is checked against a simple
screening checklist (Format 6.1). PRCU/CSP should encourage communities to
carry out this task themselves, possibly by the community animal health workers,
teachers or other literate members of the community. The checklist is a simple
yes/no checklist, culminating in whether specific advice to the community on
environmental mitigation is required. This decision is based on likely impacts,
and the level of experience in managing micro-projects within the community.
CSPs will give this advice, or in cases, will call upon PRCU Environmental and
Social Mitigation officers for specific technical advice. Screening forms will be
reviewed quarterly at CCTP meetings.
The screening checklist set out in Format 6.1 is based on a list of basic yes/no
answers, culminating in a decision on whether further advice is sought, and if so
from whom. There are several aspects to the rationale for the design of this
checklist:
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                   GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
56



Box 6.1      Rationalefor Design of the Screening Checklist
* There will be thousands of micro-projects financed by CBRDP/SILEM, while
there is only one or two Environmental and Social Mitigation Officer in each
PRCU. Therefore a system that is streamlined is required, and far as is
feasible, communities must be responsible for completion of screening;
* In most cases, communities will have very little knowledge of environmental
and social screening, hence, for the first two years of the program, PRCUs and
CSPs will be required to assist communities in using the screening forms;
* The screening prompts a list of yes/no answers in relation to questions on the
location of the project and the anticipated impacts; if there are 'yes' answers to
any of these questions, then the CSPs/ community are obliged to recommend
a course of action;
*  This action can be for the community itself to manage or avoid impacts,
PRCU/CSPs to provide specific advice, or if necessary, technical advice to be
sought from elsewhere;
* The forms will be reviewed by the PRCU Environmental and Social Mitigation
Officers at the quarterly CCTP meetings before construction or operations
begin.
Please note that all formats for checklists presented in this report will be copied
into a Microsoft word document that can be used to provide an electronic record.
Selection of the 'forms' toolbar in Microsoft word enables the document to be
'locked' by clicking on the padlock icon, so that the shaded text areas and
checkboxes can be filled.

6.3.1        'Positive' environmental micro-projects
The PRCU Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers should also be responsible
for raising Contract Service Providers' awareness of the potential for communities
to identify micro-projects with an explicitly 'environmental' nature. PRCUs
would in turn have the responsibility for sensitising communities to the
willingness of CBRDP/SILEM to finance these projects, should the communities
prioritise them.
Table 6.2 provides an initial list of 'positive' environmental micro-projects which
fall under the eligible investments described in the Project Appraisal Document,
funded by CBRDP/SILEM or otherwise.

6.4          SCREENING OF INTER-VILLAGE PROJECTS
Figure 6.3 sets out a simple process that Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers
will apply to prevent and mitigate against environmental and social impacts of
'inter-community' or CIVGT micro-projects financed under the Local Investment
Fund component. Under the LIF, a number eligible inter-village projects have
been identified in the following broad categories: forest management, pastoral
management, and socio-economic infrastructure. Under the program, eligibility
for these inter-village projects also requires that they are no larger than
US$150,000, and that execution of these micro-projects are handled by the
project's provincial operational teams. This form can also work for SILEM
supported projects.

The Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers, through the PRCUs with support
of the CCTPs, will participate in the targeting and identification of the project.
This will allow for a smooth process, since it will enable the officers to prevent the
financing of projects for which it is impossible to mitigate negative environmental
and social impacts. Following identification, an Environmental and Social Mitigation
Officer will complete an environmental and social review checklist (Format 6.2).
This is similar to the community micro-project checklist, but it differs in two key
respects:
* It allows more information to be given on the reasoning for the yes/no
answers;
* It culminates in a decision on whether a further in-depth EIA is required or
whether other safeguard requirements such as a Resettlement Action Plan, a
mini-pest management plan or a mini-waste management plan is necessary.

It is important to note that this screening checklist may lead to two courses of
action: either a full EIA, or no further action. It is anticipated that a full EIA will
not be warranted for all sub-projects. A suggested standard format for EIA is
provided in Annex 7.
6.4.1        Triggersfor cumulative impact assessments
The compilation of screening forms will enable each PRCU Environmnental and
Social Mitigation Officer to decide whether additional cumulative impact
assessments are required to assess cumulative impacts on groundwater resources,
surface water resources, and sources of materials. In each case, the officers must
relate a number of projects to the receptors of impacts:
Groundwater resources
* Trigger: where CBRDP/SILEM finances the rehabilitation or construction of
more than 15 boreholes/wells in a community;
* Action: Engage government and NGOs across the provinces in an assessment
of the cumulative impact of all borehole rehabilitation / construction in the
communities on groundwater resources;
Surface water resources
* Trigger: where CBRDP/SILEM finances more than 15 small-scale irrigation
projects along any one watercourse;
* Action: Engage government and NGOs across the catchment in an assessment
of the cumulative impact of all irrigation schemes extracting irrigation water
from the watercourse;
Sources of materials
*  Trigger: where CBRDP/SILEM finances more than 50 micro-projects using
timber, sand or gravel or any other construction material from the same single
source, whether in the local area or outside of the project area;
* Action: Cumulative impact assessment to ascertain significance of this
extraction, to make recommendations on alternative course of action.

* Conclusions on whether the project is maximising its positive contribution to
natural resources and environmental management;
* Areas for improvement and practical recommendations.
6.7         MONITORING AND EVALUATION
There are two opportunities be taken to build a simple system for the monitoring
and evaluation of environmental and social impacts:
* The PCU NRM officer should consider the environmental and social criteria
that require measurement (eg groundwater levels etc); A list of initial
proposals is given below;
* Using this list of criteria, a set of indicators can be integrated into the
recording forms used'in the early warning systems in each district; (this will
ensure flexibility between districts, as well as a participatory approach to
environmental monitoring).
6.7.1       Initial proposals
The key issues to be considered in the CBRDP/SILEM include monitoring of
water quality, biodiversity indicators, agricultural production, income generation,
health and population influx. The goals of monitoring are to measure the success
rate of the project, determine whether interventions have resulted in dealing with
negative impacts, whether further interventions are needed or monitoring is to be
extended in some areas. Monitoring indicators will be very much dependent on
specific project contexts.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT               GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO
79



Monitoring and surveillance of CBRDP/SILEM micro-projects will take place on
a "spot check" basis at it would be impossible to monitor all the micro-projects to
be financed under the project. The spot checks consist of controlling the
establishment of mitigation measures. It is not recommended to collect large
amounts of data, but rather to base monitoring on observations by project
technicians and stakeholders to determine the trends in indicators.
Monitoring of participation process
The following are indicators for monitoring of the participation process involved
in the CBRDP/SILEM activities.
*  Number and percentage of affected households consulted during the
planning stage;
*  Levels of decision-making of affected people;
*  Level of understanding of project impacts and mitigation;
*  Effectiveness of local authorities to make decisions;
* Frequency and quality of public meetings;
*  Degree of involvement of women or disadvantaged groups in discussions.
Monitoring of implementation of mitigation plans
Tables 6.3 and 6.4 lists the recommended indicators for monitoring the
implementation of mitigation plans.
Evaluation of Results
The evaluation of results of environmental mitigation can be carried out by
comparing baseline data collected in the planning phases with targets and post-
project situations.

7           CAPACITY-BUILDING AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
In order to ensure proper implementation of environmental and social screening
and mitigation measures, as well as effective natural resource management, the
CBRDP/SILEM will undertake an intensive program of environmental training
and institutional capacity building. This will build on previous efforts made
during Phase I of the program.
7.1         ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING AND SENSmSATION
Training and sensitisation will be required at the levels of CCTPs, Environmental
and Social Mitigation Officers, CVGT/CIVGT, and Community workers. The
PCU NRM Officer, Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers and additional
experts will provide experts to deliver a range of technical training on
environmental issues to these groups. Table 7.1 sets out the specific training
requirements of each of these levels. The objective of this training is to build the
capacity in these groups for implementation of the ESMF to be supported under
the project.
For each group, training will be provided to bring them to a different level of
expertise in different areas (refer to Table 7.1):
* In -depth training to a level that allows trainees to go on to train others,
including technical procedures where relevant;
* Sensitisation, in which the trainees become familiar with the issues to a
sufficient extent that it allows them to demand their precise requirements for
further technical assistance; and
* Awareness-raising in which the participants acknowledge the significance or
relevance of the issues, but are not required to have technical or in-depth
knowledge of the issues.

T = detailed training, S = sensitisation to the issues, A = raised awareness.
The details of the training to be carried out are set out in Table 7.2. Programs will
also include training trainers for extension services to the communities and
providing refresher courses from time to time in all of the topics identified.
As part of the Local Capacihj Building component, the CBRDP/SILEM will also
provide basic training and support awareness raising for local community
representatives and interested members of the project communities. The objective
of the awareness training is to mobilise the interest and participation of villages,
existing local-level institutions, and traditional authorities to organise themselves
at the level of villages, and inter-villages. The training programs aim to build
capacity within CVGT/CIVGTs and the CASs to successfully plan, implement
and maintain village level investments.
An example of an agenda for proposed training focused on environmental and
social issues is given in Box 7.1.

The objective of this training is to raise the level of environmental awareness in
the communities, promote adoption of the screening checklist by literate
community members, and raise awareness that the CBRDP/SILEM can finance
environmental micro-projects should the community choose these. The training
will also build support for the screening and mitigation process, which originates
at the community level.

The training and sensitisation program recommended above will be supported by
the Technical Support to Community Organisations sub-component. This sub-
component aims to provide to the CGVT and the CAS technical backup for
carrying out their annual investment plans. The support will be provided by the
provincial teams and delegated to third parties (Contract Service Providers,
NGOs or government technical services) when necessary.
7.2          RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING
At present, capacity to implement these recommendations is low, with few
qualified staff in the existing CVGT/CIVGTs and PRCUs. Where staff exists,
training in the application of environmental and social screening is needed. In
addition, it will be necessary to appoint Environnental and Social Mitigation Officers
in the PRCUs, and to build awareness and knowledge in environmental and
social screening amongst the decentralized levels of administration.
The CBRDP/SILEM will address these deficiencies in accordance with investment
for capacity-building across the regional, provincial and inter-village
administrations. Where gaps exist in terms of staff availability or qualified staff at
each level of project implementation (national, provincial and community),
measures will be taken throughout the project life cycle to hire skilled personnel
and train staff.

Figure 7.1     Typical agenda for a 2-day workshop on ESMF's Screening and Review Process
Day I
(a) Introduction to Environmental Impact Assessment
This section will introduce participants to the theory and application of EIA as a decision
making tool. It will outline the principles of EIA and provide clear definitions on EIA practice
terminology (e.g. screening and scoping, impacts [negative, positive, cumulative, strategic]
natural resource base (water, soil, land, biodiversity, air, etc., mitigation and monitoring). Social
issues as they should be mainstreamed into the EA process will also be discussed.
(b) World Bank Safeguard Policies and Legislation of Burkina Faso
This section will discuss the principle World Bank safeguard policies and their application to
subprojects under the CBRDP/SILEM. Each policy will be discussed in detail. In addition, the
applicable Burkina Faso legislation will be discussed in terms of the relevant environmental
laws and policies, land tenure, and community planning which apply to activities under the
program.
(c) Screening and Scoping of Sub-projects
A list of potential activities to be financed under the Local Investment Fund will be discussed.
Application of the screening checklist (formats in Chapter 6) for community investments and
the scoping checklist for inter-village investments will be explained using case studies.
Day2
(d) Impact Identification
Potential impacts related to various types of activities will be discussed, in terms of their
significance (adverse or minimal, positive or negative), magnitude (long term versus short
term), and impact category (localised or cumulative). Types of social and environmental
impacts will be explained. Triggers for identifying impact types as set out in Chapter 6 will also
be explained.
(e) Mitigation and Monitoring
Mitigation measures as they apply to various types of investments will be discussed, in terms of
their application, cost and feasibility. Monitoring measures will also be recommended to
measure the effectiveness of mitigation plans and to monitor performance.
(d) Responsibilitiesfor Planning and Reporting
For each target audience, responsibilities for environmental management, EIA planning and
resettlement planning will be discussed as they relate to the CBRDP/SILEM implementation.
This will include responsibilities for planning, management of impact identification and
mitigation/monitoring, partnerships with NGOs and technical service providers, partnerships
among community members, and reporting.

8            ESTIMATED COSTS
The breakdown of estimated costs in for putting the ESMF into operation is
provided in Table 8.1. This includes the costs of providing the training set out in
C1apter 7.
8.1          COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCUAL INPUTS
The total estimated costs for mainstreaming environmental and social concerns
over an indicative period of six years into the CBRDP/SILEM is USD 1,370,000.
Some of these costs may be already covered under the existing budget of the
Project. However, most of the proposed budget lines are separately identified in
the project budget (particularly relating to training and impacts assessments): this
will ensure that the ESMF has significant 'clout' within the operation of the
project, and is not sidelined.
A specific responsibility of the PCU NRM Officer will be to report on expenditure
within the project that can be explicitly related to mainstreaming of safeguard
concerns. This will be one way of monitoring the extent that environmental and
social issues are being addressed.
8.2          MAINSTREAM COSTS
Some costs of environmental management and impact mitigation are directly
integrated into the main project budget. Specifically these are:
* Costs related to mitigation measures for micro-projects, which will be
assessed and intemalised as part of the overall micro-project cost;
* Costs related to mitigation measures for inter-village projects, which will be
assessed and intemalised as part of the overall micro-project cost;
* Cost of studies related to strategic issues of natural resources management,
which are internalised into the sub-component of the SILEM's Local Investmnent
Fund.
8.3          COSTS OF TRAINING
Again, the total estimated cost for expenses associated with training and
sensitisation, is included in Table 8.1. This estimate does not include the cost of
recruiting any new PRCU Environmental and Social Mitigation Officers, who will
be the lead facilitators of training program in each province. It is assumed that
existing PRCU staff may be suitable candidates for these positions.

METHODOLOGY
The first stage in this study involved a desk-based analysis of the project appraisal
document (PAD) for the CBRDP (also referred to as PNGT 2), the draft PAD for the
SILEM Program and associated papers and reports. This was carried out
immediately prior to departure for Burkina Faso and during the first week after
arrival in country (14-21 March 2003). The World Bank and the CBRDP
Coordination Unit provided most of the documents. Others important sources of
information were identified based on recommendations received during meetings
with government stakeholders. The list of reports and documents reviewed is
provided in Annex 4.
Stakeholder interviews in Ouagadougou and in several of the PNGT2 Provinces
The second stage involved carrying out stakeholder interviews in country and
making field trips to several of the provinces where CBRDP is already operating, and
to areas that may be targeted for financing of SILEM activities and support. The
ESMF team conducted a series of visits with stakeholders and key informants in
Ouagadougou, Kouritenga Province (Koupela), Houet/Tuy Province (Bobo
Dioulasso), Soum Province (Djibo), and Gnagna Province (Bogande).
Stakeholder consultation
Stakeholder consultation was one of the key tools to achieve the ESMF objectives.
The ESMF team had an opportunity to visit representative areas where the earlier
PNGT1 pilot project (1992-1998) and other agencies and NGOs have conducted rural
development activities in the past. The team was also shown areas where CBRDP is
already present and will conduct new activities, and areas where potential
intervention by the SILEM program may be possible. An intensive schedule of
interviews with key stakeholders and informants, especially in representative
villages at the provincial level, was followed. A typical agenda of a meeting would
include an introduction of the ESMF team, and introduction of
participants/consultees, a brief overview of the project (both CBRDP and SILEM),
views and comments of the consultees, and specific questions from the ESMF team
regarding their priorities and strategies for development, details of environmental
and social sensitivities, individual and community interaction with the environment,
and potential impacts of the project.
Key stakeholders consulted on the project included:
* Ministry officials, and other relevant agencies present in Ouagadougou;
* Provincial Ministry representatives;
*  Community administrations and organisations (CVGT, CIVGT, CAS, etc.);
* Community members in each of the villages visited; and,
* International development agencies, and staff of agency-funded projects.

A detailed table of those consulted and a brief synthesis of discussion points follows.
1.2 Field visits
Four separate field visits to representative provinces of Kouritenga, Houet/Tuy,
Soum and Gnagna were carried out over a period of about ten days in March 2003.
The objective of the visits was to meet and consult with provincial CBRDP teams,
governments, and agencies, as well as with potential participant communities, and to
learn as much as possible about CBRDP activities and issues, potential activities and
issues of the proposed SILEM program. Importantly, the field work served to verify
our initial analysis of potential environmental and social impacts of the overall
Project.
1.3 Wrap-up and completion
Periodic debriefing sessions were held with the CBRDP Coordination Unit in
Ouagadougou throughout the mission. A final debriefing was scheduled for 2 April,
2003 before the ESMF team departed, to present and discuss preliminary findings
based on recent fieldwork. Unfortunately this debriefing did not take place, as the
CBRDP Coordination Unit was wholly preoccupied with a World Bank supervision
mission and were absent from Ouagadougou. However, after comments are
received and incorporated from stakeholders and ASPEN on a draft of this report, a
final debriefing could be envisioned to present and discuss the final report.

Periodic debriefings on progress of mission (see below).
Ministere de l'Enironnement et du Cadre de Vie
Jean Baptiste Kambou: Ingenieur Forestier, Conseiller Technique
* Mr. Kambou is the GEF focal point for Burkina Faso. He ensures that all projects
conform to environmental requirements and GEF policies (e.g. ensured synergy
between PNGT and PAGEN where zones of intervention are very clear).

* SILEM Program was first presented at a GEF workshop in April 2000. There is a
need to ensure participative conservation on projects around protected areas.
* The Cadre de Concertation Techique Provincial (about 40 participants) meets
every three months at a provincial level and is seen as an effective venue for the
ministry to review proposed PNGT 2-funded projects. PNGT 1 experienced
problems of socio-economic nature, in that it did not take into consideration the
true priorities of population. PNGT 2 has attempted to address these constraints.
* Bureau de Suivi des ONG (BSONG - Bureau for monitoring NGOs) is responsible
for monitoring NGOs such as Naturama working in the Kabore-Tembi National
Park, ANPF in the Valle d Sourou, ANAR associated with IUCN, etc.).
Honore Toe: Directeur General de l'Environnement (DEP)
Jean Lingiani: Directeur des Evaluations Environnementales (DGE)
* EA Guidelines were drafted in 2001, classifies projects according to size and
category (e.g. Cat. A, B, C).
* Departement des Etudes et de la Planification (Department of Studies and
Planning) responsible for reviewing and approving all donor-funded projects
and to ensure that environmental concerns and issues are addressed.
* Ministry of Environment participates in PNGT 2 meetings, and receives training
support (e.g. Cadre de Concertation Technique Provincial - which is perceived as
being effective due to participatory nature).
* Suggests that the following reports be obtained and consulted:
1. Rapport de letat de l'environnement au Burkina Faso (2002)
2. Plan d'environnement pour un developpement durable (2002)
3. Programme national de plan d'action contre la desertification (took three years to
develop, many organizations were involved in drafting this document).
* PNGT 1 had heavy focus on forestry development, established forest teams in 13
provinces.
Conseil National de l'Environnenment et du Developpement Durable (CONEDD)
Sambou Coulibaly: Secretaire Permanent
Mamadou Honadia: Charge de Convention Changement Climatique
* CONEDD is divided into three branches:
1. Conferences
2. Permanent Secretariat
3. Special Commissions (e.g Natural Resources, Environmental Education, etc.)
* Government is placing environmental cells or units at the department level
within various ministries, CONEDD is responsible for coordination. Twelve are
planned, although only four a functioning (i.e Ministere de l'Education de Base,
Ministere de l'Education Superieur, Ministere de l'Agriculture, and Ministere des
Mines et Energie). There are 31 total ministries in Burkina Faso.

* INERA is already working in certain areas of the country on wetland
development, especially in the West and Southwest. INERA received FAO
support undertake a five-year study. Program was recently completed.
* Suggestions that the SILEM project will work in other zones, especially toward
the North but can use experience of INERA.
* Explanation of Government national implementation strategy/action plan for the
following three conventions:
1. Climate Change
2. Biodiversity
3. Desertification
* Discussion on National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) completed in 1991
which included frameworks in:
1. "Gestion Terroirs" (PNGT)
2. Amenagement Patrimoine (sp) Nationaux
3. Amelioration du Cadre de Vie
NEAP was revised to include the international conventions (see above) in 1994. A
second revision is presently underway but still in draft.
*  After a conference convened by CONAGESE in 2002, the decision to restructure
was made and CONAGESE's name changed to CONEDD. New organization
will focus on environment, economic and social issues with an overall objective
of sustainable development. CONEDD provides advice to various Government
Ministries and has a 5 year mandate to execute their given tasks above.
*   Ministry of Environment and Water has changed to Ministry of Environment
and Livelihoods ("Cadre de Vie"). Primary departments are:
1. General Direction of the Environment
2. Livelihoods ("Cadre de Vie")
3. Water and Forests

different from traditional or tribal systems but can be led by same hierarchy.
CVGTs have sub-committees such as livestock, agriculture, land tenure
(necessary) and foresty/environment. Varies from one village to another based
on need.
* Developed PGTs (Plan de Gestion Terroir - Village Development Plans) for five
years.
*   Micro projects include: soil restoration; wells, schools, local language training
centers, health centers, transportation infrastructure (e.g. raiders-concrete or
stone crossing structures across stream beds)
*   Move toward communal system under consideration. Only two exist at the
moment in Ouagadougou for municipal areas. Rural communes would allow
grouping of villages and believed would facilitate delivery of services
* Brief discussion on composition of team, development of village development
plans (Plan de Gestion Terroir Villageois), capacity building and micro projects
supported under PNGT 2.

* Visited functioning literacy training center (CPAF). CPAF provides training in
local language, and is attended by both men and women of varying ages.
* Visited lowland (bas fond) developed for rice cultivation on 7 hectares financed
by PNGT 1. Area was divided up into 0.25 ha parcels and is cultivated by 40
families. Yields are estimated at about two metric tons per ha. Water levels in
fields are controlled by two low concrete structures with a single slide gate in the
middle. Seeking funding to construct an additional dike to bring additional area
under cultivation.
* Discussed social and economic issues faced by people living above and below the
low concrete structures, with regards to access to water during wet and dry
season.
* Shown upstream area where erosion and sedimentation seems to be a problem.
Villagers themselves have attempted to address problems by placing stones but
incoming water velocities too high and problem persists. Suggests need to
investigate and establish viable upstream protection measures.
* Discussed the participatory processes by which the training center and the low
concrete structure were agreed upon for micro-investments.

* Visited functioning borehole (forage) equipped with mechanical hand pump.
Clean water was first priority of the village.
* Village now seeks funds for rock bunds/ tied ridges (cordons pierreux) for land
restoration and a storage structure for grain.
* Village numbers about 500 inhabitants, has functioning CVGT (with 36 members
participating in general assembly). The bureau or office is composed of 11 men
and four women. There is also a land tenure commnittee (Comite de Foncier)
composed of four persons, including the traditional village chief who is aware of
land tenure issues.
* Discussed system of compensation for land used for the projects; no
compensation was given, and the owner of the land claimed he was honored to
donate land for his community. The land was not previously used for
agricultural purposes, nor was it used for housing.
* Discussed socio-economic pressures on the growing community due to lack of
water.

Government
Cdt. Golane Pierre: Inspecteur des Eaux et Forets, Directeur Provincial, Direction
Regionale de l'Environnement et des Eaux et Forets des Hauts-Bassins
* Responsible for three provinces for forest management, wildlife management,
and fisheries.
* Forestry responsibilities include forest management training and regulatory
enforcement.
* Wildlife responsibilities include wildlife conservation management, hunting
regulations and anti-poaching.
* Fishery production activities are managed by Ministry of Agriculture but training
and enforcement is responsibility of the Regional Direction of Environment.
* Livelihoods (Cadre de Vie) include working for the municipality of Bobo
Dioulasso on environment issues (e.g. pollution, sanitation and waste
management, etc.) and managing green spaces.
* Primary constraints are lack of personnel and means to cover 13 departments in 3
provinces (e.g. 9 staff cover all departments, which is equivalent to 36 villages per
person. Villages do not necessarily follow training recommendations so
enforcement is necessary. Desired strategy is to involve population from start,
provide good training and get to assist with enforcement.

* Several government codes are too general and require development of more
applied guidelines. Some codes are contradictory and issues need to be resolved
(e.g. exploring for minerals in a classified forest).
* CCTP is an effective means for government agency participation. Choice of
PNGT 2 villages is presented and made here.
* Other projects working in the area include: PDRI (Projet de Developpement
Rural Integre - funded by AFD); Protection des Berges - funded by CILSS.
* Areas where SILEM could concentrate are: revegetation of denuded areas for
livestock use; agriculture, environment (better overall land management);
improved communication methods to help resolve specific problems.
Sangare Abdoulaye: DPAHRH du Houet
* Responsible for rural water supply (boreholes and wells). Program to drill in 200
boreholes in 2003. Require about 750 to meet present needs.
* Well are mostly established for livestock purposes. Program to develop 12 in
2003.
* Other small wells need for small-scale irrigation (vegetable gardens). Installed
four boreholes on 50 ha for irrigation to provide for dry season cultivation but
people not used to this and require assistance.
* Only one dam project under consideration at the moment. Project a feasibility
stage. Contractor is responsible for conducting studies, including environmental
assessment (EA).
* Expressed a desire that CCTP become more directly involved in following up on
implemented activities (e.g. PNGT I funded construction of small dam but
downstream irrigation never developed as planned).

* Introduction to local team and brief discussion of mission objectives and
provincial activities.
* Constraints are inability of team to follow up directly with villages due to small
team size and large coverage area. Desire capacity to follow up on private
contractors selected to work with villages to develop village development plans
(PGT).
* Want PNGT 2 to reconsider decision not to directly fund income generation
activities (e.g. grinding mills).
* Social considerations are made through the community development plan; there
is variation in the quality of participatory assessment and strategic development
based on the quality of the contractor.

production has failed for the past two years due to a problem with birds, and
inability of local population to maintain effective guard during the
planting/harvest season. Seeking additional funding to continue and improve.
* Visited woodlot (approximately 50 ha) placed with a classified forest (foret
classe). Managed by group of 306 people of which 224 are women. Participants
receive 1,700 fCFA per taire (1 meter square) for firewood of which about 1,000

fCFA is revenue. Bobo Dioulasso has requested 30,000 taires this year.
Regeneration is becoming a problem and the group is seeking funding to replant.
* Participation in the classified forest scheme was done on a first-come, first-served
basis such that the poor were not necessarily targeted to join. Notably,
participants in the scheme are able to pocket a percentage of the revenues for
their own use.
* Visited newly constructed UCGF center funded by 100 fCFA tax collected from
each taire sold from 20 villages participating in union. Two buildings - one for
forest management bureau (elected) and the other for training.

*  Village of migrants (peuhl) started 30 years ago. Most migrants came from North
(Ouahiyagouya area) due to the severe drought in the mid 1970s. The village is
predominantly Muslim.
* Worked previously with PNGT 1 to organize and prioritize problems (e.g. water
well for livestock, forage production and training, livestock management).
* Livestock well operating and villagers were consulted on well placement. Tried
to avoid putting this in an occupied field. PNGT 1 contributed two-thirds
towards cost and villagers one-third in form of construction material and labor.
* Village has about 30 households, 3,000 head of cattle and 500 goats and sheep.
Villagers indicated that the well is mostly adequate for needs.
* Discussed land tenure (historic and present) formalities for obtaining land from
native village (autotchone) who are primarily animists/Christians. Tradition is
to present a gift (e.g. chicken) when requesting land and provide a symbolic gift
of grain (e.g. millet) each year after harvest.
*  Discussed social and economic constraints of a growing migrant village in a
agricultural area. New migrants are having a difficult time obtaining access to
resources and land.
* Discussed how the community addresses conflict with regards to access to
natural resources, and religion. Traditionally, the chiefs of each group meet and if
they cannot resolve their differences an arbitrator is used.

* Village has about 300 inhabitants and has been in existence about 34 years.
Requested permission from native village of Kadomba for land.
* Primary activities are agriculture, livestock and sylvo-culture (forestry).
*  10 families migrated from C6te d'Ivoire and others from North (Yatenga).
*  First arrivals paid for land with a sheep, land is now limited and increasingly
difficult to find and request. Villagers provide symbolic gift of grain to Kadomba
each year after harvest. Number of new arrivals is declining.
* Village has developed 5 year Village Development Plan (PGT). Priorities are:
1. Reverse land degradation -establish rock bunds (cordons pierreux).
2. Improve soil fertility - use organic fertilizer
3. Reforestation
4. Water - village only has one borehole and pump.
* PNGT 1 supported the establishment of a small vegetable garden with a well but
elephant intrusion has been a problem.
*  Villages has multiple special committees (CAS) such as:
1. GGF - Forest Management Group
2. GVF - Village Women's Group
3. GPC (2) - Cotton Producers Group
4. GVE - Livestock Management Group
5. Conseil au GGF (small group of village elders that provide advice)
6. APA - Association for the Promotion of Literacy
* Within GGF they have several subgroups for: commercial firewood harvesting,
bush fire protection, reforestation, deforestation protection, etc.
* Primary issues from men's standpoint are to address insufficient potable water,
health center (nearest is 18 km from village), grain and supply storage.
* Primary issues from women's standpoint are establishing a village grain mill and
a dispensary/maternity.

activities. Committee was not created with a construct of poor vs. non-poor
representatives in mind.
* Adjoining borehole developed in 1995 at a cost of 7 million fCFA (45 meter
depth). The village chief allocated land with condition that it is located 100
meters from nearest field to allow for animal passage. Well was originally
intended for livestock agent (living adjacent to vaccination park) and animals
using park. Turned over to village due to water shortages. Pump broken down
for over one week due to over use. Committee searching for necessary part.
* Little to no conflict between livestock and agriculture due to fact livestock
movements occur during November/ December after harvest, and that livestock
provide needed fertilizer during the planting season.

* Visited Kossougoudou Barrage (dam). Constructed during colonial period (1959)
using forced labor. Original purpose was to provide a reservoir primarily for
livestock use. Dam modified in 1999 to allow development of about 35 ha
irrigation scheme, primarily for rice and maize production (and some dry season
vegetable gardening). Parcels range from 0.15 to 0.25 ha and have been
distributed to about 183 households/participants. Among the participants are 3
women's groups with 0.25 ha each and one youth group with 0.25 ha. The five
concerned villages (surrounding the dam) met and determined distribution
criteria.
* Dam spillway is experiencing operational problems. Population has attempted
to recover spillway channel for cultivation, which cause blockage, especially
during high runoff year. Spillway protection dikes have collapsed in places and
population is seeking PNGT 2 funding to help fund the repair. Unless cultivation
is prohibited in the spillway channel, this problem will likely persist.
* Environmental and Social Assessment was reported done prior to 1999.
Population notes increase in pressure on surrounding areas, especially around
reservoir, from livestock. Beginning to adopt measures to control animal

PNGT 2 support for soil recovery and restoration. Rock source is about 1-2 km
distance from fields. Use donkey driven carts to recover stones. One hectare
requires about 3 bunds spaced at 100m intervals. One cart of stones costs about
25OfCFA, but to avoid problems farmers pay a lump sum of 15,OOOfCFA per ha.
* Also introducing reforestation using acacia species. Paying 75 fCFA per tree at a
private nursery. Objective is to recover abandoned land that was formerly
cultivated but is now degraded beyond use. Positive benefit is that population
that would have normally be forced to migrate can remain and continue to
cultivate.
* Population is concerned that arable land is running out making it difficult to
divide among family (father to son, husband to wife).

was destroyed by large flood event and was reconstructed. Irrigation
infrastructure was started but never completed. Population is seeking additional
funding from PNGT 2 to finish the work.
* Population intends to cultivate about 10 ha of rice, maize, potatoes, vegetables,
etc. on 0.15-0.25 ha plots working in groups. Land distribution has not yet been
done. Group approach adopted due to large population concerned living in 11
villages surrounding the dam.

I             POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
1.1          INTRODUCTION
Environmental protection in Burkina Faso is highly imperative due to the
increasing risks of land degradation and desertification, affecting both the
country's rural economy and natural resource base.
To date, there has been progress in environmental protection and natural
resource management and a number of environmental policies and strategies
have been adopted by the Government which reflects this. EIA legislation,
however, is relatively new which means that few projects have been assessed
adequately for their potential impacts on the natural resource base.
Moreover, according to officials at the Ministry of Environment and
Sustainable Livelihoods, a recently formed institution, there is currently weak
capacity to manage environmental issues. This is an area which will be
supported with training under the CBRDP/SILEM program.
This section briefly outlines the policy, legal and administrative framework for
environmental management in Burkina Faso.
1.2           POLICY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
1.2.1         National Environmental Policies
Burkina Faso was one of the first countries in Africa to formulate its National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). The Plan was approved by the
Government in 1991. Much of the government's policy on the environment is
defined by the NEAP, which is the overall strategic framework covering three
framework type programmes aimed at the management of specific
environmental issues. These framework programmes include:
Box 1.1       Strategic Environmental Frameworks
o   A framework programme for the management of the national heritage, which comprises
programmes and projects in forestry (national programme for village forestry, the national
forest management programme, the wood energy programme), land development plans,
programmes and projects for water, soils, wildlife and fisheries;
o   A framework programme for land management takes into account the national land
management programme, integrated programmes and rural development programmes;
o  The framework programme for improving the living environment comprises urban and
small town development projects, village water projects, construction programmes and
projects for schools, clinics and access roads for farm produce.

1.2.2        Laws Relating to Environment and Natural Resource Management
Code of Environment
The driving legislation for environmental protection in Burkina Faso is the
Code de l'Environnement, or Code of Environment Law No 002/94/ADP of 19
January 1994. The Code has appointed the Ministry of Environment and
Sustainable Livelihoods (formerly called the Ministry of Environment and
Water) as the institution responsible for environmental management,
pollution control, and protection and conservation of natural resources.
Article 4 of the Code describes the requirements for projects with potential
impacts to undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Articles 6
and 7 provide a more detailed description of the outline of an EIA report, and
the procedures for preparation and disclosing the report.
Guidelinesfor Environmental Impact Assessment
In parallel with the Code, a Decret No 2001-342 for EIA legislation was passed
in 2001 by the Council of Ministers. The legislation outlines the application
procedures, categories of environmental classification for various types of
projects and programmes, and the requirements for approval and review of
EIAs.
Annex F provides the tables for environmental classification as they are listed
in the decree.
Other pertinent laws and legislation
There are also several other laws and legislation which relate to environmental
protection and natural resource management. These include:
o  Law No 006/97/ADP (31 January 1997) for forestry
o  Law No 23/94/ADP (19 May 1994) for public heath
o  Law No 014/96/ADP (23 May 1996) for agrarian and land tenure reform
o  Decree No 98-337/PRES/PM/MEE (30 July 1998) for the organization,
responsibilities and functions of the national council for environmental
management (CONEDD); and
o  Law 23/97/1I/AN (22 October 1997) for mining.
Burkina Faso has also developed specific strategies and action plans to deal
with the issues of soil fertility and land degradation, desertification, loss of
biodiversity, and deforestation. These are illustrated in Table 1.1.

Table 1.1    National Strategies and Action Plans
StrategiyiPlan              Description
National Environment Action  The NEAP was approved by the Government in 1991.
Plan (NEAP)                 The Plan groups existing and planned environmental
management actions into four "Programmatic
Agendas": national resource management; village-level
land management; improving living standards; and
developing environmental. The Programmatic Agendas
are complemented by two support programs, (1)
managing information on the environment, and (2)
coordinating and monitoring the NEAP.
National Soil Fertility     The SNGIFS/PAGIFS was presented by the GoBF in its
Management Strategy and     Document Operational Strategique in 1999 as its top
Action Plan (SNGIFS/PAGIFS)  priority action plan for the agricultural sector. The plan
of January 1999             focuses mainly on replenishment of soil nutrients in the
Sahel and on Mossi plateau using the local rock
phosphate (Burkina phosphate).
National Desertification    The major role of the PAN/LCD is to encourage and
Mitigation Action Plan      promote the process of participatory and decentralized
(PAN/LCD of July 1999)      planning (i.e. elaboration process of local development
programs) and the use of the community based
development approach as the most effective approach
for combating desertification.
National Biodiversity Strategy  The objectives of the strategy are to provide a platform
and Action Plan (2001)      for protection of the country's biodiversity and
endangered species and to promote sustainable natural
resource use and management. The Strategy outlines
the priorities for the next 25 years (2001-2025) while the
Action Plan sets priorities for the next 5 years (2001-
2005).
National Program for Land   The NPLM aims to integrate agriculture, forestry and
Management (NPLM)           fisheries and encourage sustainable land use and
natural resource management.
1.3          ADMINISTRATrVE FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
1.3.1        National Level Administration
There are various agencies and institutions involved at the national level in
environmental management as described below.
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Livelihoods
Responsibilities for environmental management fall under the auspices of the
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Livelihoods (MESL). The MESL was
established in November 2000 under Decree No 2000-143/ PRES/ PM/ MEE (17
April 2000). National environmental programs and policies are administered
under the Director General of Environment, Director Generalfor Water and Forests,
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANACEMENT                   GOVERNMENTOF BURKINA FAsO



and Director Generalfor Sustainable Livelihoods and steered by the National
Councilfor Environmental Management and Sustainable Development (CONEDD).
Permanent Secretariat of the National Councilfor Environmental Management and
Sustainable Development (SP/CONEDD)
SP/CONEDD, formerly known as CONAGESE, was established as part of
Decree 2000-143, and recently reorganised in January 2003.
The Council is composed of representatives of various ministerial
departments, institutions and agencies concerned with environmental
protection; representatives of environmental associations, private sector
representatives and experience environmental professionals/experts.
This council is responsible for providing technical guidance to the Minister of
Environment and Sustainable Livelihoods on the application of policies and
strategies which concern the environment and natural resource management.
A detailed diagram of the MESL and the various branches and departments of
the government involved in environmental management is provided as Figure
1.1.
Other Line Ministries and Institutions in Burkina Faso
There are also a number of other line ministries and organisations which also
have duties in environmental protection and management. The GoB is
currently placing environmental cells or units at the department level within
various ministries, and CONED is responsible for coordination. Twelve
cells/units are planned, although only four a functioning at the moment
(Ministere de l'Education de Base, Ministere de l'Education Superieur,
Ministere de l'Agriculture, and Ministere des Mines et Energie). There are 31
total ministries in Burkina Faso.
1.3.2        Regional and local level administration
At the decentralized levels, there are various branches of the MESL which
have responsibilities in environmental management and protection, as
indicated in Figure 1.1.
At the provincial level, the Provincial Directorfor Environment and Sustainable
Livelihoods, will manage environmental issues for each province. At the
regional level, the Regional Directorfor Environment and Sustainable Livelihoods,
will be supervising and implementing proposed activities.
At the local level, there are smaller bureaus working with the MESL, including
o Bureau of National Parks, Reserves for Fauna and Flora;
o Bureau for Forestry Management and the Bureau for Rural Forestry;
o Bureau for Combating Desertification;
o Bureau for Environmental Evaluation;

Detailed Baseline Data



1           BASELINE INFORMATION
This chapter provides a baseline socio-economic analysis of Burkina Faso relevant
to CBRDP and SILEM project sites.
1.1         IDENTIFICATION OF PROJECT SITES
For the first phase (2002-2005), CBRDP will cover 2000 villages in 26 provinces
throughout the country. SILEM program will support rehabilitation of degraded
lowland ecosystems for Burkina Faso's northem provinces of Soum, Oudalan,
Seno, Yatenga, Loroum and Bam (100 villages) located in the northern Sahelian
zone, covering 36, 829 sq km (13.4% of the country), and 662,129 inhabitants.
For the second, third and fourth phases (2006-2015), CBRDP aims to extend to all
45 provinces of Burkina Faso, whereas SILEM intends to cover 600 lowland
villages and related micro-basin and watershed rural communities. SILEM's
main project implementation areas are expected to be the following:
* Northern Sahel sylvo-pastoral and wildlife reserve;
* The protected natural habitats on the central Mossi plateau; and
* The protected natural habitats in the Eastern, Southern and Western
provinces.
Since CBRDP intends to cover all rural villages in Burkina Faso by the end of
Phase II, this baseline analysis will focus on the rural situation. Also, the baseline
chapter will provide information pertaining to protected natural habitats to be
covered by SILEM program.
1.2          BURKINA FASO: BACKGROUND
* Burkina Faso is situated in West Africa and bordered to the North and
West by Mali, to the east by Niger, to the Southeast by Benin and to the
South by Togo, Ghana and C6te d'Ivoire.
* Burkina Faso has a total area of 274,200 sq. km. (106,000 sq. mi.).
* There is an estimated population of 11.6 million people, with a growth
rate of 3.2 per annum. (1)
* Capital City is Ouagadougou (pop.1 million), and other major cities are
Bobo-Dioulasso (450,000) and Koudougou (90,000).
* GDP per capita was US $214 in 2001.
* According to the Human Development Index, Burkina Faso is among the
ten least developed countries in the world (169 out of 175 countries).
(1) 2000 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
ENVIRONNIENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT              GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASo



* 45.3% of the population falls below the national poverty line (30 cents per
day per capita), and 85% of the population lives below the internationally
recognised income poverty line (two dollars per day). (1)
* Life expectancy at birth is 44 years, and the illiteracy rate is at 75%. (2)
1.3          PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
1.3.1        Agro-climactic Zones
Burkina Faso can be divided into three major agro-ecological zones:
In the North is the Sahelian zone, with 350-500 mm rainfall per year. The
Sahelian zone is characterized by sand dunes interspersed with areas of
tiger bush and hardpan, and hills and low lying rocky ridges. There is a
predominance of steppe vegetation such as Acacia Senegal, Acacia nilotica,
Balanites aegyptica, Aristida spp, Cenchrus spp. The baobab (Adanosonia
digitata) is one of the most commonly found tall trees in the area.
* In the Centre is the Sudano-Sahelian zone (the Central Plateau, Central-
North, Central-East, and East), with 700-800 mm rainfall per year, with
high variability across small distances. The Sudano-Sahelian region is
characterised by savannah. The most common species of tall trees are
Burtyrospermum parkii, Khaya senegalensis, Parkia biglobosa, Tamarindus
Cymbopogon and Loudetia. The most commonly found grasses are
Andropogon gayanus, Cymbopogon and Loudetia.
* In the West and South is the Sudanian zone, with 800-1,000 mm rainfall
per year. However, the Sahara desert is relentlessly moving south, and
drying the wooded savannah and its thin layer of cultivatable soil into
sun-blackened rock-hard lakenite. Here, the herbaceous layer is more
dense and forms a continuous covering.
1.3.2        Rivers and Plains
Three principal rivers run through the country: the Komoe (Comoe) River is in
the Southwest, which flows through C6te d' Ivoire to the Gulf of Guinea; in the
Centre are the Mouhon (Black Volta), Nazinon (Red Volta), and Nakambe (White
Volta) rivers, which join in Ghana to form the Volta; and in the Northeast are
several small tributaries of the Niger. High plains of about 1000 to 1300 feet
comprise the major part of the territory. The highest, Mount Tenakourou in the
West near the border with Mali, measures 2500 feet, followed by the peak of
Nahouri in the South.

1.3.3        Climate
The tropical weather in Burkina Faso is divided into two seasons: the dry season
from November to May (with a cool and dry period from November to February,
and hot weather from March to May), and the rainy season from June to October.
The average temperature is 600F (15oC) at night, and 85oF (300C) during the day,
except in the dry season when temperatures may rise to over lOOoF (38oC).
Annual rainfall is highly variable over space and time, and ranges from 40 inches
to 10 inches. For example, in the Sahelian region of Burkina Faso, it may rain very
hard for a short period of time on a household's one plot, but the second plot a
few meters away may not get a drop of rain.
1.3.4       Natural Resources
Natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, gold, antimony, copper,
nickel, bauxite, lead, phosphates, zinc, and silver.
1.4         SocIo-ECONoMIc ENVIRONMENT
1.4.1       Population and land use
There is an estimated population of 11.6 million people, with a growth rate of 3.2
per annum. Burkina Faso is one of the most populated states in western Africa,
with 41 inhabitants per sq km. About 55% of the entire population lives in rural
areas and the population distribution in Burkina Faso is uneven. The following is
the breakdown of population concentration according to three zones:
* The Sahelian Zone in the North is a traditional herding area, with a low
population density (10-12 person per sq. km). The Sahelian people are
increasingly moving to the West, South and East, due to increasing
desertification in the region. In the Sahelian Zone, the Fulani system
combines traditional herding with mixed farming. Here, some
households live like the Bwa-Dagari and others like the Mossi. For more
information on the ethnic tribes of this region, please refer to the text in
* The Sudano-Sahelian Zone in the Centre and East is the most densely
populated area (of around 40-50 person per sq.km). The Kadiogo
Province, in which the capital city Ouagadougou is located, has 156
inhabitants per sq mile, and has the largest population. Ouagadougou,
the capital city, counts some one million inhabitants. The second largest
province is Kouritenga province in the East, with 47.6 inhabitants per sq
mile. The Mossi system is prevalent in this zone, where households
occupy separate concessions scattered across the territory. Here there are
small pots (around the concession), village fields and beyond that, fallow
land or bush.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT               GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO



*  In the West, in the Sudanian Zone, the Bwa-Dagari system exists, in which
households are grouped together and form a village concession consisting
mainly of village fields and bush. It is sparsely populated and attracts
people from the other two areas seeking better farming and living
conditions. This is a cotton-growing region of Burkina Faso, with the most
fertile soil in the country.
1.4.2       The National Economy
GDP per capita was US $214 in 2001, and according to the Human Development
Index, Burkina Faso is among the ten least developed countries in the world (169
out of 175 countries). The economic performance has been steadily improving in
the past 10 years, with the GDP growth rate at 5.6% in average. Agriculture and
livestock account for 32% of GDP, 92% percent of labour force and 60% of exports.
Industry accounts for 27.8% of GDP and 3% of labour force and is largely based
on agriculture. Service contributes to 40.2% of GDP and 5% of labour force. The
following are the main economic indicators:
*  About 87% of the population of Burkina Faso are engaged in
subsistence agriculture and nomadic stock keeping. There are about
1.3 million farms, marked by low productivity.
*  A significant proportion of the male labour force migrates annually to
neighbouring countries, particularly to Ghana and C6te d' Ivoire, for
seasonal employment. Most workers are employed in the agriculture
sector in growing peanuts, shea nuts, cotton, millet, corn rice, sesame
sorghum and tending livestock.
*  The main industries in Burkina Faso are cotton lint, beverages,
agricultural processing, soap, cigarettes, textiles and gold.
*  Burkina Faso exports cotton, animal products and gold. The country
imports machinery, food products and petroleum.
* 220 million kWh (1996) of energy are produced in Burkina Faso using
fossil fuels and hydro-electric power. The potential exists, and projects
are underway, to increase the hydroelectric installed capacity of
Burkina Faso. Electricity is provided by the parastatal utility Societe
Nationale de l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ). However, most of
fuel (96%) in country is produced by burning wood.
*  The oil industry in Burkina Faso is one of the key elements in the
economy of the country since all petroleum products are imported in
their refined form. Burkina Faso has a fledgling mining industry.

phenomenon, accounting for 94% of the national figure in 1998. There is a high
percentage of inequity in Burkina Faso: 10% of the total population continue to
account for 70% of aggregate national income, suggesting that there is not trickle
down effect of transferring wealth to the poor. The poorest regions are the North,
the North-Centre, the North-west, the East-Centre, the North-Centre, and the
East. The following is the breakdown of poverty incidence and probability by
agro-cimactic zones:

The incidence of poverty is highest among food crop farmers (50-52%), followed
by cash crop farmers (42.4%), and unemployed persons (38.7%). The average
household size among the poor is 7.6 persons. The following is the poverty trend
by socio-economic groups:

1.4.4          Education
One of CBRDPs major goals is to increase literacy through alphabetisation
program under its Local Capacihy Building component. Literacy is a first
prerequisite for successful capacity building and local development. Burkina
(1) Poverty line is expressed in terms of caloric intake at 2300/person/day, and CFAF 72,690 per adult per year.

Faso has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world at 18.5% (1998). The
following are major problems encountering the education sector:
*   Unit costs in primary education is high: 0.24 times per capita GDP as
compared with 0.15 times on average for the African country.
*   Dropout rates are higher in the North (10.9%) due to high mobility of
transhumant pastoralists, and lower in the Southwest (3.5%). Dropout
rates are higher among boys than girls (12.5% among boys and 7.1%
among girls in the North).
*   AIDS threatens the effectiveness of the system due to the increased rates
of teacher and student absenteeism, and the growing number of AIDS
orphans.
Rural women have the lowest literacy rate at 6.8%. Rural literacy rate is poor
overall at 10.8%. Establishment of mobile schools and teaching centres seem to be
effective mechanisms for combating illiteracy in rural areas. The following are
the education indicators among rural and urban populations, according to
gender:

1.4.5         Health
CBRDP identified HIV/AIDS as the major health problem in the country, and
aims to address HIV/ AIDS problems through its Local Capacity Building and
Local Investment Funds (LIF) components by conducting HIV/ AIDS training and
awareness increasing programs. The training will consist of providing
information on prevention, care and the identification of specific interventions

related to alleviation and prevention of the disease through local development
plans. (l)
Burkina Faso's population is growing at a rapid rate of 3.2% per annum, due to
the high fertility rate (6.8 births per woman). The health indicators are among the
poorest in Sub-Saharan Africa: life expectancy at birth is 54 years (as compared to
average of 52 for Africa), child mortality (2) is 219 (compared to 151), HIV
prevalence is 7% (African average at 8%), child malnutrition is at 32% (African
average at 24%), and maternal mortality is 484 per 100,000 live births.
Burkina Faso has the second highest HIV incidence among Western African
countries. The following is the breakdown of HIV/AIDS incidence according to
age groups:

HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, hepatitis A, meningitis, typhoid fever, yellow
fever, schistosomiasis and dengue are major diseases that contribute to mortality
in Burkina Faso.
1.4.6         Migration
Many Burkinabe are migrating within country from one region to another, or
from rural to urban areas. Also, there has been migration to other countries such
as C6te d'Ivoire and Ghana. However, in the last two years the trend has
reversed, and due to recent instability in Western Africa, migrants have been
returning to Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso has a very high percentage of migrant
child labour, either to urban areas or to other countries. An estimated 9.5%
(333,000) of children 9-17 years lived outside their homes, of which 29% (73,000)
lived abroad, mostly in C6te d'Ivoire. The main determinant for child labour
migration was the fact that the child never attended school. The highest shares of
international child labour migration were found in South-West, Centre-East and
East. (l)
The following are the types of migration that can be witnessed in Burkina Faso:
Box 1.1       Trends of migration in Burkina Faso
Rural to Urban Migration:
The migration of young people towards urban centres in search of work is
uncontrolled, and has lead to overpopulation in cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso. This has also lead to over-exploitation of land and deforestation around
large cities.
Migration to Other Countries:
Usually, rural males move mainly towards C6te d'Ivoire and to a lesser extent,
towards Ghana. This results in drainage of the workforce from rural areas.
Regional Migration:
This type of migration is characterized by migration from infertile, dry land and/or
overpopulated areas to regions that are under-populated and fertile. For example, in
last 20 years, there has been increasing migration from Northern, Eastern and Central
regions to Western and South-Western regions. This trend has increased since the
drought of 1970-72.

1.4.7          Administration in Burkina Faso
Burkina Faso is governed under the constitution of 1991. The president whom is
elected by popular vote for up to seven years heads the executive branch. The
bicameral legislature consists of a 111-member elected national assembly and a
120-member appointed chamber of representatives. The country is divided into
45 provinces.

1.4.8        Ethnic Groups and Religions
Of the 60 ethnic groups that populate the country, the Mossi (48.6%), Bissa,
Gourounsi and Gourmantche live in the central territories of the Sudano-Sahelian
zone; the Fulani (7.8%) in the Northern and Northeastern territories of the
Sahelian zone; the Dioula in the west, in the Sudanian zone. The linguistic groups
may likewise be divided into three: the Voltaic group, including the Mossi,
Dagari, Lobi, Gourmantche (7%), Gourounsi, and Senoufo; the Mand& group,
including the Dioula, Marka, Samo, Bobo, and Boussance; the Western Atlantic
group with the Fulani. While French is the official language, More, Dioula, and
Fulfulde are the main national languages. Though traditional religions are
practiced by 25.9% of the population, two other religious faiths are represented in
Burkina Faso: Islam represents 52% and Christianity 17.6%.

1.5          ACCESS TO ASSETS
1.5.1        Access to Land
Land tenure system is largely governed by traditional systems, in which the local
chiefs make decisions regarding plot distribution among village residents and
incoming migrants. In Burkina Faso, women do not have right to own land, but
have the right to plant seeds of their choice on plots allocated to them by
husbands, or males in the family. Their rights to cultivate plots increases with
their status, and usually, the elder women (or the first wives) have much more
weight in the decision-making process regarding plot tending. Allocation of
separate plots to women helps households to diversify their risks, and to ensure
provision of subsistence crops.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                   GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO



1.5.2        Access to Productive Capital, Employment and Financial Services
Rural people have the lowest access to capital and financial services. The
economy of the poor remains largely non-liquid due to the absence of banks
geared to their needs and the scant presence of micro-credit organizations.
1.5.3        Access to Potable Water
In 1998, 90% of households obtained their drinking water from wells, borehole
and public taps. There is a trend to an improvement in the quality of drinking
water, due to the national water supply policy. However, waterborne diseases
are prevalent in rural areas and contribute to the high mortality and morbidity
rates.
1.5.4        Access to Electricity
In rural Burkina Faso, less than one percent of households have access to
electricity. In the cities, 63% of households use kerosene lamps, and 37% has
access to electricity. Approximately 96% of household fuel comes from burning
wood.
1.6          LINKAGES BETWEEN LIVELIHOODS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
There are several key linkages between livelihoods and environmental resources,
which are relevant to rural areas in Burkina Faso. These are outlined below.
1.6.1        Exploitation of local vegetation
Logging
Wood is used for two main purposes: as a source of energy and as a building
material. Wood represented 96% of the domestic energy consumed in 1993. In
rural areas, the collection and sale of wood is particularly lucrative. When
assessing the damage presented by collection and cutting of wood, it is important
to assess whether villagers are collecting fallen dry woods, or are actively cutting
living trees. Also, it is important to assess the percentage of deforestation that is
contributed by commercial woodcutting. Deforestation rate is almost 2% per
annum. (l)
Bush fires
Fire is used for the following in Burkina Faso: (i) clearing the fields; (ii) hunting;
(iii) improving visibility; (iv) accelerating the re-growth of perennial grasses; and
(v) customary rituals. Fire impoverishes the soil and reduces its productivity,
(1) World Resources Institute: http://www.wri.org/wdces/bu9l1329.htrrI
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                   GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO



due to causing the loss of certain nutrients (nitrogen, sulphur), and organic
matter. More than 75% of fires occur between October and December. (1)
Unsustainable herding practices
Pastoralism in Burkina Faso is based on the intensive exploitation of natural
resources (grazing lands) without the use of agricultural and industrial by-
products. Herders cut brunches from the trees and bushes to feed their animals
during the dry seasons. Unsustainable practices of pastoralism contribute to
severe degradation of grazing land in the Centre, East and North. Also, herders
who settle on the edge of natural reserves (in the North) pose a great threat to the
forests and the preservation of their biodiversity. (2)
Unsustainable farming practices
Unsustainable farming in Burkina Faso contributes to soil degradation and
devegetation. In the cotton-producing regions of the west, overuse of fertilizers
and pesticides increasingly contribute to the loss of native vegetation. Also,
introduction of foreign species through farming contributes to the loss of
biodiversity.
1.6.2        Soil Erosion
Soil erosion due to water erosion can reach an average of 10 ha/year in the
Sahelian region. The short, heavy rains and the subsequent runoff are major
causes of soil erosion. As a result, the soil become sandy, and its water retention
capacity in decreased due to the loss of organic matter.
In the Sudanian-Sahelian region, soil is liable to crust formation, which produces
run-offs during heavy rainstorms. Run-off water washes away nutrients from the
soil.
In the Sudanian area, the Sahara desert is expanding into the region, and drying
the wooded savannah and its thin layer of cultivatable soil into sun-blackened
rock-hard lakenite. Here, the herbaceous layer is more dense and forms a
continuous covering.
1.6.3        Drought and Desertification
Drought is one of major causes for desertification. There has been a persistent
decline in rainfall since the 1960-70s. The average rainfall in Burkina Faso fell
from 450 mm to 300 mm in the North, and from 1,100 mm to 860 mm in the
South.

(2) Ibid, p.13
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENr                    GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO



There is growing evidence that changes in surface albedo and reduced
evapotranspiration (associated with devegetation) are instrumental in reducing
precipitation in areas. Devegetation has also resulted in reduced ground-water
recharge, increased soil-erosion and reduced soil fertility.
In the Sudano-Sahelian zone, there are 'cemeteries' of dead woodlands, with the
Sahelian species such as Acacia Senegal and Pterocarpu lucen colonizing the region.
Due to droughts, farmers have increasingly begun cultivating marginal areas and
muddy soils susceptible to erosion.
In the Sahelian zone, declining and less reliable rainfall, the result of climate
change and deforestation, is making rural life more difficult - pastures are
disappearing and land is becoming more unsuitable for farming. As a result of
the precarious livelihood, they lack food, water and income security. The
malnutrition rates of children in the Sahelian zone are among the highest in the
world.
1.7           BioDivERsITY IN BURKINA FASO
For the first phase (2003-2005), SILEM will support rehabilitation of degraded
lowland ecosystems for Burkina Faso's Northern provinces of Soum, Oudalan,
Seno, Yatenga, Loroum and Bam (100 villages) located in the Northern Sahelian
zone, covering 36 829 sq km (13.4% of the country), and 662,129 inhabitants.
For the second, third and fourth phases (2006-2015), SILEM intends to cover 600
lowland villages and rural communities living in micro-basins and watersheds.
SILEM's main project implementation areas are the following:
* Northern Sahel sylvo-pastoral and wildlife reserve;
* The protected natural habitats on the central Mossi plateau; and
* The protected natural habitats in the Eastern, Southern and Western
provinces.

1.7.1          National Parks in Burkina Faso
*   Foret Classee de la Mare aux Hippopotames
This reserve lies in Bobo-Dioulasso District in the West of the country,
80km north of the state of Bobo-Dioulasso (the second largest town in the
country). It is situated between the Black Volta River and the
Bossora/Bala highway. The marshy areas are to be found in the North,
and along the Black Volta and its tributaries. "Hippopotamus Pool" is the
southern part of the reserve has water all year round and covers some 660
ha. The forest is divided into two parts by the River Leyssa, which flows
west into the Black Volta. The Mare aux Hippopotames flows into the
Wolo River, a tributary of the Layessa which joins the Black Volta a
further 1 km downstream.
Vegetation generally comprises open forests, rich in species with Guinean
affinities, and gallery forests along the water courses. The most common
species are Anogeissus leiocarpus, Crataeva adansonii, Nauclea latifolia, Cola
cordifolia, Berlinia grandiflora, Detarium microcarpumn, Elaeis guineensis, Raphia
sudanica, Daniellia oliveri, Hyn2enocardia acida, Lannea velutina, Parinari

polyandra, Albizzia chevalieri and Pterocarpus erinaceus. In drier areas, forest
gives way to savannah, with Combretum spp., Isoberlinia doka and grasses,
such as Andropogon gayanus. Finally, there are the areas of aquatic
vegetation, and those frequently flooded. Floating vegetation in the lake
includes Pistia stratioides, Eischornia natans, and species of Azola, Neptunia
and Ipomea, while on the banks are dense thickets of species such as Ficus
congensis and Canthium correlia. Zones flooded from time to time include
species such as Mitragyna inermis and Crataeva religiosa.
Fauna: the most important large mammal is hippopotamus, of which
there were 39 in 1989. Numbers are higher during the wet season. The
fauna includes some 200 species, with diversity particularly high in the
lake area. Noteworthy groups are the ardeids, francolins and columbids.
Hippopotamus pool is an important breeding and nursery ground for fish
such as Tilapia.
Local people are Bobo, traditionally agriculturalists, together with some
Mossi migrants and Peul stock-raisers. There are five villages (Badema,
Bala, Bossora, Paramasso and Sokourani) in close proximity to the reserve
with some 22,000 inhabitants. Slash-and-bum agriculture is practised, the
main crops cultivated being Pennisetum americanum and Sorgum spp. At
Bala, the main activity in the dry season is fishing. Women collect fungi in
the wet season.
Management Constraints: in the South-west of the country, rice is
becoming an increasingly important crop and with it the demand for
suitable wetland. Thus, the status of the reserve as a protected area will
become more important.
* Les forets classees des Deux Bales
This reserve is located in the Central Western section of the country, in
Black Volta Province just west of the Black Volta River. The physical
feature entails an undulating granitic plain, broken up in places by rock
outcrops and lateritic plateaux.
Vegetation comprises Sudano-Zambezian savannah with a carpet of
grasses, and trees such as Anogeissus leiocarpus, Isoberlinia doka and
Terminalia laxiflora. There are gallery forests on the riverbanks.
Mammals include: hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius, buffalo
Syncerus caffer, elephant Loxodonta africana (T), crocodile Crocodylus sp. and
antelopes, although the diversity of fauna has been reported as being
reduced.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT                   GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO



Managetnent Constraints: poaching occurs, and in 1968 there was a
considerable reduction of large mammal populations by the "Service de
l'Elevage".
*  Parc national de Po
This national park is situated in the Central part of the country in
Ougadougou Province. Physical features consist of flood plains of alluvial
clays or alluvial sands and mud, which extend along both banks of the
Volta Rouge River are the dominant feature of the park. During the dry
season the river is reduced to isolated waterholes. In general, the area is
low-lying, apart for a few peaks of granite and laterite rising to 400 m.
Vegetation comprises Wooded savanna predominates, comprising:
Combretum lamprocarpum, Piliostigma thonningii, P. reticulatum,
Butyrospermurn paradoxum, Terminalia avicennioides, T. laxiflora, Detarium
microcarpum, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Combretum binderanum and Crossopteryx
febrifuga, with Mitragyna inermis restricted gallery forests on the banks of
the river. Isoberlinia doka and baobab Adansonia digitata are also present.
The herb layer is dominated by grasses, such as Andropogon ascinodis, A.
gayanus, Hyparrhenia glabriuscula, H. involucrata, H. rufa, H. smithiana, H.
subplumosa, Cymbopogon giganteus, Ctenium newtonii, Schoenefeldia gracilis,
Brachiaria jubata, Aristida kerstingii, Loudetia togoensis, Chrysochloa hindsii,
Sporobolusfestivus, S. pyramidalis, and Onjza longistaminata.
Fauna include lion Panthera leo, elephant Loxodonta africana (T), buffalo
Syncerus caffer, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, Bohor reedbuck Redunca
redunca, roan Hippotragus equinus, hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus,
common duiker Sylvicapra grimmia, red-flanked duiker Cephalophus
rufilatus, oribi Ourebia ourebi, bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus, warthog
Plhacochoerus aethiopicus, baboon Papio anubis, vervet monkey Cercopithecus
aethiops, and patas Enythrocebus patas. There are doubts as to whether all
these species still live in the park.
Managetnent constraints are as follows: all permanent ponds are utihised
continuously by local fishermen, thereby restricting wildlife access to
water. Poaching is the severest threat, especially to elephants, large
ungulates and cat species, which are killed to supply urban markets. It
has been partly checked in the eastern part of the park since the
introduction of vehicles and regular patrols, but much of the park is still
subject to incursions, both by traditional users of its products as well as
visitors from the towns and cities. At present, there are three operational
guard posts, but seven more need to be equipped to provide full
protection. Other threats include cattle grazing and woodcutting by local
people (especially during the dry season), land-clearance for agriculture
and the commercial collection of firewood.

and 275km Southwest of the city of Ougadougou, Southwest Burkina
Faso.
It consists of a freshwater lake and associated pools and marshes in the
floodplain of the Volta Noire river. During wet season floods, the river
and lake are linked. The vegetation of the area liable to inundation is
composed of truly aquatic species such as Pistia stratiotes, Eschornia natans,
Azola sp., Neptunia sp. and Ipomea sp.; dense thickets of Ficus congensis,
Canthium cornelia etc.; and herbaceous plants such as Vetiveria nigratana
and Hyparrhenia rufa. The site also includes well-developed gallery forest
(composed of Berlinia grandiflora, Vitex doniani etc.), dense dry forest, and
open dry forest/shrubby savannah. About 22,000 people live in six
villages in the surrounding areas. The site supports a rich mammal and
bird fauna. Mammals include ungulates, such as Alcelaphus buselaphus,

composed of shrubby and wooded savannah (e.g. Balanites aegyptiaca,
Entada africana, Vitellaria paradoxa etc.), with gallery forest of Ficus spp.
along the river. Human activities within the area include livestock rearing
and agriculture. The site supports a rich mammal fauna, including
ungulates such as Alcelaphus buselaphus, Tragelaphus scriptus, Kobus spp.,
Gazelle spp., Loxodonta africana, Hippopotamus amphibius, Syncerus coffer,
Hippotragus equinus and Damaliscus lunutas, as well as carnviores e.g.
Panthera pardus, P. leo, Acinonyx jubatus, Hyaena hyaena, Crocuta crocuta and

Lycaon pictus. Birds include Leptoptilos cruneniferus, Circus pjgargus,
Pluvianus aegyptius, Tringa glareola, Calidris minuta and Philomachus pugnax.
There is some poaching and encroachment of agriculture into the National
Park, which if uncontrolled, is likely to have serious impacts. A number of
management measures have been proposed, including the establishment
of a management body; in situ marking of the park boundaries; restoration
of pools; acquisition of logistical support; repair of access tracks; and
improved cooperation with the authorities in Niger and Benin.

1.7.3        Wildlife Reserves of Interestfor the Project
Wildlife Reserve of Arly:
The reserve is situated to the east of Pama in Fada n' Gourma Province, in
the South-east of the country on the international border with Benin. The
area is a flat lowland bordered on the South-east by the Pendjari River.
Some permanent ponds persist during the dry season. It mainly consists
of undifferentiated Soudanian woodland predominates.
Fauna: mammals in the area include: leopard Panthera pardus, lion P. leo,
side-striped jackal Canis adustus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, elephant
Loxodonta africana (T), hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius, buffalo
Syncerus caffer, waterbuck Kobus ellipsipnymnus, western kob K. kob,
bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus, oribi Ourebia ourebi, hartebeest Alcelaphus
buselaphus major, commnon duiker Sylvicapra grimmia, topi Damaliscus
lunatus, roan antelope Hippotragus equinus, warthog Phacochoerus
aethiopicus, patas monkey Enythrocebus patas, vervet monkey Cercopithecus
aethiops, and olive baboon Papio anubis.
Management Constraints: the reserve is divided into a total faunal
reserve, where human settlement and interference are prohibited and a
partial faunal reserve, administered as a hunting reserve. Poaching,
fishing and illicit removal of timber are the principal problems facing
reserve staff.
* Wildlife Reserve of Kourtiagou
This reserve is located in Fada n' Gourma Province in eastern Burkina
Faso, and covers 51,000 ha of land. It is adjacent to W National Park
complex.
Vegetation consists of wooded savannah, and mammals include spotted
hyena Crocuta crocuta, caracal Felis caracal, kob Kobus kob, Bohor reedbuck
Redunca redunca, oribi Ourebia ourebi, and bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus.
Management constraints: poaching, grazing and illicit timber extraction
present continuing problems.
*  Wildlife reserve of Pama
The total area is 223,500 ha. It is contiguous to Singou Total Faunal
Reserve (192,800 ha) and Arly Faunal Reserve. Vegetation is
predominantly a wooded savannah, and mammals include lion Panthera
leo, leopard P. pardus (rarely seen), olive baboon, Papio anubis, hares, and
genets.

* Wildlife reserve of Sahel
The reserve is located in Western Sahel, in the sub-prefecture of Dori. It
lies in a sandy zone, with both ancient and more recent dunes in the
northern part. Vegetation is a Sahelien bushland fauna includes gazelle
Gazella sp., ostrich Strutlzio camelus (uncommon), hares, francolin
Francolinus sp., and guinea fowl. The whole reserve is overgrazed and
there is much tree destruction by logging.
*  Wildlife reserve of Bontioli
The reserve is located in the West African Woodland/savannah, in Gaoua
Province in South-west Burkina Faso. The total area of the reserve is
12,700 ha.
Fauna Wildlife numbers have declined dramatically, with only very low
numbers of kob Kobus kob, roan Hippotragus equinus, and warthog
Phacochoerus aethiopicus. Elephant Loxodonta afnicana pass through the
reserves on their seasonal passage. The reserve is divided into a total
faunal reserve, where human settlement and interference are prohibited
and partial faunal reserve, administered as a hunting reserve.
Management constraints include poaching, cattle grazing and illicit
timber extraction continue to degrade the area.
