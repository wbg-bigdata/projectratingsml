3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
Background: Sierra Leone experienced a long period of economic decline starting from the early seventies.
This decline was mainly caused by external shocks and poor economic management. This resulted in the
near collapse of key public service institutions. As a result, implementation capacity in expenditure control,
budgeting, accounting and auditing remained very weak. To this end, the Government of Sierra Leone
(GoSL) in consultation with the World Bank launched the first Public Sector Management Support
(PSMS) Project. The first PSMS was to address capacity requirements in key government ministries,
departments with special emphasis on hose responsible for fiscal and financial management of the
economy. The objectives of the Project were to strengthen government's capacity to implement its
adjustment program, long-term growth strategy, and to focus on fiscal management. The Project also
intended to increase public service productivity by reforming the civil service, reducing Government's role
as owner and operator of public enterprises, support aid coordination, and setting up institutional structures
for the disbursement of donor program funds. The first PSMS Project provided support to many
Government agencies with special focus on fiscal management at the Ministry of Finance. It also supported
the creation of a Petroleum Unit that worked on the regulation of the petroleum industry. At the peak of
implementation of the Project in 1997, a total of 29 agencies were receiving support from the first PSMS
Project.

In May 1997 a military junta ousted the democratically elected government from power. On January 6,
1999 rebel forces attacked and overruned the nation's capital Freetown. The resultant unstable political and
security environment led to the abandoning of project activities, destruction of over 60% of equipment and
materials supplied to Project beneficiaries. When Project activities resumed later in 1999, the remaining
funds were used to provide limited support to the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Sierra Leone and thinly
spread to other beneficiary agencies.

GoSL therefore requested for the continued Bank's support in the following areas: (a) replacement of
equipment that was supplied but destroyed during the rebel invasion of Freetown; (b) completion of a
selected number of high priority activities that could not be completed under the first Project; (c) financing
of new high priority activities including the preparation of the country's PRSP. The issue of providing a
supplemental credit was considered but the preparation of a small new project was favored because of the
inclusion of new activities.

Relationship to the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS): The primary DO of the project is "to rebuild
and strengthen government structures to be more efficient in support of its economic recovery and
rehabilitation". The Development Objectives (DOs) of PSMS II and the proposed activities were consistent
with the Interim Support Strategy (1999) and the updated Transitional Support Strategy for Sierra Leone
that was approved by the Executive Directors in December 2000. In order to achieve this objective, the
project activities were to be concentrated on strengthening the key institutions and processes for economic
policy planning, formulation and implementation. This project was therefore supported by IDA to provide
the necessary support to the post conflict Government of Sierra Leone to rebuild its capacity.

The objective is sound and is based on the fact that after the long and protracted civil war in the country,
government structures were weak and needs rebuilding. The project objectives were relevant and consistent
with the post-conflict government's need to quickly build government's structure to rehabilitate the
economy. The project was therefore relevant in providing support to build government structures in its
attempt at recovery from the war.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The Project objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
(i) Strengthening the technical base for economic policy-making - $2,191,580.00
This component was to provide local and foreign technical assistance, training and some equipment to:
(a) strengthen fiscal and economic management in the Ministry of Finance;
Under this sub-component, the project supported the payment of fees to consultants to collect data. The
project also supported the recruitment of experts to be attached to the Ministry of Finance who were
involved in the provision of advice on effective budget management systems.

(b) strengthen the Economic Policy and Research Unit (EPRU);
It was envisaged that the project will provide funds to cover local consultancy fees and support staff
salaries of EPRU including the Director, Deputy Director and seven other staff for a period of one year
after the effectiveness of the credit.

(c) computerize the Bank of Sierra Leone;
Support under this sub-component was mainly supposed to upgrade the computer system and capacity in
the Bank of Sierra Leone to a modern system. Specific activities to be financed were: undertaking network
backbone cabling at the old office and the Sam Bangura building.; cabling of the Kenema Branch's offices;
acquisition of computers with network facilities; expansion of the network facility; the establishment and
maintenance of a website; establishment of a Computer Training Center and the upgrading of old
computers..

(d) reorganize the central Statistics Office (CSO); and
The project was to continue paying for the salary of the Chief Executive of the Central Statistics Office
who is required to restructure and reorganize the CSO. Support was also to be provided to undertake
studies that would enhance the capacity of CSO to compile high-quality statistics for economic policy
formulation and monitoring.

(e) strengthen the Office of the President of the Republic.
The focus of PSMS II project support under this sub-component was to strengthen the organizational
structure of the Office of the President; improve the level of coordination among various arms of the Office
and to improve the channels of communication between the Office, the public and the Public Service. To
this end, the following activities were to be funded: logistical support to the Office of the Secretary to the
President, consultancy fees and salary of the Presidential Spokesman and his secretary and the provision of
office supplies, consultancy fees for the National Security Adviser, one vehicle for the National Policy
Advisory Committee, a short term assessment of the needs of the overall Office of the President, payment
of consultancy fees for the head of the Oversight and Monitoring Unit and his assistants. At the Office of
the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, the project was to support the consultancy fess for six local
consultants and provide funds for training local staff and the provision of office equipment and supplies.

(f) Phasing out PSMS support to 29 beneficiary agencies.
This sub-component was to prepare the 29 agencies that received support from the first PSMS project to
phase out current assistance and help them to prepare to assume their responsibilities.

(ii) critical studies for economic policy-making - $868,448.00
(a)A comprehensive assessment of the functioning of the public sector, including the formulation of a
long-term strategy for public sector management and strengthening of economic and financial management;



                                                      - 3 -

The objective under this sub-component was to support GoSL to formulate a long-term strategy for public
sector management and for strengthening economic and financial management. A study was to be
conducted to provide a comprehensive assessment of the general functioning of the public sector (budget,
expenditure control, accounting, auditing, reporting, civil service, decision making processes, local
government).

(b) Economic policy-making studies including revenue generation and the design of an Independent
Revenue Authority, and the privatization of public enterprises;
The project was expected to fund some critical studies for economic policy making: review of the revenue
generation system and the formulation of an action plan; a strategy framework and implementation
arrangements for the privatization of public enterprises. With the approval by GoSL to establish an
Independent Revenue Authority, the project was to support the recruitment of an expert on revenue
management. The expert was expected to transform the existing Income Tax Department, The Customs and
Excise Department into an autonomous revenue agency. The expert was to produce a project document that
should include an organizational structure, staffing needs, core staff to be retained from the existing
revenue agencies, define the minimum physical resource requirements as well as the computerization
requirements, recommend conditions of service. The expert was also to identify internal sources of funding
to support the authority at the end of donor funding, identify and design training programs for staff and
advise on the enabling legislation required to maintain the independence of the authority.

(c) Reorganization of the Petroleum Unit to become self financed in one year
The objective under this sub-component was to review the mandate of the Petroleum Unit to turn it into a
self-financing unit within a year. The Petroleum Unit that was created in 1992 pursued the government
objective of guaranteeing pump prices that reflect international oil prices. Support for the Petroleum Unit
was provided by the first PSMS. Under PSMS II, support was to be provided to convert the unit into a
self-financing and autonomous unit with a year.

(d) Preparation of a PRSP.
The project was to finance two key advisory positions that are critical to the preparation of the National
Poverty Reduction Strategy. These are; a PRSP Technical Adviser to provide technical guidance to the
Minister of MODEP and the entire Ministry in the preparation of the PRSP and related planning activities
and a Management Information System Specialist, who was expected to design and guide the installation of
an information system that would meet the needs of MODEP for the formulation of PRSP and the needs of
information exchange with

(iii) HIV/AIDS Information, Education and Communication (IEC) - $40,000
This component was meant to support the government's campaign in the prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS by creating an increased public awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This component was
envisaged to complement activities under the Health Project (Cr. 2827 - SL).

(iv) Project Coordination $598,715.00
This component was to provide support for the government to coordinate project activities that include
amongst others regular preparation and submission of progress annual work plans, procurement plans,
financial management reports and project status reports. Under this component, provision was made for the
recruitment of a project advisor and an accounting and administrative officer who was to be responsible for
the financial management of the project. Support within this component was to also meant to be extended to
the Project Steering Committee to enable it function satisfactorily.

3.4 Revised Components:



3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry for the project is rated Satisfactory. Preparation of the project was based on work that
was undertaken during the earlier PSMS which closed on June 30, 2001. Preparation of the project begun
in 2000 when it became apparent that achievements under PSMS could not be consolidated due to the
unstable political and security conditions in the country. The government therefore requested from the Bank
additional resources for the completion of project activities. Based on this request, Bank staff fielded two
missions to meet with government officials to identify the scope and possible new areas for support.
Discussions were held with a wide range of stakeholders with the Ministry of Presidential affairs and the
Ministry of Finance in the lead. By the time the World Bank fielded an appraisal mission, two stakeholder
workshops were held to validate the scope of the project.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory. Economic and Fiscal management has improved.
Economic policies of the government now underpin annual budgets. As a result, budget management
has improved significantly. A more effective system for budget management is now in place through the
introduction of program-budgeting instead of line budgeting that existed prior to the project. GDP growth
rate increased from 5.4% in 2001 to 9.3% in 2003. Collection of revenue has improved. This is
evidenced by increments in rate of collection of Customs and excise duties and income tax (see
Annex 1 for further details).

4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1 Strengthening the Technical Base for Economic Policy Making: This component is rated
satisfactory based on the achievements of the five sub-components below:

4.2.1.1 Strengthening the Economic Policy and Research Unit (EPRU): This sub-component is rated
highly satisfactory. Consultants recruited through PSMS II in Ministry of Finance were instrumental in
improving fiscal management and improving the budgetary process. The consultants were the main
linchpins in the conduct and the preparation of reports on a series of Public Expenditure Tracking Survey.
The EPRU Consultants have been instrumental in the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) in the formulation of the national budget. The consultants also provided policy and
technical support on the design and implementation of other major government and donor-financed
programs and projects including those funded through the support of DFID and the European Commission.

4.2.1.2 Computerization of the Bank of Sierra Leone: Support under this sub-component is rate highly
satisfactory. Network cabling was successfully completed in the old office and the Sam Bangura Building.
A link was also established between the Head Office Buildings and the newly established Disaster
Recovery Site. A new banking software (the Bank Master) was procured and installed. In addition, the Sun
Computerized Accounting System was upgraded from a 12 user to a 16 user capacity. A modern training
center was established that continues to provide training to staff on computer skills. A website for the
central bank has been also developed (www.bankofsierraleone-centralbank.org).

4.2.1.3 Reorganization of the Central Statistics Office (CSO): This sub-component is rated highly
satisfactory. Support to the CSO was in the form of equipment and training of staff in computer skills,



                                                      - 5 -

survey sampling, data collection, database management, SPSS data analysis, census analysis, report
writing and others. The project also paid the salary of the Chief Executive Officer who led the restructuring
and reorganization of the of the CSO. As a first step, a new legislation (Statistics Act 2002) was prepared.
After Parliamentary approval of the new law, the name of CSO was changed to Statistics Sierra Leone
(SSL). A population legislation (Census Act 2002) was also approved in Parliament in September 2002.
From the financial year 2003, the operation of the SSL was changed to a grant institution. The entire
offices of SSL was refurbished. SSL has also set up six district offices. The following surveys and reports
were produced: Rapid Census of Schools in 2002; Census of Health Providers in 2002; the development
of a preliminary poverty profile, Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey.

SSL carried out preparatory activities in 2003 for the Population and Housing Census. The pilot census
was successfully undertaken in April 2003 and the result is available on the internet
(www.statistics-sierra-leone.org). Final preparations have been completed for a national census that is
slated for December 4-19, 2004. As a result of the efforts of SSL, Sierra Leone became the 58th member
to be uploaded onto the IMF's Dissemination Board following the finalization of the General Data
Dissemination Systems (GDDS) metadata in November 2003. A Strategic Master Plan for Statistics for
the period 2005-2009 was developed.

4.2.1.4 Strengthening the capacity of the Office of the President of the Republic: It was agreed that the
project will not finance several consultancies including the Presidential Spokesman and the National
Security Advisor. They were to be financed by other donors. The project supported (by paying salaries) the
following consultants: the Chairman of the National Policy Advisory Committee (NPAC), the Secretary to
the President, the Assistant to the Secretary to the President, three consultants in the Oversight &
Monitoring Unit (OMU). Logistical support was also provided to the Ministry of Presidential Affairs,
NPAC, Office of the National Security Advisor, Office of the Secretary to the President. NPAC regularly
provides policy advice to the President and screens all draft Cabinet Papers before there are sent to Cabinet
to ensure consistency with other policy documents and laws. The OMU that was created through support of
PSMS II was involved in monitoring the implementation of Cabinet decisions. The effect of the support for
National Security Advisor, Secretary to the President and the Assistant to the Secretary to the President
could not be evaluated since no report was ever submitted by their respective offices. The reasons given
were the sensitivity and security issues attached to their offices. As a result, this component is rated
marginally satisfactory.

4.2.1.5 Phasing out PSMS support to 29 beneficiary agencies: This sub-component is rated
unsatisfactory. At the end of the project, the total number of project beneficiary agencies were 22.
Logistical support, office equipment and stationery continued to be provided to those agencies. Support
was provided among others to the then Ministry of Public Affairs, the Office of the Attorney General and
Minister of Justice. Four lawyers were recruited as consultants to work on a backlog of overdue cases.

4.2.2 Critical Studies for Economic Policy-Making and Public Sector Management: This component is
rated satisfactory based on the achievement of the sub-components listed below.

4.2.2.1 A comprehensive assessment of the general functioning of the public sector: A comprehensive
assessment of the public service was not undertaken but several studies were undertaken that could serve as
building blocks for the comprehensive assessment. Some of the analytical work undertaken are: an
assessment of public financial management capacity ( in the areas of budget preparation, expenditure
control, accounting, auditing, reporting, procurement); functional reviews of four ministries (MoEST,
MoHS, MLGCD, MAFFS); a Corruption and Governance Survey and others. The Bank with government

involvement prepared an assessment report on the public sector titled "Strategic Options for Public Sector
Reform In Sierra Leone". Government also prepared a new decentralization policy and strategy in 2003.
Subsequently, a new Local Government Act was enacted by Parliament in February 2004. This has
provided for an ambitious agenda of devolution of responsibilities, functions, and resources to local
councils. A new Civil Service Code of Ethics was developed. A Presidential Commission was set up to
study the feasibility of creating a Senior Executive Service with the objective of ensuring that Government
is able to obtain and retain the services of high-level managerial staff has presented its final report. It is
important to note that all of the studies, reviews and surveys were not initiatives supported and funded by
PSMS II. As a result. this component is rated unsatisfactory.

4.2.2.2 Critical studies on revenue generation and privatization of public enterprises: This
sub-component is rated satisfactory. PSMS II financed a study on the formulation of an independent
revenue authority. The report of the study guided the preparation of the National Revenue Authority Act
that was approved by Parliament in Oct 2002. The project initiated a second study titled " Development of
Human Resources and Financial Management Systems for Enhanced Revenue Mobilization". This study
was later funded by DFID. Subsequently, allocated funds for this study was used to procure a four-wheel
vehicle to enhance monitoring of the new establishment. The NRA commenced operations in March 2003.
It absorbed the Income Tax and Customs Departments, which were originally part of the Ministry of
Finance, reduced the original staff by one third, and offered the remaining staff better incentives and career
advancement. Before the establishment of the NRA, the two main sources of domestic revenue in Sierra
Leone, customs and excise duties and income tax, accounted for 8% of GDP. This figure is less than half
of comparable levels in neighboring countries. As at the end of November 2003, with only a year in
existence, contribution of Income Tax Department and Customs and Excise Department to the GDP has
increased to 14.2% in FY 2003. It is forecasted to increase to 14.9% in FY2004, 15.8% in FY2005, and
16.2% in FY2006. Corporate tax is projected to increase by 33% by 2005, and individual income tax is
forecasted to rise by 10% during the same period.

4.2.2.3 Reorganization of the Petroleum Unit: This sub-component is rated highly satisfactory. The
objective of having a guarantees of pump prices reflecting international process has been achieved. The
Petroleum Unit has assisted GOSL to liberalized the petroleum industry and relinquished the responsibility
of supply and pricing mechanism to marketing companies in line with current views of best practice.
Support from PSMS II to the PU was in the form of salaries for the Director and Deputy Director. The
Petroleum Unit has proved useful over the years as it has stabilized petroleum prices and petroleum
products are freely available on the open market as a result of timely importation. The petroleum industry
is now a net contributor of revenue to the Government. To make the unit self-financing, the government has
issued a Cabinet Conclusion that authorized the collection of 15 Leones on every gallon (4.5 litres) of
petrol, gasoline and kerosene sold to the public. This tax element is now utilized to finance the activities of
the Unit.

4.2.2.4 Formulation and Initiation of a National Poverty Reduction Strategy : This sub-component is
rated marginally satisfactory. Support in this area entails the setting up of a secretariat in the Ministry of
Development to coordinate the preparation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Sierra
Leone. At the time of preparing this report, a draft PRSP was produced and circulated widely for
comments. It is expected that the final PRSP would be delivered by the end of December 2004.

4.2.2.5 Support the National Social Security Trust: This sub-component is rated highly satisfactory.
Funding for an expatriate Director General in the form of salary was provided till December 2003. An
actuarial report has been prepared whilst the core staff have been recruited and are at post. A computerized
system that is used to register employers and contributors has been installed and is operational. The


                                                      - 7 -

Director General developed a corporate plan for 2003-2006. Two deputy Director Generals (in charge of
operations and administration respectively) are at post whilst an indigenous counterpart Director General
was appointed to understudy the expatriate Director General and to eventually take over as the Director
General.

4.2.3 HIV/AIDS Information, Education and Communication:
This component was cancelled less than one year after the credit was declared effective. As a result, it is
not rated.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Institutional development impact is rated as substantial. Through the project, some new institutions
were established to strengthen public expenditure management. Notable among them are the National
Revenue Authority, the Petroleum Unit and NASSIT. Other institutions such as Statistics Sierra Leone
have been reorganized and strengthened. In the Ministry of Finance, the concept of Poverty Expenditure
Tracking Surveys (PETS) has been instittutionalized through the services of the consultants at EPRU.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
One major factor that affected the early preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was the
choice of the institutional home for the preparation process. Whilst there was no immediate capacity in
MODEP to lead the process, some development partners were insisting that the preparation process be led
by MODEP. The delay in choosing MODEP resulted in a significant delay in the PRSP preparation
process. What even compounded this issue was the institutional rivalry between MODEP and the Ministry
of Finance.

Another factor that is outside the control of the PIU is lack of leadership in the Human Resource
Management (HRM) reform. None of the government agencies (The Public Services Commission, the
Establishment Secretaries Office and the Office of the Cabinet Secretary) involved in HRM in the public
service took the lead to prepare a terms of reference for the development of the HRM strategy. When
studies such as the Pay and Grading Study were commissioned and the HRM agencies were involved right
from the beginning, implementation of the recommendations was a problem as it was not clear which
agency was going to lead on this.

The weakened civil/public service due to the long protracted civil war was a major factor that made most of
the beneficiary agencies to continue requesting for support from PSMS II. This situation was worsened by
the poor financial standing of government. Subsequently, most agencies legitimately continued lobbying for
support from the proceeds of the credit.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Ministry of Presidential Affairs that was the executing agency did not have a substantive Minister
during the last one year of the project. The Minister who was a member of the project Steering Committee
and was therefore a major link between the implementing agency and the executive was absent for almost a
year when decisive actions could have been taken on which HRM agency should lead on the development of



                                                     - 8 -

the public sector reform strategy.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Not applicable

5.4 Costs and financing:
The total estimated cost of the project was US $3.5 million financed through IDA credit and an additional
local currency equivalent of US $0.2 million to be provided through GoSL resources to be disbursed for a
period of two years and three months. At the end of the project (June 31, 2004) which lasted for 2 years
and 9 months, a total of US $3.258 million local currency equivalent was utilized from the IDA credit
indicating a disbursement rate of 88.54%. GoSL provided US $0.11 million which is 55% of its expected
contribution.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
During the design of the project, both the Bank and the government team agreed that the project which is
small and with a short life span was an interim measure to meet emergency needs. It was also understood
by the two parties that this project would pave the way for a larger capacity building operation to be funded
by the Bank as soon as a strategy on public sector reform is developed. A wider capacity building operation
(Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project) was effective in July 2004 in support of two elements
(decentralization strategy and PFM strategy) of the broad public sector reform strategy that were
developed.

Through project activities, some institutions were created and are currently operating on their own. These
institutions are the Petroleum Unit, NASSIT, and the NRA. Statistics Sierra Leone was reorganized
through project activities and is operating very well. All the above mentioned institutions are operating in a
systematic and sustainable way.

All the consultants who were recruited especially in the Ministry of Finance to provide support in economic
policy making performed well. As a result of their performance, DFID has agreed to provide funding
support to the consultants in the Ministry of Finance.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
For institutions like the NRA, the Petroleum Unit and NASSIT, very clear arrangements were put in place
at the end of the project and the three institutions are already on regular operations. SSL is also undertaking
activities as part of its regular operations after the reorganization and restructuring. In the case of the
Ministry of Finance, the Government of Sierra Leone secured a grant from DFID to pay for the of the
consultants who are providing services in economic management.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance at lending is rated satisfactory. This is because the design was simple and the entire
preparation till appraisal was done with full participation of government officials. The design was
consistent with the Interim Transitional Support Strategy. A Quality Enhancement Review of the project
was undertaken.

7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. Supervision of the project was moved to the field as soon as the Country Manager of the


                                                        - 9 -

Bank was relocated to the field and became the task team leader. Supervision was almost on a weekly basis
and focused on fiduciary aspects of project management. Implementation support was also provided to the
project management team. The average period of response to requests for no-objections and review of terms
of references was five working days. A Mid-Term review was conducted during which some
implementation issues were addressed. With the resignation of the Country Manager from the Bank in July
2003, a new TTL was designated by management of the Bank to manage the project and provide
implementation support to the project management team. The transition from one TTL to the other did not
affect the implementation of the project as the new TTL was in constant touch with the project team.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall performance of the Bank is rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The performance of the Government of Sierra Leone is rated satisfactory. This is because the government
team actively participated in the preparation of the project. The specific areas of support were identified by
the government team who demonstrated a high level of commitment to the project by cooperating with the
Bank team during preparation.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory. As agreed in the project documents, the
Government constituted a high powered Project Steering Committee (SC) that effectively provided
guidance to the project management team. The SC was involved in approving the work plans or asked for
their revision when necessary. The SC in some instances intervened when some beneficiary agencies were
not making attempts to use the project funds allocated to them after repeated reminders by the PIU. The
Government was unable to provide all the counterpart funds negotiated and agreed upon with the Bank.
However, this did not affect implementation of the project.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the Project Implementation Unit is rated satisfactory. This is because project
management was good. Work plans were prepared annually as a guide in the implementation of the project.
Periodic procurement plans were also prepared and revised quarterly to reflect changes in the work plans.
As agreed upon in the Development Credit Agreement, project management reports were prepared
annually that indicated progress and outstanding issues. Procurement management was good as all the
procurement that were undertaken followed the procurement procedures outlined in the project documents.
With regards to financial management, adequate financial records were maintained and annual external
audits were commissioned on time and the reports delivered to the Bank within the stipulated six months
after the preceding financial year.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Based on the above ratings, the overall performance of the Government is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

1. When project components reflect the highest priorities of a Government, implementation is easier and
faster as ownership is assured at all levels.

2. In a country with weak capacity in the public service, it is important that the design of projects are kept
simple with well defined components.




                                                     - 10 -

3. Thirdly, in a post conflict country where capacity is very weak, it is essential to provide a short term
capacity building support whilst a a long term strategy is developed build institutional capacity.

4. In a post conflict country, a clear and well defined transition arrangement needs to be made to ensure
sustainability of projects. The public service currently is not attracting young and talented graduates due to
the low remuneration. It is therefore necessary to devise a capacity building program through a sustainable
HRM strategy. The core of that strategy could focus on how to attract competences into the public service.
This requires a coherent and consistent support from the government and all development partners to the
development of a pay reform strategy.

final disbursement data is provided in Annex 3.I. Status Assessment of Project
Implementation Progress of PSMS II

The Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) through the PSMS II Project Implementation Unit, in
compiling the Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the project implementation status and
assesses the achievement of the development objectives against the following key indicators:

1)      improvement economic and fiscal management,
2)      improvement in revenue collection;
3)      better economic and social development statistics produced by SSL;
4)      improved implementation of Cabinet decisions;
5)      comprehensive public sector reform strategy;
6)      a high-quality Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP);
7)      the creation in the public of an awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The achievement of indicators 1-4 and 6 has been positive. Progress has been made on indicators
5. The draft PRSP has been completed. Indicator 7 was later abandoned when Component 3 was
removed form the Project.

The Performance Monitoring Matrix in Annex 1 includes detailed assessment and comments on
each indicator.

1.      Economic and fiscal management

Economic and fiscal management has been satisfactory. Consultants financed by PSMS II in
Ministry of Finance have been responsible for this achievement, evidenced by the completion of
the last three Reviews of the PRGF Arrangement, approved by the Board of the IMF on March
29, 2002, September 18, 2002, and April 21, 2003, respectively.

2.      Revenue collection

So far PSMS II has contributed to the successful establishment of an autonomous National
Revenue Authority (NRA), which, in its first two years of operation, already achieved
improvement in revenue collection. Before the establishment of the NRA, the two main sources of
domestic revenue in Sierra Leone, customs and excise duties and income tax, accounted for 8% of
GDP. This figure is less than half of comparable levels in neighbouring countries. As at the end of
November 2003, contribution of Income Tax Department and Customs and Excise Department to
the GDP increased to 14.2% in FY 2003. It is forecasted to increase to 14.9% in FY2004, 15.8%
in FY2005, and 16.2% in FY2006. Corporate tax is projected to increase by 33% by 2005, and
individual income tax is forecasted to rise by 10% during the same period.

3.      Economic and social development statistics by SSL

Physical refurbishment and organizational restructuring and capacity building of the SSL during
the past two years has significantly improved the status of the establishment and increased



                                                - 25 -

confidence in its products. The SSL has successfully undertaken surveys and produced reports.
Recent reports include: 1) Rapid Census of Schools in 2002; 2) Census of Health Service
Providers in 2002; 3) Inventory of Health Facilities in Four Districts in 2002; 4) Re-integration
Assistance to Ex-Combatants by NCDDR in 2002; 5) Status of War affected Children in 2002; 6)
Status of MDGs. The SSL has also undertaken the following activities:

       Finalization of the census questionnaire and enumerators' manual for the national census;
       The setting up of a National Census Advisory Committee;
       Completion of the Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey, with editing currently
ongoing; and
       The development of a preliminary poverty profile.
       The development of a Strategic Master Plan for Statistics for the period 2005-2009.

As a result of the efforts by SSL, in May 2003, Sierra Leone became the 58th member to
complete the General Data Dissemination Systems (GDDS) metadata, which was uploaded onto
the IMF's Dissemination Board.

4.      Improved implementation of Cabinet decisions


Under PSMS II, an Oversight and Monitoring Unit has been created in the Cabinet Secretariat. It
is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of cabinet decisions. Analysis
carried out by the OMU, shows that from the first 22 Cabinet meetings of 2003, 46% of all
conclusions reached have been partially implemented and 26% of Cabinet conclusions have been
fully implemented. The OMU has also started undertaking field monitoring of Government
projects.

5.      A comprehensive public sector reform strategy

A comprehensive public sector reform strategy does not yet exist, although many pieces of
analytical work have been financed by other sources of funding and can provide input for this
strategy. For example, Government with donor support has undertaken assessment of public
financial management (PFM) capacity (budget, expenditure control, accounting, auditing,
reporting, procurement); functional reviews of four ministries (MEST, MoHS, MLGCD,
MAFFS); a Corruption and Governance Survey; and various other diagnostic works. A World
Bank team, with active participation of a government focus group, also prepared a study on
"Strategic Options for Public Sector Reform in Sierra Leone" to stimulate the dialogue.

6.      A high-quality PRSP

After initial slippage, the PRSP process is nearing its completion. This was achieved by the
relocation of the Poverty Alleviation Strategy Coordination Office (PASCO) from the Ministry of
Development and Economic Planning to the Vice President's Office. PASCO was reinforced by
the setting up of a special body to complete the PRSP. Some key members of this body were from
EPRU  funded by PSMS II. A draft PRSP has been circulated for comments and suggestions.
The final product is expected at the end of October 2004.

II. Sustainability of PSMS II

The PAD specifies: "Project sustainability will continue to depend on government
commitment, the calibre of the counterpart staff and the success of the training program.
The program of training and skills-transfer built into the project will continue to help
develop a durable local public sector capacity in those agencies responsible for managing
the economy and public resources".

The project was success in providing a pool of high calibre staff within the MoF, as evidenced by
the completion of the last three Reviews of the PRGF Arrangement, approved by the Board of the
IMF on March 29, 2002, September 18, 2002, and April 21, 2003, respectively. The technical
assistance in budgeting also attests to this commitment, with a more effective system for budget
management now in place. The shifting of the budget process from a line-item to a
program-budgeting basis is further evidence of the success of the project. This process has created
strong budget preparation and monitoring capacity in the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of
Finance and has strengthened budget preparation capacity in such line Ministries as Education,
Works, Health, and Agriculture. The timely release of Government's printed Budget Estimates
attests to the recent effectiveness of training and capacity building. However, at the closure of
PSMS II, the MoF was left with a mere shadow of the high calibre and well-trained staff.

In spite of emphasis placed on sustainability within PSMS II, GOSL was largely unprepared to
take up the fee payment of consultants supported by PSMS II, although they continued to
perform the same routine functions. Instead, government turned to another donor, DfID to take
up this responsibility. Given that there was no clear exit Government strategy out of the PSMS
and PSMS II loop, over 50 percent of the PSMS II-funded consultants in the MoF have picked up
jobs in other World Bank-funded projects, NASSIT and other institutions, including the UN and
ECOWAS, (See Annex 2). The fact that this many people are able to pick up jobs, almost with
ease, says a lot about the calibre of the contract staff supported under the Project. It should be
noted that during the period when the MoF staff were funded by PSMS II they benefited from a
lot of external training in the specific job areas.

On the whole, GOSL is only funding 16 percent of those beneficiaries that are still on the same
jobs they were supported for under PSMS II. Therefore the closure of PSMS II has left a vacuum
in capacity of the MoF.

Bank Performance

Lending
The performance of IDA in identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is rated
satisfactory given that project design was very simple, following the earlier project PSMS design.
The following should be borne in mind:

       There were no risks associated with the project implementation; and
       There was sufficient capacity within the PIU with respect to IDA's financial reporting



                                                  - 27 -

requirements.

Supervision
Overall project supervision is rated satisfactory, in spite of the lack of continuity in the Bank's
team. The various teams focused on development impact; the fiduciary aspects of
implementation, adequacy of IDA and Government of Sierra Leone inputs to implementation. The
supervision frequency was initially planned twice a year. But when the Country Manager became
the TTL, supervision was on a weekly basis. Most implementation issues were addressed at the
Mid-Term Review. The Implementation Progress and Development Objective of the project were
always rated satisfactory.

Overall Bank Performance
The Bank's performance overall was Satisfactory. The Bank recognized the need to make
changes in some components and took the initiative. As a result, funds were transferred from one
component to another. However, the Bank was slow in advising how the undisbursed, funds
could have been used to build capacity in some beneficiary agencies.

Borrower Performance

Preparation
The government's performance during preparation is rated Satisfactory. GOSL participated
proactively in all aspects of preparation, and produced the required documentation for appraisal
and approval in a timely manner.

Government Implementation Performance
Government's implementation performance is rated Partly Satisfactory. The assessment is based
on the fact that the GOSL set up the Steering Sub-committee that was very effective. It met on a
regular basis and provided an oversight role to the PIU. Potential confrontations on
implementation matters with the supervisory Ministry were handled adequately by the Committee.
The area where government's implementation performance is rated unsatisfactory is in the
provision of the counterpart funds. The Project Credit Agreement showed that GOSL was to
contribute US$200,000, but as shown in Annex 6, it contributed only US$110,069 or about 55
percent.

Implementation Agency Performance


The performance of the implementation agency is rated Satisfactory. The assessment is based on
the following considerations:

       88 percent of project funds have been disbursed, and have been used for intended
purposes;
       annual work plans, audits and periodic reports delivered generally according to
agreements;
       PIU team contributed to all supervisory missions; and
       Legal covenants have been largely respected.




                                                - 28 -

Overall borrower performance
Overall, the performance of the Borrower is rated Satisfactory. There was overall consistent
commitment to the project in spite of numerous personnel changes in Government. Although
Government took over the payment of only 16 percent of the beneficiaries, it has put in motion
the concept of Senior Executive Service, which if properly guided could attract members of those
special job families that are currently on contract assignments, while doing routine government
jobs.

Lessons Learned

       Government should have an exit strategy that is sustainable for capacity building projects
to succeed.
       Strong and consistent Government commitment and ownership is important for successful
project implementation.
       Quality-at-entry is essential in designing projects, the project ensured this.
       Not much attention was paid to monitoring.
