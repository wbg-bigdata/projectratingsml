FOURTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1330-AR)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for Loan 1330-AR
(US$115 million) which was approved in September 1976. The Loan Agreement
became effective in January 1977. The final closing date (December 1983) of
the Loan Agreement was two years after the original closing date (December
1981). SEGBA IV was completed about four and one-half years late due to
reduced investment expenditures required to take account of couaterpart
financing problems and lower-than-expected load growth.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR
to the Government, the Borrower and Executing Agency. The comments
received from the Secretary of Planning, expressing concurrence with the
findings of the completion report, are attached.

2/   Delayed project completion reflected the effects of redkced market growth and
problems of local-currency funding.
3/ Iower-than-expected return reflects effect of actual project costs, actual tariff
levels, and actual operating costs. If annual operating costs had amounted to only
3.52 of project costs, as e3pected at appraisal, the rate of return on the Project
would have approximated 17.02.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARGENTINA
SERVICIOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES (SEGBA)
FOURTH POWER PROJECT (SEGBA IV)
(LOAN 1330-AR)
Higlights
Loan 1330-AR (US$115 million) helped to finance expansion of
transmission and distributiou lines, substations, and studies of Servicios
Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA).
With the agreement of the Bank, SEGBA changed the scope of the
Project (SEGBA IV) somewhat to adjust to changes in market requirements
(Section 3.1). Because of lower-than-expected demand (Section 4.1), and also
because of the poor financial situation of SEGRA (Section 5.2), the Project
suffered a completion delay of four and one-half years. Nevertheless, the
project was successful in meeting its normal technical and physical
objectives of providing facilities to meet the growing electricity demand of
the greater Buenos Aires area.
As a result of the Government's failure to implement adequate tariff
inereases, SEGBA did not comply with its financial covenants; and its financial
performance was poor during 1976-1983. To obtain compliance and to restore the
finances of SEGBA and the sector,-the Bank engaged the Government in dialogue
to identify constructive solutions, including the f%.rmulation of new covenants.
In 1979, the original revenue covenant of the SEGBA IV Loan Agreement was
superceded by the revenue covenant for the Yacyreta Loan Agreement.
Immediately after approval (October 1979) of the new Loan Agreement, the
Government informed the Bank that, as part of its anti-inflation effort, the
Government would not introduce the newly covenanted tariff increases. In
response to non-compliance, the Bank deferred effectiveness of the Tacyreta
Loan Agreement, but continued 4isbursements from Loan 1330-ARL The Bank again
engaged the Government in dialogue, including warnings about the need for
tariff increases. In June 1981, the Bank and the Government agreed to an
amendment of the revenue covenant of the Yacyreta Loan Agreement, after which
the Bank declared the Loan Agreement to be effective.
In 1982-1983, a sequence of adverse events (economic and political)
overwhelmed the efforts of the Government to restore sector finances with the
result that SEGBA earned negative rates of return. As the Bank took into
consideration these adverse economic and political events and as the Bank
accorded a high priority to the settlement of a complex procurement dispute,
the resolution of which was considered sufficiently serious to appear to jeopar-
dize the Bank's continued iarticipation in the Yacyreta project, the Bank continued
to defer taking nece3sary actions to enforce compliance.
The actual internal rate of return was 5.2%, as compared with the
appraisal estimate of 21% (Section 7.3).
As 'expected at appraisal, the institutional performance of SEGBA
was good (Section 6.1).

FOURTH POWER PROJEaCT (tGBA IV)
(LOAN 1330-AR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       Bank Lending to the Sector
1.1.1     Since 1962, the Bank has made six loans amounting to US$617 million
to the Argentine Power Sector (Annex 1). The Bank made its first loan in
1962 to SEGBA to help finance the Costanera thermal power plant and
transmission and distribution systems serving the metropolitan area of Buenos
Aires (308-AR; US$95 milliou). In 1968-1969, the Bank made two additional
loans to SEGBA to help to finance the expansion of thermal generation as well
as the transmission and distribution system (525-AR for US$55 million and
644-AR for US$60 million); and one to Hidroelectrica Norpatagonica S.A.
(HIDRONOR) for the construction of the 1200 MW El Chocon hydroelectric power
plant (577-AR for US$82 million). Subsequent to a pause of eight years, the
Bank resumed lending in 1976 with T,oan 1330-AR for SEGBA's fourth power
project, which is the subject of this report. The Bank is currently
supporting the construction of the binational (Argentina-Paraguay) Yacyreta
hydroelectric power plant (Loan 1761-AR; US$210 million).
1.1.2     The projects of SEGBA helped to extend power supply to industry
which is heavily concentrated in the greater Buenos Aires area. In addition
to the normal technical and physical objectives of helping to meet
electricity demand (especially industrial demand), the objectives sought by
the Bank included sector institutional development and policy reforms through
improvements of the sector organization and management and through
improvements of the electricity tariff structures.
1.2       Sector Organization
1.2.1     The power sector, mostly owned by the Provincial and National
Governments, has a fragmented organization; and no centralized planning body
enforces least-cost investment decisions on a sector-wide basis. Currently,
the Ministry of Public Works and Services, through the Secretariat of Energy,
controls SEGBA, HIDRONOR, and Agua y Energia Electrica (AyEE). The
Secretariat also represents Argentina in the two binational entities, Entidad
Binacional Yacyreta (EBY) with Paraguay and Comision Tecnica Mixta de Salto
Grande (CTMSG) with Uruguay. The Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica
(CNEA) reports to the President of Argentina.
1.2.2     As a corporation owned by the Argentine Government, SEGBA is the
only distributor of electricity in the greater Buenos Aires area. In
November 1980, the Government purchased and transferred to SEGBA all the
assets of Compania Italo-Argentina de Electricidad, S.A. (CIAE) a pri7ate
company operating in Buenos Aires (with a concession area formerly
overlapping that of SEGBA). Bank staff considered the acquisition of CIAE by
SEGBA to be technically justified (to eliminate overlapsing of the two
systems), and to require no prior consultation with the Bank.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1       Project PreRaration and Definition
2.1.1     During the execution of SEGBA's third power project (Loau 644-AR),
Bank staff identified a transmission and distribution project requiring a
loan of US$40 million to be included in the lending program for FY 1973.  The
proposed project would be SEGBA's fourth power project (SEGBA IV). To define
the propnsed project, preparation and preappraisal missions visited Argentina
i.n November 1973, March 1974, and July 1974. The first of two appraisal
missions visited Argentina in September 1974.
2.1.2     The key issues raised in the first appraisal related to SEGBA's
financial condition. Under the three earlier loan agreements, SEGBA had
failed to comply with financial covenants because of delayed tariff increases
and an undervalued rate base. To address these problems, in the course of
negotiations (April/May 1975) for a proposed loan of US$115 million,
representatives of the Bank, SEGBA, and the Government reached agreement on
the following issues:
(i)   tariff increases for reaching and maintaining a.. 8X rate of return
on net assets, with automatic adjustments to reflect changes in
costs and currency devaluations;
(ii) revaluation of SEGBA's assets; and
(iii) attaining at least a minimum debt service coverage of  1.1 times
for the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.
2.1.3     Because of adverse developments affecting the Argentine economy,
Bank staff deferred presenting the negotiated loan to the Board in 1975, as
originally expected. On August 4, 1975, the Bank informed the new Minister
of Economy that major new Bank commitments to Argentina would be contingent
upon economic performance. Before proceeding further with the proposed loan,
the Bank informed SEGBA that the Bank would:
(i) carry out a fresh review of: general economic and financial
*         conditions;      prospects for management of external debt and
balance of payments; and associated Government policies; and
(ii) appraise for a second time the Project within tne context of
SEGBA's expected investment and financial programs.
2.1.4     After a change of government administration (March 24, 1976), the
introduction of drastic measures to strengthen the country's foreign exchange
position, and the successful negotiation of a stand-by credit with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), a second appraisal mission visited SBGBA
in June/July 1976. Annex 2 sets forth the definition of the Project
(including studies) as agreed finally with SEGBA (para. 2.1.5). By



3-
subsequently processing the loan rapidly, the Bank provided timely assistance
to Argentina In connection with the efforts of the Government to obtain
financial assistance from other sources. This timely assistance was made
possible by simplifying procedures and by the efforts of Bank staff.
2.1.5     Based on the documents negotiated in April/May 1975 (the date of
the first negotiations) representatives of the Bank, the Government and
SEGBA successfully completed new negotiations for a loan amounting to
US$115.0 million between August 16 and 20, 1976.  Board presentation occurred
on September 21, 1976 and loan signing occurred on November 1, 1976. The
term of the Loan Agreement for Loan 1330-AR was 15 years, including three
years of grace; the rate of interest was 8.9% p.a. The Loan Agreement became
effective on November 1, 1976.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
3.1       Implementation of the Project, Changes, Delays
3.1.1     Details of mDdifications of physical Project components (lines,
substations, distribution facilities) are shown in Annex 3. Originally
planned and actual Project scope and completion dates are indicated with
reasons for specific deletions, additions and other changes. This
information reflects SEGBA's latest estimates for the components yet to be
completed, as SEGBA does not expect to complete the physical components until
the end of 1985.
3. .2     By mid-February 1977 the Government began to carry out the national
power expansion study and the Bank  began  to   review the bidding documents
for goods. However, SEGBA reported that the main works of the !roject would
suffer delays due to:
(a)  late passage of the Law No. 21.522 which established incentives for
local industries and special regulations for foreign bidders under
Bank financed procurement;
(b)  late approval of the national budget which assigned treasury
contributions to SEGBA;
(c)  lack of tariff increases as covenanted under the loan; and
(d)  labor problems which SEGBA faced in the first quarter of 1977.
Due to the above factors, SEGBA adjusted its 1977 construction program to
available resources. This adjustment was considered acceptable by the Bank.
3.1.3     Slowdown in load growth, late approvals of national budgets and
inadequate tariff increases frequently delayed Project execution throughout
the construction period; and led to annual adjustments of the priorities of
the program. The revisions to the Project were based on results of
periodically repeated system expansion studies which provided the
justification for the deletions, lpostponements, or advancements of lines and
substations shown in Annex 2. SEGBA informed the Bank of the changes through
its comprehensive quarterly construction reports and during Bank supervision
missions. Bank staff found the proposed changes to the Project to be
reasonable and appropriate to the circumstances.
3.1.4     Because of funding problems due to inadequate tariff levels, SEGBA
had to cut its total investment program for 1977 and 1978. The situation
improved temporarily during 1973 but deteriorated again from 1980 onward.
The supervision mission of February 1980 predicted that Project
implementation would have further delays if the Government continued its
policy of increasing tariffs at a rate lower than the inflation rate. The
March 1981 mission concluded that the major project components would not be
completed before mid-1983 due to the further tightening of SEGBA's financial



situation. As a result of the delays described above, the Bank agreed to
extend the loan closing date from December 31, 1981 to December 31, 1983.
Annex 4 compares actual and forecast schedules of disbursements.
3.1.6     In general, the performance of most of SEGBA's construction
contractors was satisfactory. However, the civil works contractor of an
important 500 kV substation defaulted and went bankrupt. Four new
contractors were engaged to complete the works, with SEGBA's own staff
carrying out the erection of the electromechanical equipment. SEGBA also
dismissed the contractor for the 220 kV Matheu-Empalme Tigre l$ne due to his
noncompliance with his contract.
3.1.7     By mid 1984 about 93% of the physical Project had been completed.
The last tenders for equipment and materials financed by the loan were
awarded during the second half of 1983. After the loan closing date,
December 3 ,1983, disbursements for some final payments continued until June
30, 1984. The slow rate for completing the remaining percentage of the
Project resulted from the lack of local funds for civil works and the slow
pace of erection carried out by local contractors or under force account.
Completion of the Abasto 500/220 kV substation will be delayed to the end
of 1985. However, late completion of this substation is not critical because
of the slow load growth in the southern SEGBA service area and the delay of
the completion of the line from the Alicura hydroelectric plant.
3.2       Implementation of Studies
3.2.1     The national power expansion program and the sector organization
study financed with the proceeds of Loan 1330-AR were carried out by the
Secretariat of Energy. Bank staff were satisfied with the performance of
consultants who carried out these studies. The studies were comprehensive
and well made.
3.2.2     The recommendations of the sector organization study were well
implemented by the Government, which took the following important steps:
(i) concentration of the planning and funding of the major generation
and bulk transmission works in the hands of the Secretariat of
Energy; and
(ii) transfer of the subtransmission and distribution networks of
AyEE to provincial distribution entities, leaving AyEE the
responsibility - together with HIDRONOR - of building and operating
generation and transmission works of national importance.
3.3       Project Costs
3.3.1     As set forth in Annex 5, the final Project cost, in current prices
and at the official exchange rates and excluding financial charges, amounted
to US$691.5 million, of which US$181.9 million were foreiga costs. This is
39.6% and 19.2%, respectively, above the appraisal estimates.



-6-
3.3.2     Based on peso amounts converted into US dollar equivalents, the
above project cost, US$691.5 million, reflects the distortions of the
official exchange rate, which for several years failed to reflect the proper
relationship between external and domestic rates of inflation. To remedy the
shortcomings of the official exchange rate relative to its purchasing power
parity, a private Argentine firm (Techint) developed a purchasing power
parity rate of exchange (PTE) which reflects a theoretical balance between
the external and domestic rates of inflation (see Annex 12, footnote d).
Based on the PTE, the project cost, in current prices, amounted to US$627.3
million, of which US$171.2 million were foreign costs, or 26.7% and 12.3%,
respectively, above appraisal estimates. In constant prices, the project
cost amounted to US$396.7 million, as compared with the appraisal cost
estimate of US$384.9 million. This calculation shows an increase of 4.3% for
local, 0.3% for foreign and 3.1% for total cost over appraisal estimates.
However, due to the changes to the scope of the project, very limited
conclusions may be extracted from these figures,



-7-
IV.  OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1       Demand
4.1.1     Due to the economic situation of Argentina during 1976-1983, the
demand for electricity grew significantly less than the appraisal forecast,
as shown in Annex 6. This slowdown in overall load growth required some
changes in the Project as mentioned in para. 3.1.3. The forecast sales
growth was 7.4% per year, but actual sales growth was 5.7X per year.
However, this "growth" includes the incorporation into the company's
operations of the CIAE in 1980, which represented about 15X of SEGBA's sales.
4.2       Losses
4.2.1     The energy losses were higher than those forecasted in the
appraisal, thereby producing a slower than forecasted increase of revenue.
As shown in Annex 7, the energy losses remained around 162 of total sales
until 1981; the appraisal was based on losses reducing from 162 in 1975 to
14.3% in 1981. From 1981, actual losses grew rapidly to about 22.52. The
increase is not in technical losses but in "unaccounted for energy" with
most of the increase due to fraudulent use. Early in 1984, SEGBA's
management set up a "Comision Contra Fraude' which is trying-out several
approaches to combat fraud. Initial results observed for May 1984, while
modest, show that SEGBA may be on the right track. If results continue to be
encouraging, other power systems may be able to learn from SEGBA's
experience.
4.3       Operating Costs
4.3.1     SEGBA made a significant effort to increase productivity by
confronting the strong labor union and seeking to eliminate featherbedding.
The number of employees declined from 24815 in 1976 to 20130 in 1983
(considering the 2937 employees of CIAE incorporated in 1980) (See Annex 7).
This reduction mainly affected operational personnel (22X reduction) and
administrative personnel (25% reduction). The results of this personnel
reduction program were better than appraisal expectations. However, this
effort had only a small effect on SEGBA's financial situation.
4.3.2     Nevertheless, SEGBA's operating costs per kWh sold (excluding
depreciation) increased 47% in constant 1976 prices from about UScents 3.00
in 1976 to UScents 4.4 in 1983 (see table below), mainly due to the increase
of cost of purchased power.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1       Actual and Appraisal Forecast Financial Data
5.1.1     Annexes 8, 9, and 10 compare actual and appraisal forecast
financial data for the years 1976-1983. The appraisal figures were presented
in millions of current US dollars; the actual figures were converted Into
current US dollars using a purchasing power parity rate of exchange (PTE)
(para. 3.3.2). The PTE was felt to provide a more meaningful comparison than
the official exchange rate, which for several years lagged significantly
behind internal inflation and then was drastically devalued (Annex 11).
5.1.2     SEGBA's financial performance was poor due to inadequate tariff
increases. Its financial problems were further complicated by
disproportionate resort to short-term debt and high levels of overdue
accounts receivable. The following paragraphs discuss these factors.
5.2      Tariff Increases and Compliance with Revenue Covenants
5.2.1     During the period 1976-1983, the Government, by not authorizing
adequate power tariff increases, did not comply with the revenue covenants of
the SEGBA IV Guarantee Agreement and with subsequent and superceding revenue
covenants agreed with the Bank in connection with the Yacyreta hydroelectric
project (Loan 1761-AR). As a result of non-compliance on the part of the
Government, SEGBA did not comply with its corresponding covenants; and its
financial performance was poor: the rate of return (ROR) of SEGBA was
negative in 1976, 1979, 1982, 1983, and 1984; and SEGBA never did earn the
ROR covenanted in the SEGBA IV Loan Agreement -- 8%.
5.2.2     Rather than apply harsh remedies to enforce compliance, the Bank
tried to be accommodating by engaging the Government in dialogue with respect
to the formulation of constructive measures which would promote adequate
tariff levels for the sector and SEGBA. This approach reflected an
understanding attitude toward the succession of economic and political
problems which buffeted the Government during the period 1976-1983. From
1979 onward, it also reflected the Bank's involvement with the Yacyreta
hydroelectric project.
5.2,3     Within a few months of effectiveness of the SEGBA IV Loan Agreement
(January 10, 1977) and throughout 1977, the Government and the management of
the Bank discussed, in order to help the Government's anti-inflationary
measures, a relaxation of the requirements for power sector tariff
increases. By October 1977, an agreement was reached on a new timetable and
mechanisms (e.g., revaluation of assets) for tariff adjustment and recovery
of sector revenue shortfalls. The seriousness of the Government's commitment
to this agreement was highlighted by the implementation of a nominal tariff
increase of 59% at the end of December 1977. Nevertheless, SEGBA's ROR in
1978 was only 7.2%, not the covenanted return of 8%.
5.2.4     In 1979, in connection with the Yacyreta hydroelectric project, the
Bank attempted, inter alia, to strengthen sector finances in general and



- 10 -
those of SEGBA in parriaular.  The revenue covenant of the Yacyreta Loan
Agreement superceded chat of the SEGBA IV Loan Agreement; and committed the
Government to increase by January 1, 1980, the level of SEGBA tariffs in real
terms to the level prevailing as of January 1, 1979, to maintain that
approximate level until December 1981, and to set tariff levels thereafter at
levels sufficient to earn 8% annually on revalued assets.
5.2.5     Shortly after Bank approval (October 16, 1979) of the Yacyreta Loan
Agreement, the Government informed the Bank that, as part of its
anti-inflation effort, there would not be tariff increases sufficient to com-
ply with the new revenue covenants. In response to non-compliance, the
Bank postponed effectiveness of the Yacyreta Loan Agreement but continued to
disburse the proceeds of Loan 1330-AR. During the next two years, the Bank
engaged the Government in dialogue concerning constructive measures, coupled
with strong warnings as to the willingness of the Bank to continue its
participation in the sector and the need to raise tariff levels.
5.2.5     This approach remained in effect during 1980 and early 1981 while
the Government took corrective action in the form of tariff increases, tax
modifications, and debt restructuring to benefit the power sector. Based on
these measures, and in response to the request of the Government, the Bank
agreed (June 1981) to amend the Yacyreta revenue covenants. Under the
amended covenant, the Government agreed to raise tariffs by 6.3% in real
terms no later than December 31, 1981 over the level prevailing on April 30,
1981 and to maintain them thereafter at that level in real terms.  Further,
the Government agreed to (and later implemented) electricity rates for SEGBA
reflecting average long run marginal costs of electricity supply.  In
consequence of the amended revenue covenant, the Bank declared the Yacyreta
Loan Agreement to be effective.
5.2.6     This serious effort of the Bank and the Government to restore
sector finances (and those of SEGBA) was later overwhelmed by a succession of
adverse political and economic events. In consequence of these events,
subsequent compliance by the Government with the amended revenue covenant was
unsatisfactory, as SEXiBA earned negative rates of return in 1982, 1983, and
1984. The Bank contiiiued to defer taking nece*sary actions to enforce
compliance, giving priority to the settlement of a ccmplex procurement
dispute, the resolution of which was considered sufficiently serious to
appear to jeopardize the Bank's continued participation in the Yacyreta
project.
5.3       Government Contribution and Debt-service_-erae
5.3.1     Under the Guarantee Agreement, the Government agreed to provide
SEGBA with US$50.3 million in 1976 and US$36b.5 million in 1977 to offset the
total shortfall in earnings with respect to its covenanted 8% ROR. This
covenant supplemented existing obligations under the concession agreementl/.
1/ The concession agreement requires the government to pay the ROR make-up
(Defecto de beneticio) which is the difference between actual earnings and
the earnings required to obtain 8% of IROR,



- 11 -
Actual contributions fell short of those amounts (US$11 million in 1976 and
US$31 milion in 1977). During the period between 1978 and 1981, the
Government complicated the financial problems of SEGBA by ceasing to make
further contributions and by imposing special taxes on SEGBA.  These taxes
increased three times in real terms during 1977-1983 (using the Argentine
consumer price index as deflator). The Government's contribution was
reestablished in 1982 to cover SEGBA's operational deficit.
5.3.2     In a side letter to Loan 1330-AR, the Government agreed to the
recovery of SEGBA's past earnings shortfalls (with respect to the Concession
Agreement between 1977 and 1979) but this recovery was never carried out. In
1982, the Government paid SEGBA the accumulated ROR make-up for the first
time since 1970.  The whole amount was used to pay part of the short-term
loans accumulated during the period.
5.4       Short-term Debt  -
5.4.1     The deterioration of tariff and revenue levels produced a negative
self-financing ratie during all the period except in 1978. The difficulty of
financing its investment program forced SEGBA to make a disproportionate use
of local short-term loans. The composition of debt during the period is
shown below.

5.5       Accounts Receivable
5.5.1     As a consequence of the economic deterioration, the level of
accounts receivable increased sharply from 76 days in 1980 to 215 days in
1982 and 197 days in 1983, mainly due to arrears from the Government
agencies. The appraisal considered a value of 76 days as satisfactory.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCES
6.1       The Borrower
6.1.1     At the beginning of the period 1976-1983, SEGBA succeeded in
improving overall efficiency by reducing unnecessary staff, overtime, and
general expenses, and by increasing reliability through improved maintenance
of thermal generation equipment.
6.1.2     SEGBA did not successfully influence Government budgetary and
tariff decisions, which were mainly responsible for the delay in P-roject
completion (about 4-1/2 years). However, the distribution componenl' was
completed in 1982 with a delay of only one year (para. 3.1.1). The
installations, equipment and construction were of a high quality and
constituted a credit to the engineering and design capability of SEGBA
technical staff. SEGBA's execution was more than satisfactory under adverse
circumstances not of its own making.
6.2       The Government
6.2.1     While there were serious efforts to restore sector finances
in    1978 and 1981, the fact remains that the Government missed the
opportunity to authorize tariff increases sufficient for SEGBA to earn the 8%
rate of return stipulated in the Concession Agreement. In 1982 and 1983,
there were no such opportunities, as political and economic events ovrwhelmed
the Government. During this period, the execution of SEGBA IV was, along with
virtually every other project, severly affected by Government policy
reversals and "on-again, off-again' indecision as to the relative importance
of fiscal austerity and realistic pricing. No Argentine Government in these
years succeeded in maintaining sound public sector pricing policy in the
context of a declining economy and rising inflationo
6.3       The Bank
6.3.1     The Bank appraised the project as  a repeater' operation with a
sophisticated borrower. The Bank relied heavily on the analyses and
judgements of the borrower concerning its requirements, in view of the large
number and diversity of components making up the project and the satisfactory
experience with the borrower's previous projects. Indications are that all
components eventually installed were needed and applied correctly.
6.3.2     The Bank showed appropriate flexibility in agreeing to the changes
in physical component, scope, and timetables for installation dictated by the
changing pattern of load development and the financial constraints of the



- 13 -
chauging pattern of load develoiment and the financial constraints of the
borrower. Supervision of the administration of the many hundreds of
procurement items (not unusual for distribution projects) and the resolution
of the few procurement issues were carried out successfully. Spot visits
were made to project sites during supervision missions as inspection of items
actually procured and installed would have been impractical given their large
number and geographic dispersal.
6.3.3     The Bank's supervision of the studies by the Secretariat of Energy
allowed the Bank to maintain a dialogue on the content and findings of the
studies for power sector organization and national expansion program. In the
.later years of the implementation of the Project, this and SEGBA's su-
pervision were carried out in connection with, or part of, the preparation,
appraisal and supervision of the Yacyreta hydroelectric project (Loan
1761-AR).
6.3.4     In 1981, as part of making Loan 1761-AR effective, the Bank reached
agreements with the Government on the general policy for the development cf
the power sector. Whereas rational measures were taken to improve sector
organization by separating the responsibility for distribution from bulk
generation and transmission entities, the Government did not comply with the
aspects on sector finances of these agreements.
6.3.4     The financial deterioration of SEGBA was the subject of intensive
efforts and examination by Bank staff.
6.3.5     The Bank was flexible with regard to the problems of SEGBA's
financial performance, although without ultimate success. The Bank agreed to
several changes in the financial covenants (related to tariff increases),
waived compliance on several occasions, and allowed SEGBA to borrow from
commercial banks as required. It is an open question whether the Bank could
have achieved more than it attempted with respect to the financial situation
of SEGBA, given the macroeconomic policies of the Government. However,
before 1982, by engaging the Government in dialogue rather than taking harsh
measures to enforce the financial covenants, when there was clear indication
that the financial situation of the Borrower was deteriorating, the_Bank may
have lost credibility as to the importance it attached to this under-
standing. On sector grounds, it would now appear that a stronger Bank
stance would have been warranted. After 1982, economic and political events
overwhelmed the Government and Bank efforts to restore sector finances.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATIO'N
7.1       Appraisal Justification
7.1.1     The appraisal report justified the undertaking of the Project
because it would:
(i)  provide SEGBA with uransmission and diEtribution facilities to use
its share of remote hydropower (El Chocon, Planicie. Banderita and
Salto Grande) and the output of the nuclear power pla its. Energy
from these sources would allow SEGBA to meet increasing demand for
power as a result of-the expected revitalization of indu trial
activities (para.1.1.2). While most of industrial demand lagged
expectations, the distribution facilities under the project allowed
connection of at least the number of customers estimated at
appraisal.
(ii)  support the Bank's objective of improving sector organization,
planning, financing and operations (para. 1.1.2), to attain
maximum economy and efficiency in the power sector. This support
was provided through power sector organization study and by
tailoring the national power expansion to the least cost expansion
plan.
Except in the area of sector finances (para. 5.2.1 and 5.3.1), the above objec-
tives have been achieved, albeit with a substantial time overrun.(para. 3.1.4).
7.2       SEGBA Load Growth
7.2.1     The main objective to be achieved by the physical project
components was- to provide the transmission and distribution facilities needed
to supply the growing load in SEGBA's concession area. Sales to the
industrial sector were lower on average than forecast, the actual level of
energy losses was not reduced and, overall, the load grew slower than
predicted. However, the project components were added in a flexible and
timely fashion by adjusting the construction timetable to the changing
demand growth.
7.3       Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
7.3.1     The appralsal report indicated an IRR of 21Z on project
investment. Based on actual cost data for the Project, the IRR is estimated
at 5.2% (Annex 12). This value is based on actual results so far achieved
but with adjusted attributable fuel operating and maintenance costs and
revenues to reflect approximately economic values. An adjustment of fuel
costs to international prices was made because SEGBA obtains fuel at heavily
subsidized prices.

VIII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
8.1       Successful Project
8.1.1     The proceeds of tne loan were usefully invested and the physical
objectives reached, even though none of the financial objectives were
accomplished and SEGBA's financial position has seriously deteriorated over
the last few years   As a result of timely changes to the Project in response
to changing system requirements, SEGBA completed the project reasonably
within the original cost estimates.
8.2       Sector Financing
8.2.1     In the future, the sector's financial condition and outlook will
need to be followed closely and the agreements under the Yacyreta Loan
modified in line with the changes in sector expansion plans and the financial
conditions in the country. The Bank should take a hard look at its approach
to conditionality, and it would be proper to consider lowering the financial
targets but taking a stricter stance regarding compliance with the agreements
thereby reached.
