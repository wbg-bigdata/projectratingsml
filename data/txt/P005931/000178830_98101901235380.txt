APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH BUENOS AIRES POWER PROJECT
SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES (SEGBA)
ARGENTINA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project forming part of the
1977-1981 expansion program of Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires
(SEGBA), a corporation owned by the Argentine Government, which is the main
distributor of electricity in the Greater Buenos Aires area.
ii.       This would be the Bank's fourth loan to SEGBA.  The first three
loans, which were made in 1962, 1968 and 1969 helped finance the expansion
of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The physical
execution of these three projects has been satisfactory. Considerable
progress was made toward one of the long-term objectives of Bank lending
to SEGBA namely the building of SEGBA into a financially sound utility.
However, this achievement was nullified by Government interference in
1964 and 1971. SEGBA's finances deteriorated dramatically as a result of
it not being permitted to adjust its tariffs to keep pace with inflation
and devaluation as provided by its Concession Agreement. However, as a
result of monthly tariff increases which have been approved by the Government
since April 1976, SEGBA is expected to comply with its concession and make
a satisfactory contribution to the financing of its investment program in
1977 and thereafter.
iii.      The power sector, although essentially owned by the Government,
has a fragmented organization. No reasonable national expansion program
exists. As a result, a number of unjustified investment decisions for the sector
have been taken in the past. The present Government, aware of this situation,
intends to carry out a national sector organization study and prepare a national
power expansion plan and to discuss their conclusions with the Bank. A
rational development of the sector is of high priority to Argentina's industrial
development. Industry is the largest consumer of electricity and its
consumption has been growing rapidly.
iv.       The project consists of the main elements of SEGBA's 1977-1981
transmission and distribution program and two studies to be carried out by the
Government. It is estimated to cost US$495.3 million (equivalent), with a
foreign currency component of US$152.6 million, US$115 million of which would
be financed out of the proposed loan.  The Bank loan would be disbursed for
equipment purchased during the period 1977-1980 and would cover 13.9% of SEGBA's
financial requirements for this period. The balance of 1977-1980 requirements
would be met by internal cash generation (51.3%), Government contributions
(4.4%) and by foreign and local bank loans (30.4%). The project would allow
SEGBA to provide the power infrastructure needed to support   the continued
growth of industrv in its service area, Argentina's largest market for
electricity.
v.        Procurement procedures would be substantially similar to those
established for the previous loan to SEGBA. Contracts for equipment and
materials to be financed out of the Bank loan will be awarded after international



- ii -
competitive bidding. Argentine manufacturers will be granted a margin
of preference of 15% over the CIF price of the lowest qualified foreign
biddc , or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. In
addition,some of the equipment and materials needed by SEGBA may be
procured locally without international competitive bidding and with financing
from sources other than the Bank. Such procurement,-however, will be limited
to (i) a maximum of one-third of SEGBA's needs for each category of equipment
and materials, and to (ii) a maximum price of 38% above the CIF price of
the successful foreign bidder for the same category of equipment and materials.
Use of this arrangement is expected to continue to be limited (it only
accounted for 5% of equipment procurement under the previous loan).
vi.       Since the new Government came into power in March 1976, it imme-
diately took steps to improve the financial situation of the public service
enterprises and a 10% monthly cumulative electricity tariff increase was
introduced for SEGBA with an additional 20% increase on July 1, 1976. The
Government intends to maintain this 10% monthly increase until December 1976
and thereafter grant tariff increases which will permit SEGBA to achieve
the 8% rate of return stipulated in its Concession Agreement, which in turn
will result in a substantial improvement in its finances and a satisfactory
contribution to the investment program from net internal cash generation.
The Government has also recently appointed competent new management for
SEGBA, which is well qualified to implement the project.
vii.      With the assurances  obtained during negotiations, listed in Section
7, the project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan to SEGBA of US$115
million equivalent for a period of 15 years including a grace period of three
years.



APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH BUENOS AIRES POWER PROJECT
SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES (SEGBA)
ARGENTINA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The Government of Argentina has requested the Bank to assist in the'
financing of a project which is part of the 1977-1981 expansion program of
Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA), a Government-owned corpora-
tion which together with Companla Italo-Argentina de Electricidad, S.A. (CIAE),
a corporation controlled by Swiss interests 1/, is responsible for supplying
electricity in the Greater Buenos Aires area.
1.02       The project proposed for Bank financing comprises the main elements
of SEGBA's ongoing transmission expansion program for the period 1977-1981,
together with the entire distribution expansion program for the same period.
These works will permit SEGBA to continue to provide the power distribution
infrastructure required to support the continued growth of industry in its
service area, which comprises Argentina's largest market for electricity. Also
included in the project proposed for Bank financing are studies to be carried
out by the Government with the assistance of consultants. The estimated cost
of the project is US$495.3 million (equivalent), including a foreign component
of US$152.6 million, part of which would be financed by the proposed loan of
US$115.0 million. SEGBA hopes to arrange cofinancing from foreign sources
for the balance of the foreign exchange requirements of the project.
1.03       The Bank has made four loans in the Argentine Power Sector: three
to SEGBA and one to HIDRONOR, S.A. (Hidroelectrica Norpatag6nica Sociedad An6nima).
The first loan to SEGBA (308-AR) for US$95.0 million was made in January 1962,
to complete the Costanera thermal station and expand transmission and distribu-
tion. The second loan (525-AR) for US$55.0 million was made six years later,
in January 1968, to help finance further expansion of SEGBA's generation, transmis-
sion and distribution facilities. A third loan (644-AR) for US$60.0 million was
made in November 1969 to help finance SEGBA's 1970-72 expansion program.
1.04       The physical execution of the three SEGBA projects financed by the Bank
was satisfactory. The third project was completed in-1973, with a delay of
approximately one year. One of the major long-term objectives of these loans
has been the building of SEBGA into an efficient and financially sound utility.
Unfortunately success in this direction has been limited. SEGBA suffered a
severe setback in 1964-1966 due to Government interference, which led to deteriora-
tion in SEGBA's financial position and delayed its expansion. However, after a new
management was appointed in mid-1966, significant progress was made in the
organization, effectiveness and finances of SEGBA.
1/Conversations between the Government and CIAE are underway to explore She
possibility   of the acquisition by the Government of a controlling interest
in CIAE.



-2-
1.05       History repeated itself in 1971 when the Government took over management
of the company. SEGBA's finances deteriorated dramatically when it was not
permitted to raise tariffs to keep pace with increased costs. This led to a sig-
nificant slowdown in SEGBA's expansion program and a financial situation where it-
could no longer cover annual interest payments out of income. However, it is
expected that SEGBA's finances will improve following tariff increases authorized
by the Government in 1976 (para. 2.14). The new management appointed in July 1976
is expected to bring SEGBA back to its previous efficiency of the period 1966-1971.
1.06       The loan to HIDRONOR (577-AR) for US$82 million was made in December
1968 to help finance a hydroelectric project about 1,100 km southwest of Buenos
Aires, comprising the first stage of the El Chocon-Cerros Colorados works. In
January 1973, an agreement amending the loan agreement expanded the project to
include the second stage of the El Chocon-Cerros Colorados works. After initial
problems with the turbines at El Chocon and the transmission line from El Chocon
to Buenos Aires, the initial project can now be considered to be running satisfact-
orily. The enlarged project is expected to be completed in 1977-1978.
1.07       HIDRONOR, SEGBA and other utilities making up the Argentine power sector
have developed considerable expertise within their spheres of activity. However,
organization, regulation and planning at the sector level need to be strengthened
substantially. The current authorities have recognized this need and the proposed
Bank loan would support the necessary studies.
1.08       A mission composed of Messrs. Alan A.M. Onslow and Renato E. Salazar
visited Buenos Aires in September/October 1974 to appraise the project and
SEGBA's expansion plans.  A reappraisal mission composed of Messrs. Claude Besse
and Manfredo Linder visited Buenos Aires in June/July 1976. This appraisal
report is based on the findings of both Bank missions and on the information
supplied by SEGBA.



-3-
2. THE POWER SECTOR
2.01       The fragmented organization of the Argentine power sector and the lack
of effective arrangements for central regulation and planning, have resulted in a
poorly conceived generation investment program. The present authorities have
decided to carry out a power sector organization study and to develop a national
power plan which will enable the country to make the most rational use of its
energy resources. Together with improved pricing policies for power and fuel the
implementation of the recommendations of these studies can be expected to lead to
sound future development of the sector.
Energy Resources
2.02      Argentina depends heavily on petroleum and natural gas which
accounted for 85% of total primary energy consumption in 1975. The Govern-
ment plans to reduce this proportion by expanding the production of nuclear
energy, hydroelectricity and possibly coal. The electric power sector could
make an important contribution to this objective, since the possibilities of
substitution of petroleum in other major energy-consuming sectors are limited
(electric energy accounted for 23% of total energy consumption in 1975). It
will, however, be difficult to achieve improvements in the energy consumption
structure without adequate planning of the expansion program for the whole energy
sector and in particular of the power sector.
2.03       Argentina is well-endowed with indigenous energy resources (Annex 1),
which are, however, relatively high-cost. The hydroelectric potential is sizeable
but only some 4% of this resource has been developed. Projects totaling another
8% of the known potential are under construction. Coal could also become an
important source of energy, especially for power generation, and the Government
intends to decide shortly on the investment program necessary to increase produc-
tion, which would permit switching some existing and future thermal plants from
oil to coal. At present Argentina imports about 11% of its petroleum and 15% of
its natural gas requirements, at a cost which is expected to reach US$450 million
in 1976. The Government intends to try to make the country self-sufficient by
intensifying the exploration and production of oil and natural gas through the
award of exploration contracts to international firms.
Sector Organization
2.04       The power sector is, in theory, regulated by the Secretarla de Energia,
which is responsible for planning, granting concessions to public utilities and
self-suppliers and approving tariffs. In practice, however, the Secretaria de
Energia has lost much of its authority to other branches of Government and to
the larger provincial utilities, with serious effects on the sector. The utilities
subject to the Secretaria's effective control are CIAE, HIDRONOR, SEGBA and Agua
y Energia Electrica (AyEE - the Federal water and power authority).  However, as
noted in Annex 2, some of their investments have been decided by other branches
of Government without reference to the requirements for rational development
of the power sector.



-4-
2.05       The Secretaria de Energia plays a marginal role in the decisions of the
Comision de -. Cuenca del Plata, CONCAP, a body which coordinates Argentina's
participation in international projects with Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.
This commission is under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, in
consequence, its decisions have been taken chiefly on the basis of foreign policy
conisiderations. At present, the principal sector activity of CONCAP is through its
participation in Comision Tecnica Mixta del Salto Grande (CTMSG - the Uruguayan-
Argentine binational authority in charge of building and operating the hydroelectric
system of Salto Grande); and Entidad Binacional Yacyreta-Apipe (EBY - the Paraguayan-
Argentine authority in charge of the planning, construction and operation of the
future Yacyreta-Apipe hydroelectric project on the Parana river).
2.06       The Secretaria de Energia has no practical influence on the activities
of the Comision Nacional de Energfa At6mica (CNEA - the national nuclear energy
commission) which is in charge of building and operating nuclear power plants and
reports directly to the President of Argentina.
2.07       The two major provincial electric companies controlled by the respective
provincial Governments are Direcci6n de Energla Electrica de la Provincia de Buenos
Aires (DEBA - serving a part of Buenos Aires province); and Empresa Provincial de
Energia de C6rdoba (EPEC).  The Secretarla de Energia has no formal influence or control
over these and other smaller provincial utilities, e.g., it has no voice in their
investment decisions nor does it approve their tariffs.
Power Market
2.08       Argentina is a highly electrified country and at present 80% of the
population have access to electricity. The per capita consumption is 991 kWh (1975).
The Greater Buenos Aires region is 90% electrified with a per capita consumption of
1,170 kWh (1975). The main consumer categories are industrial and residential,
accounting for 43% and 32% respectively of total consumption of public-service
electricity. Industrial consumption is the fastest-growing category. Approximately
700,000 rural dwellings are without electric service, and a rural electrification
plan is currently under execution (Annex 2).
2.09       In 1975, public service generation was 24,554 GWh compared with 16,800
GWh in 1970. Captive generation was 4,900 GWh, practically unchanged since 1970.
Total installed capacity in Argentina in 1975 was 9,280 MW of which about 2,000 MW
correspond to captive plant.
2.10       A proper long-term sales forecast for the power sector has yet to be
prepared.  However, it is clear that the projection adopted by the previous authorities
(implying a growth of 11.5% p.a. for the period 1976-1986) was unrealistic. A
reasonable forecast for demand growth in the central interconnected system of Argen-
tina (Greater Buenos Aires, Litoral, Buenos Aires South,-Comahue and Cordoba) is a grow,
of 0% for 1976, 5% for 1977 and 8% p.a. thereafter. A maximum growth alternative as
suggested by the Secretaria de Energia would be 0% growth in 1976, 5% in 1977, 8%
in 1978 and 10% p.a. thereafter.
Expansion Program
2.11       The main items of the generation expansion program of Argentina which
are under construction at the moment are shown in Annex 2. This investment



- 5 -
program is a result of the fragmented decision-making which has characterized the
power sector in the past and of the unrealistic sales forecast adopted by the
previous authorities. It will result in substantial. surplus generating capacity
until 1985, at considerable cost to the economy.
2.12       In view of this situation, the present authorities have reviewed all
outstanding commitments for major generation and transmission projects to determine
the possibility of delaying or cancelling them. A project in which HIDRONOR recently
started construction (Alicura), will be deferred for the present. No new national
projects will be started until the sector's priorities have been defined (para.2.13)
International projects will be discussed with the Governments concerned in order to
develop solutions compatible with the national interests of all countries involved.
Future of the Sector
2.13       The present Government is fully aware of the need for improvement in the
sector's structure and has,therefore,decided to carry out a national power sector
organization study and to prepare a national power expansion plan based on the
least-cost program for expanding generation and transmission, and agreed to discuss
the conclusions of these studies with the Bank. To carry out the studies the
Argentine authorities intend to retain individual international experts (to be
financed under the proposed loan) to assist in certain specific aspects where
national expertise is lacking. Furthermore, the Government has agreed not to approve
any major new investment in generation and transmission until the national power
expansion plan is prepared.
Tariffs and Asset Revaluation
2.14       On taking office in March 1976, the present Government took immediate
action to deal with the deteriorated finances of all public service enterprises and
to bring user charges in line with costs. In this connection, SEGBA was authorized
to raise its tariffs 10% monthly from April 1976 (a 20% additional increase was
authorized in July) and the Government intends to continue this policy until becember
1976 when it is expected that SEGBA will obtain the 8% rate of return on net re-
valued assets originally specified in its Concession Agreement. Similarly, AyEE was
permitted to raise its tariffs in monthly increments of 15%. The Government also
intends to raise the tariffs for bulk supply by HIDRONOR and CNEA's Atucha nuclear
power plant to provide an 8% rate of return on investment by end 1977 (see Annex 8).
In addition, the Government plans to increase prices for fuel used in electricity
generation (at present only 25% of international levels), gradually, so that by end-
1978 they approximate 75-80% of international prices.
2.15       There is no consistent approach to revaluation of power sector assets and
this may result in inconsistant pricing of electricity by different utilities, which
may lead to a misallocation of resources. As part of the planned sector organization
study,the Government intends to carry out a study to develop a uniform methodology
for the periodic revaluation of the assets of all power utilities.
Buenos Aires-Litoral Region
2.16       Argentina's principal power market is located in a region covering the
city of Buenos Aires and parts of the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre Rlos and Santa
Fe. This area,referred to as the Buenos Aires-Litoral region, includes 57% of the
country's population and accounts for 70% of total electric power consumption.



-6-
2.17       The regionis served by AyEE, CIAE, DEBA, HIDRONOR and SEGBA.  The main
sources of generation are the AyEE thermal stations at Santa Fe, Rosario and San
Nicolas, the SEGBA and CIAE thermal stations in Buenos Aires, CNEA's Atucha nuclear
station, and HIDRONOR's El Chocon hydroelectric station.  In 1979, the hydro power
plant of Salto Grande operated by CTMSG will also start serving this region.
2.18       To ensure the most economical use of faci1ftties to meet load conditions,
energy produced by these utilities is subject to a central dispatching system,
Despacho Unificado de Carga (DUC), coordinated by AyEE. This is consistent
with agreements included in the loan documents of previous Bank loans to the power
sector, which provide for central control of the generating plants supplying the
Greater Buenos Aires area. These agreements have been repeated in connection with
the proposed loan.
Greater Buenos Aires Subregion
2.19       Within the Buenos Aires-Litoral Region, the city of Buenos Aires and 31
surrounding municipalities of the province of Buenos Aires contain 70% of the
population and account for 71% of the consumption of electric power. This power
is distributed by SEGBA and CIAE, which in 1976 had an installed  generating capacity
of 2,971 MW, all thermal (see AnneK 3 for details). SEGBA is the principal supplier
and its concession covers the whole subregion.  CIAE's concession area (which over-
laps with that of SEGBA) includes one third of the city of Buenos Aires and four of
the remaining municipalities.  In addition to their participation in the DUC system,
SEGBA and CIAE have been coordinating their investment programs to avoid the duplica-
tion of facilities which might otherwise result from their overlapping concession
areas, in accordance with a provision of previous loan agreements which has been
repeated under the proposed loan.
2.20       SEGBA and CIAE served 3.1 million consumers in 1975 (of which 2.7 million
by SEGBA) and sold 10,300 GWh (of which 8,800 GWh by SEGBA). Captive plants in the
subregion generated 1,400 GWh in 1975, which is relatively large. These plants
were installed by many industrial and commercial consumers due to the power shortages
of the 1950s and early 1960s, but as a result of SEGBA's ability to provide more
reliable service their output has stagnated since 1970.
Service to Low-Income Groups
2.21       The low-income population of the Greater Buenos Aires area has grown
very rapidly due to immigration from rural areas and neighboring countries and large
shanty towns have developed. These shanty towns have no urbanization infrastructure
and many of these dwellings are connected to the nearest power line through illegal
hook-ups which present serious problems of safety, in addition to financial losses
to SEGBA.
2.22       SEGBA has estimated that about o50,000 persons live in 70,000 dwellings
in 110 different shanty towns. SEGBA intends to reach agreements with the municipal-
ities, where these shanty towns are located, on a plan which would consist of selling
energy to the municipality in bulk for distribution within each shanty-town.



- 7 -
2.23       There are about 25,000 dwellings corresponding to new low-cost housing
developments without legal electric service. SEGBA intends to connect these new
consumers during the next three years with an investment of about US$6.0 million.
This would form part of the project.

3. THE BORROWER
Legislation
3.01      SEGBA, the proposed borrower is a corporation formed in 1958 to take
over most of the assets and responsibilities of the Compai'ila Argentina de
Electricidad (CADE). Its shares are wholly owned by the Argentine Government
through the Corporacion de Empresas Nacionales (CEN), a holding company for
most government-owned enterprises. Although this holding company has legal
powers governing the general policies of its subsidiaries, the latter have
retained their autonomy in carrying out their day-to-day business. The present
Government is studying the future of CEN. One possible alternative would
be to do away with it in order to streamline the relationship of public
sector enterprises with the Government.
3.02      SEGBA's Concession Agreement (signed February 1, 1962 and approved
by Decree No. 1247 of February 8, 1962) gives the company responsibility for
electricity supply in the metropolitan Buenos Aires area on a non-exclusive
basis (para. 2.19) and for an indefinite period. The Concession Agreement
establishes in great detail the rights and obligations of SEGBA and the
Government, including the basis for setting power rates (para. 3.12).
3.03      SEGBA's Bylaws, as approved in 1961 in connection with Loan 308-AR,
were intended to ensure responsible management, efficiency and financial viability.
Considerable progress towards these objectives took place in the period
1966-70. However, the political and economic conditions in the country during
the following five years, led to Government interference in SEGBA's internal
affairs, accompanied by considerable management instability. The Bylaws
were amended in 1972 to reflect the Government's intention to exert a greater
degree of control over the company. This action was reversed with the
approval of new Bylaws in July 1976, which are basically the same as those
of 1961 and are adequate. As under previous loans, it was agreed that any,
substantial amendment of either the Bylaws or the Concession Agreement which
shall adversely and substantially affect SEGBA's operations or its financial
condition would constitute an event of default.
Organization and Management
3.04      SEC-BA has a Board of Directors of eight members, appointed by the
Government through CEN. The Board chooses two of its members to serve as
President (Chairman of the Board) and Executive Vice President (General
Manager). The Executive Vice President is responsible for day-to-day manage-
ment. He is assisted by a committee of six department heads (Administration
and Finance; Planning; Personnel; Procurement; Commercial; and Technical).
3.05      During the execution of SEGBA's Third Project, considerable improve-
ments were introduced in the Commercial and Technical Departments. Customer
service, meter reading, collections not handled by mail or through banks,
construction of low voltage lines, installation of transformers and connection
of new customers have been decentralized. This required a major reorganization
and has resulted in greatly improved service and operation. A new system
of reporting outages in the generation, transmission and distribution system
is being implemented. This should be completed by 1978 and would permit
management to monitor the quality of service provided by the utility.



-9-
3.06      There has been improvement, too, in SEGBA's Planning Department which
is now self-sufficient and is not expected to require the services of outside
consultants. The Personnel and Procurement Departments have an adequate
organization and perform efficiently. In order to meet its financial
goals, it is necessary that SEGBA improve its Administration and Finance
Department, particularly in the area of financial plannina. There is also
need to accelerate its accounting procedures and budget controls so that
the monthly reports are available on time. The new management is aware of
this situation and is studying different alternatives for achieving these
goals.
3.07      The new Government appointed a new Board of Directors which took
charge of SEGBA's management in July 1976. The current Executive Vice
President is a capable engineer with more than 30 years' service with SEGBA
and its predecessor utility. Before resigning in 1972, he held the post
of technical manager. The newly appointed managers and assistant managers
are experienced SEGBA staff members and constitute a competent team which
is well qualified to implement the project. It had been agreed under previous
loans that the Bank would be consulted prior to the appointment of a new
Executive Vice President. This provision has proven to be of limited value
and it was agreed to amend previous loan agreements to delete it.
Employment
3.08      In previous appraisal reports it was indicated that SEGBA faced
major problems due to employment levels far in excess of those usual for
the sector. These resulted from the unusual strength of SEGBA's labor union.
Though there was significant improvement in the period 1966-7l the situation
worsened during recent years. The new economic authorities and the new
management of SEGBA are fully aware of this problem and intend to reduce
substantially the number of employees from the present figuLreof 26,300 to
22,800 in 1978. This means increasing the number of customers per employee
from 102 in 1975 to 126 in 1978. This goal is reasonable and is among the
performance indicators to be monitored during the execution of the project
(para. 5.06).
Training
3.09      SEGBA has a very comprehensive training program and maintains two
centers to fulfill the majority of its training needs. Other specialized
training is carried out at other local institutions (technical Universities,
etc.) and for very specialized subjects (for graduate engineers) use is made
of the training facilities of Electricite de France and of suppliers of
sophisticated equipment. SEGBA intends to train 2,000 persons during the
years 1977-1978 in subjects varying from low-tension networks maintenance
to load dispatching.
Accounting and Audit
3.10      SEGBA's accounting, internal audit and data processing are satis-
factory. Nearly all commercial and accounting processes as well as personnel
records, stores inventories and procurement are computerized. The monthly
financial statements and the budgetary reports have been delayed in recent
months. The necessary steps are being taken to speed up their preparation
and ensure their timely availability.



- 10
3.11      Until 1973 SEGBA had its accounts audited annually by independent
accountants acceptable to the Bank. In 1974 SEGBA was required to have
its accounts audited by CEN and it cancelled its arrangements with its former
auditors. CEN, which also audited SEGBA's 1975 accounts, cannot, as the
utility's owner,be considered independent.   For 1976 and future years, SEGBA
agreed to employ independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and to forward
certified copies of the annual financial statements together with the
.auditor's detailed reports to the Bank within four months of the end of
each financial year. SEGBA has indicated that it intends to appoint as
auditors a firm of public accountants.
Power Rates
3.12      As explained in Annex 4, the Concession Agreement provides that
SEGBA's rates should generate revenues sufficient to produce a return of
8% on its revalued rate base and contains detailed provisions on filing for
tariff increases, recovery of shortfalls in earnings and interim rate increases.
In 1969 SEGBA earned more than 8% and so, in accordance with the Concession
Agreement, rates were reduced by 1.3% effective January 1, 1970, to compen-
sate for the excess earnings. This was the last time that the Concession
Agreement was observed. As noted in para 6.02, SEGBA has failed to earn
its stipulated 8% return since 1970 and, although it submitted applications
for rate adjustments the Government did not grant the full increases requested.
The provisions which call for recovery of prior years' shortfalls and interim
rate increases to offset rising costs, were not applied.
3.13      As noted in para. 2.14 the new Government has taken steps to
improve SEGBA's financial situation by raising its tariffs. SEGBA agreed to
request and the Government to grant tariff increases which will permit SEGBA
to obtain in 1977 and thereafter the 8% rate of return as stipulated in the
Concession Agreement.
Tariff Structure
3.14      Details of SEGBA's tariff structure are shown in Annex 4.  The
tariff schedule for residential consumers is based on a low, "social" rate
for small consumers (less than 60 kWh/month), with progressively higher
charges to larger residential users. Tariffs for large industrial consumers
include a charge related to maximum demand at the time of the system peak
with reductions for accepting supply at higher voltages and for off-peak
consumption. The latter are important factors in encouraging more economic
patterns of consumption, and SEGBA should consider strengthening them.
3.15      SEGBA should also consider the possibility of introducing a more
elaborate tariff structure for medium-sized commercial and industrial
consumers with a maximum demand of less than 50 kW. Such consumers are
presently included in a "general service" category which does not provide
any incentive for high voltage supply or off-peak consumption.
3.16      The improvements suggested above should be introduced gradually,
in connection with the annual rate adjustments. The Government and SEGBA



- 11 -
have agreed to carry out a study of SEGBA's tariff structure with a view
to identifying areas in which changes are required to induce improved
patterns of consumption and to discuss its conclusions with the Bank.

4. TIIE PROJECT
4.01       The next step in the expansion of the generating capacity in the
Buenos Aixes system is a 310 MW steam unit at SEGBA's Costanera station to be
commissioned in 1980. A new 350 MW steam unit was commissioned in June 1976.
No further expansien of generating capacity by SEGBA or CIAE is presently
envisaged and the incremental requirements of the Greater Buenos Aires area
will have to Le met by increased imports of energy from other utilities (see
Annex 3).
4.02       To receive the imported power, interconnect local generating plants
arid facilitate distribution, SEGBA has planned a ring around the periphery of the
Greater Buenos Aires area,initially to operate at 220 kV (double-circuit) and to
be transformed (as part of the project) to a single-circuit line at 500 kV.
Another single-circuit line at 500 kV would also be added. This ring (map 11442R)
will link the Costanera station, which in turn is interconnected with the other
SEGBA and CIAE generating stations along the Rio de la Plata, with the Ezeiza
and Rodriguez substations,which are receiving points for imported power.
4.03       This ring (500 kV and 220 kV) is planned to feed a number of 220 kV
substations, which in turn feed the subtransmission network of 132 kV. This net-
work (132 kV) feeds ,he mid-tension system (mainly 13.2 kV with some 33 kV and
27.5 kV subs:ations). The project includes expansion of ten 132 kV substations
anid the construction of 21 new 132 kV substations.
4.04       The mid-tension system feeds the low tension network operating at
380/220 volts, 50 Hz. This network is under continuous expansion due to the
increase of load in areas under service and to the extension of service to new
areas (approximately 65,000 new connections per year).
Project Cost
4.05       The project includes the main elements of the ongoing transmission
expansion program for the period 1977-1981, to be commissioned before mid-1981
together with SEGBA's distribution expansion program for the same period and the
studies to be carried out by the Government (para. 2.13). It is described in
detail in Annex 6. The following are the estimated costs of the project:

4.06       These estimates were prepared by SEGBA and are based on prices corresponding
to mid-1976 as quoted by different manufacturers.  Physical contingencies were estimated
at 2% for all project components, except £or the 500 kV items for which a 10% contingency
was assuimed.  This is reasonable as SEGBA  has great experience in works up to and
1/ Converted at the free rate of exchange 1 US$        250 $a,



_ 14 -
including 220 kV and no experience in 500 kV installations.  The breakdown
between foreign and local costs is based on the assumptions shown in Annex 6.
Price contingencies for both local and foreign costs were based on the following
percentages: 4.5% in 1976 (half-year), 8% p.a. in 1977 through 1979, and 7% p.a. there-
after. The estimated cost for engineering, supervision and administration was
based on SEGBA's experience with ongoing works. It is estimated that 60 man-
months of consulting services would be required, at an average cost of US$4870
per man-month (excluding travel and subsistence - see Annex 6).
Procurement and Disbursements
4.07       The proposed procurement procedures for the project are similar to
those used for the previous loan to SEGBA and may be summarized as follows:
- SEGBA will invite bids internationally for quantities equivalent
to two-thirds of its needs of each category of equipment or materials
and will request simultaneously separate bids, from Argentine manufacturers
only, for an additional one-third. In awarding contracts for the main
quantities bid internationally, Argentine bidders will be granted a 15%
margin, of preference over the CIF price of the lowest qualified foreign
bidder or the applicable custon.s duty, whichever is lower. In addition,
0.5% of the CIF cost will be added to the CIF cost of foreign bids to
take into account the difference in the cost of inspection during manuBactui
in Argentina and abroad. Under Argentine law, local manufacturers will
also be exempt from sales tax and import duties on raw materials and
component parts.1/
- If an Argentine manufacturer bids successfully under the 15%
preference, SEGEA may also invite him to supply the additional one-
third at the same unit price bid for the main quantity.
- If a foreign bidder is awarded the contract for the main quantity,.
the separate Argentine bids for the additional one-third will then
be opened. The corresponding second contract will be awarded to the
lowest of the Argentine bidders provided that (i) his quoted price
is less than 38% above the CIF price of the successful foreign bidder
above or, if not, that (ii) he is willing to reduce his .price to
such level. Equipment and materials procured locally under these
conditions will not be eligible for Bank financing.
- If no Argentine bidder is willing to reduce his price, the successful
foreign bidd'er for the main quantity may be invited to supply also the
additional one-third, at the same unit price.
4.08       The procurement arrangements described above would thus ensure that:
(a)   the Bank will finance only equipment and materials procured through
interrnational competitive bidding, including a maximum domestic
preference of 15%;
I/ The so called "destination check charge", which is levied on duty-free imports,
would not be included in the cost of foreign bids or in the cost of imported
raw materials and components included in local bids.



- 15 -
(b)   local procurement without international competitive bidding, to
be financed from sources other than the Bank, would be limited to
(i) a maximum quantity of one-third of SEGBA's nedds for each
category of equipment and materials, and to (ii) a maximum price
of 38% above the CIF price of the successful foreign bidder for the
same category of equipment and materials, In this case the other
two-thirds would be awarded to the successful foreign bidder. The
cost to SEGBA of the combined foreign and local contracts would
average a maximum of about 12.7% above the cost of the foreign
bid.
Restricted procurement, under the provisions outlined in (b) above was only employed
to a very limited extent (5% of the value of equipment contracts) in SEGBA's Third
Project. It is also expected to have a limited application in the project
financed by the proposed loan.
4.09       The proposed loan would be disbursed to finance:
(a)   100% of the foreign cost of imported equipment;
(b)   60% of the cost of equipment procured locally, under international
competitive bidding as explained above (the estimated foreign exchange
component); and
(c)   100% of the total cost of the consultants hired to assist in carrying
out the studies mentioned in para. 2.13.
Estimated loan disbursements are shown in Annex 12.

4.10       The 500/220 kV ring was conceived after a series of studies done by
SEGBA with the assistance of consultants (SOFRELEC of France) in 1969. The basic
concepts for the distribution expansion program are based on studies by consultants
(Merz and McLellan of the UK). As noted'in para. 3.06, SEGBA is not expected to
require the services of consultants for the project.
4.11       SEGBA employs contractors for the construction of high and mid-tension
overhead and underground transmission lines, for a part of the low-tension distribu--
tion lines and substations and for the new high-tension substations. Expansions of
existing substations, part of the low-tension distribution lines and substations
and service connections will be undertaken by SEGBA's own forces. The project
implementation schedule (Annex 5) was confirmed by SEGBA during negotiations.
Environment
4.12       SEGBA has carried out its previous projects with due regard to environmental
factors and intends to give special attention to reduce adverse visual effects result-
ing from this project, by conforming to applicable zoning regulations. The project
is, therefore, not expected to have any adverse impact on the environment.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Sector ObLectives
5.01       The Bank's objectives in lending to the power sector in Argentina are:
(a)   to assist the Government in improving sector organization, regulation,
planning, financing and operation, in order to ensure that these functions
are carried out in future with maximum regard to economy ;nd efficiency;
and
(b)   to assist the Government in formulating a national power expansion plan
based on the least-cost program for expanding generation and transmission
facilities. This plan would incorporate: (i) reasonable criteria for
establishing system reserves and (ii) the most rational use of indigenous
energy resources for power generation (e.g. coal, uranium, and hydro-
electricity).
Project Objectives
5.02       Besides helping the Government to achieve the above mentioned goals, the
project would provide SEGBA with the transmission facilities necessary to permit
utilization of the energy produced at the hydro power plants of El Chocon, Planicie
Banderita and Salto Grande and at the nuclear power plant at Atucha. The availability
of this energy will allow SEGBA to meet the increasing demand of power due to
revitalization of industrial activities in Argentina as a result of the economic
policy applied by the present Government. The industrial sector has been the main
factor in the growth of electricity consumption (56% of the total over the last five
years) and the project would provide the facilities required to support a continua-
tion of this growth. The project also would provide the distribution facilities
necessary to bring electricity to final consumers (65,000 new consumers are expected
to be connected annually), reduce losses and improve the efficiency of SEGBA's
operation and the reliability of service due to the incorporation of urgently needed
comnunications, telecontrol, telemetering and load dispatching equipment.
Load Forecast
5.03       As a result of the socio-economic problems which have faced Argentina
since 1974, SEGBA's sales have increased only slightly since that year. This
basically is due to a decline of industrial activity as SEGBA has kept on connecting
about 50,000 new customers (mainly residential) per annum since then. Argentina's
new authorities are implementing an economic program designed to reduce inflation,
increase exports, encourage new investments and revitalize industrial
activity, and as a consequence electric energy consumption is expected to start
growing again in 1977. SEGBA's load forecast assumes that in 1976 energy consumption
will remain substantially the same as in 1975, and in 1977 a moderate increase of 5%
will occur as a result of higher industrial consumption. From 1978 onwards a yearly
increase of 8% (the historical growth rate in the Buenos Aires region) is assumed. Th
power and energy balance for SEGBA's system is shown in Table 1 of Annex 3. This
forecast has been accepted by the Government and appears reasonable. Generation
capacity is more than sufficient to supply the incremental energy and the project
will ensure the availability of the necessary transmission and distribution facilities



17
High Tension System (500, 220 and 132 kV)
5.04       With the help of consultants (SOFRELEC - France) SEGBA analyzed various
alternative solutions to feed its distribution systems and a 220 kV system (con-
vertible to 500 kV) was found to be the least-cost solution with a ring surrounding
an area of approximately 3,500 km2. The section of the ring connecting the Rodriguez,
Ezeiza and Abasto has to be converted to 500 kV by 1981 to permit utilization of the
energy to be provided by the Salto Grande hydro power plant and from the San Nicolas
steam power plant of AyEE in the greater Buenos Aires region. This follows the
recommendations of the SOFRELEC study. Considering rights-of-way and environmental
factors, the location of the ring, as conceived by SEGBA, appears the best practicable
solution.
Distribution System (mid and low-tension)
5.05       The project will cover 5 years of distribution network construction
(1977-1981). As is shown in Annex 7, the existing installed capacity of distribution
transformers plus the proposed expansion of capacity under the project will bring
total installed capacity up to the requirements in 1981, due account being taken of
the capacity required for rehabilitation of the existing system.  The unit base
cost of the distribution expansion and rehabilitation component of the project
is US$175/kVA at mid-1976 prices, which is reasonable.
Performance Indicators
5.06       The project is expected to lead to improved efficiency through lower
system losses and better service brought about by a reduction in outages and
improved voltage regulation. The upgrading of SEGBA's load dispatching and control
systems, as a result of the project,will also improve the quality of service and
permit a reduction of operating personnel. The reduction in losses and other
improvements are reflected in the targets specified in Annex 13, which would be
used to monitor SEGBA's performance during project implementation.
Return on Investment
5.07       The benefits attributable to the project have been estimated on the basis
of the value of the electric energy to be distributed as measured by SEGBA's revenues
and associated sales taxes paid by the ultimate consumer. The return on the project
investment has been evaluated'as the discount rate which equalizes these benefits
with the associated costs which include the'investment'and operating cost of the
project and the cost of power delivered to the'transmission and distribution system.
As shown in Annex 7, the rate of return on the project investment amounts to 21%.
The sensitivity analysis in Annex 7 shows that the rate-of return would exceed
18% even if costs are assumed to rise by 10%.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      Since the Bank made its first loan to SEGBA in 1962, SEGBA's
financial situation has fluctuated considerably. It has a sound Concession
Agreement, which, if consistently applied, would have enabled SEGBA to
mobilize through self-financing and borrowings on commercial terms the
sizeable amounts required to support its capital expansion. While these
objectives were achieved during significant portions of the period since
1962, there have been two periods when failure to follow the Agreement
have required massive injections of government funds or a slowdown in
expansion. The present Government has agreed to implement a realistic
tariff policy (see para. 2.14) and has taken steps to restore SEGBA's
efficiency. This should allow SEGBA to fulfill in due course the objectives
pursued since the first loan.
Past Record and Present Position
6.02      Instead of the 8% return on its rate base guaranteed by its
Concession Agreement, SEGBA earned 5.4% in 1970, 1.8% in 1971, 1.3% in 1972,
less than 1% in 1973 and its earnings for 1974 and 1975 were negative (see
Annex 8). This performance was particularly poor since SEGBA paid very
low prices for its purchases of fuel and electricity from other public
enterprises. The contribution of internal resources to the financing of
SEGBA's investment, which had been in excess of 50%, became negative. Net
operating income actually failed to cover interest charges in 1973-75.
6.03      The following summarizes SEGBA's balance sheet as at December 31,
1975 (see note 1 to Annex 9).
ASSETS                                 Millions of
US dollars
Gross plant in service          1,436.5
Less depreciation and
customers' contributions        492.2
Net Plant in service                        944.3
Work in progress                            181.7
Net current and deferred
assets                                    (69.2)
1,056.8
LIABILITIES
Equity                                      744.4
Long-term debt, less current portion        312.4
- 1,056.8
SEGBA's debt/equity ratio;, including the current portion of debt, was a low
34/66.
6.04      Accounts receivable for electricity amount to about 94 days' billings
which is high. Accounts of public sector agencies are particularly slow in
collection. In view of these collection problems, the Government agreed to



- 19 -
talr.e all reasonable action within its constitutional powers, to enable
political subdivisions and agencies, including municipal and provincial
authorities, to service their accounts on a timely basis. SEGBA intends
.:o reduce accounts receivable to 75 days' billings by 1977. The ratio
of receivr-bles to sales is among the performance indicators to be monitored
durii!g project execution (para. 5.06).
6.05      By comparison with 1975, and as a result of the tariff increases
introduced by the new authorities, SEGBA's financial situation has improved
considerably in 1976. Earnings, however, are still expected to be very low
and the contribution of internal cash generation to the expansion program
to be marginal (3.6%). SEGBA's total shortfall in earnings with respect
to its authorized 8% rate of return as of December 31, 1976, is estimated
at US$123.4 million. To offset this shortfall, the Government intends to:
(a) make available US$86.8 million through budgetary funds - of which
US$50.3 million have been budgeted in 1976 and the balance is expected to be
provided by June 30, 1977; and (b) allow SEGBA to charge tariffs in excess
of those required to earn 8% in the years 1977-79 (see para. 6.10).
Financing Plan
6.06      SEGBA's planned investments include (in addition to the proposed
project ) the completion of ongoing generation, transmission and
distribution works including the 310 MW generating unit at the Costanera
plant (para. 4.01); and the initial portion of projects designed to cover
requirements after 1981. The estimated sources and applications of funds
of SEGBA for the six-year period 1976-1981 are shown in Annex 11. The
financing plan for the disbursement period of the proposed loan (1977-1980)
is summarized below:

In the period the contribution from internal cash generation to the investment
program will be 51.3%, which is satisfactory.
6.07      The proposed US$115 million Bank loan to SEGBA would cover 75% of
the foreign exchange cost of the Project. An interest rate of 8.9% has been
assumed, and a term of 15 years including a grace period of three years. The
proposed loan includes US$500,000 for studies to be carried out under the
direction of the Secretaria de Energia (para. 2.13). SEGBA would act as
disbuasing agent only for these funds and is expected to be reimbursed by
the Government from the proceeds of the various taxes it ccllects from
power consumers on the latter's behalf. The Government and SEGBA have agreed
to make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the transfer of these funds
and their repayment.
6.08      TIhe balance of SEGBA's financial requirements for the period 1977-
1980 is expected to be met by the Government's 1977 contribution (US$36.5
million - para. 6.05), loans from foreign and local banks (US$206.0 million),
and the drardown of existing loans (US$39.8 million).- To ensure that these
funds will be made available, the Government agreed that it will provide
t.he equivalent of US$36.5 million by June 30, 1977 and it would cause to be



- 21 -
peovideA. not less than the equivalent of US$25.0 million in 1977, US$42.0
mrllion in 1978, US$59.0 million in 1979 and US$80.0 million in 1980 on terms
a/d conditions satisfactory to the Bank. These amounts would be sufficient
cc protect SEGBA against any failure to secure financing from foreign and
local banks.
6.09      A foreign financial institution has expressed its interest in
cor.sidering the financing of a part of the foreign and local cost of the
project through a cofinancing arrangement with the Bank.  SEGBA and the
potential lender have been informed that the Bank would be prepared to
consider such an arrangement at SEGBA's request, provided it would result
in better terms for SEGBA than it could otherwise obtain.
Future Finances
6.fl)     The forecast Income Statements (Annex 8) are based on the assumption
that in 1977-1979, SEGBA will attain a 9% rate of return in order to recover
a part of the earnings shortfalls accumulated through December 1976. Thereafter
thn projections assume achievement of the rate of return set in the Concession
Agreement, namely 8%. The projection of SEGBA's operating costs takes into
account the substantial increases expected in the prices paid by SEGBA for
fuel and purchased power (para. 2.1s).
6.11      Annex 9 gives estimated balance sheets for the period 1976- 81.
Net plant in service is expected to increase from US$944.3 million in 1975
to US$1,617.8 million in 1981 (71%). Over the same period, long-term
Tndebtedness uld only increase by 58%. The foregoing indicates satisfactory
internal generation of resources.
n.12      The debt/equity ratio would decline from 34/66 in 1975 to 31/69
in 1981. SEGBA agreed that it would not contract any long-term indebtedness
without the Bank's concurrence if its internal cash generation is less than
1.5 times maximum future debt-service obligations. In prior loan agreements,
SEGBA's borrowings had been limited by a combined debt-to-assets and interest
coverage test, which is no longer being used in connection with most Bank
power loans. These agreements would be amended to substitute the limitation
.ased on a projected debt service coverage test described above.
6.13      SEGBA also agreed to afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to
comment on any major expansion program, other than the project, which it
may propose to undertake prior to the completion of the latter.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with SEGBA on the
following principal points:
a)   Satisfactory arrangements will be made with the Government
for the transfer of US$500,000 to pay for the experts hired
to assist the Government in carrying out the studies mentioned
in para. 7.02 (a) (paras. 2.13 and 6.07);
b)   Planning, expansion and operation of the power facilities of
all utilities supplying Greater Buenos Aires will be coordinated
(paras. 2.18 and 2.19);
c)   A substantial change in SEGBA's Bylaws and Concession Agreement
will be an event of default (para. 3.03);
d)   The accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank (para. 3.11);
e)   SY;GBA will request tariff increases in accordance with its
Concession Agreement starting in 1977 (para. 3.13);
f)   Possible improvements ir SEGBA's tariff structure will be
studied (para. 3.16);
g)   SEGBA will not incur any debt without the Bank's concurrence
if it cannot meet the debt limitation test (para. 6.12);
h)   SEGBA will afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange
views on any major expansion (para. 6.13).
7. 02     Agreement was reached with the Government on the following principal
points:
a)   The Government will carry out a national power sector organization
study, prepare a national power expansion plan, and exchange
views with the Bank on the findings and recomrmendations of
these studies; it will not approve any new major investment in
generation and transmission until the national power expansion
plan is prepared; and it will make satisfactory arrangements
with SEGBA for the transfer of inds included in the Bank loan
for these studies (paras. 2.13 and 6.07);
b)   Plalnning, expansion and operation of the power facilities of
all utilities supplying Greater Euenos Aires will be coordinated
(paras. 2.18 and 2.19);
c)   SEGBA will be allowed to charge rates required to comply with
its Concession Agreement (para. 3.13);
d)   The Government will assist SEGBA in carrying out the study of
its rate structure (para. 3.16);



- 23 -
e)   The Government will take action in respect of the timely
settlement of debts of public sector agencies to SEGBA (para.
6.04);
f)   The Government will provide to SEGBA not less than the equivalent
of US$36.5 million by June 30, 1977 (para.6.08); and
g)   The Government will cause loans to be made to SEGBA of not less
than the equivalent of US$25.0 million, US$42.0 million,
US$59.0 million and US$80.0 million during the years 1977,
1978, 1979 and 1980 on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 6.08).
7.03      With the indicated assurances, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$115 million equivaleat for a term of
15 years including a grace period of 3 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH BUENOS AIRES POWER PROJECT
SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES (SEGBA)
ARGENTINA
THE ENERGY SECTOR
1.        The primary consumption of energy of Argentina in 1975 was
estimated at 35.2 million Toe, I/ and has grown at an average rate of 3.4%
during the period 1970-1975. The relative contribution of the different
energy sources for the years 1970 and 1975 are shown below:
1970         1975
Coal and Shale                       3.0           3.4
Petroleum products                  71.3          62.3
Natural Gas                         17.4          22.7
Hydroelectricity                     1.3           4.2
Nuclear Energy                       -             1.7
Vegetal fuels                        7.0.          5.7
The percentages of total energy consumption used in the form of electric
energy are for the years 1970 and 1975, 20% and 23% respectively. The use
of different energy sources for the generation of electric energy is as
follows:
1970         1975
Coal and Shale                      28.5          21.6
Petroleum products                  20.3          16.9
Natural Gas                         23.5          25.5
Hydroelectricity                   100.0         100.0
Nuclear Energy                       -           100.0
Vegetal fuels                        2.4           2.5
2.        Estimated known (1975) reserves of the different indigenous energy
resources are as follows:
Hydroelectricity (MW)                     45,000
Oil (m3 x 103)                           390,000
Natural Gas (m3 x 103 - equiv. oil)    200,000
Uranium ore (tons of U3 08)               62,000 2/
Coal (tons x 106)                             450
1/   Toe = Ton of oil equivalent i.e. 107 Kcalories.
2!   The Argentine authorities have just reported that an assured supply of 24,000
tons of these uranium fuel reserves would cost less than US$100/kg, which is
economic by international standards.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
In most: cases, these resources are quite high - cost: and sizeable investments
will be required for their conmi.ercial development.
3.        Hydroelectric resources havre been utilized very little up to now
but. important construction programs are underway or in preparation. Approx-
imnately 3,600 MW of hydroelectric gei.erating capacity is under construction,
WhiLil would raise the present percentage of utilization of 3.8% to 12% by
1982-1983.
4.        Studies have been carried out to determine the feasibility of
increasing coal production from the present value of about 0.5 million tons
to 3 million per year, which would permit switching from oil to coal in the
major steam turbine units in Argentina. The Government is presently reviewing
these studies, prior to taking a decision. Technical and financial constraints
taay be encountered which could delay implementation of these plans.
5.        The high proportion of petroleum products and natural gas in the
total consumption is in part a result of the availability of these fuels for
power generation at low price (e.g. about 25% of international levels for
fuel-oil used in power stations). In contrast gasoline pricing is realistic.
This situation can hardly be maintained in the future and the Government
intends to implement a program directed toward replacement of petroleum
products by use of nuclear energy (using indigenous uranium) coal and hydro-
electricity. On the other hand the Government also plans to raise to a more
realistic level the price of fuel (75 - 80% of international prices by end-
1978) used in power generation.
6.        At present about 11% of petroleum and 15% of natural gas consumption
is imported, which in 1976 is expected to result in a cost to the Argentine
economy of US$450 million. The Government also intends to make Argentina
self-sufficient in this respect by intensifying the exploration of oil and
natural gas by awarding contracts to international firms.

As can be seen Argentina is a highly electrified country with 80% of the population
with access to electric energy, with a per capita production of 1156 kWh and
consumption of 991 kWh. The Buenos Aires region is over 90% electrified with a
total per capita consumption of 1170 kWh. However, about 700,000 to 800,000 rural
dwellings are without electric service in Argentina. The Inter-American
Development Bank made a US$43 million loan in 1974 for a Rural Electrification Plan
which would gradually bring the benefits of electricity to about 100,000 rural
inhabitants during the years 1975 through 1978 at a total cost of US$100 million.

2.        In 1975 public service generation was 24,554 GWh compared with 16,800
GWh in 1970. Captive generation was 4,900 GWh, unchanged since 1970. Total
installed capacity in Argentina in 1975 was 9,280 MW of which about 2,000 MW
corresponds to captive plant. It is expected that as public service reliability
increases self-supplying consumers will discontinue their power generation
except for those generating as a by-product of industrial process steam.
3.        The break-down of public service consumption according to categories
of consumer is as follows (for the whole country):
GWh (Total)   Residential   Commercial   Industrial    Other
1970         13,798          36.2          13.3          35.7        14.8
1971         15,222          34.5          12.7          38.3        14.5
1972         16,898          33.2          12.2          40.8        13.8
1973         18,054          32.4          11.9          42.0        13.7
1974         19,081          31.9          11.3          43.0         13.8
1975         20,420          32.0          11.4          42.7        13.9

Thus industrial consumption has been the fastest-growing category, accounting
for 56% of the growth in public-service consumption over the last 5 years.
The relationship between electricity production per capita and GNP per capita
is as follows (for the whole country):

Power Sector Organization
4.        The power sector in Argentina is essentially owned by the Government
and is regulated partially by it through the Secretarla de Energla, a branch
of the Ministry of Economy.  The privatT1y owned company is Compafiia Italo
Argentina de Electricidad, S.A. (CIAE),- which serves one third of the city
of Buenos Aires and has an installed generating capacity of 585 MW (see
Annex 3). A number of provincially owned electric utilities exist; their
principal function is to distribute electric energy though they own some
generating installations.
The major entities involved in the power sector are:
-    AyEE               Agua y Energla Electrica (operates in the whole
country and also is in charge of irrigation)
-    CONCAP             Comision Nacional de la Cuenca del Plata (controls
the Argentine representatives in the two international
entities EBY and CTMSG)
-    CIAE               Comision Italo Argentina de Electricidad, S.A.
(a private company operating in Buenos Aires -
see above)
-    CNEA               Comisi6n Nacional de Energia Atomica (in charge
of nuclear energy; constructs and operates the
nuclear power plants)
-    CTMSG              Comision .Tecnica Mixta de Salto Grande (the
Uruguayan-Argentine binational authority in
charge of building and later operating the
hydroelectric project of Salto Grande)
-    DEBA               Direccion de Energla Electrica de la Provincia de
Buenos Aires (provincial electric utility serving
a part of Buenos Aires province)
-    EBY                Entidad Binacional Yacyreta-Apipe (the binational
Paraguayan-Argentine authority in charge of the
planning, construction and finally operation of
the Yacyreta-Apipe hydroelectric project on the
Parana river).
-    EPEC               Empresa Provincial de Energla de Co'rdoba (the
provincial electric utility serving the Cordoba
region; will soon (1977) be interconnected with the
Buenos Aires-Litoral system)
1/ Talks between the Government and CIAE are underway to explore the possibility
of acquisition of a controlling interest in CIAE by the Government.



ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 9 pages
-    HIDRONOR             Hidroelectrica Norpatag6nica, Sociedad Anonima
(the utility in charge of the development and
operation of the hydro resources of the North
Patagonian region. At present is completing
the El Choc6n hydroelectric project (1,200 MW)
and building the Planicie Banderita power station
(450MW).
-    SEGBA                Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires (the
major utility serving the Buenos Aires region).
5.         The regulation carried out by the Secretarla de Energla consists of:
(a)  the granting of concessions for electric power supply; and
(b) the approval of electric tariffs.
However, the activity of the Secretarla de Energla is limited as it does not
grant the concession for the installation of nuclear power plants - these are
aut-horized directly by the President of the Republic, and does not approve
the tariffs of the companies owned by the Provincial Governments, nor does it
grant concession for the construction of generating facilities by these
companies.  Also, it has little voice in the decision regarding binational
projects which up to the moment have been made by. the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
6.         Although the Government owns virtually all major generation, transmission
uPl C;-stribution facilities of Argentina, the manner of controlling the various
e,Lities is not uniform (see Attachment 1).  As can be seen, the Secretary
of Energy controls SEGBA, HIDRONOR and AyEE, the Ministry of Foteign Affairs
*o ntrols the Argentine representation in the two binational entities E?Y and
C'.n.'G, the President of Argentina controls CNEA, and the provincial Governments
control the two main provincial electric utilities EPEC and DEBA. In other
words, the organization of this sector is fragmented and it lacks cohesion.
Js a. Lesult a chaotic situation exists in the sector regarding planning and
investment decisions.
Power Sector Planning
i.         A power planning working group, coordinated by the Secretaria de
Frergia, with the participation of representatives of AyEE, SEGBA and CNEA
Las in the past prepared power expansion programs for which a mathematical
rmodel (minimum cost, linear-program) for optimization of generating and
t:ransmission facilities was used. The last version of this program was
prepared in 1975 and covers the years 1976-1986. The basic assumptions for
this study were:
(a) Energy and demand forecast growth at 11.5% p.a. (the historical
average growth for the period 1960-1974 was 8%) a consequence
of assuming that economic activity in Argentina (GNP) would
increase at 7.5% p.a. (the historical growth was 3.5% p.a. for
1960-1970). This projection implies that per capita consumption
would grow from 800 kWh in 1970 to 3,000 kWh in 1985.  No studies
of historical trends per category of consumption, future trends



ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 9 pages
based on regional development forecasts or analyses of
industrialization plans were made.
(b) A system reserve of 22% of installed capacity was used which is
unreasonably high, especially for a system which progressively
will become predominantly hydro.
(c) Not all attractive hydro projects existing in Argentina were
considered nor were reliable cost estimates used.
The final expansion program as prepared in 1975 results in an over-capacity
of 5-10% over and above the system reserve, even with the highly inflated load
forecast described in (a). In other words, the program is highly ambitious and
of questionable economic justification.
8.        As a result of this unjustified expansion program and the fragmented
organization and decision-making structure of the sector, the previous
Government took a number of investment decisions for the sector with little
or no technical or economic justification. The following are examples of
such decision:
(a) In July 1975, the Government signed a contract with Russian,
French aind German manufacturers for the..supply of three steam
mnits of 310 MW each without any study of their necessity and
timing. Unless rapid decisions are made to expand coal production,
these units will have to boil-fired and will add to the balance
of payment problems that Argentina faces.
(b) The previous Government decided to locate Argentina's second nuclear
power plant (640 MW) in the Cordoba region, where no market exists
for the energy produced. As a result, it then decided to build
a pumped storage scheme (Rio Grande 760 MW) to utilize this energy
and to build an interconnection with the Buenos Aires-Litoral
system to export the combined output.  While the interconnection would
probably have been required in the long run, its construction
is premature. The economic return of these three major investments
is probably marginal.
(c)  Agreements have been signed with Paraguay to build the Yacyreta-
Apipe project without a detailed analysis of the necessity and
timing of the project.
In all these cases, the previous Government appears to have been motivated
by political or other non-economic considerations. In no case does it seem
to have addressed the question of whether the project was the least cost
alternative to meeting Argentina's need. for power.
Power Sector Expansion
9.        As a consequence of the decisions already taken by the previous
Government, the main items of generation expansion program of Argentina under
construction at the moment are the following:

10.       Besides the above mentioned projects, several others are in preparation
including:
(a)  La Brava, a pumped storage scheme in the Buenos Aires region of
400 MW initial capacity and a 1,000 MW final capacity, to the
completed (first stage) in 1984.
(b)  Alicura, a hydro power plant of 1,000 MW capacity in the Limang Basin
for which the civil works have already been started but which is
not expected to be commissioned until 1983-1984 due to financial
constraints of HIDRONOR.
(c)  Yacyreta-Apipe, a binational hydroproject between Paraguay and
Argentina on the Parana river with an initial capacity of 1,350 MW
to be extended to 2,700 MW. The final feasibility study is nearly
completed. Another binational project on the Parana river, Corpus
(6,000 MW) is being studied and it already appears to be more
economic solution than Yacyreta-Apipe on a cost/kW installed basis,
due to less complicated civil works. A final decision regarding
the timing of these two projects has yet to be taken by the present
Argentine authorities.
(d)  3 possible binational hydroelectric projects with Brazil on the
river Uruguay have been identified. These are San Pedro, Roncador
and Gavari. Gavari appears the most promising and a feasibility
study is under preparation.

ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 9 pages
(e)  Feasibility studies are being prepared for 4 further hydro projects
in the area of HIDRONOR's concessions, namely:
Piedra del Aguila                          2,100 MW
Collon Cura                                   700 MW
Pichi Piciun Leuf'u                           400 MW
Michinuao                                     600 MW
(f) CNEA is studying the feasibility of building a third nuclear power
plant (Atucha II) of about 1,000 MW to be installed in the
vicinity of the existing Atucha nuclear power plant.
The transmission systems necessary to utilize all these power plants have not
been defined and should be studied.  In the case of the Yacyreta-Apipe
project, AyEE has already decided that transmission to the Buenos Aires region
use direct current, without having carried a comprehensive study to determine
an overall transmission program based on the least-cost solution.
11.        As Attachment 2 shows, this investment program will provide the
interconnected system (Greater Buenos Aires, Litoral, Buenos Aires South, Comahue
and Cordoba - see map 11441R) with an overcapacity until 1985. While a
proper national sales forecast for the power sector has yet to be prepared, the
current authoritie. have made reasonable assumptions as follows:
(a)  growth rates of 0% for 1976, 5% for 1977 and 8% thereafter;
(b)  an extreme case of growth rates of 0% for 1976, 5% in 1977, 8% in 1978
and 10% thereafter.
12.        Two different values of system reserve were considered as follows:
(a)  22% of installed capacity as used by the last version of the
expansion program prepared by Argentina (para. 7);
(b)  the largest steam unit in service (350 MW) plus 20% of installed
capacity until 1979 and 15% thereafter.
Argentine power sector planners have always tended to use high figures for
system reserve due to:
(a)  the high proportion of steam generating units, especially in the
Greater Buenos Aires area, which require more maintenance than
hydro units;
(b)  insufficient maintenance of these steam units due to a historical
lack of generating capacity  .d to labor problems;
(c)  a certain number of very old machines (about 320 MW) installed
in SEGBA's system.
However, as a result of the present availability of power from Atucha and HIDRONOR,
SEGBA and AyEE are carrying out a comprehensive maintenance program which
would leave their generating units in a normal state of availability by 1979-1980.



ANNEX 2
Page 8 of 9 pages
By this same date, the interconnected system will have a much higher proportion
of hydro units, with a considerably higher service reliability and in 1981
the obsolete units will have been dismantled. It appears reasonable therefore
to use the alternative criterion for reserve mentioned above, i.e. 350 MW
plus 20% of installed capacity until 1979 and 15% thereafter.  This will
result in an overall percentage reserve of 19% on a long-term basis which is on
the high side but not unreasonable.
13.       On this basis, it can be seen that even with the high load forecast,
no additional generating capacity is needed until 1986 and that wasteful and
unjustified investments have been decided by the previous Government which
because of their state of advancement cannot be delayed or cancelled. It is
also evident that it would be unjustified to proceed with the projects described
in paragraph 10 (a to f) until a comprehensive and realistic national power
expansion plan has been prepared.
Revaluation of Assets
14.       There is no consistent approach to revaluation of power sector
assets; e.g. SEGBAts concession stipulates using historic US$ value adjusted
only by the effect of the US dollar parity as stipulated by IMF, and other
entities use different methods. The Government intends to carry out a
study to develop proposals for a uniform methodology for revaluation of
assets to enable all the power utilities to maintain uniform and realistic
values of their assets. This study will be included in the sector organization
study. It is estimated that realistic values of the rate base of the different
entities would mean increasing the presently used values by 50 to 100%.
In the case of SEGBA and HIDRONOR this would mean an increase in their
tariffs of about 25% and 40% respectively, if the values of their assets
increase by 50% in order to maintain the 8% rate of return in agreement with
their concessions.
Conclusions
15.       From the above, it can be concluded that:
(a) the Argentine authorities should consider delaying or
cancelling, to the extent feasible, the commitments,until
the expansion program mentioned below is completed;
(b) a national power expansion plan, based on the least-cost program
for expanding generation and transmission should be prepared
as soon as possible; and
(c) a national power sector organization study should be undertaken as
soon as possible to rationalize the sector organization, regulation
and planning.
16.       The Argentine authorities are fully aware of the situation and have
studied the feasibility of delaying as many investment commitments as possible
and have agreed to undertake studies mentioned in (b) and (c). The authorities
have concluded that:



ANNEX 2
Page 9 of 9 pages
(a) the projects under construction (para. 9) are too far advanced to be
cancelled and should be completed, except for Alicura (para. 10 (b))
which will be reviewed in the context of the national power expansion
plan;
(b) All other projects not on international waters will be deferred and
reviewed when the plan is available; and
(c) Projects on international waters will be discussed with Argentina's
partners in order to develop solutions compatible with the interests
of all countries involved.
17.       These power sector studies (sector organization and expansion plan)
should focus on, inter alia, the following aspects:
(a) reasonable criteria for system reserve;
(b) use of indigenous energy resources;
(c) regulation of the sector;
(d) uniform and realistic methodology for asset revaluation;
(e) proposal for a national tariff structure;
(f) reasonable timing of sector investments as a result of an updated
market study;
(g) financing plan for the expansion program; and
(h)  a comprehensive national transmission system.
Power Sector Operation
18.       The present interconnected system (see map 11441R) will be expanded in
1977 when the interconnection between the Cordoba region and the Gran Buenos Aires-
Litoral system is completed. In 1974, the Secretary of Energy, by Resolution
No. 171 determined that the operation of all the entities involved in this
system are subject to the instructions of a centralized load dispatching system -
Despacho de Carga Unificado, DUC - located in Rosario and coordinated by AyEE.
Basically DUC operates as follows:
(a) daily load forecasts (for half-hour periods) of the system are made
one day in advance;
(b) the availability of all the system components (generating units,
transmission circuits, etc.) is determined one day in advance;
(c) based on the incremental generating cost and the availability of
each element of the components, the most economical loading of the
generation and transmission system is determined by computer;
(d) DUC is also responsible for calculating the average monthly power
and energy imported and exported by each interconnected entity for
purposes of billing between utilities.
DUC aims at the optimum use of generation capacity in the interconnected system
and limits the independence of operatio  of the different utilities which might
otherwise lead to an uneconomic operation.
In the other regions of the country, basically controlled by AyEE, no
major interconnection exists and the different isolated systems are operated
independently.

ARGENTINA
GREATER BUENOS AIRES SUBREGION
General
1.           The city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the country, and its
surroundings are served by SEGBA and CIAE. The greater Buenos Aires area
contains 71% of the population of the Buenos Aires - Litoral Region, and
accounts for 70% of the Region's electric consumption. SEGBA's concession
covers an area of 13,586 km2 and includes CIAE's smaller concession area.
In 1975 the main characteristics of the subregion were the following:
Population living in the area:                         9,900,000 inhabitants
Population with access to electricity:                 8,839,000 inhabitants
Number of power consumers:
SEGBA          2,674,700
CIAE              402,500
Total                                      3,077,200 consumers
Sales:
SEGBA               8,834 GWh

system.  The Icad will be covered by SLGBA's own generation and increaeir.. avauntE
of imported plower from other regions.  Th-e following generatior. expar;sic'.s, nc;
underway, are -maore than ample to satisfy SEGBA's requirements:
(a)    HIDRONOR will be able tc use the additional output (400 M0  of its
hydro power station at El Choc6n once the compensating dam at Arroyito
is completed (1977-1978).
(b)    One unit (225 MW) of HIDRONOR's hydro power station at Planicie
Bandeiita will be completed in 1977. The second unit will be
available when the compensating dam is completed in 1981.
(c)    AyEE will commiseion two new steam units of 310 MWy eaclh and one
of 350 MW at its San Nicolas power station between the years 1980-
1982.
(d)    CTMSG will bring on line the first two units (270 MW) of the Salto
Grande hydro station in 1979and further units in 1980 and 1981.
The table also shows the considerable imTprovement in SEGBA's transmission and
distribution losses v.hichl were 20% of sales 1967, and had declined to 16% by
1975, as a result of the systems rehabilitation under the previoue project. It
has been conservatively estimated that a further decline to 14.3% by 1981 would
be achieved under the project. Because of the transmission losses associated
with imported power, it will be difficult to achieve further reductions in the
percentage losses.

APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH BUENOS AIRES POWER PROJECT
SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES (SEGBA)
ARGENTINA
TARIFF REGULATION AND STRUCTURE
Power Tariff Regulation
1.        The tariffs charged by the national enterprises SEGBA,1  HIDRONOR
and AyEE and by the private company CIAE are approved by the Secretarla de
Energ.a in the light of the stipulations of the various Concession Agreements
(SEGBA, HIDRONOR and CIAE) and of Decree No. 404/67 (AyEE). In the case
of the provincial enterprises DEBA and EPEC, tariffs are approved by the
provincial government. Atucha's (CNEA) tariffs are fixed under agreements
with the Secretaria. Both the level and structure of power rates charged
by the different utilities are not uniform.
2.        No uniform procedure exists for revaluing the assets of power
utilities; some itemize their assets in service in US dollars, with adjust-
ments for the dollar parity as stipulated by IMF while others revalue them in
accordance with the general legal provisions on taxation.
3.        The study on sector organization (Annex 2) will include a proposal
for a uniform methodology of asset revaluation and for a national tariff
structure.
SEGBA's Tariffs
4.        Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, provides that SEGBA's
rates should generate revenues sufficient to produce a return of 8% on the
average value, expressed in US dollars, of net plant in service, plus a
notional value of working capital equal to 5% of the average value of net
plant in service. Depreciation charges are computed on the value, also
expressed in dollars, of gross plant in service at year-end, at 3% on all
assets (except furniture and fixtures, 10%; and vehicles, 20%).   These rates
are considered satisfactory; however, since depreciation rates are not
specified in the Concession Agreement, SEGBA and the Government have agreed
to continue charging depreciation at these rates.
5.        According to the terms of Article 14, power rates are revised
annually, effective with the first meter reading of January, on the basis
of a detailed application submitted by SEGBA to the Secretaria de Energfa,
for approval. The Article provides that, if the 8% return to which SEGBA
is entitled has not been achieved (or has been exceeded) in any past year,
1/ See Annex 2 for a description of the entities involved in the power
sector.



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 4 pages
the shortfall (or surplus) must be compensated for by revenues of the year
immediately succeeding. Changes arising in labor and fuel cost during the
year are to be automatically compensated for by interim rate adjustments.
Furthermore, if changes in economic circumstances, such as lower sales,
devaluation of currency, etc., could be expected to result in an insuf-
ficient earnings for the current year, SEGBA can adjust its rates propor-
tionally after informing the Secretar'a.
6.        In 1969 SEGBA earned more than 8% and so, in accordance with
Article 14, rates were reduced by 1.3% effective January 1, 1970, to
compensate for the excess earnings. This was the last time that the
Article was observed. SEGBA has failed to earn its stipulated 8% return
since 1970 and, although it submitted applications for rate adjustments in
accordance with Article 14, the Government did not grant the full increase
requested. The provisions which call for recovery of prior years' short-
falls and automatic rate increases to offset rising costs, were not applied.
Tariff Levels
7.        When the new Government came into power in March 1976, it immediately
took action to impLove the financial situation of the public sector enterprises
which had all experienced operating deficits in 1975 as a result of the
unrealistic price policies of the previous Government. A 10% monthly increase
of SEGBA's tariffs was applied starting in April 1976 with an additional 20%
increase in July. The Government intends to continue with this 10% monthly
accumulative increase until December 1976 with perhaps and additional 20%
increase in September or October 1976. Additional increases in 1977-1979 would
be applied to permit SEGBA to cover higher costs of fuel and purchased power
(para. 2.14) and obtain a 9% rate of return in 1977-1979 in order to recover
past earnings shortfalls.  After 1979, the rate of return would be 8% and
the average selling price per kWh including sales taxes will be about 4.8US4
(in end-1976 US$). The analysis in Annex 7 shows that this would be somewhat
higher than the long-term marginal cost.
Tariff Structure
8.        The general pattern of relative price levels for the categories
shown below appears reasonable, as it contemplates the highest price level
for commercial consumption, followed by large residential consumption, large
industrial consumption and, finally, a lower level of "social" price corre-
sponding to the smaller residential consumers. To increase unit price
progressively with consumption for residential consumers seems appropriate
as it discourages waste and increases the participation of the high income
groups in the financing of the power s '.vice.  The relatively high level of
tariffs for commercial consumers, has, however, created problems, since
consumers try to avoid being classified in this category, and a rather
elaborate "reglamento" had to be introduced for this purpose. There would
appear to be a good case for introducing a somewhat more elaborate   tariff
structure for medium-sized industrial and commercial users (i.e. of less



ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 4 pages
than 50 kW connected capacity) which would include some incentives for
accepting supply at higher voltage and for off-peak consumption. There
also appears to be a need for strengthening these incentives in Tariff
No. 5; only 12% of SEGBA's sales are currently at mid-tension, and 6%
at high-tension. The Government and SEGBA intend to carry out a tariff
study which would take into account the above recommendations. Table
No. 1 shows the average price (with and without taxes) at July 1976 and
December 1976 for typical consumption.
Tariff Schedules
9.        The SEGBA tariff structure as per July 1, 1976, covers 7 categories
which are shown below. The main categories of the tariff schedule are:
Tariff 1 for residential consumers
Tariff 2 for commercial and small industrial consumers
Tariff 5 for large consumers (over 50 kW connected)
The remaining 4 categories relate to public lighting, Government, electric
traction (Buenos Aires underground) and public water pumping services.

Page 2 of 3 pages
The breakdown between foreign and local cost of the project works,
shown in para. 4.05 of the text, is based on the following assumptions:
(a) 65% of all equipment would be purchased from local manufacturers.
This percentage is lower than that obtained in SEGBA's third
power project (80%) because local industry has little or no
experience in 500 kV techniques.
(b) The average price difference between local and foreign bids was
estimated at 12.5%, in line with SEGBA's past experience.
(c) The average indirect foreign component of goods manufactured
locally was estimated at 60%, following the results of studies
carried out by SEGBA.
II - Studies to be carried out by the Government with the assistance of
consultants (para. 2.13)
1. A national power sector organization study to rationalize sector planning,
financing and operation.
2. The study of a national power expansion plan based on the least cost program
for expanding generation and transmission which would incorporate, inter alia,
acceptable criteria for establishing system reserves and recommendations for
the expansion of coal production for power generation.
The estimated unit cost of consulting services as shown below is
based on market prices for services of individual experts of high calibre
required for the type of work to be performed in the carrying out of a
national power expansion plan and a national power sector organization study.
This cost is substantially higher than the average cost per man-month of
regular engineering studies of the sort where a large number of individuals
of different professional levels are required.

JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
I. ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION PROGRAM
Required Distribution Capacity (mid and low-tension)
1.         The distribution expansion program is based on load studies for
individual substations. To verify that the overall capacity figures are
reasonable, an analysis was made on the basis of the overall system demand
and energy loss projections shown in Annex 3. The annual and projected
peak demand data in Annex 3 are at the feeding points of SEGBA's system.
In order to determine the required capacity for the distribution system
(mid and low-tension) it is necessary to estimate the demand at the 13.2 kV
side of the distribution substations. To do this it is necessary to translate
energy losses into an equivalent peak demand loss. This peak demand loss
must then be divided between the low-tension portion of the network and the
rest of the system. The required distribution capacity is then estimated
on basis of a diversity factor of 1.3 and a reserve capacity of 20%, resulting
in a capacity of 1.56 times power demand.
Peak Demand Loss
2.         From the annual energy losses, which are shown in Annex 3, table 1,
and the annual load duration curve, the load factor of losses was calculated.
for the expected annual load factor of 0.56 arriving to a load factor of
losses of 0.38.
The power losses (MW) expressed in percentage of peak demand will be:
0.56
0.38 x % energy losses = about 1.5 x % energy losses
High-Tension Losses
3.         These are estimated at 30% of the total losses and the power losses
for the high-tension system would therefore be 1.50 x 0.3 = 0.45 times the
total % of energy losses of the system.

5.    By end-1975 SEGBA had installed 3818 MVA of distribution transformer
capacity and expects to install 214 MVA during 1976, bringing the total by
end-1976 to 4032 MVA. The project includes the installation of 884 MVA of
distribution transformer capacity of which about 15%, i.e. about 133 MVA
can be assigned to rehabilitation and 85%, i.e. 751 MVA to serve the load
growth requirements. These percentages are in line with SEGBA's past experience.
Under these conditions the final capacity of distribution transformers in 1981
would be 4032 plus 751 MVA, i.e. 4783 MVA which coincides very closely with
the projected capacity required in 1981 (see para 4.) of 4794 MVA.
Unit Cost
6.    The total cost (base plus physical contingency) for the distribution
expansion and rehabilitation component of the project is US$154.3 million (mid-
1976 prices). The unit cost is therefore US$175/kVA which is reasonable.
1/ Related to the energy delivered to the system (Annex 3).

II.   Costs - Benefits Equalizing Return
Basis of Calculation
7.        All costs were evaluated at mid-1976 levels and then estimated in
end-1976 prices by adding a price escalation of 4.5%. Local costs were
calculated in local currency and converted at the free rate of exchange of
lUS$1250$a.  Shadow pricing of foreign exchange and other project imports was
not deemed necessary.
Incremiental Energy Sold During the Project Period
8.        The expansion of the distribution system contemplated in the project,
corresponds to the load growth in the four-year period 1978-1981, while
maintaining a reasonable standard of service. Based on the sales shown in
Annex 3, the incremental energy for the period will be:
Year                            GWh
1978                 10,000 - 9,351 = 749
1979                 10,907 - 9,351 = 1,556
1980                 11,781 - 9,351 = 2,430
1981                 12,725 - 9,351 = 3,374
1982 onwards                3,374
Benefits
9.        It has been assumed that the benefits obtained from the project
correspond to the value of electric energy used by the ultimate consumer minus
the marginal cost of the energy supplied to SEGBA's transmission and distribution
systems. The benefits of electricity to the consumers should at least be equal
to the price (including sale taxes) paid by them. This price, after all future
tariff adjustments for bulk purchases by SEGBA and final fuel prices (see para.
2.14) converted to end-1976 values was calculated to be 0.0482 US$/kWh (average
sales price per kWh).
As SEGBA is not planning to expand its installed generating capacity
(the new 310 MW unit (para. 4.01) is assumed to replace obsolete equipment which
will be eliminated) all incremental energy for SEGBA's system will be purchased
from bulk suppliers such as HIDRONOR, CTMSG, and CNEA with a small proportion
from the San Nicolas steam power plant of AyEE. Ideally the internal rate of
return calculation would specifically incorporate incremental costs for
generation, transmission and distribution.  However, in the absence of adequate
iiLvfrmation of incremental costs for generation and transmaission in Argentina
a slightly different approach has therefore been used. As a proxy for incremental
cost, energy costs were calculated as follows:



ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 5 pages
The cost of energy was evaluated under the conditions explained
in (para. 2.14) i.e. costs corresponding to reasonable rates of return and
fuel prices, and when expressed in end-1976 values was found to be 0.0174 US$/kWh.
The net value of benefits is therefore:
0.0482 - 0.0174 = 0.0.308 US$/kWh
It is not possible to estimate exactly the allocation of the
incremental energy shown in para. 8 between the project and existing facilities.
As an approximation, it was assumed that the project would contribute 40% in
1978, 60% in 1979, 80% in 1980, 90% in 1981 and a 100% thereafter. The total
benefits would therefore be:

Marginal Operating and Maintenance Cost
11.       Present cost of operation, maintenance and administration for SEGBA's
transmission and distribution system is approximately 6% of investment. Together
with SEGBA's technical staff, an evaluation was carried out to determine the
marginal operating maintenance and administration cost of the transmission and
distribution systems and it was found that this would be approximately 3% of
marginal investment. For the purpose of calculating the rate of return of the
project a conservative value of 3.5% was assumed to take into account any
possible increases in real terms of salary levels in Argentina. On this basis
the 0 and M costs for the different years are:

Sensitivity Analysis
13.       If investment and operating costs are assumed to rise by 10% the rate
of return would be 18.5%. If the cost of incremental energy purchased by SEGBA
were to rise by 20%., net benefit would decrease by 11% to 0,0273 US$/kWh, and
the rate of return would still be 18.3%. This could be the case under the
following circumstances:
(a) fuel prices were to increase in real terms by a larger factor
than assumed;
(b) net assets of Hidronor and/or CNEA were calculated based on
replacement value instead of historical costs and tariffs
adjusted accordingly, or
(c)  the price paid by SEGBA to CTMSG were higher than the price paid
to Hidronor. (In the calculation of the rate of return it was
assumed that all hydro energy to be purchased would cost 0,0176
US$/kWh, which corresponds to an 8% rate of return for Hidronor
on assets valued in US$ at historical costs.)
If the cost of this incremental energy would rise by 40%, net benefit
would decrease by 23% to 0,0238 US$/kWh, and the rate of return would be 15.3%.
Since the above rates of return exceed the probable opportunity cost
of capital in Argentina, they suggest that wasteful use of electricity and
premature expansion of SEGBA's system would be avoided, as consumers will, on
the average, be requested to pay a price higher than marginal systems costs.
Project Timing
14.       The possibility of postponing the project for one year was evaluated
by computing the discount rate which equalizes the savings in investment and
operating costs which would result with the benefits that would be lost. Since
this rate is above 21% it would not be economic to postpone the project.

NOTES ON INCOME STATEMENTS
1.        SEGBA's income statements for the period 1973-75 are rendered
difficult to interpret by the country's high inflation -(31%, 36% and 349%
at the end of each year) and the existence of exchange controls. They have
been converted into US dollars at the exchange rate applicable on December 31
each year (1973 and 1974 lUS$/9.98$a; 1975 lUS$/60.97$a).
2.        The 1976 income statement has been estimated in pesos month by
month in anz attempt to eliminate distortions caused by inflation. The
total for the year has been converted to US dollars at the estimated average
exchange rate of the year, (lUS$/200$a).  The projected income statements for
the year 1977 are based on the December 1976 figures converted into US dollars
at the estimated rate of exchange at that date, i.e. $a250/lUS$. The following
years have been estimated directly in US dollars. Interest on local currency
loans has been calculated at the average estimated exchange rate for each
year (1977 lUS$/300$a; 1978 lUS$/400$a; 1979 lUS$/520$a; 1980 lUS$/680$a; and
1981 lUS$/880$a).
3.        The 1975 income statement has been adjusted in accordance with the
Concession Agreement of February 1, 1962. In December 1975, the former
management of SEGBA began proceedings to amend the Concession Agreement. Amend-
ments were made by SEGBA and the Secretarla de Energla (but not approved by the
other competent authorities) to Articles 13 and 14, which had provided that
the value of plant in service and depreciation reserves should be itemized in
US dollars at the free exchange rate, while Article 15, laying down norms for the
US$ parity as stipulated by IMF, was eliminated. The proposed Concession provided that
the value of plant in service and depreciation reserves held as of January 1,
1975, be converted to pesos at the financial exchange rate applicable on that
date ($a 9.98 to US$1). Thereafter, the values in question were to be adjusted
in step with the cost-increase indexes fixed by the Directorate General of
Taxation. SEGBA's new management stated that the amendments to the Concession
Agreement had in fact not been approved and that they would continue to apply
the provisions of the 1962 Concession Agreement. Study of an appropriate
procedure for revaluing assets forms part of the general study on sector
organization (Annex 2). While the study is in progress, the best solution seems
to be that of leaving assets values in US dollars owing to the fact that the
Government intends to maintain realistic exchange rates.
4.        Operating costs have increased substantially since 1971 owing mainly
to inflation and the devaluation of the peso. The SEGBA Concession provides
that higher costs attributable to inflation and devaluation should be covered
by rate increases calculated to maintain the authorized rate of return (8%).
From 1970 on, rate increases did not match cost increases, so that SEGBA
income fell steadily. Since April 1976, sizeable rate increases have been
introduced (see Annex 4). SEGBA is expected to achieve an 8% return (on an
annualized basis) in December 1976.
5.        These taxes are surcharges collected by SEGBA for account of the
federal, provincial and municipal authorities. They represent approximately
18% of the basic rate and comprise the following:



ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 4 pages
a)   Fondo Nacional de la Energia Electrica, federal tax of
$a 0.003 per kWh sold (Law 15336 of September 20, 1960, and Law 16656 of
December 30, 1964).
b)   Fondo Chocon-Cerros Colorados, 5% federal tax on all sales
to final consumers (Law 17574 and Decree 8054 of December 17, 1968).
c)   Fondo Grandes Obras Electricas, 5% federal tax on all sales
(Law 19287 of October 5, 1975, and Decree 5941 of December 15, 1971).
d)   Fondo Desarrollo Electrico de la Provincia de Buenos Aires,
provincial tax of 20% on industrial and commercial consumers and 4% on
residential consumers in the province (Provincial Law 7290 of July 20,
1967 and Provincial Law 8016 of March 7, 1973).
e)   Fondo Especial Central La Brava, provincial tax of $a 0.0625
per kWh sold in Buenos Aires province (Provincial Law 8372 of March 20, 1975).
f)   Federal Capital Consumer Tax, tax of 1.5% on industrial and
commercial consumers and 1% on residential consumers in the federal capital
(Buenos Aires City Tariff Order).
Certain sales are exempt from some of these taxes (those made to
the railways and subway, government agencies and subscribers consuming less
than 70 kWh per month).
6.        This adjustment is made in SEGBA accounts to reflect the revenues
of the year on a basis of consumption rather than billing. It represents
the difference between the estimated value of energy billed during the last
part of the year and the corresponding estimate at the end of the previous
year. This adjustment has not been projected in the forecast for 1976 through
1981, since it would not materially affect the forecasts.
7.        Expenditure on salaries, wages and social benefits for 1976 has
been estimated on the basis of present figures plus a possible 15% increment
in September.  The payroll as of December 1976 was used as a basis for
projecting 1977-81 expenses in US dollars as follows:
1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981
Number of employees (thousands)   26.3   25.0   23.8   22.8   23.3   23.8   24.3

Personnel costs, which amounted to 45.8% of total operating costs in 1975, will
fall to 19.2% by 1981 owing to the fact that cost of other inputs - mainly
fuel and purchased energy will increase.
8.        Fuel prices (see para. 2.14) have been projected to reach 75-80% of



ANNEX 8
Page 4 of 4 pages
the international price by December 1978.
9.        The price of energy bought by SEGBA has been calculated according
to the following criteria:
a)   Between late  1976 and late 1977, HIDRONOR rates will be
increased gradually to the point where income covers operating costs including
sinking fund depreciation and gives the rate of return laid down in its
Concession Agreement (8% on net fixed assets valued in US$).
b)   Rates for the output of the Atucha nuclear power plant (CNEA)
will be increased gradually so that by late 1977 income will cover operating
costs (including fuel costs at international prices) and give an 8% rate of
return on investment valued in US dollars.
c)   The price of thermal energy purchased from AyEE and CIAE will
be increased progressively and in step with fuel prices (see note 8).
10.       The Concession Agreement provides that, in lieu of income and all
other taxes, SEGBA shall pay two taxes on sales, one to the municipalities
and the other to the province of Buenos Aires. The municipal tax of 6% -
on all sales except to railways and for public lighting - is set off quarterly
against the power bills of municipalities. The provincial tax of 6%. - on
sales in the province to the same categories of consumers as the municipal
tax - is set off from time to time, by ad hoc arrangements, against the
province's power bills.
11.       Other expenses have been estimated at 21% of the salaries, wages
and social benefits, which is somewhat higher than the long-term trend, not
in line with 1976 actual experience.
12.       Depreciation of utility plant in service is charged at one single
rate of 3%, applied to the dollar value of the aggregate plant, rather than
at different rates applying to the different classes of assets. Depreciation
of assets other than utility plant, which are also valued in dollars and
represent together a relatively insignificant proportion of the fixed assets,
is charged at 10% for furniture and fixtures and 20% for automobiles, trucks,
etc.
13.       SEGBA capitalizes interest at the rate of 8% of average work in
progress.
14.       The rate base has been set in accordance with the terms of the
Concession Agreement (see Annex 4).
15.       Tariffs have been projected to achieve the 8% rate of return
allowed under the Concession and recover part of the earning shortfall during
1977, 1978 and 1979 (para. 6.10).

NOTES ON BALANCE SHEETS
1.        Balance sheets for 1973, 1974 and 1975 have been converted into
US dollars at the exchange rate applicable on December 31 each year except for
plant in service and depreciation, which are shown at their US dollar value
under the terms of the Concession Agreement. The 1975 balance sheet has been
adjusted according to the terms of the Concession (see note 3, Annex 8), while
the value of works in progress has been converted to dollars at the monthly
exchange rates (resulting weighted average rate of lUS$/24.3$a) with subsequent
correction of capital and reserves.
2.        The exchange rate used for 1976 is 1US$/250$a, except for works in
progress, for which expected monthly exchange rates (resulting in a weighted
average rate of lUS$/168$a) are taken. Other years were estimated directly
in US$.
3.        Accounts receivable for energy sales as of December 31, 1975, are as
follows:

Private consumers                               22.1          1,348.4

Sub-total                                   38.6          2,351.4
Unbilled Energy                                  33.7         2,054.0
Provision for doubtful debts                      0.3             15.0
Net Accounts Receivable for Energy Sales         72.0         4,390.4
Unbilled Energy includes estimated amounts sold in December which would,
under SEGBA's bimonthly hilling cycle, be billed in January at the higher
January tariff. This tends to distort the ratio of receivables to annual
sales in periods of rapidly rising tariffs such as 1975-76. Provincial and
municipal taxes and surcharges are offset periodically against the corresponding
power bills.
4.        In order to increase its use of coal, SEGBA converted two of its
boilers to coal consumption. The investment, made by SEGBA itself, is excluded
from the rate base and will be paid off over 30 years. This part of the plant
cannot be operated owing to delays in the expansion of coal producing capacity
(see Annex 1) and is therefore considered as a deferred asset.
5.        See Annex 10 for details of long-term loans contracted for as of
December 31, 1975. The following terms have been assumed for the loans from
foreign and local banks connected with the project and needed to fund works
scheduled for commencement in 1980: maturity, seven years (including one year
of grace); interest, 11%.

6.        Current liabilities as of December 1975 included US$23.1 million
owing to the federal, provincial and municipal governments in respect of the
special funds collected by SEGBA. In mid 1976, SEGBA began payment of the
funds collected during the year. Current liabilities also include obligations
pending for energy purchases amounting to US$8.1 million; payment of these
has also begun.
