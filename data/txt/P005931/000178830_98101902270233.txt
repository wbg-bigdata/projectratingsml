REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC FOR AN
ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires S.A. (SEGBA) with the Guarantee
of the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$115 million to help finance
an electric transmission and distribution program in the Greater Buenos Aires
area. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3 vears of grace.
with interest at 8.9% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Argentina" (540b-AR) dated February 20, 1975, was distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors. An updating economic memorandum has been completed recently
and is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Argentina is endowed with a favorable human and natural resource
base and enjoys a relatively high GDP per capita, which reached almost US$1,600
in 1975. However, it is by no means fully developed and its income level
masks deep-seated structural imbalances in the economy, manifested in its in-
ability to attain stable growth. Argentina has so far failed to develop a
sufficiently productive and internationally competitive industrial structure.
It has attempted to maintain, however, comparatively high levels of income and
consumption in the urban sector. This has been done in part by price, income
and subsidy policies which, in effect, transferred income from the agricul-
tural to the urban sector. Lacking adequate incentives, the agricultural
sector has produced and exported less than would be expected. In addition to
the urban-rural conflict, there has been a clash of interests between the
industrial and agricultural entrepreneurs on the one hand and the demands of
a large mass of well organized employees and workers on the other. These
social and economic tensions have made it difficult to pursue rational economic
policies for any considerable period of time. Unsatisfactory economic results
have, in turn, led to frustrated expectations and thus exacerbated the social
tensions. The present government is attempting to break this "vicious circle."
4.        Although Argentina's economic development in recent decades has been
characterized by a "stop-go" syndrome, the economic and financial chaos of

1975/76 was virtually without precedent in the country's history. The annual
rate of inflation which reached 355% in 1975, accelerated to an annual rate
of about 1,000% during the first quarter of 1976. The last few months of the
previous administration saw a total breakdown of economic management which
propelled the nation toward hyperinflation and created a serious danger of
default on its external obligations. The military forces which had been
hesitant to displace the elected authorities finally took the reins of govern-
ment on March 24, 1976.
The Government's Short-Term Program
5.        The economic and financial chaos inherited by the military government
when it came to power in March 1976 dictated in large measure the priorities
of its actions. The most urgent tasks before the authorities were to halt
hyperinflation and to preclude default on its international financial obliga-
tions. Since inflationary expectations manifested themselves in a flight
from the peso and the consequent skyrocketing of the free market exchange rate,
the authorities took prompt action to alter this pernicious situation. To
contain the growth of the money supply and reduce the velocity of circulation,
the authorities raised interest rates and intensified the use of indexed
government bonds. With a view to further strengthening the peso, the author-
ities have permitted an ever increasing proportion of export transactions to
be made at the free foreign exchange market rate and a US$300 million short-
term credit from U.S. and European banks was arranged. In addition, the
authorities successfully rolled over about US$350 million of payments due on
public sector obligations from the second to the last quarter of 1976. These
measures resulted in a sharp drop in the free exchange rate from 380 pesos
per dollar to 240-250 pesos within one month, indicating initial success in
lowering inflationary expectations and halting capital flight.
6.        In pursuit of further deceleration of inflation, the authorities
undertook the twin task of breaking the wage-price spiral and eliminating
price controls which had led to a distortion of relative prices and para-
doxically fueled inflation by generating widespread scarcities. To break
the wage-price spiral, the authorities instituted on a temporary basis a
procedure whereby they preempted the sole right to grant wage increases.
Wages may not be increased except as decreed by the government. Adoption
of such a strong incomes policy led to a continuation of the downward trend
in real wages which ensued in the latter part of 1975 and early 1976, as
nominal wage increases failed to keep pace with price rises and mounting
scarcities of goods. A 15% wage increase was authorized in June and another
of 12% for September. By May 1976, when real wages reached their lowest
level, it is estimated that they were approximately 80% of the average for
1971-75. Indications are that since June real wages have improved somewhat.
The combined effect of the decline in the free exchange rate and the change
in incomes policy produced the intended deceleration of inflation. The first
major slowdown occurred in May, when the cost-of-living index increased by
13% as compared with 38% in March, and it further dropped to 2.9% in June.
In spite of additional increases in prices of public sector services insti-
tuted in July, the rate of inflation was only 4.2% that month, which was



- 3 -
well within the limits to maintain overall price increases of around 5%
monthly by year-end.
7.        The present authorities have recognized that sound management of
public finances is the cornerstone of any successful campaign against hyper-
inflation. In large measure the debilitating events in the economy were
brought about by a rapid deterioration in public sector finances culminating
in March 1976 with four-fifths of the budget being financed by the Central
Bank. Rehabilitation of public finances will require three basic elements:
(i) restoration of the real value of tax revenues; (ii) adjustment in prices
of public sector enterprises; and (iii) reduction in public expenditures. To
achieve the first objective the Government has indexed many tax liabilities
and thereby removed any incentive to postpone payments. Moreover, a decelera-
tion in inflation should by itself remove the advantage associated with
deferred tax payments. In addition to relying on these fundamental factors,
the authorities have raised the most important value-added tax from 13 to 16%,
have reinstated the high-yielding provincial turnover tax at 1.6% and increased
the provincial property tax with a view to reducing budgetary transfers to the
provinces, have undertaken a reassessment of urban and rural property, have
reinstated the levy on capital of enterprises as well as enacted a number of
other minor tax measures. With respect to state economic enterprises, the
Government has adopted a program of phased increases in prices of publicly
produced goods and services. As a first step, transportation and electricity
rates were raised. Further substantial price adjustments were made in almost
all other public enterprises with an effective weighted average increase of
70% between March and September. On the expenditure side, savings are being
achieved in the largest expenditure category of salaries by both reducing the
payrolls padded in recent years and through an emergency reduction of, real
wages of public sector employees. Provided the badly debilitated tax adminis-
tration structure is promptly rehabilitated, the Treasury deficit should be
reduced to 7% of GDP in 1976, compared to over 12% in 1975.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
8.        The recessionary trend, which began in the second half of 1975 and
continued into the first quarter of 1976, does not appear to have been
seriously exacerbated by the Government's stabilization program. GDP which
had fallen in the last quarter of 1975 to a level almost 7% below that of the
previous year is now estimated to decline by 4% this year. It appears that
during the second quarter of this year the economy has been experiencing a
large-scale inventory liquidation phase. Producers, wholesalers, retailers
and even households which previously had hoarded goods in preference to money
were finding the practice too expensive with the cost of money greatly Pxceed-
ing its depreciation and were rapidly dishoarding. This explains in part the
tenfold drop in the rate of inflation between March and June. It appears
reasonable to expect that the stabilization measures, which are introducing
a semblance of order to the economy and have provided a strong impetus to
exports, will also serve as a basis for revival of GDP growth in 1977.



- 4 -
9.        Argentina's balance of payments is beginnning to show signs of
improvement after a disastrous year in 1975, when recorded export earnings
fell by over 20%. The drop was due to not only the closing of the EEC market
for meat, but also to export taxes and to smuggling stimulated by the large
spread between the official and the free market exchange rate. Whereas the
volume of wheat exports is expected to nearly double this year, little imme-
diate improvement is expected in total foreign exchange earnings from grain
exports because of generally lower prices than last year and a poor corn crop.
Most other export categories, however, are already showing signs of recovery.
Beef export volume is about double the level of 1975, although still substan-
tially below the 1972 peak. The EEC is now permitting beef imports pari passu
with its own sales from stock. The volume of manufactured exports has also
increased noticeably, surpassing the 1974 level. Overall, the Government is
projecting an increase in export earnings of about 20% this year over 1975, to
US$3.6 billion, which should stimulate the economy. Imports are expected to
decline from US$4 billion in 1975 to US$3.3 billion this year, reflecting
depressed economic activity in industry, drawdowns of stocks accumulated in
1975 and removal of incentives to overinvoice imports by a realistic exchange
rate. The increase in export earnings and reduction of import payments should
produce a swing of over US$1,370 million in the resource balance, from a
deficit of US$900 million in 1975 to a surplus of US$470 million in 1976.
Factor payments are, however, expected to increase because of high interest
payments and a current account deficit of about US$100 million is forecast for
the year. In addition, because of large payments due on capital account, a
substantial overall balance-of-payments deficit is projected for 1976.
10.       The prospects are favorable for Argentina's attaining and sustaining
considerably higher growth rates than in the past if the economic authorities
can persist in their program of economic reform and reconstruction. The first
phase of the program has necessarily stressed stabilization measures with an
immediate impact. During the next two or three years, growth rates are likely
to be modest as the authorities must emphasize a rebuilding of depleted inter-
national reserves and reduction in the presently excessive level of short-term
debt so economic policies will not be so vulnerable to even comparatively
minor fluctuations in external circumstances. These measures must be accompa-
nied by a strengthening of public sector finances and corrections in the struc-
ture of costs and prices which are needed to stimulate economic efficiency and
growth. After the end of the first phase of the program the major tasks for
the economic management include the adjustment of both industry and agricul-
ture to the new conditions and opportunities, as well as putting in place the
infrastructure needed to support expanded output. The levels of international
trade--which have been low for an economy of Argentina's resource endowment
and economic size--are expected to expand significantly as the economy adjusts
to the more open economic policies. It will take a number of years and conti-
nuing large capital inflows to carry out these tasks, partly because of their
inherent complexity and partly because public support needed to maintain the
effort can be sustained only if social costs of the adjustment process are
minimized. The inflows of medium and long-term capital from both private and
official sources will play essential supporting roles in this process.



- 5-
Debt Service and Creditworthiness
11.       The spectre of default on external debt, which seemed imminent at
the beginnning of the year, has been dispelled by a mammoth funding operation.
The Government upon taking office secured a US$300 million 180-day loan from
commercial banks and had rolled over about US$350 million of payments due on
public sector debts from the second to the fourth quarter of this year. It
has obtained a standby credit from the IMF of SDR260 million (about US$300
million). This includes the first credit tranche of about US$180 million to
be used this year, and about US$120 million or two-thirds of the second credit
tranche for next year's availability. On the basis of the stand-by, the
Government is currently negotiating with commercial banks in the U.S., Canada,
Europe and Japan for a medium-term loan and expects to conclude shortly an
agreement for US$870 million with a four-year maturity. These loans and
credits, although needed to make payments on the previously short-term bank
borrowing and the rollovers, should nevertheless strengthen Argentina's
foreign exchange position and further improve confidence in the peso. More-
over, since the loans and credits from the banks are of a medium-term character,
they represent a step toward an improvement in the external debt structure.
12.       Argentina's debt management problems result from the maturity
structure more than from the level of its external debt. The latter is not
excessively high. It is estimated that public and publicly guaranteed debt
outstanding and disbursed was US$3.2 billion at the end of 1975. Private
external debt amounted to roughly US$3.8 billion, of which "swaps" with a
maturity of six months constituted US$1.3 billion, and short-term import
financing, also with a six-month maturity, US$1.5 billion. The latter in
large measure is revolving in character and normally excluded from medium- and
long-term debt figures. However, almost one-third of the outstanding public
debt and almost one-half of the private debt outstanding at the end of 1975
falls due during 1976. Over 70% of the total falls due within four years.
This maturity structure constitutes a serious challenge to sound monetary
and foreign exchange reserve management and will require realignment. The
external public debt service ratio during the current year is estimated to
reach 24%. Despite expected net borrowing averaging $250 million annually
in 1976-79, the public debt service ratio should decline to about 19% in 1979
and 16% in 1980 because of the improvement in the terms structure and the
expected increases in exports. Provided the authorities successfully imple-
ment their policies of reconstructing the economy and manage the external
indebtedness along the above indicated lines, debt service should not prove
unduly burdensome. Under the circumstances, Argentina should be able to
service the external borrowing required for economic rehabilitation.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA
Bank Operations
13.       As a result of concerns about creditworthiness, along with delays
and difficulties in arriving at agreements on specific projects, past Bank
lending to Argentina has been sporadic. Since 1961, Argentina has received
nine loans from the Bank amounting to US$532.3 million, of which four have
not been fully disbursed. After the first two loans were made in 1961/62 no
loans were made until 1967. In the 1967 to 1969 period, five loans were made
totalling US$233.3 million. The last two Bank loans to Argentina were made
in 1971. The proposed loan would mark a resumption of lending to Argentina
after a hiatus of over five years. The Bank has made four loans for the
power sector, four loans for the transportation sector and one loan for
livestock development. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
as of July 31, 1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       The Bank held 11% of Argentina's total medium- and long-term external
debt at the end of 1975 (excluding financial credits). Service on Bank debt
is approximately 3% of Argentina's total public debt service and Bank loans to
Argentina constitute about 3% of the Bank portfolio.
15.       In its past and projected lending to Argentina, the Bank has sup-
ported and hopes to continue to support several important development object-
ives. The first is institutional development and policy reform which will
ensure that public savings are used economically. This has been an important
objective in the power sector where the Bank has supported management reforms
and a tariff structure which, while socially acceptable, furnishes adequate
rates of return on invested capital. The proposed project supports the
government's efforts to achieve these objectives. In lending for livestock
development our loan has served to introduce modern methods of ranch manage-
ment, within the framework of a supervised agricultural credit program.
16.       A second lending objective is to support projects designed to increase
Argentina's export capacity. Argentina's past economic policies have produced
a low level of participation in the international economy relative to the
country's economic resources. While policy changes, such as agricultural
sector pricing, will provide much of the initial stimulus to increasing exports,
sustained growth will also require an expansion of productive facilities and
infrastructure, in order to eliminate the main development constraint, i.e., the
frequently recurring balance-of-payments crisis. The ongoing livestock develop-
ment and the proposed grain storage projects support this objective. Proposed
future lending in the transport sector aims at eliminating bottlenecks for the
export of agricultural commodities. The proposed loan to SEGBA would help
facilitate the expansion of industrial capacity in the greater Buenos Aires
area where most of Argentina's export industries are located.



- 7 -
17.       Finally Bank lending to Argentina has helped provide necessary
long-term external capital during times when these could be absorbed effec-
tively within the framework of a sound overall financial plan. Investment
requirements have grown steeply as a result of the neglect of the past. Even
with a major effort, public sector savings will fall short of the necessary
levels. This creates a substantial gap in the Government's financial program
which can only be filled by external borrowing. Private sources, however, are
not now prepared to offer Argentina financing in sufficient amount appropriate
terms. It will take some years of successful economic management for Argentina
to establish its position as a substantial borrower of long-term capital in
private markets. During this process the Bank hopes to serve as a catalyst to
stimulate lending from other sources as well as to directly provide a part of
the needed inflow.
18.       We are working with the Argentines on the preparation of further
projects. A project for improvement and development of highways, which are
important for agricultural exports, has been appraised. The Government has
under preparation a project for grain storage and related facilities. Pros-
pects for increased grain exports are favorable and such a project should help
remove existing bottlenecks constraining the Government's efforts to increase
exports. The Government is also preparing an industrial credit project to
support the modernization and expansion of industry in general and particularly
of export-oriented industries.
IFC Operations
19.       IFC has made ten loans to borrowers in Argentina totalling US$51.2
million, and one equity investment of US$2.0 million, of which US$28.6 million
has been repaid, cancelled or sold. A summary of IFC's investments up to
July 31, 1976, is given in Annex II.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Bank Financing in the Sector
20.       The Bank has made four previous loans to the power sector in
Argentina totalling US$292 million. The first loan to SEGBA in the amount
of US$95 million was made in January 1962 to complete a 600 MW thermal gene-
rating station and expand the transmission and distribution systems in Buenos
Aires metropolitan area. The second loan to SEGBA of US$55 million in
January 1968 enabled it to continue the expansion of its generation, trans-
mission and distribution facilities. A third loan of US$82 million was made
to HIDRONOR, a Government-owned corporation, in December 1968 for hydroelectric
power generation. In January 1973, the agreement for this loan was amended to
expand the project to include additional generating facilities. The fourth
Bank loan to the power sector and the third to SEGBA for US$60 million was
made in November 1969 to help SEGBA continue the expansion of its transmission
and distribution facilities through 1972. The physical execution of the proj-
ects financed by the Bank has been satisfactory.



-8-
General Energy Policy
21.       In 1975, petroleum and natural gas accounted for 85% of total primary
energy consumption in Argentina. The Government plans to reduce this propor-
tion by expanding the production of hydroelectricity, nuclear energy and
possibly coal. The electric power sector could make an important contribution
to this objective, since the possibilities of substitution of petroleum in
other major energy-consuming sectors are limited. Argentina's hydroelectric
potential at 45,000 MW is sizeable but only some 4% of this resource has
been developed. Projects totalling an additional 8% are under construction.
Coal could also become an important source of energy, especially for power
generation. The Government intends to decide shortly on the investment
program necessary to increase production so as to permit the switching of
some existing and future thermal plants from oil to coal. At present Argentina
imports about 11% of its petroleum and 15% of its natural gas requirements
at a cost of about US$450 million in 1976. The Government intends to try
to make the country self-sufficient by intensifying the exploration and
production of oil and natural gas through the award of exploration contracts
to international firms.
Power Market
22.       At present 80% of the Argentine population have access to electric
service. In 1975, the per capita consumption was 991 kWh compared with 740 kWh
for Brazil in 1975 and 1,140 kWh for Venezuela in 1974. The Greater Buenos
Aires region is 90% electrified with a per capita consumption of 1,170 kWh
(1975). The main consumer categories are industrial and residential, account-
ing for 43% and 32% respectively of total consumption. In 1975, public
service generation was 24,554 GWh compared with 16,800 GWh in 1970. Captive
generation was 4,900 GWh, practically unchanged since 1970. Total installed
capacity in Argentina in 1975 was 9,280 MW of which about 2,000 MW correspond
to captive plants.
23.       The projection adopted by the previous authorities of an annual
growth of 11.5% for the period 1976-86 proved to be unrealistic. The maximum
growth rate now suggested by the Government are 0% growth in 1976, 5% in 1977,
8% in 1978 and 10% annually thereafter.
Sector Organization
24.       The power sector is, in theory, regulated by the Secretaria de
Energia, which is responsible for planning, granting concessions to public
utilities and self-suppliers and approving tariffs. However, many agencies
participate in major investment decisions in the sector. The Comision Nacional
de la Cuenca del Plata, CONCAP, a body which coordinates Argentina's participa-
tion in international projects with Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay,
plays a major role in the construction of the Salto Grande hydroelectric
project with Uruguay and the preparation of the Yacyreta-Apipe hydroelectric
project on the Parana river with Paraguay. The national nuclear energy
commission (CNEA) is in charge of building and operating nuclear power plants



- 9 -
and reports directly to the President of Argentina. The two major provincial
electric companies controlled by the provincial Governments of Buenos Aires
and Cordoba, DEBA and EPEC, as well as other smaller provincial utilities,
also make investment decisions and set tariffs independently of the Secretaria
de Energia.
Future Sector Investments
25.       In the absence of a proper long term sales forecast, the major power
generation projects already under construction are likely to provide, well
into the 1980's, the central interconnected system with substantial surplus
capacity at considerable cost to the economy. In view of this, the Government
has reviewed all outstanding commitments for major generation and transmission
projects to determine the possibility of delaying or cancelling them, and
decided to defer for the present the Alicura hydroelectric project recently
initiated by HIDRONOR.
26.       The Government is aware of the need for improvement in the sector's
structure and, under the project, will carry out a national power sector
organization study and also prepare a national power expansion plan based on
the least-cost program for expanding generation and transmission. During
negotiations, agreement was reached on the draft terms of reference for the
plan and the study. The Government will retain individual international
experts (to be financed under the proposed loan) to assist in certain specific
aspects where national expertise is lacking (Section 2.03 (c) of the draft
Guarantee Agreement) and will discuss the results of the study and the plan
with the Bank (Section 2.04 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). Furthermore,
the Government has agreed not to approve any major new investment in genera-
tion and transmission until the national power expansion plan is prepared
(Section 3.07 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Tariffs and Asset Revaluation
27.       In order to reduce operational deficits of public service enter-
prises, the new Government took action shortly after coming to power in March
1976, to raise their tariffs. SEGBA was authorized to raise its tariffs 10%
monthly from April 1976 (a 20% additional increase was authorized in July) and
the Government intends to continue this policy through 1976. SEGBA and the
Government have agreed to maintain tariffs at the level necessary to obtain
beginning in 1977 an 8% rate of return on its net fixed assets in operation,
valued at acquisition cost in US dollars, as provided by its Concession
Agreement (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 3.03 of the
draft Guarantee Agreement). The Government has assured the Bank that it
intends to raise the tariffs for bulk supply by HIDRONOR and CNEA's Atucha
nuclear power plant to provide an 8% rate of return on investment by end-1977.
In addition, the Government plans to gradually increase prices for fuel used
in electricity generation (at present only 25% of international levels) to
reach 75-80% of international prices by end-1978. These goals are reasonable
and would lead to a substantial improvement in energy sector finances.



- 10 -
28.       There is no consistent approach to revaluation of power sector
assets. As stated above, SEGBA's concession stipulates the use of historic
US dollar values and other entities use other methods. As part of the sector
organization study, the government intends to carry out a study to develop
proposals for a uniform methodology to enable all the power utilities to
revalue their assets uniformly and realistically.
Greater Buenos Aires Subregion
29.       Argentina's principal power market is located in a region covering
the city of Buenos Aires and parts of the provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre
Rios and Santa Fe. This area, referred to as the Buenos Aires-Litoral
region, includes 57% of the country's population and accounts for 70% of total
electric power consumption. Within the Buenos Aires-Litoral Region, the city
of Buenos Aires and 31 surrounding municipalities of the province of Buenos
Aires contain 70% of the population and account for 71% of the consumption of
electric power. This power is distributed by SEGBA and Compania Italo Argentina
de Electricidad S.A. (CIAE), which in 1976 had a combined installed generating
capacity of 2,971 MW, all thermal. SEGBA is the principal supplier and its
concession covers the whole subregion while CIAE's concession area (which
overlaps with that of SEGBA) includes one third of the city of Buenos Aires
and four of the remaining municipalities. The Government agreed to ensure
that the two utilities will continue to coordinate their investment programs
to avoid duplication of facilities which might otherwise result from their
overlapping concession areas (Section 3.05 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
30.       SEGBA and CIAE served 3.1 million consumers in 1975 (of which
2.7 million were served by SEGBA) and sold 10,300 GWh, of which 8,800 GWh
were sold by SEGBA. Captive plants in the subregion generated 1,400 GWh in
1975. These plants were installed by many industrial and commercial consumers
as a result of the power shortages of the 1950s and early 1960s, but as a
result of SEGBA's ability to provide more reliable and economic service, their
output has stagnated since 1970.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Argentina
in June/ July 1976. A report, entitled "Appraisal of the Fourth Buenos Aires
Power Project Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA)," No. 675b-AR
dated September 7, 1976 is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. A loan and project summary is presented in Annex III. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington from August 16 to 20. The Government delegation
was headed by Mr. Bernardo Bronstein, Subsecretary of Electrical Energy,
Ministry of Economy, and the SEGBA delegation was headed by Mr. Oscar Briozzo,
Executive Vice President.



The Borrower
32.       SEGBA, the proposed borrower, is a corporation formed in 1958 to
take over most of the assets and responsibilities of the Compania Argentina de
Eletricidad (CADE). Its shares are wholly owned by the Argentine Government
through the Corporacion de Empresas Nacionales (CEN), a holding company for
most government-owned enterprises. Although CEN has legal powers governing
the general policies of its subsidiaries, the latter have retained their
autonomy in carrying out their day-to-day business. SEGBA's Bylaws, as
approved in 1961 in connection with Loan 308-AR, were intended to ensure
that the company become an independent, well managed and financially viable
utility. However, the Bylaws were amended in 1972 to reflect the Government's
intention to exert a greater degree of control over the company. This action
was reversed with the approval of the new Bylaws in July 1976, which are
basically the same as those of 1961 and are satisfactory.
33.       SEGBA has a Board of Directors of eight members, appointed by the
Government through CEN. The Board chooses two of its members to serve as
President (Chairman of the Board) and Executive Vice President (General
Manager). The Executive Vice President is responsible for day-to-day manage-
ment. He is assisted by a committee of six department heads (Administration
and Finance, Planning, Personnel, Procurement, Commercial and Technical). In
July 1976 a new Board of Directors took charge of SEGBA's management. The new
Executive Vice President is a capable engineer with more than 30 years' ser-
vice with SEGBA and its predecessor utility. Before resigning in 1972, he
held the post of technical manager. The newly appointed managers and assist-
ant managers are experienced SEGBA staff members and constitute a competent
team.
34.       SEGBA's accounting, internal audit and 'data processing are satis-
factory. Nearly all commercial and accounting processes as well as.personnel
records, stores, inventories and procurement are computerized. The monthly
financial statements and the budgetary report have been delayed in recent
months. The necessary steps are being taken to speed up their preparation and
ensure their timely availability.
35.       The deterioration of SEGBA's efficiency and the effects of low
tariffs were such that since 1970, SEGBA has been earning less than the 8%
rate of return on its rate base guaranteed by its Concession Agreement and
reflected in its agreements with the Bank; and in 1974 and 1975, its earnings
became negative. This performance was particularly poor since SEGBA paid very
low prices for its purchases of fuel and bulk electricity from other public
enterprises. Although SEGBA's financial situation has improved considerably
in 1976 owing to recent tariff increases, earnings and 'the contribution of
internal cash generation to the expansion program this year are still expected
to be very low. By December 31, 1976, SEGBA's total accumulated shortfall
in earnings in comparison to its authorized 8% rate of return is expected
to reach US$123.4 million.   To offset this shortfall, the Government agreed
to make available US$86.8 million through budgetary funds by June'30, 1977
(Section 2.02 (c) of the draft Guarantee Agreement) and intends to allow



- 12 -
SEGBA to charge tariffs sufficient to enable it to recover the remaining
US$36.6 million in the years 1977-79. After 1979, SEGBA would maintain a
rate of return of 8%, while paying substantially higher prices for fuel and
purchased power. The projected earnings would enable SEGBA to finance a
significant portion (51%) of its 1977-80 expansion program from internal cash
generation.
36.       SEGBA's debt/equity ratio was 34/66 in 1975 and is expected to
become 31/69 by 1981. SEGBA would not contract any long-term loans without
the Bank's concurrence if its internal cash generation were less than 1.5
times debt-service obligations (Section 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The Government and SEGBA are fully aware of the problem of SEGBA
maintaining employment levels far in excess of those usual for the sector.
They intend to reduce substantially the number of employees from the present
figure of 26,300 to 22,800 in 1978, and thus increase the number of customers
per employee from 102 in 1975 to 126 in 1978.
38.       SEGBA has a comprehensive training program and maintains two
centers to fulfill the majority of its training needs. Other specialized
training is carried out at other local institutions (technical universities,
etc.) and for very specialized subjects (for graduate engineers) use is made
of the training facilities of Electricite de France and of suppliers of
sophisticated equipment. SEGBA intends to train 2,000 persons during the
years 1977-78 in subjects varying from low-tension networks maintenance to
load dispatching.
Project Description
39.       The project proposed for Bank financing consists of the main ele-
ments of SEGBA's transmission and distribution expansion requirements for
1977-81. These include the addition of about 374 circuit km of transmission
lines, 7,100 MVA of transformer capacity and associated switchgear, 8,240 km
of distribution lines and 884 MVA of transformer capacity in 4,600 low-tension
substations, meters and equipment for 180,000 service connections, and studies
to be carried out by the Government with the assistance of consultants.
Service to Low-Income Groups
40.       The low-income population of the Greater Buenos Aires area has grown
very rapidly due to immigration from rural areas and neighboring countries
and large shanty towns have developed. Many of these dwellings in these
shanty towns are connected to the nearest power line through illegal hook-
ups which present serious problems of safety, in addition to financial losses
to SEGBA. SEGBA has estimated that about 250,000 persons live in 70,000
dwellings in 110 different shanty towns. SEGBA intends to reach agreement
with the municipalities, where these shanty towns are located, on a plan
to sell energy to the municipality in bulk for distribution within each shanty
town.



- 13 -
41.       There are also about 25,000 dwellings in new low-cost housing
developments without electric service. SEGBA intends to connect these during
the next three years with an investment of about US$6 million as part of the
project.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
42.       The estimated cost of the project is US$495.3 million equivalent,
including a foreign currency component of US$152.6 million. These cost esti-
mates were prepared by SEGBA and are based on mid-1976 prices as quoted by
different manufacturers. Physical contingencies were estimated at 2% for all
project components except for the 500 kV installations for which a 10% physical
contingency allocation has been provided. Price contingencies for both local
and foreign costs were based on the following percentages: 4.5% in 1976
(half-year), 8% per annum in 1977 through 1979, and 7% per annum thereafter.
The estimated cost for engineering, supervision and administration was based
on SEGBA's experience with ongoing works. Consultant services have been
estimated on the basis of an average cost of US$4,870 per man-month (excluding
travel and subsistence).
43.       The proposed US$115 million Bank loan to SEGBA would cover 75% of
the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The Bank loan would have an
interest rate of 8.9% and a term of 15 years including three years of grace.
The proposed loan includes US$500,000 for 60 man-months of consultant services
to assist the Government to carry out the organization study and the expansion
plan (para 26). The Government would assume the responsibility for the repay-
ment of these funds to SEGBA (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). The
balance of SEGBA's financial requirements for the period 1977-80 is expected
to be met by the Government's 1977 contribution of US$36.5 million, loans
from foreign and local banks of US$206.0 million, and the drawdown of US$39.8
million of existing loans. The Government agreed that it will provide funds
sufficient to protect SEGBA against any failure to secure financing from
foreign and local banks during 1977-80 on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank (Section 2.02 (c) of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
44.       SEGBA's capital investment and financing plan during the period of
loan disbursement can be summarized as follows:

/1   An additional US$69.8 million (after the proposed loan is fully dis-
bursed) would be expended in 1981 to complete the project.
45.       While in Washington for negotiations, the representatives of
Government and SEGBA held discussions with a US investment bank of inter-
national standing, regarding the possibility of a loan of about US$50 mil-
lion at medium term to supplement the proposed Bank loan. Such financing
would be in addition to the Bank loan and in substitution for some of the
borrowings which SEGBA would otherwise undertake within Argentina. We have
informed the prospective lender, as well as SEGBA, that we would be prepared
to recommend to the Executive Directors our association with them or other
co-lenders, if this were to result in better terms for the Borrower than it
could otherwise obtain in international markets. It seems likely that the
arrangements for the private co-financing would be concluded within six



- 15 -
months after the approval of the Bank's loan. The form that this associa-
tion might take is described in my memorandum to the Executive Directors of
May 29, 1975 relating to a loan in Brazil to CSN (R75-103/1). If and when
such a co-financing operation materializes we would return to the Executive
Directors with full details regarding the proposed private loan and appro-
priate recommendations for amendments to the Bank Loan Agreement.
Tariff Structure
46.       SEGBA's tariff schedule for residential consumers is based on a
low "social" rate for small consumers (up to 60 kWh/month), with progressively
higher charges to larger residential users. Tariffs for large industrial
consumers incorporate a peak and off-peak variation in charges. SEGBA should
consider a more elaborate tariff structure for medium-sized commercial and
industrial consumers with a maximum demand of less than 50 kWh. Such consumers
are presently included in a "general service" category which does not provide
any incentive for high voltage supply or off-peak consumption. The Government.
and SEGBA have agreed to carry out a study of SEGBA's tariff structure with a
view to identifying areas for improvement and to discuss its conclusions with
the Bank (Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 3.06 of the
draft Guarantee Agreement).
Engineering and Construction
47.       The basic design of the distribution expansion program as well as
the studies for the high tension transmission system were developed by SEGBA
with the assistance of consultants. SEGBA employs contractors for the con-
struction of high and mid-tension overhead and underground transmission lines,
for a part of the low-tension distribution lines and substations and for the
new high-tension substations. Expansions of existing substations, part of the
low-tension distribution lines and substations and service connections will be
undertaken by SEGBA's own forces. With the exception of the lines and sub-
stations involved in the completion of the 500/220 kV ring, the above described
works are part of a continuous expansion of the subtransmission and distribu-
tion system. The project corresponds to works to be initiated in mid-1977 and
to be completed by mid-1981.
Procurement and Disbursement
48.       Procurement procedures substantially the same as those agreed for
the previous loan to SEGBA (Loan 644-AR) will be used for the proposed loan
(Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement). They provide that bids for two
thirds of the equipment and materials of each lot to be procured would be
invited on an international basis, with Argentine bidders receiving a 15%
margin of preference of the cif price of the lowest qualified foreign bidder
or the applicable custom duties, whichever is lower. If an Argentine bidder
were successful for this two thirds, he will be invited to supply the other
one third at the same price. If a foreign bidder were awarded the contract
for the two thirds, separate bids from Argentine suppliers would be opened
and a contract would be awarded to the lowest bidder if his price were below



- 16 -
138% of the cif price of the successful foreign bidder for the two thirds.
However, any domestic procurement undertaken on this basis would not be
eligible for financing out of the loan. If all Argentine suppliers' prices
were above 138% and they were not willing to reduce their prices to that
level, the successful foreign bidder for the two thirds would be invited also
to supply the one third at the same unit price. This rather complex procure-
ment procedure was adopted to give Argentine industry an expanded opportunity
to supply some equipment under the project, without excessively increasing
total project cost. Were foreign suppliers to be awarded two thirds of the
contract under international competitive bidding and Argentine suppliers to
win the remaining one third of the contracts at the 38% differential, the
combined cost of the foreign and local supplier contracts would be less than
15% above the international competitive bid price.
49.       Disbursement from the Bank loan would be made against appropriate
documentation for 100% of foreign expenditures on imported goods and 60%
(estimated foreign exchange component) of equipment procured in Argentina for
contracts awarded through international competitive bidding and 100% of the
cost of consultant services. Based on the experience of the previous SEGBA
loans, it is estimated that about US$40 million of the Bank loan will be
disbursed against imported equipment and US$75 million against domestic
equipment.
Project Benefits and Risks
50.       The proposed loan would make a significant contribution both to the
Argentine power sector and to SEGBA. In terms of the sector we would assist
the Government (a) to streamline sector organization, regulation, planning,
financing and operation; and (b) to formulate a national power expansion plan
based on the least cost program for expanding generation and transmission
facilities which would incorporate reasonable criteria for establishing system
reserves and the most rational use of indigenous energy resources, including
coal, uranium, and hydroelectricity.
51.       With regard to SEGBA, the project would provide the transmission
facilities necessary to permit utilization of the energy produced at the hydro-
power plants of El Chocon, Planicie Banderita and Salto Grande and at the
nuclear power plant at Atucha. The availability of this energy will allow
SEGBA to meet the increasing demand for power due to the expected revitaliza-
tion of industrial activities in Argentina as a result of the economic policy
applied by the present Government. The growth in the industrial sector has
been the main factor in the increase of electricity consumption (56% of the
total over the last five years) and the project would provide the facilities
required to support a continuation of this growth. The project would also
provide the distribution facilities necessary to bring this energy to the
final consumers (65,000 new consumers are expected to be connected annually),
reduce losses and improve the efficiency of SEGBA's operation and the reliab-
ility of service due to the incorporation of urgently needed communications,
telecontrol, telemetering and load dispatching equipment. The project is
not expected to have any adverse impact on the environment.



- 17 -
52.       SEGBA is well qualified to implement the project and the risks of
the project from the technical point of view are no greater than those normal
for projects of this type. It is recognized, however, that in the past,
Government intervention and an adverse general economic environment resulted
in a deterioration of SEGBA's efficiency and a severe reduction in its earn-
ings. The policies of the present Government and the measures agreed in con-
junction with the proposed loan are designed to enable SEGBA to improve its
efficiency and financial position in the future.
53.       The benefits of the project, as a proxy, are assumed to be the price
of electricity paid by the ultimate consumer. The project costs consist of
investment and operating costs and the costs of bulk power and fuel (realistic-
ally priced as noted in paragraph 27) purchased by SEGBA. Based on these
assumptions, the economic rate of return on the project investment is estimated
to be about 21%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return would
exceed 18% even if costs are assumed to rise by 10%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Servicios Electricos
del Gran Buenos Aires S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between The
Argentine Republic and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee
Agreements of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 26, 27, 29, 35,
36, 43, 46 and 48.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of July 31, 1976)
Loan No. 505 - Balcarce Livestock Project, US$15.3 million loan of July 31,
1967; Effective Date: August 31, 1967; Closing Date: July 31,
1977.
Lending to ranchers and contractors progressed very slowly
from loan effectiveness until 1970, then accelerated as cattle
prices Lncreased and technical services improved. From 1970
to 1973, project performance was satisfactory and a substan-
tial amount of the loan was disbursed. However, the closing
of the European Economic Community (EEC) to Argentine beef
imports in 1974 limited external demand for beef and slowed
down ranchers' demand for investment credits. Aware that a
renewed interest by ranchers in investment credits is closely
linked to the opening of European markets, the Argentine Gov-
ernment has recently held discussions with EEC authorities
with a view to regaining a strong market in Europe. At present,
about 25% of the Bank loan still remains to be disbursed.
Loan No. 619 - Second Highway Project, US$25 million loan of June 24, 1969;
Effective Date: October 1, 1969; Closing Date: December 31,
1976.
All components of the project as originally defined have been
completed at a cost substantially below the appraisal estimate.
The overall quality of construction and supervision is satis-
factory. The undisbursed loan amount of US$5.9 million has
been reallocated to the construction of the Rio Colorado-
Cotita and Pradere-Rufino roads, after being appraised by the
Bank. The works in these two raods have been delayed mainly
because of problems in the supply of materials such as steel,
cement and asphalt. The National Highways Department has taken
measilres to improve this situation.
Loan No. 733 - RaiLWy Project, US$84 million loan of April 28, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date: December 31,
1976.
Due to the socio-economic situation, it became clear in 1973-
1974 that the original Project could not be implemented. On
July 2, 1974, US$27.5 million (or about one-third of the
US$84.0 million loan) was cancelled. The remaining US$56.5
million were to finance procurement committed by the original
Closing Date, April 30, 1974, which was then postponed to
December 31, 1976. After having come almost to a standstill



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 4
in 1975, procurement has regained momentum.    The
last of 59 contracts for Bank-financed goods was finally
signed in May 1976. Goods have been delivered for 40
contracts, and the revised loan is now 83% disbursed.
Loan No. 734 - Third Highway Project, US$67.5 million loan of May 5, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The overall quality of construction and supervision for the
28 road sections included in the project is satisfactory.
Fourteen of the road sections have been now completed, and
seven will be finalized during the second half of 1976.
However, the remaining are experiencing difficulties because
of delays in execution and substantial cost overruns. Delays
were due to unfavorable climatic conditions, unforeseen prob-
lems in the preparation of design plans arising from difficult
soil conditions, and rampant inflation together with low con-
tract prices which did not permit most contractors to operate
profitably. The National Highways Department has taken
measures to improve this situation.

ence to local suppliers of 15% or the
applicable import duties, whichever is lower.
The remaining one-third would be awarded to
an Argentine bidder, provided that this bid
is not more than 38% above the successful
foreign bidder or he is willing to reduce
his bid to such level. If the remaining
third goes to an Argentine supplier under
this arrangement, the contract with that
supplier would not be financed by the Bank.
The Bank would finance 100% of the cif cost
of imported equipment; 60% of the cost of
equipment procured in Argentina (the esti-
mated foreign exchange component) under inter-
national competitive bidding, and 100% of
the cost of consultant services.
Rate of Return:                  21% for the Project.
Appraisal Report:                Report No. 675b-AR, dated September 7, 1976.
