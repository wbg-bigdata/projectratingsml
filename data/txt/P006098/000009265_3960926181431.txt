MDORANDUM AND LECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BELIZE
FOR THE SECOND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomendation  on a proposed loan to
Belize for USS5.6 million equivalent ii submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard IBiD termn with 17 years, mturity,
including five years' grace, and would help finance a road maintenance and
rehabilitation project.
2.       Backaround.  Belize has one  of the lowest population densities in
the world.   This  situation,  further  complicated by scattered production
areas and low production volumes, makes unit transport user costs (per ton
and passenger) and road maintenance costs very high. The high incidence of
transport costs in the price of goods and services makes providing
efficient transport and preserving the capital infrastructure stock high
priority  development  objectives  for   Belize  in  support  of  increased
agricultural diversification and exports, and tourism development.
3.       For the transport sector  in  general, and highways in particular,
to contribute to the strategies and objectives of the Government, issues
related to maintenance management and funding, institutional transport
coordination and  tra,ning  need  to  be  addressed.    Data collection and
procedures for managing highway maintenance programming and implementation
were started under the already completed first Bank project, but the system
does not yet integrate, nor permit evaluation of maintenance planning,
budgeting and execution, nor has it been fully adapted to local conditions.
Maintenance funding  remains  insufficient  and  MOW's  limited capacity is
strained by force-account efforts placed on feeder road rehabilitation.
The Government is also aware of potential inefficiencies arising from the
present dispersion of responsibility of several ministries over fragments
of the transport system, and from the lack of sufficient qualified staff,
particularly in transport planning and highway maintenance.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In line with Belize's development
objectives, the Bank supports strategies to improve public sector manage-
ment, encourage private sector investment and strengthen public finances.
The first Bank-financed highway project as well as the proposed new opera-
tion reinforce such strategies.    The  previous  project focused mainly on
rehabilitation  civil  works,   production   of  concrete  drainage  pipes,
acquisition of maintenance equipment and spare parts, improvement of
workshops and training of field maintenance and workshop personnel.
*           Improvements in highway  maintenance  management  initiated under the first
project would be further advanced and consolidated under the proposed
operation. Developing and strengthening highway maintenance capacity needs
a sustained, systematic approach and justifies the Bank's continued
involvement. Moreover, the Bank's assistance would be timely, given that
the current conditions of highways allow for maintenance to be still
effective, and would reinforce MOW's direct efforts by initiating contract
maintenance.



5.       ProJect Objectives.  The  primary  objective  of the project is to
improve further MOW's management and technical procedures to provide
efficient and safe levels of service to highway "sers. In particular the
project would assist in:   (a)  developing capacity for highway mnagement,
especially maintenance; (b) carrying out a pilot program of maintenance by
private contractors; (c) training staff and i.'mplementing revised procedures
for   integrating   maintenance   planning,   programuing,   budgeting  and
performance evaluation; (d) reviewing the need for improved definition ard
coordination of functions and responsibilities of different transport
agencies; and (e) upgrading, rehabilitating, seal-coating, and completing
drainage structures on key sections of the highway system.
6.       Proiect Description.  The project  would include the following, to
be  carried  out  by  contract   except  where  indicated:         (a)  periodic
maintenance (seal-coating) of three highway sections (53.5 km), two on the
Northern Highway and one on the Western Highway %4.8S of total cost); (b)
completion of drainage structures and two years of routine/periodic main-
tenance on 104 km of the unpaved Southern Highway (4.92): (c) three years
of routine maintenance on the paved Northern Highway (152 km) (4.82); (d)
rehabilitation of one paved section of the Northern Highway (2.6 km), close
to Belize City (4.62); (e) rehabilitation, including paving of the 1.8 km
access road (Central American Boulevard and Caesar's Ridge road) to the
Belize City Port and the 12.5 km San Ignacio-Benque Viejo section of the
Western Highway (22.22); (f) contrcl.led routine maintenance of the San
Ignacio-Belmopan paved section (36.8 km), under force account and for
training of MOW personnel, over  a two-year period (0.42); (g) scholarships
for training abroad in  transport  planning and highway maintenance (0.62);
(h) professional services for engineering designs, supervision of civil
works,  training   of   contractors   and   MOW   personnel,  institutional
coordination and accounting studies (6.32); and (i) a program for routine
maintenance, under monitored force account  and over a three-year period on
the remainder of the network (51.4Z).   The project, to be carried out over
four years, provides funds for civil works and related supervision;
engineering designs; training; and technical assistance. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$15.6 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$8.1 million (52Z).    A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Belize are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.7089-BEL dated May 11,
1988, is also attached.
7.       Actions Agreed.  Agreement  was  reached on the following actions:
(a) as a condition of effectiveness, assigning MOW's Chief Engineer as
project coordinator and hiring consultants for supervision of works and
training; (b) monitoring, reviewing and adjusting by MOW, with assistance
from works supervision consultants, of the existing maintenance management
system;  preparing  and   updating   the  three-year  maintenance  program;
instructing its maintenance personnel, revising technical specifications,
advising contractors of changes, and carrying out the program; system to be
fully validated by not later than December 31, 1990; (c) MOW and the Bank
jointly reviewing progress in project implementation and drawing up,
discussing and implementing action programs acceptable to the Bank; such



-3-
reviews to take place by June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning in
1989; (d) no disbursing of loan funds for resealing and rehabilitation
works scheduled to begin implementation in 1991 unless tlhe Bank would have
received  and  found  a*  eptable  the  1991-1993  Maintenance  Program; (e)
including in the Government's annual budget specific amounts of counterpart
funds to ensure full financing consistent with the agreed implementation
program; and (f) assigning, not later than December 31, 1988, a road
maintenance officer and a training  officer as suitable counterparts to the
supervision-cum-training consultants.
8.       Benefits.  The project is  designed  to reduce highway costs, par-
ticularly user costs, and to defer large capital outlays through adequate
maintenance. The economic rate of return for loan-financed components is
342. The pilot program for contract maintenance is particularly important
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maintenance procedures, develop smail
local contractors, and ensure effective maintenance of the roads. The
institutional development elements of the project would increase the
Goverrnent's capacity for highway management, improve maintenance planning,
programming, budgeting and performance evaluation and Legin to address the
issue of transport coordination.
9.       Risks.  Two  are  she  main  risks:    availability of counterpart
funding and the relative weakness of the local construction industry. In
the recent past, the Government was able to rely on doror agencies when
additional project counterpart funding was required. This assistance is no
longer available.   To  mitigate  the  risks  of  a shortage of counterpart
funds, a deliberately moderate implementation program was developed and
adopted. The second risk would be minimized by the programmed consultants'
supervision of works and training of contractors' personnei, and by the ICB
procedures to be followed for rehabilitation and resealing works, which are
expected to attract foreign contractors.
10.      Reconnendation.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  pr posed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
