                          The majority of the consultancies underlying the eGovernment applications are complete (93% of funds committed for 2012), and the project is gearing up for the procurement of
                         major e-Government applications, information systems and goods that account for the majority of project funding;
                          There are 12 procurement processes currently underway that account for an estimated cost of US$ 3.8 million. The bids for the large eGovernment systems, including the Multi-
                         Purpose ID System (MPID), Public Financial Management (PFM: National Budget Preparation and Reporting), eTax Filing system, eTendering System for OECS Pharmaceuticals,
                         and the Regional Health Information System, have been received by the REGU. The proposed costs from vendors are now known and several offers are currently under negotiation;
                                 The extension of St. Vincent backbone is completed. The national sub-projects for Dominica, Grenada and St. Vincent are also completed, and St. Lucia's Government Web
                         Portal consultancy will be completed by September;
                                 The EGRIP-funded OECS Harmonized E-government Legislation was ratified at the OECS Authority Meeting of 24 January 2012.
