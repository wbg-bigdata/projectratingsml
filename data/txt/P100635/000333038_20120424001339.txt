                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
1. This restructuring paper proposes (i) an extension of the closing date of three country
projects under the first OECS E-Government and Regional Integration Project (EGRIP)
APL (P100635), comprising Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia. The closing date will be
extended from June 30, 2012 to August 31, 2013, to align the date to the closing date of
the St Vincent and the Grenadines Project (P117087), which constitutes a second phase
of the APL; and (ii) the modification of indicators from the Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) framework for all the four country projects under the EGRIP program, as some
indicators do not longer reflect the outcomes of the project. The Project Development
Objective remains unchanged.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. EGRIP is financed as a horizontal APL with two phases. The respective countries for
the three country projects under the first phase of the APL were approved by the Board in
May 2008, in an aggregate amount of SDR 4.5 million as follows: the Commonwealth of
Dominica, SDR 1.5 million, Grenada SDR 1.5 million, and Saint Lucia, SDR 1.5 million
equivalent. The respective Financing Agreements became effective on June 18, 2009.
The Closing Date for all the three credits is June 30, 2012. The Board approved the Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines Project under the second phase of the APL for SDR 1.5
million equivalent in December 2009, with a closing date of August 31, 2013.

3. EGRIP’s Program Development Objective (PDO), which also forms the objective of
the respective projects, is to promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency of public
services through the delivery of regionally integrated e-government applications that
apply economies of scale. The progress towards the achievement of PDO and the overall
Implementation Progress (IP) are rated moderately satisfactory mainly due to the
disbursement ratio still being low at 26%, resulting from an initial one year effectiveness
delay. However, the client has made substantial efforts to accelerate disbursements over
the past year and significant progress has been made. It is expected that after a significant
increase in disbursements occurs a possible upgrade of the IP and DO ratings may be
considered.

4. Each of the country projects under the EGRIP Program is being implemented by the
OECS Secretariat, Regional E-Government Unit (REGU). The organizational structure is
defined at two levels: (i) at the regional level, two new structures were created, the
Regional Technical Committee (RTC) for the project and the REGU; (ii) at the national
level, the project is coordinated by the respective ICT or e-Government units, which are
the national focal points for the project and provide assistance to the REGU at the
national level. The national focal points are in charge of the day-to-day management of
the technical and logistical aspects of the project. The RTC is responsible for providing
overall policy guidance to the REGU including monitoring and evaluation of

                                             4
implementation progress and addressing implementation bottlenecks. The REGU reports
directly to the OECS Secretariat, seeks guidance from the RTC, and is responsible for
providing timely reports to the governments, the Bank and other donors.

5. The projects under the EGRIP Program are structured along three components with the
first two as the main substantive components:

6. Component 1. Horizontal (Cross-Sector). E-Government interventions addressed to
strengthen and harmonize national and regional e-government processes, operational ICT
development and promote capacity building; Consultancies are under implementation
within the framework of this component: monitoring and evaluation, legal and regulatory
framework, standards and architecture assessment, framework for total cost of ownership
optimization, design of regional institutional framework, and needs assessment for
national ID system. In addition, “quick win? sub-projects in support of the focal points
for each of the four participating countries have been procured: video-conferencing
equipment for Dominica and St. Vincent, a local network for the Prime Minister’s Office
in Grenada, and a Web portal for St. Lucia.

7. Component 2 Vertical (Sector). Interventions aimed at improving key e-government
systems by focusing in core areas of public finance; Consultancies are under
implementation within the framework of this component: PFM and customs systems
support, Tax information systems support, e-procurement system design, and e-health
system design. In addition, a number of goods procurement processes have been launched
for the implementation of information systems and procurement of equipment including:
i) upgrade of modules and interfaces for PFM system; ii) development of tax e-filing
system; iii) development of the Regional Customs Information System; and iv) St.
Vincent-specific activities, such as the government’s web portal and expansion of the
Intranet backbone.

8. Component 3 Project Management, aimed at supporting the establishment of the
Regional E-Government Unit (REGU). This component is completed as a Project
Manager was hired; the REGU team was established and is fully functional and
operational.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

9. The Project Development Objective remains unchanged and this is a Level 2
restructuring. However, adjustments are required due to the requests of the Governments
to: i) adapt the indicators of the project with the actual conditions and; ii) accommodate
the closing date to the completion of the activities for the two projects. Project objectives
continue to be achievable as before.

      Results/indicators

   10. After the mid-term review in 2011, several indicators devised during project
   preparation in 2006 were identified as no longer reflective of the project outputs and
   outcomes. These include indicators that in the PAD were left intentionally to be
                                             5
defined during the first year of the project, but also others where the evolution of the
activity has adjusted to realities on the ground. For example, the conclusions from the
design consultancies of the e-Government applications funded under the project
reshaped, in some cases, the M&E indicators for those activities.

11. The project employed a capable M&E consultant, who found that it was too
difficult for implementing agencies to collect some outcome indicators. The team also
learned from the M&E Consultant that application-based surveys, which prompt users
to evaluate the system while using it, would be inadvisable in the cultural context of
the OECS.

12. The adjustments in PDO level indicators and in intermediate results indicators
(IRI) are described in detail in Annex 1.

   Closing date

13. It is proposed that the closing date of the first APL (P100635) be extended to
align it with that of the second APL (P117087), so that all projects close on August
31, 2013, as requested by Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia in their letters of August
2011. This recognizes the fact that the majority of project activities are implemented
as a single project, with pooled procurement for over 90 percent of financing and
contracts split among the four participating countries. The activities are being
implemented in line with the timetable negotiated with St. Vincent. Without an
extension, activities currently slated for pooled procurement by all four countries,
which brings financial savings, would not be feasible.

14. This would be the first extension of the first APL (P100635), and it is not
expected that Saint Vincent (P117087) project will require an extension.

15. The first APL (P100635) experienced a 14 month lag between Board approval
and effectiveness due to the time required to fully set up the REGU (hiring all staff),
as well as accommodating a fourth country joining the previous three in the
horizontal APL. In its second year, the project reached full implementation mode.
Disbursement rates appear low; however this is due to the project’s early activities
being consultancies to design the e-Government applications to be implemented
under the project. At mid-term review conducted during October 11-17, 2011, the
majority of these design consultancies were completed, and the project is gearing up
for the procurement of the e-Government applications, information systems and
goods that account for the majority of project funding. A significant increase in
disbursement levels is thus expected with this upcoming phase. An extension would
allow for the smooth conclusion of project activities on a realistic timeframe.

16. The change in the closing date would also enable the full utilization of a US$2.5
million Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) grant (of which US$1.7 million is
earmarked for EGRIP countries) that closes in September 2013, which complements
the EGRIP projects by co-financing selected components and expanding access to
some activities’ regionally pooled procurement to two non-EGRIP Caribbean


                                         6
   countries. Without the requested alignment of closing dates, these funds could not be
   fully and effectively employed.

   17. The project is compliant with the requirements of OP/BP 13. 30 for extensions:
    the project objectives remain achievable;
    the performance of the OECS Secretariat/REGU is satisfactory, even though the
       rating for the project as a whole is currently moderately satisfactory due to the one
       year delay of effectiveness. This rating is expected to be upgraded as
       disbursement rates increase with the procurement of e-Government systems.
    neither the credits, nor the relevant countries, are under suspension of
       disbursements; and
    there are no outstanding audit reports or audit reports not satisfactory to the Bank
       for the project.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

18. The proposed restructuring does not change substantially the scope of the Project nor
the amount of funding, and therefore it does not alter the Project’s economic and
financial viability. There are no new social or environmental issues. It does not trigger
new risks or exceptions to Bank policy.
