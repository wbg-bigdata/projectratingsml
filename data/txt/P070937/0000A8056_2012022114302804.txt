                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well towards achieving its Project Development Objectives. As of November 2011, 159 Full Time Schools (FTS) have been created through the Project.
                         Since the project started, a total of 42,519 student places have been added in FTS (90 percent of project target). The Project's Action Plan for 2012 includes 4853 additional student
                         places that will allow to have a total of 47,372 student places (100 percent of project target) at the project closing date, on December 31, 2012. The Project also continued the in-
                         service training for teachers in FTS and as of November 2011 it has trained 2,324 teachers (22.3 percent above the project target), and also supported in-service training activities for
                         teachers who work in regular schools in the country.
