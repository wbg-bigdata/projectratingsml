F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The Project’s PDO was to increase equity, quality, and efficiency in the provision of preschool and primary
education (p. 3, PAD). This objective was to be achieved by:
    i) expanding the full-time school model, which focused on students from socioeconomically
         disadvantaged backgrounds;
    ii) improving the quality of preschool and primary education by enhancing the teacher training system
         and introducing new teaching and learning instruments in the classroom; and
    iii) increasing the efficiency of education institutions.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDOs remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project. However, when the Project was
restructured in 2006, there was a significant change in the means through which the PDO would be met by
focusing not just on the “expansion of the full -time school model? but also on “school-level interventions?
serving socio-economically disadvantaged students in both full-time and non Full-Time Schools (FTSs).

Specifically, the Project’s PDO was still defined as to increase the equity, quality and efficiency in the
provision of preschool and primary education through: 1
    i) school-level interventions to raise education quality in schools servicing socio-economically
         disadvantaged students;

                                                        ii
    ii)    the enhancement of the teacher training system and the introduction in the classroom of new
           teaching and learning instruments; and
    iii)   an increase in the efficiency of primary education institutions.

This modification was reflected in the operational definition of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 2 and 3
that focused on quality and efficiency, respectively. While in the pre-restructuring period these two KPIs
were applied to students from disadvantaged and very disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds
attending FTSs, in the post-restructuring period, they were applied to students from disadvantaged and very
disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds attending both full-time and non-full time schools (See Project
Appraisal Document, page 3 and Annex 1; and Additional Financing Project Paper, Annex 1).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Since 1995, the Government of Uruguay (GoU) had been undertaking an education reform
that included as a priority the improvement of equity in education to ensure increased access to
education among the poor as well as increased quality in the education they received. The World
Bank had provided support to the GoU’s efforts to improve the equity, quality, and efficiency of
basic education (preschool and primary education) through two preceding operations: the
MECAEP I and II.3 The second project supported the expansion of the full-time school model
(Escuelas de Tiempo Completo - FTS), which was one of the central pillars of the GoU’s strategy
to achieve its objectives in basic education. The MECAEP III was designed to build on the
successes of these two projects to strengthen and expand on their achievements.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

2.     The PDO was to increase the equity, quality and efficiency in the provision of preschool
and primary education. The corresponding KPIs were:
KPI 1 - Expand the FTS model in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas;
KPI 2 - Improve the academic achievement results of students from more disadvantaged
        backgrounds in Language and Mathematics in 6th grade; and
KPI 3 - Reduce repetition rates for 1st and 2nd grade students from more disadvantaged
        backgrounds.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

3.      The PDO continued to be to increase the equity, quality and efficiency in the provision of
preschool and primary education throughout the life of the Project. However, in a Board level
restructuring on July 13, 2006 there was a significant change in the means through which the
PDO would be met. Specifically, some of the resources that were originally planned for
expanding the FTS model were redirected toward non FTSs serving disadvantaged students—the
so-called Priority Attention Schools (Escuelas de Atención Prioritaria - PASs) to support the
introduction of some of the elements of the FTS model associated with improved student learning,
such as an increase in school hours, teacher training, computer equipment, and school-community
linkages. In turn, this modification was reflected in the operational definition of KPIs 2 and 3 that
focused on quality and efficiency, respectively. While during the pre-restructuring period these
KPIs were applied to disadvantaged and very disadvantaged students attending FTSs only, in the
post-restructuring period they were applied to disadvantaged and very disadvantaged students
attending both FTSs and non FTSs (i.e., PASs).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

4.     The Project was intended to benefit the following target groups: i) students, particularly
those from disadvantaged and very disadvantaged socio-economic contexts through better

 Basic Education Quality Improvement Project (MECAEP I; P008171; Loan 3729-UY, approved May 3, 1994;
closed June 30, 2001) and the Second Basic Education Quality Improvement Project (MECAEP II; P041994 ; Loan
4831-UY, approved July 6, 1998, closed Feb. 29. 2004).


                                                     1
education made possible by the expansion of the FTS model and other quality enhancing tools
being introduced into the system; ii) parents who could potentially expand the number of hours
worked; and iii) school staff through greater teacher training opportunities as well as from the
teacher training reform.

1.5 Original Components

5.       Component 1 - Expansion of the FTS Model (US$44.52 million; 79.5 percent of total
Project cost): The main objective of this component was to expand the existing FTS pedagogical
model. It had four sub-components focusing on: i) construction, transformation, rehabilitation and
equipping of FTSs; ii) acquisition of school equipment, learning materials, and school libraries;
iii) teacher training on the FTS model, new education technologies, and bilingual education; and
iv) strengthening the partnership between schools and parents.

6.     Institutional Strengthening (US$11.06 million; 19.8 percent of total Project cost): The
main objective of this component was to strengthen individual schools and the education system
as a whole. It had four sub-components focusing on: i) reforming teacher training; ii)
development and implementation of Education Improvement Projects (PMEs); iii) monitoring of
the education program; and iv) project administration.

1.6 Revised Components

7.       The Project Description changed in the Board level restructuring of July 13, 2006. The
changes incorporated to the project, both through this restructuring and at the time of approval of
the Additional Financing in 2010 were the following: i) the expansion of the FTS model in urban
and rural areas was scaled back in 2006; ii) the provision of technological equipment and learning
materials was expanded to include PASs (defined in the 2010 Loan Amendment as regular
schools that serve students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds) as well as FTS;
iii) the provision of textbooks was expanded to include all disadvantaged schools; iv) in-service
training was expanded to teachers and others in all disadvantaged schools, beyond
teacher/administrator training in the FTS model; v) bilingual teacher training was scaled up and
institutionalized under CEIP umbrella; vi) training of educational personnel in new technologies
was transferred to the Ceibal Program in 2006; vii) expansion of working hours would include
teachers at FTS and PASs4, beyond teachers at FTS; viii) the construction of a teacher training
institute was added; and ix) the number of education improvement subprojects was scaled up and
their emphasis on environment and health was eliminated. Table 2.1 in Annex 2 provides a detail
comparison of the changes introduced in 2006 and 2010 with respect to the time of project
approval.

1.7 Other significant changes

8.     Original Loan (P070937; Loan No. 7113-UR): The original Loan (US$42.00 million)
approved on April 25, 2002 became effective on September 13, 2002. There were two
amendments to the original Loan Agreement. On January 21, 2004, Schedule 1 was amended in
order to: i) increase the disbursement percentage for imported goods; and ii) reallocate the
amounts under existing categories of expenditures. In addition, the July 13, 2006 restructuring


4
    Expansion in PASs consisted in one monthly teachers’ meeting for curricular planning and other activities.


                                                            2
included a closing date extension of two years, from Dec. 31, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2009.

9.      Additional Financing (P070937; Loan No. 7789-UR): An Additional Financing (AF) in
an amount of US$29.9 million was approved on February 24, 2010 to address the financing gap
arising from the increase in Project costs associated with: i) a change in the GoU’s strategy on
civil works favoring new construction vis-à-vis renovation of existing classrooms; and ii) the
significant escalation of construction costs in the country. The AF’s closing date was December
31, 2012. There was one amendment to the AF on June 14, 2012, when Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement was amended in order to reallocate the amounts under existing categories of
expenditures.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

10.    QAE – Moderately Satisfactory. The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Assessment
conducted in June 2002 ranked the Project’s quality at entry as satisfactory, noting that it was a
solid intervention in line with the country’s strategic priorities and reflecting the Bank’s
comparative advantage. While the ICR recognizes the strength underscored by the QAG panel,
this ICR ranks QAE as Moderately Satisfactory in view of the design strengths and weaknesses
described below:

Strengths

11.     Long-term basic education strategy: The Project benefited from being inserted within a
long-term, multi-project strategy focusing on basic education supported by a series of four
projects that spanned over almost two decades. This, in turn, provided the learning opportunity
based on preceding operations. Based on the experience of the MECAEP I and II, several
modifications were incorporated: i) targeting FTSs not exclusively to disadvantaged student
populations to avoid creating a social stigma; ii) including pre-school education under the FTS
model as a way to enhance first-grade performance; iii) placing more emphasis on community
building and parent involvement; iv) broadening the social perspectives of textbooks; and v)
placing stronger emphasis on institutionalization. In addition, Project design benefited from a
series of stakeholder workshops, diagnostic studies and an impact evaluation (IE) of the FTS
model conducted by the Borrower in 2001-2002.

12.     High relevancy of PDO objectives: The Project was fully aligned with the GoU’s basic
education strategy and constituted an important element of the Bank’s support strategy for
Uruguay’s basic education. Specifically, the Project was fully aligned with the framework of the
Education Reform Program launched by the National Administration for Public Education
(Administración Nacional de la Educación Pública – ANEP) in 2000. 5 The Project was also
consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June 6,
2000, which focused on reinforcing Uruguay's economic and social development, giving
particular attention to activities that affected sustainability, addressed pockets of poverty, and
reduced economic vulnerability.

                                                        3
13.     Strong ownership for the FTS model: As noted in the QAG’s assessment, the Borrower’s
contribution to Project preparation was notably high, reflecting a high level of local ownership.
This is not surprising since the Project supported the implementation of the FTS model, a home-
grown initiative for which there was strong ownership among both teachers and administrators.
The FTS model has a strong historical significance in Uruguay, going back to the Open Air
schools (Escuelas al Aire Libre) that were established in the early 1900s to attend the educational
needs of students from TB-afflicted households.

Weaknesses

14.     Overly ambitious expectations: In retrospect, it is now clear that the expectations set at
appraisal were overly ambitious, both in terms of the pace at which new FTSs could be
established, as well as the impact that these newly established schools and teacher training
activities could have on education quality and efficiency during the operation’s lifetime. In
addition, more attention should have been given to the physical conditions of pre-existing FTS
buildings and the potential costs of rehabilitating them.

15.     Incomplete risk assessment: While the full impact of the 2001-2002 crisis in Argentina
and Brazil on Uruguay’s economy could not have been anticipated, it is notable that the issue was
ignored during appraisal. There is no mention of the macroeconomic risk under the Project’s risk
assessment, even though at appraisal (i.e., March 2002) and approval (i.e., September 2002) the
severity of the situation was already evident.

16.   Project preparation was unnecessarily accelerated. The MECAEP II was still under
implementation, with a significant portion of its funds still to be disbursed when this operation
was being appraised. In addition, substantial preparation work was still needed under various
components, including teacher’s training reform. These factors, together with the failure to assess
macroeconomic risk, translated into a very slow Project start-up.

2.2 Implementation

Factors outside the control of the Government and the implementing agency

17.     Sharp deterioration of socio-economic conditions: The Project’s implementation took
place under a difficult macroeconomic and socio-economic environment. The crises in
neighboring Argentina and Brazil in 2001-2002 severely affected Uruguay’s highly dependent
economy. The impact was severe, resulting in the sharp deterioration of socio-economic
conditions. As shown by the 2003 Ongoing Household Survey (2003), the number of people
living under the poverty line reached one-third of the population. This, in turn, resulted in an
increase in overall enrollment in public schools as a result of the migration from private schools
together with an increase in the number of students from disadvantaged contexts.

18.     Scarcity of counterpart funds: As a result of the tight fiscal situation resulting from the
crisis, public spending was tightly controlled, with across-the-board budget cuts and monthly
spending quotas established from 2002 through 2006, severely limiting the availability of
counterpart funds. This, in turn, slowed down Project disbursements and overall implementation.
The extension of the closing date of the preceding operation (MECAEP II) until February 2004
also contributed to slowing down Project implementation, as both operations were competing for
counterpart funds.


                                                4
19.     Change in the costs of physical works: Project costs associated with classroom
construction and rehabilitation changed significantly during implementation. As noted earlier,
physical targets were substantially reduced at restructuring, and the corresponding savings were
redirected at other school-level interventions in PASs. However, construction costs were
substantially higher than estimated at appraisal during the peak of Project implementation, which,
in turn, resulted in a cost overrun that was covered under the 2010 Additional Financing. In
addition, the AF also covered higher costs linked to a shift in Project focus from school
renovation of existing classrooms to construction of new schools.

Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

20.     Continuity of government policies: While Project implementation was carried out under
three different administrations, and despite the changes in the focus of the Project from only FTS
to all schools serving the most disadvantaged children, the Project’s Development Objective to
increase equity, quality and efficiency in the provision of preschool and primary education
remained unchanged.

21.      Weakened quality assurance mechanisms: The dismantling of the FTS Unit within the
Preschool and Primary Education Council (Consejo de Educación Inicial y Primaria - CEIP’s)
Technical Inspectorate in 2008 represented a significant loss in terms of quality assurance of the
FTS model. The FTS Unit, which had been established in 1999 within the CEIP’s permanent
institutional structure, had helped to protect the integrity of the FTS pedagogical model by
providing a cohesive management approach toward FTSs and ensuring that teachers and
administration assigned to FTSs were properly trained in the FTS curricula. The competitive
selection of FTS teachers, administrators and inspectors based on demonstrated proficiency and
merit was also eliminated at the time. This, together with high personnel rotation in newly
established FTSs, posed the danger that the FTS pedagogical model would lose its effectiveness,
offering “regular? teaching practices but over an extended school day.

22.    Changes in maximum classroom size: New regulations were issued in 2011 limiting
classroom size to 25 students. While this measure was aimed at enhancing the learning
environment, it negatively affected the achievement of one KPI target, which was based on FTS
enrollment given a predetermined number of additional FTS classrooms and a classroom size of
30 students.

23.     Changes in the original focus on rural schools: The Project originally envisioned the
expansion of the FTS model to rural schools with 30 students or more. While the expansion of
FTS model to rural schools was not formally eliminated under the 2006 restructuring, the target
regarding the number of rural schools to be built or rehabilitated as part of the FTS expansion was
reduced from 172 to 14 schools. These 14 rural schools had already been rehabilitated by 2006.
No additional activities focusing on rural schools were implemented during the remainder of the
Project, as the FTS model was deemed inefficient due to the small size of rural schools and not
relevant for rural settings.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control

24.     Institutional insertion. During the second half of Project implementation, the PCU
actively promoted the close participation of key institutional stakeholders, including not only the


                                                5
ANEP’s Central Steering Council (CODICEN) but also CEIP.6 Although at times this approach
proved challenging due to a need to reconcile different views, it was crucial to ensure the full
insertion of the FTS model and other Project activities within Uruguay’s education institutions. In
addition, the Project benefited from the close involvement of CIEP’s authorities and the technical
staff in charge of FTSs.

25.     Strong complementarity between school architecture and FTS pedagogical model.
School buildings were conceived as an intrinsic component of the FTS pedagogical model, in
which all architectural elements (e.g., architectural form, interior and common spaces, classrooms,
and landscaping) were seen as means for promoting learning and community building. Rather
than having one-size-fits-all solutions, each architectural design responded to the specific
characteristics of the population to be served and incorporated elements that had special meaning
for the school or the community.

26.     Participatory, collaborative approach. The Project benefited from meaningful
consultations with principals, teachers, students, parents of the schools that had been identified for
conversion to the FTS model as well as the surrounding communities. PCU architects actively
sought both input and feedback from the school and larger communities on the schools’
architectural design, resulting in highly personalized designs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

27.     Design, Implementation and Utilization. Output indicators defined at appraisal were
robust and clearly defined. However, while outcome indicators effectively captured the main
impacts expected from the operation in terms of equity, quality and efficiency, it was unclear to
which universe they were to be applied. On the one hand, the operational definition of KPI 2 and
3 in the Project Results Framework (PAD Annex 1, page 30) refers to students from
disadvantaged and very disadvantaged socio-economic contexts in general, which is consistent
with the baseline, particularly for KPI 2. On the other hand, FTS official assessments are
identified as the source of data to be utilized, thus implying that the FTSs were indeed the
universe to be measured. The latter definition—i.e., students from disadvantaged and very
disadvantaged socio-economic contexts enrolled in FTSs— is consistent with the operation’s
main focus on the expansion of the FTS model during the pre-restructuring period. During the
post-restructuring period, the universe is unambiguously defined as including students from
disadvantaged and very disadvantaged socio-economic contexts in both FTS and non FTSs.

28.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Implementation. The PCU closely monitored and
evaluated the progress of activities carried out under the Project. Substantial efforts were also
made to collect stakeholder feedback from the various activities and utilize it to improve them.
Output indicators provided a sound M&E tool to monitor the Project’s progress.

29.     Two significant methodological changes took place during the Project’s implementation:



6
  The ANEP is an autonomous institution mandated with carrying out policy. It is comprised of CODICEN, as well as
the Councils of Preschool and Primary Education (Consejo de Educación Inicial y Primaria, CEIP), Secondary
Education (Consejo de Educación Secundaria, CES), Technical Education (Consejo de Educación Tecnico
Profesional), and Educational Training (Consejo de Formación en Educación).


                                                       6
  i)     Learning outcomes: The National Evaluation of Learning Achievements (NELA) for the
         Sixth Grade of Primary School was carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2002, 2005 and 2009.
         However, while the 1996, 1999 and 2002 tests utilized the “classic test theory,? the 2005
         and 2009 tests were based on “item-response theory.? This change in methodology limited
         the comparability between the two periods and affected KPI 2, which was based on NELA
         results. For the purpose of this ICR, satisfactory level of achievement is defined as: i) 60
         percent of correct responses for the 1999-2002 tests, as indicated in the PAD; and ii)
         performing at a Level II (i.e., basic competency) or above for the 2005 and 2009 tests as
         suggested by ANEP’s Research, Evaluation and Statistics Division (División de
         Investigación, Evaluación, y Estadística – DIEE). To complement this indicator, this ICR
         also examines changes in the performance gap across socio-economic backgrounds.

      ii) Socio-economic vulnerability: Similarly, in 2010 there was a change in the methodology
          utilized to characterize socio-economic vulnerability for efficiency statistics, including
          KPI 3 that focused on repetition rates. Before, student vulnerability was defined according
          to five socio-economic categories ranging from “Very advantaged? to “Very
          disadvantaged? that were based on the results of socio-economic student surveys in
          relation to pre-specified criteria, with the proportion of students in each of these categories
          varying across categories as well as over time. From 2010 onward, students’ socio-
          economic vulnerability is being measured using quintiles, with each quintile having
          exactly twenty percent of all students. For the purpose of this ICR, efficiency statistics,
          including repetition for 1st and 2nd grade students and student socio-economic status is
          measured using quintiles for the entire series, with the data prior to 2010, including the
          baseline, being recalculated accordingly.

30.       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Utilization. M&E was effectively utilized to
monitor implementation progress, particularly in terms of progress toward expanding the FTS
model and achieving intermediate outputs. As envisioned at preparation, the various interventions
supported by the operation were subject to evaluations. The results were disseminated and used
for their continuous improvement. Concomitantly, the CEIP has monitored the performance of
individual FTSs, including efficiency and quality aspects, through its regular administrative
structure. The recent incorporation of new modules into the teacher training curricula to address
lower scores in math in 6th grade learning assessments serves as an illustration. However, the
challenge of developing an M&E system that serves policy makers to make data-driven decisions
is still pending, particularly in relation to student academic performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31.     Environmental Safeguards: Category was upgraded from Category “C? to “B? during
preparation. The QAG assessment commended the quality of the work done to integrate the
results of a particularly sound Environmental Assessment into the Operational Manual. The
implementation of the Project Environmental Plan was satisfactory, ensuring that the Project had
minimal or no adverse social or environmental impacts. The construction of new schools and
classrooms took place in urban areas on public land that did not involve protected areas or
ecologically fragile sites. Regarding resettlements, there was only one resettlement case involving
one individual occupying land to be used to build a new school, who was compensated.

32.      Financial Management – FM: FM arrangements were appropriate, with the PCU having


                                                    7
adequate financial management systems, software, and trained staff. A thorough FM assessment
was well documented in the Annex 6 to the PAD (Pages 74-75). FM risks were properly
identified, described and captured in the Project documents. While there were minor
shortcomings in FM, they did not prevent the timely and reliable provision of information
required for Project management, monitoring and implementation.

33.     Procurement: The Project procurement arrangements and action plans were adequate,
reflecting the recommendations of the Procurement Capacity Assessment. The PCU already had
ample experience on procurement aspects, particularly on Bank procurement procedures, as it was
responsible for the implementation of the two preceding operations.

34.   Compliance with Covenants: Although with delays, all covenants stipulated under the
Loan Agreement were met.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.     A follow-on operation (“Support to Uruguayan Public Schools Project?; P126408; Loan
No. 8198-UR; approved in September 2012) continues to provide support to the GoU in the
continuous expansion of the FTS model as a means to enhance equity, quality, and efficiency of
pre-school and basic education, particularly among more vulnerable population groups. In
addition, this operation provides technical assistance for the institutionalization of teacher in-
service training within CEIP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

36.     Relevance:       Pre-2006 restructuring – High / Post-2006 restructuring7 - High

37.     Objectives: Enhancing the quality of preschool and primary education was and continues
to be a top priority of Uruguayan authorities. The reform of the education sector has been referred
to as the "priority of priorities" by President José Mujica. One of the goals of the GoU’s current
education strategy is to improve the quality of education at all levels, which is being directly
supported by the MECAEP series8. Specifically, the FTS expansion is expected to be accelerated
drastically, with roughly 80 additional FTS schools being anticipated over the next four years.
Half of these schools are being financed under the follow-on Project, and the other with the
GoU’s own funds, underscoring the continuous relevance of the objectives of this operation.
Likewise, the Project is in line with the social inclusion and equity pillar under the current World
Bank Group's Country Partnership Strategy for the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (CPS 55863-
UY) that was discussed by the Executive Directors on October 14, 2010. Specifically, this
operation is fully aligned with the CPS objective of “supporting the Government's efforts to
increase equity, quality and efficiency in the provision of preschool and primary education."

38.     Design: The main focus of the operation was on the expansion of the FTS model, which


7
  The post-restructuring period includes both the 2006-2009 period within the original loan and the Additional
Financing (2010-2012) since the PDO and end-targets remained unchanged during the entire period.

                                                      8
continues to be a central strategy to enhance equity, quality and efficiency of education among
more vulnerable student groups, as shown by the decision of the current administration to double
the number of existing FTS schools during its term 9. Likewise, the relevance of in-service
teacher training, which was another core Project activity, is underscored by the GoU’s decision to
institutionalize it.

39.    Implementation: The Project’s restructuring contributed to maintaining the operation’s
relevance by distributing the Project’s benefits more widely among vulnerable student
populations in view of the more limited expansion of the FTS model that resulted because of the
budgetary constraints experienced during the 2002-2006 period. In addition, since south-south
collaboration is one of the objectives of the Uruguay Country Partnership Strategy, it is important
to underscore the interest that the implementation of Uruguay’s FTS model has generated among
other countries in the region such as Dominican Republic and Bolivia, to which the GoU has
provided technical assistance based on the Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

40.    PDO: The objective of the Project was to increase equity, quality, and efficiency in the
provision of preschool and primary education.

41.      To assess the Project’s achievement, this ICR relies on the operational definitions of the
three dimensions of the Project’s PDO provided in the Result Framework,10 as follows:
    i) Increase equity in the provision of preschool and primary education by expanding the full-
         time school model.
    ii) Improve the quality of preschool and primary education (ages 4 to 11) with a focus on
         socio-economically disadvantaged and very disadvantaged contexts.
    iii) Increase the efficiency of the preschool and primary education system with a focus on
         socio-economically disadvantaged and very disadvantaged contexts.

42.     Table 1 summarizes the achievement of results for each of the three dimensions of the
Project’s PDO, relying on evidence from the Project's key outcome indicators (KPIs), but also on
several supplementary indicators collected at the ICR stage. Achievements in terms of quality and
efficiency (KPI 2 and 3, respectively) are reported for students enrolled in: i) FTSs to assess the
Project’s achievement of the pre-restructuring period; and ii) both FTS and non FTSs, of the post-
restructuring period.

       End-vaues correspond to December 2011.

i) Increase equity in the provision of preschool and primary education by expanding the full-
   time school model.

43.    Through the expansion of the FTS model, the GoU has channeled substantial additional
resources to more disadvantaged student populations, enhancing equity in basic education. A total
of 868 FTS classrooms were built or rehabilitated under the Project, resulting in a significant
expansion of FTS enrollment (i.e., total FTS enrollment of over 40,000 students), particularly


                                                                10
among more vulnerable student population groups. FTSs received more resources than regular
schools. They operate over extended school hours and offer breakfast, lunch and snacks for
students. In addition, award-wining educational facilities, equipment and learning materials (e.g.,
computer and video equipment, library books, and learning materials) were provided to 175 FTSs
under the Project. Over 2,700 FTS teachers and administrators were trained in the FTS
pedagogical model (see Annex 2 for a detailed account of Component 1 outputs).

44.     The Project’s outcomes in relation to the expansion of the FTS model include:
 As of December 2012, there were a total of 40,156 students enrolled in 175 FTSs compared to
    21,419 students in 92 FTSs in 2002. It should be noted that the FTS installed capacity
    exceeded actual enrollment (i.e., 47,561 FTS student places versus 40,156 enrolled students)
    as the result of the GoU’s decision to limit classroom size to 25 students as a way to enhance
    quality.
 The proportion of FTS students with respect to total urban enrollment in pre-school and
    primary education almost doubled during the life of the Project, from 6.2 to 11.7 percent
    between 2002 and 2011.
 FTSs were increasingly targeted toward more disadvantaged students, with 47 and 52.7
    percent of the FTS students being in the lowest two quintiles in 2002 and 2011, respectively.
 As a result of the expansion of the FTS model and its targeting of vulnerable student
    populations, the FTS share of pre-school and primary students from the lowest two quintiles
    (Q1-2) more than doubled between 2002 and 2011—increasing from 7.4 to 15.4 percent.

45.     The Project’s achievement in relation to equity is considered to be moderate during the
pre-2006 restructuring period, as actual FTS enrollment (40,156 students) is significantly lower
than the original end-target of 87,000 FTS students. The Project is deemed to have had a
substantial impact in terms of enhancing equity in preschool and primary education during the
post-2006 restructuring period. At Project’s completion, actual FTS enrollment represented 85
percent of the revised end-target of 47,000 students. Moreover, complementary indicators indicate
that the expansion of the FTS model benefited in particular students from more disadvantaged
socio-economic backgrounds.

ii) Improve the quality of preschool and primary education (ages 4 to 11) with a focus on socio-
    economically disadvantaged and very disadvantaged contexts.

46.     In addition to the expansion of the FTS model, the Project supported interventions aimed
at enhancing the quality of basic education at the system level. Specifically, the Project supported
the development and implementation of a new pre-service teacher training curriculum and the
improvement of libraries and infrastructure of teacher training institutes. In addition, the Project
provided support to the strengthening of the M&E function for basic education, including the
implementation of standardized learning assessments for 6th grade students as well as
international assessments (i.e., UNESCO’s SERCE). These assessments are being used by GoU’s
to monitor and enhance teaching quality through, for example, expansion in the curricula of in-
service teacher training. In addition, the Project provided support to over 900 PMEs, which are
demand-driven educational initiatives proposed and implemented by individual schools.

47.    In the post-2006 restructuring period, the Project also supported school-level interventions
beyond the expansion of the FTS model, focusing on regular schools serving more vulnerable
student populations (i.e., PASs). In addition to the distribution of learning materials, the most


                                                11
significant activity was in-service teacher training, with an average of 1,480 PAS teachers and
administrators being trained annually between 2005 and 2009.

48.     The Project’s achievements in terms of quality of basic education are considered moderate
for both the pre-2006 restructuring and post-2006 restructuring periods. As reflected on Table 1,
academic performance as measured by the percentage of 6th grade students from disadvantaged
and very disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds performing at a satisfactory level in
standardized tests increased substantially for language skills over the life of the Project. The 61
percent end-target was exceeded by both FTS students (i.e., 64.8 percent) and FTS and PAS
students as a whole (i.e., 63.1 percent). However, the end-target was not met for math skills by
either universe of students, with performance in math actually deteriorating among FTS students
between 1999 and 2009.

49.     As noted earlier, standardized learning assessments were modified in 2005 and, therefore,
data for 1999 and 2009 are not fully comparable. Thus, changes in the performance gap by socio-
economic context—the so-called “equity gap?—were also examined to complement the original
indicators. A decrease in the equity gap11 between 1999 and 2009 indicates that improvements in
academic performance were more pronounced among students from disadvantaged and very
disadvantaged backgrounds, as intended under the Project. The only exception was in academic
performance in math among students from very disadvantaged backgrounds, where the
performance gap relative to their peers from highly advantaged socio-economic context actually
increased between 1999 and 2009 (see Table 1). Addressing the weaker math performance among
more vulnerable students groups has been identified as a priority by CEIP authorities. A study is
already under way to determine how the teaching of math skills can be further enhanced within
the FTS model.

50.      As shown on Table 1, academic performance was consistently higher among FTS students
relative to those in full-time and non FTSs as a whole. This indicates that FTSs have helped “pull
up? academic performance results among more vulnerable student groups in system-level
statistics, denoting the efficacy of the FTS model and, consequently, the Project’s effectiveness in
enhancing the quality of basic education through the expansion of the FTS model. This pattern is
consistent with the findings of previous studies. An extensive IE of the FTS model conducted in
2001-2002 showed that students from more disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds enrolled
in FTSs showed statistically better performance than their peers in language and math
competencies, such as text comprehension in language skills and concept comprehension in math
(ANEP, 2003). Similarly, a study that applied propensity score matching techniques to the same
set of data showed the FTS impact to be substantial: for a child who spent all 6 years of primary
school in an FTS, improvements in language and mathematics test scores reached on average 0.26
and 0.38 of a standard deviation, respectively (Cerdan-Infantes and Vermeersch, 2007).

iii) Increase the efficiency of the preschool and primary education system with a focus on socio-
     economically disadvantaged and very disadvantaged contexts.

51.     In addition to the expansion of the FTS model and the school-level interventions described


11
   The “equity gap? is defined as the difference between the percentage of students from very advantaged socio-
economic contexts and those from disadvantaged and very disadvantaged ones, respectively, performing at a
Satisfactory level.


                                                        12
above, the Project supported the creation of interdisciplinary teams to strengthen school-family
partnerships in 36 FTSs and 36 PASs. This initiative was later institutionalized within the CEIP.
In addition, the Project supported the implementation of a school management system to enhance
the quality and availability of school-based statistics, which was a predecessor of the current
information management system.

52.     The Project’s achievements in terms of efficiency of basic education are considered high
for the pre-2006 restructuring period and substantial for the post-2006 restructuring period. The
entire set of efficiency indicators (i.e., repetition, drop-out and insufficient attendance rates) has
improved considerably during the life of the Project, with the improvements being more drastic in
FTSs. Between 1999 and 2012, 1st grade repetition rates in FTS schools serving the two lowest
quintiles decreased from 23.2 to 12.8 percent, surpassing the 15 percent end-target. Likewise, 2nd
grade repetition rates in FTS schools serving the two lowest quintiles decreased from 17.1 to 6.1
percent, surpassing the 10 percent end-target. While 1st and 2nd grade repetition rates also
experienced a substantial decrease when considering both FTSs and non FTSs serving students in
the lowest two quintiles, the end-targets were met only for 2nd grade (see Table 1).

53.    FTSs also performed better than non FTSs in relation to drop-out and insufficient
attendance rates12 among students grades 1 to 6 from the lowest two quintiles, pointing to the
Project’s effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of basic education through the expansion of the
FTS model.

3.3 Efficiency

54.      Rating:           Pre-2006 restructuring – Modest               Post-2006 restructuring - Modest

Efficiency is considered to be modest before restructuring. Actual Project costs were substantially
higher than anticipated (roughly US$137 million compared to US$56 million anticipated at
appraisal). Likewise, some Project outputs were fewer than anticipated at appraisal (e.g., 40,156
compared to 87,000 FTS students anticipated at appraisal). This explains the difference between
the internal rate of economic return (IRER) estimated at appraisal (i.e., 37 percent) and the actual
one, which is estimated at 7.4 to 9.6 percent in conservative and high-impact scenarios (see
Annex 3).

55.    Efficiency is also considered to modest after restructuring. The Project’s estimated IRER
should be considered a lower bound given the myriad of positive externalities from the Project
that could not adequately be taken into consideration in the analysis, such as a faster flow of
students through the school system, expanded income-generation opportunities for mothers of
FTS students, and an enhanced sense of community.

56.     Higher Project costs were the result of higher construction costs and a change in the
operation’s strategy toward infrastructure at restructuring. Specifically, the ratio between
rehabilitation and new construction was reverted (i.e., from 70/30 percent to 35/65 percent),
resulting in a significant increase in construction costs, as a new classroom costs roughly three
times as much a rehabilitated one. There were also increases in construction costs that were

  Drop-out rates are defined as the percentage of students attending school 70 days or less. Insufficient attendance is
defines as the percentage of students attending school between 71 and 140 days out of a school year of 186 days.


                                                          13
exogenous to the Project, with unitary construction costs in dollars increasing by roughly 140
percent between 2002 and 2012 due, in large part, to a weaker dollar.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

57.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.     Relevance ratings are high for both the pre- and post-2006 restructuring periods. Efficacy
ratings are substantial for both periods. Finally, the Efficiency rating is modest for both periods.
The combination of these partial ratings yields an overall moderately satisfactory rating for both
periods (Table 2). In turn, the overall ratings for the two periods are weighted by the disbursement
percentages prior to and following the 2006 restructuring, yielding an overall weighted rating of
4.0–equivalent to moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

a) Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

59.     Poverty impact. Given the significant increase in poverty as a result of the regional
financial crisis, the Project’s focus on students at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum
became even more relevant. The Project was relevant not just from an educational perspective but
also a nutritional one, as it provided breakfast, lunch and a snack to children who otherwise might
not have been able to meet their nutritional needs, particularly at the peak of the crisis.

60.     Gender impact. While there is only anecdotic evidence since no data has been
systematically collected, mothers of children enrolled in FTSs report having been able to expand
their income-generating activities as a result of the longer school day.

61.     Social development. Outdoor spaces in newly constructed or renovated school buildings
have incorporated areas protected from the natural elements that provide free WIFI access not just
to students but to the entire community. This constitutes a major step toward bridging the so-
called “digital divide,? that is, economic inequality between socio-economic groups construed in
terms of access to, use of, or knowledge of information and communication technologies.

b) Institutional change and strengthening

62.     In addition to the continuous expansion of the FTS model, the Project has made an
important contribution by introducing a sound in-service teacher training program. Another
important contribution has been the strengthening of the student assessment function. Through the
financing provided to the PCU component and the studies carried out, the operation continued to
provide support for the unit created under the MECAEP I to conduct periodic assessments of
learning outcomes. This unit—DIEE—is now formally institutionalized within ANEP and is
responsible for the periodic application of national learning evaluations of all students in sixth
grade and the participation of the country in international evaluations (PISA 2003, PISA 2006,
SERCE), as well as the implementation of a school-based management information system that
collects data on teachers, students, and infrastructure.

c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts

63.     The excellence of the architecture financed under the Project has been recognized by
several awards and other distinctions, including representing Uruguay’s architecture in the 2009
Venice Biennale.13 In addition, Uruguay’s FTS model has received much attention within the
region. The PCU has played an important role disseminating the model and sharing the lessons
learned in regional forums as well as hosting delegations from other countries. Finally, anecdotic
but consistent reports from school administrators suggest that the FTSs have a positive impact
beyond the school limits, strengthening parents’ involvement with schools and strengthening the
sense of community around newly built schools.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

64.     Rating: Negligible to Low

65.      Overall, the risks that the outcomes achieved under the Project might not be sustained are
considered to be negligible to low. Project activities have been gradually absorbed by the regular
education institutions including the PMEs, the school-parents partnership program and the student
assessment function under DIEE. Likewise, the follow-on project is focusing on the
institutionalization of in-service teacher training. In terms of maintenance of civil works, the
follow-on project is helping ensure that the schools built or renovated under the Project receive
proper maintenance through two types of mechanisms focusing on larger and minor repairs,
respectively. In terms of recurrent costs, additional expenses arising mainly from salaries and
training have been financed through a gradual increase in the education budget. Given that GoU´s
spending in education as a proportion of GDP14 is lower than that of its neighbors in the region

   The architectural designs supported under the Project that have received special distinctions including: i) FTS No
92 in Barrio Lavalleja, participated in the 2009 Venice Biennale; FTS No. 375 in Santa Catalina, participated in the
VII Ibero-American Arch and Urbanism Biennale, Medellín 2010; FTS No. 330 in Maroñas, featured in OECD
(2001), Designing for Education – Compendium of Exemplary Educational Facilities;? FTS No. 213 in Jardines de
Pando, participated in the VIII Ibero-American Arch and Urbanism Biennale, Cádiz, 2012.

   Average per-student expenditure in primary and secondary schools is 7.2 percent of GDP per capita in Uruguay,
well below the regional average of 13.1 percent.


                                                         15
and to countries with a similar income, the gradual increase in spending can be expected to be
sustainable.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank’s Performance

a) Bank’s Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry - Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.     The Project benefited from a sound design that capitalized on the lessons learned from the
preceding operations and it incorporated regional and international experience. The Project’s
scope and focus reflected the GoU’s and Bank’s mature, long term vision of Uruguay’s basic
education system. The Bank team engaged in a fruitful dialogue with the GoU to define the
Project objectives and main actions to achieve them. The Bank’s performance had moderate
shortcomings, including not taking into consideration the macroeconomic risk and having overly
ambitious expectations at appraisal in terms the pace of implementation, expected outputs and the
overall impact over a five-year span.

b) Quality of Supervision - Rating: Satisfactory

67.      Project supervision was in-depth and permanent, benefiting from strong field support from
the Bank’s office in Argentina. The Bank carried out a minimum of two full supervision missions
per year and provided additional technical assistance in the areas of procurement and financial
management, as well as social and environmental safeguards. Aide memoirs and Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) provide detailed accounts of the progress being made, particularly during
the first half of the Project. Close communication between the GoU and the Bank, including
regular supervision missions with field visits to FTS schools throughout the country helped
identify the challenges being faced at various stages of project implementation. The Bank worked
closely with the GoU and provided the flexibility needed to achieve a successful implementation
of Project activities, including processing the Project’s four restructurings and an additional
financing in a timely way to adapt the Project activities to the changes in the policy and fiscal
reality in the country.

68.     The Bank’s supervision had some minor shortcomings related to Monitoring and
Evaluation. In retrospect, the Bank team should have provided more support in establishing clear
PDO definitions at restructuring, as well as in adjusting enrollment targets when the classroom
size limits were established. Likewise, monitoring of KPIs—particularly learning outcomes and
repetition rates—could have been strengthened, as the values reported from 2007 onward focused
on all students, regardless of their socio-economic background, which is not consistent with the
corresponding operational definitions.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank’s Performance - Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.    Overall Bank performance is considered moderately satisfactory (MS), given the MS
performance at quality at entry and satisfactory during supervision.

Borrower’s Performance

a) Government’s Performance - Rating: Satisfactory


                                               16
70.     The Project benefitted from the continuous support on the part of Uruguayan authorities,
including those in the CEIP. In particular, the FTS model has remained a priority strategy to
enhance equity, quality and efficiency in basic education under three different administrations.
The Ministry of Finance provided continuous financial support to the Project. While counterpart
funds were scarce between 2002 and 2006, this was the result of across-the-board budget cuts as
part of the fiscally responsible management required due to the economic crisis.

b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance - Rating: Satisfactory

71.     As noted in the QAG’s assessment, the ANEP exhibited a strong ownership of the Project
and actively contributed to its preparation. Top ANEP authorities have provided their full support
to the Project. The PCU was staffed with a team of top-notch professionals that had solid
credentials within the education sector and commanded respect among both authorities and
teachers. Coordination among the various areas within the PCU was very strong, which allowed
for the full integration of the pedagogical model with the construction and renovation of school
buildings that supported the FTS learning model. The Project also benefited from the continuity
of many professionals who launched implementation and in some cases, were members of the
original MECAEP I team. Since 2006, PCU technical staff were selected utilizing merit-based,
competitive selection processes and were subject to annual performance reviews.

72.     There were some minor shortcomings in the PCU’s performance related to Monitoring
and Evaluation. As illustrated by the Borrower’s contribution in this ICR, the way KPIs have been
reported by the Borrower do not reflect the original definition, as they focus on all students rather
than those from disadvantaged socio-economic contexts. A more fluid cooperation between the
CPU and the DEEI would have been desirable to ensure that the methodological changes that took
place in 2005 and 2010 did not hinder the PCU’s ability to report KPIs achievement and to utilize
the rich data being generated to further enhance the FTS expansion strategy and maximize the
model’s overall effectiveness.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower’s Performance - Rating: Satisfactory

73.    Overall, the Borrower’s performance is deemed satisfactory given the satisfactory
performance of both Government and the implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

a) Lessons of wide general application

74.    Incremental implementation over time contributes to sustainability. The GoU’s gradual
approach to converting schools to the FTS model over almost two decades has led to the
consolidation of the FTS as an integral part of state policies that transcend the efforts of the
various political administrations. Likewise, sequential operations offer great learning potential
and gradual capacity building.

75.    It is important to clearly align the KPI’s operational definitions with a Project’s PDO
and target population. The follow-on operation clarifies the ambiguities in the Project’s Results
Framework by explicitly stating that the Results Framework is focused exclusively on the FTS
model’s impact on equity, quality, and efficiency. It would be useful for all Bank projects to
include in the Project documents a detailed description of how the benchmark was calculated,


                                                 17
including the actual values utilized for the various data inputs.

b) Project-specific lessons

76.     Ensuring that FTSs are not just regular schools operating for extended hours is the
single most important challenge ahead to ensure the sustainability of the Project’s outcomes.
In view of ongoing FTS expansion, it is critical to strengthen quality assurance mechanisms,
including considering making in-service training mandatory for FTS teachers and administrators
as a condition for FTS eligibility as well as finding ways to reduce staff rotation in newly
established schools.

77.     It is critical to ensure the comparability of learning assessment results despite changes
in the underlying methodologies. Measurement techniques will continue to improve over time.
Thus, it is important to bridge methodological changes in a way that ensure that government
officials, administrators and society at large are able to monitor the quality of learning outcomes
over the medium and long term, without undermining transparency.

78.    A more focused targeting on disadvantaged and very disadvantaged students would
further enhance the efficiency of the FTS model. While avoiding a social stigma is clearly
desirable, there are also efficiency tradeoffs that need to be taken into consideration given the
higher cost of the FTSs relative to the traditional ones. In this regard, the decision to aim for 75
percent FTS enrollment of more vulnerable students under the follow-on Project is considered
appropriate. In addition, student selection criteria at the school level should become explicit and
more transparent.

79.    It is important to build user friendly tools to enhance data-driven decision making at
both the policy and the operational levels. Where there have been substantial advances in the
development of more sophisticated data, there is still the need to move forward on developing
more reliable information systems, monitoring and evaluation tools with a greater focus on
outcomes. This includes information systems for administrative data and student assessments,
such that reliable data is available to policymakers in a timely fashion. This is one of the areas of
focus under the follow-on Project.

80.     A robust IE of the FTS model could help further enhance its effectiveness. While earlier
studies point to the effectiveness of the FTS model, an in-depth IE would be useful to evaluate
cost and impact of the different components of the FTS model in order to optimize the roll-out
plan for future expansion. Three different evaluation studies are being programmed under the
follow-on Project.

     Achieved. A total of 868 new classrooms have been either built or rehabilitated under the Project,
     including 329 classrooms in new schools and 286 new classrooms in existing schools.
2.   Rehabilitation of rural schools with 30 students or more
     Achieved. A total of 14 rural schools rehabilitated. This activity was discontinued at restructuring.
3.   Furnishing approximately 850 FTS classrooms
     Achieved. A total of 868 classrooms were furnished.

     Achieved. All 175 FTSs were provided with a computer and printer.
5.   272 video equipment distributed to 34 FTSs
     Achieved. Video equipment was distributed as anticipated, plus 40 additional equipments distributed to
     schools with bilingual programs.
6.   280 sets of learning materials distributed to FTSs and Priority Attention Schools (CSCC)
     Achieved. One set per school.
7.   40 sets of bilingual learning materials distributed to selected FTSs
     Achieved. Schools with bilingual programs received these materials
8.   One set of library books and learning materials distributed to FTSs
     Achieved. Each of the 175 FTSs received a set.
9.   A textbook per child in 1st and 2nd grade produced and distributed.
     Achieved.
c. Teacher training on the full-time school model, new education technologies, and bilingual
   education
10. 1,900 educational personnel (i.e., principals, inspectors and teachers) trained in FTSs
    Achieved. A total of 2,785 educational personnel were trained in the FTS pedagogical model during
    2002-2012.
11. 2,100 educational personnel (i.e., principals, inspectors and teachers) trained in Priority-Attention
    Schools - PASs
    Achieved. An average of 1,480 personnel trained per year between 2005 and 2009.
12. 415 teachers trained in bilingual education program
    Achieved. A total of 415 teachers were trained in bilingual education. The program was later extended
    to include Portuguese in schools located in the border with Brazil. Program was institutionalized in 2006
    under the CEIP.
13. 700 educational personnel trained in the use of the educational software
    Achieved. The training was to support the implementation of an education information management
    system (secretarías escolares) to be operated by each school to manage data on students, teachers,
    and the school. A total of 1,489 educational personnel were trained utilizing the modality of cascade
    training. The program was later transferred to the CEIP in 2007, where it was eventually replaced by the
    current information management system “Guri.?
d. Strengthening the partnership between schools and parents
14. Creation of interdisciplinary support groups, with social profiles to strengthen the school-families
    partnerships in 36 FTSs and 36 Priority Attention Schools
    Achieved. The purpose of this program was to design, implement and evaluate the feasibility of
    expanding a model of technical assistance designed to generate the strengthening of integration
    between schools, families and the community to ultimately improve student’s educational achievements.
    The program, which was denominated “Vínculos.? was implemented in 36 ETC and 36 schools of
    critical socio-cultural context. It demanded a large number of specialized technical staff (i.e., social
    workers and psychologists), which made it impossible to extend it to all vulnerable schools. It was
    eventually transferred to the CEIP, which reconfigured it as multidisciplinary teams that operate at the
    departmental level under the so-called “Escuelas Disfrutables" Program.


                                                          21
e. Teachers’ compensation
15. Compensation of 60 full-time school teachers
    Achieved. A sub-component was added as part of the 2006 Project restructuring to provide a one-time
    cash transfer to CEIP to finance the salary differential corresponding to 60 teachers in five schools that
    had been converted to FTSs. The GoU was responsible for all other salary expenditures during the life
    of the Project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Economic Analysis: The economic analysis performed for the appraisal of the follow-on
operation provides a sound basis to estimate the economic efficiency of this operation, yielding an
internal rate of return between 7.4 percent and 9.6 percent (World Bank, 2012). These rates
should be considered a lower bound given the myriad of positive externalities from the Project
that could not be adequately taken into consideration, such as expanded income-generation
opportunities for parents of FTS students.

2.      The main benefits taken into consideration for the economic analysis include reductions in
repetition rates of students in primary and secondary school, reductions in student dropout in
secondary school, as well as improvements in the learning outcomes due to the improved quality
of service delivery. These improvements, in turn, are expected to shorten the number of school
years attained by the population and enhance the productivity of students. In order to assess the
corresponding economic impact of these improvements, reductions in the repetition and dropout
rates at all levels of education were estimated using the actual performance of FTS students.
Additionally, a post basic-education sequence was constructed based on a probit model with
information from the 2006 Expanded National Household Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares
Ampliada - ENHA). Results indicate that students that repeat a grade in basic education are 20
percent more likely to repeat a grade in secondary education.

3.       Besides improvements in the years of education among the FTS students, one of the most
important benefits was the improvement in education quality by year. In order to account for that
result, the analysis employed the results of Hanushek and Zhang (2006), for a total of 13 countries.
The benefits were adjusted to account for the improvements in quality under the Project. In turn,
higher education attainment is likely to be reflected in better life time income. Data from the 2011
ECH was utilized to construct the expected returns of education, which shows that in Uruguay, an
individual that achieves 17 years of education has an income that is more than twice the one from
someone with 0-4 years of education. It is expected that, as better-equipped students continue to
progress through the educational system, the Project will ultimately result in a decrease in the
number of individuals with low education attainment and an increase in the number of those with
high education attainment.

4.      It was estimated that the Project increased education costs per student from UY$371,044
to UY$475,961. In terms of benefits, given the higher education attainment of students due to
lower dropout rate, lifetime income is expected to increase from UY$1,644,291 to UY$1,700,682,
a total of UY$56,391. Given that it is expected that improvement in quality will increase labor
market productivity and therefore income, we adjust salaries upward, with an upper bound of
extra life time income of UY$194,829 (high impact) and a lower bound of UY$94,099
(conservative impact). Given these assumptions, the Project is expected to have generated an
IERR ranging between 7.3 and 9.6 percent. These rates should be considered a lower bound given
other likely positive externalities. On one side, it is likely that mothers of children in full time
schools would be more likely to participate in the labor market. Likewise, more educated citizens
are also expected to generate positive externalities, increasing the productivity of the overall
economy.

5.    Financial Analysis: The higher recurrent costs that arise mainly from salaries and training
have been financed through a gradual increase in the education budget over time. Given that

                                                23
Uruguay’s spending in education as a proportion of GDP is lower than that of its neighbors in the
region and other countries with a similar income (Specifically, the average per-student
expenditure in primary and secondary schools is 7.2 percent of GDP per capita, well below the
regional average of 13.1 percent), the gradual increase in spending can be expected to be
sustainable.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Introduction

1.     This report includes two operations, the original loan LN 7113-UR in the amount of
US$42 million, approved by the World Bank Board of Directors on April 25, 2002, and effective
on September 13 of the same year; and the Additional Financing LN 7789-UR in the amount of
US$29.9 million, signed by the Bank on February 24, 2010.

1.1.      Background

2.     The Government’s strategy for primary education has been supported by the World Bank
with the MECAEP Projects (Basic Quality of Education Improvement Projects), which aimed to
improve equity, quality, and efficiency in basic education.

1.2.       Implementing Agency

3.     From the beginning, the MECAEP III Project, later called PAEPU, was implemented by
one agency which over the years has increased in professionalization and specialization,
incorporating lessons learned along the way.

4.      In 2006, the MECAEP III Project was restructured, which resulted in focusing on two
areas where efforts could be concentrated, the construction/transformation of school buildings
and teacher training, improving interaction between both areas. As a result of this restructuring,
all of the project’s positions were advertised and an annual evaluation of staff performance was
carried out; the evaluations showed continued improvement. A coordination team holds weekly
meetings, integrating coordinators from all areas.

2.        Project Development Objectives

5.      The objective of the loan and additional financing was to increase equity, quality, and
efficiency in preschool and primary education through the following development objectives:

       a) Increase equity in preschool and primary education through the expansion of FTSs.
       b) Improve learning achievements for preschool and primary education in FTS.
       c) Increase the efficiency of the preschool and primary education system in FTS.

3.        Design and Implementation

6.     To achieve these objectives, the project was structured under two main areas and six
supporting areas.

3.1.      Main Areas

School Infrastructure

7.     This component consists of the production of physical infrastructure, which means
construction of new FTS buildings as well as rehabilitation and transformation of existing schools.

                                                 29
The type of intervention ranges from architectural projects to the supervision of works. FTS
buildings are considered to be a component of the educational process.

8.     The School Infrastructure component includes the design of local schools to allow the FTS
education model to be adequately put into practice.

9.      School buildings and educational model. The educational model defines schools as a
social place and a symbol for the community; teachers, children and families are the main users
and should make their schools their own. Each project is presented to the community where the
building will be constructed so that they can get to know it and make suggestions.

10.     Mobile and stackable furniture is supplied for classrooms and for each school’s kitchen-
dining area, principal’s office, and teacher’s lounge, as well as audiovisual and IT materials.
Finally, as all spaces are considered to be for educational purposes, external areas are designed
and equipped for this.

In-Service Teacher Training

11.    This component includes the design and implementation of In-Service Teacher Training
courses for full-time teachers. At the request of the CEIP, the first priority was for teachers
working schools in Critical Social-Cultural Contexts (CSCC); this has now been extended to
teachers in all areas.

12.    Alongside the implementation of the first FTSs –whose guidelines can be found in
Resolution No. 21 of Act 90, December 24, 1998, an in-service training program was
implemented for teachers in these schools.

   This number is the amount of trained teachers. A teacher who decides to train in-service must have completed Course I and can
 only do the course once.
 b
   This number is the amount of courses passed by teachers who trained. Each teacher had the opportunity to do more than one
 course in the Training in Service.


13.    From the beginning of FTS, the project has designed and implemented the following
courses through its In-Service Training Area, with the pass rates shown in Table 1.

         Course I “Implementing the Educational Approach of FTS.? The aim of this course is to
          accompany the implementation process of the FTS model, which means thinking about
          development and beginning the path to change.
         Course II “Improving Teaching Strategies in Social and Natural Sciences and Language.?
          70 course hours and two projects totaling 140 hours, including two annual visits to the
          FTS where the participants work.
         Course III “Improving Math Instruction.? Math 1.
         Pilot Course 2012 “Ensuring Quality Graduates from Primary School.? This is for school
          directors and 6th grade teachers in FTS schools and the APRENDER Program. This
          course has four main areas: Reading, writing, presentation, and argumentation.
         During 2010 and 2011, the course “Language, Math, Natural and Social Sciences
          Teaching in Depth? was carried out.

3.2.      Supporting Areas

14.    The Project included the following support areas: Procurement, Financial Management
and Disbursements, Legal Advice, Programming and Monitoring, Equipment and IT Support.


                                                                     31
4.     Measuring of Results

4.1.   Development of Indicators

15.     Objective 1 (Improve equity of primary education offer, through the expansion of the Full-
Time School mode) was measured using information from project records together with CEIP’s
Full Time Coordination. Objective 2 (Improve learning achievements in pre-school and primary
education in FTS) and Objective 3 (Increase pre-school and primary education system efficiency
in FTS) were measured through annual studies in the Research, Evaluation and Statistics Division
(DIEE) of the National Public Education Administration (ANEP). This institution publishes the
annual Primary Teaching Educational Monitor, which reports information for the all primary and
pre-school public schools (urban and rural). The project used this annual information to follow
these indicators.

4.2.   Intermediate Indicators

16.    The intermediate indicators were measured using information from project records
together with CEIP’s full-time coordination, with the exception of the indicator Learning
Evaluations in 6th Grade, which was measured using the information published in “Learning
evaluations in Language, Math and Science in 6th grade of primary teaching? from the DIEE.

5. Achievement of Objectives

17.    Loan LN 7113-UR and the additional financing LN 7789-UR, as mentioned above, shared
the same development objectives.

5.1.   Loans LN 7113 – UR and LN 7789 – UR

18.    The development indicators show that the objectives were fully achieved.

5.2.   Loan LN 7113-UR

19.     Loan 7113-UR had a series of objectives which were, according to measurements from the
corresponding indicators, considered to be fulfilled in the year 2009. Following are the activities
carried out and the objectives achieved between 2002 and 2009.

School-level Interventions Aimed at Increasing Education Quality in Schools With Students in
Unfavorable Socioeconomic Contexts

20.    (a) Production and distribution of textbooks: Since 1994 the MECAEP I Project has
organized opportunities for editors to present text book proposals for each school grade, and in
2002 this was repeated for pupils in grades 1 and 2.

21.   (b) In-Service teacher training in FTS and in priority schools (CSCC): Since 2005,
CEIP’s request, courses for teachers in CSCC schools have been organized. Between 2006 and
2009 this was extended to the whole country, with an average of 1,480 teachers per year
completing the training in discipline and education in the four areas in four years.



                                                32
22.      (c) Teaching training in the bilingual education program: 34 FTSs were initially included
in an English immersion program for which 415 teachers were selected and trained; this program
was then extended to Portuguese for schools bordering Brazil. In 2006, this component was
institutionalized in CEIP in the Second Language department that oversees content.

23.     (d) In-service teacher training in educational IT programs: The project had a component
called School Secretaries. Its aim was to equip all schools having more than 50 pupils with a
computer and printer for use in the school’s administrative management. An IT system was
developed for school secretaries to run the school administration in three areas: students, officials
and establishment. The school director and one teacher per school, as well as two officials from
Departmental Inspection, were trained. The training was broken down through Inspections,
reaching 1,489 teachers. This program was never universal, since the teaching body felt it wasn’t
part of their activity and the move to CEIP in 2007 generated a new system called “GURI.?

24.     (e) Creation of interdisciplinary support groups, with social profiles to strengthen the
school-family link: The specific objectives of this program aimed at: (i) improving
communication and increasing mutual understanding between teachers and families of
participating FTS students; (ii) increasing family involvement in the education provided by these
schools; (iii) increasing the links between these schools and other organizations and community
services and facilitating families’ access to them. The program was implemented in 36 FTSs and
in 36 critical socio-cultural context schools. It was eventually transferred to CEIP, which created
cross-functional teams on a departmental level. It’s currently known as the “Enjoyable Schools
Program.?

25.     (f) Payment of FTS teachers: In 2006, a monetary transfer was made to CEIP to cover that
specific period for the transformation of 60 teachers’ working hours from 20 hours to 40 hours,
corresponding to the following transformed schools: No. 35 in Durazno, No. 175 in Montevideo,
No. 35 in Rocha, No. 118 in San José, and No. 3 in Tacuarembó.

Institutional Strengthening

26.    Evaluation of teacher training system: An external evaluation was carried out by
researchers José Fernández, Fernando Filgueira and Carmen Midaglia of the CIESU.

27.     Development of the new program before teacher’s work and in-service training of teacher
trainers: The current director of the Education Training Council, Mag. Edith Moraes, was
responsible on behalf of the MECAEP Project for the creation of a new plan for initial teacher
training, which was delivered and implemented by the CODICEN at the time. Before
implementation, 543 teachers from the Teacher Training Institutes were trained in the new
program.

28.    Improvement of libraries and infrastructure in Teacher Training Institutes: 3,300 books
were delivered to 23 Teacher Training Institutes or Institutos de Formación Docente – IFD. The
IFD in Pando was designed and built. This was a project by Architect Lucía Lombardi which was
completed in March 2009.

29.   Development and implementation of Education Improvement Projects (Proyectos de
Mejoramiento Educativo – PME): Education Improvement Projects (PME) began with previous

                                                 33
financing and continued to be implemented until the end of Loan 7113. This program promoted
the identification of opportunities for improvement in schools; the proposed improvements would
be presented as projects, and for each proposal favorably evaluated the school concerned would
receive financing for the improvement. As a result, 912 PMEs were carried out.

Monitoring of the Educational Program: A “Social Evaluation of FTSs study? was carried out by
Equipos Mori.

6. Financial performance: Loan 7789

30.    Total spending as of December 31, 2012, reached US$63,310,448, which represents 169%
of the PAD. Total accumulated IBRD spending was US$29,900,000, which is equal to 100
percent of the PAD for that source of financing.

7. Financial Performance: Loan 7113

31.    Total spending for loan No. 7113 was US$70,833,262, reaching 100 percent
disbursements from IBRD and 126 percent from the local counterpart. Resources that were
designated for interventions in schools in unfavorable contexts represented 82 percent of the total
budget, with the remaining 18 percent going to the institutional strengthening component.

8. Procurement Processes

8.1    Works: Loan 7789

32.     Through the additional financing of Loan Nº 7789, 32 major works were carried out. 14
schools were built in new buildings, of which 11 correspond to FTS creations and 3 to
substitutions of existing school buildings, making the additional transformation of 17 schools to
FTSs possible as well as the rehabilitation of an existing FTS. This allowed school capacity to
increase to 9,420 places.

33.    Equipment (ICB and NCB) – Loan 7789. As part of the additional financing, loan No.
7789, in 2011 a total of 6 national competitive bids were carried out for the procurement of
equipment in the amount of US$580,324; when added to the 3 international public bids, the total
amount for 2011 came to US$1,411,897.

9. Impact of Project Implementation

34.     The implementation of the project consolidated a school model that had been initiated in
previous projects. It is particularly important that the evolution of the architectural projects was
due to the permanent and productive interaction between architects and teaching staff.

35.    During the course of the operation, the project grew from a set of different components to
focusing on two components (School Infrastructure and In-Service Teacher Training) which dealt
with the same issues from different points of view.




                                                34
36.    There are currently 47,651 student places in existing FTSs. If we consider that there are
approximately 38,000 enrolled students, these represent 13 percent of the urban student register
2,785 FTS teachers have been trained in one or several of the courses offered.

37.    Over the last few years, the Project’s visibility has increased considerably with the
publication of two books: Una escuela dispuesta al cambio – Diez años de Formación en Servicio
(“A school willing to change – Ten Years of In-Service Training?); and Escuelas de Tiempo
Completo en Uruguay (“Full Time Schools in Uruguay?). The first book analyzes the In-Service
Training experience from the beginning, and the second tells the story of the School Infrastructure
experience in its different components.

9.1 Factors That Affected Results

38.    The number of FTSs has increased considerably over the last few years (45 new FTSs
since 2010), including schools from disadvantaged and very disadvantaged socioeconomic
contexts. This increase has impacted the evolution of performance indicators.

39.    During the administration before CEIP, in 2008, full-time inspections were eliminated and
as a consequence hiring processes were no longer carried out for teachers, directors, and
inspectors who aspired to work in FTS. The existence of this National Inspection gave unity and
continuity to the implementation of the model as well as training for the teachers involved, which
disappeared with this institutional change. There is currently a high incidence of staff rotation,
which is not conducive to the implementation of the model.

10.      Lessons learned

10.1     Lessons Regarding the School’s Relationship with the Community

40.     The Inspection’s visit to determine together which schools are to be created or
transformed is a practice that has been evaluated as highly positive. The presentation of projects
to the community has been evaluated as positive as well. Both practices should be maintained.

10.2     Lessons Regarding the Architectural Program

41.     The architectural and educational spaces are closely linked. The project has held
discussions on educational issues whose conclusions also took into account the architectural
issues, as follows:

      i) Coexistence of construction work with the schools’ functioning. This made room for
         negotiation between the parties involved, resulting in, for example, the demarcation of
         exclusion zones or making known the progress of the construction. The visits made by the
         children to the sites allowed them to appropriate the school building from the start and
         during the process.

      ii) During the project’s implementation, several maintenance tasks were carried out in FTS
          that were financed by the local counterpart. As a result of this experience, the new loan
          incorporated preventive and corrective maintenance activities.



                                                 35
10.3   Lessons Regarding In-Service Training

42.    In the In-Service Training area, it was understood that the courses were too demanding in
terms of the number of hours required, so a reduction in face-to-face training has been proposed,
and distance learning activities considered, such as forums through an IT platform.

43.    The benefits of voluntary enrollment into the In-Service Training courses is another lesson
learned that is worth considering, since adults do not learn if they are not willing to study.

44.    Regarding implementation of the educational model, in-service training contributed to the
development of relevant aspects of the same. For example:
     Teaching staff meeting. The organization of the teaching staff meeting is aimed not only at
       considering existing issues, but also at identifying situations that could potentially have a
       negative effect on the functioning of the school in terms of education and to process the
       discussion and reach agreements on actions to be taken.
     Coexistence and links between those who share school life are an essential part of
       education. One way to participate is through class assemblies, delegate assemblies or
       general assemblies; these are work mechanisms that have been incorporated into FTS life.

10.4   Lessons Regarding the Distribution of Teaching Material

45.     The way books and teaching materials are delivered has changed. Schools are given the
money to buy books and teaching materials, and the Full-Time Coordination provides a list of
suggested books and materials. In this way, the purchases are made according to the needs and
reality of each FTS.

10.5   Lessons Regarding Environmental Safeguards

46.     Environmental safeguards have been applied to make environmental improvements to
buildings. In this regard, experiments, analyses, and evaluations have been undertaken on some
constructions. The devices used aim to improve water management (gray water, black water, and
rain water), energy rationalization, air quality, noise control, and waste disposal. Innovative
practices have been adopted, such as the use of renewable energy, environmental regulation
control and the teachable use of solar heaters. One aspect to be resolved is the incorporation of
solar heaters into the school design.

10.6   Lessons Regarding Financial Management and Other Administrative Procedures

47.    Since 2012, entry to the Integrated Financial Information System has been the
responsibility of the local counterpart. This has meant a reduction in the time taken to award
contracts and a reduction in the time it takes to pay companies, as well as greater control of the
money available in the project. A review of key procedures was made, and the improvement was
considered to have a positive impact on the project’s functions. An analysis, simplification, and
computerization of this information was carried out and implemented in all cases.

11.    Bank Performance




                                                36
48.     The World Bank has carried out two supervision missions each year, which has meant
positive collaboration with the PCU and education department authorities. The supervision
missions were carried out thoroughly, based on implementation reports made by the PCU, and
they generally resulted in recommendations and positive input that were favorable to the project’s
progress.

49.      The task managers who have participated over the life of the project, as well as the
different specialists that have participated in different aspects of it, have shared with the
institution important development and implementation expertise in a spirit of cooperation to
provide support in the constant challenges that have presented themselves. However, this
partnership could have been strengthened by having a greater degree of permanence in terms of
task managers.

50.     The current task manager, who joined the team in 2011, actively participated and shared
his experience, making himself available at all times in the process of closing the current project
as well as in the preparation of the new loan that will provide continuity to the FTS model.

51.     The Bank has been flexible and understanding when correcting problems that have been
observed and including suggestions for issues that hadn’t originally been foreseen, such as the
need to amplify the loan as a result of the changes in economic context and infrastructure
objectives.

52.    At all stages of the project, since its identification and preparation, the production of the
PAD, and during project supervision, the IBRD administration has been highly satisfactory and
has been a great support to the team.

53.    The World Bank office in Montevideo has also provided excellent support, through the
representatives and staff, as an intermediary and through the use of its offices, especially for
videoconferences.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

With regard to the “Completion and Results Report for the Third Support to Uruguayan Public
Schools Project, Loans 7113-UY and 7789-UY,? Project Unit makes the following comments:

   1. First, we are sending you the corresponding data for 2012, extracted from the Monitor
      Educativo report:

                Indicator                                  Actual value – Dec. 2012 
                Repetition rates 
                   1st   Grade 
                     Full?time schools                               12.8 %
                     Full?time and non?full?time schools             18.5 %
                   2nd  Grade 
                     Full?time schools                                6.1 %
                     Full?time and non?full?time schools              9.7 %
                Drop?out rates 
                     Full?time schools                                1.0 %
                     Full?time and non?full?time schools              1.5 %
                     Insufficient attendance rates
                     Full?time schools                                8.3 %
                     Full?time and non?full?time schools              9.8 %

   2. The new maximum enrollment per classroom set by the Preschool and Primary Education
      Council (CEIP) is 25 students and not 24 as stated in the document.

      In Table (a) Indicators of Project Development Objectives (page iv), for Indicator 3 we
      suggest that the comments should include the results obtained for full-time schools (FTS),
      as done for Indicator 2.

   3. In paragraph 1.6 Revised Components:

      ?   Point (i) In 2006, the expansion of the FTS model was discontinued in urban and rural
          zones. The discontinuation was only for rural schools, since these already have an
          extended day and the FTS model is for urban schools.
      ?   Point (v) Training for bilingual teachers increased as of 2006. This activity became an
          institutionalized component.
      ?   Point (vi) In 2006, the training of education personnel was reduced. This was not so;
          at no time during the project was there a reduction in the training of personnel.
      ?   Point (vii) The extension of the work day, which before 2006 only applied to teachers
          in FTS, was instituted in priority schools after that year. The extension entailed the
          incorporation of a paid monthly meeting for the teaching staff.

   4. Paragraph 20. Weakening of quality control mechanisms. Competitive selection was based
      on contests and the merit of teachers, not just merit.


                                                     38
5. Paragraph 49. Where it says table 2, it should say table 1.

6. Paragraph 51. Adjusted according to 2012 data: It is felt that the achievements of the
   project, in terms of the efficiency of basic education, were significant during the period
   prior to the 2006 restructuring and substantial during the subsequent period. All the
   efficiency indicators (that is, repetition, drop-out, and insufficient attendance rates) have
   improved during the life of the project and the improvements were more significant in FTS.
   Between 1999 and 2012, repetition rates in the first grade of FTS, which serve the two
   lowest quintiles, were reduced from 23.2 percent to 12.8 percent, hence the ultimate target
   of 15 percent was surpassed. In addition, repetition rates in the second grade of FTS,
   which serve the two lowest quintiles, were reduced from 17.1 percent to 6.1 percent, hence
   the ultimate target of 10 percent was also surpassed. Repetition rates for the first and
   second grade also decrease considerably when both FTS and non-FTS that serve students
   from the two lowest quintiles are taken into account. This improvement facilitated the
   achievement of the target in the second grade, though not in the first grade. (see table 1)
