                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A Project restructuring to reallocate funds from Works and Goods to Training and Consultant's services was approved on July 2, 2012. The proposed reallocation was necessary to
                         finance: (i) existing and newly created additional in-service teacher training courses, (ii) the contracting of more teacher trainers than estimated at the beginning of the Project; and
                         (iii) additional technical advisers hired to work in the preparation and supervision of works at Full-Time Schools.
