                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well towards achieving its Project Development Objectives. As of May 2011, 138 Full Time Schools (FTS) have been created through the Project. Since the
                         project started, a total of 38,130 student places have been added in FTS (81 percent of project target). The Project's Action Plan for 2011 includes 480 additional student places that
                         will allow to have a total of 38,610 student places (82 percent of project target) at the end of the calendar year. The Project also continued the in-service training for teachers in FTS
                         and as of May 2011 it has trained 2,108 teachers (10.9 percent above the project target), and also supported in-service training activities for teachers who work in regular schools in
                         the country.
