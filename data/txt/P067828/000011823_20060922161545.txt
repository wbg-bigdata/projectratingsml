Chapter 1 Background and Reasons of Site Change
1.1 Background
The site of Jiangsu Rudong 25MW Straw Power Pilot Project originally located at
the planning construction land of Mabei Village in Matang Town of Rudong County.
However, because  "Tieben-iron mill" event occurred in Jiangsu, the state stopped the
approval of construction land for Jiangsu province. It is hard for the project company to get
the approval from the state for original Mabei site scheme, which will certainly affect the
project progress. Under the above condition, the project company tried to identify a new
site which is appropriate for the project and kept away from farmland. At the same time,
Juegang Town People's Government invited the project owner and offered the idle land in
Mingxing Construction Material Company Ltd. for the construction land. In view of the
reasons above (See the follows for details), the final location is changed inside the plant
area of Mingxing Construction Material Company Ltd..
1.2 Site Change Reason
The original site located at Mabei Village Matang Town , Rudong County. The
project site was moved to the land of closed Mingxing Construction Material Company Ltd.
for the following reasons:
1.2.1 To keep away from the agricultural land, especially farmland as far as possible, and
will not affect the project construction progress;
(1) After Jiangsu "Tieben-iron mill" event, the state stopped the approval of
construction land for Jiangsu province. If original Mabei site is submited for approval, the
project construction progress will certainly be affected
(2) Because the Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd. is a clay brick mill, by the
relative rules of document (No.2002-42) of Jiangsu Province People's Government, it
stipulates that simple kiln under 18 portals for illegally earth excavation existing safety risk
with lagged technology shall be closed. Juegang Town People's Government closed the
mill in Nov. 2004, so that 92mu land inside the mill become as idle land. At the same time,
4



Juegang Town People's Government invited the project owner - Jiangsu Provincial Guoxin
Investment Group ltd. to submit to Jiangsu Province National Land Recourse Department
to transfer 92mu land for the project use.
(3) During the period of the national land protective policy, the land policy is
compelled for implementation, and more land be occupied by the original scheme, it is hard
to get the approval from the state. But the new site is on the idle land in Mingxing brick
mill, not use farmland and easy for land use application.
1.2.2 To reduce resettlement impact
There is no resident living in the idle land, therefore there is no house relocation
problem; At the same time, the project uses idle land without land acquisition for farmland,
so that it will not be concerned with resettlement problem.
1.2.3 Other favorable factors
(1) located near No.223 provincial road, transportation of new site is convenient;
(2) It is surrounded by waters on three sides. This can guarantee the water supply for
the power station operationt;
(3) The project site is close to the fire department, only 3km away, so that the safe
operation of the power plant can be rather highly guaranteed.
(4) The project constructed in the new site could save the costs of house rehabitation,
resetllement and compensation, therefore to reduce the project investment.
In view of the above reasons, the project site is changed to the plant area of Mingxing
Construction Material Company Ltd..
5



Chapter 2 Main Change Occurred in the New Site
Surrounded by water from three sides, the new site locates in Yinxin Village,
Juegaing Town, Rudong, Jiangsu. Provincial No.223 road running from south to north
is 280 meters away to the east. The grounding work has been completed. The land is
flat with grade elevation 4.3m (Huanghai elevation). Maximum flood level in
100-year and 50-year occurrence is 3.69m( frequency 0.1%), wave height frequency
2%. It is not necessary to establish flood proof pump stations.
Compared with the Feasibility Study Report dated October 2004 ( the Original
Report) , the supplement includes the following changes:
2.1 Main change inside the plant
2.1.1 Plant Area
The new site occupies 92 mu (6.13hm2) , which is 10% reduction of the original
site 100 mu (6.660hm2). The project company had got Land Use Right Certificate for
the new site.
2.1.2 Change of Straw Transportation Mode
There is significant difference between transportation modes by land and by
water. The original site has Mafeng River in the west side for navigation and roads in
the east and south sides for land transportation. Provincial No. 223 road running from
south to north is 280 meters away to the east of the new site. Jiuyao River locates onto
the north side of the new site. Since the navigating canal has not been dredged for a
long time, water transportation capacity is getting weaker year by year. Moreover, the
navigation capability is greatly reduced by the water surface plants which are in large
group due to the river eutrophication. The draft of boat will be shallow because of the
low density of straw. The clear height of many small bridges limits the load of boats,
which increases the transportation cost of straw. On the contrary, the project site area
has developed highway network to each village. Therefore, the project company
proposed to transport straw by land exclusively. Port for l00t boat (indoor harbor pool)
described in the original Feasibility Study Report is replaced by a small port with 5
tons stationary rotary hoisting machine for ash, raw materials and other auxiliary
6



materials.
2.1.3 Modification of Plant Layout
2.1.3.1 No port for straw transportation
There is no port for straw transportation because the straw will not be transported
by water.
2.1.3.2 The original enclosing wall surrounding the plant is replaced by fence wall on
one side and riverbanks on three sides.
The new site is surrounded by water on three sides. North boundary reaches
Jiuyao River. Yao River surrounds the new site on the west and north sides. The river
bank shall be built (total length 660m, the cost is covered in the project's total
investment estimation) instead of fence wall.
2.1.3.3 Factors conceming the passageway for people and materials, and location of
water intake shall be modified accordingly.
Therefore, the plant layout was amended (see attached drawing).
2.1.4 Adjustment of Straw Storage inside the Plant
There is no modification to the storehouse structure but the reduction of
construction area from 3960m2 to 3797.76m2. Hoisting machine will still be used.
Stack height is 6.4m  for four straw bales (size: 250 X 120 X 80cm; density:
200kg/m3; bale weight: 450550kg). The storehouse may hold 3204 straw bales,
totally weight 1600t, for about three day's consumption. There is no change of the
conveying equipment from the storage to the boiler house.
2.1.5 Change of water intake and drainage
The Original Report specifies that the plant could intake water from Mafeng
River situated at the northwest comer of the plant. Jiuyao River on the north side of
the new site could supply water for the plant. Industrial supply water of 290t/h
indicated in the Original Report is too large. In order to carry out the state policy on
energy saving and water resource, innovations have been taken in water supply
system and water cycling system. Water supply system, flow balance and water intake
pump are required to be adjusted. (See 2.3.1 )
7



2.2 Main change occurred outside the plant
2.2.1 Straw purchase and storage facilities
It is described in the Original Report that a straw collection company would be
established to collect straw. The straw collection company has 10 straw collection
stations which will not be invested by the power plant, but sale straw to the power
plant. In order to ensure the reliable fuel supply, the power plant proposes to establish
five strawcollection stations. No straw collection company will be established
(Construction costs of five straw collection stations are included in the project's total
investment estimation). The power plant owns the properties of five stations.
Therefore, 10 straw collection stations described in the Original Report will not be
built. Five straw collection stations built by the plant will be operated by the
contractors. Straw will be collected and supplied to the power plant throughout the
year.
(1) Site selection of five straw collection stations
The central collection station locates on the south side of the access road to the
plant. It is close to the eastern part of the enclosing wall of the plant, which facilitates
straw conveying to the storehouse inside the plant. Sites of other four stations will be
selected in the following four towns: Bencha, Xindian, Yangkou and Chahe. The
project company will select the sites which have no rehabilitation, less farmland,
enjoy convenient transportation and have water for fire proof.
(2)Structure, capacity and functions of straw collection stations
(X) Central station: Storehouse has steel structure, large enclosure shed made
from color steel. The construction has been completed. The station occupies an area of
20 mu with a construction area of 5265m2, and has a straw storage capacity of 5000t.
The project company started the official formality for land acquisition for the station
in March 2006. The Red Line Drawing (confining the station area) and the Proposal
for Station Site Selection have been approved by the Construction Bureau and the
application materials have been submitted to the state land administration. At present,
the land used for the central station is by renting agreement. The central straw
station has functions of straw collection, storage and transiting.
© Other four straw collection stations: The storehouses are planned to be built
in steel structure with semi-enclosure shred. Each station will have an area of about
8



16mu, about 64mu in total for four stations. Covering the total construction area of
14446m2, four stations have a straw storage capacity of 14000t in total. Once the site
selections are completed, the project company will perform relevant land acquisition
procedures and try hard to have the lands listed within the scope of the planned
construction land of the county in 2007.
(  Totally owning the building area of 19711 M2, five straw collection stations
have a maximum capacity of about 19000t. Based on the annual turnover time of 4,
the total straw collection quantity will reach 7.6 X 104 t. Straw collectiond in five
straw stations could meet the fuel demand of the plant for nearly half year.
(1) Additionally, straw fuel will be kept in the farmer's haystacks and be
collected by the peasant brokers who will sign the Sales Contracts with the project
company to supply fuel for the plant as scheduled to ensure the fuel supply of the
power plant. Straw collected by five straw collection stations and fuel collected by the
peasant brokers will replace the scheduled fuel collected by ten straw collection
stations described in the Original Report and meet the fuel demand of the power plant.
2.2.2 The power will be integrated into the grid through Juenan transforming
station instead of Matang transforming station. The direct line is 3km long
(construction line 4.4km) while the line for the original site is 800m long. Investment
estimation will increase from RMB 2.1 Million to RMB 7.11 million (see Investment
Estimation Table)
2.3 Modifications to Specific Components
2.3.1 Engineering Water Part
There are two water resources for the original site. One is from municipal water
system; the other is the surface water of Mafeng River. For the new site, daily life
water and chemical water are supplied by tap water system; surface water is from
Jiuyao River on the north side of the plant.
Industrial supply water of 290t/h indicated in the Original Report is too large. In
order to carry out the state policies on energy saving and water resource, innovations
have been taken in water supply system and water cycling system. The estimated
maximum water demand is 97m3/h. Measures are described above:
(1) Four cycling water pumps are emplaced in the pump house. Parameters of
9



the pumps: 3 sets : Model 500S-22, Q=2020m3/h, H=22m, N=185kw, motor
Y355m2-6/380v. 1 set: Model 500S-20A, Q=1400m3/h, H=20m, N=132kw, motor
Y315L2-6. The cycling water could be operated economically.
Cycling water system use pipe units with head pipes and branch pipes. The head
pipes are made from D1220 X 10 pressure steel.
There is a set of high energy atomic water supply system with variable frequency
in the pump house for water supply of the plant. Parameters: Model: QBWS-1-140
-40-3LG; Q=140m3/h, H=40m, N=l 1kw X 3.
In order to improve the repeatability of water usage, the cycling water system has
a 150m3/h bypass filter, dosing devices for corrosion inhibitor, fungicide and algae
killer.
(2) Water supply system
Industrial water and cycling water are supplied by river water, which is
pretreated before its usage. Maximum feed water demand is reduced to 97m3/h from
290m3/h. A pump house is to be built at the side of the river. Two water supplying
pumps are emplaced in the pump house, one is for normal use, and the other one is for
spare. Parameters for the pumps. ISG100-160F; Q=12Om3/h, H=28m, N=15kw. Two
other pumps for fire protection are also emplaced in the pump house. Grate and rotary
strainer are used at the water intake site to remove floating matters and ensure the
cleaning efficiency.
A water cleaning station is included in the water supply system. By the report of
water quality provided by the project company, oxygen-consumption of the water is
16- 122mg/L, which means that the water is polluted. According to this, the
water-cleaning station has a 120 m3/h insolated biology-filtering pond plus a 120
m3/h high effective slope sedimentation pond. Applying this technique, the water
pollution can reach a level less than 4 degree. The water is free of oxidizer, which
effectively prevents the anion resin in the chemical water workshop from being
polluted. Some of the water from the sedimentation pond flows to the 300m3
industrial water pond, the left part flows to water pond of the cooling tower.
A comprehensive pump house is also included in the water supply system. Two
back-wash pumps are emplaced in the pump house, one for normal use, and the other
is for spare. Parameters of the pumps: Model 300S-12, Q=900 m3/h, H=1Om, N=37kw.
10



The pump house also has dosing room for coagulant and draft fan room.
(3)The whole drainage system is designed under a distributing strategy: Rain
water is collected by pipes and conducted into Yao River and Jiuyao River; life
wastewater is collected and sent to wastewater disposing station. Quantity of supplied
water for the power plant is reduced to 97m3/h from 290m3/h.

(4) No modification has been made to a hyperbola natural-aeration
circle-cooling tower (F=1 250 mi3) and fire protection system of the power plant.
2.2.3 Electric Engineering Part
It is described in the Original Report that the generated power is to be integrated
into Matang transforming station which is 800m away through an 110KV line. For the
new site, the power from the plant will be integrated into Juenan transforming station
(4.4m away) through an 110KV line.
2.3.3 Civil works part
(1) Geological difference between the original site and the new one will not
affect the preparation proposal for ground basis of the buildings.
(2) Only the following modifications are made to the main buildings:
(1); Harbor pool (span 18m; length 50m; depth of river bed 4.5m) is replaced by
a small dock equipped with 5t rotary hoisting machine.
(©) Area of straw storage house is reduced to 3798m2 from 3960m2. No change
is made to the structure.
2.3.4 Technical and economic analysis
It has been one and half years since 2004. There are significant changes of
material price, exchange rate, the level used to estimate the investment statically, and
annual income etc. Therefore the investment estimation and economic analysis are
based on the data of this year and all changes of the new site. (See Chapter 7)
12



Chapter 3 Analysis on Market and Risk of Straw Power
3.1 Risk of fuel supply
The risk of fuel supply will be reduced. The state issued the documents which
specified that paper works in the north-eastern part of Jiangsu using straw as the raw
material should be closed. It will definitely reduce the risk of market and price
brought by straw demand of other industries.
3.2 Risk of power market
Policy assurance is provided. Renewable Energy Law in the People's Republic of
China was approved by the State Council on February 28, 2005 and enacted on
January 1, 2006. It is definitely specified in the above law that 100% power generated
from straw would be integrated and purchased to the grid.
13



Chapter 4 Fire Protection, Labor Security and Industrial Hygiene
4.1 Fire protection
The hidden danger of straw power plant is the flammability of straw. Therefore,
the project company has paid more attention to the fire risk of the straw storehouse
(nearly 3800m 2; capacity: about 1600t) inside the plant and five straw purchase
stations outside the plant.
(1) The new site is close to local fire protection department, only about 3km
away, which could provide reliable protection from fire for the plant. The straw
storage house (about 3800m2) inside the plant and the central straw collection station
(5265m2) are within the area protected by local fire protection department. Special fire
protection pumps will be placed in other four straw collection stations.
(2) In order to avoid fire accident as far as possible, the power plant shall have
special technicians for fire protection and shall intensively conduct propaganda and
education for fire protection.
(3) Fire protection system shall be designed closely following the relevant
standards and regulations and be equipped with complete facilities ( see Chapter 5
Fire protection of the power plant and Chapter 6 Fire Protection and Explosion Proof
in the Original Report)
(4) Prepare emergency plan. An emergency center with relevant employees and
equipment is to be established. Training plan of the emergency employees is included
in the Emergency Plan described in the Environmental Impact Assessment. The
Original Report does not include the cost of emergency equipment and training of
emergency employees while the supplement includes the above cost.
4.2 Measures for labor security and industrial hygiene
Measures for labor security and industrial hygiene are the same as those
described in the Original Report.
14



Chapter 5 Social effect and environment impact assessment
5.1 Social effect
The project will play a significant role in local economic development, energy
saving and power supply after its normal operation. The project also could increase
the GDP, expand social employment, raise income and improve people's living
conditions. Moreover, the plant may not only remove the environmental pollution
produced by the brick kiln factory, but also make good use of renewable energy and
reduce pollution brought by straw fire in the farmer's field. The project will have
good economic and social benefit. Originally a closed brick kiln factory, the new site
avoided the resettlement problem concerning 22 households (76 people) for the
original site and caused no essential adverse effect on the surroundings.
5.2 Conclusions on social impact
In conclusion, based on the new site, the project will have good economic and
social benefit. It is a project for energy saving and environmental protection, also a
project which could fully enjoy state preferable policies.
5.3 Environment Impact Assessment
(1) Atmospheric environment
Bag filter (high effective 99.9%) is used to clean the flue gas from the boiler.
Normal outlet dust concentration reaches 30g/Nm3. The bag of the filter has a service
life of more than three years. Some bags may be replaced without interrupting
normal operation of the boiler. Therefore, the dust concentration could meet the
standard. Compared to the original small brick kiln factory, the pollution is reduced
greatly.
(2) Water Environment
The industrial water supply system has been improved. All industrial water
could be recycled to use. Water consumption and drainage are reduced. Small quantity
15



of wastewater is conducted to Jiuyao River after treatment, which may not pollute the
river water.
(3) Acoustic environment
The power has mature noise protection measures which are described in the
Original Report. There is no modification to the noise protection measures.
The Original Report defines the environmental investment RMB23.68 million.
The Supplement includes RMB 1.371 million for the cost of management and
supervision of environment and implementation of relevant measures. Thus, the
revised environmental investment is RMB 25.051 million.

Chapter 8 Financial analysis and economic evaluation
8.1 Basis and principles
This report complies with Implement Methods & Documents of Economic
Assessment for Power Industry (1994) issued by Electric Power Industry Ministry , and
Methods and Parameters of Economic Appraisement of Constructions (version 2) issued by
State Planning Commission. The cost estimation is in accordance with Enterprise Financial
Regulations, Enterprise Accounting Regulations, and the related regulations of the local
area and the plant.
The financial appraisement and economic analysis of the project are done in the
condition of new project. During the calculation period, the cost and sale price are all
calculated as that of the base period. The calculation period of the financial appraisement is
22 years, the construction period is 2 years. In the third year of production, the production
load is 95%, which grows to 100% in the fourth year. By a comprehensive consideration of
the average cost of the project funds, the financial internal rate of return will be 7%. The
cost of project and income data include tax.
8.2 Financial appraisement
8.2.1 Sales income, sales tax and additional estimate
(I)The installed capability of the unit in this project is 25MW. The annual full-load
equivalent work time of the machine is 6975h. 10% of the power generated is consumed in
the plant. According to the document( FaGai Energy (2006) No.13) titled the Interim
Management Method for the Price and Cost Share of Power Generated from Renewable
Energy issued by National Development and Reform Commission(NDRC), the power
price will be set by the government. The price administrative department of the State
Council will formulate the standard price of the specific region. The power price consists
of two parts, one is the local standard price of electricity produced by coal fired unit with
sulfur removal device in 2005, the other is the subsidy amount to RMB 0.25/kwh.
According to the document ( FaGai Energy (2005) No.665) titled Notice on Price
23



Adjustment of Electricity Network in the East of China issued by NDRC, the price of
electricity produced by newly operated coal fired unit (including the heat-power unit) in
the area of East China is defined as follows: RMB 0.371/kwh for the units without sulfur
removal devices in Jiangsu, RMB 0.01 5/kwh addition for those units with sulfur removal
devices. The normal annual sales income of the project will be RMB 99.8123 million,
including the value added tax.
(2) According to Interim Regulations on Value Added Tax in PRC, No. 134 issued
by State Council, the tax rate of the sales is 17%, while that of the purchased materials and
fuel is to be credited. 13% for fuels and 17% for others. The normal annual value added tax
should be RMB 8.6906 million.
(3) According to local favoured policy,  the project is free of city construction &
maintenance tax and extra charges in education.
The annual value added tax and extra charges normally add up to RMB8.6906 million.
See the details of sales income and sales tax estimate in Supporting Statemment 4.
8.2.2 Estimate of the total cost
The estimate of the total cost in this project is made up of the following parts: the cost
of materials and fuel, power cost, wages and welfare costs, depreciation and amortization
cost, repair cost and other management costs.
(1) The data of the purchased materials and fuel and power is calculated according to
the data of the equipment, and the price is in accordance with the present domestic price
and the tendency. Therefore we calculate the price of straw to be RMB 258.75 /ton, water
RMB 4/MWh, average material cost RMB8.5/MWh, and other expenses RMB14/ MWh.
(2) Depreciation
The depreciation of fixed assets adopts the method of group-based straight-line
depreciation according to related national regulations. The production facilities are
depreciated from 15 years by the residual value rate of 5%. The intangible assets
and deferred assets are amortized in 10 years.
(3) The project company employs 80 staff, among them 50 regular employees
and 30 temporary workers. In the condition that the annual wage and welfare for
regular wokers is RMB 40, 000 per capita,and RMB12, 000 for temperary staff. The
total amount of the wage and welfare is RMB 2.36 million every year.
(4) The overhaul cost is calculated at the percentage of 3% of the fixed assets.
(5) Other management cost is calculated equal to 80% of total wage of the
employees, including management cost and various insurances.
(6) The financial expense is the interest of long-tern loan and circulating fund loan
in production period. The interest of the long-term loan in production period is calculated
24



according to the original loan sum in the loan period. The interest of the circulating fund
loan is calculated on the estimated actual sum of the loan.
The annual total cost of normal production is RMB58.8735 million.
8.2.3 Financial Appraisement
According to the income sheet, the annual total profit of the project is RMB32.2481
million normally. According to Interim Regulations on Value Added Tax, No.137 issued by
State Council, the income tax rate is 33%. Public welfare fund of the enterprises
established according to the Enterprise Law is not drawn since January 1, 2006. The profit
after income taxation can be distributed as dividend except for 10% of surplus reserve. See
the analysis of financial appraisement in Table8-1.

After calculation, the FIRR of the total investment is 8.14% after income tax, and
9.78% before income tax, which are both higher than the benchmark 7% rate of return. The
financial net present value after income tax is RMB 24.3558 million. The payoff period of
the investment after income tax is 11.19 year at the interest rate of 1.03. The project is
acceptable financially.
8.2.4 Solvency analysis
It's estimated that the ratio of debts to assets in the third year is 64.75%, which is
growing lower year by year. In the fifth year after startup, the ratio of debts to assets is
57.43%. Tthe company will have good reimbursement of current liabilities.The financial
status is quite good.

8.4 Risk analysis
8,4,1 Analysis on main risk factors
(1) Power price
As a special product, the price of the power is confirmed by related administrations.
The network electricity price of the plant in this project is to be confirmed by related local
administrations, and the result will directly affect the benefit of this project.
(2) Raw material
As a specific kind of fuel, the purchase area affects the economical efficiency of the
straw. Through a survey done in the circle of 25km radius in Rudong, the production
quantity and commercial quantity of straw is separately 111 OOOOt and 71 0000t. The supply
can meet the demand of the power plant.
The price of coal has increased significantly with the growth of the price of energy in
the world since 2003. The following figure provided by State Statistic Bureau shows the
ex-work price index of coal and washed coal products.

Price index of coal and washed coal products in China
Since they are all fuels, the price of coal will directly influence the expected price of
straw of local peasants. Meanwhile, the multi-use of straw, such as marsh gas, returning
straw into field, plough cover, etc. will probably affect the supply of straw.
(3) Project investment
In the construction period, the possible price inflation of the materials, equipments
and so on will require more investments. Since Chinese economy is developing quickly
these years, and the annual growth rate is even over 7%. The overheated economic
development causes the prices of products in investment go up continuously. During June
2004, the factory price of industrial products surpassed that of the same period of last year
by 3.5%. However, along with the measure of macro-control by the government, it's
hopeful that the price will turn steady. Besides, during the construction, there might be
some adjustment in technological design and construction in an allowed range, and some
other invisible elements, which will all bring some effect on the investment.

(4) The crisis of implement
If the fund cannot get ready in time, or some mistakes occurs in the management,
which causes delay in construction implement, the investment will also be delayed to
30



produce benefit.
(5) Technology crisis
Presently, there have been successful examples of 25MW straw power plant running
for many years abroad, and the technology of combining direct burning with gasification is
quite mature there. However, in China, there is no successful example of straw power
generation, especially industrialized ones, so there are crisis in technology. Meanwhile, any
mistake in the design and construction during the construction period may causes lost, even
affect the normal running after startup.
8.4.2 Risk policies
( 1 ) In China, price of most coal products has been market regulated except for that
of electricity produced by coal. The significant growth of coal price directly increased the
production cost of power plant. Therefore, NDRC issued a file titled Notice on
Readjustment of Power Price on December 21, 2003 and raised the power price twice in
2005 and 2006 respectively.
Biomass energy is one of the renewable energies which is encouraged in China
Renewable Energy Law to develop. The country have formulated series of favorable
policies which specify that the electricity produced by biomass energy is mandatory
integrated into and purchased by the power grid and there are price subsidy for biomass
power. The power price of the biomass power project is confirmed by the government and
includes two parts, one is the standard price for electricity generated from coal fired unit
with sulfur removal device, and the other is the subsidy price, i.e. RMB 0.25/kwh.
Additionally, Jiangsu Price Bureau formulated price favoured policies for renewable
energy power projects according the state policies on encouraging development of
renewable energy. Therefore, the risk of power price of the project is lower.
(2) In order to guarantee a sufficient supply of straw, the project company should
pay more attention to the management of straw purchase, sign a long-term purchase
agreement with the local peasants, especially those planting a large area, and try to reduce
the cost in purchase process.
(3) As to the crisis in construction implement, we are adopting the following
measures.
(0 Carry out more research and investigation before hand, comparing different
schemes to make a best choice.
) Calculate the unpredictable charge of the products and price according to the rate
31



offered by World Bank, ensuring the construction can be carried out as projectd.
Meanwhile, the documents required by World Bank should get ready for World Bank to
evaluate in time.
®   Arrange the funds of the project in a good order, thus to make sure that the funds
can be ready when in demand.
(1) Carry out the management task well, and allocated proper technicians to certain
construction implement tasks, ensuring a fluent construction.
8.5 Sensitivity analysis
Among all the sensitive elements, the one affects the financial internal rate of return
to total investment (before income tax) to the most is the network electricity price, and next
is the operation cost of the product, and the least is the change of investment in fixed assets.
See the details in Table 8-4.

In the preliminary scheme, the variance ratio of the project income, fixed assets
investment and project cost is separately -2.63%, 9.61% and 3.75%.
The effect of possible crisis on financial efficiency index is analyzed in the following
five conditions:
(1)The return of the project is affected by the market crisis and policy crisis: the
income of the project is reduced by 10%.
(2) Investment: given the condition that the investment is increased by 10%.
(3) Investment and raw material: given the condition that the investment is increased
by 10% and the raw material as straw is increased by 10%.
(4) Because of the insufficiency in management, technology and raw material supply,
the work time of the machine set is reduced by 10%, that is 6277.5h/year.
32



(5) The construction period of the project is prolonged by 1 year.
See the analysis of financial efficiency crisis in Table 8-5.

6        Prolonged period     1 year     9.03%              4836.81
From the table above, we can find that if any of the above types of risk coming, , the
financial internal rate of return is higher than 7% of the benchmark discount rate. Thus the
project enjoys a certain ability of overcoming crisis.

Chapter 9 Conclusions
9.1 Policy influence and environmental impact
9.1.1 The site change of the straw power plant from Mabei village, Matang Town to the
site of obsoleted Mingxin Construction Material Company accords with the industry policy
and land policy
9.1.2 The project location accords with the local general planning.
9.1.3 Plant land acquisition involves no resettlement
Without involving house rehabilitation and resettlement, the new site avoided all the
disputes and difficulties and the resettlement problem concerning 22 household (76 people)
for the original site.
9.1.4 After the completion of the project, there is a little influence on the ambience, and the
local environmental function will not be changed. With the strict prevention and control
measures and reinforced management, all contaminations will satisfy the standards of
discharge.
9.2 Influence on investment after site change
9.2.1 Relative total investment is reduced.
(1) The investment estimation of Project Appraisal Document is USD 36.08 million.
Based on the exchange rate 1: 8.2767 set in the Original Report, total investment is RMB
298.6233 million. It does not include the estimated construction cost RMB12.9289 million
for five straw purchase stations and land cost RMB 14.84 million for the plant site and five
straw purchase stations. If the above costs were covered, total investment based on the
original site would reach RMB326.3922 million.
(2) The total investment estimation RMB 291.8278 million based on the new site
includes the construction cost of five straw purchase stations and land costs of the plant
site and five straw purchase stations.
(3) The total investment based on the new site is reduced by RMB 34.566 million.
34



9.3 Change of estimated economic benefit
The project benefit estimated in the Supplement is slightly reduced due to the
following reasons. But the Financial internal rate of return (FIRR) based on total
investment is 8.14 %( after income tax) and 9.78% (before income tax), both of the rate are
higher than the benchmark rate of return.
(1) Annual sales income is reduced.
According to the comments of Consultant hired by the World Bank, the annual
full-load equivalent hour of boiler is reduced from 7200 to 6975. Therefore, the electricity
integrated into the grid is reduced from 162 x106 kwh GWh to 157 x106 kwh.
(2) The loan interest is raised.
After site change, the total amount of the World Bank loan is unchanged, but the
interest is increased. The annual interest rate indicated in the Original Report is 2.800%
which equal to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on January 1, 2004 for
six-month deposits in Dollars plus the fixed spread. The annual commitment charge is
0.75%. In the Supplement, the annual interest of the World Bank loan is estimated on the
basis of 4.43% which equal to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on March 15,
2005 for six-month deposits in Dollars plus LIBOR Total Spread. The commitment charge
remains 0.75% per year. For long-term loan from domestic banks, the amount is slightly
higher than that determined in the original report, i.e. from RMB37 million to RMB 37.75
million and the interest rate is raised from 5.98% to 6.12%
9.4 Economic index of the project
Static investment               RMB 268.268 million (including grid
integration system)
Unit consturction cost          RMB 10730.72 /KW
Annual power generation          174 X 1 06 kwh/a
Annual power supplied to the grid  157x 106 kwh/a
Covering  area                  92mu
Annual straw consumed            15.345 X 104 t/a
Power consumed by the plant     10%
Eorkforce                       50 regular workers + 30 temporary workers
Unit cost                       RMB 337.63 / MW
35



Power price (tax included)      RMB 636 / MW
Internal rate of return (after tax)  8.14%
Profit rate to investment        10.95%
Net profit rate to capital assets  22.49%
In summary, based on the new site, the project enjoys favorable social benefit and
good economic benefit with reduced investment , little resettlement influence and no
additional environment impact.
