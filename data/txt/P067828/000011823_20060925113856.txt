The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1   Background of the Project
Nowadays, governments and scientists of the whole world pay more attention to the technical
development and application of the biomass energy. Our government has also attached importance
to it. As an important strategy, the development of renewable energy has been placed on the 21st
Century Agenda of China.
Rudong lies in Jiangsu Plain that has rich resources of straw. Rudong has a farmland of
1,580,000 mu with an annual yield of over 900,000 tons of crops, and the yield of straw is
1,237,000 tons within a radius of 25 kmn, the straw has high density as well as merchandizing rate,
so this place is a perfect location for establishing a straw power plant project. The 25MW Straw
power plant Project that plans to obtain World Bank loan is an important component of
establishing a new energy base in Rudong. And Jiangsu Guoxin New Energy Development
Company Ltd. takes charge of the relevant works. The total installed capacity of the project is
25MW and estimated annual yield is 180 million kWh, of which 162 million kWh will be
conveyed to the grid annually.
According to the national goal of the development and application of renewable energy, the
mature technology and equipments of straw power has been introduced through international
cooperation in order to realize the commercialization of straw power. Nearly four years of
preliminary work and relevant works such as technology review, project site selection,
introduction of technology, etc. have already completed. As a spare project of Eleventh Five-Year
Plan of Jiangsu Province, it has been investigated and approved by the Energy Institute of
National Development and Reform Commission as a national demonstration project.
1.2   The straw burning and utilization situation
China is a big agricultural country with straw yield one billion ton every year. In the past, the
huge resources were returned to farmland directly or indirectly and can maintain the ecological
balance, increase the production. In recent years, the way of using straw to produce fertilizer and
returning to farmland is decreasing, but straw burning is getting worse. It not only waste resource,
but also pollute environment, block transportation.
Destroy the soil system directly, and result in the decrease if organic substance .So we should



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
forbid straw burning and advocate the synthetic utilization.
* Impact on Air quality
The straw burning can endanger, serious air pollution and discharge a great deal of C02,
NOx and dust.. If we dot not control the concentrating straw burning, it will aggravate the air
quality of china.
* Impact on Human's Health
Dust from rice straw combustion is harmful to human's health. Rice straw contains high level
of silica. The emitted gas from rice straw firing contains 72.11% SiO2. If the SiO2 is directly
emitted into the air, it is harmful to human's health.
*   Impact on quality
The straw burning can block transportation .It can result in heavy smog and blacken the sky
and affect the normal take-off and landing of airplane when burning even can induce the traffic
accident.
*    Impact on soil
The content of organic substances and microorganism can reflect the quality of soil. With the
development of standard living, the straw has become wasteful. It is not favorable to the
agricultural sustain development.
1.3   The necessity of the proposed project
The biomass is an important energy and is only inferior to coal, oil, natural gas. At present the
exploitation of biomass in china is transiting from trial phase to commercial exploitation on large
scale. The biomass has become the latest resource that has the great exploitative scale.
In conclusion, the proposed project accord with energy development strategy of china and is the
beneficial supplementary of energy consumption in Jiangsu. Furthermore, the area has the
beneficial and advantageous sources and the environmental benefit is evident. So it is important to
exploit the biomass resource in this area.
1.4   Progress of Environmental Impact Assessment
The original project site is Mabei Village, Matang Town, Rudong, Jiangsu. The New Energy
Office of Rudong County, Jiangsu Province took charge of the preparatory work of the project.
Jiangsu Guoxin New Energy Development Company Ltd, the project company took over the
2



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
implementation of the project in January 2006.
The New Energy Office of Rudong County, Jiangsu Province has entrusted   the
environmental impact assessment work of the project ( 25MW ) to Nanjing Lark World
Environment Technology Project Co., Ltd. in Nov. 2003. With the assistance of local government,
the assessment team has organized on-the-spot investigation twice separately in Nov. and Dec.
2003 according to Feasibility Report and project proposal. The team investigated the environment
condition and protected targets of the project, and also visited relevant departments, at the same
time, the team organized various public surveys among the people and companies concerned, and
then they carried out environmental monitoring work. After enduring works, the assessment team
put forward environment protection measures, estimated environment protection cost,
environment management plan, ways of public participation and information publication, and
finally in June 2004, the environment impact assessment and environment management plan are
accomplished.
The site was moved to Yinxing Village (formerly Yinbei Village), Juegang Town from Mabei
Village Matang Town at the beginning of 2005. Site change reason is as follows:
(I) To keep away from the agricultural land, especially farmland as far as possible, and
not affect the project construction progress;
(M)Because the national land protective policy is compelled for implementation, and more land is
occupied by the original scheme, it is hard to get the approval from the state.
(2) Because the Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd. is a clay brick mill, by the
relative rules of document (No.2002-42) of Jiangsu Province People's Government, it
stipulates that simple kiln under 18 portals for illegally earth excavation existing safety risk
with lagged technology shall be closed. Juegang Town People's Government closed the mill in
Nov. 2004, so that 92mu land inside the mill become as idle land. At the same time, Juegang
Town People's Government invited the project owner - Jiangsu Provincial Guoxin Asset
Management Group ltd. to submit to Jiangsu Province National Land Recourse Department to
transfer 92mu land for the project use.
(3) During the period of the national land protective policy, the land policy is compelled
for implementation, and more land be occupied by the original scheme, it is hard to get the
approval from the state. But the new site is on the idle land in Mingxing brick mill, not use
3



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
farmland and easy for land use application.
(II) To reduce resettlement impact
There is not resident living in the idle land, therefore there is not house relocation
problem; at the same time, the project uses idle land without land acquisition for farmland, so
that it will not be concerned with resettlement problem.
(III) Other favorable factors
(1) Located near No.223 provincial road, transportation of new site is convenient;
(2) It is surrounded by waters on three sides. This can guarantee the water supply for the
power station operation;
(3) The project site is close to the fire department, only 3km away, so that the safe
operation of the power station can be rather highly guaranteed.
(4) The project constructed in the new site could save the costs of house rehabilitation,
resettlement and compensation, therefore to reduce the project investment.
In January 2006, the project company entrusted the revision work of environmental impact
assessment to Nanjing Lark World Environment Technology Project Co., Ltd. The environmental
impact assessment was revised again in April 2006, finally in July 2006; the environmental impact
assessment for the changed site was accomplished.
The proposal that suggests the straw as fuel is a recycling energy project, but the
construction work of the project may includes confiscating lands, rezoning the district and
relocation of population, so the project is classified as a B class construction project.
The assessment team ensures that Chinese and English version of all documents are
coherent. Because of the differences between Chinese and English, the expression may be
different but there is no essential difference.
1.5   Assessment Goal
By investigating, monitoring and analyzing the natural environment, social environment
and present environmental quality in the assessment range of the proposed project, various
impacts brought by the project have been analyzed and forecasted qualitatively or quantitatively,
and corresponding environment management plan have been prepared, to reach the following
goals:
*   To ensure the feasibility of proposed project on the aspect of environment protection;

The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
Chapter2 Project Survey
2.1 Geographical Location Geological Condition of the Project
Juegang Town, situated in the southeast of Jiangsu Province and at the meeting point of
Yangtze River and the development belt, is the big industrial and agricultural town of the Yangtze
River delta and one of the 100 noted towns of Jiangsu Province.
Juegang Town has peculiar geographical environment and favorable weather conditions.
Surrounded by the sea on all sides, it has the typical maritime climate. It has four distinct seasons,
ample rainfall and sufficient sunshine. It is mild and humid, and has a long frostless period. All of
these ensure that there are abundant agriculture by-product resources and sea product resources.
The proposed location of the plant is flat, and the height of the land is about 4m, and it is
geologically situated at Tongchen massif, far away from the boundary of massif. Its structure is
basically stable. The average earthquake magnitude is VII grade. The foundation of the location is
consisted of powder clay, powder earth, powder and fine sand.
2.2 The Scale of the Proposed Project
The proposed project (25MW) is consisted of warehouse, boiler house, turbine house etc,
with an area of 92 mu and the total investment of RMB 291.82 million. The electric power
production capacity is 25MW. The working hour is 6975 hours per year. The consumption of straw
is 153,450 tons annually. The annual electric power production is 174 million kWh, of which
157 million kWh will be conveyed to the grid annually. Factory can provide jobs for 80
employees.
2.3 Service Functions of the Proposed Project
In 2003, the total consumption of electric power of Rudong County is 698 million kWh, the
maximum capacity reaches 130MW, and the consumption of electric power of Rudong County is
830 million kWh in 2005, the maximum capacity will be 183MW. After the completion of Rudong
straw power plant it can offer clean energy for economy development of this area and become
available complement of power supply for Jiangsu Province Electricity Net.
2.4 Status of Power Supply in Rudong
The electricity net of Rudong is at the end of Jiangsu Electricity Net. Its main power
supplier is Jiangsu Electricity Net. At present there is one transformer substation of 220KV, six
12



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
transformer substations of 110KV and ten transformer substations of 35KV in the whole county,
which composed the electricity-providing net. The circuit of 220KV (from Liu-Bridge to Juegang
Town) supplies most charge of the whole county.
The distribution of electricity in Rudong County is that: on one side the charge is relatively
centralized because the industries are centralized in center town; on the other side the charge of
electricity used by agriculture and aquaculture is low in density and relatively dispersed.
2.5 Project Overview
2.5.1 Project Coverage Brief and the Plane Layout of the Plant Area
The total area of the plant is 92 mu. The occupied area of the construction is within the
occupied area of the electricity plant.
The straw warehouse located on the south west side of Jiuyao River. The size is 54 X
67.2m.
The technique procedure requires the boiler house to be near the straw warehouse, and the
center of the warehouse to be close to the central line of boiler, so the stuff can be transferred to
boiler directly.
To the southern and northern side of the power plant is residential area, and there is a
provincial road in the east, so the chimney is better build in the north to the center. Facing
East-North-East (ENE), the power plant has Yaohe River on the back. There is no resident in
West-South-West (WSW) area. The chimney is situated in the north to the center. Main wind
direction is ENE. The gas from the chimney has no impact on the nearby residents and on the
plant area environment. The turbine house is better build in south, thus can meet the requirements
of turbines for aeration and lighting.
The location of the cooling tower should avoid the influence of winter wind to the main
factory buildings, and be near the turbine house, thus can eliminate the length of pipes of
circulating water. The cooling tower will be located on the north-east corner of the factory area.
The cooling tower situates more than 300m away from the road in the east. There is no passage
2
way for people and material nearby the cooling tower. With a water drenching area of 1250m
the cooling tower is made from reinforced concrete and is hyperbola natural-aeration
with reverse flow. Tower height: 54m; air inlet height: 3.5m; radius at Om: 22.06m;
inverted T-type base. Cycling water quantity of the unit is 5900m3/h. The spray radius
13



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
of cooling tower plume will not be more than 50m in case of no wind and will not be
longer than 200 m in case of wind, so it will not fall onto a road during the winter
season. No accidents due to icing of the road and fog conditions that make driving
very dangerous will happen.
Office building, dinning hall and dormitory will center on the windward side, with the
convenience of entry from the eastern road to the factory in consideration.
Straw procurement station: the project company will build one central station and four key
stations. The central station is located near the main building, which uses 20.8 mu rented from
Yinxing Village by the project company. The project company is carrying out the land acquisition
procedures for the central station. The locations of other 4 stations are under planning and
selection.
2.5.2 Project Equipments
For the primary equipments and environment protection facilities of the power plant see the
table 2-5-1.
The local peasants or fodder middlemen can provide the straw needed by the project. The
straw that is collected and wrapped can be transmitted on land to plant warehouse. And then
through the suspending bridge the straw is placed on transmitting belt and then to boiler. The straw
has been smashed into pieces before it drops on the fine-toothed comb, which is at the

The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
end of the burning boiler. Straw will be burned and water around the boiler wall will be heated to
turn into steam and the temperature is up to 540W. After this there are also three continuous
processes:
(1) The steam passes through overheated settings and pushes the steam turbine to rotate.
The steam turbine is connected with electricity generating settings. It can produce 1OKV
electricity and then improve the voltage to 110 KV. Electricity will be transmitted by underground
cable to transformer stations and then to the network.
(2) The steam pressure and temperature are both decreased to some extent after having
passed through steam turbine. And then it will enter the condenser and be condensed by
circulating cooling water. The steam turns into water again after being cooled and flows into
closed water-circulating pipeline, which is circling boiler wall and then starts new circulation
again.
(3) When the straw is on burning, the unburned part and the burned ashes will deposit at the
bottom of the boiler, and the smog will enter the bag-house filter chambers. At this time smog has
been filtered and cleaned, and then it will be let out through chimney.
(4) The ashes from the boiler and filter will go through the pump transmitting system and
be transported into the ash house, then be transported to farmland by hermetic vehicles.

2.5.3 Fuels and Element Analysis
There is abundant straw resource in this area. The production is 1,237 thousand tons within a
25 kilometers radius. The quantity of straw that can be merchandised is 760 thousand tons.
Density of straw resource is high and climate has little impact on straw production, so straw can
completely meet the fuel need of the project. Straw is to be transported by land. Analysis result of
straw composition of the project can be seen in table 2-5-2. In the preliminary work, the four kinds
of stalk (such as rice stalk, wheat stalk, cotton stalk and cornstalk) have been sent to authorities for
test. The proposed operating time per year is 6975 hours and straw wastage is 153.45 thousand
tons.

2.5.4 Warehouse
In order to ensure the abundance, reliability, stability and security of straw, the project
company will build one central station and four key stations. The central station is located near
the main building. Locations of other 4 stations are under planning and selection.
2.5.5 Water
There are two resources of water supply for the power plant. Daily water and chemical
water will be supplied by tap water; circulating supplement water used in production process is
from Jiuyao River. The water fetching mouth is set in east bank of Jiuyao River, which is situated

2.5.6 Composition and Disposal of Ash
Perhaps there is a little heavy metal in ash, so we made a composition analysis of ash. The
result can be seen in 2-5-5. It can be seen that the quantity of heavy metal is very tiny and can
meet the requirement the Standard Value of Pollutant in Farming Powder. There is no soil
accumulation effect and harm on people.
The unbumed straw and the ash of bumed straw can return to farm fields, which can be
added to soil as fertilizer and improve soil quality without pollution.

2.6 Main Pollutants
2.6.1 Air pollutant
According to the utilization aim of renewable energy in China, the proposed project will
introduce the mature technique and equipments of straw power into China, realizing the
commercialization and mass production of straw power. As biomass energy, the straw is renewable
energy and harmless. Furthermore, straw is a low carbon fuiel which content of sulfur and ash is
lower than the coal that was used widely, so it is a "clean" fuel. With the effective measures, the
gas produced by combustion pass through a bag-house filter before emission to the atmosphere, so
the concentration of pollutant accord with the E period standard in Emission Standard of Air
Pollutants for Thermal Power Plants (GB13223-2003)(air excess coefficient a is 1.4): S02<
400mg/m3: NOx<450 mg/in3; PM,,<50mg/m3.

Inevitably, this project will affect the natural environment, ecological environment and
social environment during the constructing and operating period. Except for the Jiuyao River
which is liable to be affected, there are no other sensitive places such as nature reserves, scenic
spots, cultural relics and protection units of historical relics etc. This report is mainly concerned
with the environmental impacts during the constructing period, the impacts and risks to the air
during the operating period as well as some alleviative measures to these disadvantageous
impacts and latent risks.
4.1 The ecological impact analysis and measures.
Because the main ecosystem in the project site is the croplands, the basic principle of this
assessment of the impacts to the ecological environment is to reveal the impacts and see if the
impacts are beyond the ecological load of the project site and if they will have great impacts to
the integrity of the ecological environment according to the main function of the ecological
environment, i.e. the agricultural production.
4.1.1 The dust of construction period
Digging work will destroy the structure of soil and earth's plant, produce dust .A quantity of
dust not only harm the air quality, but also the respiration and grousing of surrounded plants
there is no sensitive target, around, and it is adjacent to road, farmland, so the environmental
impact is very little.
The concrete prevention measures as follows.
The measures for water and soil conservation as follows:
*   The piling points of the abandoned soil must be arranged in the range of occupied land;
it is not permitted to use the farmland, irrigating facility and area near the river. The
abandoned soil must be pressed tightly in time;
*   During digging the groundwork, at the soil taking and abandoned place, certain quantity
of protecting goods such as oilcloth would be prepared to cover the soil for preventing
soil erosion in the rainy day;
*   The construction team should contact with the weather bureau, at any moment. In order
to adopt necessary temporary measures. It should maintain the straightway of drainage
30



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
system;
*   Choose the locations of temporary engineering such as the spots for building material
piling in constructing area should be rationally; arrange them in the range of the
occupied land; after construction, clean and level up the temporary land and plant trees.
4.1.2 Influence on Agriculture Production and Mitigation Measures
There is 100 mu land is needed during the construction of the project. The reduced land in
all the teams will be compensated in cash.
4.1.3 The Analysis on the Influence of Famous Trees and Mitigation Measures
According to the site investigation, in the range of the project there are no old and famous
trees.
4.2 Analysis and Alleviative measures to the impacts to the air
The dust produced by the transporting vehicles during the constructing period and the air
pollutants of the straw burning emitted from the boiler during the operating period causes the
main air pollution in this project.
4.2.1 Constructing Period
During the constructing progress, the main air pollutants are:
(1) Exhaust gas
During the constructing period, the exhaust gas mainly comes from the constructing
machines and transporting vehicles, containing the pollutants such as N02, CO and hydrocarbon
etc. In addition, other exhaust gases come from fuel burning by the constructing people in daily
life.
(2) Dust and powder
During the constructing period, the main powder pollutants include:
The dust produced by the building materials such as cement, lime and sand when they are
blown during load, unload, transporting and piling;
The dust on the ground produced by the transporting vehicles;
The dust produced by the constructing garbage when they are piled and cleaned up.
31



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
The dust and powder mentioned above will cause the air pollution of the surrounding
enviromnent. The powder pollution during the constructing period is decided by the operating
mode. The dust pollution may be cause by the way of piling the materials and especially by the
wind blowing, and will bring some disadvantageous impacts to the air and the residents around
the site. During the operating period, the density of the suspending grains in the atmospheric
layer near the ground will be several folds or more than ten-fold of that of the usual time and will
be greatly beyond the StandardLiin Standard of the Air Quality(GB3095-1996). However, due
to the big diameter of the dust grains (usually more than 1OOtm), the dust flows on the ground
quickly and will only affect the area around the constructing site, which is fairly small.
During the constructing period, the earthwork, the load and unload, the transportation will
produce dust up into the air which will do harm to the air of the surroundings. Therefore, some
feasible controlling measures must be worked out to reduce the pollution or reduce the affected
areas. The main alleviative measures are listed as follows:
*   There should be a rational management of the constructing sites: piling the sand and
stone material together, storing the cement in a special storehouse, reducing
transporting steps, carrying the materials carefully to prevent destroying the packing
bags.
*   Some water should be sprayed on the operating surface to keep humid and reduce dust.
The constructing soil garbage must be moved in time to prevent causing flying dust
after being piled for a long time or being washed by the rain.
*   The transporting vehicles should be in good condition. There should be no overload
and some coverings and airtight facilities should be taken to reduce the dust flying out
during the transportation. The soil and building materials falling on the ground should
be cleaned in time. Wash the tire. Spray water regularly to reduce the dust in the
transportation.
*   The enclosure should be set up in the constructing sites to reduce the range of the
falling dust.
*   Water should be sprayed regularly on the ground in the constructing sites. Clean the
garbage in time to prevent causing flying dust and powder pollution. When the wind
32



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
speed is over 4.5m/s, constructing word should be stopped and the building material
such as the sand and powder should be covered.
4.2.2. Analysis of the Environmental accidents
According to the features of this project, the emission sources, which may cause the emission
accidents, are:
(1)   Malfunction of the hop-pocket dust catcher which causes the dust emission beyond
the standard;
(2)   Fire in the straw storehouse.
4.2.2.1. Analysis of Accidents Caused by the Hop-pocket Dust Catcher
Standard of the Emission Accidents
During the operating period, if the hop-pocket dust catcher cannot function properly and
its efficiency descends to 99%, a great number of pollutants will be emitted directing into the air.
In this case, the density of the emitted smoke and dust will be 300-1000mg /Nm3, which is
beyond the standard of GB13223-2003.
Analysis of the Impacts of the Emission Accidents
According to the predication, when the bag-house filter dust cannot function properly, the
density of the emitted smoke and dust will be 300mg/Nm3, which is beyond the standard of
emission density. Therefore, some effective measures must be taken to avoid the accidents.
Precautions against Accidents and Emergency Measures
Inspect regularly the hop-pocket dust catcher system and pneumatic dust remover system;
ensure that all the necessary accessories function properly.
Check regularly the successive monitoring system of the smoke and dust; find out the
causes as soon as possible when the smoke and dust is beyond the standard.
Reinforce the management; detect and remove the hidden trouble in time; establish and
strictly carry out all kinds of regulations and rules preventing accidents.
Heighten the personnel's consciousness of preventing accidents and strengthen the
emergency training after the accidents.
4.2.2.2. Analysis of Fire Accidents in Straw Storehouse
The rectangular straw storehouse with an area of about 3000 m2 has a storage capacity that
can ensure the boiler to work for 3 days. Central straw purchase station also has the
33



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
risk of fire. The straw is inflammable and is easy to catch fire at the slightest carelessness,
especially in the seasons of high temperature. Therefore, an emergency aid team should be set up
to reduce the disadvantageous impacts to the minimum. The straw storehouse is equipped with
good ventilation, drying and illumination conditions as well as fire protection equipment such as
fire alarming system, intelligent infrared detection equipment, spray fire extinction system and
automatic fire extinguisher. The vacuum clean device is used to clean the crushed straw and
straw dust to reduce the hidden fire risk and improve the safety of the storehouse.
Emergency plan
The emergency plan includes the responsibility and duty of the commanding institute and
relevant cooperation units, the alternatives of emergency techniques and settling modes, the
allocation and disposition of the equipments, the supply and restructure of manpower and
material resources, the dynamic monitoring system of accident, the information system after
accidents.
A. Establish the Emergency Network, the Emergency Leading Committee; Assign the
Emergency commanders
Leaded by the Nantong Environmental Protection Bureau, the Rudong county government
and other related units such as Rudong Environmental Protection Bureau, Rudong
Environmental Monitoring Station and Rudong Fire Brigade establish an emergency network and
an emergency leading commnittee. The emergency commanders are the personnel with special
trainings of the power plant. The Emergency Center is equipped with special emergency
telephone and duty personnel in charge of receiving calls all day long. Once there is an accident,
the commanders should be informed immediately. Then they should connect with the Emergency
Leading Committee according to the emergency plan and go into action.
B. Emergency Disposal
Once there is a fire in the straw storehouse, the management station should use the mobile
telephone to call the emergency center. The duty personnel of the emergency center should
inform the emergency commanders after sizing up the situation, and the commanders should
inform the personnel of the emergency disposal team. The disposal team should get to the spot
immediately and take emergency measures to prevent the diffusion of pollution and the
deterioration of the danger. If the neighbors are involved, they should be evacuated immediately.

4.2.3 Predication and Assessment of the Impacts to the Air during the Operating Period
During the operating period, the smoke causes the main air pollution during the straw
burning. The main pollutants in the smoke include soot and-SO2. The project site is situated in
the plain area, and the system wind is in dominance, which shows the common characters of the
wind field in the plain. Therefore, this assessment and predication mode adopts the
wind-diffusion mode and breeze-diffusion mode commended by Assessment Regulation of
Environmental Impacts in China (HJ/T2.2-93) to calculate the density of N02,PM10 on the
ground level of the site(including the hourly average density and daily average density).
According to the calculation in this mode, on the condition of atmospheric stability, the hour
density of NO2 on the largest spot is 80.16 ii gms/Nm3, which accounts for 33.4% of the standard
[standard: 240 pi gms/Nm3 hourly, 120 il gms/Nm3 daily and8O it gmsiNm3 annually, see Table
1-11-1 Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996 ) ]; the maximum daily density of NO2
and PMIo is    0.0058mg/m3and 0.0008 mg/m3    respectively , which accounts for 4.83%
and0.53%respectively[standard: 0.12 mg/m3and 0.15 mg/m3, see: Table 1-11-Ambient
Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996) ) . According to the statistics above, the environmental
impacts of the air pollutants in the project are limited. The detailed alleviative measures are listed
as follows:
*    Highly effective hop-pocket dust catcher will be put into use in the project. Its
efficiency is 99.9% and the smoke and dust emitted will reach the standard with it.
*   The impacts of the smoke and dust out of the lOOm-high chimney to the surrounding
environment will reach Standard D of Emission standard of Air Pollutants for Power
Plants (GB 13223-2003) and that of Ambient Air Quality Standard;
4.3 Assessment of Water Environmental Impacts and Alleviative Measures
During the constructing period, the water pollution is mainly caused by the life wastewater
produced by the constructing personnel. During the operating period, there is a small quantity of
producing and life wastewater. Some of the alleviative measures that would be adopted to reduce
the impacts are presented below:
36



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
4.3.1 Constructing Period
During the constructing period, it is inevitable that there will be slurry water after the
washing of equipments and the life wastewater of the constructing personnel. Although the
wastewater is not in large quantity, it could cause environmental pollution if it is not disposed or
not disposed properly. Therefore, the wastewater produced during the constructing period should
not be drained randomly. The main alleviative measures are as follows:
*   Reduce material losing, dispersing and overflowing; reduce the production of
wastewater;
*   Pile the building materials such as cement, yellow sand and lime together and take
some necessary rainproof measures; Clean the materials falling on the ground in
constructing progress to make them easily washed into the sewage treatment facilities;
*   Build the temporary lavatory with septic tank, and the wastes will be collected
regularly by local department of city environment and sanitation to designated places
for disposal;
During the constructing period, the main garbage is the building garbage and the life
garbage of the personnel.
The building garbage should be cleaned up and put into use in time to avoid causing flying
dust after being piled up for a long time. If the life garbage is not cleaned up and disposed in
time, it will rot, make mosquitoes and flies propagate, produce odor and spread diseases, which
will do harm to the surroundings and the health of the personnel.
4.3.2 Operating Period
After the project is put into production, the main wastewater includes circulation water,
sewage, acid and alkali wastewater, industrial wastewater and life wastewater etc. According to
the rule of "one water, many usages", the industrial water after being disposed will be used as
circulation supplying water, the sewage out of the boiler and the acid and alkali wastewater will
be drained into the Jiuyao River after being disposed and reaching the drain standard (see Table
4-2-3); the life wastewater will be used as the irrigating water of the greens in the factory after
the biochemical disposition.
Sewage of the power plant must reach the standard of Wastewater Discharge
Standard(GB8978 - 1996)before it is drained (See table 4-2-3). According to the
37



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
predication, the drain situation and the draining water quality are described in
figure4-2-3.

Detailed alleviative measures are as follows:
*   The condenser of steam turbine, dynamotor and oil cooler should adopt the cycle
mode of cooling water. The circulating draining sewage is harmless clean water and
will be used as industrial water after cooling.
*   The acid and alkali wastewater will be neutralized after being drained into the
neutralization pool, and will be drained into Jiuyao river when their pH is 6.5-8.5.
*   The industrial miscellaneous water will flow into the recycling pool after the
disposition and will be used as the complementary water for the circulating water.
*   The sewage out of the boiler will reach the National StandardDafter being cooled in
the cooling pool and will be drained into Jiuyao River.
*  The life sewage will reach the National Standard Lafter the grade-2 biochemical
disposition and will be used to remove the dust and green the factory. (See section

4.4 Analysis of Noise Impacts and Alleviative Measures
4.4.1 Constructing Period
During the constructing progress, the operation of all kinds of constructing machines and
the moving of all kinds of vehicles will cause noise pollution inevitably. The noise of the
constructing machines is high. In the construction, all the machines always work at the same
time and the radiant sound powers of all kinds of noise sources are strengthened by each other,
which will make the noise lever higher and radiating area larger.
The calculation formula of a single noise source is as follows:
r0
L = Lo - 20 Ig -
L in the formula is the noise level of the place r away from the noise source,
dB(A).
The adding of the impacts of two noise sources on the same point is calculated in
the following formula:
LI    L2
L1+2 =1 Olg[1010 + 10 10]
According the calculation, when the noise level of the constructing equipment is 120dB
(A), the impact degree of the spot in the distance of 500meter is 66.0dB (A); when the noise
level of the constructing equipment is 115dB (A), the impact degree of that spot is 61.0dB (A);
when the noise level of the constructing equipment is 1 OdB (A), the impact degree of the spot is
51.OdB (A). In allusion to the situation above, the following measures can be taken to reduce the
noise impact t to the surroundings in the constructing period:
Intensify the constructing management; forbid the operation with high noise at night;
*   Place the fixed constructing machines at the location where the minimum impact is
caused to the surroundings;
*   When the continuous pouring operation of concrete is necessary, al the preparations
should be made before the operation to reduce the operating time of the mixer.
Besides the noises generated by the machines mentioned above, the running of all sorts of
transporting vehicles during the constructing period would increase the noise level at the
39



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
sensitive point. Therefore, the management of transporting vehicles should be reinforced: the
whistle by the vehicles should be in control; the vehicles should be dispatched properly to reduce
the quantity of the vehicles and running density in the constructing area.
4.4.2 Operating Period
The main noise sources in this project are in the main workshop and blower room. The
equipments with high noise are steam turbine, dynamotor, exciter, coagulating water pump,
shooting water pump, electronic feed water pump, blower and drawing blower etc. The noise of
the main equipments in the project sees the table 4-4-1.

By calculating and forecasting, the noise lever could reach the standard L] in the Standard
of Noise at Boundary of Industrial Enterprises (GB 12348-90).

The main job of this forecast is to calculate the impacts of the main noise sources on the
monitoring points on the border of the factory and get the adding results of the predicted impacts
40



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
that will be added to the status monitoring results to predict the noise impacts to the border of the
factory. With the formula recommended by Technical Regulations of the Environmental Impact
Assessment of P.R.C., the calculating results are shown in the figure 4-4-2. The impacts of the
main noise sources in the factory on the status monitoring points can reach the requirements of
type-Istandard of Noise Standard on the Border of the Factory or Enterprise (GB 12348-90).
In this project some alleviative measures are taken as follows:
*   Install double- layer noise insulating windows and doors in the control room of the
machines and the boiler and main control room. Equip the indoor ceilings with the
noise absorbing material.
*   Install noise insulating layer and heat preserving layer on the boiler and drawing
blower.
*   Install the muffle on the exhaust pipe to the air of the boiler.
*   Present the requirements of limiting the noise of all the equipments that may be the
noise sources when they are ordered.
*   In the design of the whole layout of the plant, the buildings causing great noise should
be settled in the center of the plant area and be away from the plant border to reduce
the industrial noise impact of the power plant on the surrounding environment.
*   Enhance the greening program in the plant area to beautify the environment, insulate
noise and remove dust.
4.5 Analysis of the Impacts of Land Requisition and Alleviative Measures (reason of site
change is described in detailed in section 1.4)
The proposed site situates in the brick factory of Mingxing Construction Materials
Company which has been closed and the land there belongs to the idle construction land
without involving resettlement and rehabilitation and compensation. Compared with the original
site, the new site enjoys a number advantage. Moreover, it is a subproject of CRESP. In order to
ensure the scheduled process of the project, no alternatives, including alternative sites,
alternatives fuels and alternative power generation schemes, had been considered. The change
of the site meets the national industry policy and is a reasonable allocation of land which can
optimizes the land resources.

The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
4.6 The Analysis of the Social Impacts and Alleviative Measures
This project will bring some social influence; the positive aspect is as follows:
*   This project affords a new way to develop the large-scale utilization of straw resources
of our country;
*   This project is an important supplement to the energy of Jiangsu province, which can
promote the social economic development and improve people's living standard;
*   The project of generating electricity with straw in some degree can take the place of the
coal power plant. Effective utilization of straw is a proper measure to improve the life
standard of the farmers;
*   The fuel of this project is renewable and therefore is harmless to the surrounding
environment.
On the other hand, the project may affect the social environment in the following aspects:
The land expropriation and resettlement will affect the people's life. During the
constructing period, the present traffic would be influenced and there would be more jam
phenomenon. The construction may affect the irrigating facility in the farmland; in addition,
wastewater, dust and noise may impact on the surrounding environment. With the following
measures, these impacts could be alleviated.
*   Before construction, the constructing border should be regulated to ensure that the
construction is within the range of expropriated lands. Working outside the border
would be prohibited and it wouldn't be permitted to do damage to the vegetation and
buildings beyond the border. Once this happens, local government will rationally
compensate for the affected people;
*   During construction period, the construction unit must enhance the protection of the
irrigating facility in farmland, and ensure that the facility runs smoothly. It would be
forbidden to pile the constructing materials into the agricultural drainage channel , and
to dump the waste soil and stone into the irrigation and drainage channel;
*   The smoke cleaning equipment should be checked periodically and the maintenance of
the purifying equipment should be enhanced in the daily operation.
4.7 Construction Management
According to the arrangement of the construction, most of the constructing personnel will
42



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
be accommodated temporarily in the local private houses. In the building site, we will set up 3 or
4 accommodation spots where the temporary lavatory with septic tank should be built to dispose
the life wastewater. The wastes will be collected regularly by local department of city
environment and sanitation to the designated places for disposal. The life garbage should be
stored together and cleaned by the public sanitation department periodically. In addition, the
drinking water should accord with the healthy standard.
A public bidding will be hold to choose the contractor of this project, who should have
abundant construction experience and will establish every kind of regulations under the owner's
supervision. All the personnel should be trained and the training includes environmental
management, daily constructing safety, noise management, dust management, accommodation
areas management and occupational health education. In addition, environmental management
and measures will be included in the contract of the contractor. Besides the owner, the
environmental personnel, including the environment supervising expert, will be assigned by the
local government to supervise the construction.
4.8 Road traffic caused by straw transportation
The road transportation in the area of straw resource is well developed. There are three main
roads from the main straw storage facilities to the plant. One is provincial road NO. 223 which is
28m wide. The other two are Second class highway No.317 which is 15m wide and a costal road
which is 7m wide. The potential accidents caused by narrow roads and dangerous turnings are few.
Based on the straw demand of the plant, main traffic flow is estimated as follows:
(1) One delivery of a lorry: 36 bales/ lorry X 400kg=14.4 tons
(2) Daily deliveries to the plant: 500 tons (daily fuel demand) . 14.4 =34.7
(3) Deliveries per hour to the plant: 34.7 + 16=2.16
Three drivers will be set for each lorry and they work in shift during the whole driving hour
of 16. Therefore, they will not be tired and the rate of potential accidents is low.
Straw transportation will be limited during the period from 6 A.M. to 10 P.M., which will not
cause considerable impact caused by traffic noise on local people .
4.9 Environmental Benefits
This project will bring some environmental benefits and positive influences. Rudong
County is short of unrenewable energy resources such as coal, oil or gas and there is no water
43



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
resource at all. The supply of energy wholly depends on import from the other areas. Straw is a
biological energy resource, which is renewable. There will be an evident energy-saving effect to
use the biological energy to take place of the fossil fuel for generating power. The project of
generating energy can save 70,000 tons of standard coal per year, and accordingly reduce the
SO2 by 1,112 tons and CO2, the greenhouse gas by 150,000 tons. Therefore, the environmental
benefit is tremendous.
4.10 Other Assessment Standards
Besides OP4.0 1, the World Bank has other nine standards to protect the natural and social
environments. After checking and analyzing the sites, the environment assessment team has
reached the following conclusions:
*   In the project site, there is no rare wild animals or nature reserves that should be
protected, so no assessment on natural habitat has been made;
*   According to the initial inspection by the assessment team, there is no aboveground
cultural relics on the project site, so the report makes no assessment on cultural
properties; (see attachment: Certificate provided by Rudong Culture Bureau)
*   There is no settlement area of minorities around the project site, so no assessment on
aboriginals has been made;
*   There is no forest around the project site, so it is not necessary to make assessment on
forests and the control of plant diseases and insect pests;
*   The project site involves no controversial area or international watercourse or dam, and
relevant standards are not applied to.

The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
Chapter 5 The public Participation and Information Disclosing
Any project construction will bring about beneficial or disadvantageous influences on the
natural environment or the social environment, and will affect the public benefits in
neighborhood directly or indirectly. Starting from their own benefits, the public will hold
different attitudes to the project. The public participation in the evaluation of the environment
influences is to make the public survey in the evaluation in order to know the attitudes and views
of all social circles.
The aim of the public participation is to know the public attitudes to the project construction,
the scope of the influences on the society, economy and environment so that the evaluation of the
environmental influences can be democratic and open.
According to the requirements of the World Bank and the State General Bureau of Security
and Protection, a survey of relative people at the project site and ambient sensitive regions was
conducted by means of questionnaires from June 20, 2006 to June 30, 2006.
5.1 The Results of the Survey
The requisitioned land was the land used by the brick factory of the Mingxing Construction
Materials Company Ltd. which has been closed. Therefore, there are not dismantlement,
resettlement and compensation of the farmers. The inquisition personnel hand out the
questionnaires to 50 people within the scope of influences by the project. People participating
in the survey are from various strata of the local society, who are very representative. Various
means have been adopted in the survey, such as colloquia questionnaire and interview
questionnaire. The composing proportion of the public is on table 6 and the statistical results are
on table 5-1-1.

5.2 Reply to the Questions that the Public are concerned with
In the survey, the assessment team found that the local people will support the project
construction positively, and hope the project be completed as soon as possible. They have a good
understanding of the impacts on environment, among which noise and dust of the electricity
plant are the main pollutions of the construction. In the consultation, they put forward some
environmental and social questions that they are concerned with. The assessment team together
with the design institute studied these questions carefully and brought about in this report the
measures that will be taken. The replies to the questions are as follows:
(1) Employing the local labor force
The public and local government requests that local farmers should be employed to
participate in the project construction so as to help increase their economic income.
Solution: During the construction period, the construction company will employ a certain
number of local workers. After the technology training, they could participate in the construction
and get their pay for it.
(2) No getting earth from farmland
The public request: Do not get earth from the farmland
Solution: Serious considerations should be taken about the spots of taking and abandoning
earth in the design, and land beyond the requisition can't be occupied. And the preservation of
soil and water should be strengthened at the places of getting and abandoning soil during and
after the construction. The relative regulations must be written down in the biding documents
and be enforced into implementation.
(3) Traffic problems
The public request: During the construction period, the current traffic should not be
influenced and the resident traffic, children schooling and patient hospitalizing have to be kept in
good condition
47



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
Solution: During the construction period the building unit will set up an alarm signal at the
intersection between the 317 Line and central road in the village, warning the people of the
traffic danger. At the same time the vehicle drivers will be provided with safety education and be
forbidden driving at high speed so as to ensure the safety of the pedestrian and other vehicles.
(4) The impacts on the irrigation system and rivers.
The public request: During the constructing progress, agricultural irrigating system should
not be damaged and the normal irrigating work of the farmland should not be affected.
Solution: Before construction, the contractor and constructing personnel must accept
certain education, and be requested to protect the existing irrigation facilities in the constructing
progress, ensure these facilities running smoothly, and prevent the constructing material piling in
the field channel and dumping the earth and stones into the drainage channels.
5.3 Information Disclosing

The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
Charpter6 Conclusions
According to the project's environment impact assessment, we get the main conclusions as
follows:
6.1 Existing Environmental Assessment Conclusions
*   This project is located at the Juegang town of Rudong County, Jiangsu province, where
have no own electrical power supply and the electric network of Jiangsu province
provides all power force. The power shortage of Jiangsu province has hindered the
economic development of the Rudong County to a certain extent. The proposed project
could relax the tense situation of local power force supply and promote the local
economic development;
*   The location of this project is idle land; and there is no rare species;
*   There is no culture relics and historic site near the location;
*    The   land-cover is good and there is no soil erosion;
*   The local air quality of the project is good; the monitoring results of SO2, NO2, and
PMIo are all superior than the requirement of the air quality standards;
*   The main water body of this project is Jiuyao River. The water quality can meet the
requirement of national standard III;
*   The location of this project is in rural area, and the noise level meets national standard
I. It is a quiet area.
6.2 Environmental Impact Assessment Conclusions
*   The proposed project may put some impacts on the water environment of Jiuyao River.
This report has brought about some scientific measures to decrease the impact and
emergence plan to deal with accident, so that environmental impact of this project
could be educed to the minimum degree;
*   The proposed project may put some impacts on atmosphere environment. This report
49



The EIA and EMP of 25MW Biomass Plant from Straw Combustion in Rudong,
has brought about some scientific measures to prevent air pollution, so that the
emission of air pollutants could meet national standard;
*   During construction period, the surrounding residents with the range of 200m may be
influenced by construction noise. When it is in run, there is no noise pollution.
*   During construction period, some plant in the construction site may be destroyed and
lead to a little soil erosion. When this project finished, many proper measures will be
carried out and soil erosion will be completely controlled;
*   Under proper management, the life wastewater and garbage in the construction site
will be dealt with and will not influence the surrounding;
*   After the project is starting, the project can both solve the problem that the straws of
surrounding crops is hard to deal with, and increase the farners' income, so the project
can obtain extensive environmental benefit.
The construction of the project generating electricity with straws in Jiangsu Province can
not only solve the problem that the straws is hard to deal with and the air pollution resulted
from straw buming in harvest season, but also increase the farmers' income. In the other hand,
the straws for electricity generation have many advantages that it can replace the standard
coal 70,000 t/a reduce the SO2 emission 1122 t/a and CO2 15X 104 t/a, and add electricity
20000 X I04 KWh. So this project will in some degree smooth the strain of electricity supply,
and create considerable economic benefits, and improve the life quality of local residents in
some degree. Its environment impacts can be reduced to the minimum through proper method.
So this project gains the positive support of the mass and the local govemment.

7.3.3.2 System of Monitoring Reports
During construction and operation, the environmental monitoring station of Rudong will
compile the environmental monitoring reports. The reports of the construction period will be made
four times a year and the report of the operation period will be made once a year. The reports are
to be handed to the undertakers during the construction period and to the electricity plant
leadership during operation period. The monitoring reports will also be handed to the
Environmental Protection Bureau of Rudong County. The reports will include the monitoring
results and the discussion about environmental quality. If there is the case that the monitoring
results shows the construction is doing against the standards or unexpected negative influence has
been resulted from, the alleviating measures should be worked out and carried out with the
permission of government institution.
The electricity plant, as the owner, will be responsible for having monitoring reports and
putting forward measures related. In special circumstances when the environmental monitoring
unit identifies the remarkable and unexpected negative influence, the owner will check it up, and
arrange to carry out the extra designed alleviating measures.
The construction period will last two years and the forecasting cost of monitoring amounts
to RMB 150 thousand. During operation, the expenses of monitoring are about RMB 25 thousand
a year, and the expenses reserved for emergency monitoring, RMB 100 thousand. After the
proposed electricity plant is in operation, fulltime environmental protection personnel will have to
be assigned, who are in charge of the daily management and maintenance of the facilities of green

7.4 Environmental Protection Personnel Training
To ensure the environment performance of the proposed project and all the above
environmental measures to be carried out perfectly, the personnel concerned should be trained so
as to be competent environmental protection people and to have full understanding and sufficient
knowledge about the typical problems and alleviating measures during construction and operation.
The environmental management is a completely new thing for most management personnel
and engineering technologists in other trades, especially for those in Rudong County and the
management personnel of Jiangsu Guoxin New Energy Development Company Ltd. It is
necessary to provide them with environmental protection training. It is very important to
strengthen environmental management and environment protection training of the personnel in the
management station and make them act properly and in time in dealing with the emergent
accident.
The contents of training mainly include laws of environmental protection, codes,
environment standards, environmental knowledge related to project construction, the
environmental problems and environmental protection measures, especially those concerning the
proposed project, the function of environmental supervision. The personnel trained have also to be
familiar with the emergent plan of the proposed project and the operation procedure in emergency,
and so on.
The training plan of the proposed project is shown in table 7-4-1
