F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The development objective of the three-phase program is to enable commercial renewable
electricity suppliers to provide energy to the electricity market efficiently, cost-effectively, and on
a large scale in three phases.
CRESP Phase I was designed to contribute to the program’s global objective through
development and implementation of the legal and regulatory framework to create and gradually
increase the share of renewable energy-based electricity generation, and to support its effective
implementation in four pilot provinces.
Specifically, the Phase I Project Development Objective (PDO) was to (a) create a legal,
regulatory, and institutional environment conducive to large-scale, renewable-based electricity
generation; and (b) demonstrate early success in large-scale, renewable energy development with
participating local developers in four provinces. For the purpose of this ICR, the PDO description
from the PAD was used.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

achievement)       Bank proposed and the Chinese counterparts agreed to select 4 pilot provinces,
                   which voluntarily agreed to develop RE aggressively even in the absence of a
                   national RE Law. However, increased environmental awareness and China’s
                   commitment in RE Conferences in Bonn and Beijing to speed up RE
                   development led to the preparation of the RE Law in less than a year, with
                   support from the Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies. The RE Law
                   was enacted before project effectiveness, and CRESP supported the preparation,
                   implementation, and monitoring of the supporting regulations.

Comments         Chinese RE equipment, especially wind turbines, improved greatly, and the
(incl. %         number of nationally and internationally certified turbines and exports, even to
achievement) developed countries, increased significantly. Furthermore, due to the booming
                 wind market, all internationally recognized international manufacturers
                 established manufacturing capacity in China, increasing competition and
                 pressure on prices and quality. Four out of the top 10 global wind manufacturers
                 are now Chinese wind manufacturers, and two of them participated in the
                 CRESP’s quality improvement program.

Comments         Target of additional renewable electricity capacity and production has been
(incl. %         significantly surpassed. The increased capacity is 320% higher than the target,
achievement) while the increased electricity production is 143% higher than the target. Power
                 generation increases are less than installed capacity increases because the major
                 increase in capacity is due to wind, which has a lower capacity factor than
                 biomass and small hydropower (SHP).

Comments           Except for SOx, all avoided emissions targets were substantially exceeded: (a)
(incl. %           avoided carbon is 39% higher than the target; (b) avoided NOx is 96% higher
achievement)       than the target; and (c) avoided particulates emissions are 525% higher than the
                   target. Avoided SOx emissions are 64% lower than the target because of the
                   unexpected and dramatic reduction of the power system SOx emission factor
                   from 9,600 tons/TWh in 2000 to 2,100 tons/TWh in 2010. The emission factor
                   was reduced so dramatically because during project implementation, the
                   government made flue gas desulfurization equipment mandatory for all power
                   plants and imposed closing of all small and highly polluting power plants as
                   electricity shortages eased.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environmental Objectives, and Design

Project Context

The China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program (CRESP) is a Bank/Global Environment Facility
(GEF)/Government of China partnership to scale up renewable energy-based electricity. Such a
partnership allows long-term policy dialogues and engagements with the government to support
renewable energy scale-up at the national level and the goals of the government’s Five-Year
Plans (FYP). The CRESP outcome indicators targeted the scale-up of renewable electricity
capacity and production at the national level and were closely linked with the 11th FYP targets.

The backbone of the undertaking is a three-phase GEF grant to develop a legal and policy
framework and support technology improvements, standards and certification, and preparation for
innovative renewable energy projects. The development objective of this three-phase program is
to enable commercial renewable electricity suppliers to provide energy to the electricity market
efficiently, cost-effectively, and on a large scale. Figure 1 below demonstrates the vision of such
a three-phase program (see below for the objective of the first phase, and Section 2.5 for the
objective of the second phase and the envisioned third phase).

The first phase of the CRESP was designed as a programmatic and sector-wide approach to fully
blend: (a) a GEF grant that aimed at developing a legal, regulatory, and policy framework to
create demand for RE and improving quality and reducing costs to build a strong local
manufacturing industry to increase supply; and (b) four investments in wind, biomass, and small
hydro power (SHP) that were among the largest RE investments in China at the time. These
investments were designed to demonstrate quality, efficiency, and sustainability of RE
investments, which were below par in China at the time, for dissemination and replication in
other similar projects in China. The GEF grant also helped troubleshoot and resolve
implementation issues for the RE investments for replication, and supported feasibility studies
and pilot demonstrations for scale-up investments.


                                                1
At the project negotiation, it was decided that the four investments would be provided in two
specific investment loans (SILs) because of portfolio constraints, per request from the Chinese
government. As a result, the GEF grant and the first IBRD loan (consisting of two investments)
were approved by the Board in June 2005, while the Follow-Up Project (second loan for CRESP,
consisting of two additional investments) was approved by the Board in February 2006. This ICR
covers the GEF grant (P067625), and the two Bank SILs associated with it (P067828 and
P096158), as these three projects aimed at achieving the same DO and GEO of CRESP Phase I.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, China was preparing the 11th Five Year Plan (2006-11) and was assessing solutions
and policies to address the following major challenges:

    •   Rapidly growing energy needs as primary energy consumption soared from 1.3 billion
        tons coal equivalent (tce) in 2000 to more than 2 billion tce in 2005 with coal
        consumption accounting for 69 percent of the total and oil imports reaching 144 million
        tons, about 40 percent of the oil consumption.
    •   Increasing local environmental degradation, which led to unacceptable damages to health
        and agriculture and serious curtailments of gross domestic product (GDP) (6–13 percent
        according to different studies).
    •   Increasing engagement with the international community on climate change as China
        signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), and the
        country played a major role in the June 2004 International Renewable Energy Conference
        in Bonn and the following year in Beijing.
    •   Rising vested interests and resistance to the reform of the energy (particularly power)
        sector as little progress has been achieved during the 10th FYP despite bold policy decrees
        and regulations during the first two years of the plan.
    •   Failure to achieve renewable energy targets in the previous (8th and 9th) FYP periods.

Against this background, the Bank and GEF worked closely with the Chinese government to
develop a long-term partnership to support the goals of the 11th FYP and increase, over the longer
term, renewable energy contribution to power generation in a sustainable way. The first phase of
the program, the object of this ICR, focused on mandating an RE market share by law and
regulations and providing incentives to internalize environmental benefits stemming from the
generation of green and nonpolluting electricity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objective of the three-phase CRESP is to enable commercial renewable
electricity suppliers to provide energy to the electricity market efficiently, cost-effectively, and on
a large scale.

Specifically, the PDO for the first phase was to (a) create a legal, regulatory, and institutional
environment conducive to large-scale, renewable-based electricity generation; and (b)
demonstrate early success in large-scale, renewable energy development with participating local
developers in four provinces. For the purpose of this ICR, the PDO description from the PAD,
was used.

Key performance indicators were as follows:
   • Increased renewable electricity capacity (GW) and production (TWh/year);
   • Reduced emissions of carbon, NOx, SOx and particulates;
                                                  2
   •   Market framework established;
   •   Environment for development of renewables improved; and
   •   Improved quality and reduced cost among manufacturers and service providers in wind
       and biomass.

1.3 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

GEO is the same as PDO.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators, and
Reasons and Justification

PDO was not revised.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification.

GEO was not revised.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The GEF-funded Institutional Development and Capacity Building Component supported a range
of beneficiaries:

   •   Policy support activities benefitted all economic agents engaged in the RE supply and
       delivery chain as they clarified and eased market access and ensured sustainability;
   •   Technology improvement activities benefitted selected quality- and innovation-oriented
       Chinese wind and biomass equipment manufacturers and related service suppliers;
   •   Standards, testing and accreditation benefitted the RE industry;
   •   Knowledge activities benefitted selected universities, as well as the students and
       professionals who attended the programs. Ultimately, the industry will also benefit from
       the availability of skilled workers and professionals.

Beneficiaries of the IBRD-financed investment component are the sponsors of the investment
projects, namely, in (a) Fujian: Longyuan Pingtan Wind Power Co., Ltd.; (b) Jiangsu: Jiangsu
Guoxin New Energy Development Company Ltd.; (c) Inner Mongolia: Inner Mongolia North
Long Yuan Power Company Ltd.; and (d) Zhejiang: the 16 investors in SHP projects, including 6
newly constructed plants and 10 rehabilitation projects.

The Chinese population would ultimately benefit from less polluting generation of electricity.
Avoiding increasing reliance on coal will also bring about global benefits and contribute to
climate change mitigation.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

The project comprises two components: (a) an institutional development and capacity building
component (first phase of the GEF program); and (b) an investment component.

The core of CRESP is the institutional development and capacity building component (developed
in three phases). The first phase of the program aims to (a) create a legal, regulatory, and
institutional framework for renewable energy development; and (b) support improved quality and
                                               3
localization of renewable energy equipment and services. Both aspects are considered necessary
to create an environment for significantly scaling up renewable energy development in China.

The investment component in this first phase includes investment in two 100 MW wind farms—
one in Fujian and one in Inner Mongolia—a 25 MW straw-fueled biomass power plant in Jiangsu,
and a 28 MW incremental SHP capacity from new and rehabilitated SHP plants in Zhejiang.

In addition, the institutional development and capacity building component includes support for
building a strong pipeline of renewable energy projects to facilitate scale up. This is done through
(a) support to investors of the investment projects; and (b) support for demonstration projects,
including offshore wind.

1.8 Revised Components

Project components were not revised.

1.9 Other Significant Changes

A number of changes were made during the course of implementation to adapt the support to the
rapidly changing conditions of the RE environment and the needs of clients and stakeholders.
These changes were made to focus on new priorities, reflect lessons learned, and shift resources
to emerging priorities. The GEF resources were allocated to other subcomponents and elements
with a high potential for contribution to the program and achievement of the first phase PDO. All
dropped activities were carried out through government or other bilateral RE programs.

The changes were at subcomponent levels, and did not affect the overall structure of the project.
The main changes made were as follows:

    •   The envisaged support for wind resources assessment at the national and pilot provinces
        level was cancelled, since the government initiated a much larger wind resource
        assessment program for the whole of China. The Government of China program with a
        budget of US$44 million, validated the project concept’s focus on resource assessment,
        and dwarfed the contribution from CRESP (US$2 million at the national level and
        US$4.2 million for the pilot provinces).

    •   The Wind Turbine Technology Transfer element was designed to provide support to wind
        turbine manufacturers to improve quality and develop Chinese brand name megawatt-size
        wind turbines. The subcomponent gained trust and support from industry partners and
        government agencies. During implementation and based on studies carried out by other
        international agencies, the government requested an extension of support to wind turbine
        component manufacturers. Additional budget allocations were made to this activity from
        other subcomponents and elements.

    •   At the request of the pilot provinces, part of the provincial budget was transferred to the
        Provincial Pilot Demonstration Projects to support additional pilot demonstration projects
        and/or to support preparation for offshore wind projects.

    •   To support investors better in implementing Bank-funded projects and in developing a
        more ambitious RE pipeline, a cost-shared grant scheme was developed for the
        preparation of additional renewable energy investments. The support included


                                                 4
A change was made to the Zhejiang SHP subcomponent early on, dropping 2 of the 18
subprojects identified at appraisal. One developer financed his project through local banks, while
the other rehabilitation subproject was dropped by the Bank because of dam safety issues (which
were reported to the regulator). The corresponding portion of the loan was cancelled. Of the
remaining 16 subprojects, 10 were for rehabilitation and 6 were for new construction.

All changes were thoroughly discussed with clients and other stakeholders, and were documented
and approved by Bank management.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Background

Taking into account the context prevailing during project preparation in China (see Section 1.1),
CRESP was designed by taking into account three concurrent facts: (a) China struggled for more
than 10 years (during the 8th and 9th FYPs) to achieve the target for development of 1,000 MW of
wind capacity; (b) GEF indicated its intention to pilot a programmatic approach to support
selected countries in developing and implementing initiatives aiming at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions; and (c) the Bank/GEF Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP) approved in
1999 had to be restructured in 2001 to reduce its wind investment capacity from 190 MW to 20
MW because of debates between government institutions, and ownership disagreements among
different administrative level enterprises, and a lack of clarity on who (consumers at provincial,
regional, or national levels) was responsible for covering the incremental costs between RE and
fossil fuels.

The idea for a large-scale renewable energy program in China, under the WB/GEF Strategic
Partnership for Renewable Energy was first discussed between the World Bank and the National
Reform and Development Commission (NDRC) 1 in April 1999. Despite the problems
encountered in relation to the REDP wind component, the Bank recognized the strong need for
international support for RE development in China and expressed its interest to the government to
continue to support RE scale-up through diversifying its energy portfolio. However, despite the
full support by all agencies of the concept presented in April 1999, building consensus among
different agencies and power operators took time. The Bank and GEF decided to accompany
Chinese agencies as they gradually progressed and gained ownership of the program concept.

The first step consisted of, upon request from NDRC, preparing a Policy Advisory Note on
renewable energy development as an input to the preparation of the 10th FYP. This “Concept Note
on Renewable Energy in China’s 10th Five Year Plan? was dated July 24, 1999.

From 1999 to 2004, NDRC, the World Bank and GEF developed CRESP. Preparation resolved
extended debate on the novel concept of the programmatic approach, following a strengthened
RE policy framework of mandated market policies. The long time it took for Chinese government
agencies to build consensus around the project concept and clarification of the responsibilities


1
  At that time still called the State Development and Planning Commission (SDPC), which at the early
stage of development of CRESP inherited all the responsibilities of the abolished State Economic and
Trade Commission.

                                                   5
among concerned agencies primarily resulted from the prevailing macro-level context during the
early 2000s. With the changes in the highest-level leadership, government agencies were going
through a transformational process to shift from the command and control economy to the
“socialist market economy? and to redefine their role and strengthen their administrative power.
For example, the State Development and Planning Commission (SDPC) merged with the State
Economic and Trade Commission in 2003, and the National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC) was created. As a result, the government implementing agency for the GEF
grant has changed from SDPC to NDRC and later to the National Energy Administration (NEA).

During preparation, a large technical assistance and policy effort was mounted and supported
mainly by GEF PDF B and C and the Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program
(ASTAE) to assist the government in clarifying concepts related to RE scale-up and designing
and developing the RE Law. During the project preparation phase, studies were carried out, and
knowledge and consensus building workshops organized on all RE development aspects: (a)
international experience of many advanced countries on mandated market policies—renewable
energy portfolio standards, feed-in tariff, or concessions; (b) applicability and selection of these
RE mandated market policies in China; (c) development of an original concept for determining
economically optimal RE targets; (d) trading of green certificates; (e) developing the RE Law;
and (f) supporting investors in preparing projects to be financed by the Bank during the first
phase. All these activities were instrumental in transferring knowledge and best practices to
Chinese agencies, assisting them in making informed decisions, and building consensus to
develop the RE Law.

During project preparation, the Chinese government expected that it would take three to five
years to develop and pass a RE Law. Therefore, it was decided to pilot mandated market policies
in four provinces and develop an RE Law for scale-up based on the experience gained. However,
an increased environmental awareness and China’s commitment at the International Conference
for Renewable Energy in Bonn and later in Beijing led to the development of a national RE Law
in less than one year. The law was passed before the approval of the first phase of CRESP and
became effective January 1, 2006. As a result, CRESP focused on making the implementation of
the RE Law a success.

Soundness of Background Analysis

In hindsight, background analysis of the project design (Section 1.1 and the above section) was
sound and adequately identified the issues and barriers to be addressed.

Lessons Taken into Consideration during Preparation

The design of the project incorporated a combination of lessons emerging from international
experience related to renewable energy development and lessons from earlier Bank operations in
China and elsewhere.

Important lessons from international experience indicated that successful RE development
programs required the following:

    •   Well-coordinated programs supported by law, policies, and implementing regulations;
    •   Adequate tariff levels “at a premium price? for RE, reflecting environmental externality,
        with long-term power purchase agreements;
    •   Mandatory off-take of electricity generated by grid operators;
    •   Passing incremental costs between RE and fossil fuels through to consumers;
                                                 6
    •   Setting up national RE targets;
    •   Education, R&D, and information dissemination programs;
    •   Establishment of appropriate standards, certification, and testing of RE equipment to
        ensure quality; and
    •   Reliable assessment of the available resources.

Lessons learned from REDP and other Bank RE projects (limited at that time) and taken into
account in designing CRESP include the following:

    •   RE projects were usually resisted by utilities and required more time and resources to
        build consensus among stakeholders and concerned government agencies, since their
        responsibilities over RE development and oversight were not clearly delineated;
    •   Cost-shared sub-grant approach to support local RE manufacturers works well;
    •   Standards, testing, and certification and technology improvement programs are essential
        to improve quality and sustainability of RE development (the impact of REDP on China’s
        photovoltaic (PV) industry has been well documented);
    •   Single responsibility on wind farm performance is important, and innovative procurement
        approaches are needed to meet Bank and country requirements (Shanghai wind farms
        developed under REDP).

All these lessons have been fully evaluated and incorporated into the project design.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

CRESP was a logical follow-up to REDP. The Bank/GEF established a solid basis and trust with
NDRC and other concerned government agencies that was essential for effective policy dialogue
and scale-up of RE investments. NDRC’s request for preparing a Policy Advisory Note on
renewable energy development during the preparation of the 10th FYP was a clear indication for
the country’s strong interest in building a long-term partnership with the Bank/GEF focusing on
achieving their RE target. The opportunity presented by GEF’s interest in engaging countries on
program rather than project basis was unique and essential to limiting the dominance of coal in
the power sector. The Bank had a clear comparative advantage in establishing the partnership.

With continued Bank involvement, China would also benefit from international experience in
developing the appropriate policies and regulations, and gain knowledge related to technology
improvement, as demonstrated during implementation of REDP. Bank involvement would also
increase the prospect of sound development of RE investment projects leading to optimal use of
resources and increased performance during operation.

Assessment of Project Design

Due to the lengthy preparation, several management changes occurred in the Bank and
counterpart agencies between the original project concept note and presentation to the board, but
the design of the project proved to be robust, and it stood several rounds of scrutiny at the Bank
and at various levels of the Chinese government. The design of CRESP was confirmed each time
as relevant and best fitted to achieving scale-up of RE-based electricity by high management
levels at the Bank and NDRC. The RE Law that adopted mandated market policies, with support
from CRESP and other donors, proved to be the deciding factor for the successful RE scale-up in
China.


                                                7
The long-term engagement with the Chinese government, through the partnership and
programmatic approach, also proved to be robust. The Bank and the government established a
mutual trust relationship, since the government agencies relied mostly on CRESP when they
needed advice and assistance for policy and regulation development. The CRESP introduced
international best practices and mobilized domestic expertise to meet government’s requests. The
recommendations made in many policy studies supported by CRESP have been adopted by policy
makers into laws and regulations.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

The government’s commitment to renewable energy gained momentum over 2000-2003, and
became unwavering after the Bonn RE Conference in 2004, and culminated with the enactment of
the RE Law. The Bank and GEF played a catalytic role in cementing the commitment through all
the analytical work, knowledge activities, and consensus building during the first years of
preparation. Scale-up of RE in China during the last five years has been unprecedented. The
country has become the world’s leader in renewable energy capacity, ranking number 1 in SHP
and wind capacity, number 3 in biomass, and is on its way to achieving leadership in solar PV
capacity. This is a direct result of government’s commitment to RE. The Chinese government
quickly realized that RE is a real “green growth? opportunity. Not only can RE help diversify,
secure, and green the energy portfolio in China, the government also turns this into a new market
niche to build a strong local manufacturing industry for future economic growth.

Participatory Process

The basic ideas of CRESP—programmatic approach, scale-up and the focus of legal and
regulatory framework—were presented and discussed in a “genesis workshop? attended by all
concerned government agencies in late 1999, after GEF’s announced willingness to pilot
programs to scale up renewable energy development. The brainstorming session concluded that a
project based on the proposed ideas is feasible, but would be highly challenging, since it requires
fundamental changes in policy development and project approval processes.

Project preparation built consensus among stakeholders in China on the need for a mandated
market policy for renewable energy development and to provide training to government officials,
institutions, and renewable energy experts to make informed decisions. Consultations with a wide
range of stakeholders, study tours, and studies on international experience were organized to
discuss all aspects of the design of RE policy frameworks.

The participatory approach culminated in a participatory structured brainstorming workshop held
in Beijing on January 21, 2003, to discuss with concerned government agencies and independent
experts different mandated market policies and their applicability to China. Further extensive
consultations were held with relevant stakeholders on different components of the project.
Several of these consultations were organized jointly with bilateral and multilateral agencies and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in China. Finally, pilot provinces were
consulted and involved in the selection of the RE projects to be financed by the Bank during the
first phase of CRESP.




                                                8
Assessment of Risk

The project was rated as high risk/high reward at the concept stage and proved to be challenging,
since it took time to build consensus on the approach and to overcome interagency debates, which
were even more intense than the ones experienced during REDP.

Availability of PDF B and C and ASTAE funding helped in carrying out all analyses, studies, and
knowledge activities to address the issues and questions raised by Chinese counterparts during the
preparation of the project. These activities reduced the risks identified at the concept stage as
counterparts gained ownership of the program design and made progress in the preparation of the
first phase.

This resulted in an overall rating of risk to achieving the PDO as substantial at appraisal. Some of
the risks at appraisal, such as weak government commitment in legal basis for mandated market,
insufficient number of developers, and banks not willing to lend to RE projects, were effectively
addressed by the RE Law. Other risks, such as the commitment to market-based approach,
materialized but did not hamper the PDO of the first phase. Some were addressed in the
amendment of the RE Law and some, such as trade, will be, as envisaged during the original
design, the focus of the second phase of CRESP under preparation.

Quality at Entry Rating by Quality Assurance Group (QAG) (if any)

Satisfactory. QAG assessed that the DO is of high relevance to China. The project builds on
experience in China of piloting projects that are then scaled up. The combination of a GEF
project with a Bank-financed project to combine the investment component with policy and
institutional development is an important strength.

2.2 Implementation

The GEF project progressed slowly at the beginning because of a painstaking and lengthy
consensus building effort among concerned Chinese government agencies and between the PMO
and the Bank/GEF team. Disbursement of the grant was very slow because of diverging opinions
between the PMO and the Bank/GEF team on procurement procedures and fragmentation of
contracts, cost-sharing bidding procedures and their alignment with Chinese decision making, a
piecemeal approach and pace of policy reforms, and the provincial pilot projects and their
replication potential, to single out the four most important ones. These issues were therefore the
major themes discussed during the midterm review of the project. The discussion led to a better
understanding and consensus on the priority issues, agreement on cost-sharing procedures, and a
better focus on grantee needs, alignment of the Bank/GEF team and National Energy
Administration/Energy Research Institute (ERI) team on the scale-up strategy, and better focus on
and replication of successful activities that contributed most to the global development objective
of the project (see detailed recommendations at midterm review section below). This led to
speedier implementation of all activities and allowed total disbursement during the last 18 months
of the project.

The four investment subprojects evolved differently (see Annex 2 for details):
   • The implementation of the Pingtan 100 MW wind farm was highly efficient. The entire
       preparation, detailed design, procurement, implementation, and contract management for
       the wind farm went very smoothly. The project was fully operational by the end of 2007,
       marking an impressive accomplishment. In particular, the project introduced an
       innovative concept of single responsibility on wind farm performance for procurement to
                                                 9
        meet Bank and country requirements. This was possible through a very dynamic and
        hard-working project management team, and the commitment and support of the
        company’s management and leadership, complemented by an effective procurement
        agent.
    •   The Rudong 25 MW biomass-fired power plant changed its location from Mabei Village
        to Yinxing Village, Rudong County, Jiangsu Province. The power plant experienced two
        operational problems during implementation—higher-than-expected moisture content of
        the fuel and the malfunctioning of the biomass straw feeder system (not funded by the
        loan). The first issue was successfully addressed, with GEF support. To mitigate the
        second problem, the project sponsor developed an effective manual feeding system. In
        2011, the plant generated 157 GWh, corresponding to 98 percent of the target set at
        appraisal. In 2012, the output of the plant is expected to meet the generation target.
    •    The SHP projects in Zhejiang province went smoothly. The challenge for SHP projects
        lies in project financing, project management, and addressing safeguard issues. With the
        strong commitment and engagement of the local government and support from the
        Zhejiang Small Hydropower Development and Management Center, the Bank’s financing
        was properly used and the Bank’s safeguards policies were properly followed. During
        implementation, one rehabilitation project and one new construction project were
        dropped. However, the total electricity generation from the 16 sub-projects (rather than
        18 sub-projects as planned) is higher than the original target. In addition, GEF resources
        supported these investors in preparing eight additional new and rehabilitation projects.
        These two factors more than compensated for the cancellation of the two sub-projects.
    •   The completion of the 100 MW Huitengxile wind farm in Inner Mongolia was delayed by
        a year, because of slow procurement and subsequent turbine supply problem. The project
        sponsor—Inner Mongolia North Long Yuan Wind Power Company—changed its
        ownership structure, as Long Yuan Company transferred its share to the Inner Mongolia
        Meng Dian Hua Neng Thermal Power Company Co. Ltd. in December 2008. Part of the
        delay at the beginning of the project was mitigated by accelerated implementation during
        the later years. Nonetheless, the closing date of the project was extended by one year. The
        wind farm became operational in September 2011, selling 79.71 GWh to the grid by the
        end of the year. Electricity generation is expected to reach the target by 2013.

Midterm Review

The midterm review concluded that the project was well on its way to achieving its development
and global objectives, and to meeting, and even exceeding, the performance indicators agreed at
appraisal. In particular, the cost-shared sub-grants and quality assurance activities to support
technology improvements were progressing well.

However, the midterm review also found a few issues of project implementation that were
capable of undermining its achievements and potential—especially at the provincial level. The
main identified problems/risks were as follows:
    • Reduced relevance and weakened policy impact of the studies and activities funded by
        the Grant because of the piecemeal approach and long contract implementation periods;
    • The original approach that had been agreed with the government and adopted during the
        concept stage, that is, piloting different policy options at the provincial level, became
        irrelevant after the enactment of the RE Law in 2005 and its effectiveness in 2006—as it
        established a national framework;
    • Some technical studies, both at the national and provincial levels, were stalled or faced
        major implementation hurdles for two reasons: (a) consultants were not being given

                                               10
        adequate access to data for claimed national security reasons; and (b) there was a
        reluctance to hire and utilize high-level expertise either nationally or internationally; and
    •   Lack of management funds and disruption of PMO functioning that would have led to
        further delays of new activities and weaker supervision of ongoing activities.

The agreed remedies aimed to increase focus on fewer activities, especially at the provincial
level, and greater reliance on the cost-sharing approach with developers and institutions with
strong implementation capabilities. The important recommended actions included the following:
    • Speeding up implementation of the committed contracts to avoid a reduction in the
        relevance of the outputs because of late delivery.
    • Using the uncommitted provincial resources for pipeline building, since provincial level
        policy and resource assessment work is less relevant because of related work at the
        national level.
    • Shifting funding from activities funded by the government or other donors to emerging
        high-priority activities (such as short-term wind forecast).
    • Reducing the number of PMO staff to a core team with adequate knowledge of the
        program and an established track record in implementation—complemented by qualified
        experts to assist with work scope formulation, reviews and evaluation of outputs,
        particularly for complex technical and policy issues.
    • Extending the closing date of CRESP to allow implementation of all committed and
        planned activities.

The recommendations from the midterm review were successfully implemented.

Actions Taken in Response to Problems

Unwarranted delays were experienced during the first year after effectiveness, for the following
reasons: (a) institutional divergence among government agencies; (b) inexperienced PMO staff
and inadequate alignment of PMO staff skills with the project focus areas; and (c) coordination
difficulties between PMO (national level) and provincial Development and Reform Commissions
(DRCs). After the first year, further delays were encountered because of (a) the long time
required to put contracts in place; (b) large number of small contracts; (c) consultants not meeting
agreed deadlines and insufficient follow-up from the PMO; (d) implementation of the sub-grant
projects much more difficult than anticipated and requiring more time; and (e) insufficient
initiatives at the provincial level. The recommendations in the midterm review section above
outlined the actions taken to address these issues.

In addition, the first phase of CRESP encountered an important issue that complicated and
delayed the implementation arrangement. The NEA heavily relied on the Center for Renewable
Energy Development (CRED) under the ERI in charge of major RE policy studies in China.
Contracting other institutions was expected not to be able to achieve the desired impacts, because
other contractors would not have had access to data and recommendations would not have been
considered by the decision makers, weakening the project’s impact on China’s RE policy
development. During the first phase of CRESP, the NEA made it clear that all work related to
decision making had to be carried out by CRED, and it took 6 months to one year for the team to
secure a waiver from Operational Procurement Review Committee (OPRC) to entrust major work
related to the policy decision making to CRED on a single source basis to meet this need.
Furthermore, the PMO needed to be restructured and staffed to ensure independence from
ERI/CRED, directly under the leadership of the NEA.
Performance Ratings

                                                11
Satisfactory. QAG rated the quality of Bank supervision as satisfactory. When QAG conducted a
quality assessment of the lending portfolio in 2008, the project was suffering from the initial
delay because of institutional issues and slow progress of PMO and government agencies along
the learning curve. Nevertheless, QAG noted that the Bank has played a constructive role in
helping the Borrower implement the project with good advice, and was impressed by the quality
of the staff on the Bank team. After the midterm review and the second project restructuring, the
project focused on a lower number of high-priority activities, and implementation accelerated.
The project was successfully completed after an extension of one year and three months beyond
the original closing date.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

M&E Design

As described in Section F of the Results Framework, all the project indicators have been
exceeded, except the SOx emission reduction, because the emission factor was reduced so
dramatically as a result of a mandate by the government to include flue gas desulfurization
equipment for all power plants and to close all small and highly polluting power plants.

The CRESP program has been designed as a Bank, GEF, and Chinese government long-term
partnership to scale up RE before China embraced RE and committed to a momentous
development program. Therefore, the quantitative outcome indicators of the program were
designed as economically justified renewable energy installed capacity and power generation
nationwide (see the detailed methodology in Section 3.3 on economic and financial analysis of
the program). At the time of project preparation, these targets were considered very ambitious.
The fact that the actual results have well exceeded the original targets proved that the design of
the indicators was robust.

However, the lessons learned from the indicator design are the following:

    •   Cost reduction of key renewable energy technologies proved to be difficult to estimate.
        Establishing a cost benchmark is problematic, because of (a) a lack of Chinese indices
        and lack of benchmarks for renewable energy cost; (b) the difficulty of gathering data on
        the cost of equipment, given the concerns over the commercial sensitivity of such
        information; and (c) the influencing of RE costs by factors outside the control of the
        project. Cost of RE is affected by demand and supply, such as surges of raw material
        costs and reduced demand from developed countries because of the financial crisis and
        RE policy changes in these countries.
    •   Emission reductions need to factor in declining emission factors because of the increasing
        use of pollution control measures and improved efficiency of coal-fired power plants.
    •   The impact of policy work is difficult to measure with quantitative indicators.

M&E Implementation

To assess progress towards the targets of the original indicators, the required data were collected
at midterm and at the end of the first phase of CRESP. The data were collected from public
sources (reports and papers) and from project information. The assessment was documented in
detailed indicators reports at midterm and at the end of CRESP. Reliable data to benchmark the
cost of renewable energy equipment could not be collected. All other required data and
information have been collected. The collected data are considered reliable.

                                                12
M&E Utilization

Almost all the project indicators have been surpassed. CRESP pioneered the RE cost supply
curve methodology (see Section 3.3 for details) to estimate the economically justifiable RE
targets at the national level as the program outcome indicators. This methodology provided
analytical inputs to the 11th and 12th FYP RE targets. In addition, the M&E framework was
sufficiently well developed to provide clear guidance of what CRESP set out to achieve. The
indicators were useful for gauging project progress and helping the PMO and the Bank to focus
on areas of implementation that were lagging. PDO indicators were used at the mid-term review
to evaluate likelihood of achievement of the project and global objectives.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

There were no major safeguard issues encountered. The minor issues encountered and resolved
during project implementation are discussed below.

Environment. Overall environmental performance of all four investment projects is satisfactory.
In Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, there were no significant issues with implementation of the
environmental aspects of the project or environmental management activities.

Inner Mongolia wind farm. One significant environmental issue was experienced. Early on
during construction, poor access to roads had led to trucks driving through grassland, which
caused unacceptable impacts. Corrective efforts were made at the request of the Bank’s
supervision teams. In addition, the external environmental supervisor was engaged by the
company only in 2010 to strengthen the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) implementation.

Resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement for all investment projects have been
satisfactorily implemented. All compensation have been paid to the affected people based on the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), all relocated households have completed the construction of
replacement houses, and all proposed rehabilitation measures indicated in the RAP have been
implemented for the affected villages. Income and livelihood of the affected people have been
restored and even increased compared with that before resettlement. Issues encountered during
implementation, and their resolution, are discussed below.

   •   In Jiangsu, the change of the site for the Rudong Biomass Power Plant necessitated the
       preparation of new EMP and RAP. After changing the site location, the developer was
       unable to purchase the land required for fuel storage. The issue was resolved in a
       satisfactory manner, as the owners proposed and the developer agreed to lease rather than
       purchase the land required for fuel storage.
   •   In Inner Mongolia, the original estimate of land acquisition for access roads had to be
       updated, as the extent of land acquisition was different compared to the original, and the
       extent of temporary and permanent land occupation had to be clarified. The site plan was
       revised, and the updated RAP was submitted and approved by the Bank.

Fiduciary

Procurement. Procurement performance is rated as satisfactory.



                                              13
Under the GEF project, procurement was carried out in accordance with Bank procurement
policies and procedures. No major issues were encountered. The prior and post review identified
minor procurement issues. In May 2009, a complaint was submitted to the Bank with regard to a
Consultants’ Qualifications (CQ) selection performed under a provincial activity in Jiangsu
Province. The case was reviewed by the Bank’s EAP Regional Procurement Secretariat team, and
the assignment was canceled during the project’s Midterm Review.

There were no major issues for the investment projects, other than the delays experienced in the
completion of the bidding process in Inner Mongolia.

Financial management. Financial management performance under all three projects was
satisfactory.

The financial management system developed for the lending and GEF projects was adequate and
provided, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information that the loan and grant were
being used for the intended purposes. The project accounting and financial reporting were in line
with the regulations issued by the MOF and the requirements specified in legal agreements. In
addition, the withdrawal procedure and fund flow arrangements were appropriate throughout the
project implementation. The loan and grant proceeds have been disbursed to the project in a
timely manner.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, operation & maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The investments financed under CRESP are diverse, and transition arrangements differed:

    •   The Fujian Pingtan 100 MW wind farm is operational since the end of 2007 by the Long
        Yuan Pingtan Wind Power Company Ltd., which is the largest and most successful wind
        developer in China and beneficiary of a Bank loan under REDP to develop two small
        wind farms in Shanghai. The arrangements they made for the operation of their wind
        farm are up to international industry standards and the wind farm has one of, if not the,
        highest capacity factors in the region. The success of this project has led to a potential
        request from Long Yuan Company for the Bank loan to invest in offshore wind farms.
    •   The Rudong 25 MW biomass unit was included in the investment program as a pilot unit
        because the assessment carried out by the bank during preparation indicated that technical
        and fuel supply issues were not addressed properly. The unit was first commissioned in
        2009, and encountered serious problems with fuel-feeding equipment (not financed by
        the Bank) and quality of fuel (moisture and storage), common problems facing many
        other biomass power plants in China. As CRESP earmarked GEF funds to support the
        investors, these were used to assess the problems encountered and propose solutions to
        address them. The remedies, including a Biomass Fuel Supply Handbook, financed by
        ESMAP, were disseminated by the CRESP PMO and benefitted other units facing the
        same problems. The unit has been operated and maintained according to industry
        standards since 2010.
    •   The Zhejiang SHP component included rehabilitation and construction of several units.
        Most of them were completed early during project implementation and are operating
        satisfactorily and supervised by the Zhejiang Small Hydropower Development and
        Management Center, the most prestigious SHP center in China, under a contract financed
        by CRESP GEF grant. The Center provided technical assistance during construction and
                                               14
        supervised the operation after commissioning. It also provided guidance and training to
        investors to ensure sound operation and maintenance of the plants. In March 2011,
        experts and officials from the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Water Resources
        visited one SHP subproject in Zhejiang, and heard the report on the practice of the first
        phase of CRESP. Inspired by this successful project and others, in July 2011, the
        government allocated dedicated budget from a special fund earmarked for renewable
        energy to support six provinces, including Zhejiang, to pilot capacity expansion and
        efficiency improvement in the rehabilitation of SHP in rural areas.

Looking forward, CRESP aims to move RE development in China from the successful
quantitative scale-up under the first phase to qualitative and sustainable scale-up under the second
phase. The objective of the second phase of CRESP is to support Chinese government’s 12th FYP
to enable efficient and sustainable scale-up of commercial renewable energy development
through reduction of incremental costs, efficiency improvement, and smooth integration to power
systems, thereby contributing to the government’s target of reduction in carbon intensity, as
shown in Figure 1. Preparation of the second phase of CRESP began during the last year of
implementation of the first phase. The concept of the second phase has already been approved by
the Bank management and the GEF Council. Afterwards, the envisioned third phase of CRESP,
coinciding with the 13th FYP (2016–20), the last FYP to achieve the 15 percent non–fossil fuel
target, is envisioned to fully integrate RE in competitive and open power markets.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

The scale-up of renewable electricity efficiently, cost-effectively, and on a large scale is not only
still highly relevant, but has become more urgent and essential as China’s energy consumption
continues to grow rapidly and coal remains predominant in electricity generation. China became
the largest CO2 emitter in the world despite its recognized successes in reducing energy intensity
and as scale-up of renewable energy during the 11th FYP. RE development to combat climate
change became a priority:

    •   In China as the country committed to increase the share of non–fossil fuel in its primary
        energy consumption to 15 percent in 2020, in which RE accounts for more than 12
        percent, and reduce carbon intensity by 40–45 percent from 2005 to 2020;
    •   Globally as the international community increasingly allocates funds to promote low-
        carbon technologies for electricity generation;
    •   In the Bank Country Partnership Strategy to China as it focuses on energy efficiency and
        development and use of clean and renewable energy technologies.

At the CRESP closing workshop, high-level government officials praised the significant
contributions that CRESP made to China’s renewable energy scale-up, and reconfirmed that
CRESP remains highly relevant to the government’s priorities and commitment to renewable
energy scale-up.

The design and implementation of the program were also reviewed during the early stages of the
second phase and confirmed as still relevant by the following:

    •   Chinese authorities and the GEF focal point that allocate significant funds to undertake
        the second phase;

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

For the first phase of CRESP, the PDO and GEO are the same:

   •   Create a legal, regulatory, and institutional environment conducive to large-scale,
       renewable-based electricity generation; and
   •   Demonstrate early success in large-scale renewable energy development with
       participating local developers in four provinces.

CRESP has made significant contributions to the legal, regulatory, and policy framework for
scaling up renewable energy in China, and catalyzed government investment in and support to RE
development on a large scale during the 11th FYP. The outputs, outcomes, and achievements of
CRESP are categorized in the following three key pillars.

(1) Renewable Energy Policy Support:

CRESP has strongly influenced the development of RE legal, policy, and regulatory framework
in China, through supporting policy studies and technical assistance to help develop and
implement the RE Law. The RE Law and ensuing regulations triggered an “RE rush? that led to
an unprecedented development of wind capacity, followed by PV, biomass, and other
technologies.

During project preparation, CRESP provided critical inputs to the government in developing the
mandated market policies and the RE Law, in particular, selecting the mandated market policies
for China and designing the mechanism of cost sharing for incremental costs. The RE Law was
passed quickly, leaving many details for implementation in the follow-up regulations.

During project implementation, the recommendations made in many policy studies supported by
CRESP have been adopted by policy makers into laws and regulations. CRESP-supported policy
studies have led to the issuance of nine supporting RE policies and regulations. For example,
CRESP-supported studies on RE targets, RE quota, cost-sharing mechanisms, and financial
incentives have provided essential inputs to the amendment of the RE Law.

In particular, the feed-in tariff regulations are the cornerstone of RE policies in China, and
CRESP played an instrumental role in developing these regulations. For example, based on the
results from the wind concession schemes, CRESP supported a wind pricing study laid a solid
analytical foundation for and led to the issuance of Notice of Improved Feed-in Tariff for Wind
(2009). Similarly, CRESP-supported biomass studies have provided critical inputs and led to the
issuance of Notice of Improved Feed-in Tariff for Biomass (2010) and Regulation on Subsidy for
Biomass (2008).

In addition, CRESP-funded technology strategies and roadmaps for key RE technologies have
provided inputs to the 12th FYP RE programs. In particular, the SHP policy studies and Zhejiang
SHP investments put SHP back on the national agenda. Furthermore, CRESP also supported RE
planning and technology strategies in the four pilot provinces, and proposed a “green county?
concept, which led to the issuance of the Notice on Recommendation of Green County (2009).

(2) Technology improvements for wind and biomass:


                                              16
Building a strong local RE manufacturing industry is a top priority and a key driver for RE
development in China. CRESP played an essential role in the rapid growth and quality
improvement of the domestic wind, and to a less extent, biomass manufacturing industry, through
cost-shared subgrants and establishment of standards, testing, and certification facilities. In
particular, the cost-shared subgrant approach to support domestic wind and solar manufacturers
worked well and proved to be cost effective under both the first phase of CRESP and REDP
projects. Before CRESP started, Chinese wind manufacturers were struggling to produce
megawatt-scale wind turbines and secure international quality certification. CRESP supported
five local wind manufacturers to overcome these problems. At the end of the first phase of
CRESP, four domestic wind manufacturers have won Level A certification for their megawatt-
scale wind turbine design, and in particular, Sewind secured type certification for its 2 MW wind
turbine design from internationally recognized wind turbine certification center.

CRESP also supported the development of 8 wind turbine standards based on best international
practice. All of them were adopted as national standards by SAC. CRESP also supported the
establishment of 2 wind turbine testing centers and 2 wind turbine certification centers accredited
by ISO/IEC Guidelines. As a result, wind turbine testing and certification services up to
international standards are now available locally and widely used by local manufacturing industry
for marketing and quality assurance.

Furthermore, CRESP also supported (a) short-term wind forecasting in Inner Mongolia, a critical
technique and method to smooth grid integration of wind power; and (b) the development of the
first university curriculum on wind power engineering in China and academic and post-academic
training.

Finally, CRESP also supported 10 biomass equipment manufacturers through cost-shared sub-
grants to improve biomass gasification technologies and address biomass fuel management issues.

(3) RE investment support:

CRESP has contributed to large-scale RE investments by supporting 2 x 100 MW wind farms in
Fujian and Inner Mongolia, a 25 MW biomass power plant in Jiangsu, and 16 SHP plants with a
total installed capacity of 24 MW. These investments are among the largest RE investments in
their categories at the time. The investments focused on quality, efficiency, and sustainability of
the built infrastructure when many of RE projects were below par in China and exhibited low
capacity factors and/or technical problems that hampered their connection to the grid. Equipment
improvements, adequate designs, and technical standards developed under CRESP and financed
by GEF grants were disseminated and profited numerous similar projects in China.

    •   The Fujian Pingtan 100 MW wind farm was among the largest wind farm investment at
        the time, demonstrating successful design, implementation and completion of a large-
        scale wind farm. The annual electricity generation exceeded the target, with the capacity
        factor as one of the highest in the country. The project set high standards for large-scale
        wind farms in China and is considered best practice in the country. The project
        introduced and facilitated transfer of international best available technologies, improved
        quality and reduced cost, and set up cost benchmarks through international competitive
        bidding;
    •   The Rudong 25 MW biomass-fired power plant is one of the first of its kind in China.
        The project proved to be a very useful pilot for addressing the kinds of issues that can be
        encountered in fuel supply, collection, and storage, as well as power plant operation. The
        experience has benefitted other similar biomass plants. See Annex 2 for details;

                                                17
    •   The SHP projects in Zhejiang province enhanced technical and management capacity of
        local small and medium-size enterprises, increased their access to financing, and
        improved SHP technical design, environmental and social safeguard, and installed
        capacity at project sites. The implementation of the project proved that there is a huge
        potential for SHP capacity expansion and efficiency improvements through rehabilitation
        to increase electricity production and reduce emissions at low cost.

Finally, CRESP also assisted RE developers in identifying and preparing more than 1,000 MW of
new RE investments through cost-shared sub-grant support to the investors and pilot
demonstration of new RE technologies in various parts of the country under the GEF grant.

3.3 Efficiency

Economic and financial analysis of the CRESP Program:

The rigorous and innovative economic and financial analysis done for CRESP provided a solid
analytical basis to set up economically justified RE targets. This analysis set the standard for
economic and financial analysis of renewable energy development programs and projects in other
countries. The economic and financial analysis had two main objectives: (a) to assess what
quantity of renewable energy development could be justified by the avoidance of the
environmental externalities of coal-based generation; and (b) to estimate the economic and
financial impacts of increasing renewable energy generation by a mandated market policy.

One of the main thrusts of the study related to quantifying environmental externalities of coal-
fired power generation and preparing renewable energy generation cost curves to establish the
quantity of renewable energy development that was justified. The study established a
methodology for this analysis that has since been used in the evaluation of renewable energy
programs in countries, such as Croatia, Indonesia, Mexico, Serbia, and South Africa.

The analysis went beyond determining the effects of renewable energy development policies and
targets on different elements of Chinese society—electricity consumers, actors in the energy
sector, and the overall impact on the GDP. It also looked at the regional development impacts of
renewable energy policies and targets, since many of the wind and hydro resources are in the less
developed western provinces, while the main consumption of electricity is in the eastern part of
the country. The economic and financial analysis quantified and compared the impacts of
different mandated renewable energy policies and targets. Finally, the risks associated with
renewable energy were assessed.

This comprehensive analysis was carried out over an extended period during project preparation,
from 2000–03. There was constant interaction between the Chinese leadership, the Chinese expert
team, and the Bank technical team on the implications of the analysis.

Economic and financial analysis of the investment projects:

The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) were
recalculated based on the same methodology used at appraisal and using costs and benefits
prevailing at the completion of the project. The results of the calculation at ICR and appraisal are
summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Annex 3.

The EIRRs and FIRRs of the Jiangsu biomass and the Inner Mongolia wind projects are lower
than appraisal because of the unforeseen surge in commodity prices, which increased the

                                                18
investment cost. In addition, biomass fuel prices from agriculture residues also increased during
project implementation of the Jiangsu biomass project, a common problem for biomass power
plants in China.

The Fujian wind farm was less affected by the surge in commodity prices, since it was completed
very early during project implementation. It achieved higher EIRR and FIRR than appraisal
because the actual capacity factor and wind feed-in tariff are higher than at appraisal.

The actual EIRRs and FIRRs for SHP rehabilitation and new construction are, except for one
project, higher than at appraisal because rehabilitation projects and most projects constructed at
early stage of implementation were not affected by the surge in commodity prices.

Overall, even the reduced EIRRs remain higher than NDRC’s 8 percent discount rate. Some
FIRRs are lower than the usually 8 percent expected by Chinese developers, but most of these
projects were developed on a pilot basis.

                      Table 1: EIRRs and FIRRs at ICR and Appraisal
 Project                EIRR (%)              FIRR (%)         Brief Explanation:

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Achievement of PDO/GEO is rated Highly Satisfactory

With substantial support for legal, policy, and institutional frameworks under the CRESP starting
in 2005, RE has experienced an unprecedented growth during the 11th FYP. China has become
the world’s leader in renewable energy capacity—now at 8 percent of total primary energy and
targeted to reach 15 percent by 2020. In particular, China’s wind capacity has doubled every year
since 2005, from 1 GW in 2005 jumping to 62 GW in 2011, the largest in the world. The
government’s commitment to 30 GW of wind by 2020 at the International RE Conference has
already been achieved 10 years ahead of time, and an extremely ambitious target of 150 GW by
2020 is under consideration. China also has the world’s largest SHP capacity, and substantially
increased its installed biomass power capacity to 5 GW in 2010. CRESP catalyzed these
achievements primarily through its support and strong influence to the RE Law and policies,
which is the deciding factor for the scale-up of RE in China. Many of the policy studies supported
by CRESP have led to issuance of RE Law, supporting regulations, and RE Law amendment.

In addition, the Chinese wind manufacturing industry has leapfrogged from a marginal status in
megawatt-scale wind turbines manufacturing at the beginning of the project to a global leader.
Today, 4 out of the top 10 global wind manufacturers are Chinese. The growing status and size of
the Chinese wind turbine manufacturing has influenced the global market by increasing
competition and lowering wind turbine prices. The quality improvement and cost reduction of the
Chinese wind manufacturing industry has benefitted China and the world. To this end, CRESP
                                                  19
made significant contributions to the rapid growth and quality improvements of the Chinese wind
manufacturing industry through cost-shared sub-grants for technology improvements, and
establishment of standards, testing, and certification centers for quality assurance.

Furthermore, the piloting of large-scale RE investments improved quality, efficiency, and
technical standards and reduced costs of RE investments, which were disseminated and replicated
in similar projects in China. CRESP also supported identification and preparation for more than
1,000 MW of new RE investments and pilot demonstration of innovative new RE technologies,
which catalyzed large-scale RE investments in China.

In summary, the first phase of CRESP played an essential role in the scale-up of renewable
energy in China. At the project closing, China’s renewable energy scale-up has been
accomplished in a short period, and the PDO and GEO have been achieved and surpassed. All the
PDO/GEO indicators have been well exceeded, except the SO2 emissions reduction because of
the dramatic reduction of the emission factor of the power system. Therefore, a “Highly
Satisfactory? rating is justified.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The establishment of an enabling environment for large-scale development of renewable energy
contributed to the huge scaling-up of renewable energy in general and wind in particular, creating
employment in the renewable energy industry. According to the 2010 China Wind Power Outlook,
the employment in the wind industry alone was 202,000 people in 2009 and this could reach more
than 400,000 in 2020. According to the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association
(CREIA) the renewable energy industry as a whole employed 1.12 million people in 2008 and is
adding 100,000 jobs each year.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The CRESP program has substantially strengthened the institutional capacity of the following key
stakeholders:

    •   Government agencies and think tanks: CRESP has improved their capacity in
        developing and implementing RE policies through introduction of international
        experience and provision of expertise and technical assistance.
    •   RE manufacturing industry: Under the cost-shared subgrant technology improvement
        component, CRESP improved the technology development capacity of the local
        manufacturing industry, which learned technology transfer mechanisms and international
        certification process for quality improvements under the project. As a result, some of the
        participating manufacturers now follow the same approach and process to develop more
        advanced and larger-capacity wind turbines on their own.
    •   Wind turbine testing and certification centers: Under CRESP, two wind turbine
        testing and two certification centers were established and operational. GEF grants
        supported, on a cost sharing basis, the centers, and the project required these centers to
        obtain China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS)
        accreditation according to ISO/IEC Guide 25. In addition, CRESP also created a market
        for their services, since five wind turbine manufacturers supported by the project need
        testing and certification services to obtain type certification.

                                               20
    •   RE developers: The investment projects, support to investors, and pilot demonstrations
        all increased the capacity of RE developers through the introduction of international best
        practices to improve quality and efficiency.
    •   Future generations: CRESP has already made important impacts on long-term capacity
        of the major industry operators through support to university programs and post-
        academic training in wind power technologies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

No unintended outcomes and impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A stakeholder workshop was held at project closing. High-level government officials attended the
project closing stakeholder workshop, and commended the significant contributions that CRESP
made to China’s renewable energy scale-up. In particular, they highlighted that CRESP has
strongly influenced RE policy development, RE Law and regulations in China; and played an
essential role in the rapid growth and quality improvement of the domestic wind manufacturing
industry. CRESP is the largest international cooperation partnership and GEF project in the
renewable energy field. There is a strong government commitment in RE and ownership for the
CRESP concept.

The PMO conducted a survey among sub-grant recipients, and also organized a separate
workshop with project beneficiaries after the project closing workshop. Many of the respondents
acknowledged that CRESP support has accelerated and improved wind development in China.
All the beneficiaries expressed their gratitude to the support received through CRESP. They
benefitted not only from the GEF funding, but also from learning international best practice and
gaining credibility and reputation because of their involvement with the World Bank/GEF. All the
beneficiaries confirmed that the cost-shared sub-grant approach is quite effective. The sub-grant
recipients appreciated the support for prefeasibility and feasibility studies, because it reduces the
financial risk of project preparation. The small amount of cost-shared grant to support
prefeasibility and feasibility studies had a high leverage impact of actual investments materialized.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Low

The risks to sustaining the development outcomes are minimal, and longer-term sustainability of
the achievements of the first phase of CRESP are highly likely.

CRESP supported the development of an enabling environment for scaling up renewable energy
development. The developed conducive RE policy framework and the government’s strong
commitment to the ambitious RE targets will ensure that renewable electricity development will
continue on an increasing scale. The legal and regulatory framework is in place and will continue
to be developed, and the second phase of CRESP will continue to assist the government in
adapting RE policies to the new barriers and challenges to achieve government’s RE targets in a
more efficient and market-oriented way.

The RE industry will continue to grow. The wind turbine testing and certification centers are
expected to flourish, since their services would be more and more sought by wind manufacturers.
Quality improvement and certification are essential to gain market share domestically and
                                                21
internationally. With the growing market, the training institutions will also see an increasing
demand.

Based on the above, it is concluded that the risk to sustaining the development outcome is
negligible to low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The concept and its relevance to China’s situation in the early 2000s have been confirmed by
Bank management and Chinese authorities after numerous reviews and assessments during the
preparation phase. Engagement of the Chinese institutes about the CRESP concept could not have
been delayed, otherwise China would have missed an opportunity to build the long-term
partnership with GEF and the Bank for scaling up renewable energy. Faced with major challenges,
the Bank was resilient and took advantage of the preparation period to build institutional
knowledge, to support the prerequisite RE Law and policies for the success and sustainability of
the scale up, and to pave the way to more market-oriented means to achieving economy and
efficiency. All the policies explored and evaluated during the preparation period are now under
consideration by the Chinese government and will be supported during the second phase.

The studies and analytical and knowledge transfer activities carried out during the preparation
period led to building consensus and ownership of the concept by Chinese government agencies,
resulting in the enactment of the RE Law before effectiveness, and to defining diversified lending
investments that proved essential to RE scale-up. The continued engagement of government
agencies during preparation and Bank management support at the highest level ensured the
quality at entry of the program and investments related to the first phase.

The development of the RE Law is the cornerstone of RE policy and scale-up in China. During
project preparation, the Bank team mobilized GEF PDF B, PDF C, and substantial amount of
ASTAE funds to help the Chinese government prepare the RE Law. These large-scale TA
activities stood on their own, and are beyond the support normally provided by the Bank during
project preparation. The impact of these technical assistance activities proved to be a
transformative catalyst for RE scale-up in China and changed the mindset of Chinese institutions.
Because of this specific factor and others noted above, Bank performance in ensuring quality at
entry is rated as highly satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The implementation of CRESP required intensive supervision, especially at the early stages of
implementation as the PMO struggled with both the substance and process issues. It was critical
to providing assistance to the PMO to continue the consultation process and engagement of all
stakeholders and to avoid interference in implementation issues that were the responsibility of the
grantees and investment implementing agencies. In between the formal biannual supervision
missions, the Bank organized technical assistance missions by Bank staff and consultants to
                                                22
provide implementation guidance, advise the PMO, and provide training where and when
required. Gradually, the PMO came to a more balanced sharing of responsibilities as they focused
more on analytical, technical assistance and knowledge transfer at the national level. The
commitment and pooling of GEF/Bank/ASTAE resources were instrumental in keeping the
project on track.

The first phase implementation suffered from frequent changes in project leadership from both
sides—change in PMO leadership and transfer of the project from the NDRC to the NEA on the
client side, and six task managers in five years on the Bank side due to staff retirement and move
to other regions. The impact of this large turnover slowed the implementation somewhat, but did
not seriously disrupt the Bank/client dialogue because the project progress and issues that were
faced have been candidly and faithfully documented. The Aide Memoires and mission reports
allowed new task managers to take stock of the progress achieved and issues that required their
attention. In addition, the team has ensured continuity by retaining the first TTL as a consultant
and a core project team.

Finally, the Bank showed a great deal of flexibility and willingness to make the necessary
adjustments as experience was gained to adapt the implementation of the project to the evolving
conditions of the country. Three examples are worth mentioning: (a) the reallocation of the
resources assessment to other priority tasks when the government allocated substantial funds to
the activities originally included in the project; (b) the increased focus on biomass technologies
and fuel supply issues after the problems encountered by the biomass investment project and
other pilot biomass projects in the country; and (c) the extension of subgrant schemes as they
proved to be more results-oriented than studies and analytical work at the provincial level. All
changes have been thoroughly discussed with Chinese counterparts, documented, and
implemented after amending the legal documents.

The supervision of the project was reviewed by QAG and rated as Satisfactory. It is also rated as
satisfactory at the ICR stage.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team focused on development effectiveness and sustainability of RE scale-up, and
demonstrated flexibility to meet client’s demand during project preparation and implementation.
The Bank team also provided intensive assistance to the PMO and made best efforts to provide
timely solutions to major issues encountered. Overall, the Bank performance is rated as
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The achievements catalyzed by CRESP could not have been achieved without an unwavering
commitment of the government to RE scale-up once the consensus was achieved around the
outcomes of the program. This is clearly indicated by the enactment, enforcement, and
implementation of the RE Law with unprecedented speed and transparency. This commitment
propelled the country to the forefront of global RE development.

                                               23
In addition, the Government of China places a high priority on the CRESP program. At the outset
of the program, the Letter of Sector Development Policy was provided to the Bank by the Vice
Minister of NDRC in charge of infrastructure. It demonstrated the government’s strong
commitment to RE and its support for the long-term partnership of the CRESP program. During
project implementation, senior government officials often requested CRESP support for
analytical and advisory studies as inputs to key RE policies and regulations. The Vice Minister of
the NEA and many senior government officials attended the project closing workshop and
acknowledged the significant contributions that CRESP made to China’s RE scale-up, which
demonstrated strong ownership of the program from the government.

It is the government’s unwavering commitment to RE and the early passage of the RE Law that
led to the unprecedented achievement of RE scale-up in China. Therefore, the government
performance is rated overall as Highly Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The CRESP PMO struggled in the first two years to digest the concept and define its role in
implementing the GEF policy component and the investments linked to the first phase of the
program. They also struggled with Bank procurement procedures and focused more on details
than the broader objectives of the program. In particular, the PMO implemented a large number
of small contracts. This led to a noticeable lag in disbursement of the grant. However, after
reducing the number of staff and streamlining their procedures, they managed not only to
effectively coordinate the sometimes challenging policy tasks, but they also took actions to
complete all tasks in a satisfactory manner and achieve the effective disbursement after the
extension of the closing date by one year.

Two achievements are worth noting: first, the efforts provided by some of the PMO staff during a
supervision mission that allowed developing and securing Bank approval of the Wind Turbine
Technology Transfer (WTTT) in two weeks; second, the PMO carried out all activities related to
financial reporting and fiduciary supervision in a highly satisfactory manner. The PMO’s
performance is therefore rated as satisfactory.

As for the investors, the overall performance is rated as satisfactory:
    (a) the performance of the Longyuan Pingtan Wind Power Co., Ltd. is rated Highly
        Satisfactory because of their innovative efforts in procuring, designing, and implementing
        the project in a short time without compromising the quality and performance of the
        infrastructure;
    (b) the Jiangsu Guoxin New Energy Development Company Ltd. is rated Satisfactory as the
        company managed to take the needed action to correct teething problems;
    (c) the Zhejiang Provincial Hydropower Development and Management Center’s
        performance is rated as Highly Satisfactory, as the Center played a major role in guiding
        small public and private investors to design and implement the investment projects with
        strict adherence to Bank procurement and safeguards rules; and
    (d) the Inner Mongolia North Long Yuan Power Company Ltd.’s performance is rated
        Moderately Satisfactory because of lengthy time it took to finalize the ownership and
        licensing of the project company, the weak commitment to environmental and social
        issues, which led to a serious delay in project implementation.


                                               24
Overall, the performance of implementing agencies is rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Despite the difficulties encountered during the implementation of the innovative project concept
and the long delays at the beginning of project implementation, the government showed strong
commitment to RE and took full ownership of this program. All government agencies and
grant/loan beneficiaries deployed the needed efforts to deliver the project outputs and achieve its
goals, and most of the time, surpass its outcomes and indicators. The Borrower’s performance is
therefore rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The factors contributed to the success of CRESP are the following:

    •   Long-term engagement with the government through the partnership program has
        paid off: The CRESP program is the only window in the Bank’s China energy portfolio
        that engages long-term RE policy dialogues and partnership with the NEA. The long-
        term engagement has built trust between the Bank team and the government, which often
        turns to the Bank team and the CRESP program for support and inputs to key policy
        decisions. This created a high demand from the government and a wide range of
        stakeholders for technical assistance and capacity building provided by the GEF grant.

    •   A programmatic approach, which blends policy dialogue, technical assistance, and
        investments through IBRD/GEF funding, is the best conduit for scaling up RE in
        client countries. Combining policy support and technical assistance through a GEF grant
        with large-scale long-term financing for RE investments through IBRD loans in one
        package is the most effective and powerful tool to enable transformational changes to
        scale up renewable energy. Such a programmatic approach not only provides just-in-time
        assistance to the government on policy decision making for RE scale-up, but also helps
        troubleshoot and resolve implementation issues for the RE investments for replication
        and scale-up. This is particularly true at the beginning stage of RE development in a
        client country, but such a programmatic approach is not always possible, and sometimes
        can be substituted by projects blended with grants (bilateral) or concessional loans (e.g.
        Clean Technology Fund).

    •   Flexible approach to adapt to government’s priorities and changing environment is
        required: This is because RE policies require frequent adjustments as RE technologies
        evolve and make progress towards competitiveness. The flexible design of CRESP
        contributed to its successful implementation. CRESP provided timely assistance to the
        Chinese government and adapted the GEF-funded activities to the decision-making
        process. Since the policy environment changed quite fast in China, flexibility and
        adaptation were essential to meet the government’s requests and achieve the project’s
        objective. This approach can be very useful in most countries engaging in RE scale-up
        with Bank assistance.

    •   Cost-shared sub-grant approach is well suited to support knowledge transfer and
        technology improvements for domestic manufacturers: The cost-shared sub-grant
        approach for technology improvement was tested and proven under REDP. CRESP again
                                                25
        validated the success of the cost-sharing approach. Cost-sharing activities led in all cases
        to a higher leverage of the grant, and increased ownership and commitment by
        implementing counterparts. For example, the cost-shared sub-grants for the Technology
        Improvement component leveraged three times the GEF grant from sub-grant recipients.
        Such a cost-sharing approach also works well for prefeasibility and feasibility studies for
        potential RE developers. This approach can be replicated in other countries as it leads to
        full ownership of the funded activities by the grantees and greater commitment to
        achieving their outcomes.

    •   Improving manufacturing quality is essential for the transition to a world-class
        manufacturing industry: The key to the success of the wind technology improvement
        component was to simultaneously address wind turbine standards, testing, and
        certification, and to support wind manufacturers in developing megawatt-scale wind
        turbines. Chinese manufacturers have long been recognized as low-cost producers,
        although the poor quality and a lack of certification up to international standards had
        undermined their reputation in the global market. Thanks to CRESP support, four
        domestic wind turbine manufacturers received Design Level A Certification by
        certification institutes up to international standards. The benefits of a strong and
        competitive local market, driving continuous product development and innovation have
        not only benefitted Chinese consumers, but will also extend benefits globally.

The important lessons learned are the following:

    •   The piecemeal approach and fragmentation of policy study contracts resulted in
        lengthy delays and weakened policy impacts: During project implementation, the PMO
        issued a large number of small contracts. Fragmentation of policy studies is detrimental
        to quality and leads to higher transaction costs and lower impacts on government policy
        making, especially when not linked to the planning process of the government. This is an
        important lesson learned for the second phase of CRESP, as alternative approaches to
        deliver policy technical assistance are being explored to limit the number of contracts and
        focus on major issues.

    •   A core project management team, with contributions from world-class international
        and Chinese experts is most cost effective: Relying on recruitment of a large number
        short-term staff is not conducive to high-quality management because of the reluctance of
        high-caliber experts to be involved in full-time and somewhat administrative activities.
        There is evidence from the first phase that hiring a core team to carry out management
        and due diligence tasks with contributions of international and Chinese world class
        experts is more cost effective and conducive to higher-quality management.

    •   Programmatic approach needs intensive supervision from the Bank team: CRESP
        required intensive supervision to provide guidance and advice to the PMO in
        implementing the large number of activities under CRESP. The supervision also included
        capacity building for the PMO. The supervision requirement exceeded the supervision
        budget. The required supervision could only be provided by combining supervision
        missions of different projects and through the financial support from ASTAE.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The Borrower/implementing agencies agreed with most the content of the ICR. They made a few
minor corrections. For example, one additional wind turbine standard supported by the project is
now adopted by SAC. They pointed out that wind power capacity in China jumped to number 1 in
the world last year. They also suggested that the threshold of prior review for consultancy
services was too low.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

CRESP Phase 1 was a complex project with a large number of, in many cases, related activities.
CRESP Phase 1 comprised two components: (a) institutional development and capacity building
component; and (b) investment component.

The successful investment component included investments in a 100 MW wind farm in Fujian, a
100 MW wind farm in Inner Mongolia, a 25 MW straw-fueled biomass power plant in Jiangsu
and 28 MW incremental SHP capacity from new and rehabilitated SHP plants in Zhejiang. While
supporting large-scale RE investments is very important, the core of CRESP Phase 1 lies in its
institutional development and capacity building component that made the biggest difference in
RE scale-up in China.

The institutional development and capacity building component comprised four subcomponents:
(a) national level institutional development and capacity building; (b) provincial institutional
development and capacity building; (c) capacity building investors and scale-up support; and (d)
project management. The subcomponents were further subdivided in elements and sub-elements
(see Table A2.1). Table A2.a presents the situation at closure of CRESP Phase 1.

The outputs, outcomes, and achievements of the CRESP program can be summarized in the
following three key pillars: (a) Renewable energy (RE) policy studies; (b) technology
improvement for wind and biomass; and (c) RE investment support, including investment
projects, pilot demonstration, and pipeline building.

(1) Renewable Energy (RE) Policy Studies

                                              30
An effective RE policy framework is a prerequisite for RE scale-up. The national level policy
activities comprised 25 tasks. Table A2.5 (at the end of this annex) lists these tasks, as well as
outputs and outcomes of each task.

First, the national level policy activities contributed to the creation of a legal and regulatory
environment conducive to large-scale development of renewable electricity generation. The
outputs of the RE policy studies were used to develop regulations under the RE Law and as inputs
to the amendment of the RE Law. CRESP-supported policy studies have led to the issuance of
nine supporting RE policies (see Table A2.2). In particular, CRESP-supported studies on RE
targets, RE quota, financial incentives, and cost sharing mechanism of incremental cost have
provided essential inputs to the preparation for the Energy Law and the amendment of the RE
Law, which was adopted at the 12th session of the Standing Committee of the 11th NPC on
December 26, 2009 and became effective on April 1, 2010.

The feed-in tariff regulations are the cornerstone for RE policies in China. After the RE Law
became effective in 2006, more rounds of wind concession bidding were carried out by the
NDRC/NEA. They were quite effective in reducing costs and establishing cost benchmarks as a
pricing finding mechanism to establish feed-in tariffs later on. However, they produced mixed
results—some bidders were induced to bid too low, and the signed contracts were not
materialized in some cases. Based on the results from the wind concession schemes, CRESP
supported a wind pricing study laid a solid analytical foundation for and led to the issuance of
Notice of Improved Feed-in Tariff for Wind.

The development of solar PV followed a similar path—evolving from concessions to feed-in
tariffs, and a CRESP-supported solar PV study also made important contributions to the issuance
of Feed-in Tariff for Solar PV, Notice on Implementation for Golden Sun Project, and Interim
Management Regulations on Financial Subsidy for Solar PV on Buildings.

The feed-in tariffs for biomass went through several rounds of revision during implementation.
First of all, the prices of biomass fuels (straw from agriculture residues) turned out to be much
higher than originally anticipated for many biomass-fired power plants. As a result, the feed-in
tariffs for biomass have been adjusted upward to factor in the fluctuation of biomass fuel prices.
Second, the original biomass feed-in tariffs were designed as a fixed premium on top of baseline
prices (based on coal-fired power plants) in each province, which resulted in a large discrepancy
of biomass tariffs in different parts of the country. Again, CRESP-supported biomass studies have
provided critical inputs and led to the issuance of Notice of Improved Feed-in Tariff for Biomass
and Regulation on Subsidy for Biomass.

Second, CRESP-funded technology strategies and roadmaps for key RE technologies have
provided inputs to the 12th FYP RE programs. In particular, the SHP policy studies and Zhejiang
SHP investments put SHP back on the national agenda. SHP is the least-cost RE technology.
Hence, developing SHP more quickly would allow for meeting the RE target without increasing
the incremental cost of the program. However, currently there are no national-level financial
incentive policies for SHP, and China still has a large untapped potential of SHP and
rehabilitation. In addition, CRESP-supported biomass and biogas studies have led to issuance of
government’s regulations of the Notice on Management Regulation of Agricultural and Forestry
Biomass Combustion Power generation and Notice for Collection and Management of Livestock
and Landfill Biogas for Power generation. Finally, the CRESP-supported green county study,
which focused on developing criteria for the “green county? denomination and related
management regulations, has led to the issuance of the Notice on Recommendation of Green
County.

Third, at the provincial level, RE policy activities were carried out in each of the four pilot
provinces. Ten policy related tasks were carried out in Jiangsu, 10 in Zhejiang, 5 in Fujian, and 8
in Inner Mongolia. The pilot provinces used the GEF resources in particular to support their
renewable energy planning through preparation of wind, PV, and biomass development plans and
to support the preparation of the 12th FYP for renewable energy.

(2) Technology Improvement (TI)

TI for Wind: Technology Improvement of wind turbines focused on quality improvements, cost
reduction, and efficiency enhancement through supporting local wind turbine manufacturers to
produce megawatt-scale wind turbines and assisting in establishment of wind turbine standards,
testing, and certification systems. The TI wind component, therefore, included (a) WTTT support
and (b) Quality Control (standards, testing and certification). In addition, the Technology
Improvement component supported the development of short-term wind power output forecasting
capabilities and development of a pool well-trained wind energy practitioners (long-term capacity
building).

Wind Turbine Technology Transfer

Under WTTT, CRESP supported 5 Chinese wind turbine manufacturers (Windey, Sewind,
Dongfang, Goldwind, and Sinovel) to develop Chinese brand name megawatt-size wind turbines
type-certified to international standards. The wind turbines developed by these manufacturers
under CRESP all obtained design certification GL Level A or equivalent, and Sewind even
obtained type certification by TUV Nord (November 2011). For the others, type certification is
still ongoing and expected to be obtained in 2012.

Support was provided by cost-sharing projects designed by the manufacturers. The five
manufacturers were competitively selected to participate. Requiring certification at international
level was very demanding and proved to be much more difficult than anticipated. The benefits,
however, outweighed the costs and challenges. It set a clear target, reaching type-certification up
to international standards, which was applied to all participants. Certification bodies would assess
whether or not the target was met. The intended outcome was not only the success of the wind
turbines development in the market, but also the establishment of design capabilities that could be
used for developing other wind turbines that meet international quality standards.

Windey developed a 1.5 MW wind turbine, Sewind a 2 MW wind turbine, Dongfang and
Goldwind 2.5 MW wind turbines and Sinovel a 3 MW wind turbine. Total sales of the wind
turbines developed with CRESP support were 3,516 (Sewind 1,098, Goldwind 627, Windey 893,
and Sinovel 898, while Dongfang produced only 2 prototypes). This achievement is above
expectations.

During implementation of the WTTT subelement, the scope was increased to also support one
manufacturer of wind turbine main shaft bearings and one manufacturer of equipment for the
installation of wind turbines in the intertidal area. The manufacturers were uniquely qualified or
the only interested party. With the support from CRESP, Wafangdian Bearing Group Co., Ltd.
developed a main shaft bearing for the Sinovel 3 MW wind turbine and obtained the ability to
develop main shaft bearings for the large wind turbines of other manufacturers. At the end of
CRESP, the manufacturer supplied 40 main shaft bearings to Sinovel and had contracts for an
additional 500. The manufacturer procured the required equipment, software, and training.
Provided that the required quality levels can be maintained, localization of the manufacturing of
main shaft bearings will have long-term cost-effective impacts and reduce the dependence on


                                                33
imported main shaft bearing. Bearings for large wind turbines are at times hard to obtain because
of high international demand and restricted supply.

With the support from CRESP, Sinovel developed installation equipment for intertidal wind
turbines. An intertidal installation process was developed, including two 40 ton and two 150 ton
cranes. The four units were used to conduct a trial placement of an offshore installation platform
also developed within the project. This technology has been installed and operated at the first
Chinese intertidal wind farm in Shanghai, and will likely be used for future intertidal projects by
Sinovel and possibly other developers.

Quality Control

Standards: Standards development under CRESP Phase 1 aimed to develop Chinese standards in
line with existing IEC standards for wind, and facilitate China to become an active partner in
developing future IEC standards for wind. The latter would automatically mean that future
international standards would easily be adopted as Chinese standards. To develop Chinese
standards in line with existing IEC standards, CRESP Phase 1 established a Standards Committee
consisting of renowned Chinese wind standards experts and one international wind standards
expert.

The Standards Committee formulated eight wind standards (Table A2.3), all of which have
formally adopted as Chinese (GB) standards. CRESP also facilitated China to become a member
of the IEC/TC88 Working Group, which is responsible for formulating IEC wind-related
standards. The IEC/TC88 Working Group is now working on preparing an IEC standard for wind
turbine blades based on the Chinese standard for wind turbine blades (GB/T25384-2010 Turbine
blades of wind turbine generator system). The participation of China in the TC88 is considered
important for China and is continued with financial support from the MOST and wind turbine
manufacturers in China. The envisaged outcome of an infrastructure for development of wind
standards has been achieved.

Under another element, China Electric Power Research Institute (CEPRI) and WINDTEST
developed and tested an industrial professional standard (NB standard) for measurement of wind
farm power quality.

Testing: As China’s wind industry boomed, the government asked CRESP to support two wind
turbine testing centers and two certification bodies instead of one of each. Furthermore, the
support focused more cost-shared sub-grants instead of consultant services contracts and
procurement of goods, given the success of the former approach. The latter change was made to
increase flexibility and make cost sharing by the recipients easier.

CRESP supported two testing institutions in China to acquire the technical skills, procedures, and
equipment to perform tests required for type certification of wind turbines. These skills are not
only required for type testing, but also useful for wind turbine manufacturers in developing and
testing of their wind turbines. CRESP Phase 1 supported the Wind Test Centre (WTC) and Wind
Power Integration Research and Evaluation Centre under the CEPRI to obtain CNAS
accreditation for measuring (a) power performance; (b) power quality; (c) mechanical load; and
(d) acoustic noise. WTC obtained CNAS accreditation for these tests on June 20, 2011, and
CEPRI on July 19, 2011. As of August 31, 2011, WTC had contracts for conducting 40 tests (of
which 15 were completed), and CEPRI completed 47 tests and has contracts for type certification
tests for 8 wind turbine manufacturers. This indicates that the envisaged outcome of accredited
wind testing centers operational on a sustainable basis has been achieved.

CRESP also supported the development of an innovative wind test center in Inner Mongolia. The
test center offers wind turbine manufacturers to test their turbines at the wind rich test site in
Inner Mongolia. The cost of testing is recovered from sales of electricity generated by the
prototypes. The wind test center in Inner Mongolia has a cooperation agreement with CEPRI,
which has been accredited to carry out the required tests.

Certification: Certification (or conformity assessment) of wind turbines is a procedure by which
a third party gives written assurance that a wind turbine or a wind turbine component conforms to
specified requirements (IEC standard or otherwise). Certification is important to provide
transparency for control of quality. CRESP supported two certification bodies in China to obtain
internationally recognized formal accreditation for design and type certification of wind turbines
and wind turbine components. The certification bodies are the China General Certification Center
(CGC) and the China Classification Society (CCS). Both are accredited by the CNAS according
to ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 and the Chinese equivalent. Certification of wind turbines by both
CGC and CCS are based on the IEC standard IEC 61400-22 Conformity Testing and
Certification, which is the successor of IEC WT 01. CGC and CCS cannot certify wind turbines
based on the GL standard (Germanischer Lloyd standard). As of August 2011, CGC had 96
contracts for design certification, 12 contracts for type certification, 89 contracts for component
certification, and 8 contracts for project certification. CCS has 6 contracts for design certification,
6 contracts for type certification, and 95 contracts for component certification.

Short-Term Power Output Forecasting

To strengthen local short-term power output forecasting capabilities, a sophisticated approach
was adopted, comparing forecasts made by Garrad Hassan and by CEPRI. SgurrEnergy, an
independent third party, compared the forecasts of 8 wind farms with actual performance. The
outcome was that the accuracy of the forecasting of power output was moderate for both
institutions. CRESP cost shared the development of the model by CEPRI by providing a


                                                  35
subgrant. CEPRI continues to use the model developed to provide short-term power output
forecasting services on a commercial basis.

Long-Term Capacity Building Wind

In Germany with an installed wind capacity of 27 GW, 90,000 technical experts are employed.
For the planned 200 GW in China, an estimated 400,000 technical experts will be required. The
objective of the long-term capacity building wind subelement was to create a pool of well-trained
wind energy professionals needed by a fast-growing wind industry in China. CRESP supported
two training centers to develop post-academic training courses for wind practitioners and one
university to develop a Master of Science (M.Sc.) program for wind power engineering.

The M.Sc. program developed by the North China Electric Power University is fully operational.
The first students with a M.Sc. Wind Power Engineering will be delivered in 2012. Northwestern
Polytechnical University (NPU) and Suzhou Long Yuan BaiLu developed post-academic training
courses and modules for wind practitioners. CRESP supported the development of training
materials and equipment, and the training of trainers. Under CRESP, NPU provided training to
731 people in 11 training courses. In addition, 357 people were trained in 5 seminars in China
(290 people) and 4 seminars in Germany (67 people). Suzhou Long Yuan BaiLu trained 165
technical wind experts. The M.Sc. and post-academic training courses will continue to be
conducted after closure of CRESP Phase 1.

TI for Biomass: The Competitive Grant Facility (CGF) Biomass was intended to get new and
improved biomass energy equipment into the market. This would be achieved by encouraging
manufacturers to invest in development of new, or improvement of existing, biomass energy
equipment. In order to be successful in the market, the equipment must be of superior quality
and/or lower cost. To encourage manufacturers to invest in technology improvement, CRESP
Phase 1 offered to cost share projects that aimed to do this. Projects were selected on a
competitive basis. During CRESP Phase 1, two rounds of tender were organized, and a total of 10
projects were selected for support from CRESP. Among those 10 projects, 5 developed biomass
briquetting equipment, 4 developed gasifier equipment (the gasifier itself, cracking of producer
gas tar and water treatment system for gasifier effluent), and 1 developed equipment for
collection of crop residues. All but one project were rated satisfactory or highly satisfactory. The
intended output was the new or improved equipment. Nine out of the 10 projects achieved the
intended output. The intended outcome was new or improved equipment will be successfully
adopted in the market. At least two projects are considered highly successful, while two were
considered successful in terms of outcomes. For the other projects, it was too early to judge the
outcome. See Table A2.4 for detailed outputs and outcomes under technology improvements.

(3) RE investment support

Scale-up through pilot demonstration

Demonstration of renewable electricity technologies contributes to scaling up renewable
electricity investments. Under the Competitive Grant Facility—Pilot Demonstration Project
(CGF-PDP), CRESP supported the identification and preparation of renewable energy
demonstration projects in the pilot provinces. To select the projects receiving CRESP support, a
tender system was used. First, project ideas were submitted to the respective provincial DRCs that
selected the most promising project ideas. The proponents of the selected project ideas were
requested to prepare full-fledged project proposals. A proposal evaluation committee selected 8
projects to receive funding under this facility. Projects included biomass gasification, biogas,
biomass-fueled CHP, PV, ecological buildings and heat pumps. One project (heat pump in Inner
Mongolia) had to be cancelled, since required approvals could not be obtained.

Although CRESP supported only identification and preparation, all 7 projects supported were
realized. The outputs and outcomes are summarized in Table A2.6 (at the end of this annex). The
total renewable electricity capacity of these 7 projects is 7.5 MW. Particular noteworthy is the
support for the 5 MW fixed bed biomass gasification plant in Jiangsu. This is the largest biomass
gasifier in China. The plant was commissioned in August 2011 and is operating without
difficulties.

In addition to the competitive selected projects, 5 additional demonstration projects were
supported using the reallocated funds from the provincial policy support. These projects included
tidal power in Zhejiang, biogas in Inner Mongolia, and offshore wind in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and
Fujian. The total capacity of the envisaged projects is 370 MW. At present, it is not yet known
how much will actually be build.

Scale-up through pipeline building

During implementation of CRESP, it was decided to provide pipeline building support through
subgrants to the investors using the Investors Scale-up Support Facility (IFFS). Under this facility
investors could propose pipeline building projects. The PMO would review the proposals and
approve funding as far as the allocation for each investor would allow.



                                                 37
Under this facility, 14 projects were approved: 3 ISSF projects for Jiangsu Guoxin, 9 IFFS
projects in Zhejiang, 1 ISSF projects for China Long Yuan Power Group, and 1 ISSF project for
Inner Mongolia North Longyuan Wind Power Corporation. The outputs and outcomes of the 14
projects are summarized in Table A2.7 (at the end of this annex). These 14 projects resulted in an
additional renewable electricity capacity of 149 MW (actually build) and may lead to an
additional 918 MW renewable electricity generation capacity (envisaged).

Investment Component

Fujian Wind. The China Long Yuan Power Group Corp. installed 50x2.0 MW Vestas wind
turbines on Pingtan Island in Fujian (total capacity 100 MW). All 50 units were operational on
December 31, 2007.

Both the outputs and outcomes have been achieved and surpassed. The annual electricity
generation exceeded the projected value of 260 GWh in the feasibility study. This project has
resulted in improved experience and expertise in international competitive bidding, enhanced
capacity, and scale-up of renewable energy investments by the project sponsor—China Long
Yuan Power Group Corp.

The GEF grant under the Institutional development and capacity building component was used to
contract consultants to provide management support to the developer in the bidding process. In
addition, the CRESP GEF resources were also used to finalize the wind farm improvement
program initiated under the REDP.

Jiangsu Biomass. A 25 MW straw-fired biomass power plant was installed at Yinxing Village,
Rudong County, Jiangsu, which started commercial operation on July 1, 2008. The plant sold
141.2 GWh of renewable electricity into the grid in 2010.

The location was changed from Mabei Village to Yinxing Village, Rudong County, Jiangsu
Province. Approval procedures were properly followed. 2

The Jiangsu Rudong Biomass Power Plant faced two issues during implementation—higher-than-
expected moisture content of the fuel and breakdown of the straw-feeding equipment. The first
issue was addressed with GEF support by using residual heat from the boiler to dry the fuel prior
to use. The second challenge faced was the breaking down of the straw preprocessing system and
feeding system in 2009. Guoxin attempted to resolve the issue with the original manufacturer,
which was unable to find a solution. Thereafter Guoxin approached four other companies to try to
resolve the issue. However, because of the very specific nature of the system being used, the
automatic straw-feeding equipment was not replaced. The second issue was more challenging,
since there is limited experience in processing rice straw in China and around the world. Little
progress has been made to date in the research organized by the project company and supported
by equipment suppliers and some universities and research institutes. In the meantime, Guoxin
developed an effective manual feeding system, and the unit is currently operating satisfactorily.

In 2011, the plant generated 157 GWh, corresponding to 98 percent of the target set at appraisal,
and in 2012, the output of the plant is expected to meet the generation target.

 In additional to the local approval, No Objection Letter (NOL) was issued by the Bank (sector manager)
as the provided EIA/EMP, RAP, and FSR were revised and satisfactory to the Bank.

Jiangsu Guoxin gained a wealth of experience by implementing this project. This experience is
being applied in new biomass power projects of the owner.

The GEF resources from the institutional development and capacity building component for
Jiangsu, Guoxin, were used to contract consultants to provide management support, including
support in the bidding process, for construction, supervision, and fuel supply chain optimization.

Zhejiang SHP. The SHP investment under CRESP set out to establish an incremental SHP
capacity of 28 MW and sell an incremental 95 GWh/year into the local grid.

The IBRD loan financed the construction of 6 new SHP projects and the rehabilitation of 10 SHP
projects in Zhejiang. The total capacity of the 6 newly constructed SHP projects was 13.6 MW
and the incremental capacity of the 10 rehabilitated SHP plants was 9.91 MW (the total capacity
of the rehabilitated SHP plants increased from 26.38 MW to 36.29 MW). The total incremental
capacity was, therefore, 23.51 MW, which is 4.49 MW below the target of 28 MW. This shortfall
is caused by cancellation of 2 subprojects (one new and one rehabilitation).

The 6 new projects generated electricity of 40.07 GWh and the 10 rehabilitated projects 119.71
GWh in 2010, of which 63.71 GWh was incremental electricity generation. The total incremental
electricity of the Zhejiang SHP projects financed from the IBRD loan sold to the grid in 2010 was
thus 103.78 GWh. This exceeds the target. The target will be exceeded further, since three new
plants (two rehabilitated and one new) have not yet operated at full capacity because construction
was only completed in 2010. Once fully operational, these three plants are expected to generate
electricity of 16.8 GWh. The shortfall in incremental capacity is more than compensated by the
additional SHP projects under the ISSF.

The outcome includes cost benchmarks and proof of the cost effectiveness of SHP rehabilitation,
as well as increased capacity and scale-up of SHP investments by the SHP developer
beneficiaries.

GEF resources under the institutional development and capacity building component were used in
Zhejiang to support the Zhejiang Hydropower Management Center (ZHMC), which oversaw the
implementation of the 16 new and rehabilitation SHP projects. The ZHMC provided technical
advice to these small SHP developers, organized training, guided the investors to strictly adhere
to Bank’s safeguards requirements and monitored implementation of EMP and RAP, organized
procurement for the investors according to the Bank’s procurement guidelines, and monitored
implementation progress and reported to the CRESP PMO.

Inner Mongolia Wind: The Inner Mongolia North Longyuan Wind Power Company installed
80x1.5MW Suzlon wind turbines at Huitengxile, Desheng County, Inner Mongolia. All turbines
were operational in September 2011, and the wind farm sold 79.71 GWh to the grid in 2011. The
annual electricity generation is expected to reach the target by 2013.

Huitengxile, Desheng County, Inner Mongolia, gained knowledge and experience in international
competitive bidding, and improved capacity of its staff and scaled up renewable energy
investments.

GEF resources from the institutional development and capacity building component for the Inner
Mongolia investor were used to provide assistance in the bidding process and in monitoring the
implementation of the EMP and RAP. In addition, CRESP supported training for staff of the
investor by the Suzhou Longyuan Bailu Wind Power Vocational Training Center.

Economic Analysis

The economic analyses of the investment subcomponents were conducted at appraisal to justify
their economic viability. Cost-benefit analyses were carried out to estimate the EIRRs of the four
investment subcomponents, including (a) Fujian Pingtan Wind Power Generation Project
(100MW); (b) Jiangsu Rudong Biomass Power Generation Project (25MW); (c) Inner Mongolia
Huitengxile Wind Power Generation Project (100MW); and (d) Zhejiang Small Hydropower
Development Project. Using the same methodology, the EIRRs were recalculated at the time of
ICR.

Fujian Pingtan Wind Farm: The EIRR was recalculated at 16.1 percent, higher than estimated
during project preparation (13.6 percent). The increase is mainly caused by (a) higher annual
generation than planned; and (b) higher on-grid tariff applied in the region. The annual utilization
hours of Fujian Pingtan Wind Farm was about 3,000 hours, 400 hours higher than the estimate at
appraisal, while the on-grid tariff is 0.539 Y/kWh (VAT excluded), about 0.07 Y/kWh higher
than the estimate at appraisal.

     Table A3.1. EIRR Calculation for Fujian Pingtan Wind Farm Generation Project




Jiangsu Rudong Biomass Power: The EIRR was recalculated at 11.6 percent, less than
estimated during project preparation (20.8 percent). The low EIRR is mainly caused by (a)
operation problems occurred from 2008 to 2010 which resulted in a low generation in these years;
and (b) higher fuel price than expected—the average straw price at plant gate was about 300
Y/ton in 2011 (equivalent to 950 Y/tce), about 40 percent higher than the estimate at project
preparation.

Inner Mongolia Wind Farm: The EIRR was recalculated at 9.3 percent, less than estimated
during project preparation (12.5 percent). The low EIRR is mainly caused by (a) an overrun of
investment cost by about 20 percent; (b) delayed project commissioning schedule; and (c) less
generation than estimated as a result of grid integration bottleneck—the power cutoff was about
20 percent of its available generation in the first three quarters in 2011.

Zhejiang SHP: The EIRRs were recalculated for all 16 SHP stations, including 10 rehabilitation
and 6 new projects. The EIRRs of the 10 rehabilitated projects were ranged from 10 to 195
percent while the EIRRs of the 6 new projects were ranged from 10 to 22 percent. The EIRRs of
most rehabilitated projects were higher than estimated during project preparation (for all projects
ranging from 10 to 33 percent).

Financial Analysis

The financial analyses of the four investment subcomponents were carried out using the same
methodology adopted during the project preparation, and the FIRRs were recalculated. It was
found that:
    • The FIRR of Fujian Pingtan Wind Power Generation Project was recalculated at 10.9
        percent, higher than the estimated at project appraisal (6.5 percent).
    • The FIRRs of both Jiangsu Rudong Biomass Power and Inner Mongolia Huitengxile
        Wind Power Generation Project were recalculated at 5.0 and 5.1 percent, respectively,
        lower than the estimated at project appraisal (10.6 percent for the Jiangsu Rudong
        Biomass Power project and 7.0 percent for the Huitengxile wind farm without carbon
        financing).
    • The FIRRs of Zhejiang Small Hydropower Development Project varied: they were
        ranged from 6 to 102 percent for the 10 rehabilitated projects and ranged from 6 to 16
        percent for the other 6 new projects. The FIRRs of most SHP projects were higher than or
        close to those estimated during project preparation (between 7 and 16 percent for all
        projects).

Summary

The EIRRs and FIRRs for the four investment subcomponents were summarized and compared in

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

At the end of CRESP Phase 1, the CRESP PMO conducted a survey to assess the benefits of
CRESP Phase 1 for subgrant recipients. The five remaining PMO staff also made a self-
assessment. The results of these assessments are presented in Annex 5.

                             Subgrant Recipients Survey Results

In total 36 questionnaires were returned to the PMO. Table A5.1 gives a breakdown by facility.

The questionnaire included questions such as the following:

    •   Why was the support from CRESP through the subgrant important to you?
    •   What would have been different without the support from CRESP?
    •   What did you like about the support provided by CRESP?
    •   What did you not like about the way the support was provided?
    •   If CRESP had to do the subgrant project again, what should CRESP do differently?
    •   What is in your opinion the importance of CRESP for the renewable energy industry in
        general?

In addition, the questionnaire included 10 statements for which the respondents were asked to
what extent they agreed with these statements from 0 to 10 in which 0 means total disagreement
and 10 total agreement. These statements were as follows:

    •   Without support from CRESP, we would have done exactly the same.
    •   With the support from CRESP, we did more than we would have done without the
        support from CRESP.
    •   With the support from CRESP, we did a better job than we would have done without the
        support from CRESP.
    •   The technical conditions for the support from CRESP were clear.
    •   The technical conditions for the support from CRESP were too demanding.
    •   The subgrant approach worked well.
    •   The PMO was strict, but very helpful during the implementation of the subgrant project.
    •   CRESP was very important to the development of the renewable energy industry in
        China.
    •   Achieving the agreed milestones was more difficult than anticipated.
    •   A different support than provided by CRESP would have been more useful to us.


Summary of Results

                                              56
Clearly the financial support provided by the project is considered the most important. However,
many of the respondents highlighted that they benefitted from international experience and
expertise by involving more international experts than they would have done without the support
from CRESP. Despite the reluctance to hire international experts initially, many respondents
mentioned the involvement of international experts is one of the success factors. Furthermore,
they also appreciated the advice provided by the international experts contracted by the PMO to
assess progress and check achievement of milestones. This feedback reinforced the idea that
requires subgrant recipients to involve more international experts not only to gain cutting-edge
global knowledge but also to be in contact with relevant international organizations and
institutions for future follow-up. In the future, the PMO should insist more involvement of
international experts to guide the development process.

Many of the respondents acknowledged that CRESP support has accelerated and improved wind
development in China. The beneficiaries highlighted that CRESP support improved the
technology development capacity of local manufacturing industry, taught Chinese manufacturers
technology transfer mechanisms and international certification process. As a result, some of the
participating manufacturers now follow the same approach and process to develop more advanced
and larger capacity wind turbines on their own. Furthermore, the support from the World
Bank/GEF also helped them gain credibility and reputation.

The use of subgrants to support project identification and preparation worked extremely well.
Almost all of the projects for which CRESP supported preparation work have been or will be
realized. The subgrant recipients appreciate this support because it reduces the financial risk of
project preparation, which is considered the highest risk of a project. The relative small amount of
support had a high leverage impact of actual investments. This is a very efficient way to scale up
renewable energy investments and is recommended for replication in CRESP Phase 2 or in other
projects.

The PMO has not only a fiduciary role, but also provides guidance and advice to the subgrant
recipients. In particular the latter role was highly appreciated by the subgrant recipients.

When replicating the subgrant approach under other project it is advised to study the details of the
approach adopted by CRESP. Many of the details contributed to the success.

Overall the responses were very positive and indicate that a continuation of this kind support
under CRESP Phase 2 would be appropriate.

Details on the outcomes by facility are provided below.

Wind Turbine Technology Transfer (WTTT)

The five beneficiary wind turbine manufacturers mention that the financial support was the
important. However, it was not only the money. Three respondents mention specifically that the
reputation, both national and international, was important and that they felt honored to be selected
to participate. Some mentioned that participation accelerated development and that the
certification requirement helped to substantially improve quality. The CRESP support also
provided access to international experts who provided valuable advice.

According to the respondents, without the support of CRESP they might not have gone through
certification. Development of the turbine might have been quicker, but this would have been a
mistake. All consider certification important as a quality statement and as a marketing advantage.

                                                57
Certification also opened up the export market for the certified wind turbines. Sewind mentioned
that they experienced a lot of difficulties during the two years of type certification. Without
CRESP they would not have designed the W2000 type wind turbine and obtain type certification.

On the question of what they liked most about the way the CRESP support was provided, three
respondents stated that they liked most the advice from the foreign experts, while two liked most
the financial support provided. Two respondents stated that they also liked the project design with
clear milestones and a step-by-step approach. Also the management by the PMO was very much
appreciated. When they ran into one of the many problems, the PMO always communicated very
effectively and suggested solutions.

Suggestions for improvement of the WTTT facility include more financial support (Dongfang and
Sinovel), more intensive involvement of CRESP team for smoother implementation (Sewind),
strengthen the project management team (Goldwind) and make payments based on completion of
tasks and not as a percentage of actual cost after reaching a milestone (Windey).

Without the support of CRESP, the respondents would have done something different. Because of
the support of CRESP, they did more and did a better job at it. The conditions of the support from
CRESP were clear, but type certification was demanding. Reaching the specified milestones was
somewhat more difficult than anticipated. The subgrant approach worked very well, and the PMO
was very helpful in implementing the WTTT projects.

The responses from the Wafangdian Bearing Group were very detailed and clear. The most
striking points are the following:

    •   The financial support was important. Wafangdian had already invested Y 1.5 billion in
        the development of bearings for MW size wind turbines. CRESP support released some
        of the funding pressure.
    •   Without the support from CRESP, engaging foreign experts and procurement of
        advanced design software (RomaxDesign) would have been much more difficult.
        Wafangdian would have to rely more on its own experts and would have been restricted
        to domestic design software. This would have delayed development and might have
        impacted quality.

For developing installation equipment for intertidal wind turbines, Sinovel appears to be
interested only in the financial support provided. The CRESP contribution may have contributed
to implementing the project faster and better.

Wind Turbine Testing (WTTC)

The CRESP support was more important to the China Wind Test Centre (WTC) than to CEPRI.
The support was valuable to CEPRI, since it (a) provided financing; (b) provided the chance to
establish cooperation with many domestic and international wind power organizations; and (c)
received good guidance. However, without the support from CRESP, CEPRI would still have
tried to acquire the required skills and equipment to conduct all tests needed for type certification,
but this may have taken longer and might have been less successful. WTC, by contrast, might not
have obtained CNAS accreditation, since it would have been difficult to purchase the required
equipment, obtain required training, and establish the required quality system.

CEPRI appreciated the support provided by the PMO and found that the step-by-step approach
was helpful. The support was, however, demanding in that it required a lot of documentation to

                                                 58
be provided. WTC mentioned that in addition to the financial support, it valued the international
technical communication and exchange and capacity building of its staff.

The subgrant for short-term wind power forecasting also used the WWTC subgrant facility. With
the support provided, CEPRI refined the short-term wind power forecasting system and applied it
to the Inner Mongolia power grid. The CRESP support was important for the financial resources
provided and for the guidance provided by the international experts. Without the support from
CRESP it would have been impossible to compare the results from CEPRI with the results from
reputable international short-term wind power forecasting systems. CEPRI would have preferred
to apply its tool to other gird systems than the Inner Mongolia grid system because of the
particular problems of Inner Mongolia, such as power restrictions.

Also for the establishment of the Inner Mongolia wind test base, the WWTC subgrant facility was
used, although this work was financed from the Inner Mongolia provincial budget. The Inner
Mongolia Test Power Company considered the most important aspect from the CRESP support
the technical advice and the financing. Through the CRESP support, a business plan has been
developed based on international best practices. This will be very helpful in operating the wind
test base. Although the financial support was relatively small, it was very important in the early
stage of the project. It reduced the business risk of the investor and increased confidence in the
project. Without the support from CRESP, the establishment of the wind test base would have
been postponed.

Wind Turbine Certification (WTCC)

For the CGC, the financial support from CRESP was most important. Through the financial
support from CRESP CGC had more exposure to cutting-edge technology through training and
exchange with international institutions, and could procure the required software and equipment.
Further, through the support from CRESP CGC had more cooperation with international
institutions and is now closer to mutual recognition of certification. Both certification bodies
agree that without the support from CRESP obtaining accreditation would have taken longer.
CGC recognized the flexibility the subgrant approach provided with respect to selecting partners
and contractors. To the question what CRESP should have done differently, CGC replied that
more attention could have been given to promote the certification by Chinese institutions outside
China, including developers, utilities, research institutions, banks, insurers, and other financial
institutions.

For the CCS, CRESP support made not a big difference. Without the support from CRESP, they
would very much have done the same, maybe at a little slower pace.

Biomass Technology Transfer (CGF-Biomass)

Four subgrant projects supported the development of biomass briquetting machines. These
projects provided a relative small support of US$40,000 to US$50,000. The financial support
from CRESP, although small, was important to these subgrant recipients. One of the respondents
mentioned that CRESP helped to complete the project early, and helped to improve the
companies’ reputation and credibility. One also mentioned that the financial support is important
because of the high risk of investment in quality improvement. It is not always possible to recover
the investment in quality improvement. These companies are relatively small. Therefore,
payments and a payment schedule are important. They mentioned that the first payment (30
percent) was fast (upon signing the subgrant agreement), but that the second payment was too
slow (upon proof of meeting milestones and proof that cost had been incurred). Improvements

                                                59
suggested (other than more money and bigger initial payment) include that coordination between
subgrant recipients should have been established.

CRESP also supported two research projects of the East China University of Science and
Technology. One project for the development of a gasifier and one project for catalytic cracking
of the gasifier tar. As CRESP provided the only source of funding, these projects could not have
been done without the support from CRESP.

The National Bio Energy Company stated that without the support from CRESP, the outputs
would have been the same (as the biomass industry needed the equipment developed), although
obtaining the outputs may have taken longer. The subgrant recipient did not like that
demonstration could not be included in the project.

Beijing Dahuajiva Small Town Investment Consulting Company received a subgrant to develop a
biomass gasification system for village power generation. Without the support from CRESP, this
project would not have taken place as a funding gap would have remained. The CRESP support
was only a small part of total funding needs.

The Jiangsu Huijia Environment Protection Development Company received a subgrant to
develop a wastewater treatment system for wastewater from scrubbing gasifier gas containing
tars. Because of the CRESP support, the project could be completed earlier.

Provincial Demonstration Projects (CGF-PDP)

The PMO received 11 responses from CGF-PDP subgrant recipients. From the responses, it is
clear that outreach received adequate attention. The outreach was done through site visits
(including local school students), reports, leaflets, presentations at workshops and conferences,
DVDs, a website, patents, and TV programs. Through this attention to outreach, a large number
of people know about these demonstration projects.

Replication of the demonstration projects is still limited. The Gaoyou 4 MW biomass gasifier for
power generation in Jiangsu is claimed to be replicated at Jiangsu’s Dongtai, Jurong, and Xuzhou
where five 6 MW biomass gasifiers for power generation will be installed. The PV water
pumping project in Inner Mongolia has been replicated at Inner Mongolia’s Xilingoler for 10
solar water pumping systems of 2 kW capacity for drinking water supply and five 20 kW capacity
systems for irrigation in Hohot’s Wuchuan County. All these systems are operational and
working well. The building integrated PV (BIPV) project at Guanya Power Equipment company
in Nanjing was replicated by the Tenghui BIPV project.

 The recipient of the subgrant for the Zhejiang biogas power project mentioned that if they had to
do the project again they would, among others, address the grid connection and tariff issue before
commencing with the project.

The additional projects under the provincial demonstration projects were to prepare renewable
energy investments in the pilot provinces and offshore wind projects. One of the 5 projects will
not be realized because of land acquisition problems in Inner Mongolia. The other projects will
very likely be realized. The Jiantiao 21 MW tidal power plant has been listed as Zhejiang
Province Key Project for 2011–15. The Zhejiang DRC approved the feasibility study. The
developer is waiting for approval of implementation. According to the respondents, it is (a) 100
percent certain that the 100 MW offshore wind farm in Fujian will be build; (b) 100 percent
certain that the 100 MW pilot offshore wind farm in Hangzhouwan in Zhejiang will be build (the

                                               60
wind farm has been listed on the offshore wind farm plan prepared by the local authority); and (c)
very likely that the 150 MQW intertidal wind farm in Rudong County in Jiangsu province will be
realized.

Other noteworthy comments are from Longyuan the developer of the 21 MW tidal power plant in
Zhejiang. Longyuan found in particular the midterm evaluation and the acceptance process (of
milestones reached) efficient. They would, however, have liked to reduce the cost for
international consultants.

Investor Scale-up Support Facility (ISSF)

Inner Mongolia North Longyuan Wind Power Company used the ISSF for the preparation of 4
additional wind farms. Of these, the Wuliji 49.5 MW phase 1 wind farm has been approved
(Wuliji is in total 300 MW) and the Huitengxile 24 MW wind farm is under construction. The
company expects that also the other two projects (Huitengliang 49.5 MW phase II project and
Wulate Qianqi 200 MW wind farm) and remaining phases of Wuliji will be approved.

The CRESP support was important, since it reduced the project preparation risk and provided
technical training and advanced international management experience. It also contributed to
standardization of project preparation procedures. This contributed to scaling up the companies’
involvement in renewable energy. The developer proposes to focus in CRESP Phase 2 more on
training of technical and management staff, in particular for improvement of existing wind farms.
Technical training is considered fundamental for the companies’ growth.

In Zhejiang the ISSF was used to prepare 8 SHP projects. Five of these projects are operational,
while the other three are under construction. The Zhejiang Hydropower Management Center
considers the ISSF support flexible and suitable for different projects. The conditions for
disbursement are clearly defined, and the process is well defined in the Project Implementation
Plan (PIP). It only considered that disbursement took too long. Recommendations for Phase 2
include focusing on improving the performance of existing projects, including the development of
new industry models, management, safety measures and restoring of environmental damage.

The response from Jiangsu Guoxin was, like all the others, very positive and specifically
acknowledged the help provided by the PMO.

PMO Staff Survey Results

PMO staff reduced from 16 at the start of CRESP to 5 at the end of CRESP. Two PMO staff
members were there from start to finish.

The PMO is of the opinion that CRESP Phase 1 was successful. The original goals of CRESP
Phase 1 were achieved, and the project had a significant impact on China’s renewable energy
industry and significantly accelerated its development. CRESP played an important pioneering
role in renewable energy. CRESP was involved in all of the most important milestones and
aspects of renewable energy development in China in recent years. This includes work on RE
policy studies, wind turbine technology transfer, wind turbine standards, testing and certification,
and long-term capacity building. This established a solid foundation for further development of
the renewable energy industry in China. Through this work, CRESP brought advanced
international concepts to China, most notably type certification.




                                                61
The PMO considers the national policy studies and technology improvement for wind had the
biggest and most important impacts in China. The provincial level activities are considered of
limited impact.

The main problem in implementing CRESP was the workload. One of the reasons for the
tremendous workload was the fragmentation of a large number of small contracts. Other reasons
included the limited capacity of some of the provincial implementation bodies. The PMO
highlighted that the subgrant system overall worked very well.

The PMO feels very proud of the financial management system established by the PMO. The
system developed and used by the PMO served as a best practice example for other World Bank
projects in China and abroad. The electronic version of the contract files is another major
achievement of the CRESP PMO that is well beyond what may be expected from an
implementing agency. This will serve as an example for other projects and may be developed
further for use in other projects.

If the PMO had to redesign CRESP Phase 1 again, the PMO would:

   •   Reduce the number of cost categories.
   •   Reduce the number of contracts.
   •   Only have a national program without pilot provinces.

World Bank supervision was helpful in the successful implementation of CRESP Phase 1, with
good supervision quality. However, supervision could have been more efficient by planning
supervision missions better.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The NEA, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the World Bank jointly organized a stakeholder
closing workshop at the end of CRESP Phase 1 to present achievements and share lessons learned.
The workshop was held in Beijing on December 15, 2011.

The workshop was well attended by more than 100 participants, including senior government
officials (including the Vice Minister of the NEA, two deputy Director Generals from the NEA, a
Director General from the MOF, senior officials from NPC’s Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Standardization Administration, and the
Certification and Accreditation Administration, government’s think tanks, and provincial
governments), project beneficiaries (including RE manufacturers, RE developers, research
institutes, academic), RE industry associations, the World Bank team, and other international
organizations (such as the UNDP, GTZ, and DANIDA). The closing workshop also presented
awards to selected project beneficiaries in recognition of the achievements and outcomes as a
result of CRESP support.

Both the NEA and MOF gave high marks to the significant contributions that the CRESP
program made to China’s renewable energy scale-up, and thanked the World Bank for its
assistance. The senior government officials reiterated that renewable energy is a high priority to
the government, and the fast-growing renewable energy development in China offers a good
opportunity for close international cooperation, taking advantage of the cutting-edge global best
practices with a focus on the most relevant renewable technologies, policies, and innovations in
China. They also told all the relevant parties to get ready for CRESP Phase II preparation and
implementation.

Senior officials from the NEA presented the overall achievements and lessons learned from
CRESP Phase I, demonstrating the strong government’s ownership of the CRESP program.
According to Chinese experts, CRESP Phase I has brought about over Y 9 billion investment in
China in the renewable energy related industries, with annual incremental production more than
Y 10 billion. The positive social, economic, and environmental benefits also include 3.5 billion
kWh electricity added from renewable sources and about 9 million tons of greenhouse gas
reduced for each year.

The participants highlighted the following achievements of the CRESP program:

    •   CRESP has strongly influenced RE policy development, RE Law and regulations in
        China, through supporting policy studies and technical assistance to help develop and
        implement the RE Law. The recommendations made in many policy studies supported by
        CRESP have been adopted by policy makers into laws and regulations. In particular,
        feed-in tariffs for power and biomass, important studies under CRESP, have been
        instrumental to scale up RE development in China;
    •   CRESP has played an essential role in rapid growth and quality improvement of the
        domestic wind, and to a less extend biomass, manufacturing industry, through supporting
        domestic manufacturers with cost-shared subgrants. Before the CRESP project started,
        Chinese wind manufacturers were facing difficulties producing megawatt-scale wind
        turbines and securing international quality certification. At the end of CRESP Phase I,
        four domestic wind manufacturers supported by the CRESP program have won Level A
        certification for their megawatt-scale wind turbine design, and in particular, Sewind has
        won type certification for its 2 MW wind turbine design from internationally recognized

                                               63
        wind turbine certification center. The program also supported the development of 8 wind
        turbine standards based on international standards, and establishment of the wind testing
        and certification centers in China. Today, China has four out of the top 10 wind
        manufacturers in the world. The quality improvements and cost reduction of Chinese
        wind manufacturing industry has benefitted China and the world.
    •   CRESP has contributed to large-scale RE investments by supporting 2 x 100 MW wind
        farms in Fujian and Inner Mongolia, a 25 MW biomass power plant in Jiangsu, and 16
        SHP plants with a total installed capacity of 24 MW. These investments are among the
        largest RE investments at the time. These projects substantially improved the capacity of
        RE developers. In particular, the 100 MW wind farm in Fujian set high standards of large
        scale wind farms in China and is considered as a best practice in the country. The project
        introduced and facilitated transfer of international best available technologies, improved
        quality and reduced costs of such plans, and set up cost benchmarks through international
        competitive bidding. The SHP projects in Zhejiang province enhanced technical and
        management capacity of local small and medium-size enterprises, increased their access
        to financing, and improved SHP technical design, environmental and social safeguard,
        and installed capacity at project sites. CRESP Phase I also assisted RE developers in
        identifying and preparing more than 1,000 MW of new RE investments through the
        support to the investors and supported the four pilot provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian,
        and Inner Mongolia) for demonstration of 24 renewable energy projects under the GEF
        grant.

The participants also discussed the following lessons learned:
   • The commitment to a long-term partnership between the government and World
        Bank/GEF is a critical success factor of CRESP Phase 1.
   • The conducive and effective RE policy framework is the driver for RE scale-up in China.
   • The cost shared subgrant approach worked very well and proved to be a cost-effective
        way to leverage the GEF grant and build true ownership.
   • Improving manufacturing quality is essential for the transition to a world-class
        manufacturing industry. The simultaneous support for technology development,
        improved standards, development of testing services and development of certification
        services produced outcomes far greater than support of any of these activities in isolation.
   • The piecemeal approach and fragmentation of policy study contracts resulted in lengthy
        delays and weakened policy impacts.
   • Supporting RE policies in pilot provinces has become irrelevant with the issuance of the
        RE Law.
   • For the investment projects the key lessons were as follows:
            o Focus should be on electricity generation (kWh) and not just installed capacity
                (kW).
            o Good quality, low cost, and high efficiency are essential for scale-up.
            o International competitive bidding helps get the best cost-to-quality ratio.
            o Allocating GEF resources for troubleshooting during implementation is of great
                help.
• A core project management team, with contributions from world-class international and
    Chinese experts is most cost effective.

The stakeholder workshop also had a lively discussion on the preliminary design and priorities for
CRESP Phase II, which will incorporate these lessons learned and many useful suggestions made
by the participants.

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The Borrower prepared a detailed Recipient Completion Report (Borrower ICR). The Recipient
Completion Report described project outputs and outcomes by theme, changes during
implementation, risks and sustainability, Borrower’s and Bank’s performance, and success factors,
and lessons learned. The Recipient Completion Report is summarized as follows:

Outcomes: The renewable energy policy studies have provided important inputs and
recommendations on improving China’s renewable energy regulations, development planning at
the national and provincial level, electric power pricing, quota system, and industrial policy. The
CRESP-supported policies studies led to the issuance of 9 supporting policies:
    • Preparation for the Energy Law;
    • Amendment of the RE Law;
    • Notice on Measures for Renewable Electricity Surcharge Subsidies and Quota Trade
        System from October 2007 to June 2008—Ordinance Code NDRC Price No. 3052
        (2008);
    • Interim Management Regulation on Subsidy for Energized Biomass, MOF Economic
         Construction No. 735 (2008);
    • MOF, Notice on Implementation Plan of Promoting Renewable Energy in Infrastructure,
         MOF Economic Construction No. 306 (2009);
    • Interim Management Regulations on Financial subsidy for Solar PV on Buildings. MOF
         Build No. 129 (2009);
    • MOF, MOST, and NEA Notice on Implementation for Golden Sun Project—Ordinance
         Code MOF Build No. 397 (2009);
    • NDRC Notice on Improved Price Policy for Grid-Connected Wind Power—Ordinance
         Code NDRC Price No. 1906 (2009); and
    • NEA, Notice on Recommendation for Green Energy County. NEA New Energy No. 343
         (2011).

The Borrower’s ICR highlighted the following policy impacts:
    •   Development of overall renewable energy development targets and technology
        development roadmaps to promote the sustainable development of the renewable
        energy industry in China.
    •   Gradual establishment of a suitable differentiated tariff system for renewable
        energy products to promote large-scale development of renewable energy.
    •   Development of a renewable energy development foundation to encourage a
        stable source of funding and investment mechanisms for renewable energy
        development.
    •   Development and promulgation of renewable portfolio approach to implement the
        RE Law and especially the power purchase of electricity generated from
        renewable energy.
    •   Improvement of incentive policies and regulatory measures for renewable energy
        industry development to facilitate healthy and rapid development of renewable
        energy industry in China.


                                                65
    •   Demonstration of the green energy county program to promote efficient
        renewable energy development and utilization in rural areas.

On the provincial level, 32 policies were supported, some of which have been adopted by local
governments, and the implementation measures for the RE Law have been issued in pilot
provinces and effectively implemented. With the support of CRESP, a solid basis has been laid
for the renewable energy scale-up development in Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian
Province, and Inner Mongolia.

The wind turbine technology transfer activities (WTTT) was successful in not only exceeding the
targets for the 5 participating wind turbine manufactures, but also progressively building up their
in-house design and engineering capabilities. Although all projects were considered successful,
the real winners will be those who can apply these capabilities to future technology development.
All the companies chose the same technology transfer route by developing partnerships with
European partners to improve design and engineering capabilities to bridge the knowledge gap
with international competitors. They applied the capabilities and knowledge gained through such
partnerships to design megawatt-scale wind turbines. The design capacity building has led to the
development of further turbines with longer blades and higher-rated capacities—a strong
indicator of the success and sustainability of the wind turbine technology transfer.

A similar development took place at Wafangdian Bearing Company. CRESP supported the
development of the main shaft bearing for the 3 MW from Sinovel. With the capabilities
developed, the bearing manufacturer can now develop main shaft bearing for other wind turbines
and is sufficiently confident to develop main shaft bearings for 3.6 and 5 MW wind turbines.

The Chinese wind sector has undoubtedly met the challenge. In a very short period, just three
years of this Technology Improvement Program, the manufacturers have moved forward
tremendously. The technology gap has been closed, and costs have certainly come down as
localization and competition has increased. There has been considerable capacity building with
much reduced dependence on overseas support in all areas.

The growing status and size of the Chinese turbine manufacturers is having a global impact.
Turbine prices have come down, in particular in new and developing markets such as Brazil.
Domestic manufacturers can offer their turbines at up to 30 percent lower cost than equivalent
imported machines. The Chinese offering has certainly influenced the market, directly through
sharpening prices and competition, but also through adding greatly to the global manufacturing
capacity.

In conclusion, CRESP Institutional Development and Capacity Building created a legal,
regulatory, and institutional environment conducive to large-scale, renewable-based electricity
generation. Renewable electricity capacity and electricity production has significantly been
increased, and the rate of increase is accelerating. China has established ambitious renewable
energy targets and is well on its way to meeting these targets. The renewable energy industry in
general and the wind industry in particular have gone through very rapid growth, and until
recently saw big industrial players entering the wind turbine manufacturing market to produce
large-scale wind turbines. The project objectives are fully achieved.

Indicators: CRESP reached or substantially surpassed the indicator targets established at
appraisal, except for the SO2 emissions reduction because of a dramatically reduced emission
factor as a result of large-scale deployment of flue gas desulphurization.


                                                66
Sustainability: The Borrower considers many of the achievements of CRESP Phase 1 sustainable.
The Borrower mentions in particular the wind turbine testing and certification centers, the long-
term capacity building training courses, and the provincial demonstration projects (in particular
the 5 MW fixed bed gasifier developed by Gaoyou and Aoke Ruifing). The Borrower also
believes that many of the projects for which CRESP supported project preparation will be
realized. In particular, the Zhejiang Jiantiao 21 MW tidal power plant and the 100 MW Fujian
offshore wind farm are mentioned in this respect. The sustainability is further expected to be
safeguarded by CRESP Phase II.

Borrower Performance: The Borrower is of the opinion that during operation of CRESP, the
PMO has functioned well. Comprehensive internal procedures have been developed and used.
The financial management was done very well. The PMO produced reports in line with World
Bank reporting requirements and summary reports for internal use and use by the World Bank
supervision team. Over the years, CRESP has been audited frequently. No problems were found.
In the most recent financial audit results, CRESP received the highest satisfaction rating from the
World Bank and the highest ranking by the National Audit Office. Out of the 49 World Bank
programs, 11 received top ranking appraisal, which include the CRESP. The PMO established a
contract management and filing system that can serve as example for other project within and
outside China.

The first phase CRESP has not only successfully introduced a verification mechanism for the
financial subgrants, but also achieved very good financial management performance, which is
highly appraised in a number of financial audits by China’s National Audit Office. CRESP PMO
played an incredible important role as a coordinator between the various departments of
Government of China and the World Bank.

World Bank Performance: The CRESP PMO has a very pleasant cooperation with the World
Bank. In addition to trainings in procurement and payment at the beginning of the program,
regular inspection and a supervision process also help capacity building progress in the PMO.
The success of CRESP phase I implementation owes much to the efforts of the World Bank.
Although the PMO is very grateful to all support provided by the World Bank, the PMO proposed
some changes for Phase II. These recommendations include the following:
    • Supervision can be less frequent, for example, 1–2 times a year. More frequent and long
        missions take too much time from the PMO’s normal project management tasks and
        reduce work efficiency. Adequate working time, combined with effective progress
        inspection, shall benefit the smooth implementation of the project.
    • Before each supervision mission, the World Bank should provide a detailed work
        schedule and requirements, so that the PMO can plan the supervision missions better and
        prepare the required inputs before the mission arrives.
    • World Bank staff should reserve more time for field visits instead of staying in Beijing
        too much. Field visits will increase understanding and will help to solve problems quickly.

Success Factors:
   • 2005 Renewable Energy Law. CRESP benefitted greatly from the quick passing of the
       RE Law in February 2005. The CRESP PAD envisaged enactment of the law in 2009.
       With the early enactment renewable energy, development proceeded much faster than
       anticipated.
   • Active Involvement of Renewable Energy Enterprises. Driven by national incentive
       policies, renewable energy industry is booming in China. Both public and private

                                                67
        investments have entered the field of renewable energy. A large number of Chinese
        institutes and companies have actively engaged in the renewable energy technology
        research and development, equipment manufacturing, and market penetration activities.
        Many renewable energy bases have been developed. Because of the support at
        government and corporate levels, new energy and renewable energy will lead a new
        round of energy industry growth.
    •   The Right Timing. Timing can be everything and it appears that the timing and vision of
        the Wind Technology Improvement Program was right. The Chinese wind industry is
        undoubtedly on a very steep learning curve, growing in size and in technology at a rate
        not seen elsewhere. And it has the advantage of an established global knowledge base. As
        an ever present theme, the Wind Technology Improvement Program aimed to benefit
        from this knowledge base by introducing overseas expertise to all the activities. It was its
        effectiveness in the bringing of expertise to bear across the full breadth of the sector,
        which stood out.
    •   Integrated Programmatic Approach. In demanding the level of quality dictated by the
        requirement for design approval, the turbine development also linked across to the work
        on standards and certification authorities. Without this joining together of the strands of
        manufacture with standards and skills capacity building, the result would have been
        greater risk and a slower pace of development. The CRESP program added value by
        addressing skills and capacity building across the wind sector. It introduced expertise at a
        critical period of rapid growth, reducing the chances of the Chinese industry suffering
        from avoidable mistakes.
    •   International Cooperation. With the strengthening of international cooperation in multiple
        formats, including international study tours, exchange workshops and seminars, concept
        and technology transfer, joint R&D, and international technical assistance, renewable
        energy technology gap between China and advanced countries are getting flat. In some
        areas, China owns more advanced technologies. Companies have improved their capacity
        because of the international exchanges, and they have gained experience and achieved
        fast growth. The international cooperation activities have effectively contributed to the
        smooth implementation of CRESP.

Lessons Learned:
   • Use flexibility in design and implementation. Some project activities planned were
       obsolete because of the very fast development of renewable energy in China. The PMO
       in consultation with the World Bank cancelled some activities and redesigned new ones.
       This flexibility is desirable.
   • Separation of national and provincial activities did not work well. The national and
       provincial level activities were difficult to coordinate. The national level activities were
       implemented under the coordination of the NEA; while the implementation of local-level
       projects was coordinated by the four pilot provincial Energy Bureaus. According to this
       model, the PMO has to establish two level teams to works with central and local
       government. Because various ideas and different goals, it was difficult for the PMO in
       project coordination and hence affected implementation quality of some projects. This
       complexity should be avoided.
   • Avoid fragmentation. CRESP Phase I had too many small activities. This increased
       workload, reduced focus, and led to suboptimal use of the outputs.
   • Avoid too much turnover of staff. The PMO staff moved frequently. In the CRESP
       project implementation, some project manager staff left for various reasons, for some
       posts staff members changed four times. This has affected the continuity of project

operation.
