INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE

PROPOSED LOAN
TO

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF IRELAND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $10 million to
The Industrial Credit Company, Limited (ICC).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's third in Ireland.  The
first loan (591-IRE) of US $14.5 million was made in March 1969 to the
Electricity Supply Board (ESB) to help finance the Turlough Hill Pumped
Storage Project. Performance under this loan has been satisfactory and
there are no outstanding problems. In March 1971, a second loan (726-IRE)
of US $20 million was also made to ESB to assist in the financing of a
250 MW extension at the Tarbert thermal power station.  This loan was
signed on March 3, 1971 and is expected to become effective soon.
3.        In 1969 the Government of Ireland requested the Bank to assist
ICC, an autonomous, Government-owned development finance company, since
it expects this institution to play an important and expanding role in
financing industrial development in Ireland. In August and November 1970
missions appraised ICC's position and prospects and concluded that its
past performance and the outlook for its future operations justified the
Bank lending. Negotiations with ICC and the Irish Government took place
in Washington in January 1971. The negotiators for the Borrower were led
by Mr. Frank Casey, General Manager of ICC; the negotiators for the
Guarantor were led by Mr. Sean Murray, Assistant Secretary, Department of
Finance.
4.        The following is a summary statement of the Bank loans to
Ireland as of March 31, 1971:

5.        The Bank is currently considering lending for an education
project and a third power project. Negotiations for the education project
are expected to take place in mid 1971; the power project is at present
being appraised. Ireland is member of IFC. IFC has not been active in
Ireland so far, and no projects are presently under active consideration.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
6.        Borrower:              The Industrial Credit Company, Limited
Guarantor:             Ireland
Amount:                The equivalent in various currencies of
US $10 million
Purpose:               To assist ICC in providing finance to
industrial enterprises for investment
projects in Ireland
Amortization:          In 19 years, including a two-year period
of grace, through semi-annual installments
beginning on May 15, 1973 and ending on
November 15, 1989. The Bank would from
time to time amend the amortization
schedule to conform substantially to the
aggregate of the amortization schedules
applicable to the sub-loans and investments
financed from the proceeds of the proposed
loan.
Interest Rate:         7 - 1/4 percent
Commitment Charge:     3/4 of 1 percent
PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        An appraisal report entitled "Ireland - Appraisal of The Industrial
Credit Company, Limited" (DB-75a) is attached.
8.        The economic growth of Ireland in the sixties was based on
the growth of manufacturing industry, which averaged about 7 percent a
year. This growth has been most marked in the industrial groups of
chemicals, clay products, glass and cement, and metal engineering, which
provided together about 60 percent of the increase in industrial employment.



Growth in output was heavily directed toward industrial exports which were
increasing at an average rate of 18 percent per year and the share of these
products in total exports rose from 30 percent in 1960 to nearly 50 percent
in 1970. Investment in manufacturing industry has almost doubled in the
past three years. This development was fostored by Ln active policy
by the Government to attract new industries and foreign enterprises to
Ireland and to provide through various channels capital resources necessary
for a sustained expansion of the industrial sector.
9.        ICC has established a position as the major institution in Ireland
providing long-term loan capital to Irish-owned enterprises. Its share of
the total manufacturing investment on a disbursement basis has averaged
about 6 percent in recent years. The other important institution assisting
industrial development is the Industrial Development Authority (IDA). It
was established by the Government in 1952, as part of a major change in
industrial promotion policy, to provide special incentives to attract new
export-oriented industries to Ireland. A policy of liberal grants to
industry has enabled it to achieve this objective. Together with the short-
term loans and overdraft facilities of the commercial and merchant banks,
IDA is meeting a significant portion of the initial capital requirements of
new large-scale, and mainly foreign, industrial enterprises. While ICC
also finances some of these firms, its main role in the recent past has
continued to be the financing of the expansion or modernization of existing
Irish firms.
10.       This industrial development strategy successfully established the
base for export-oriented manufacturing industries. Having achieved this
objective, the Government has reviewed its incentive policy and concluded
that incentive grants will now be administered more selectively. The new
policies are likely to increase ICC's scope for business since new industries
will become more dependent on term loans and equity finance as oppcsed to
grants. The proposed Bank loan would be the Bank's first to assist Ireland
directly in developing an internationally competitive industrial sector, an
objective of very high priority in its long term development program.
11.       ICC was incorporated in 1933 for the purpose of providing funds
to industry through a variety of forms of financing. It was given wide
powers enabling it to underwrite capital issues, to provide issuing house
facilities and to make permanent capital available to industry through
long- and medium-term loans and direct equity investment. Through its
underwriting and issuing house services it has played a role in the develop-
ment of the Irish capital market, although this market is still a small one.
It has shown considerable initiative in moving into new areas of activity
when the need has been identified. As a result, it has diversified into
hire purchase finance for industrial equipment, leasing of machinery,
finance for distributive trades, shipping finance (through a wholly owned
subsidiary, Shipping Finance Ltd.),and merger business. ICC is expected



- 4 -
by the Government to operate on commercial principles. The present
chairman, Dr. J. P. Beddy, is much respected in financial circles; under
his leadership the ICC Board and management have remained generally
independent of Government influence in the day-to-day management of the
company and in making investment decisions. The management and staff are
well qualified and experienced.
12.       ICCts resource position has been tight since 1968.   At October 31,
1970, it had resources of b 26.3 million ($63.1 million). Of this total
52 percent consisted of Government loans, 38 percent was share capital and
reserves and the balance was deposits or miscellaneous credits. ICC fore-
casts an increase of its annual loan and equity investment commitments
from L 8.6 million in FY 1969 (ending October 31) to ; 10.9 million in 1972.
Its commitments to manufacturing industry (excluding finance for shipping
and distributive trades) would increase from L 5.1 million in 1969 to
L 6.8 million in 1972. This increase would be in line with the projected
growth pattern in the Third Development Program (1969-1972) for fixed
investment in manufacturing industry, which is expected to rise from
L 75 million in 1969 to just over L 95 million in 1972.
13.       The implication of this forecast is that ICC will maintain its
current share of total manufacturing investment. This objective may be
difficult to attain, however, since ICC will have to make substantial
efforts to raise the financial resources required. Its commitments between
November 1970 and December 1972 would total about L 24 million. ICC has
estimated that receipts from loan repayments, retained earnings, portfolio
sales and the net increase of term deposits during this period is expected
to amount to about L 10.6 million.  The remaining gap of b 13.4 million
(or $32.3 million equivalent) would be covered by loans from the Government
of between L 3 and L 4 million annually, the proposed Bank loan of $10 mil-
lion (equivalent to L 4.2 million), and additional borrowing on the domestic
and foreign capital markets (including a recent medium-term borrowing of
about ; 500,000 equivalent in Switzerland).
14.       The proposed Bank loan of $10 million would be equivalent to
about 20 percent of ICC's total expected commitments in the next two years
and about 80 percent of ICC's foreign exchange requirements for industrial
term loans and equity investments; $1.5 million would be available to
finance non-private enterprises if needed. The Bank loan would be used
to finance direct foreign exchange expenditures of ICC s borrowers and the
foreign exchange component of domestically purchased imported items and
of construction costs, estimated at 70 percent and 35 percent, respectively.
Use of the loan will be limited to ICC's industrial term loans and equity
investment, which accounted for 41 percent and 18 percent, respectively
of its portfolio at the end of FY 1970. ICC's activities in hire-purchase
and leasing, which are short-term, in shipping loans, which are normally
made to non-Irish purchasers, and in loans to the distributive trade, will
not be financed by the loan.



15.       There are few large Irish enterprises and consequently the
majority of ICC's loans are relatively small. Loans up to $100,000 may
be made without the Bank's prior approval; in order to ensure adequate
supervision, the aggregate amount of such loans is limited to $3.5 million.
As a result, it is estimated that ICC would submit about 20 projects to the
Bank each year for approval. ICCis industrial term loans have maturity
periods ranging from 7 to 20 years. In recent years 15 percent of its loans
had terms of over 15 years. ICC may, on occasion, have projects in which
Bank funds are to be used, that require a 17-year repayment schedule and
this has been provided for in the Loan Agreement. The method of amortization
is that normally applied for loans to DFCs, i.e., the repayments to the
Bank will, in effect, be the composite of the individual sub-project
amortization schedules, with the restriction of a 17-year maximum noted above.
16.       ICC1s earning forecasts indicate that a substantial improvement
is expected over the relatively poor profitability performance measured by
its discounted annual return on net wqorth of less than 1 percent in the
past decade. The Company has been taking steps during the past three years
to write off losses and to make provisions to bring its portfolio into line
with its real worth, and has now substantially completed the necessary
revaluation. It is therefore in a good position to grow and to improve its
earnings performance. Profits after provisions and taxes are expected to
rise from about 4 percent to about 8 percent of average net worth duiring
the period 1971-75. ICC intends to keep the book value of its portfolio
in line with real worth by making conservative allowances for possible
losses annually. It is subject to normal taxation. ICC's debt-equity
ratio at the end of FY 1972 is expected to be about 1.8:1; indebtcdness
will be limited to three times its consolidated capital and surplus.
17.       Irish firms are generally reluctant to borrow on terms which
involve an exchange risk and the ICC will lend the proceeds of the
proposed loan in Irish pounds. Since this might involve the ICC in an
exchange risk, the Government has informed the ICC that it will adjust
the rate of interest on its advances to ICC to the extent necessary to
compensate ICC for any foreign exchange gain or loss it might encounter.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and The Industrial
Credit Company, Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Ireland and
the Bank; the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
19.       The provisions of the loan and guarantee agreements conform
substantially to similar agreements of the Bank for projects of this type.



PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ireland" (EMA-2), and an updating memorandum (EMA-23a), were distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 13, 1968 and on July 27, 1970,
respectively. A basic data sheet is annexed.
21.       After the adoption in 1958 of the First Program of Economic
Expansion and the implementation of outward-looking economic policies,
the Irish economy showed satisfactory growth. These policies were based
on industrial development geared to export markets and a system of grants
and tax incentives to attract foreign enterprises. The Anglo-Irish Free
Trade Agreement signed in 1965 provides for free trade with the United
Kingdom by 1975. Application for full membership in the EEC has also been
made. The Government has been implementing a policy of modernization and
reorganization of Irish industry to increase its competitiveness in the
enlarged market which may emerge. The full implications of membership,
however, are not yet clear.
22.       Since 1958 Ireland's GNP in real terms has grown at an average
annual rate of about 4 percent. Investment has been rising rapidly and its
ratio to GNP increased from 13 percent in 1958 to 22 percent in 1970.
Unemployment and emigration have been falling. Since the early sixties the
population has ceased to decline.
23.       Fluctuations during the process of expansion have created balance
of payments problems. A restrictive credit and budgetary policy restored
external equilibrium following the inflationary pressures of the mid-60's.
With relaxation of the policy in 1966 the economy regained momentum. The
rising level of economic activity and in particular the sharp increase in
investment, in public expenditure and in total credit created inflationary
pressures. These were intensified by the growth of wage incomes as the
labor unions secured large percentage increases in the annual "rounds" of
wage negotiations. Exports while increasing rapidly have been outpaced by
import growth and the balance of payments deficit on current account
increased from $53 million in 1968 to $166 million in 1969.
24.       The rate of economic expansion fell from about 4 percent in 1969
to 1.5 percent in 1970. The cement strike held back investment and output,
and the bank strike had also a dampening effect. Wage increases affected
the growth of profits adversely. There was also a slowdown in earnings
from tourism because of higher prices and the political trouble in Northern
Ireland. However, prices continued to rise fairly rapidly with consumer
prices showing an increase of about 8 percent. The balance of payments
deficit was $149 million, slightly less than in 1969.
25.       The Government reacted to this situation by stressing the need for
voluntary income restraint, and announced price controls as well as tax
increases and expenditure reduction in a supplementary budget. The full



impact of these measures cannot be gauged at present. They do, however,
indicate that the Government is firmly committed to reestablishing economic
stability in the interest of long-term growth. It now appears probable that
the pattern of development anticipated in the 1969-72 Program for Economic
Expansion will not be realized and that the growth of production will be
significantly loAer.
26.       The demand for foreign investment capital uill remain high despite
substantial efforts to raise domestic savings. Between 1960 and 1970 gross
national savi-ngs increased from 16 percent to an estimated 20 percent of
GNP. The total outstanding external public debt was $431 million on
December 31, 1970 and the debt service in 1970 is estimated at slightly
over 2 percent.
27.       In spite of its need for foreign capital for development and
its low debt service burden, Ireland has experienced difficulty in borrowing
abroad. The difficulty arose in part from the country's insufficiently
known credit standing and in part from the tight conditions which prevailed
in international markets during the second half of the sixties.  Nevertheless
Ireland has been increasingly successful in overcoming these difficulties
and securing a growing part of its needs from overseas financial markets.
Starting in 1966, eight issues totalling $145.6 million have been made on
external markets of which five were made since February 1969. Issues raised
in capital markets are not sufficient to meet requirements and I believe
that the Bank is justified in helping to bridge the gap. With an excellent
payment record and very small debt service, Ireland's creditworthiness is
not in question.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
