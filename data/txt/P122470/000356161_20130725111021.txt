This PRSC series of three annual single-tranche operations, delivered over FY10-12, was designed to
assist the Government of Mozambique (GoM) to implement key policy actions outlined in the 2006-
2010 Second Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA II by its
Portuguese acronym) and in the Performance Assessment Framework agreed by the Government and
the 19 external partners that provide general budget support (GBS) to GoM. Within this context, the
PRSCs focused on helping the GoM in:
(a) Macroeconomic management: to consolidate and deepen institutional reforms to improve the
    use of public resources through better budget formulation, stronger public financial management
    systems, stronger internal and external oversight, and civil service wage and pension reform; and
(b) Economic development: to continue to support broad-based growth by reducing the excessive
    regulation constraining business activities, improving the information basis for access to credit,
    simplifying the regulatory environment for business development and promoting more efficient
    land use and better access to land. Additional areas address reforms required for membership in
    the EITI, and strengthening the legal and institutional framework for PPPs and concessions.
In line with the government’s PARPA-II, and as reflected in the FY08-11 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), the program supported by this PRSC series recognizes the importance of
strengthening economic governance systems and supporting private sector development in order to
achieve broad based growth for poverty reduction. Specifically, this PRSC series supported
achievement of the following CPS outcomes: (#1) improved budget planning at central, district and
municipal level; (#2) improved government fiduciary systems; (#10) simplify procedures to start a
business; (#11) increased access to finance and support for SMEs.

Related operations of the World Bank Group were: Public Sector Reform Project (P072080);

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report covers the third
Poverty Reduction Support Credit series in Mozambique, consisting of three annual
single-tranche operations to be delivered over FY10-12. This PRSC series, included
PRSC 6-7-8, built upon the generally satisfactory progress achieved under the first and
second PRSC series.8 The latter, supported implementation of the country’s First and Second
Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty? (known as PARPA I and PARPA II, their
Portuguese acronyms) approved by Cabinet in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

2.      The PRSC 6-7-8 follow two previous series, PRSC 1-2 and PRSC 3-4-5 which
were discussed and rated by two previous ICRs. PRSC 1-2 supported the implementation
of the first PRSP (PARPA I) adopted in 2001 in the areas of public financial management and
public sector reform, and economic development. The ICR for PRSC 1-2 was rated
satisfactory on Outcome, Bank performance and Borrower performance. There was
concurrence by IEG. PRSC 3-4-5 supported the second PRSP (PARPA II) in areas of
macroeconomic management, public sector reform, and economic development (removing
constraints to growth and agricultural growth). The ICR for PRSC 3-4-5 rated the overall
outcome as satisfactory and both the Bank and the Borrower performance also as satisfactory.

3.     Mozambique had consistently been a strong performer, since the end of a
protracted civil war in 1992. In the fifteen years through 2008, the growth record had been
remarkable, averaging about eight percent annually, including in the three years prior to
launching the operations under review. This was due to solid growth across most sectors of
the economy such as agriculture, mining, electricity, water, tourism and financial services.
This performance was made possible by good macroeconomic management, the economy
responding positively to wide-ranging structural reforms, few significant foreign financed
investment projects (mega-projects), strong donor support and sizeable debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
arrangements.

4.       At PRSC-6 appraisal, while the medium-term macroeconomic outlook remained
positive, it was substantially clouded as a result of the global financial crisis . In this
regard, the government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections of real GDP
growth were revised downwards to 4.3 percent earlier in 2009 with a slight acceleration to 5
and 6 percent planned for 2010 and 2011, respectively. To address an unexpected fiscal gap
of about 2.5 percent of GDP the government rationalized recurrent and domestically financed
investment expenditures to generate savings of about 1.2 percent of GDP and sought
additional budget support. As agreed with the IMF, in the absence of higher budget support,
the government would borrow domestically to close the remaining gap. To complicate the
fiscal situation further, in August 2009, the government introduced a de facto subsidy to fuel
prices at the pump by preventing the pass through of international fuel prices to the domestic
market and promising the fuel retailers to reimburse them for the related losses in December
2009. To mitigate the adverse balance of payments (BOP) impact of the crisis and maintain a

high level of reserves, the government requested assistance under the IMF’s Exogenous
Shock Facility. The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), in light of the financial
crisis, confirmed that the country would continue to face a low risk of debt distress.

5.      During the post-civil war period, social indicators improved significantly. After
an initial significant decline, poverty reduction remained unchanged since 2003. The
country is well positioned to meet some Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) such as
universal primary education, gender equality and access to clean water in urban areas.
Encouraging progress was made towards other MDGs such as reducing child mortality and
improving maternal health. However, successfully combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other
diseases remain a challenge and chronic malnutrition rates increased from 2003 to 2008.
With regard to poverty, strong growth was accompanied by significant strides in reducing
poverty up to 2003. However, the results of the 2008/09 household survey suggest that
growth became less inclusive and the response of poverty reduction to economic growth
weakened after 2003. The poverty headcount ratio declined from 69 percent in 1996/97 to
55 percent in 2008/09 and poverty continued to be concentrated in the rural areas, and in the
center and northern part of the country. Overall, the country is unlikely to eradicate extreme
poverty and hunger by 2015.

6.      Mozambique has remained peaceful since 1992, but widespread poverty and
unemployment, at times, trigger social unrest. Since 1994, when the first democratic
elections took place, legislative and presidential elections have been held regularly. In
February 2008, street riots erupted in Maputo and two provinces following an attempted
increase in urban transport fares. At PRSC-6 appraisal, in September 2009, the country was
heading to the fourth round of presidential elections that were held on October 2009. The
incumbent President was reelected with 75 percent of the votes. International observers
indicated that elections were free and fair, but highlighted problems with electoral laws. In
the meantime, in September 2010, a few weeks before PRSC-7 appraisal, social unrest took
place again in urban areas triggered by rising bread, water and energy prices.

7.      Despite the country’s impressive progress, several key challenges remained. The
country continued poor with a GDP per capita of US$443 (2008), social indicators are low,
infrastructure is inadequate, the business environment remained unfriendly and constraints to
private sector development and trade remained substantial. Its productive base remained
narrow and focused on subsistence agriculture and a few isolated mega-projects and its
export basket remained limited with only twelve products registering annual exports in excess
of US$1 million. In addition, the budget relied heavily on foreign aid, which accounted for
almost half of its overall resource envelope, and progress in public sector governance was
mixed. In this regard, significant progress in strengthening public financial management
(PFM) systems was coupled with limited progress in implementing the Justice Sector and
Anti-Corruption reform agenda.

8.     This PRSC series was an important component of the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), discussed by the Board in 2007, to support PARPA II
implementation. The series also provided a transition from PARPA II to a new 2011-
2014 PRSP (Plano de Acção de Redução da Pobreza – PARP). The FY08-11 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS; Report No. 39395-Moz) supports the implementation of the




                                             13
PARPA II which implementation expired in 2010.9 As government policies and budget are
the main instruments for implementing the PARPA II, the Bank CPS committed to
supporting and aligning with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario of the CPS
envisaged programmatic support through consecutive PRSCs to support Mozambique’s
efforts in increasing accountability and public voice and fostering sustainable and broad-
based growth. In line with the government program, and as reflected in the CPS, the program
supported by the PRSC series recognized importance of strengthening economic governance
systems and the centrality of a broad-based growth agenda to accelerate private sector
development. The three operations being reviewed, bridged the transition to a new PRSP, the
2011-2014 PARP (Plano de Acção para a Redução da Pobreza), approved in May 2011,
which emphasizes the need to step up poverty reduction efforts by making economic growth
more inclusive. The Bank’s Board considered (i) the new PARP and a Joint IMF-IDA Staff
Advisory Note on January 10, 2012, and (ii) the new 2012-2014 CPS on April 13, 2012.

9.      The three operations being reviewed were fully harmonized with the
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) to support PARPA II implementation.
PARPA II was the instrument for operationalizing the 2005-2009 Five-Year Program, which
must be presented to Parliament by Government following elections. For the first time,
PARPA II included a strategic matrix of key indicators. The 2009-2011 PAF was part of the
new Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government and the representatives
of the nineteen (G19) external partners providing general budget support (GBS) to
Mozambique. 10 These PRSCs were fully aligned with and tracked progress based on PAF
indicators, all of which were anchored on PARPA II, and they disbursed against the upfront
completion of a subset of specific reforms identified in the PAF.

10.     The Bank and the IMF cooperated very closely within their respective mandates
in assisting the government to implement the PARPA II and the transition to the new
PARP. Mozambique had a stable relationship with the IMF, anchored on a three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) approved by the IMF’s Board in June 2007 and a one-year
Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) approved by the IMF’s Board in June 2009. The Bank
actively participates in the semi-annual PSI review missions and bi-annual Article IV
missions. Close collaboration in the preparation of the PRSC series was ensured through
Bank participation in IMF missions to monitor progress in the implementation of the
macroeconomic program and IMF participation in relevant G19 sector working groups and
the two joint annual reviews.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

11.   This PRSC series of three annual single-tranche operations, delivered over
FY10-12, was designed to assist the Government of Mozambique (GoM) to implement
key policy actions outlined in the 2006-2010 Second Action Plan for the Reduction of
Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA II by its Portuguese acronym) and in the
Performance Assessment Framework agreed by the Government and the 19 external

9
 The Segundo Plano de Acção para a Redução da Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA II) originally covered the period
2006-2009, but was extended to include 2010 to avoid a gap before the new Government would be able to
prepare the next PRSP document.
10
   The 19 donors are: African Development Bank, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, EU, Finland, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the World Bank. Two associate
members, the USA and United Nations, participate in the G19 policy dialogue, although they do not provide budget support.
In addition, the IMF is an ex-officio member of the G19.

                                                          14
partners that provide general budget support (GBS) to GoM. Within this context, the PRSCs
focused on helping the GoM in:

   a) Macroeconomic management: to consolidate and deepen institutional reforms to
      improve the use of public resources through better budget formulation, stronger public
      financial management systems, stronger internal and external oversight, and civil
      service wage and pension reform; and
   b) Economic development: to continue to support broad-based growth by reducing the
      excessive regulation constraining business activities, improving the information basis
      for access to credit, simplifying the regulatory environment for business development
      and promoting more efficient land use and better access to land. Additional areas
      address reforms required for membership in the EITI, and strengthening the legal and
      institutional framework for PPPs and concessions.

12.     In line with the government’s PARPA-II, and as reflected in the FY08-11
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the program supported by this PRSC series
recognized the importance of strengthening economic governance systems and
supporting private sector development in order to achieve broad based growth for
poverty reduction. The emphasis in macroeconomic management, including public financial
management, was linked to the long-term process of reforms that needed to be continued in
order to improve governance as well as supporting macroeconomic stability. The support on
economic development, including simplifying the regulatory environment for business
development and access to land, was seen as key to promote inclusive growth.

13.    Specifically, this PRSC series supported achievement of the following CPS
outcomes: (#1) improved budget planning at central, district and municipal level; (#2)
improved government fiduciary systems; (#10) simplify procedures to start a business; (#11)
increased access to finance and support for SMEs. Related operations of the World Bank
Group were: Public Sector Reform Project (P072080); Financial Sector Technical Assistance
Project (P086169); and the Competitiveness and Private Sector Development Project
(P106355).

14.     There were six prior actions for PRSC-6, seven prior actions for PRSC-7, and six
prior actions for PRSC-8. The PRSC-6 Program Document refers that reforms to improve
the business environment have been undertaken by the government but could not be reflected
in its prior actions because they were not reflected in the G19 PAF, adding that triggers
related to such reforms would start at PRSC-8.

15.     At PRSC-6, the impact of the PRSC supported program was measured against
the following set of outcome indicators:

      1 indicator on budget expenditure outturns;
      2 indicators on public procurement;
      1 indicator on wage policy;
      1 indicator on pensions reform;
      1 indicator on credit to the economy, and
      1 indicator on domestic investment.

1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

16.    The development objectives were not revised during the PRSC series. However,
at PRSC-7 and PRSC-8, indicative triggers and prior actions were revised, advanced or
dropped to reflect the country’s evolving conditions. Also, new triggers and prior actions
were added to (i) expand coverage of important areas of the government’s reform program
supported by the PRSC series, and (ii) more closely reflect the focus of the policy dialogue
between the Bank’s team with donors and the authorities. In section 2, more details are
provided about changes in triggers and prior actions that took place during the operations
being reviewed. All triggers were drawn from the G19 Performance Assessment Framework
(PAF) and/or the ‘Political and Economic Governance Reforms Matrix’ agreed by the
government and GBS donors in March 2010.

  Note: KI – Key Indicator


17.     Key indicators were also changed at the PRSC-7 stage. Five out of the ten final
key indicators remained unchanged over the course of the three operations under review. As
shown in Table 1 above, at the PRSC-7 stage, two indicators were dropped and five new
indicators were added to better track impact of reforms supported by this PRSC series. For
all new indicators, the baseline value and the end of the program target were established. All
indicators were also drawn from the PAF.




                                                                 17
1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

18.    The PRSCs under review supported a subset of reforms drawn from PARPA II
and its Strategic Policy Matrix contributing to: (i) strengthening the capacity, transparency
and accountability of state institutions by strengthening PFM systems both at central and
local level; and (ii) fostering a competitive and responsible private sector through
interventions aimed at improving the business environment and the investment climate.
Reforms were organized around two main components: (a) macroeconomic management, and
(b) economic development. Below is a brief summary of main policy areas covered in each of
those components, as spelled out in PRSC-6.

Macroeconomic management

19.    Under this component, this PRSC series supported reforms in the following
policy areas:

      Improve the budget process and the use of public resources: the objective of these
       reforms were to (i) strengthen the allocation of funds through the budget preparation
       and execution process, and (ii) support the government’s efforts of adopting a
       programmatic budget classification to allow better links between PARPA, MTEF, and
       budget allocations;
      Improve efficiency and effectiveness of PFM: government has completed the roll out
       of the integrated electronic PFM system (e-SISTAFE) to all ministries, at central and
       provincial level, and to a large number of autonomous agencies. The objective of this
       PRSC series was to support increasing the utilization of e-SISTAFE to manage
       Mozambique’s public finances, paving the way for improved PFM accountability,
       transparency, and efficiency;
      Make the State procurement system for goods and services transparent and efficient:
       following the introduction of a new procurement system that generally meets
       international standards of efficiency and accountability and operationalization of a
       new central procurement board (UFSA) in 2007, reforms in this area aimed at
       strengthening of the monitoring system to increase transparency and measure the
       effectiveness of the reforms;
      Increase coverage and efficiency of external audit bodies: reforms in this area
       continued to support increasing capacity of the external audit institution (Tribunal
       Administrativo - TA) to conduct audits and expand audit coverage to consolidate its
       role of independent watchdog of PFM;
      Improve human resources management in the public sector: building on the recent
       operationalization of an electronic database of all civil servants, the objective of these
       reforms were to (i) improve the management of the payroll and civil service human
       resources, and (ii) reform the pensions system to reshape and improve the quality of
       the civil service.


Economic Development

20.    Under this component, this PRSC series supported reforms in the following
policy areas:



                                              18
        Improve access to credit for private firms: reforms in this area focused on reducing
         information constraints for commercial banks by supporting improvements in
         accounting and reporting standards through the implementation of International
         Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the corporate sector;
        Strengthen the social security system: these reforms aimed at ensuring the financial
         sustainability of the social security system and adoption of best practice and
         transparency in the management of the social security funds to facilitate a deepening
         of the country’s financial sector;
        Improve the operation of the land law and facilitate access to land: the focus of these
         reforms was on implementation of the country’s generally sound land laws and
         regulations in view of gaps such as lack of clarity, limited capacity and unclear
         institutional arrangements, and low tax and associated distorted incentives for land
         access;
        Improve the business environment by simplifying the regulatory framework: this
         PRSC series focused on reforming one key aspect of the business environment,
         namely the excessive regulatory framework, with a view to support the government’s
         efforts aimed at sustaining high economic growth and reshaping its pattern to generate
         more employment by exploiting its vast and diversified export potential.

1.5. Revised Policy Areas:

21.     PRSC-7 introduced two modifications to the policy areas supported by this
PRSC series. First, under the component macroeconomic management, a new policy area
was added focused on increasing coverage and efficiency of internal audit bodies as this was
identified as a weak spot of the PFM system. In this regard, reforms aimed at strengthening
the internal audit institution (Inspecção Geral de Finanças – IGF) to improve both the
coverage and the quality of the internal control system. Second, under the component
economic development, a new policy area focused on maximizing the benefits from
megaprojects, concessions, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to reflect the country’s
growing potential wealth in mineral and other natural resources and the need to ensure their
adequate management. The objective of reforms in this new policy area was to support the
government’s effort to achieve membership of the EITI Initiative and to strengthen the legal
framework for PPPs and concessions.

1.6. Other significant changes:

22.   The Bank responded positively to assist the government to mitigate the adverse
impact of the international financial crisis. In this regard, PRSCs 6 and 8 were increased
to US$110 million from the original US$ 85 million envisaged in the FY08-11 CPS.



2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance:

23.    PRSCs 6 to 8 fully aligned with selected priorities of the Government’s PARPA
II and its Strategic Policy Matrix reform agenda and the PAF agreed by the GoM with
the G-19 development partners. The subsequent operations, generally, built on the
previous ones and the prior actions followed an incremental sequencing path to deepen the

                                               19
reforms. Performance with respect to prior actions and triggers is summarized in Table 2
below. This assessment takes as a starting point the prior actions and indicative triggers for
subsequent operations identified in PRSC-6 and how they evolved during the PRSC series in
terms of being dropped, advanced or new actions being added. Changes in some of the
reforms envisioned at the beginning of the series are the result of changing government
priorities as well as the intrinsic difficulties posed by the inflexibility of the PAF.

24.    All prior actions were completed before Board approval. Flexibility was adopted
in the PRSC series to respond to the country’s specific circumstances. At PRSC-6, 6
prior actions (5 under macroeconomic management and 1 under economic development)
were met and another 13 indicative triggers were identified, of which 4 triggers (all under
macroeconomic management) for PRSC-7 and 9 triggers (5 under macroeconomic
management and 4 under economic development) for PRSC-8. At that stage, the Program
Document mentioned (para. 108) that (i) in each of the following operations there would be
no more than 6 to 8 triggers; and (ii) the Bank was continuing to work with government and
development partners to reflect in the PAF key reforms to boost economic growth so that
they could be used as prior actions of subsequent operations. The latter, seems to have been
one of the contributing factors to changes in prior actions that took place in follow-up
operations, especially during PRSC-7.

25.     Overall, the operations being reviewed proceeded well. In some areas progress
was very significant. In PFM, the 2010 PEFA assessment reported continued progress
towards meeting good PFM practices with the share of indicators scoring B or above moving
from 36 percent in 2006, to 50 percent in 2008 and 54 in 2010 (Annex 6). In the EITI,
Mozambique was declared fully compliant with the EITI requirements in October 2012. In
several areas, such as human resource (HR) management in the public sector, IFRS
implementation and improving the business environment, encouraging progress was
achieved. In areas such as strengthening the budget process progress was modest while in
procurement, land taxation, INSS and pension reforms preparatory activities were still being
carried out and progress was limited.

26.     From 2008 to 2011, progress in implementing PAF actions was considered
satisfactory paving the way for budget support disbursements to proceed, except for
2010 when it was considered broadly satisfactory. The Government and the G-19 jointly
reviewed progress on PAF implementation, every year (Table 3 below). As stated in the
FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report ?donor dialogue reached an
impasse in early 2010 in the context of Mozambique’s General Elections, when multilateral
positions differed significantly from the ones brought forward by bilateral donors with regard
to demanding political change.? Donors’ concerns on matters of political and economic
governance led to a delay of budget support disbursements by most donors early in 2010.
After government committed to measures to address those concerns (listed in a “Political and
Governance Policy Matrix?) in March 2010, disbursements resumed in April 2010.

27.     During the period under review, the PAF component that delivered a consistent
solid performance was the one focused on macroeconomic and PFM issues. The table
above summarizes, by component, main Annual Joint Review findings with regard to
achievement of the set of annual indicators agreed in the PAF. Globally, the share of
indicators met or not met but with significant progress has declined from 87.5 percent in 2008
to 74.3 percent in 2011.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

28.    A number of factors contributed to positive progress achieved in the
implementation and outcome of this PRSC series. These include: (i) adequacy of
government’s ownership, (ii) soundness of background analysis, (iii) assessment of the
operation’s design, and (iv) risks identified at appraisal stage and effectiveness of mitigation
measures.

29.     Adequacy of Government’s ownership: The government had strong ownership of the
program supported by the PRSCs 6 to 8. These operations (i) were well aligned with the
Government’s PARPA II - which was prepared in a participatory manner and strongly led by
the Government - and were appropriately responsive to the borrower’s evolving conditions
and country development priorities; (ii) identified prior actions and outcome indicators drawn
from the PARPA II strategic matrix and related PAF agreed with the G19 GBS partners
and/or the ‘Political and Economic Governance Reforms Matrix’ agreed by the government
and G19 in March 2010; and (iii) anchored their supervision on the Government-led Joint
Annual Reviews of implementation of PARPA II and associated PAF matrix, which were
timed to align with the authorities’ policy review and budget processes. The government was
in control of the pace of implementation of the reform agenda. The government’s timely
corrective measures to address the adverse impact of the global economic downturn
demonstrated firm commitment to macroeconomic stability. Similarly, a pro-active stance

                                                     23
led to significant progress in the PFM/EITI reform agenda. Delays in completing studies or
technical assistance work slowed program implementation in some areas (e.g. procurement
MIS, pensions reform, INSS, land taxation) possibly reflecting weak capacity and/or the fact
that government needed more time to build consensus. In hindsight, PRSC-6 seems to have
been too optimistic with respect to the authorities’ readiness to significantly advance reforms
in the last four areas. In these cases, the PRSCs generally adjusted to the government's
implementation and consensus-building capacity. In the context of preparation of this PRSC
series, the World Bank also held two meetings with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), in
March and September 2009, to discuss the preparation and focus of the new PRSC series in
the context of the G19 framework. Finally, monitoring of reform implementation has been
open to participation from the public and representatives of CSOs through the work of the
Development Observatories and their participation in the two annual PAF reviews conducted
jointly by the GoM and G19.

30.     Soundness of background analysis: The analytical basis for the PRSCs was sound.
The design of the operations under review has appropriately drawn on extensive country
analytical work. The country’s macroeconomic performance and policies had been assessed
in the context of joint IMF-Bank missions undertaken prior to the preparation of each
operation. Also, DSAs were carried out jointly with the IMF in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The
2006 and 2008 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) reports, the findings
of the IMF technical assistance missions on progress of PFM reforms in January 2008 and
March 2009, a G19 PFM Quality Assurance Group mission in March 2009, and the Country
Procurement Assessment Reviews (CPAR) of 2001 and 2008 informed the PFM reforms.
The 2010 PEFA report informed the PRSC-8 preparation. The Country Economic
Memorandums of 2005 and 2009, Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and Financial
Sector Assessment (FSA) of 2009, a Poverty Assessment completed in 2007 and a Policy
Note on the impact and policy options to respond to the higher food and fuel prices
completed in 2008 informed the economic development reforms. Finally, the High-Level
Policy Conference on Medium-Term Priorities hosted by the Government, in March, 2010
and jointly undertaken with the IMF, United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation stands out as
a high-quality knowledge sharing and policy dialogue initiative.

31.     Assessment of the operation’s design: The FY08-11 Bank’s CPS supported the
implementation of the Government’s PARPA II and stated that the third PRSC series would
support the country’s efforts to increase accountability and public voice and foster sustainable
and broad based growth. Accordingly, the third PRSC series focused on a subset of areas
identified in the PAF, while reforms on social sectors were not part of the program because
support and policy dialogue were carried out through other financing mechanisms. To
address institutional capacity gaps in areas supported by these PRSCs, the Bank’s Public
Sector Reform Project, Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project and the
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development Project, as well as other donors’ capacity
building initiatives, provided critical support in advancing the reform agenda (e.g. e-
SISTAFE, e-Folha, IFRS, elimination of unnecessary regulation). This PRSC series was also
well aligned with the Bank’s “Good Practice Principles for Conditionality?, namely (i)
reinforce ownership; (ii) strengthen harmonization; (iii) customize program to country
circumstances; (iv) select only critical actions; and (v) ensure transparency and predictability
of process. Finally, lessons learned by the Bank from previous PRSCs were usefully
incorporated into these operations‘ design, including the importance of (a) government
ownership, (b) harmonization with other development partners, (c) capacity building

                                              24
initiatives to support the reform program, and (d) good analytical work to encompass the
political economy of reforms.

32.      The design of the operations under review reflected constraints imposed on the
PRSCs from the commendable decision to align with the PAF agreed by the
Government and the G19 GBS partners to enable PARPA II implementation. While
acknowledging the substantial benefits the G19 system has brought in terms of streamlining
the donor dialogue with the Government, the PRSCs candidly stressed the challenges
imposed by the PAF framework (i) limited flexibility in the process to select and update PAF
indicators to better respond to changing conditions, (ii) insufficient balance in the PAF
between outcome indicators and policy actions due to bias towards the former, somewhat at
odds with the Bank’s Board-approved policy for development policy operations (OP/BP
8.60), and (iii) excessive fragmentation of the policy dialogue due to the unnecessary large
number (72) of working groups. In fact, at PRSC-6, those PAF constraints contributed to
back-loading triggers in the area of economic development to the 3rd operation in the series
and, possibly, led to several changes in Prior Actions as subsequent operations attempted to
address the issue. According to PRSC-8, progress has been made in tackling those
constraints as (a) the new PARP allows the Government to adjust priorities and targets in
light of changing economic and social conditions and international developments which will
facilitate the adoption of more dynamic development policy operations, (b) the PAF 2012-14
indicators include policy and institutional measures that are needed to make progress in
sectoral outcome indicators, and (c) the working group structure has been streamlined to a
smaller number (25).

33.     Risks identified at appraisal stage and effectiveness of mitigation measures: Three
sets of risks were identified during the appraisal of the operations and mitigating measures
were proposed. They related to the potential for adverse impact on the implementation of the
government’s reform program from: (i) macroeconomic shocks, (ii) political factors and
governance, and (iii) capacity constraints. Risks were well identified and the anticipated
mitigating factors have broadly worked, as indicated below:

      Macroeconomic shocks: they did materialize and impacted, either adversely or
       favorably according to fluctuations of international prices of aluminum, oil and
       grains, and the country’s traditional exports. The financial crisis has also reportedly
       led to the postponement and/or cancellation of some foreign direct investment. In
       spite of growth slowing down to 6.3 percent in 2009 before accelerating again in the
       following years, the country coped well with the global economic downturn. The
       coming on stream of two large coalmines was a mitigating factor. More importantly,
       the Government repeatedly addressed external shocks with timely and flexible policy
       responses including by seeking IMF resources to maintain prudent levels of foreign
       reserves while keeping a flexible foreign exchange regime. As anticipated in the
       PRSCs, a continued stable relationship with the IMF was key and the PSI-supported
       program remained on track throughout the third PRSC series.

      Political factors and governance: the risk did materialize. Following the late 2009
       General Elections, bilateral donors’ concerns on matters of political and economic
       governance led an impasse in dialogue and led to delays in GBS disbursement. As
       expected, intense dialogue and government commitment to measures to address
       donor’s concerns were mitigating factors although the generally slow pace in
       improving governance led to a decline in donor support in 2012. Also, in September

                                             25
       2010, a few weeks before PRSC-7 appraisal, street riots took place in urban areas
       triggered by rising energy, water and bread prices. More progressive price
       adjustments on the latter helped to restore tranquility. As for the slow pace of some
       reforms anticipated at PRSC-6, particularly in procurement, land taxation, pensions,
       and INSS, the impact of greater staff engagement in supporting reform preparation
       and government’s actions to build consensus have probably fallen short of initial
       expectations. Limited progress was made in these four areas. A better understanding
       of how political and other factors play out on these reforms is required, if progress is
       to be achieved in the near future.

      Capacity constraints: This risk included both lack of high technical skills in some
       areas and lack of human resource in other areas to implement the reform program.
       The broadly successful mitigation of this risk, as anticipated, involved both the Bank
       and other development partners making available significant technical assistance
       targeted at reform areas supported by the PAF (para. 29).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

34.     M&E Design: the indicators and triggers/prior actions for the third PRSC series
were aligned with a subset of the PARPA II Strategic Matrix which is part of the 2009-
2011 PAF jointly prepared by the Government and G19 partners active on GBS. This
ensured consistency with the Government’s M&E framework and alignment with the
harmonized approach defined among the G19 donors involved in budget support. The PRSC-
6 Policy Matrix and Results Framework broadly spells out the linkages between policy
actions and expected outcomes for each of the two main policy components supported by this
PRSC series. However, in some cases (e.g internal and external audit, MTPP) such linkages
could have been better formulated, as they were redundant by restating the prior action as the
outcome. The results framework identifies baselines and end of the program targets for key
outcomes.

35.     Looking forward, to assist the government in strengthening the overall
monitoring and evaluation framework for the new PARP an Institutional Development
Fund (IDF) grant was approved in 2009. The Ministry of Planning and Development
commissioned a study (USEC 2008) to better understand factors preventing the functioning
of the national M&E system. Activities under the IDF grant picked up on the USEC analysis
and targeted specific areas, including: (i) improving the results orientation at sector level by
strengthening the logical linkage between different levels of results and relating them to
budget and policy actions as well as provincial plans; and (ii) improving the linkage between
M&E and planning, by strengthening the coordination mechanism and production cycle of
the annual PARP progress report.

36.     M&E Implementation: The Bank’s supervision of the PRSCs was aligned with
the two joint annual reviews conducted by the GoM and the G19 GBS donors. The first
joint review usually takes place around April and is mostly backward-looking evaluating
progress achieved in the previous year. The second review, usually around September, is
mostly forward-looking focusing on the following year performance indicators. The PRSCs
supervision was also carried out on a continuous basis, through the monthly joint
government-donor steering committee meetings. Progress in each sector was monitored by
joint government-donor sector working groups. Bank staff actively participated in these
meetings through its staff in the field office and Washington D.C. (through missions or by

                                              26
videoconference). Furthermore, the Bank participated in IMF missions to monitor progress
in the macroeconomic framework. Monitoring of the PARPA II in the various sectoral
working groups was carried out on the basis of its ‘Strategic Matrix’.

37.     M&E Utilization: The Program defined in the PAF was implemented through
Government systems with monitoring and evaluation reported in the Government's annual
Economic and Social Plan (Plano Económico e Social - PES) and the annual State Budget
(Orçamento de Estado - OE) that are submitted to the Parliament for approval. Progress
under PES was monitored by the Parliament through the annual Review of the Economic and
Social Plan (Balanço do Plano Económico e Social – BdPES). Despite progress achieved, as
mentioned in the May 2012 Aide Memoire of the Joint Review, comprehensive PARPA
reporting into the BdPES remains an objective to be achieved in the near future. Progress in
PAF implementation was assessed as planned in the MoU. While the Directorate of M&E at
the Ministry of Planning and Development continues to build its capacity, it could not meet
the numerous demands associated with the timely publication and dissemination of data for
the assessment of key policies and interventions spelled out in PARPA II. Poverty
monitoring continued to be the responsibility of the National Statistics Institute (INE), which
conducted a household survey in 2008/09. Further progress is required to improve INE’s
data quality and analytical capacity.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

38.      PRSCs 6 to 8 are being followed by a fourth series of Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs 9-11) to be delivered annually during FY13-15. The new series will
support implementation of the Government’s third Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (Plano
de Acção para Redução da Pobreza – PARP) for 2011-2014, discussed by the Board on
January 12, 2012. In line with the government’s PARP and the FY12-14 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), the objective of the PRSC series is to assist the Government of Mozambique
to: (i) to improve the business climate and to increase transparency in extractive industries;
(ii) strengthen social protection; and (iii) strengthen public financial management by
enhancing effectiveness of internal audit, developing a public investment management
process, and improve public debt management. The reform policies supported by this new
series will be embedded in and aligned with the 2012-2014 PAF.

3.   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:
Rating for relevance of Objectives: Highly Satisfactory
Rating for relevance of Design: Satisfactory
Rating for relevance of Implementation: Satisfactory

39.    Overall, the relevance of the program is rated satisfactory. The program
supported by the third PRSC series was and remains highly relevant to the country’s
development priorities and the Bank’s corporate goals. This reflects adequate diagnosis of
development priorities that remain relevant at the time of the ICR for the third PRSC series.
The program was flexible, responded to the needs of the client in the context of a challenging
external environment, bridged well the transition to a new PRSP, was consistent with the
Bank’s corporate agenda, including encouraging donor harmonization.



                                              27
40.     Objectives: The objectives spelled out in this PRSCs series were and remain
highly relevant to the country’s development priorities and context. The operations were
well aligned with the government’s poverty reduction strategy (PARPA II) and its Strategic
Matrix and the FY08-11 CPS that supported its implementation. Also, the PRSCs bridged
well the transition to the new Poverty Reduction Action Plan (known as PARP) for 2011-
2014 approved by Cabinet in May 2011. Bank and Fund staff prepared a Joint Staff
Advisory Note on the new PARP, which was discussed by the Board on January 10, 2012.
PARP does not depart significantly from the previous strategy supported by this PRSC series,
although it sharpens its focus towards boosting productivity in labor-intensive sectors and
unleashing the structural transformation and diversification of the economy. The new PARP
has been complemented by a strategic matrix of key indicators that laid the foundation for the
new PAF 2012-14, agreed between the Government and the G19 development partners. The
new PAF informed preparation of PRSC-8.

41.     Design: The design of the operations being reviewed was consistent with the
program’s objectives and such design remains relevant in the current context. It was
consistent with promoting the Bank’s corporate agenda defined in the FY08-11 Country
Partnership Strategy and achievement of four CPS outcomes: improved budget planning at
central, district and municipal level; improved government fiduciary systems; simplify
procedures to start a business; and increased access to finance and support for SMEs.
Commendably, the operations were framed as part of a concerted multi-donor effort, and they
were fully harmonized with the PAF drawn from PARPA II and agreed between the
Government and the nineteen GBS development partners. All the PRSC prior actions and
monitoring indicators were drawn from the PARPA Strategic Matrix and related PAF. Initial
shortcomings in the PRSCs design (e.g. need to better reflect reforms to boost economic
growth), mostly related to constraints imposed by the agreed G19 MOU and related PAF,
were dealt with later in the series with measures being added to (i) improve the business
environment, (ii) support progress towards full compliance with EITI requirements, and (iii)
enacting the PPPs, large scale projects and business concessions law. As noted in Table 2,
seven triggers were dropped during implementation. One, because it was not considered
relevant (INSS). Another four, because reforms were still at different stages of being
prepared (pensions reform, land taxation reform, public procurement), what suggests some
weakness in the design of the program supported by the series. Another two (MTEF) were
dropped to be responsive to the country’s changing circumstances.

42.     Implementation: Flexibility was adequately introduced in the program and the
program’s focus was on progress towards the development objectives. The PRSCs being
reviewed, in general, contributed to the achievement of satisfactory results and provided a
predictable flow of resources from the Bank. Whenever changes in the indicative triggers to
firm up prior actions were justified by the need to address short-term challenges, it was
ensured that these changes would not modify the thematic content of the PRSC and continued
to be fully consistent with the series development objectives. Also, the amounts of PRSC 6
and 8 were adjusted upwards to assist the country to address a challenging external
environment and maintain a stable macroeconomic environment. Moreover, by sticking to
the G19 framework the PRSCs were able to effectively continue to play a key role in the
coordination and influence the evolving architecture of significant multi-donor budget
support being granted to the country. Finally, the Bank, IMF and other donors technical
assistance helped the authorities to build up their capacity and meet the challenges posed by
the reform agenda (e.g. PFM, EITI).


                                             28
3.2 Achievement of PDO:

Achievement of the PDO: Satisfactory.

43.     On balance, satisfactory progress was achieved in meeting the objectives of the
reform program supported by this PRSC series. During the period covered by the
operations being reviewed, skillful government response to the adverse global economic
environment contributed to maintaining the excellent economic growth record during the
previous decade and macroeconomic performance was solid throughout the program.
Moreover, impressive progress was made in the consolidation of important reforms such as
the stabilization and expansion of the use of the e-SISTAFE system, deepening the role of
external scrutiny of the budget, as well as establishing a framework for increased
transparency and accountability in use of public resources, including achieving full
compliance with the EITI requirements. The latter is especially timely as Mozambique is at
the cusp of becoming a world-class destination for mining and gas. At the same time,
encouraging progress was achieved in areas such as increasing coverage of internal audits,
improving human resource management of civil service, IFRS implementation and improving
the business environment. While modest progress was achieved in reforms aimed at
strengthening the budget process, areas such as public procurement, land taxation, pension
and INSS reforms continue to pose a challenge.

44.     During the third PRSC series, the country maintained its strong track record of
prudent macroeconomic management. While the PRSCs did not specify as a development
objective maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, provision of budget support
by the World Bank typically requires that (i) the macroeconomic framework be considered
adequate for growth and poverty reduction, and (ii) an IMF-supported program remained on
track. In this regard, the three-year PSI approved in June 2007 was successfully completed in
June 2010, with reviews completed on time and with minor waivers. Also, to cushion the
country from the effects of the global economic crisis, access to resources under the IMF ESF
was approved late in June 2009. The second and final review of the ESF was also timely
completed in June 2010, with a waiver granted for the non-observance of the end-December
2009 ceiling on reserve money. A second PSI was approved in June 2010, program
implementation has been satisfactory and the latest review was successfully completed in
December 2012.

45.     From 2009 to 2012, economic growth remained vigorous although it slowed down
during the global food, fuel and financial crisis and associated global economic
slowdown (Table 4 above). While the country’s real GDP growth rate slackened to 6.3
percent in 2009, it recovered to 7.1 and 7.3 percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively, and an
estimated 7.4 percent in 2012. The country’s growth record remained one of the strongest in
the region, outpacing not only the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) average, but also that of the
other so called “frontier economies?. 14 Mozambique’s resilience largely reflects the
government’s rapid and flexible policy responses to evolving challenges, including corrective
measures to rationalize expenditures for non-priority sectors, and monetary policy aimed at
limiting the impact of the higher public debt on credit to the private sector. With the
improved economic outlook and growth back on a sound footing, the government tightened
macroeconomic policies and, in 2010, started unwinding the policy easing adopted during the
global economic downturn to address the double-digit inflation registered during that year.
Annual average inflation in 2011 fell to 10.4 percent and an estimated 2.1 percent in 2012.
On the fiscal front, strong domestic revenue performance (increased from 17.6 percent of
GDP in 2009 to an estimated 23.8 percent of GDP in 2012) coupled with prudent public
expenditure management led to a declining domestic primary deficit, before grants, which
contracted from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated -2.3 percent and -0.9 percent of
GDP in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Over the same period, the impact of the fuel-subsidy
regime has been progressively diminished and its overall cost fell from 1.5 percent of GDP in
2010 to 0.6 percent for 2012. Moreover, the share of aid in the national budget has been
decreasing, and external grants now account for approximately 23 percent of total
government spending.

Component I - Macroeconomic management

Improving the budget process and the use of public resources: Moderately Satisfactory
Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of PFM system: Satisfactory
Making the State procurement system transparent and efficient: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Increasing coverage and efficiency of internal audit bodies: Satisfactory
Increasing coverage and efficiency of external audits: Satisfactory
Improving human resources management in the public sector: Satisfactory

Overall achievement: Satisfactory

46.     Progress on improving the budget process and the use of public resources was
moderately satisfactory. The annual budget continued to be prepared in an orderly and
participatory manner, as demonstrated by keeping a B+ score of the relevant 2010 PEFA
indicator (PI-11). As far as the multi-year perspective of fiscal planning, the 2007-09 MTEF

14
 Frontier economies typically refer to low-income SSA countries undergoing high growth: Angola, Ghana, Kenya,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

                                                         30
was submitted for Cabinet approval for the first time and its implementation was supported
by PRSC-6. However, there are still a number of weaknesses associated with the MTEF
instrument. This is reflected in the unchanged score at C+ of the relevant 2010 PEFA
indicator (PI-12), as no significant improvements took place in the (a) multi-year fiscal
forecasts and functional allocations, (b) existence of costed sector strategies, and (c) linkages
between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates. The recent PEFA
assessment while recognizing that at the aggregate level, there is a reasonable alignment
between the MTEF and the Budget for the first year, also reports that (i) in general, MTEFs
were not adopted within a timeframe that would make them useful for the Budget preparation
process, and (ii) significant discrepancies between the MTEF and the Budget for the outer
years due to inadequate data on externally-financed projects and inflation assumptions. Since
2009, program budgeting has been extended to the full budget and with donor support the
government has been exploring how to move forward in a manner that suits the country
conditions. By mid-2013, the Government plans to have completed the mapping of priority
spending to the PARP pillars, using a detailed classification by spending programs so as to
use it for the Budget 2014. In the near future, considerably reducing the variance between
expenditure out-turns and initially approved budgets across administrative budget heads (PI-2
score D) will be key to strengthening the MTEF process.

47.     Progress on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of PFM system has been
satisfactory. Building on good progress during previous PRSCs, this PRSC series supported
increasing the utilization of e-SISTAFE in the direct budget execution with a view to reduce
the variance between primary expenditure out-turns and the originally approved budget.15
The direct budget execution represented 37.5 percent of the State Budget in 2010 and was
expanded to 42.2 percent in 2011. The 2010 PEFA assessment confirms that the reduction of
the variance envisaged in this PRSC series was met and exceeded (PI-1 was upgraded from B
to A) and underscores that the expanded use of e-SISTAFE was a main contributing factor.
The expanded use of e-SISTAFE is also mentioned as contributing to reducing the extent of
unreported government operations (PI-7 score up from C to B), and to more effective internal
controls for non-salary expenditure (PI-20 up from B to B+). The assessment also
acknowledges the positive impact of e-SISTAFE on assessing the stock and monitoring of
expenditure payment arrears (PI-4), and facilitating timeliness and regularity of accounts
reconciliation (PI-22), even if the related scores remained unchanged. The PRSCs also report
that implementation of the e-SISTAFE reform contributed to progress on the ability of the
authorities to obtain reliable, timely and relevant data on budget execution and predictability
in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures by budget holders. Overall, the
2010 PEFA reports continued good progress towards meeting good PFM practices, with the
share of indicators scoring B or above moving from 36 percent in 2006, to 50 percent in 2008
and 54 in 2010 (Annex 6). However, significant challenges remain in utilizing the new PFM
rules and systems toward improving day-to-day practices at sector, provincial and district
levels. A deeper analysis of PEFA indicators, and a number of their sub-dimensions, show
that firm action is necessary to address issues such as high variance between expenditure out-
turns and initially approved budgets across administrative budget heads, monitoring of
aggregate fiscal risk, limited availability of information on resources received by front line
service delivery units, follow-up actions by management on the findings of external scrutiny.
Also, manually operated processes reportedly coexist with electronic technology and while
automated financial reporting capabilities and internal oversight entities exist throughout
15
   Direct budget execution of the budget involves three steps: the commitment of the expenditure, its
“liquidation? when resources are assigned for payment and the actual payment, when funds are transferred
directly from the Single Treasury Account to the bank account of the supplier.

                                                  31
government, they have yet to be properly utilized to monitor spending for compliance,
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.

48.     Progress on making the State procurement system for goods and services
transparent and efficient was moderately unsatisfactory. Most of the second phase of
procurement reforms has been completed during PRSC-6, including how to handle
complaints by bidders. By publishing a revised Procurement Decree in 2010, reinforcing
UFSA and installing an additional 349 Units for Execution and Management of Acquisitions
(UGEAs) to bring their total to 821 units in 2010, compared to 472 by end-2007, Government
has established the legal framework and institutional architecture of a public procurement
system that generally meets international standards of efficiency and accountability.
However, the lack of an independent complaint system is an issue that has yet to be tackled
and little has been achieved on making the public procurement systems functional and even
less on integrity due to several factors (limited knowledge of procurement legislation, limited
capacity, and resistance to change to adopt new procurement practices by UGEAs). In this
area, the third PRSC series supported reforms aimed at strengthening of the monitoring
system to increase transparency and measure the effectiveness of the reforms. In this regard,
better quality information on the expanded use of public tenders in public sector contracts
became available during 2011, when an estimated 85 percent of the number of contracts
(representing 46 percent of total domestically financed expenditure in goods and services)
was subject to public tender compared to 83 percent of the number of contracts of a much
smaller sample (9 percent) of the same expenditures in 2010. While in the context of e-
SISTAFE some public procurement data is being collected, it does not allow tracking
performance of the system. The launching of a MIS for UFSA based on a web interface to be
used as a management tool to track procurement performance of the key ministries remains
an issue to be addressed.

49.     With regard to the Government’s objective of increasing coverage and efficiency
of internal audit bodies, progress was satisfactory. Progress in the internal audit function
has continued through 2011 and the roll-out of internal oversight bodies (Órgãos de Controlo
Interno, OCI) was completed in January 2012, about one year later than initially expected, at
central and at provincial levels. The internal audit institution (IGF) was substantially
strengthened in recent years and follow up of audit recommendations is now being
monitored. Mozambique received a B rating on effectiveness of Internal Audit (PI-21) in the
2008 PEFA, as the country had established the institutional set-up for internal audit.
However, this rating has been adjusted to a C+ in the PEFA 2010, due to the extent of
management response and audit recommendations implementation. However, the same
report states that, in late 2009, IGF started the development of a database with the objective
to improve the monitoring of the implementation of audit recommendations by institutions.
In this database, completed in 2011, recommendations are classified in categories – criminal,
disciplinary, procedural – and such categories are being improved to be consistent with TA
classification. In addition, an internal rule was established in IGF that requires that the
auditors once completing an audit must feed information into this database. Recently, a
decision was made to track how many of these recommendations have been implemented by
the executive. In this regard, the IGF and the Internal Control Units have specifically
allocated time for follow-up in their audit work plans. The challenge now is to address the
quality aspect of internal audit and control. In this regard, IGF has drafted an audit manual
that is consistent with good practices, and is starting to implement risk-based audit
techniques.


                                              32
50.      As far as increasing coverage and efficiency of external audit bodies, progress
was satisfactory. To inform preparation of the Report ad Opinion on the CGE, the TA
increased the verification audits of the accounts of various public institutions at central and
decentralized level from 361 in 2007 to 600 in 2010. This has allowed the TA to
continuously expand audit coverage of the executed State Budget from 30 percent in FY 2008
to 37 percent and 40 percent in FY 2010 and 2011, respectively. The performance of the
Tribunal Administrativo (TA) improved, and it is now increasingly respected as an
independent and professional PFM watchdog. The Report and Opinion on the Annual State
Accounts (CGE), including full information on revenue, expenditure, financial assets and
liabilities, at all level of government, was submitted to the Parliament within the term
stipulated by law, since 2004, and is available on-line. The TA is now required to use a risk
matrix to select accounts for audit, in which the value of expenditure is a key determinant;
and there is also a planned cycle of audits in which most accounts are audited at least once
every 2.5 years. In terms of the audit of the CGE, it is the Parliamentary Committee on
Finance and Planning that recommends follow-up measures and a report on their
implementation is included in the TA’s audit report for the following year’s CGE. There is
thus a formal response and follow-up to the TA’s report and opinion on the CGE. The
response to other audit findings, however, remains limited.

   (*) The 100 percent target was met in 2011.


51.    With respect to improving human resources management in the public sector
progress was satisfactory. There was good progress in the area of civil service reforms.
Following the Census of Civil Servants, a new medium term salary policy was approved by
the Council of Ministers in 2008 which entailed not only the decompression of the wages but

                                                         33
also the granting of allowances to motivate the civil service to also work in remote areas of
the country. As a result of the new policy implementation, the wage bill increased by about
one percentage point to 10 percent of GDP (representing about 47 percent of tax revenues) by
end- 2012. In the meantime, the government made good progress in the process of moving
towards a fully computerized Human Resources system, including payroll. The 2010 PEFA
assessment, while maintaining PI-18 score at B, refers to the (a) successful piloting of an
electronic salary payment system (e-Folha), a new module of e-SISTAFE, in 2010; and (b) e-
Folha and e-CAF (personnel database system) allowing for timely reconciliation of
information. Roll out of e-Folha progressed as follows: (i) in 2011 to 123 institutions at
central level and 33 entities at provincial level; and (ii) to 170 provincial entities by mid-
2012. At central level roll out is planned to be complete in May 2013. With regard to the
reform of the pension system, limited progress was achieved. At PRSC-6 stage, the
government had launched the diagnostic work to prepare a pensions’ reform to be approved
in 2010. However, the process is complex and requires a thorough analysis to evaluate the
cost and social impacts of implementation. The government has completed an Operational
Assessment of the Civil Service (including military and policy) Pension System. The next
steps are to conduct the actuarial study followed by social impact studies for different reform
proposals.

Economic development

Improving access to credit for private firms: Satisfactory
Strengthening the social security system: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Improving the operation of the land law: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Improving the business environment: Satisfactory
Maximizing the benefits from megaprojects, concessions and PPPs: Highly Satisfactory

Overall achievement: Satisfactory

52.     In the area of access to credit for private firms, satisfactory progress was made
in supporting improvement in accounting and reporting standards through the
implementation of International Financial and Reporting Standards (IFRS). The 2009
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) highlighted that access to finance is one of the top two
constraints to private sector growth and its empirical analysis, taking into consideration
demand factors, found that more than two-thirds of the sample was credit constrained.
Among the factors contributing to slow progress in financial intermediation, the 2009 ICA
and 2009 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) highlighted information constraints
adding that, according to commercial banks, the absence of reliable financial statements in
the private sector is a major constraint for them to provide credit to a large number of firms.
In 2008, the government had prepared an action plan for the introduction of IFRS in the
corporate sector (PRSC-6) 16 and the required legislation adjusting the Tax Code to be
consistent with the adoption of the IFRS was approved by Parliament in May 2009. Also,
Cabinet approved the new Plan of Accounts in the same year. IFRS implementation in large
firms became mandatory in FY 2010 and in medium firms in FY2011 (PRSC7).

53.   With regard to reforms aimed at improving the operation of the land law
progress was moderately unsatisfactory. Given the overall soundness of the land-related

16
  The approval by Parliament of this legislative package would have been a more appropriate prior action for
PRSC-6. However, that was not an option since it was not included in the PAF.

                                                    34
policy and legal framework, the objective of reforms supported in this PRSC series was to
improve implementation instead of revising laws and regulations. To improve the
implementation of the existing land law, the 2009 CEM recommended several measures
including enforcing collection of existing land tax, raise the rates without affecting
smallholder rural producers, and decentralize collection to the district level. In addition,
concerns about speculative acquisition of large amounts of land led government to adopt a
regulatory framework that links award of DUATs (allocation of land use rights) to specific
conditions on land use and revokes such rights in case the conditions are not honored.
However, international experience shows that increasing rural land taxes (possibly
differentiated by land quality/zoning) could be a more incentive-compatible way of
encouraging efficient land use. The Council of Ministers, in September 2008, gave a
mandate to the Ministry of Agriculture to explore a possible reform of the land taxation
system. In December 2009, the Ministry of Agriculture issued a decree updating tax rates for
the use of land to account for inflation for the first time since 1998 (PRSC-7 prior action).
Once a clear data-base of DUATs is available, it will be possible to empirically explore (a)
the revenue potential of a specific reform of the land taxation system, and (b) the implications
of adjusting the rates to better reflect the economic potential of land use in different areas to
incentivize use of the land, while protecting smallholders. Given that preparatory studies
have not yet been completed and more comprehensive land tax reforms require solid social
impact analysis as well as a ample discussion with many stakeholders, the government
decided to implement many intermediate steps, such as a national land management strategy,
a new information system on land, and delimitation of community lands, before more fully
implementing this reform.

54.     Progress in reforms aimed at ensuring the financial sustainability of the social
security system and to adopt the best practices and transparency in the management of
the social security funds was moderately unsatisfactory. The government adopted a broad
program to strengthen the social security system in Mozambique. A new Law on Social
Security was approved by Parliament in 2007, but its implementation has been slow, and
serious shortcomings in the operation and governance of the sector continued to persist,
including (i) significant data gaps, and poor record keeping, at the National Institute for
Social Security (INSS), (ii) weak institutional capacity of the INSS, and (iii) lack of
publication of the INSS financial statements since 2004. A structured set of interventions
was launched to improve the situation at the INSS, which included: introducing an IT system
to create an electronic database of all pensioners and contributors, improving administration,
publishing financial statements and establishing the value of the investment portfolio. In the
area of IT modernization, cooperation between the INSS and the Brazilian government
progressed well in 2011, especially in the IT modernization area. Also, the INSS
implemented the Financial, Human Resources and Administration Management System and
trained users of the system. It also implemented the first phase of the Social Security
Information System and started the implementation of phases two and three. During 2009
substantial progress was made with publication of the financial accounts for 2005, 2006, and
2007. However, publication of the accounts for 2008 and 2009, expected in 2010, was not
accomplished and continued lack of reliable financial statements precluded an accurate
assessment of the financial situation of INSS, and prevented the full determination of
potentially significant fiscal and private liabilities. Overall, limited progress was achieved
and key issues remain to be addressed.

55.   Progress in improving the business environment by simplifying the regulatory
framework and streamlining unnecessary processes was satisfactory. To achieve this

                                               35
objective, the Government launched a 2008-2012 strategy to improve the business
environment, but its overall implementation was slow. However, the introduction of one-stop
shops and simplified licensing regime approved in 2008 for selected businesses represented a
substantial progress in this area. Earlier, the simplified licensing regime was restricted to
seven areas and around 190 economic activities. Subsequently, by adopting the Decree No.
5/2012 of February 2, 2012, an additional seventy-two economic activities were allowed to
register and operate under the simplified procedure, which can be done in one day. The
Simplified Licensing Regime greatly (i) expands the type and number of business activities
that may be licensed by means of simplified requirements and procedures in 9 economic
sectors (agriculture, commerce, industry, civil construction, communications, culture, fishing,
services and tourism); and (ii) reduces administrative costs for the private sector. The
simplified license is available at the One-Stop-Shops, economic activities licensed under this
regime are exempt from ex-ante inspections and environmental impact assessment (EIA) and
documents required for submission don’t need to be notarized and can be presented on paper
or in electronic format. In addition, an inventory covering 700 plus licenses in the most
regulated areas of economic activity was completed in December 2012 and actions to
streamline procedures for commercial and industrial activities are planned for the first half of
2013. Moreover, the Council of Ministers approved the 2009 decree on unified inspections
for business activities, paving the way for the establishment of a new unified inspection
agency (for all inspections except tax and labor inspections). In addition, a new bankruptcy
law was submitted to Parliament, which on March 1, 2013, delegated to the Council of
Ministers the authority to approve the law. Also, several administrative improvements were
introduced, leading to reductions in the average time for import operations to 30 days and 23
days for export operations in 2009. In the meantime, an inventory of all licensing
requirements covering 700 plus licenses in most regulated areas of economic activity was
concluded in December 2012 and to improve transparency and facilitate access to
information on valid licensing procedures, an official e-portal hosting information on valid
licensing requirements and procedures, is being developed by GoM. In spite of reported
progress, Mozambique’s ranking in the Doing Business (DB) Indicators has been dropping
because the pace of change is slower than elsewhere. The country’s ranking in DB has
deteriorated being 146th out of 185 countries in the 2013 report, while it ranked at 139th out of
181 countries in the same report for 2008.

                           business

56.     Progress in reforms to support the government’s effort to achieve membership of
the EITI initiative and to strengthen the legal framework for PPPs and concessions was
highly satisfactory. Mozambique was admitted as EITI candidate country in May 2009 and,
after establishing the EITI secretariat, the first, second and third reconciliation and validation



                                                 36
reports were submitted in January 2011, and March and December 2012, respectively.17 As
part of the validation process the government expanded its disclosure, reporting and
publication requirements for all payments and revenues related to the natural resource sector.
The country was declared fully compliant with the EITI requirements in October 2012.
Challenges ahead include addressing limited transparency in natural resource concession
processes and contracting. With major extractive industry investments planned in the near
future, including natural gas and coal, Mozambique needed a comprehensive framework law
for mega-projects, concessions and PPPs to provide guidelines for project selection and risk
allocation. The new PPP, Large Scale Projects and Business Concessions Law was enacted
by Parliament in 2011 and meets good practice international standards. The new Law
provides a framework for PPP transactions and sets the approach to mega-projects and
natural resource concessions.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Satisfactory

57.     Based on the combined assessment of both relevance and efficacy in the
achievement of objectives, the program overall outcome rating was satisfactory. The
objectives of the third PRSC series, overall and of each component, were and remain highly
relevant to the country’s development priorities and the design of the operation was
consistent with the program’s objectives and remains relevant in the current context. An
impressive growth outcome was achieved while a sound macroeconomic framework was
maintained throughout the program, despite the challenges posed by the global economic
downturn. Satisfactory progress was made in achieving objectives in most policy areas under
the components macroeconomic management and economic development, although limited
progress was achieved in some policy areas such as procurement, social security, pension and
land taxation reforms.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.     The PRSC series supported the objective of promoting broad based growth for
poverty reduction. As mentioned above, impressive economic growth was accompanied by
significant strides in reducing poverty up to 2003. Afterwards, however, sustained rapid
growth has not translated into significant poverty reduction. Household survey data indicate
that the national poverty headcount fell from roughly 69 to 54 percent from 1996 to 2003.
The results of the 2008/09 household survey suggest the response of poverty reduction to
economic growth has since weakened. Due to concerns related to under-reporting of food
consumption in the 2008/09 household survey data, a problem that seems to also affect the
previous two household surveys (in 1996/97 and 2002/03), additional analytical work was
undertaken by the World Bank to test the robustness of the preliminary results and correct for
the data problems.

59.      With regard to poverty dynamics, the new evidence shows that Mozambique is
continuing to experience a general decrease in poverty (Table above).18 However, the
general decrease in poverty has been heavily concentrated in urban areas where only 30
percent of population resides. Rural poverty has remained largely intractable, with the
notable exception of rural areas in the greater Maputo region. Overall, the analysis suggests
that (i) the Southern and urban areas of Mozambique are considerably richer than the official
figures suggest, and growth in these areas has been relatively robust and consistent over time,
and (ii) poverty in the Central and Northern regions of the country, and in rural areas
nationwide, appears to be systematically underestimated in the official statistics.
Nevertheless, the response of poverty reduction to economic growth is confirmed to have
weakened after 2003 and the country would need to considerably accelerate poverty
reduction to halve the population living in absolute poverty by 2015.

60.     There have been significant improvements in social indicators since the mid-
1990s (Table 8 above). There was substantial progress towards meeting some MDG targets,
specifically on improving universal primary education, gender equality and women’s
empowerment. The MDG for sustainable coverage for water supply could also be met, given
the rapid improvements in the provision of urban water supply, although significant progress
is needed to increase access to water in rural areas. Encouraging progress was made on
reducing child mortality, and improving maternal health. However, reducing hunger and
child malnutrition, and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases remains a serious
challenge.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
longer-term capacity and institutional development):

Surveys?, Policy Research Working Paper WPS 6217, The World Bank.

                                                        38
61.     Institution strengthening and capacity building were actively supported by this
PRSC series. There was substantial institutional development and capacity building under
this PRSC series, which is likely to be sustainable especially in the areas of public financial
management, internal and external audit, public sector HR management, IFRS, and natural
resource management (NRM). In this regard, the 2010 PEFA assessment underscores the
substantial institutional development (e.g. expanded use of e-SISTAFE, e-Folha and e-CAF)
that allowed the country to make solid progress towards meeting good PFM practices. Also,
substantial progress was made in putting in place a framework to ensure transparency of
NRM sector and this contributed to having the country declared compliant with EITI
requirements and having a modern law enacted for mega-projects, concessions and PPPs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

62.     PRSC-6 pointed out the limitations imposed by the MoU and related PAF on the
identification of (i) prior actions of that operation, and (ii) indicative triggers for future
operations. Reference was also made to the high transaction costs and weakened quality of
the policy dialogue associated with the excessive number of working groups (72). While this
tendency prevailed during PRSC-7, with the approval of the new PARP and agreement on a
new 2012-2014 PAF refinements were introduced that will make the government-donor
framework more flexible and responsive to the country’s conditions and world economic
environment.

3.4 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

63.     There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Risk to Development Outcome: Moderate

64.     The risks to development outcomes are rated as moderate for the PRSC series.
While external shocks can potentially derail the country’s development efforts, the extended
track record of the government and development partners in handling the challenges posed by
the global financial crisis, and earlier the oil and food price spikes, demonstrates that the
country is likely to be capable to weather those shocks, if they are not too strong, as long as
the parties involved act in a coordinated and cooperative manner. The government’s
performance during the 2009-2011 PAF suggests commitment to engage in the policy
dialogue and move forward with reforms, in a manner generally satisfactory to its
development partners. The agreed 2012-2014 PAF seems to signal momentum for continued
progress in the reform agenda. The country’s weak capacity poses risks, but again
government and donors should be capable to address by supplementing GBS with technical
assistance targeted to key policy reforms. Governance and political factors (e.g. limited
progress in anti-corruption, upcoming elections) are likely to pose some risk of delayed
reforms in key areas, and related decline in donor’s support has the potential to moderately
affect development outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(Relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)



                                              39
5.1 Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

65.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry of the operations being reviewed
was rated as satisfactory. As discussed in Section 3.1 above, the operation was highly
relevant to the country and the Bank priorities given that the selected reforms being supported
by these PRSCs were well aligned with the Government own Second Action Plan for the
Reduction of Absolute Poverty and with priorities highlighted in the Bank’s FY08-11 CPS.
The PRSCs 6-7-8 identification and appraisal have appropriately drawn on substantial
analytical work and diagnostic studies on Mozambique (para. 28), carried out both by the
Bank and other development partners, built on lessons learned from previous PRSCs in
Mozambique and applied the Bank’s “Good Practice Principles for Conditionality.?
However, the absence of recent global PER analytical work is a gap that needs to be
addressed, being key to support the Government’s efforts to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of rising public expenditures with a view to step up their impact on growth and
poverty reduction.

66.     Assessments of relevant program aspects were broadly on target. The program
adequately evaluated institutional, fiduciary and environmental aspects, although in some
areas (e.g. procurement, pensions, INSS and land taxation) undue optimism is likely to have
prevailed on the probability of Government making good progress in those reforms resulting
in the need to drop some indicative triggers. The challenges posed by adherence to the GoM
and G19 MoU and PAF were candidly appraised and the way forward correctly identified as
sticking to the existing rules for multi-donor budget support, while trying to improve them in
the near future. In this regard, in each of the operations of the series, flexibility was
appropriately introduced to focus on actions that would most likely assist the country to
achieve planned development objectives. Capacity building support by other Bank-financed
projects was correctly envisaged to assist Government to implement PFM, Public Sector,
Financial and Private Sector reforms. The M&E framework was well aligned with the
Government’s own M&E arrangements to report on PARPA developments and progress on
PAF-supported reforms. However, the linkages between some reforms (e.g internal and
external audit, MTPP) and selected outcome indicators could have been better formulated, as
they were redundant by restating the prior action as the outcome.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Satisfactory

67.    Quality of supervision was satisfactory. The design and supervision of the PRSCs
was closely linked and well aligned with (i) the MoU agreed between the Government and
the G19 GBS development partners, and (ii) the government’s framework to monitor PARPA
implementation. Given the programmatic nature of these operations, the program benefited
from the supervision of operation ‘n’ being conducted side by side with preparation of
operation ‘n+1’. This has contributed to documenting progress of the reform program on an
annual basis, and to better determine the need of beefing up the program while sticking to its

                                              40
development objectives. Progress in the program was being tracked during the Joint Review
taking place twice a year in the context of the MoU for GBS, as well as the monthly joint
government-donor steering committee meetings and the joint government-donor sector
working groups.       Also, supervision of other Bank-financed projects supporting
implementation of selected PRSC supported reforms provided valuable input to tracking
progress on program implementation. Cooperation between the Bank and other DPs and the
IMF was excellent. The Bank also participated in the IMF missions what helped closely
monitoring the debt sustainability situation and macroeconomic conditions.

68.     An Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) report was prepared for PRSC-8.
This in addition to the wealth of information and data from the Joint Reviews GoM-G19 and
joint missions with the IMF has allowed for continuous supervision of the operations being
reviewed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

69.     Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. According to ICR Guidelines, the
overall ratings are dictated by the combination of ratings for Quality at Entry and Quality of
Supervision. A combination of satisfactory rating at quality at entry and satisfactory rating
for supervision implies a combined rating of satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government Performance/ Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance/ Overall
Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

70.     The Borrower’s performance was satisfactory.                  In these operations, the
Government and implementing agency cannot be distinguished separately. Therefore the
rating in this section should be considered as overall rating for the borrower. The Ministry of
Finance was the leading entity and coordinating body for the reform program. Given the
links between the PRSC supported reforms and the PARPA and its Strategic Matrix, the key
role of the Ministry of Planning and Development in the preparation and monitoring
implementation of PARPA should also be acknowledged.

71.     The Government had strong ownership of the reform program and
demonstrated commitment to its implementation. PARPA II was a fully owned
development strategy reflecting priorities defined the Government. The Government’s
commitment to advance the PARPA-related reforms was underscored by its lead role in (i)
regular reporting to Parliament on economic and social developments, (ii) designing and
ensuring close PARPA-PAF alignment and the related monitoring arrangements, and (iii)
putting together the Joint Bi-Annual Review Meetings with G19 donors. That commitment
was key to the achievement of satisfactory progress on the selected reform program
supported by this PRSC series. It was also critical to the impressive growth outcomes and
sound macroeconomic management delivered during the period covered by this PRSC series.
However, less convincing commitment to some reforms (e.g. procurement, INSS, pension,
land taxation) resulted in progress falling short of expectations anticipated in the third PRSC
series.

6.   Lessons Learned

72.    Three key lessons emerge from the operations under review: (i) PAFs must be
driven by clearly specified policy and institutional reforms; (ii) political economy constraints
should be considered in terms of the risk they pose to the continuity of the reform process;
and (iii) implementation capacity constraints must be identified to guide provision of
technical assistance.

73.     PAFs must be driven by clearly specified policy and institutional reforms
ensuring that outcome indicators are linked to concrete actions rather than vague
aspirational goals. Up to now, PRSCs have been anchored on PAFs focused on the
achievement of desirable objectives which were not necessarily driven by a road map of
prioritized institutional changes and related policy measures. Past experience has shown that
even when the indicators were appropriate, tracking progress was generally difficult due to
limited statistical and M&E capacity. A welcome development is that the new PARP is a
dynamic and flexible document that can be adapted to respond to changing economic and
social conditions and international developments and its indicators, from which the new PAF
have been derived, include policy and institutional measures needed to make progress
towards the established sectoral outcomes. The challenge ahead is how use the new
flexibility to put in place a more policy-oriented PAF.

74.     Political-economy constraints should be evaluated in terms of the risk they pose
to the continuity of the reform process. Political disagreements and conflicting agendas,
although not the only or even necessarily a major obstacle to the reforms supported by the
proposed PRSC—particularly given the inclusive consultative process through which the
PARP was developed—should nevertheless be carefully analyzed and monitored so that the
government can tailor its policy discussions to address potential challenges to the reform
process

75.    Implementation-capacity constraints must be identified in order to guide the
provision of technical assistance. Like PARPA II, the new PARP is ambitious and
complex, and capacity constraints at multiple levels of government may affect the
implementation of reforms and/or appropriately and timely monitoring and evaluating their
impact. Meeting these challenges will require an adequately designed and targeted program
of technical assistance, in the short run, coupled with sustained capacity-building support
over the long run.
