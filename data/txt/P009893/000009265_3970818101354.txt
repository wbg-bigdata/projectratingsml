NARRASETrRA CIOOPOSITE IRRIGATIOS III PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUNKARY
Borrower:                    India, acting by its President (GOI).
Beneficiay:                  Government of Maharashtra (Gol).
Amount:                      IDA Credit SDR 166.4 million (US$160 million
equivalent).
Terms:                       Standard.
Project Description:         The project would encompass two command areas:
Jayakwadi (200,000 ha) and Najalgaon (100,000
ha). The main components for Jayakwadi would
be: (i) completion of irrigation systems on
about 45,500 ha; (ii) completion of main
drains, link drains, and rural roads on about
153,000 ha; (iii) construction of field
channels, drains, and structures on about
68,000 ha and field-channel protection on
about 102,000 ha; (iv) landshaping of about
128,000 ha; (v) development of three
Specially Developed Distributories (SDDs) on
about 7,300 ha; and (vi) technical support to
farmers. For MaLjalgaon, the project would
include: (i) constructing 116 cAnAl regula-
tion structures; (ii) construction of
Majalgaon main canal from km 67 to km 100;
(iii) construction of the distribution system
up to the 1-cusec outlet in an area of about
57,000 ha; (iv) construction of main and
secondary drainage and road networks on about
24,000 ha; (v) on-farm developments and
landshaping of about 24,000 ha;
(vi) development of a Majalgaon SDD on 4,000
ha; and (vii) technical support to farmers.
Other investments would include:
(i) equipment for landshaping and
telecomnunication; (ii) monitoring and
evaluation, (iii) extension service;
(iii) technical and agricultural extension
and research support; and (iv) training,
studies, study tours and consulting services.
The project would increase agricultural
production and farmers' income in the two
I Thsdocume bs a regsijzd disftion and may be used by nreients only in t  n of

comunds. To minimize the risks that farmer
response might not be adequate, or that yield
levels might be lower than anticipated, the
project provides for landshaping and for
system operation methods which will ensure
that all farmers, including tail-enders, will
obtain a reliable water supvly. In addition,
the project focuses on increasing agricul-
tural productivity, especially through the
SDDs', technical support to farmers, research
and development, and monitoring and
evaluation. The combined effects of these
activities should result in a high return per
unit of water and high level of farmers'
participation.

I.  Backxround
Aariculture and Irrisation in India
1.01    With about 750 X inhabitants (mid-1985), India is the vorld's second
most populous country. The annual rate of population increase is about 2.2Z.
Gross Domestic Product, nov estimated at Rs 1,690,000 x (US$141,000 H)
(1983/84) and growing at about 4Z Annually, ranks eleventh in the world.
Income per capita is estimated at Rs 2,330 (US$194) (1983184), makig  ndia
one of the world's poorest countries. Moreover, India has the largest single
concentration of people in absolute poverty on earth, betweea 200 and 250 X;
over 902 of them are rural. The industrial sector is large, sophisticated,
and growing at a respectable 7% per year, yet agriculture still provides the
bulk of India's employment-69%-and generates 32Z of the value added in the
economy. Agricultural growth has been at an annual rate of 4.6Z during the
5th Plan (1974-79) but only 2.0S during the 6th Plan (1979-84), due to three
years of unfavorable monsoons.
1.02    At least three-fourths of agricultural growth stems from the synergy
of fertilizers and improved seeds with a water supply provided by irrigation.
The irrigated area of India, over 60 M hectares, is now second only to that
of China. India is investing more in expansion of irrigation than any other
country. An indication of the high and rising priority attached to irriga-
tion is the share of Plan investments allocated to the sector: 8.6% in the
4th Plan (1969-74), 9.8% in the 5th Plan (1974-79), and 10.6Z in the 6th Plan
(1979-84).
The State of Maharashtra
1.03    General.  With 62.8 H inhabitants (1981), Maharashtra is India's
third largest state and, with 35Z of the population urban, its most
urbanized. The Greater Bombay area aLone has a population of 8.2 H and there
are nuerous secondary industrial centers like Puse, Nagpur and Nashi}.
Hahia.ashtra's urban sector is growing more rapidly than the rural one: in
the 1970s, urban population grew by 3.4Z per year, rural, by 1.6Z.
Maharashtra alzeady has the largest number of factory jobs, as well as the
largest non-agricultural employment of any Indian state. Agriculture.
however, still makes up 26Z of Hsharashtra's gross state product, and
provides 62% of the jobs:  about 8.5 million to owner cultivators and tenants
and 6.5 million to farm lahore-e.



-2-
1.04    The Western Ghats divide the state north-to-south.  The Konkan, vest
of the Ghats, is very humid, with short, steep rivers. The Konkan contains
one-tenth of Maharashtra-s land area and one-quarter of its population, most
of the latter in Greater Bombay. East of the Ghats, the land slopes
gradually towards the Bay of Bengal. The Ghats cast a rain shadow to the
area adjoining their eastern foothills by cutting off the southwest monsoon.
Rovever, rainfall increases east of the foothills. It is concentrated in the
monsoon months of mid-June to September. All but two of the rivers are dry
at the end of the dry season. Natural aquifers are meager and, unlike on the
vast alluvial Ganga Plain of the north, fragmented.
1.05    Agriculture.  Farming in most of Maharashtra is difficult.  The
exceptions are the vell-watered Konkan and the relatively well-watered east-
ern Vidarbha Region, where rice and other humid tropical crops are grown.
Agriculture in the semi-arid bulk of Maharashtra is dominated by
drought-tolerant crops like sorghum (jowar), pearl millet (bajra), various
pulses, cotton and, increasingly, groundnuts and sunflowers.  Farming systems
are adjusted to the scarce rainfall, to the large deviations from annual
norms, and to the area's black cotton soils. The dominant farming systen in
middle Maharashtra, Marathwada and western Vidarbha is to plant crops at the
end of the rains on residual moisture, and to harvest them in winter. A
relatively low level of inputs is used and the yields Are correspondingly
low. In fertilizer consumption per cropped hectare, relatively prosperous
and modern Maharashtra ranks 11th amongst India's 17 major states. The value
of output per hectare is one of the lowest in India; yields of all crops are
below the rest of India, except for sugarcane and banana, which are grown
entirely under irrigation.
1.06    The average holding in 1970/71 was 4.3 ha; it declined to 3.7 ha by
1976177. According to official statistics, 92% of Maharashtra-s farms are
owner-operated, 5Z are partly owned and partly rented, and only 3% are under
tenancy arrangements-demonstrating the effectiveness of land reform.  The
distribution of farm size is:
Size of Holding         Area          # of Farms
(ha)
0-1 ha.            706,200       1,505,400
1-2 ha.          1,675,600       1,142,100
2-4 ha.          3,832,800       1,339,500
4-10 ha.          8,337,800       1,351,800
10+ ha.          6,552,500         425,500
Most of the 425,500 farms over 10 ha have low-quality, drought-prone land;
their owner-operators are more likely to be little more than subsistence
farmers.
1.07    Irritation.  Kaharashtra is a latecomer to investing in irrigation.
As recently as 1973, only 750,000 ha were covered by major and medium surface
irrigation projects. The potential created increased considerably in the
last decade, and is Dresently 1.5 N ha under major and medium surface
projects and 1.8 million from wells and minor surface irrigation (Map IBRD
No. 18618R). Rowever, the area with irrigation facilities is only 12% of the
area farmed, amongst the lowest in India (cf. the national average of 33%).



-3-
There are several reasons for the slow development of the irrigation poten-
tial. Groundwater development is difficult and costly because aquifers are
generally fragmented and not plentiful (para 1.04). Surface irrigation is
difficult because river flows are highly seasonal and there are no good
reservoir sites. Reservoirs require large structures, inundate large areas
per unit of water stored, are shallow and therefore lose much water by
evaporation. These factors make irrigation development costly and relatively
high incremental benefits are required to make it economically viable. After
a long period of research and experiments with the difficult Deccan black
cotton soils, adequate construction and agricultural production techniques
have now been identified for economically viable irrigated farming system.
Previous Bank Groui-Assistance
1.08    Major problems in earlier generations of surface irrigation projects
were the time lag between dam construction and completion of minor canals and
farm-level facilities, and, in some cases, slow development of the demand for
irrigation water. Bank Group support to irrigation has concentrated on the
"scarcity3 and the adjoining "assured rainfall" zones, (under 900 mm annual
precipitation) through four credits, of which two have been completed. The
first was the Purna Project CCr. 23-IN) in 1962. That project financed the
storage dams, the main canal and the distributaries, but not the works below
the cbak outlet.  The first Maharashtra Composite Irrigation Project (MCIP I)
(Cr. 736-IN, 1977) addressed the problem of on-farm development in the Purna
and Jayakwadi Projects. Much agricultural and engineering experience has
been gained during implementation. The black cotton soils, which are dif-
ficult to cultivate, and create severe problems in constructing and maintain-
ing irrigation channels, were thoroughly studied and satisfactory solutions
have been identified. A detailed evaluation of Credit 736-IN is provided
in a recent Project Completion Report (November 1984).
1.09    Of the two ongoing projects, the Second Maharashtra Composite Irriga-
tion Project (MCIP II) (Cr. 954-IN and IFAD 23-IN, 1979, closing in 1985)
fimanced the upgrading of two existing projects (Kula and Girna) and part of
the construction of six relatively new projects (Upper Wardha, Upper Pen-
ganga, Kukadi, Krishna, Warns and Bhima) to improved design standards. It
was the first "time-slice" project in Maharashtra, with the objective of
completing all development down to the farm gate, to ensure that benefits
begin to flow soon after the investments have been made. The Maharashtra
Water Utilization Project (MWUP) (Cr. 1383 and Lu. 2308-IN, 1983, closing
1988) financed improvements of the irrigation network of underutilized
irrigation schemes of Hula, Girna, Purna, Khadakwasla and Jayakwadi. That
project was designed to bridge the gap between the speedy creation of surface
irrigation potential (dams, main canals) during the 1970s and the slow
utilization of this potential. It was estimated that about 750,000 ba com-
mended, in which the potential created was not fully utilized, could be
brought quickly and cheaply into improved production through a series of
"water utilization operations," by providing only the most essential, but
hitherto missing, elements to link the main infrastructure to the farmers'
plots, while deferring some other works (lining of distributaries and minors,
drainage, roads). It is too early to assess results of that approach,
although positive trends can be seen; it is clear, however, that it will
need, within a short while, complementary investments to add the deferred
elements, particularly landshaping and agricultural support, which are



-4-
required to realize the full potential of irrigation benefits. To date
InA/Bank commitments to the Maharashtra surface irrigation sector have been
US$347.7 million of which IDA accounts for US$325 million and for the Bank
US$22.7 million.
1.10    Other Bank Group support for Maharashtran agriculture has focused
on research, extension and credit. The National Agricultural Research
Project (Cr. 855-IN, 1979, closing September 1985), supported research of
rainfed agriculture through the State agricultural universities and performed
well. The Mabarashtra Agricultural Extension Project (Cr_ 1135-IN, 1981,
closing June 1987), is highly rated and proceeding on schedule in its objec-
tives of reorganizing and strengthening agricultural extension. The Bank
Group has supported agricultural credit, starting with Maharashtra Agricul-
tural Credit Project (Cr. 293-IN), followed by four All-India credits, the
latest of which is ARDC IV (Lu. 2095-IN)/Cr. 1209-IN, 1982). ARDC IV
encountered .ajor management problems, notably in large and growing overdues,
as well as deficiencies in covenant compliance and reporting.
Rationale for-Bank Group Involvement
1.11    Jayakwadi is Maharashtra's largest irrigation scheme. While there
have been difficulties with realization of irrigation benefits in the past,
it is the opinion of experts familiar with Deccan agriculture that with
experience gained under the previous stages, in other projects on the black
cotton soils and with certain improvements supported under the proposed
project, agriculture production is ready to take off. Better management of
the lands (drainage, landshaping, tillage), the water (appropriate distribu-
tion systems down to the farms, reliable and timely supply, meticulous O&M of
the systems) and improved support services and incentives to the farmers
(farmers- organization, training, input supply, equipment, technical advice,
appropriate crops, and marketing outlets), are expected to enhance cultiva-
tion, irrigation and production. But most important is the introduction of a
different managerial approach and style, where the best expertise will not
"trickle down" but dwell within the project, the waterways, the experimental
stations and the farmers. Organization of the farmers, demonstration of
results obtained by farmers when given the right conditions and advice,
meticulous rotational water supply, full control of soil moisture (drainage,
landshaping), year-round accessibility (roads) and the like, have not been
applied in the past on a meaningful scale in Maharashtra.  Bank Group invol-
vement would: (a) assure that works are completed to agreed and adequate
standards, so that the system will perform smoothly and to its full capacity
(b) change the emphasis from construction to a production-oriented project,
toward which the main management effort and support will be directed and
(c) institute a manAgement system that would shoulder increasing day-to-day
responsibility to the farmers and the systems operators. All this involves
promoting and accelerating drainage works, landshaping and access roads,
establishing the four distributaries (Specially Developed Dis-
tributaries-SDDs) as spearheads for agricultural development, enhancing
adaptive research, establishing efficient 0&M, organizing the farmers, and
promoting new technologies and crops. With Bank Group involvement, these
vital changes are likely to take place faster and increase the viability of
investments already made in the past, and the additional ones contemplated
under the project.



II. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01    The project area includes the Jayakwadi and Majalgaon commands, a
gross commanded area (GCA) of about 330,000 ha. The culturable commanded
area (CCA) i.e. land potentially irrigable and available for cultivation, is
about 300,000 ha.J1 The area stretches in a narrow strip along the Godavari
river-10-20 km wide on both banks-for about 210 km, to the Purna river on
the left bank and to the Sankher, a minor seasonal stream close to Nanded, on
the right bank. The Jayakwadi/lajalgaon scheme has been designed to operate
at full development as one integrated system. It consists of five main
elements: (a) The Paithan reservoir with a live storage of 2,850 Km gross;
(b) the left bank canal (PLBC) 208 kmo long, with a carrying capacity of
100.8 m3/sec, serving a CC& of 154,000 ha and supplying 5 branches, 41 dis-
tributaries and 39 minors; {c) the right bank canal (PRBC) 132 km long with a
carrying capacity of 63.7 m /sec, supplying 46,000 ha through 80 dis-
tributaries; (d) the Maialgaon reservoIr with a live storage of 311 Nm3,
regulating annual fl vs of 403 Mm  from the Sindphana river, and a transfer
flow of up to 468 No per year from Paithan. Majalgaon reservoir releases
its water (and Paithan leftovers) to (e) a right bank canal (NEBC) 165 km
long, with a carrying capacity of 82.6 m3/sec, serving a CCA of about
100,000 ha through 94 branches, distributaries and minors. The project area
spans six administrative districts (Map IBRD 18630). They are: Aurangabad,
Jalna and Parbhani commanded by the Paithan Left-Bank Canal (PLBC), and
Abmednagar, Bhid and Nanded commanded by the Paithan Right-Bank Canal (PRBC)
and the Majalgaon Right-Bank Canal (NRBC).
Climate (Annex 1, Table 1)
2.02    The climate is sub-tropical. Three seasons can be distinguished:
the kharif or monsoon season (June 15-October 1) during which 80% of the
annual precipitation falls; the rabi, or sunny, cool season (October
1-February 28) when most of the remaining 20% rainfall comes, and the rain-
less hot season (March 1-June 15) when the relative humidity is the lowest
and temperatures reach their peak, usually between late April and early June.
Rainfall increases from about 600 mm/year at the western end of the project
area to 900 mm at the eastern, lower reaches. The rains begin and end at
much the same time through the project area; the difference lies mainly in
the extent and number of sto,ms.
2.03    In the principal growing seasons (June to March) the difference
between monthly temperature means is only about 80C. The mean minimum tem-
perature in December/January is about 130C, which is marginal for tiller and
ear initiation in wheat but adequate for ensuring high sucrose content in
11 Additional 30-40,000 ha (10-15Z) are expected to be irrigated in the
future through low-lift pumping within the commands, and on the unir-
rigated banks of the Jayakwadi and Majalgaon canals.



-6-
sugarcane; it also enables a vide range of crops to be grown in the rabi
season (para 2.14-2.16).
Toyonahl
2_04    Geologically, the project area belongs to the Deccan trap basement
complex. The topography is open, rolling, with isolated, typically angular
hills. The drainage lines are deeply incised, but mostly carry only storm
water; they are usually dry outside the monsoon season. Overall elevation is
between 450-550 m above sea level; the general slope is from west to east,
approximately following the course of the Godavari river.
2.05    The rolling countryside has made an extensive soil conservation
progran necessary. Grassed-over earth bunds, designed to slow down, impound
and harmlessly divert rainwater that the soil cannot absorb, have been con-
structed in the past, either by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) or by the
farmers, under SCS guidance.  Slopes in the CCA are as follows:
below 0.6Z      31Z
0.6 - 1.0O      21%
1   - 2  %      34%
above 2%        14%
Soils
2.06    The soils are clayey black cotton soils, formed in situ from the
basaltic basement complex rocks. Small alluvial strips occur near the major
water channels but their extent is insignificant. Black cotton soils shrink
when dry and are self-mulching. The surface crumbling enters the cracks and
therefore, when wetted, the soil surface tends to fold slightly. Vertical
permeability, once the soils reach field capacity, is slow (in contrast to
horizontal permeability, which is quite high). Therefore, after heavy rain
or irrigation, plant roots tend to remain waterlogged for several days if the
crop is planted on flat ground, i.e. without ridging or bedding. This
impedes root development, subsequent drought resistance and nutrient uptake.
To overcome these problems in Maharashtra as elsewhere in the world on
similar soils, the traditional farming pattern is to plant most crops when
the rains ease off; they mature on the moisture stored in the profile. The
high horizontal water conductivity, which weakens the internal shearing
forces of the soils, and enables side-slopes to slide, makes lining of water
channels, especially the main canal, the distributaries and most of the
minors, almost an unavoidable necessity.
2.07    The major soil characteristics, determining agricultural production
potential, are closely dependent on the soil's depth to bedrock and its clay
content. Soil depth is, on the whole, satisfactory:
Shallow         (below 40 cm)        21%
Medium          (40-250 cm)          24%
Deep            (above 250 cm)       55Z
Since the underlying layer in most cases is fractured, easily weathered
murrum rock, the agricultural potential of most of the shallow soils can,
over tine, be built up, if sufficient care is taken with initial landshaping.



-7-
2.08    Structurally, about 75Z of the soils are classed as clay loams and
heavier. Soils with a clay content of over 601 are more extensive in the
western end of the area, near the Paithan dam; the clay content decreases
towards the eastern boundary of the project but is still high. Therefore,
the agronomic problems at opposite ends of the project area differ only in
their severity: for the more delicate crops, like groundnuts and cotton,
careless cultural practices result in water-logging of the root zone, and
yields decrease, more on the heavier than on the lighter soils.
2.09    Soil fertility is generally good:  because of the basaltic origin,
potash content is adequate for all but the most demanding crops (sugarcane
and bananas) or unless yield expectations are high. Nitrogen and phosphates,
especially the forwer, are, however, deficient for even medium yield levels
and must be added: the current recommendations are based on the principle of
nutrient removals which appears, from experimental evidence, to be satisfac-
tory.
Population and Land Tenure (Annex 1, Table 2)
2.10    Farms of 5 ha or more account for about two-thirds of the cultivated
area. The average farm size in the two commands is 4.5 ha. Most farms are
owner operated. The tenancy situation in the project area is typical of that
for the State as a whole (para 1.06).
2.11    As elsewhere in rural Maharashtra east of the Ghats, the population
density is relatively low, about 210 per km . Although 35X of the population
is landless, there is shortage of labor in peak season, resulting in wide use
of seasonal migrant farm labor. The migrants come mostly from the less
developed parts of the state, and also from Madhya Pradesh and Orissa,
usually for harvesting sugarcane and for construction jobs.
Land Use
2.12    The net cropped area, i.e. land planted with one or more crops in a
given year, is about 70X of the gross area. Forests and land not available
for cultivation account for about 6%; fallows and culturable waste, for the
balance 24Z. There is almost no scope for increasing the net cropped area
since most of the cultivable land is already cultivated. GON is aware of the
insufficient forest area and an active tree-planting program is being pursued
on lands deemed hetter suited for forestry than agriculture. Therefore, the
total cropped area can only be significantly increased by increasing double
cropping, which would require an expansion of the irrigated area.
2.13    In the rainfed areas, farming is at or near subsistence level and the
crops grown, except for the low-yielding, short-staple cotton, are mostly
food and fodder crops. In the irrigated areas, cash crops are also grown,
especiaLly long-staple cotton, groundnuts and wheat (which is a cash crop in
Naharahi.-ra).



-8-
Crops and Yields (Annex 1, Tables 21 and 22)
2.14    SorRhum is the staple food crop, which also produces the stover to
maintain milch and draft animals. Hybrids are increasingly taking over from
the indigenous varieties because of their considerably higher yield poten-
tial, although many farmers maintain a small area of indigenous sorghum for
home consumption. Pearl millet has begun to replace sorghum, because it
exhausts the soil less and land preparation for the following irrigated rabi
crops is easier than after sorghum. Green and black tram are traditional
kharif pulse crops, which, however, suffer either when rains are excessive or
during long dry spells. Chickpea is the pulse for the rabi season; safflower
is the traditional, drought-resistant oilseed crop, often consumed at the
farm.
2.15    Under irrigated conditions, usually where there are wells for augmen-
tation of water supply, sugarcane is the farmers' first choice. It is an
easy crop to grow, well adapted to soil and climatic conditions of the
project area with a ready market at the cooperative sugarmills. However, its
water requirement is very high. Wheat has been introduced with surface
irrigation, although the aestivum varieties usually grown in Maharashtra are
at, or beyond, their ecological limit on account of the usually mild winters
(para 2.03).  Many farmers grow the more reliable durum species, on which
research and development work is, unfortunately, minimal in Maharashtra.
Groundnuts are increasing in popularity, especially when planted and har-
vested during the hot season. A limited but increasing area is planted just
before, or just after, the start of the monsoon rains. Cotton is a popular
cash crop: the short-stapled arboreum species are usually grown without
irrigation; the medium and medium-long-stapled hirsutum varieties are grown
under irrigation, although they thrive reasonably well without irrigation,
especially at the eastern end of the project area. Cultural practices for
cotton, including pest control, are good.
2.16    Certain crops that could be grown face market constraints. Maize
grows well in both the kharif and rabi, but it is not appreciated as a food-
crop, and there are, as yet, no facilities for manufacture of starch, corn
oil and maize gluten in Maharashtra. Sovabeans also grow reasonably well but
cannot be readily marketed, unlike in neighboring Madhya Pradesh. A notable
exception are sunflowers, the area of which is increasing; the seeds can be
marketed for oil extraction. With relatively little further adaptive
research effort, it will undoubtedly become an important crop, suitable for
growing in both kharif and rabi.



-9-
A ricultura* Extension
2.17    Under the Maharashtra Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 1135-IN),
agricultural extension in the project area was, in 1983, absorbed into the
six district extension services 1/. As a result, some of the Village Exten-
sion Workers (VEWs), and most of their first- and second-line supervisors and
Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) became responsible for larger farmer groups
than when they worked only in the project area; moreover, they now have to
divide their attention between problems encountered by farmers who irrigate
and those who do not. With this increased work load, they were not able to
devote sufficient training and attention to the time-consuming, diverse
problems of irrigated agriculture. Nor are there now sufficient VEWs; the
VEW-farmer ratio in irrigated lands has been increased to 1:1200. However,
changes already approved by the Agriculture Department (AD) intend to
increase the numbers of VEWs to a ratio of 1 to 800 farmers. The extension
staff dealing with irrigation is due to be strengthened with a Subject Matter
Specialist (SMS) trained in irrigation agronomy and water management.
ALriculturai Research
2.18    Agricultural research in the project area is the responsibility of
the Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani. The University's on-campus
research is at present mainly oriented towards varietal improvement, inter-
cropping and multiple cropping, although under the ongoing first National
Agricultural Research Project (NARP; Cr. 855-IN) the University operates a
small project that investigates yield responses to different levels of
irrigation. The University operates a cotton research station in Nanded and
an oilseed research station in Latur, both in the 1300 mm rainfall zone.
Under the Maharashtra Water Utilization Project-MWUP-(Cr. 1383/Ln. 2308-IN)
the University is expected to operate an adaptive research program in two
locations within the already irrigated portions of the project area, to
investigate and develop appropriate cultural practices, irrigation layout,
limited input application and other on-farm practices not addressed pre-
viously by their research program. This work is slowly getting underway.
Other-Asricultural-Services
2.19    Seed, fertilizer and pesticide supplies are under the surveillance of
the District Agricultural Development Officer (DADO) who is attached to the
Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Parishad, the district administrative
authority. Apart from collecting statistical information on the inputs
situation in the district, it is the DADOVs task to anticipate supply con-
straints, and to initiate appropriate action to alleviate them. On the
whole, the system works well; if a shortage arises, it is at least evenly
distributed throughout the area, and corrective measures are promptly taken.
2.20    Fert-lizer use is well established.  There are sufficient outlets
within easy reach of farmers who possess ox carts. One third of the outlets,

Administration in the project area.



-10-
operated by the cooperative societies, account for all the trade generated by
institutional credit. Almost all fertilizer outlets also sell seeds, pes-
ticides and plant protection equipment. Outlets are licensed and must show
proof of working capital and adequate storage facilities. Because of the
vell organized supply lines and accessibility to Fertilizer Corporation of
India's depots, annual turnover in the average outlet is healthy 13-14 fold,
thereby rendering this low-margin business profitable. Consumption shows an
upward trend, properly balanced between the major nutrients.
2.21    Seeds are provided by the National and the Maharashtra State Seeds
Corporations whose main task is to supply the cooperative outlets. In addi-
tion, there are many private producers of certified and hybrid seeds who are
tightly controlled by the Seed Certification Agency and market, usually
through the fertilizer outlets, under their own brand names. The only seeds
that are occasionally in short supply are those of hybrid cotton and the more
popular sorghum hybrids.
2.22    Pesticides are also in adequate supply, as are sprayers to apply
them. Hovever, the product advisory service is weak; the dealers are not
trained to advise on the use of pesticides and sprayers, unlike for seeds and
fertilizers. This puts a major responsibility on the agricultural extension
staff. However, progress is evident in the increasing use of pyretbroids for
cotton and the good results obtained.
2.23    Manufacture of aRricuItuirwl- implements is widespread.  The several
local designs for implements suitable for primary and secondary tillage are
good and innovative; it seems reasonably certain that any new design, found
useful, can be cheaply and efficiently produced in the region.
2.24    Marketing-and- ProcessinR.  The project area is covered by a network
of regulated markets, ten of which were built under the now completed MCIP I
project. They function satisfactorily. By far the largest marketed good is
sugarcane. It is processed in four sugarmills, under contracts with the
growers.
2.25    Azricu-lttura-cred-it, both long and short term, is available from the
state-owned commercial banks, and the cooperative banks. lIedium and
long-term loans for approved agricultural purposes are provided by the banks
and 75Z refinanced by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development
(NAhARD). Commercial banks are required by law to maintain a stipulated
minimum portion of their portfolio in agricultural loans. They seek to reach
the targets by making large loans to agro-industries or commercial farmers
wherever possible, because loans to these borrowers are eligible for
refinancing by NABARD. However, medium and long-term lending is limited
because an estimated 80-90X of the farmers are defaulters and therefore
ineligible for new loans through the institutional credit system.
2.26    Short-term credit, principally for fertilizers,pesticides and seeds
is well organized, and its volume increases modestly every year.



-11-
Roads and Communication
2.27    Both the left bank (PLBC) and the right bank (PRBC) including Majal-
gaon command (MRBC) are served by main state roads which run parallel to the
Godavari river, interconnected by four main roads with bridges across the
Godavari. These, together with the Aurangabad-Nanded-Hyderabad railroad are
the principal arteries of the project area, connecting the cities of Auran-
gabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Nanded, Purli, lajalgaon, Bhid and Abmednagar to the
national grid. But the development of rural roads is lagging. Rural roads
have a special importance on black cotton soils, where any sort of traffic is
almost impossible during the rains and without roads all agricultural
activities come to an halt, with resultant crop losses. Under prevailing
road development criteria about 1,800 km of rural roads are required ade-
quately to serve the project area. Only about 25% (450 km) existed before
1977 and about 15Z (250 km) have been taken up by MCIP I. MWUP made no
provision for roads, to minimize per ha costs. In addition to the rural
roads, there are also over 300 km of service roads along the main and dis-
tributary canals and drains of the irrigation systems which are used mainly
for maintenance. Rural roads are usually unpaved, except for small portions
close to the towns and the sugarmills. The Public Works Department (PWD)
maintains the roads, but only the state highways (SH) are well kept. Trains
and buses serve the major towns; truck service is available in commercial
centers. However, the principal means of transportation continue to be the ox
carts, and occasionally wheeled tractors and trailers. Aurangabad, the
project headquarters, is equipped with an all-weather airport, served twice
daily by Indian Airlines.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Origin. Scope and Objectives
Proiect- Orizin
3.01    The First Stage.  The Jayakwadi/Majalgaon scheme is a long-term
program to develop irrigation over about 300,000 ha along Godavari river in
west Maharashtra (para 2.01). It started in 1965. By mid-1977 the main
storage reservoir at Paithan, the upper segments-about one-third-- of the
main Paithan Left Bank (PLBC) and Right Bank (PRBC) Canals and a partial area
development of about 53,000 ha on the upper reaches of Jayakwadi command,
mostly on the PLBC, were completed.
3.02    The Second Stage.  The second stage, and Bank involvement, began in
mid-1977 with MCIP I (Cr. 736-IN). It covered the construction of the miss-
ing two-thirds of the two main canals of Jayakwadi command, distributary and
minor canals on 95,000 ha, and on-farm development (OFD), including landshap-
ing, on 45,000 ha. In 1982, upon completion of these 45,000 ha, GOM provided
Jayakwadi Command Area Development Authority (CADA) with additional funds to
proceed with OFD works on a further 33,650 ha. This new area was developed
without drainage systems, roads, and landshaping. During that stage, more



-12-
emphasis was given to the construction of the main and distributary canal net-
work than to on-farm works. Further, it was found that the 53,000 ha developed
by GOM during the first stage were poorly utilized, due to shortfalls in design,
construction and implementation, lack of OFD, and deficient operation of the
system. This, combined with the difficulties in cultivating the black cotton
soils resulted in low production levels.
3.03    Intermediate Stages.  The NCIP II (Cr. 954-IN and IFAD Ln. 23-IN),
allocated a small percentage of the funds to the Jayakwadi command, to support
staff training and pilot command area development. They covered: (i) the estab-
lishment of the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI), to train newly
recruited irrigation staff of all CADAs in Maharashtra; (ii) the upgrading of
field irrigation channels to farms on part of the underutilized first stage
lands; (iii) "Pilot Project" was started in 1979 on about 4,000 ha, and a second
program, called "Farmers' Project" was initiated in 1980, covering about
7,000 ha. The lessons learned from these two modes of irrigation development
down to the farms were incorporated in the Maharashtra Water Utilization Project
(MWUP, para 1.09). In Jayakwadi, it included the upgrading and integration of
42,350 ha of the first stage development that were not covered by the "Pilot"
and "Farmers" projects.
3.04    In accordance with the long-range plans for Jayakwadi/Majalgaon scheme,
GOM started in 1980 to build the Majalgaon dam on the Sindphana River, a
tributary of the Godavari, about 145 km downstream the Paithan dam. The Majal-
gaon reservoir, which is due to become operational by mid-1985, feeds a 165 km
long main canal (Plan IBRD 26834) on its right flank, of which the first 67 km
have been under construction since 1981. The cost of the dam and earthwork on
the first 67 km of the main canal, 1/ which would not be financed under the
proposed project, is about US$66 M, including physical and price contingencies.
3.05    The Third State, which begins with the proposed project, aims to:
Ci) complete the irrigation network and the OFD works over the entire two com-
mands to the same standards; and (ii) adopt effective OM procedures through the
commands. A fourth stage will be needed to complete development of the lower
Majalgaon commaand.
Proiect Scope and Obiectives
3.06    Scope.  As described above, the Jayakwadi command has been developed
over a long period to varying standards. It would be essential to bring it to a
uniform level with respect to irrigation network, drainage, roads and landshap-
ing. The proposed project would consolidate development of the Jayakwadi com-
mand and expand irrigation into the new Majalgaon command. The total project
area will extend to about 300,000 ha. With strong emphasis on water management
and agricultural production practices, project activities would trigger a
self-sustained process of agricultural growth.
3.07    Obiectives.  The main objective of the project is to improve utilization
of the black cotton soils and the available water supply to raise substantially
agricultural production and farmers' incomes. It would: (a) complete the
missing infrastructure elements in all the segments of Jayakwadi command to a
uniformly satisfactory standard; (b) stimulate and promote agricultural develop-
ment of all the command; (c) advance the development of the associated Majalgaon
command (100,000 ha), so that the first segment (24,000 ha) would be completed
during the present stage; and (d) introduce improved O&M procedures.

Maior Works
3.09    Canal construction. About 60 km of main and branch canals, 615 km of
distributaries and 1550 km of minors will be constructed andlor lined under
the project. All canals down to the 1 cfs level will be lined. Wherever the
alignment passes through black cotton soils, a backing of cohesive
non-swelling (CNS) material will be placed. The volume of works for the main
and distribution system is:
Earthworks (MR3) -    9_00
Ling (Mm2)        -   12.00
Structures (No.)  -    1200
3.10    Main and link drainage. About 2,120 km of main and 3,500 km of link
drains will be constructed to connect the chak drainage systems to the
natural drains.
3.11    Roads. About 657 km of rural roads will be constructed throughout
the Jayakwadi area and within the first segment (24,000 ha) of Najalgaon. In
addition, about 250 km of service roads will be part of the construction of
the new main and distributary irrigation canals and main drains (paras 3.34
and 5.29-5.30).
Coumand Area Development (CAD) Works
3.12    Field Channels. About 6,800 km of field channels linking the chak
outlets with each farm (or group of farms if less than 1 ha) will be
provided. The field channels will be sodded and provided with selective
protection  over about 20X of their length (para 3.30). While partial linLng
implies the need of more regular maintenance, it also reduces construction
costs and puts the necessary maintenance within the competence and ability of
the farmers served by the channel. The length of field channels is about
70 m/ha and about 14 m/ha will be protected. The volume of on-farm irriga-
tion works is:
Field Channels (Ka) 6,800
Field Channel Protection (km) 1,360
Chak Structures (No.) 15,000
3.13    Field Drainaze. About 4,500 km of field drains will be constructed
as part of the CAD program. They will be completed before commencement of
landshaping, sodded and protective structures constructed where necessary.
Field drains are of extreme importance on the BC soils for quickly draining
the heavy monsoon rains during kharif, for disposing of excessive irrigation
water, and for lowering the water table. Topography, farm boundaries,
irrigation outlets, location of natural waterways and nullabs, and soils and
rainfall data will dictate the location and the size of the systems. The
CADA, through the farmers organizations (para 5.22), would ensure regular
maintenance, avoid negligence by the users which is common with these kind of
facilities, and could result in waterlogging and/or salinity. The field
drainage plans, prepared by CADA, will be part of the overall land develop-
ment planning.



-15-
3.14    Landshaving. Project authorities will provide special technical support to
farmers to promote landshaping, vhich is required on about 80Z of the irrigated
areas. Landshaping vithiu a chak would conform to an overall chak plan, to ensure
that all fields can be readily irrigated and integrated into the surface drainage
system. CADA vould prepare this overall plan, and would oversee its implementation,
irrespective of the actual entity that does the work. For further details see
paras 3.35-3.36; 5.15-5.20 and Annex 3.
3.15    An agreement has been reached with CON that it would plan, design, construct,
operate and maintain the irrigation, drainage and road networks, and the on-farm
development of the project, including the lining of all main distributaries and
minors down to the I cfs outlets, and plan, design and help implementing landshaping
in accordance with standards and criteria satisfactory to the Bank Group (para 9.02
[a]).
3.16    The SpeciallX Developed Distributaries (SDDs). Four SDDs would be estab-
lished under the project. Farmers in these comuands would be carefully coached to
attain the production potential that can be achieved under an accelerated, properly
focussed agricultural development program.  The SDDs are aimed at triggeriug a
process of accelerated agricultural development in the project area. This approach
was decided upon by GCO, following a careful analysis of past experience. Two SDDs
would be located near the head and tail reaches of the PLBC, one in the command of
the PRBC, and one in the command of the MRBC; the latter would not be established
until 1986, when the distributary is built and its command developed. The irrigation
system in the SDDs would be rapidly upgraded to the standards envisaged for the
entire project area, and the farmers-given strong technical and extension support
by the project-encouraged to take advantage of the improved production environment.
3.17    The SDDs would be given further management help by ID through a steering
committee (paras 5.23-5.25) and through C&A&'s special provisions, to ensure a speedy
organization of farmer groups (para 5.22) for efficient water distribution, communal
mintenance of field channels, adaptation of improved irrigation practices, and
access to credit and input supplies. Each SDD would develop promptly, with project
support, field irrigation and cultural practices that would enable multiple cropping
to the maximm  extent compatible with water and labor availabilities, and mimize
production and income levels. It is expected that the quick results, and effective
use of the extension service, will demonstrate to farmers throughout the project area
the pay-off of concentrated efforts in irrigated agriculture in this difficult
environment. A parallel activity would be to identify the constraints to increased
production of potentially viable crops which are not yet grown on any important scale
(e.g., soyabean, maize) but could widen the range of crops grown and marketed suc-
cessfully in the region.
3.18    During the first two years of project implementation all concerned GON
departments would give high priority of initiating the SDDs and support it to the
extent necessary to ensure their success. To support the foregoing, an agreement has
been reached with GON that: (i) by August 31, 1985, it would establish and thereafter
maintain a Steering Committee for promotion of agricultural development, such commit-
tee to be headed by the Secretary of the Irrigation Department and to meet, at least,
every six months; and (ii) by December 31, 1985, furnish to the Association a
detailed plan for carrying out each of the Specially Developed Distributary under the
Project. (para 9.02 [b]).

Equipment. Technical Services and Extension
3.19    Equiument. Equipment costing about Rs 69.5 N (US$5.8 JR) will be purchased
for landabaping. telecommunications and monitoring (Annex 1, Tables 9, 13a and b).
Provisions have been made for purchase and installation of a radio-telephone network
in the Eajalgaon area, linking the dam, catcbment and service area. Communications
vill be provided down to each distributary control structure. The new Maialgaon
network will be linked to the existing Jayakwadi network, that will also be upgraded
to allow unified and improved control of all the entire complex. Agreement has been
reached with GOI that it would issue all the authorization and permits required to
enable GON to improve in Jayakwadi, and establish in Majalgaon, a radio communication
network (para 9.01 [a]).
3.20    Investigations. Trainina and Studies. Provisions have been macke for relevant
investigations, training and studies which would accelerate the attaining of project
objectives. Accordingly, agreement has been reached with GON that it would, not
later than December 31, 1985, prepare and furnish to the Association for its review
and comments, a detailed work plan covering the activities to be undertaken to
(i)  strengthen basic traiinsg facilities in WALMI and CADA for technical and
operational staff as well as for farmers;
(ii) organize study tours of key personnel of CADA, and AD to suitable areas with
problems similar to those encountered on the black cotton soils of
Maharashtra and where farmer organizations for water distribution below the
outlet are very effective;
(iii)  conduct water management research and overall system operation studies, to
improve water use efficiency in the project area, in accordance with studies
initiated under MMWI; and prepare hydrological and transient flow models for
the entire Jayakvadilpajalgaon project area;
(iv) establish a soils laboratory which would investigate fertility, irrigation
and soil mechanics problems relevant to the project; and
gv)  investigate and refine appropriate farming technologies, and thereafter
implement such work plan (para 9.02 [c]).
3.21    Suecial Technical Services.  Experience in the Jayakwadi and other projects
under similar soil and climatic conditions in Maharashtra highlights the urgent need
to refine and extend irrigated crop production techniques. The traditional farming
system of planting the main crops late in the monsoon, even if the crop is supple-
mented with rabi irrigation, is a response to the present production environment,
which is not conducive to high productivity systems. As indicated, intensified
production systems suitable to the project area have been identified and operated
successfully under experimental stations and progressive farmers' conditions. The
problem is how to adapt them quickly to average farm conditions. This would require
concentrating a critical mass of multidisciplinary experts. Consequently, it is
proposed to constitute a team of specialists to assist with the introduction of
intensive irrigated agriculture into the project area. The specific subjects which
they would investigate would include:
(a) refining cultural practices, including land preparation and an irrigation
regime, for the crops to be grown, particularly the high-value crops, now
only grown on small scale with less than optimal farming techniques;



-17-
(b) developing and testing farming systems and crop sequences that ensure fanrm
production levels commensurate with the necessary infrastructure investments;
(c) identifying appropriate border length and width for soils of different clay
content, bearing in mind the stream size;
(d) developing the right kind of operating regimes for the distributaries and
minors, commensurate with an optimal field irrigation regime for the crops
grown; and
(e) identifying and establishing the most suitable and feasible farmer organiza-
tions to ensure equitable vater use and maintenance of field channels, field
drains and their structures.
(f) designing and testing animal-drawn implements that can perform the operations
necessary to ensure optimal crop development;
The innovative asd challenging character of the tasks to be undertaken by this team
and the high expectations from the results of its operations will necessitate its
support by the most competent professionals that can be recruited.
3.22    The venue of this work would initially be the SDDs, but as soon as proven,
well-tested results emerge, the team would extend its activities to training
appropriately qualified extension workers and to visiting farmers in their fields.
Terms of reference for the specialists are in Annex 4, along with the suggested work
programe. The project costs include the necessary financial and material support
for this component.
3.23    To furnish the necessary expertise and plans, it would be necessary to:
(a) have a full-time special technical team, consisting of an agricultural
engineer, agronomist, a part-time (6 months per year) agricultural economist,
and an irrigation expert, equivalent in GOM's civil service hierarchy to a
Superintending Engineer, Deputy Director of Agriculture or Associate Profes-
sor of a University, to work during the 5 years of project implementation on
problems related to their disciplines, first in the SDDs, and later on in
other parts of the project, in an advisory capacity to the team members of
the project;
(b) recruit consultants (if required to support the team under (a)] the same
disciplines to train and advise the special technical team for an aggregate
period of not less than 50 man-months, spread over four years; and
(c) ensure that the members of the special technical team trained in the
appropriate disciplines are not reassigned unless suitable replacements are
appointed.
An agreement has been reached with GON that it would (i) by December 31, 1985 prepare
special technical services working plans, acceptable to the Bank Group, for implemen-
tation in the project and in the SDDs; (ii) by January 31, 1986 assign to CADA and
its agencies and departments concerned a full-time special technical team, with
suitable qualifications and experiences to carry out the special technical services
(para 9.02[d]).



-18-
3.24    Regarding the recruitment of consultants (para 3.23 [b]), an agreement has
been reached with GOB that it would employ consultants whose qualifications,
experience and teDms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Associa-
tion.  Such consultants would be selected in accordance with principles and proce-
dures satisfactory to IDA (para 9.02 [el).
3.25    Agricultural Extension support of the project by AD would be adequate once
the proposed reorganization at the field and subdivision level has taken place (para
2.17). However, to enable the additional staff to vork effectively, they would
require housing, office space, vehicles and other equipment not normally provided for
staff posted to established villages. Accordingly, provisions have been made for
construction of houses for all VEWs and AOs assigned to the area, office space for
any nev subdivision that has to be established because of the higher staffing density
and the proposed reorientation of the service (paras 5.26-5.27), and for the PAO who
would head up the agricultural extension district that would cover the project area
(para 5.26).
C. Design. Construction and Implementation Criteria
ID Construction Wing Works
3.26    Water Supply and Demand (Annex 1, Table 25a and b). The yield of the Sind-
phanA river at Majalgaon available in 3 out of 4 years is estimated at 403 Nm33 with
allowance made for existing and future upstream irrigaiion developments. The yield
from Paithan at the 75% level is estimated at 2,578 Mm , taking into account the
existence of 6 Major, 4 Medium, and 28 Minor irrigation projects above the dan. To
improve and update the hydrological data and optimize the operation of the overall
system, agreements have been reached with GON that a hydrological flow model would be
developed by the operational unit of the project (para 9.02 [c]). Crop water
requirements were computed using the Modified Penman method. The conveyance
efficiency is estimated at 75% (based on canal losses of 2 cfs/msft), the field
efficiency at 65Z, making the overall efficiency 49%.
3.27    Dam Safety.  The Majalgaon dam was designed by the Central Design Organiza-
tion of GOM and reviewed by CWC. Acceptable techniques for foundation investigation,
design and construction were used. The spillway capacity is based on standard Prob-
able Maximum Flood (PEF) criteria. A small self contained hydro-electric plant will
operate the spillway gates; they can be manually operated in case of emergency.
3.28    A Dam Safety Directorate of independent experts, satisfactory to the Bank
Group, has been appointed by GON in 1979 to review plans and inspect the construction
works of all new Bank-financed dams built in Mabarashtra and financed by the Bank. A
Dam Safety Panel has reviewed the plans of Iajalgaon dam before construction started.
Agreement has been reached with GOM that, in accordance vith sound engineering prac-
tices, it will cause the Dam Safety Directorate to inspect: (i) on January 1 of each
year, commencing on January 1, 1986, the Hajalgaon Dam and its related structures,
and (ii) each five years, on January 1, commencing on January 1, 1986K  the Paithan
Dam and its related structures to determine whether there are any deficiencies in the
condition of such structure, or in the quality and adequacy of maintenance or methods
of operation of the ame, which may endanger their safety (para 9.02 Ef]).
3.29    Rotational Water Supply C(RWS) and Design Principles.  The project is designed
to operate on the rigid Shejpali system (Chapter VI). The main and branch canals are
sized to provide the maximum irrigation requirement by continuous flow. During peak
demand in the rabi and hot seasons, farmers will receive water at 14-day intervals



-19-
with each distributary being rotated 7 days on and 7 days off.. The capacity of the
rotated distributaries will be twice the average flow.
3.30    Desian of the canal network. Because of the variable flow throughout the
system, a high degree of control will be provided. Cross regulators will be con-
structed at all nodes in the main and branch canals and in the distributaries to
allow control over supply levels to the outlets at all stages. Radial gates will be
used for the main and branch canals. Hovable weir gates will be used in the dis-
tributaries and gated pipes in the outlets to the chaks.
3.31    The main, branch, distributary and minor canals will all be designed with
least cost sections and be fully lined following a design criteria similar to that
used in both MCIP I and MCIP II between 1977-84. Chak size will be close to 24 ha
and field channels will be aligned along ridges and field boundaries as far as pos-
sible, and selectively lined for protection of structures and vulnerable sections.
Lining specifications will be as follows:
Main Canal:             10cm M 100 grade in situ concrete with 100cm cohesive
non-swelling (CNS) backing;
Distributaries:         25-250 cfs: 7.5 cm M 100 grade in situ concrete with 60 cm
CNS backing
Minors:                 < 25 cfs:  5x60x60 cm N 100 grade precast
slabs in sides over 60 cm CNS and 5 cm CNS in bed laid
over 30 cm CNS backing
< 5 cfs: lining PCC slabs 5 cm thick over 30 cm CNS backing
in sides and 20 cm CNS backing in bed.
Field Channels:         Selective protection (about 20% of total length) with
either precast or cast in situ lining for the
folloving cases:
- the slope is greater than 1/800 11
- the canal reaches build on embankment
- 5 m upstream and downstream of structures
- at bends and 5 m on both sides
3.32    Each chak outlet will be provided with either a measuring device or a limit-
ing device. The limiting device is a lined section of the field channel just below
the outlet gate, which is provided with a side weir; all flows greater than 1 cffs are
bypassed over the weir. There is thus no incentive to tamper with the gate to obtain
extra flow.
3.33    Drainage.  Drainage will be required in all areas.  Provisions have been made
for main and link drains to connect the chak drainage to the natural drains (nullabs
and rivers). Great care in design will be needed to avoid the main drainage systems
A survey of existing field channels will be done to confirm this
criteria.

from developing into erosion gulleys. Bed controls will be needed at drainage out-
falls. The drainage will be designed to remove within 48 hours a 1:20 years storm.
3.34    Roads. The program provides for the upgrading and construction of rural
roads in the project area to common standards established by GOM. The network deu-
sity is planned to provide all-weather access within 3 kms of any part of the
irrigated area and to all villages with a population of more than 1500 within the
commands. Design standards will be as follows;
(a) construction of only narrow roads (3.5 m width with a surfacing of waterbound
macadam);
(b)  no black topping; and
(c) construction of hard passages instead of bridges over nullahs that only flow
sporadically.
The subgrade design strictly adheres to the requirements dictated by traffic and
foundation California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values (a worldwide standard accepted in
India).
CAD Works
3.35    Design Criteria for Landshapinz.  Even water distribution within the field is
a major pre-requisite for attaining the yield potential of annual crops. This
requires earthmoving on all but a few locations. Given the rolling topography of the
project area and the nature and depth of its soil, the amount of soil to be moved can
be considerable and its moving difficult. Permissible cuts have to be carefully
determined to leave enough topsoil to avoid serious yield reduction following
landshaping.
3.36    The ID's standard to shape the land to a longitudinal slope of 0.6Z and a
cross slope of 0.2% will be followed. The method of irrigation recommended is border
strips, about 5 m wide and 30 m long. Experience has shown that the slopes adopted
are correct; however, the length and width of borders recommended will be refined
according to the clay content of the soil and the size of the water stream entering
the field. This would be established by the proposed technical support team, and if
necessary introduced thereafter as recommended design criteria to the project.
Construction Methods
3.37    Work on the distributaries will be divided into suitable reaches and each
tender will include earthworks, lining and structures, thus avoiding coordination
problems between contractors. The works will be grouped to allow maximum participa-
tion by large contractors. Most of the earthworks will be done by manual labor but
in difficult sections where rock or deep cuts are encountered, or where large amounts
of material require compaction, departmental equipment will be made available. All
works below the chak outlet will be labour intensive except landshaping. About 80%
of the landshaping will be done mechanically because the available labor is insuffi-
cient to complete the program manually. To speed up landshaping, 50 light bulldozers
are to be purchased under the project.



-21-
Status of Project Preparation
3.38    The major civil works in the Jayakwadi area are aimed at adding missing
elements and/or upgrading of the standard of existing elements. Detailed surveys and
designs for the canal lining works are available and plans for roads and drainage
systems are well advanced. For the Majalgaon area the major civil works would start
in 1985, including the distributary system for the first two segments (up to km 100)
most of which has been surveyed and preliminary layouts completed. Cost estimates of
the distributaries are based on detailed designs of sample areas. ID, with the
support of PWD, has sufficient capacity to produce designs for the works of the new
distributaries and minors, and the drainage and road networks required.  The CADA of
Jayakwadi and Parbhani. together with MLDC, have a proven ability to design and
construct 16,000 ha of CAD works per year, including field channels, field drains,
field channel protection, and landshaping. Provision has been made to train the
additional cadres needed to complete the 30,000 ha per year required under the
project. Proper balance would be maintained between MbnC, CADA, ID Construction Wing
and PWD works, and the annual budgets will be allocated to each accordingly. The
tendency to give priorities to major civil works should be avoided.
Proiect Implementation Schedule (Chart 1)
3.39    All the works in Jayakwadi Command are to be completed under the project
(1985-89). In Majalgaon Command, only the dam and the first segment (km 0 to
30-24,000 ha) are to be fully completed, while for the second segment (km 31 to
100-33,000 ha) a substantial part of the civil works would be completed, but none of
CADA-s works. The vorks not completed, and the full development of the last segment
(km 101 to 165--43,000 ha) are scheduled for 1990-94, the final fourth stage of the
project (see Annex 1, Table 8).
IV.  COST ESTIMATES AND FINA5NCIAL ARIANGEISB
Cost Estimates (Annex 1, Tables 4 to 14)
4.01    Estimated project costs would total Rs 3,872 H (US$322.7 K).  Ongoing works
for completion of the Majalgaon Dam and Main Canal totalling US$66.4 M are not
included in this estimate. Cost estimates based on expected April 1985 prices are
summarized as follows:

-22-
4.02    Physical contingencies were estimated at 15% for construction works
and average 13% of the base-costs.  Price contingencies, which account for
about 192 of total project costs, were based on expected inflation rates of
8.5% per year for local expenditures and 8% for 1985, 9% for 1986, 1987, and
1988, and 7.5% thereafter for foreign expenditures. Taxes and duties
included in the cost estimates are negligible.
Finaucinz
4.03    Tue proposed credit of US$160 X would finance the foreign exchange
component (US$33.2 M) and about 44% of local costs. All expenditures would
be met by GOM from its development budget, which includes a GOI contribution.
GOM has allocated adequate funds under the 7th Plan for the project. The IDA
credit would be on standard IDA terms. Agreements have been reached with GOI
that it will make the proceeds of the credit available to GOM on GOI's stand-
ard terms and arrangements for development assistance to the State (para 9.01
[b). Further, an agreement has been reached with GON that it will it would
promptly provide resources and funds to execute the project in accordance
with the project implementation and expenditure program (para 9.02 [g]).
Retroactive financing, not exceeding US$5.0 M, would be provided for
qualified expenditures incurred after September 1, 1984.
Procurement
4.04    Civil Works.  Major works, other than CADA, financed under the
project (about 60% of the total cost) would cost about US$194.6 M, including
physical and price contingencies, but excluding land acquisition, engineer-
ing, and administration costs. Works will be packaged whenever practicable
to attract competition from large contractors yet bids would be allowed on
parts of the package to encourage smaller contractors to participate as well.
Approximately US$25.0 M worth of the works, most of which on the main and
branch canal system of Majalgaon, would exceed US$6.0 M per package and be
procured under ICB procedures. Approximately US$111.3 4 worth of works on
various sites, would cost between US$25,000 and US$6.0 X per package and
would be procured under LCB procedures. The CADA works, totalling US$83.3 X,
would be scattered over the entire project area and, for operational reasons,
would have to be awarded at different times. None of the CADA contracts
would exceed US$0.5 M and about US$45.4 M will be procured under LCB proce-
dures. Bank Group approved work-order 1/ type bidding procedures will be
used on small contracts costing equivalent or less than US$25,000 each, up to
an aggregate of US$32.6 1. For safety and logistic reasons, or where it will
be impracticable to draw up a specification, up to an aggregate of US$63.6 M,
may be accomplished with departmental forces.
4.05    Equipment and Vehicles totalling about Rs 69.6 K (US$5.8 M), including
physical and price contingencies, are included in the project (see Annex 1,
sJ An Indian system of public tendering for minor works.



-23-
Tables 9, 11, 13a and 13b). Items totalling about Rs 61.2 v (US$5.1 M) would
be grouped in appropriate bidding packages costing each US$100,000 or more, and
procured through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Qualified domestic manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evaluation
of 15X, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, and bid documents would
specify their eligibility and the manner of application of the preference.
Light equipment and vehicles estimated to total about RB  7.2 M (US$0.6 1) are
readily available domestically. Because of the need for servicing and spare
parts facilities, considerable advantages would be derived from procuring
locally manufactured light equipment and vehicles. These goods would be
procured under LCB procedures satisfactory to Bank Group.

4.06    Contract Review.  All bidding packages for works estimated to cost Rs 6 M
(US$0.5 H) or more, and all ICB packages for goods, would be subject to the Bank
Group's pre-action review of the procurement documents and procedures. Such packages
would account for about 45Z of the total estimated value of civil works, and 89Z of
goods procurement. The balance of civil works contracts and all CADA contracts would
be subject to random post-action review by the Bank Group.
4.07    Standard Bid Documents and GOM Special Tender Committee.  The Central Water
Commission of GOI has developed model ICB and LCB bidding documents and procedures
for both works and goods procurement. The model documents and procedures with any
modifications which may be required by the Bank Group, would be used by GOM for
procurement under the project.

Disbursements
4.08    Disbursements under the credit would be made against:
(a) Civil works-55Z of expenditures on main canals, distributary canals
and minors, main and link drainage, roads, field channels, field
channel protection, field drains, landshaping;
(b) Vehicles and equipment:
(i) directly imported-100% of foreign expenditures;
(ii)  locally manufactured-lOOX of ex-factory costs;
(iii)  other locally procured-70Z;           -
(c) Monitoring and evaluation, housing and offices for agricultural
staff, and Specially Developed Distributary (including salaries and
allowances for incremental staff)-70Z;
(d) Special surveys, training programs, special technical services and
study tours-1OOZ.
Disbursement requests for civil works would be made against certificates of expendi-
ture submitted by GOM, itemized by project component. Disbursements for OFD works
excluding landshaping within a chak would only be made upon completion.  Disbursement
requests for such work would be submitted together with a completion certifi:cate duly
signed by the AE in charge, stating that all works in the chak have been completed in
accordance with the agreed planning and design criteria. Disbursements for landshap-
ing will be made for fields completed according to CADA specifications. Disbursements
for payments of less than Rs 300,000 for works (including departmental works) or Rs
150,000 for goods, incremental staff cost for training, adaptive and engineering
research, monitoring and evaluation and the costs for the special surveys and study
tours would be against certificates of expenditures. Documentation for these works
would be retained by GOM and made available for inspection by the Bank Group during
review missions. Full documentation would be required for all other disbursements.
4.09    The estimated schedule of expenditures, the semiannual disbursement schedule
and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit are presented in Annex 1,
Tables 15, 16, and 17, respectively. The disbursement profile is based on the 3rd to
8th year of Indian irrigation sector disbursement profiles. It is expected that
disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1990.
Accounts and Audits
4.10    The project would be subject to normal government control and auditing proce-
dures that are satisfactory. A resident audit officer, representing the state
accountant general, would audit project accounts. Separate accounts would be main-
tained for project expenditures. Although continuous and annual audits are carried
out in a timely manner, their finalization is a lengthy process in the Statutory
Audit Report presented to the legislature. It would be essential, therefore, to have
interim certified statements of account including audited statements of expenditures.
Such statements, certified by the accountant general or his designee and supported
by an itemized account and summary of expenditures, would be submitted to the Bank



-25-
Group as soon as possible but no more than six months after the end of each
fiscal year. Agreement has been reached with GOM that it would (i) maintain
separate records and accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting
principles and procedures, its resources, expenditures and operations related
to the project; (ii) furnish to the Association copies of accounts and finan-
cial statements for each year, certified as to their accuracy and authen-
ticity by an independent auditor acceptable to the Association, not later
than nine months after the end of each fiscal year; (iii) have accounts and
financial statements for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank Group; (iv) furnish to the Bank Group immediately
following its finalization, the report of such audit in such detail as the
Bank Group shall reasonably request; {v) furnish to the Bark Group any other
information as it shall reasonably request (para 9.02 [hl).
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01    Under the project, the major emphasis would shift from large
infrastructure works now taken by the Construction Win& of the Irrigation
Department (ID), to on-farm development, which is the responsibility of CADA
Win2 of ID and provision of agricultural services to the benefiting farmers
to be rendered mainly by the Agriculture (AD) and the Cooperative (CD)
Departments. This new emphasis would be reflected in the proposed project
organization. CADA, together with the proposed new agricultural extension
district of the Agriculture Department would have the major role in executing
increasing amounts of project works, providing reliable and timely water
supply, and would provide more technical and managerial support than hitherto
to enhance agricultural production. Special managerial and logistical effort
would be provided to the Specially Developed Distributaries (SDDs) to be
established under the project.
The Irrigation Department-
5.02    The overall organization of the Irrigation Department is shown in
Chart No. 2. The senior position in the department is held by the Secretary
of Irrigation, who is in charge of studies, planning, implementation, opera-
tion and maintenance of all irrigation projects in the State. The Secretary
and Commissioner of CADA is equal in seniority to tbe Secretary, Irrigation;
the CADA regional circles operate under his control.
5.03    The Irrigation Department was the sole organization in the State to
deal with irrigation until the mid-1970s, with focus on construction and O&M
activities. With the establishment of CADA other aspects of irrigated
agriculture, like agricultural support services and on-farm development were
taken up in cooperation with other government departments. However, con-
struction continued to get a major share of the funds. Sixteen Chief
Engineers (CE) are heading the central and regional offices of ID, none of
which are in CADA. These offices are in charge of preparation, planning,
design, implementation and O&M of all irrigation projects in the state. CADA
takes part only in some of the completed projects, and there, beside its role
as a coordinator, takes up on-farm development below the Government outlet
and the O&M of the systems after completion for a currently undetermined
period.



-26-
5.04    The Jayakvadi/Majalgaon project is presently managed by the Chief
Engineer, Special ProJects in Aurangabad, who sponsors all construction
activities in the region.  Although officially the CADA Administrator is not
under his control and CADA should take over parts of the project once con-
struction is completed, his seniority ensures him to remain the dominant
figure of the project.
The-Command-Area DeveloDment-Authorities (CADA-)
5.05    CADA in Maharashtra.  CADA, which was created to speed up utilization
of the irrigation potential created by the projects, is in effect a coor-
dinating body during project implementation. A State Cabinet Subcommittee
directs its policy. The CAnA Commissioner, who is Secretary of the
Sub-Committee, is responsible for preparing annual development and financial
plans. The plans are worked out im conjunction with the Secretaries of
Finance, Agriculture, Irrigation, Public Works, and other ministries involved
in CADA schemes. There are 13 CADAs in the State, each headed by an
Administrator, with the rank of SE, supported by divisions, subdivisions and
sections. The Administrator is in charge of coordinating the activities of
all entities involved in the area. He is assisted by officers seconded from
other departments: (i) the Irrigation Department completes all construction
down to the outlet (24 ha), drainage network (main and link) and service
roads; (ii) the Agriculture Department renders technical advice; (iii) the
Public Works Department constructs and maintains the command area roads; and
(iv) the Cooperative Department coordinates the supply of credit, seeds,
fertilizers, and pesticides. Each CADA Administrator has, at least on paper,
a single line of control over the works of the different disciplines involved
in the project but in practice can be overruled by the regional CE of ID.
5.06    CADA Orzanization in tre- Proiect--Area.  The first CADA in the project
area was established in 1975, and covered the Jayakwadi and Pumna projects.
In 1981, a separate CADA was established for Purna. As the workload of
Jayakwadi's CADA continued to grow, especially with MWIP, a new unit, headed
by a Superintending Engineer, was established in 1983, with headquarters in
Parbhani, to handle land development for the entire Jayakwadi/Majalgaon
complex; however, normal CADA responsibilities continue to lie with the
Jayakwadi CADA Administrator. Under this arrangement, the construction of
the OFD works-except land development-and subsequent management, operation
and maintenance, are the responsibility of the CADA Administrator, whose
headquarters are in Aurangabad. He is responsible to an Executive Committee
(EC) comprised of regional heads of departments, members of the Legislative
Assembly and farmers' representatives. MWUP, which is totally under CADA,
includes, however, some works above the outlets, normally taken up by the
Construction Wing of ID. This is expected to change with the rapid expansion
of CADA's responsibilities (para 5.09).
5.07    The Administrator in Aurangabad directs the work of a team consisting
of Deputy Administrator (Engineering), a Deputy Director of Agriculture, an
Assistant Administrator of the Revenue Department, Accountant Officers of
Finance Department, a Deputy Registrar of the Cooperative Department and a
Statistician of the Economics and Statistics Department. A Technical Cell
provides the necessary technical support and quality control, and a Monitor-
ing Cell monitors the activities in each of the project sections (see
Chart 3).



-27-
5.08    Because major irrigation projects-except Jayakwadi/Majalgaon--are
relatively small and a typical Maharashtra CADA covers less than 100,000 ha,
its Administrator is of the level of SE. His staff is correspondingly small,
with limited slots for professionals. Because of the vast area under the
project, its rapid expected development and the intricate multidisciplinary
activities to be carried out simultaneously in different locations, much
strongeT managerial capability and authority should be given to the Jayak-
wadi/Majalgaon CADA. GOM is considering to upgrade the position of CADA
Administrator in Aurangabad to the rank of CE, thereby enabling him to con-
trol the project as a whole and at the same time administer the various parts
and disciplines of the project more effectively. Under the upgraded CADA
Administrator, four sub-commands (or units), each to be headed by an SE,
would be established and given enough support and authority to carry out
and/or coordinate all development programs within their units. Accordingly,
an agreement has been reached with GOM that by December 31, 1985, the post of
CADA Administrator in charge of the Jayakwadi/Majalgaon scheme will be
upgraded to the rank of Chief Engineer and that four sub-commands will be
established in the project area (para 9.02 [i]).
5.09    Design and Construction of OFD.  All survey, design, planning,
procurement and construction activities of OFD are carried out by the
appropriate divisions, subdivisions and sections supervised by the Deputy
Administrator (Engineering) of GADA. Additional divisions would be estab-
lished under the project to cover the new units and activities. However,
CADA is presently overloaded with construction works, more since it has been
ch.'rged with coordinating all MWUP works in Jayakwadi. Some of the design
and construction works presently implemented by CADA, like the completion of
distributaries and minors in the first two segments of Jayakwadi, and the
construction of main and link drainage systems over the two commands, would
be transferred to ID's CE in Aurangebad, whose other works ere slowing down
as the project approaches its final stage of construction. consequently, the
burden on CADA staff would be eased and they would be able to concentrate
their efforts more on OFD works, support to the farmers, accelerated develop-
ment of the SDDs, day-to-day management and establishment of appropriate O&M
on the two commAnds.
5.10    Quality Control and Commissioning.  Both CADA and the Construction
Wing of CE have their technical units that exercise quality control in the
project area. CADA, whose scope of works is larger and more scattered
although cheaper than that of the Construction Wing, would use the latter's
technical expertise, laboratories and equipment, but should have its own
quality control field staff. Specific duties of the EEs and the Assistant
Engineers (AEs) in CADA have been defined. Inspection books and chak
registers would be maintained to report and monitor observations. The Tech-
nical Unit, which is also in charge of quality control, would allocate ade-
quate staff, prepare annual schedules and carry out on a regular basis sys-
tematic random spot checks in all parts of the project. With respect to
quality of irrigation network and OFD works, the statistical design and
frequency of quality checks will be such that it will enable to quantify the
quality of project works through estimates (means) having confidence limits
of  10% at 95% probability level. It will have control of:
'a) physical works including earthvorks, concrete and gate fabrication;
(b) design, with particular reference to co-ordinating main system and
chak design;



-28-
Similar provision wi11 be taken up by the technical unit of the Construction
Wing, Anrangabad, which, besides carrying out its routine quality control
assignments, will support CADA. Accordingly, agreement has been reached with
GOM that it would take all actions, as shall be necessary, to ensure adequate
quality control by CADA (and ID) of surveys, planning, design, construction
and O&M activities (para 9.02 [j]).
5.11    To ensure that the works will be properly completed, and that the
concerned Outlet Committees (OCs) and Minor Water Utilization Committees
(i[UCs) can be entrusted with the responsibility for 0OK, water allocations
and sanctioning, GON undertook to (i) test and certify that the field irriga-
tion drainage channels, service roads and landshaping within the chak have
been carried out in accordance with agreed planning design and construction
standards and criteria and, thereafter, entrust the pertinent outlet and
Minor Water Utilization Committees (para 5.22) vith the responsibility of
operating and maintaining such upgraded field irrigation and drainage chan-
nels and maintaining such service roads; (ii) take all such action as shall
be required to ensure that such farmers- organizations shall properly operate
and maintain such field irrigation and drainage channels and maintain such
service roads; and (iii) promptly repair and maintain the field irrigation,
drainage channels and service roads at farmers- cost, in case such works are
not promptly carried out by the concerned farmers' organizations.
5.12    Engineerini Staff TraininR.  To ensure the implementation of the
works to the agreed standards it would be essential that the engineering
staff working on on-farm development (OFD) be trained by WALMI, and/or by
CADAs' own training facilities. The WALMI can meet part of the overall
demand; the rest can be met through special short training courses in WALMI
and by CADA (paras 6.08-6.10).
5.13    Operation and Maintenance. Responsibility for the day-to-day opera-
tion of the canal system up to the chak outlets in Jayakwadi/lajalgaon rests
presently with CADA, although eventually the O&M Wing of ID will take it
over. Agreement has been reached with GOM that it would operate and maintain
adequately the distributaries, minors, drainage channels, link drains, serv-
ice roads and buildings constructed under the project, according to sound
engineering principles and standards, and provide sufficient funds to enable
such operation and maintenance to be carried out (para 9.02 [k]). For pur-
poses of operating the irrigation systems under the project according to
sound engineering principles and standards, CADA would carry out an annual
survey of the required repairs in each irrigation system and execute repairs
promptly.
5.14    Operation and maintenance within the chaks will be the responsibility
of the Outlet Committees COCs). Strong efforts would be made by GOM to
ensure that the OCs cause their members properly to maintain, or pay for
maintaining their field channels. However, GOM undertook to cause CADA to
repair and maintain the field irrigation and drainage channels at farmers'
costs, wherever the maintenance works performed by the OCs are not up to
sound engineering standards, and provide the necessary facilities for that
purpose.

5.15    ahbarashtra-liand- Deveo Cment- orporation {WMDC).  To support and
promote landshaping, farmers were encouraged to apply for loans from commer-
cial banking sources who are able to refinance through NABARD 75Z of the sum
lent if the applicant bad a clear repayment record. Such applicants pay
10.25X interest. For farmers not eligible for commercial bank loans, funds
for anfdshaping came from a Special Loan Account (SL&) with 13.8% interest
(para 7.11)_ To channel these loans and organize works not taken up by the
farmers, the Maharashtra Land Development Corporation (IwDC) was established,
with headquarters in Pone. MLDC has an annual capacity to organize and
administer about 25,000 ha of landshaping per annum in all CADA areas, as
demonstrated by their achievements during the last five years. The 1984-85
program of NLDC contemplates work of some 45,000 ha, one-third of which in
Jayakwadi, which, in the light of past achievements, seems entirely feasible.
With minor strengthening, MLDC will be capable of handling financial assis-
tance for landshaping envisaged under the project.
5.16    Ways of !mplementation. Landshaping has proved to be a key factor
to ensure satisfactory levels of field irrigation efficiency and to attain
the productivity levels assumed under the project. It is expected that it
will be implemented in one of three ways: (a) by farmers, using their own
resources and not seeking technical advice; (b) by farmers who seek technical
advice but without financial support; (c) by farmers who seek technical,
financial and implementation assistance, in which case works will be
organized by MLDC and executed by CADA.
5.17    Farmers usims entirely their own initiative would be assisted with
free plans and their completed work would be checked whether it conforms to
the overall chak plan.
5.1 8    Farmers who-seek-technical-assistance- only would have their fields
marked for cut and fill by CAsA's landshaping division, who, on completion
of the work, would re-survey the plots and, if necessary, would indicate any
additional work required. This service, being entirely of an advisory
nature, would be provided as part of the project, free of charge. The
farmers would have access, at nominal charge, to metal scraperboards for
animal draft, and graders, scrapers and rear blades suitable for farm trac-
tors equipped with standard 3-point linkage; CADA would maintain a stock of
these items.
5.19    landsapin -n beha-If-of-the-farmer. This part of the work is
expected to account for about 90X of all landshaping. Work would begin after
an agreement with farmers on financing and timing has been reached. The
implementing agency would be CADA. They may use EGS manual labor, engage
farmers with their oxen or farm tractors for which they would provide
suitable attachments, or use their own mechanical equipment. On completion
of the work CADA would provide the farmer with a document showing that the
land had been shaped to satisfactory standards. This document would be the
farmer's certification, and could be used as evidence if the work turns out
to be deficient.
5.20    Finajcg-.  Landshaping is relatively expeusive (Rs 3-4,000/ha) and
as its speedy execution is important to realize the expected project
benefits, the money (Rs 13-18,000 per farm) must be spent over a short
period.  Consequently many farmers would require financial assistance for



-30-
landshaping. The main sources of such assistance were to be the institu-
tionai credit system (Commercial and Land Development Banks) and the SL& that
vas set up by GOI, GOM and NARARD, and out of which farmers not eligible for
regular bank loans could borrow for landshaping. However, as indicated
(para 2.25), institutional credit sources are severely constrained due to
poor recovery of past loans. Despite that, the demand for SLA loans has been
low, largely because of the restrictive lending terms. The financial
analysis of representative farm models (Anner 1, Tables 29 [a] and 29 (b])
indicates that many farmers would not be able to repay their loans under the
prevailing lending terms, especially in view of the temporary decline in
productivity following landshaping (para 7.11). The SLA is too small to
cover expected needs under the project. To overcome financial and technical
constraints, an understanding has been reached with GOM that it would:
(a) cause CADA to (i) prepare and furnish to the farmers benefiting from
the Proje^t, free of charge, an overall plan and detailed plans
(including irrigation and drainage facilities) for carrying out the
landshaping; (ii) provide, free of charge, any additional technical
assistance that may be requested by farmers for purposes of carrying
out the landshaping activities under the project;
(b) make available to MLDC all funds requized to enable CADA to make
landshaping loans, under terms and conditions identical to those made
under the SLA, to farmers wishing to undertake landshaping and vho
are not eligible for obtaining loans from other sources on similar or
better terms; provided, however, that the amount of any such loan
shall not exceed Rs 3,000 per hectare of the area to be landshaped
to a maximum loan amount, per farmer, of Rs 30,000;
Cc) make adequate arrangements for the full recovery of the principal,
interest and other charges of the landshaping loans made by NLDC;
and
,d) cause MnLC to maintain special records for each farmer benefiting
under this provision and transfer them on completion of works to the
Land Revenue authorities for recovery, with arrears to be treated as
arrears on land revenue.
To support the foregoing understandings, an agreement has been reached with
GOM that it would (a) take all such action as shall be necessary, including
provision of funds, to enable MLDC to provide loans to farmers for purposes
of carrying out, through CADA, the landshaping of their fields; and (b) make
adequate arrangements for the recovery of the funds so onlent (para
9.02l]).
5.21    In view of the fact that present terms for landshaping loans would
appear not to give a long enough grace period and also may predicate loan
repayment at a rate that would sizeably reduce farmers' incomes and thereby
act as a disincentive, an agreement has been reached with GON that it would
carry out a socio-economic study, to be completed not later than by December
31, 1986, to assess the capacity of farmers to repay landshaping loans and
use its recommendations to revise the lending terms for landshaping loans,
including those made prior to the said review (para 9.02 [m).

Farmers Ortanizations
5.22    Farmers organizations would be set up in the project area at three
levels (at the cbak, minor and distributary/branch, or main channel level) to
maximize their involvement in project operation and to improve communications
with the operating staff (para 5.11). Farmers would be able to convey com-
plaints, requests and suggestions to CADA through these organizations. Coor-
dination between the three levels is assured as each comprises both farmers'
leaders and CADA officials. The CADA Executive Committee, which also
includes faxmers' representatives, would oversee the performance of these
local committees. The proposed organization is similar to what is being
established under MWUP which covers only 14Z of the project area. Although
operating only since late 1983, indications are that the various committees
will, when fully established, be effective, if given appropriate advice and
support.
(a) Outlet Committee (OCs) would be organized for each chak to maintain
field channels, distribute water according to RWS schedules, and
prevent unauthorized irrigation. The irrigation schedules would be
prepared by the O&H section of each sub-command, and displayed on
signboards near the chak outlet well in advance of actual water
delivery. Each OC would have five to seven members: two farmers on
each field channel, one tail ender on each field channel, and the
responsible Canal Inspector (CI) and VEW. A farmer leader, elected
by the chaks farmers and the CI, would serve as secretary. The OCs
would be formed as soon as the chak boundaries have been determined
and would be consulted on the most appropriate layout of field chan-
nels, location of farm outlets and crossings, and constraints in the
present system.
(b) Water Utilization Committees (WUCs) (locally known as Water Panchayat
Committee) would be organized for each minor. WUC membership would
comprise of five farmer leaders (out of which two would be small
landholders and/or tail enders), the CI, and the JE. Initially, the
WUC would only monitor the irrigation schedules prepared by the O&M
sub-command section, process complaints and seek appropriate solu-
tions. However, GOM's final aim is that the WUCs should become fully
responsible for water distribution anong the chaks on a minor since
the many outlets on a minor are a heavy burden for CADA's O&M
organization. The irrigation schedules for the chaks would be dis-
played at the head of the minor.
(c) Canal Advisory Committees (CACs) would be set up for areas under the
jurisdiction of the EE covering 40,000 ha or less. Five to ten
members of the WUC would be elected to the CAC. The EE would be the
head of the CAC; the Agricultural Development Officer, the Assistant
Engineer, Planning Officer of the Zilla Parishad and a representative
of the local sugar factories would also be members. The CAC would
develop the irrigation programs, monitor the performance of the main
system, identify deficiencies and make suggestions for improvements.
Agreement has been reached with GOM that it would establish suitable farmers'
organizations in each of the project command areas in accordance with a plan
satisfactory to GOX and the 8ank Group (para 9.02 (nu).



-32-
Establishment of a Proiect Steerin, Committee
5.23    As indicated, accelerated agricultural production is the main
project objective. The four SDDs which will demonstrate accelerated multi-
facet development will spearhead agricultural development efforts. For
tffective implementation, policy decisions and co-ordination wouLd have to be
made at a high level, to ensure the success of these distributaries and the
rapid diffusion of their results all over the project area. It is therefore
proposed to set up a Project Steering Committee to review progress and
provide guidance to the CAD& Administrator who will be in charge of
day-to-day execution and operation.
5.24    As proposed by GOM, the Steering Committee would consist of: (a)
Secretary, Irrigation Department (Chairman) (b) Commissioner, Comuand Area
Development Authority; (c) Director of Agriculture, Maharashtra State,
(d) Chief Engineer (Special Projects) Aurangabad; (e) Joint Director of
Agriculture (T&V), Anrangabad; (f) Director of Research Parbhani University,
(g) Administrator, CADA, Aurangabad (Member, Secretary). Additional members
may be coopted at the Chairman's discretion.
5.25    The Committee would meet once in three months and review the program,
progress and results of the project with emphasis, during the first 2-3
years, on the SDDs. The Committee would seek expert advice on management,
agriculture, sociology, monitoring, and other pertinent issues. Modifica-
tions in the plan of operation would be made from time to time as the need
for them arises, duly considering the experts' opinions and advice. The
Committee shall thus guide the administrator in the execution of the SDDs,
shall be closely involved in their developments, and shall propose strategies
and ways to spread the results promptly to other areas (para 3.18). Agree-
ment has been reached with GOM that it would establish the Steering Committee
by April 30, 1985, with the powers and functions outlined above (para
9.02 [b]).
The Department of Acriculture (AD)
5.26    Overall organization of the Department of Agriculture (AD) is shown
in Chart No. 4 and its current extension and research activities are
described in paras 2.17 and 2.18.
5.27    Aaricultural Extension.  Changes in the extension organization would
ensure that all staff dealing with technical, supply and administrative
problems in the project area will have no, or minimal, responsibilities
outside the project area. This would be achieved by establishing two new
agricultural districts specifically for the project area; the boundaries will
take into account that villages are situated, respectively, north and south
of the canals and their farmers have land inside and outside the commanded
area. All staff posted to these districts would be of the regular cadre of
the Department of Agriculture. The staffing intensity would be 1 VEW per 800
farmers and the existing proportion of upper level staff to VEWs would be
maintained. Housing for staff, office space, and necessary equipment would
be provided out of project funds. Accordingly, an agreement has been reached
with GOM that it would establish and, thereafter maintain within its Agricul-
ture Department two new agricultural districts in the Project Area, each
headed by a qualified and experienced officer, such districts to be assigned,
at all times, with such powers, funds, staffing, resources and respon-
sibilities as shall be required to enable them adequately to undertake their



-33-
respective responsibilities regarding agricultural research and extension in
the Project Area; the first of such districts shall be established not later
than December 31, 1985 and the second, not later than September 30, 1988
(para 9.02 fol).
5.28    With the organization outlined above, VEWs would be working in vil-
lages where all or most of the farmland is, or will soon be, conmanded by the
project. All extension staff located in the newly-created districts would
work only in such district(s), under the control of the District Agricultural
Officer(s) (PAOs) created under the project.
The Public Works Department (PWD)
5.29    The Role of PWD in the Proiect. As in previous stages and in other
irrigation projects in Maharashtra, PWD would survey, plan, design, supervise
construction, and thereafter maintain the command area roads in close con-
sultation with the CE of ID and with CADA management of the project. The
Road Project Cell in PWD Headquarters would be retained throughout the
implementation period, with responsibility for overall control and liaison of
the road component. With the large scope of the works (657 km) two Command
Area Road Circles would be engaged exclusively in project-related works. In
addition, two specialist subdivisions, for quality control and maintenance of
construction equipment, would be attached to each circle. Back-up would be
provided by the PWD's Quality Control Organization and Mechanical Wing; the
Operation Wing would provide field testing equipment for quality control and
mobile maintenance units to undertake a regular program of inspection and
servicing of equipment employed on the widely scattered construction sites.
5.30    Road Maintenance.  GOM is conscious of the need to safeguard the
large investments now being made in the rural road programs by ensuring that
proper and regular road maintenance is undertaken. For many years, respon-
sibility for constructing and maintaining the roads has been divided between
FWD who looked after the national and state highways and the Zilla Parishads
(ZP) who took charge of all other roads. The ZP have their own public works
organization. They were partly fintnced from State funds, channelled through
various GO! departmental budgets (including P1D), and partly from local
revenue. The CE (PWD) retains ultimate responsibility for works carried out
by the ZP units and financed from state funds, but, in practice, it is often
difficult to control effectively the large number of semi-autonomous
entities. With the introduction of large rural roads programs in 1977/78,
PWD was appointed as a sole executing agency for the road construction works,
regardless of the road category. They are also responsible for the main-
tenance of selected lengths of important district roads. Thus, many of the
scheme roads would be retained by rwD for maintenance when construction is
completed; the remainder would be handed over to the local ZP units. In both
cases, the ultimate responsibility for adequate maintenance would rest with
PWD.

Monitorint and Evaluation
5.31    The monitoring and evaluation unit, nov under CADA Aurangabad, will be
strengthened and perform the following functions, if appropriate, in coordina-
tion with the relevant entities. The Monitoring Unit of the Construction Wing
of Aurangabad will participate in some of these assignments. An agreement has
been reached with GOM that (i) it will prepare a plan for monitoring and
evaluation activities, for construction activities, expenditures, irrigation
performance, groundwater, crops, water charges, and staff posting and training
by December 31, 1985; (ii) strengthen the existing Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit and provide it with adequate funds and staffing to carry out the monitor-
ing activities under the project; and (iii) commencing June 30, 1986, furnish
the Association within three months after the end of each reporting period
semi-annual reports, which would compare plan and actual implementation in
physical and financial terms; describe deviations from plans and explain the
reasons; provide a revised implementation schedule, with analyses and conclu-
sions of the monitoring and evaluation activities; and (iv) submit to the
Association a project completion report not later than six months after the
closing date of the credit (para 9.02 [p1). A special Mh&E cell would be estab-
lished within the M&E Unit of CADA to monitor the four SDDs and adjacent con-
trol distributaries. The methodology of conducting the above methods of data
collection will be determined in consultation with qualified experts.
5.32    Evaluation studies of project impact on production and income will be
conducted through universities or research institutes for which provisions vere
made in the cost estimates (Annex 1, Table 9).
VI. WATER MAAAGEMENT AND TRAINING
Present Situation
6.01    Most major projects in Maharashtra use the shejpali system of water
management which operates under the Bombay Irrigation Act. Under this system,
farmers apply for "sanctions" (permission to use irrigation water) seasonally
for annual crops and for up to 6 years for perennials. The sanction is a form
of contract under which ID agrees to supply irrigation water until the sanc-
tioned crop matures. Sanctions are granted by ID, after considering demand,
availability of water, soil conditions and the current policies of the Govern-
ment as to which crops should have priority for irrigation. According to the
sanctioned areas in each chak farmers are supplied in turn until their crops
are fully irrigated. Irrigation is from tail to head of the chak field chan-
nels. When all the sanctioned areas in the chak are irrigated, the supply is
either turned off or, if crops require more water, the cycle is started again
at the lower end. In the absence of gauging devices to measure the flows, each
plot is irrigated until the farmer is satisfied. In such system there is no
incentive to save water and therefore the time when the farmer receives or
turns off the water is unpredictable, making efficient water management at
field level difficult. Intervals between irrigations during maximum demand
tend to be too long. The main and distribution systems have to operate accord-
ing to demand. In times of peak demand, they run continuously; in times of
sparse demand, they have to be regulated.



-35-
6.02    GOM is aware of the deficiencies of the shejpali system and has
examined the possibilities of introducing alternative systems such as
warabandi.l/ Consequently, a system which combines the advantages of both
shejpali and warabandi has been devised. That system is called rigid shejpali.
It has been introduced into the area and is the form of Rotational Water Supply
(RWS) to be used in the project. In this modified system a gauged standard
irrigation stream provides water to each irrigator on fixed (preset) time
schedule and duration, according to the crops sanctioned. It has the advantage
of being predetermined and having built-in incentives to improve irrigation
efficiency: the amount of water allotted is based on the crop and its area and
assumes average irrigation efficiency. If no landshaping has been done, field
efficiency will be low and the farmer will not be able to irrigate the entire
area. Its great disadvantages are the larger number (than in warabandi) of
gate adjustments required and the greater risk that operators will discriminate
between farmers. However, if required, both rigid shejpali and warabandi are
flexible enough, and interchangeable at a later stage.
Rotational Water Supply Operation
6.03    The Outlet and Field Channels.  The fundamental principle of RWS is
to supply an efficient, convenient, easily usable irrigation stream at preset
intervals to each farmer. Experience and research have shown that satisfactory
delivery for open-channel gravitational projects with many smallholder users
lies roughly in the 18-40 1/sec range. It is influenced by soils, crops,
topography, farm size and farmer skills. Given flows of this order, which are
equivalent to supplying a depth of 155-345 mm/day over I ha, the irrigation
stream must necessarily be intermittent and rotated within the chaks. GOM has
standardized on a 1 cfs (28 uls) flow, which is about 10 mu/hr, for 1 ha. .Z/
The interval between irrigations depends on the crop's water requirement and
field capacity. In black cotton soils, a 14-day cycle has been found agronomi-
cally suitable for the majority of crops grown, and is convenient since the
farmer can be assured of his supply on the same day in each cycle. A fixed 1
cfs irrigation stream implies a maximum chak size of around 24 ha if the field
irrigation intensity is about 70Z. Therefore various durations of chak flow
will be necessary for differing chak sizes and irrigated crop intensities
within the chak.
6.04    Present Operation of the Jayakwadi System.  Presently, the outlets in
upper Jayakwadi have a more or less uniform discharge of 28 l/sec which serve
differing chak sizes, and only part of the commanded area is sanctioned for
irrigation. Thus, the flows at the main canal and the distributaries need
frequent adjustments at the pertinent control structures. To complicate the
situation, many farmers do not perceive the need for night irrigation, given
the present abundant water supply. To meet these abrupt fluctuations in
demand, the main canals were divided into reaches between cross regulators and
O  A slightly modified version of warabandi was tried in Girna with some
success in the late 1970s. One of the major obstacles to the introduction
of the North-West India version of warabandi is that the demand for water
fluctuates during much of the growing season because of the higher rain-
fall.
J Equal to 100 m31hr.



-36-
through observation, and trial and error, the reservoir releases are computed
and carried out. At present, the main canals are running at less than half
capacity, and therefore permit large fluctuations without posing any risk.
Regulation problems will become more difficult as the project approaches full
development, and the operating criteria will require further refinement.
6.05    She Maialxaon system.  As in Jayakwadi, the main and branch canals will
be designed to supply the peak irrigation demands by continuous flow. The
distributaries will normally be rotated 7 days on and 7 days off, providing an
irrigation supply to each farm once in 14 days during periods of peak demand.
If irrigation is requested more frequently (i.e., kharif and/or hot season), a
7-day canal rotation can be used, with the distributaries rotating 3-112 days
on and 3-1/2 off, all this without readjusting the gates. In case of long dry
kharif spells, the system will be geared to provide water promptly to the
farmers, following prescheduled programs. It has been agreed with ID that chak
sizes will be as close to 24 ha as possible, and only in exceptional cases less
than 15 ha. This will have two benefits: (a) the number of chak gates to be
operated will be reduced; and (b) the operation of a proportional flow system
- if found beneficial -- will still be possible in the future. While the
current policy of the GOM to use the standard 1 cfs irrigation stream
throughout the State is acceptable, two distributaries in the Hajalgaon project
should be operated with proportional flow, to evaluate the comparative merit of
the two systems. A computer model will be developed to determine the need for
on line storage and subsequently to control the daily operation of the system.
Sanctioning. Water Charges and Administrative Procedures
6.06    The following would be considered to ensure the smooth operation of
the system:
(a) the ID would be responsible for supplying the sanctioned amount of
water at the prescribed time;
(b) crops would be sanctioned in such a way that the volume of water
(which may be expressed as a duration of fixed flow) will, if water
is a constraint, be proportional to the farmers' CCA;
(c) CADA and its operation staff would prepare irrigation schedules
before the commencement of the season based on the crops sanctioned
for irrigation. The irrigation programs would be sent to the
officers in the field together with directives to improve efficiency;
(d) instead of crop-specific water charges in the kharif, a flat fee per
hectare of cultivable command area (adjusted for inflation) would
be levied whether farmers irrigate in the kharif or not. The supply
systems would be preset and water promptly provided during kharif,
when public facilities normally are underused because of the rain-
fall.
(e) for the rabi and hot season, water charges would be based on sanc-
tioned applications as at present. Crop sanctions for rabi and hot
season would be planned annually on the basis of water available in
Paithan and Hajalgaon reservoirs on October 15;



-37-
CE) the supervising officers would carry out surprise checks and enter
the results in a log maintained for the purpose;
(g) the results of monitoring Irrigation performance (para 5.30 [ci) will
be analyzed every quarter and every discrepancy clarified and
resolved; and
(h)  the operation staff should not be burdened with construction. respon-
sibilities and would devote all their attention to OwM.
To support Cd) above, an agreement has been reached with GOM that, within the
capacity of the irrigation system, it would make supplementary kbarif irriga-
tion available for kharif seasonal crops where, and whenever, half of the
farmers concerned request water for irrigation (para 9.02 [q]).
Groundwater
6.07    The groundwater in the project area is held in shallow aquifers
immediately above the basalt. Exploitation is by shallow dug wells (typi-
cally 6-10 m) using small centrifugal pumps. Most of the inflow is from the
weathered zone (murrum) just aso ve the basalt. The yield from these surface
veils is estimated at 10,000 a /year. Allowing for recharge from the irriga-
tion supply, it is estimated that the CCA can sustain about 30,000 wells.
Each well could irrigate about 1 ha, giving a total potential of about
30,000 ha, or 101 of the CCA. There are already about 1,000 wells in the
Majalgaon CCA and over 2,000 in Jayakwadi CCA; further development will be
left to the private sector because the limited extraction possible from
individual wells makes it difficult to utilize them as a public source and
there.are ample cheaper surface sources for irrigating most of the area.
However, with the project, the open irrigation system will increase the
recharge to the wells that will yield more water more reliably than before.
The Maharashtra water law has provisions for raising special charges for
wells thus augmented. The conjunctive use of well and canal water will
increase the area that can be irrigated "on demAnd", much above the 30,000 ha
that could be irrigated only from wells, with a substantially increased
income to CCA farmers who have also wells, thereby justifying the additional
charge.
Trainingt Requirements (Annex 1, Table 20)
6.08    Staff for about 57 new subdivisions will require training.  Subdivi-
sions (SD) at present are organized with either an agricultural or an
engineering background. A typical agricultural division would deal with
landshaping and drainage and would be headed by a Divisional Soil Conserva-
tion Officer (DSCO) with 5 subdivisions. Each SD has 5 Agricultural Super-
visors and each of these has 5 Agricultural Assistants. Agricultural super-
visors have a degree in agriculture and Agricultural Assistants0, a certifi-
cate. Engineering Divisions which design and construct chak systems are
headed by an Executive Engineer (nE) with 5 Subdlivisions under the Deputy EE.
Each SD has 5 Junior Engineers with 2 Technical Assistants. The staff of
these divisions and subdivisions require training, either in WALMI or by
experienced CADA personnel, the latter either on the job or in formal short
courses. Irrigation staff would be trained in water manag ement research and



-38-
overall system operation, including hydrological and transient flow models.
Farmers- training, especially in the Majalgaon area where there is at present
no irrigation experience, will also be intensifielI substantially under the
project, and will include basic knowledge of irrigation principles and
agronomy.
6.09    The level of training will be matched to the education level of the
trainees. Those with professional or sub-professional background will be
trained in WALMI, others will be given in-service training by CADA. Annex 1,
Table 19 shows the total training requirements and Annex 1, Table 20 shows
how this is to be split between WALMI and CADA. Agreement has been reached
with GOM regarding the implementation of this program (para 3.20). In addi-
tion, an agreement has been reached with GOM that it would, by December 31,
1985, prepare a detailed timetable and logistic plans for training of project
staff in CADA and WALMI (para 9.02[r]).
6.10    Water and Land ManaRement Institute (WALMI).  WALMI was established
in 1980 under a US$3.81 X provision in Credit 954-IN (MCIP II) to provide
in-service training, land and water management to CADA and ID personnel.
There are 36 faculty members and the current training capacity is 2 intensive
and 8 orientationlspecial courses per year.
(a) Intensive courses last 10-12 months and include hydraulics, irriga-
tion engineering, water management, soils, irrigated crops, statis-
tics and computer programming. Four months of field work is done as
part of the course.
(b) Orientation courses over 8 weeks deal with one of several subjects
such as water & land management, land development and includes a 2-3
week field exercise.
Cc) Special courses are conducted for special project needs. One was
run for XWUP, others have been organized for special groups of senior
officers.
The maximum training capacity is about 60 per year for the intensive course
and 240 per year for the orientation and special courses. Plans are being
made with USAID assistance to double this capacity from 1985 onwards. Some
physical (i.e., building, classes, facilities) and conceptual (i.e., lengths
of courses, curriculum) changes are under way to increase the training
capacity of WALMI, starting mid-1985.

VII. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. FARN INCOME AND COST RECOVERY
Agricultural Production
7.01    In parts of the project area where at present there is no irrigation
infrastructure (new Jayakwadi-68,000 ha, and Majalgaon--100,000 ha) cropping inten-
sities are 100% to 105% per year. The principal crops are foodgrains and legumes for
subsistence, and short-staple cotton. The upper reaches of the project area (about
132,000 ha) are now partly irrigated and grow food and cashcrops, like long-staple
cotton and groundnuts (Annex 1, Table 22). Vithout the project, rainfed farming is
not expected to change much but improvements are expected in the irrigated area,
where cropping intensities ranging from 137Z to 165Z are likely to be attained as a
result of previous projects (Annex 1, Table 23a).
7.02    With the project, intensification and shifts to production of higher-value
crops are expected to accelerate. Attainment of the higher cropping intensities is
expected to take 7 years in previously irrigated areas and 12 years where surface
irrigation is newly introduced. The projected yield levels would be attained in
about 20 years. The ultimate expected cropping pattern, and the way it fits into
the cropping and farm management calendar is shown in Chart 5. Ultimately, at full
development, the cropping intensity is expected to reach 175%, with enough water for
large scale hot season crops and/or carryover, and the cropping pattern would include
more groundnuts, sunflower, and long-staple cotton (Annex 1, Table 23b). The largest
output increments in physical terms are projected for sugarcane, bananas and sorghum.
In value terms, cotton, sorghum, groundnut, sunflower and bananas are expected to
account for 80X of the incremental value of production.
7.03    Until the project area is fully developed, there will be a large surplus
water (known as type C). This water is likely to be used to grow an even larger area
of hot-season (seasonal) crops than contemplated in the proposed cropping pattern
(Chart 5), including groundnuts and sunflowers, which do not require supporting
investment in new processing facilities. The use of this water to increase the
production of sugarcane beyond the existing processing capacity is undesirable since
its net return per unit of water is amongst the lowest in economic prices (Annex 1,
Table 24b). However, this additional temporary hot season production has not been
taken into consideration in the benefit streams of the project.
Market Prospects and Prices
7.04    In general, incremental production from the project will be a small percent-
age of Maharashtra's production, generated over a relatively long period, and there-
fore can be readily handled by existing marketing channels. Prices of groundnut,
sunflower and safflower are likely to be kept steady by India's strong income elas-
ticity of demand for edible oils, and by its continuing efforts to replace its large
palm-oil imports. Cotton prices will, in the long run, be dictated by international
market prices. With respect to varieties, it is expected that production will switch
from short-staple desi cotton towards medium-to-long-staple cotton which is more
readily marketable and provides a higher return per unit of water.
7.05    Maharashtra produces and eats a large share (43%) of India's sorghum.  A lot
of the buyers are rural landless families and the urban poor. Intra-year price
fluctuations are great. Therefore, it is expected that the project-generated incre-
ment might produce some real farm-gate price declines (to the benefit, incidentally,



-40-
of rural and urban poor). The financial farm-gate sorghum price has been set accord-
ingly.
7.06    Marketing of incremental output is expected to build up very slowly.  Output
will amount to 1.5 X tons in the year 2000 and 2.6 M in 2025, of which roughly
two-thirds will probably be marketed. Thus, the marketing system will have to accom-
modate roughly one million tons within 15 years and 1.7 M tons within 40 years, with
sugarcane comprising 40% of the incremental volume. Sugarcane is harvested and
transported to local factories by the growers cooperatives who own these mills. At
present, Government procurement of foodgrains and pulses does not operate in the
project area; prevailing prices are above support prices.
Farm Incomes
7.07    As can be seen from the following table, net annual farm income for
average-sized farms now varies from a low of Rs 4,300 per family (about $60 per
capita) for the lower unirrigated reaches of the project to a high of Rs 11,500 per
family (about $154 per capita) for the upper, partly irrigated reaches of the
project.  These figures include the value of marketed produce, home consumption, and
allow for the cost of purchased inputs, the use of family labor and bullocks, all
valued at prevailing prices.

7.08    Currently, farms at the lower reaches, without canal irrigation, use
about 145 days of labor per year plus another 88 days with animals, with
almost all labor furnished by the family itself. These farms use only about
two 50 kg bags of fertilizer per year and just over Rs 700 worth of seed.
The upper reaches' irrigated farms use 260 to 280 days of free-standing farm
labor and another 140 associated with bullock-tillage. They are hiring
casual labor at peak periods and some permanent labor all the time. They
also use over 8 bags of fertilizer a year, and about Rs 1,900-worth of seed
(Annex 1, Table 29).
7.09    Between 1985 and 2004, more and more reliable water would bring
better yields of higher-value crops like cotton and oilseeds, with intensive
use of purchased inputs: fertilizers, seeds, etc. These changes would
require substantial increase in labor. At full development - about 2030 -
the average farm would need about 475 mandays plus another 230 with bullocks.
Most of the farms would have to hire labor, providing fuller employment for
the project area's landless population for most of the year and requiring a
larger influx of migrant farm labor at peak periods. The import of bullock
labor from other districts, especially for cane transport, would expand.
7.10    If 80Z of the land of the average 4.5 ha farm had to be levelled at a
cost of Rs 3,000/ha, farmers would face an expense of Rs 10,800 for landshap-
ing during the first dry season, before starting to benefit from the project.
Conventional NABARD and SLA terms (10 year repayment with two years' grace)
would impose on farmers a significant decline in standard of living, espe-
cially in the third and fourth years of their participation, coinciding with
the termination of the grace period. Therefore, financing of landshaping,
whether backed by NABARD rediscounting (interest rate - 10.25%) or by SLA
(13.8%) or by some other financial entity, would not allow farmers to repay
without reducing their pre-project standard of living (para 5.20). While
upper-reach farmers could repay in ten years with a 4-year grace period,
lower-reach farms would need at least a 15-year repayment period and a 7-year
grace period (Annex 1, Table 32).
Cost Recovery
7.11    The most important vehicle of cost recovery is taxes on agricultural
output marketed (Annex 1, Tables 30 and 31): sugarcane, groundnuts, and
long-staple cotton. These taxes represent the largest source of cost
recovery from project farmers (excluding payments for landshaping). Since
farmers are price takers for sugarcane, cotton, and oilseeds, the incidence
of these taxes is predominantly, if not totally, on farmers (Annex 1, Table
31). Cesses for education, local government, and the Employment Guarantee
Scheme are another vehicle. They vary with season and crop and tend to
correlate with the value of production obtained from the irrigation area
(Annex 1, Table 30).
7.12    Water charges are the most direct instrument for cost recovery.  They
are fixed roughly in proportion to the amount of water a crop uses and to the
value of water in the season of use. Water charges are reviewed every five
years. After the 1975 review, when water charges essentially reached their
present level, Maharashtra had the highest rates of any Indian state, a



-42-
status matched recently by Gujarat which raised its water charges to a some-
what higher level. The 1980 review made minor adjustments, increasing the
charges for hot-season crops, to reflect the high cost of delivering water in
that season and its scarcity. For the cropping pattern assumed under the
project, present water and water-related charges would average about Rs 488
per ha of CCA. 11 The water charges will be reviewed in 1985. The intervals
between reviews are too long and should be shortened.
7.13    With Bank Group encouragement, GOM has undertaken studies of alterna-
tive water-charge systems in recent years. Under MCIP I, the feasibility of
volumetric charges was studied but its administration was found to be dif-
ficult and expensive. Under MCIP II, a variety of experimental charges
(including no charge) were to be tried to increase the use of irrigation
water in the kharif. Analysis of the problem of kharif irrigation in years
of inadequate or unevenly distributed kharif rains, shows that the most
economic use of stored water is to supplement erratic monsoon rains.
7.14    Actual maintenance, repair and minor improvement costs are around Rs
55/ha (1983 data) but the establishment costs have increased during the last
four years, from under Rs 50/ha to about Rs 75/ha, or by over 50%. The
present allocation for O&M for all Bank-financed projects in Maharashtra is
Rs BO/ha. The level of O&M allocation need to be reassessed to account for
changes in O&M component prices. A study of O&M costs is being conducted by
GOM to determine an appropriate allocation.
7.15    GOM water-charge collection has been improving and has reached about
8OZ state-wide for all types of projects; however, for major surface projects
in the "commissioning" period, collections are characteristically much
lower-25 to 40Z, but improve substantially after a maturation period of
several years. In estimating the cost and rent recovery levels under the
project, it has been assumed that: (a) the level of market taxes, and
water-related cesses will remain unchanged; (b) water charges will increase
in real terms at about the same rate as the projected increases in produc-
tivity; and (c) assessments are collected. Based on these assumptions, cost
and rent recovery indices are estimated at 702 and 24%, respectively
(Annex 1, Table 33).
7.16    Agreements have been reached with GOM ttat it would:  (a) maintain
on a continuous basis, its water charges at such levels as shall be required
to ensure that revenues from water charges shall cover the average costs of
operation and maintenance, and a reasonable portion of the investment costs,
taking into account the repayment capacity of farmers; (b) review every two
years and, if required, revise Maharashtra's levels of irrigation water
charges; (c) conclude its study of O&M costs, not later than December 31,
1986, submit this study to the Bank for comments and based on the study
recommendations and Association comments; and (d) determine the appropriate
annual amount for operation and maintenance costs for irrigation projects
(para 9.02 Es)).

taxes.

VIII. BEUEITS AIND JUSTIFICAT~ION
Project Iiui,act
8.01    In assessing project impact, it is importaut to be specific about
what vould happen vith the project that would not have happened without it.
Of the 300,000 ha project area, 132,000 ha (of which 90,000 ha with some OFD,,
*    ~and 42,000 ha alnost without it) already have irrigation facilities. ThLe
chanes in agricultural performance are expected to result from:
(a) the improvements in irrigation facilities, drainage, roads, landshap-
ing and management to agreed standards on the 132,000 ha already
coimmanded;
(b) the integration of 92,000 ha of new cultivable command area--68,000
ha in Jayakwadi and 24,000 ha in Majalgaon-to be completed to the
agreed standards during the disbursement period; and
Cc)  the integration of the final 76,000 ha of Majalgaou, to be completed
to the agreed standards after 1990.
8.02    Incremental production is presented in Table 26. By 2000, annual
incremental production is expected to reach Rs 1,700 M (US$145 M) or
Rs 1,400 M (US$16 M) net of incVremental on-farm costs. By 2025, these
figures will increase to Rs 3,200 II (US$268 N) gross and Rs 2,600 N
(US$220 -) net of on-farm costs.
8.03    The agricultural changes engendered by the project will expand the
demand for farm labor by an estimated 10 N labor-days aud 4 N bullock-pair
days in 2000 and by 17 M laborer days and 6.5 H bullock-pair days in 2025.
This amounts to about 58,000 full-time jobs by 2000 and 95,000 by 2025. A
lot of this labor would be provided by the now 66,000 land-owning families of
the project area during times whan they are not fully employed. More than
half of the additional employment would go to the 35,000 families of landless
people in the project or to migrant laborers from poor districts like Bhid.
8.04    Poverty impact. The absolute poverty income level for rural India is
estimated at Rs 1370 per capita and year. The landless population in the
pro(ect area is estimated to be 227,000, in 38,000 families, of which 83
percent are considered to earn their living as faxm workers. It may be
assumed that the per capita income of these families does not exceed the
poverty level. On the average, the incomes of the about 66,400 farm families
in the project area are above the poverty level. However, with farm income
being a function of fam size, farm families below the threshold size are
likely to have incomes below the poverty level unless irrigation facilities
are provided and production intensified.

/a Including value of family labor.
The threshold farm sizes in the table are for the different subareas, taking
into account the present farm size distribution. It is estimated that around
54 percent of the farm families live at or below the poverty line.
8.05    With the project, farm family incomes are expected to increase to an
average of Rs 10,608 per hectare, thus moving the poverty threshold farnsize
to 0.8 ha. Under ceteris paribus conditions, it might be assumed that by
full development about 10% of the farm families would be below the poverty
level.
8.06    As a result of project-induced agricultural intensification, farmers'
higher incomes and higher degree of integration into the market, the project
area would also see additional commercial and secondary economic activities.
Economic Analysis
8.07    The benefits streams are based on detailed farm models available in
the project files. The costs cover all the items included in detailed
project cost tables (Annex 1 Tables 4 to 9). Minor components relating to
the SDDs, monitoring units and training studies have been excluded from the
economic calculations because their benefits could not be adequately quan-
tified. In addition to the costs included in the detailed cost table, the
cost streams include: (a) the cost of completing the development of the last
76,000 ha of Majalgaon command area between km 30 to km 165 of MRBC, to be
completed by 1994 (Annex 1, Table 8), and (b) the recurrent costs of
incremental extension service and of incremental operation and maintenance of
the entire system. Transfer payments, such as water-charges and other taxes
and duties, were eliminated from the economic account. Engineering and
administration costs at 12Z of net investment, and physical contingencies at
15% are included in the investment costs. Benefits associated with sunk
costs and/or non-project investments and activities (MWUP, extension, etc.)



-45-
were included in "future without project" benefits which were subtracted from
estimated "future with project" benefits.
8.06    The comparison between prevailing (financial) and economic prices may
be seen in Annex 1, Table 28. The economic price of traded outputs (ground-
nuts, cotton, sugai, wheat and rice) and inputs (fertilizers) were derived
from Bank Group projections of world market prices and by estimates of tran-
sport, handling and processiLg costs reflecting projections as to whether
India is likely to be an exporter or importer of these goods. With respect
to grains, it was assumed that, in the medium run, India will be on the
average close to self-sufficiency, exporting in good agricultural years and
importing in bad years. On the theory that what happens to major grains
(rice and wheat) and to major oilseeds (groundnuts) determines the relative
prices of other grains and legumes (sorghun, millet, green and black gram,
chickpeas) and of other oilseeds (sunflower and safflower), the prevailing
prices of these commodities were adjusted by the sane factor as the major
grains and groundnuts. Other outputs (bananas, vegetables, other) were
adjusted by the standard conversion factor (0.8).
8.07    Other project cost adjustments were as follows:
(a) unskilled labor at two-thirds of the financial price to account for
the substantial un- and under-employment in India at that level;
(b)  equipment by the standard conversion factor (0.8), and civil works by
a variety of factors ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 and depending basically
on the amount of unskilled labor embodied in the activity (Annex 1,
Table 28); and
(c) farm inputs other than fertilizer and labor, by using the standard
conversion factor 0.8 (chemicals, hybrid cottonseed, etc.). The
exceptions to this rule are bullock labor, where the adjustment
factor of 0.96 translates a real scarcity, and certain kinds of seed,
where adjustment was less than the SCF for the same reason.
8.08    On that basis, the economic rate of return of each segment and of
the project as a whole is presented in the following table:



-46-
The-Economic Rates of Return for Different Sub-areas of the Proiect
(a)  Jayakwadi    - First Segment (NWUP, Pilot, Farmers)(53,350 ha)         46Z
(b)  Jayakwadi    - Second Segment (MCIP I and GGK Portion)(78,650 ha)    29Z
(c) Jayakwadi    - Third Segment (New Area)(68,000 ha)                      18X

(e)  Total Proiect (Annex 1. Table-35) /I                                   20%
In the event that investments were suspended after the current time-slice
was completed in 1990 and the final phase of Majalgaon was never completed,
the rate of return on investments in this project would not be substantially
different-22Z.
Sensitivity Analysis and- Risks
8.09    As a result of 20 years of experience in developing the Jayak-
wadi-Kajalgaon irrigation system (the last seven of these with Bank Group
involvement), a great deal is already known about the risks and uncertainties
of developing irrigated agriculture in the project area. Based on past
experience, there are four dangers: (a) that farmers will be slower than
expected in using irrigation facilities; (b) that completion of irrigation
facilities will take longer than anticipated; (c) that yields levels attained
will be lower than expected; and (d) that civil works will be more costly
than anticipated. To minimize the risks that farmer response might not be
adequate, or that yield levels might be lower than anticipated, the project
provides for landshaping and for system operation methods which will ensure
that all farmers, including tail-enders, will obtain reliable water supply.
In addition, the project focuses on increasing agricultural productivity,
especially through the SDDs', technical support to farmers, research and
development, and monitoring and evaluation. The combined effects of these
activities should result in a high return per unit of water and high level of
farmers' participation.
8.10    Tests were made to ascertain the sensitivity of the project's
economic rate of return to these risks. Regarding (a), if farmers took fully
20 to 30 years to adjust to irrigation instead of the 7 to 12 years
projected, the project's overall economic rate of return would fall to 12%.
Regarding (b), if it were to take five years longer to complete each project
segment, the overall ERR would fall to 13Z. If (c) full-development yields
were 15% less, the overall rate of return would only fall to 17%; and (d), if
anticipated investment costs increased by 20%, the overall ERR would only
11 The other segments of Majalgaon--not included in this time-slice--have
ERRs of 12Z. The ERR of the total project takes them into account. If
the almost completed Majalgaon dam and the ongoing works on the first
part of the main canal that were taken as a sunk cost are included, the
ERR will decrease to 17%.



-47-
fall to 18Z. The "switching values' that would cause the overall ERR to fall
below 12% are: (a) farmers' adjustment to irrigation taking 22 years in the
upper reaches and 32 in the lower; (b) delays in completion of 7 years;
(c) full-development yields 45Z lower than projected; or (d) an invest-
ment-cost overrun of 87Z. In short, on economic grounds alone and without
considering any employment or induced benefits, if the project is an economi-
cally viable investment even if afflicted by one of the major risks. The
probability that two or more of these events might occur in combination to
that extreme level is not significant.
Environmental Impact
8.11    Waterborne Diseases.  The project would take an environment which is
a difficult one for human habitation, as evidenced by the extreme poverty of
residents in the project area completely without irrigation, and make a
modest but dignified standard of living possible. Resources of water, soil
and solar energy that are presently wasted, either totally or in part, would
be converted into food and fiber. All this would be done without adverse
effect on human health. The two main health scourges often associated with
irrigation projects are under control in the project area. Nalaria incidents
were reduced during MCIP I, which included support for GOff Health Department
spraying in the project area. Control is a regular and on-going state-wide
activity of the Health Department, which declined the opportunity to request
additional assistance under the project. Schistosomiasis which is rare in
India, is confined to the small "Gimvi focus" in Ratnagiri District of
Maharashtra, far from the project area, and on the western slopes of the
Ghats: no water reaching the Ginvi area can possibly enter any of the eastern
rivers or their tributaries, which water this and other major-
surface-irrigation projects in the State. Besides, the Health Department is
vigilant for its possible spread. Therefore, no additional interventions
through the project are appropriate. However, an agreement has been reached

NARARUSETRA COMPOSITE IRRIGATION I*1 PROJECT
Specially Developed Distributaries
Introduction
1.      In the Jayakwadi Command, irrigation water use is low and farmers
face difficulties in getting water. To remedy this situation a 4,000 ha
Pilot Project was taken up under MCIP 1I to find ways of improving the water
delivery system to each field. The Pilot Project has served its purpose; in
its area water can reliably reach the fields. Based largely on findings in
the Pilot Project area, the Irrigation Department has brought out an OVD
manual, album of drawings and other design documents.
2.      The cost of Pilot Project was, however, high and another project,
named Farmers' Project, with more restrictive cost norms, was taken up in
1980. This project was also successful. Since the water could now reach
each farm, irrigation utilization increased from around 25% to 80Z in Pilot
Project and to 65% in Farmers- Project. In these projects, the emphasis was
on system improvement: little attention was paid to agricultural production
in the command.
3.      Proposed Solution.  As the next stage in solving the problem of lou
water utiization, it is proposed to designate four distributaries, two under
PLBC, one under PRBC and one under MRBC, as Specially Developed Dis-
tributaries (SDDs). Four nearby distributaries will be used as controls for
comparison of agricultural production and yields.
4.      The SDDs and the control distributaries will be brought to the same
standard of engineering improvement as contemplated in the MCIP I and MCIP
III (vide Appendix 1). For works below the outlet, the standard proposed is
that laid down for the AMUP.  These are the basic prerequisites for comparing
the performance of control distributaries and the SDDs. In addition to the
above, the following special efforts would be made in the SDD distributaries
but not in the control distributaries to increase irrigation water use and
total agricultural production from the area.
(a) Irrigation Extension Services:
Farmers' Training which will cover irrigation techniques: bow and
when to irrigate, and how much to irrigate.
(b) Azricultural Extension Services
The normal T&V extension advice on cultural practices, but with
more CADA participation than at present

Irrization Extension Services
6.      Changing from dry land to irrigated farming requires changes in
cultural practices. There is a general feeling amongst cultivators that more
water gives higher yields. The cultivators need to be trained in irrigation
techniques such as borders, ridge-and-furrow, and basins. Also, they have to
be educated how, when, and how much to irrigate. The work can be done by the
agricultural extension organization.
Agricultural Develoument and Extension
7.      To pay for the irrigation infrastructure and its upkeep, the ultimate
cropping intensity must be around 175%. With the available water for irriga-
tion, and maximum utilization of monsoon rains, this would be approximately
as follows:
Kharif:      94% 11     Rabi:       62Z
Hot season:  13%        Perennial   6%
This high intensity, especially in the kharif, can only be achieved with
improved cultural practices, and with readily available supplementary kharif
irrigation, should there be insufficient rain or too great an interval
between effective rainstorms. Further, the right sequences and faming
systems that fit agronomic norms and do not create intolerable labour peaks
must be developed. These objectives can only be achieved if properly
qualified, experienced experts work on the problems and disseminate their
findings through a motivated, properly organized extension service.
8.      The responsibility for agricultural extension, now operating under
the Bank-supported Maharashtra Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 1135-IN)
has been removed from CADA and is now managed by the Joint Director of
Agriculture in Aurangabad and the PAOs of the six districts which span the
area. There is a strong case for re-establishing much closer links with CADA
through separate agricultural extension units (districts) for the command
area. Such an organization, which would be able to concentrate
single-mindedly on the problems of irrigated agriculture, would be in an
excellent position to popularize, and demonstrate on a large scale, the
findings of the specialist team envisaged in para 7 above.
9.      There would also be a case for having suitable equipment available,
on a demonstration scale, to lend to farmers in the SDDs. These should be
mainly animal-drawn but some tractor-mounted specialized equipment would also
be justified.
Farmers' Involvement
10.    Farmers' Organization have been formed at outlet and minor level in
all CADA-operated scheme areas. Few of these are actively participating in
the maintenance of field channels and field drains. Yet, the purpose of
11 Including long-staple cotton, some of which would be planted in the hot
season and some would finish in the rabi.



-103-
Annex 2
Page 4
farmers- organization is to maintain field channels and field drains, resolve
water disputes, and handle water distribution. These organizations are
developing, though it will take time for then to become fully effective.
Efforts made to activate them are:
(a) training of outlet comnittee Chairmen and members;
(b) assigning each outlet to a Canal Inspector and Junior Engineer;
(c) assigning Junior Engineers and Deputy Engineers to minor committees;
(d) organizing meetings of outlet and minor committees; and
(e) routing difficulties through outlet committees and minor committees.
It is proposed to have applications for water allocation for sugarcane and
other perennials processed through Minor Committees.
II.     Help of a sociologist to assist with the establishment of the commit-
tees is necessary.
Marketing and Credit
12.     The commercial infrastructure, consisting of both cooperative and
private shops, for distributing and selling agricultural inputs in the
project area is well established and its growth keeps pace with the expansion
of the irrigation system. Inputs are available in good time. Once estab-
lished, farmers are capable of financing purchase of the inputs they need.
However, at the time of converting from extensive, rainfed farming to more
intensive, irrigated farming, farmers can intensify more rapidly their use of
purchased inputs-principally fertilizers and seeds-if they could finance
that expansion with credit.
13.     Cultivators sometimes experience difficulty getting credit, mostly
because they have defaulted on earlier loans. Moreover, often the loan is
inadequate, because banks set loan amounts by the task and the amounts are
frequently not commensurate with actual costs (Appendix 2). Credit for
long-term investments, such as landshaping, is critical to the very operation
of the project and is to be addressed under the project for all participating
farmers. Except for those within the four SDDs, farmers would be expected to
finance their own incremental costs for additional farm inputs from their own
earnings or by recourse to existing short-term credit facilities.
14.    As one facet of the SDD program to accelerate the attainment of full
development, farmers in the SDDs would be assisted by CADA specialists to:
(a) help acquaint farmers with sources of borrowing where appropriate;
(b) assist them to coutact banks and complete documentation requirements;
and
(c) would vouch for cultivator-borrowers.



-104-                       Annex 2
Page 5
This intervention would significantly improve access to short-term credit to
finance production inputs. Standard nredit terms would apply for SDD cul-
tivators. However, as a financial protection to CADA, and in return for its
vouching for SDD borrowers, debts would be guaranteed by cultivators'
irrigated land and any arrears that were not promptly } aid to cooperatives or
commercial banks would be collected along with land revenue.
15.     Output marketing in the project area is adequately handled by the
existing system of regulated markets and by private and cooperaLive buyers,
which is expanding in concert with the expansion of irrigation facilities.
The seasonal nature of farming lead to seasonal fluctuations in farm-gate
prices because it is the buyers who bear the cost of storage and the risks of
price fluctuation. On the whole, the seasonal fluctuation in farm-gate
prices is consistent with these risks and might be considered high only in
the case of sorghum, where the market is exceptionally thin relative to
production and groundnuts, where merchants discount the product when insuffi-
ciently dried.
16.     To further the SDD's objective of rapid attainment of full develop-
ment, CADA would encourage cooperative societies to construct and operate a
small number of additional godowns in the four SDDs using their own resour-
ces. It is expected that these facilities and their appropriate operation
would lessen seasonal fluctuations. This would improve incentives to farmers
and speed the transition to more intensive, irrigated agriculture.
Adaptive Research
17.     To bridge the gap between possible and actual production levels on
farm, adaptive research on a large area is essential to resolve difficulties
and to get expert advice on difficulties not previously encountered.
Monitoring and Evaluation
18.     The impact of intensive efforts made and changes in crop pattern,
sequences and yield levels must be continuously collected and monitored.
Evaluation of the results, and the technologies used, needs to be done. Data
on crop yields will be collected by canal inspectors and by agricultural
extension staff by crop cutting experiments. Analysis of the data will be
done by the CADA.
Organizational Pattern
19.     To implement the SDD program, one subdivision per 1000 ha, with 4
Junior Engineers and 4 Canal Inspectors for irrigation and implementing
engineering works, will be required. The agricultural extension staff needs
to be augmented bv one graduated agriculturist, in addition to the normal VEW
cadre.
Financial Implications
20.     The financial implications of this SDD program are briefly summarized
below for a 5-year time slice:

As a prerequisite, the conveyance system will have been improved/
executed to MCIP I standards. These standards are:
(a) Full lining down to one cusec for distributaries/mianors/sub-minors;
(b)  Field channels and field drains with requisite structures, as per the
latest standards and as indicated in the OFD Manual;
(c) Protective lining to the field channels at selected locations;
(d) IOOZ land levelling to presently specified standards;
(e) Provision of farm roads and crossings to ensure approach to any farm;
(f) Providing link drains and improving main drains for effective
drainage.
Works are being executed to these standards already, except for farm
roads. Land levelling is still voluntary and requires owners' consent.
These four items will be attended to in the first two years.

Note on Providing of Crop Finance to Cultivators in the Command Area
of Special Development Distributaries
Preamble:
1.      The existing procedure for approving crop loans and disbursement to
the cultivator is to prepare a credit statement by the cooperative societies
and get it sanctioned by the District Central Cooperative Banks. The scale
of finance is decided by the Technical Group according to certain guidelines.
The Technical Group.  It is they who decide the cropwise scale of finance.
In most cases, the scale of finance is inadequate as it is based on the
creditworthiness of the borrower and not on cost of the operation.
2.      The Bank does not permit disbursement of one loan unless the previous
loan is repaid. In view of this policy, it is difficult for farmers to get
loans for double cropping.
3.      Kharif and rabi loans are recoverable by 31st March and 31st May
respectively, every year. At the expiry of these dates, the loan becomes
overdue and is liable for recovery by coercive methods as per provisions of
section 101 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act of 1960. Simul-
taneously, the borrower is declared defaulter and is nut eligible for fresh
finance till he repays the overdues.
Present Status of Farmers Credit Rating in Respect of Short-Term Loans:

sement of crop loan for the last 4 years are as follows:

6.      It would be possible to optimize the production in the comnud area
by introducing the following:
(a) to have CADA Cooperative Officers help acquaint farmers with borrow-

the lead commercial banks for the area;
(b) to have CDA. Agricultural and Irzigation Extension officers and
Cooperative Officers assist farmers in contacting banks and in com-
pleting requisite documentation;
(c) to have CADA, on approval of its Deputy Registrar of Cooperative
Societies, vouch for SDD cultivators who apply for credit; and
(d) to have CADA Cooperative Officers under the CADA Deputy Registrar of
Cooperatives, jointly with the Chairman and Experts Committee of the
District Central Cooperative Bank and CADA Extension Officers, review
credit norms per crop and per other loan purpose, as well as
prescribed repayment periods, with a view to making these norms more
consistent with farmers actual costs and financing needs.
7.      As a starting point for the review described in para 6 (d) above, it
is recommended that the following norms for short-term, crop loans be used as
a basis for discussion.

MAHARASHTRA CONPOSITE iRRIGATION III PROJECT
Landshapin2
Introduction
1.      The need for even irrigation water distribution within the field is
self-evident, not only to achieve an acceptable degree of water utilization,
but also to minimize water losses out of the crop root zone, and thereby
avoid water table buildup and consequent drainage problems. Even water
distribution can be assisted by a number of land preparation techniques;
however, all these presuppose a field that is neither undulating nor too
steep. Therefore, given the rolling topography of the project area, a degree
of land forming is essential on all but a small portion of the project area.
2.      Before irrigation was introduced, the cultural practices adopted
enabled reasonably efficient rainfed farming without landshaping. Tradition
and experience determined which field was most suited for early or late
kharif planting and there was enough land available not to till difficult
patches. The only need was for bunding to control erosion. However,
experience with the MCIP I project has shown that once irrigation was intro-
duced, landshaping could no longer be postponed: without it, irrigation
benefits, even when water could reliably reach farnmers' fields as in the
Pilot and Farmers' Projects, were severely restricted in unshaped fields.
Also, it was found that once irrigation water was available, farmers were
reluctant to leave their lands unplanted, ready for landshaping and forego a
crop, even if that crop yielded far less than had it been grown on properly
shaped land. This reluctance to withdraw land from cultivation, even tem-
porarily, effectively restricts landshaping to the hot season. If, however,
it could be started before irrigation is available, about half the area would
be free between about November and May.
3.      A considerable amount of landshaping has been done already during
the last several years, and the rate of work can be increased if enough
financing can be provided and farmers convinced to participate in the
program. The standard adopted, 0.6Z longitudinal and 0.2% cross slope, is
satisfactory; however, it is necessary to relate border length and width to
soil type and stream size.
Implementing Landshaping
4.      Organization.  Within each outlet command all land must eventually be
shaped in a manner that enables irrigation and drainage of each field without
interfering, or damaging, adjoining fields. Therefore, as soon as possible,
a master plan for each outlet would be prepared, which would mark cut and
fill in each field as well as the location of field channels and field
drains. Given existing farm boundaries, this may not be a straightforward
task but it is, nevertheless, essential to carry it out, and the sooner the



Annex 3
Page 2
better. Moreover, farmers should be persuaded that if necessary, their field
boundaries must be changed--something to which insufficient attention has
been paid in the past and negative attitude may develop in the future. As an
eventual objective, farmers should adjsst farm boundaries, by mutual consent
with their neighbors, to achieve a really efficient irrigation-and what may
well, in the long run, be more important -- drainage (and passage) layout.
Adjustment of farm boundaries could also significantly reduce tillage costs,
by increasing the output and efficiency of animal and tractor-drawn equipment
by making fields longer. However, as an immediate objective, no effort
should be made to change farm boundaries, except in the SDDs, unless
absolutely essential to implement a workable field irrigation and drainage
plan.
5.      To support these efforts, CADA would have to organize the necessary
surveys and mapping. They must also be equipped to do the cut and fill
calculations for any farmer whose fields would be shaped in the near future:
these calculations must be preceeded by a visit which would determine permis-
sible cut and fill in relation to the depth of soil in the particular field.
As a rough guide, at least 15 and preferably 20 cm of soil must remain on the
underlying murrun layer if severe early yield reductions are to be avoided.
Implementation
6.      Actual implementation would be in three different ways:  (a) by
farmers on their own, using their own resources and initiative; (b) by
farmers, using their own resources but seeking technical advice on field
layout, cut and fill; and (c) organized by the Maharashtra Land Development
Corporation (MLDC), an organization set up for the purpose and implemented
by CADA. More than 80% of the landshaping will be taken up in this manner.
7.     MLDCs operation.  MDC may use one or more of the following methods:
(a) Manual labor, under the Employment Guarantee Scheme, (EGS) as at
present;
(b) Mechanical equipment - usually small (80-100 HP) bulldozers, also as
at present;
(c) Engage farmers with their oxen or farm tractors and contract the job
to them, under CADA supervision.
Under (c), and indeed to assist farmers who wish to do the work, it would be
necessary for CADA to have available metal scraperboards and rear-mounted
blades for use by the farmers' oxen or tractors. If the work is on contract
to MDC, these attachments would be available free; if the farmers work on
their own farm, there would be a nominal charge for their hire.
8.      Under the project, financing needs would increase considerably,
because the expected much higher annual rate of landshaping (about 30,000 ha
per annum, against the currently achieved highest rate of 15,000 ha and more
usual 7-10,000 ha). It is expected that the greater involvement of farmers
and the additional 50 bulldozers with which ID's fleet for the project area



D o-; ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ lz
Annex 3
Page 3
would be augmented, would enable this rate to be increased. Additional
financial support for the necessary loans is expected to be of the order of
about Rs 360 x partly financed by the project. GOM would arrange for this
sum to be available through WlDC to the needy farmers. Recoveries of loans
given to the farmers to shape their lands are to be collected by the Revenue
Department, as arrears of land revenue.
Justif:cation
9.      Landshaping is justified on the following grounds:
(a)  In an undulating topography such as in Jayakwadi/Majalgaon, field
efficiency can be increased from below 60% up to 75Z (25Z increase in
water saving).
(b) The uniform and more gentle soil slopes prevent erosion and dis-
tribute equally the water to the plants; uniform plant growth may
increase yields under the Deccan soils conditions by 15-30%.
Cc) Uniform moderate soil slopes combined with appropriate drainage take
care of excess water during the heavy kbarif rains, reducing substan-
tially long-tern waterlogging of the plants, with all its negative
consequences. This may increase yields by up to 20Z.
Thus a total yield increase of some 75%-90Z can be expected with proper
landshaping.
10.     The investment in landshaping is relatively small--around 1OZ of the
total investment in irrigation in typical large scale projects in
Maharashtra. Combined with appropriate drainage it may reach around 15Z-20%
of the investment (Rs 4,0001ha). However, the incremental benefits stemming
from higher yields compounded with the added amount of water in the system
(saved by the higher efficiency) more than compensate for the extra costs.
11.     Landshaping, however, is not a simple process and should be
approached with care. Soil survey, detailed topographic survey, careful
determination of permissible cut and fill, and meticulous supervision should
accompany any large scale program of landshaping, like the one proposed under
the project.
12.    Additional technical aspects of landshaping are dealth with in Annex
4.

MA'RRASTRACOMPOSITE TIRTGAIION III PROJECT
Technical Supuort for Azrictltural Develqouet
1.      This Annex describes the probleims in earlier projects in Mahnrashtra
where irrigation was introduced into an established, successful rainfed
faxming system under which cultural practices problens of the black cotton
soils bave been resolved. multidisciplinary task force vould bring relevant
experience from other similar areas where the problems have been resolved.
Its function would be to adapt, test and popularize these practices,* increase
cropping intensities to us-e the available irrigation water and extend the
growing of high-value crops. The task force would work, during project
implementation, mostly in the SDDs but would eventually become senior
advisers to the entire Jayakwadilliajalgaon cozmmand.
The Problem
2.     The traditional farming system iu Nabarashtra on soils similar to
those of the project area is to plant the crops towards the end of the kharif
season, when the profile below about 6-8 cm is wet but the top dry enough to
permit access. The seeds planted are normally sustained by light
end-of-season showers that allow them to develop their roots to tap the wet
profile, thereby ensuring a satisfactory crop. Under irrigation, however,
such a croppinkg system is not practicable for the following reasons:
(i  this late khariflearly rabi crop implies an early kharif fallow, and
cannot be followed by hot-season crop;
(ii) crop selection for climatic reasons is limited to sorghum and saf-
flower;
(iii)  increments achieved by supplementary irrigation are not high enough
to warrant investment in a irrigation system.
3.      The success and full benefits9 of the project is contingent on achiev-
ing a high percentage of double cropping,* good yields and an increased area
of crops that give a high per ha return. Double cropping can only be prac-
tised after a kbarif crop: the second crop must be harvested not later than
May, otherwise early monsoon rains would spoil it. This means planting not
later than early February, something that can only be done after a kharif
crop. Therefore, the prime agronomic objective of the project must be to:
Ci maximize kharif cropping, thereby enabling as mach double cropping as the



-1.14-
Annex 4
Page 2
available irrigation water and the farmer's skill and enterprise permits, and
(ii) introduce remunerative crops in all seasons. This, as past experience
suggest, is unlikely to occur on a extensive scale, and at a sufficiently
rapid rate, unless cultural practices are modified_
4.      The area of the kharif crops possible to plant is constrained by the
length of time available for final seedbed preparation and planting before
the increasingly frequent and heavy rainstorms make it impossible to enter
the field. Moreover, the choice of kharif crops is limited to those that can
thrive under the conditions created by the heavy rains, given present cul-
tural practices. The coarse grains (sorghum, pearl millet) and, to a lesser
extent short-stapled cotton, are such crops; summer pulses are more sensi-
tive; medium and long-stapled cotton, groundnuts and sunflowers, only yield
really well in years when the rainstorms are light, but still frequent enough
to sustain the crop; - the kharif of 1984, notwithstanding the low total
rainfall, was one such season.
5.      In practice, given the currently practised way of preparing fields,
similar problems occur under irrigation in the rabi and hot seasons. This
is due to the orientation and slope of the field, which often leads to
accumulation of irrigation water at the lover end.  A further problem is the
erosion within irrigation units caused by the water stream entering them,
which relates to the slope within the unit. These factors militate against
Maximiing yields and also limit the choice of crops. To sum up, present
cultural practices and field layout
(a) limit kharif cropping intensities, yields and crop range;
(b)  limit ir-igated yields and, albeit to a lesser extent than above,
crop selection.
Discussion
6.      Kharif croppin. High kharif cropping intensities on black cotton
soils are achieved in other countries, e.g. the Sudan, by the use of
high-speed mechanized equipment. Wide polydisks, fitted with seed boxes,
operating at relatively shallow depth, pulled by 60-80 HP tractors, covering
2-2.5 ha/br, work round the clock to plant crops that can best tolerate the
increasingly adverse conditions as the rains intensify. The area that can be
so planted depends on the speed of the tractors, the organization and repair
services to back them up and the annually varying pattern of rainfall.
7.      This system has the following disadvantages vwich make its adoption,
even in a modified form, unlikely and possibly even undesirable in the
project area:



-115
Annex 4
Page 3
(a) It demands large farms and long fields. The former is not the case
and the latter impossible, given the need of permanent field channels
and field bands, and the fact that irrigated double cropping requires
these permanent features.
(b) Crop selection is still limited to sorghum, pearl millet and similar
crops that cannot give a high per hectare return;
Field IrriRation Practices
8.      In Mabarashtra, a great deal of thought and enterprise, on the
farmners' part, has gone into developing effective field irrigation systems.
(a) Zi&-zaM furrows: used universally for sugarcane, bananas and
other high-value crops. This is an efficient system but
sustainable only with high-value crops, because, except for
basic land preparation, it precludes the use of draft animals,
thereby making after-cultivations very expensive.
(b)  Level basiLns  if made on sloping land (i.e. most of the
project area) are either small and therefore inefficient for
animal traction or imply much earthuoving. This is expensive
and, on the shallower soils, enases yield reductions in the
-cut." areas that take a long time to recover.
(c)  Border strips which at present are advocated by CADA. Undoub-
tedly this will be the right solution when design details of
the length and width of the borders are exactly related to the
size of the water stream and the clay content of the soils.
The slopes recommended by CAD: 0.6% longitudinal and 0.2X
cross slope have been shown as correct.
Proposed Action
9.      Kharif croE=g1 .  In broad principle, the solution to the problems
of khArif cropping are well known: ICRISAT and other research organizations
have worked on it. The principle is to Irepare the land, preferably before
the rains, in a manner tha.t ensures the drainage of the root zone and thereby
enable access for planting and weeding, but also to avoid overdraining.
Under these conditions groundnuts, medium and long-staple cotton and sun-
flowers can be grown, and coarse grain yields considerably #creased. The
problem is the very high cost of the appropriate implement;V  its high power
requirement (4 and possibly even 6 oxen) also a problem, although less

serious, given the established tradition in the Deccan of sharing draft
animals.
10.     Irrigation Layout. Here the task is to codify and refine the
required slopes, border vidth and length according to soil types and the
water stream. While simple to define, this is likely to be a lengthy task,
involving much mechanical analysis of soils and many field trials.
The Proposed Task Force
11.     The problems associated with the raising of cropping intensities, and
the popularizing of remunerative crops will have to be resolved by an
integrated tean, working closely together. It would consist of the follcwing
disciplines:
(a) Atronomic Support. An agriculturist well versed with the problems of
crop husbandry under conditions of, or similar to, the Deccan
Plateau. With the assistance of a agricultural economist he would
identify unconventional, remunerative crops that can be successfully
grown and develop farming systems including these crops.
hb) Agricultural Enaineerinf.  Implements will have to be devised,
prototypes fabricated and tested, and work on land preparation and
border length and width pursued. It is not unlikely tuat this would
involve two separate individuals.
(c) ftricultural cum FarmnaM Systems Economist for the determination of
the costs and benefits of the new implements, cultural and irrigation
practices that would be developed by the agronomist and the agricul-
tural engineer(s) and for the farming systems work (b); this may well
involve a certain amount of market and marketing research.
(d) Irrigation Specialist well experienced with management and operation
of irrigation systems between distributaries and farmers' fields,
to recommend and implement layout and operation and to develop
farmer-controlled, operated and managed water allocation and field
system maintenance norms and organizations and water distribution
schedules for each season. He may well need assistance from a
sociologist to develop the methodology that would ensure a rapid
change of farmer attitude from rainfed to irrigated farming.
Job descriptions and a proposed organizational setup are given in Appendix 1.
11.     The Venue would be the Specially Developed Distributaries; the backup
work would be carried out in Parbhani University, whose agricultural
engineering workshop would do the necessary prototype fabrication. The CADA
Administrator and such of his staff as he thinks appropriate would have to be
closely involved with the work programme, its implementation by the team and
dissemination of the results.

MAHARASHTRA COMPOSITE TRRTGATION III PROJECT
Technical Support for AUricultural Development
Job Description and Work Organization
Introduction
1.      The principal function of the technical support team is to resolve
difficulties of introducing high cropping intensities and securing acceptable
yields in the project. To do so they have to review cropping systems cur-
rently practised under irrigation, and to identify the components of one that
makes better use of an environment improved by an irrigation system that
delivers water predictably and reliably to the farmers- field.. Such a famr-
ing system can only be developed by close and continuous iteration between
the team me the agriculturist has to resolve agronomic problems of crops
identified by the economist as readily marketable and sufficiently remunera-
tive; the agricultural engineer must develop fieLd layouts and cultural
practices for each crop that would enable farmers to attain the desired
yield; the agriculturist and economist must integrate the crops into a pat-
tern that is sustainable with the amount and timing of irrigation water
available to the farmer yet does not create intolerable labor peaks; the
irrigation expert must develop a system of operation, management, maintenance
and water allocation within the chak that enables the farmers actually to
implement, and benefit fully from the work of the other disciplines.
Functions
2.      In the light of the foregoing, the principal function of the team
would be for each member, in close coordination with his colleagues, to
contribute to developing all aspects of a farming system that optimizes the
farmers' use of his land and water resources; optimizes return on public
investments in the system, and ensures its safe and continuous operation and
maintenance below the chak.
Duties of the Team Members
3.      Each team member will, in addition to contributing to the overall
function of the team, perform other duties within his own discipline. Thus,
in aggregate, the individual members' duties would include, but not be con-
fined to, the following:
4.      Agricultural Engineer
(a) working with the agriculturist and the economist, review present land
preparation practices for the commonly grown crops under irrigated
conditions and quantify them in technical, economic and agronomic
terms;

(b) assisted and advised by the agriculturist, identify the shortcomings
of present cultural practices;
(c) devise animal-drawn implements that would prepare the land in a
suitable way for the crops to be grown, which would cost substan-
tially the same as the ones they would replace;
(d) working with irrigation engineers, refine landshaping criteria and
recommended border length and width according to the mechanical
analysis of the soil and the water stream entering the field.
5.     ftriculturist
(a) working with the agricultural engineer, review present land prepara-
tion practices for the commonly grown crops under irrigation;
(b) assist the agricultural engineer to identify the shortcomings of
present practices;
fc) evaluate the quality of land preparation done by the implements
designed or modified by the agricultural engineer and assess their
likely influence on yields;
Cd) based on the findings of the agricultural economist as to which new,
or not commonly grown, crop is likely to be beneficial to farmers,
and in consultation with crop botanists at Parbhani, identify likely
crops for inclusion in the cropping pattern, and develop and test
suitable package of practices for them;
(e) working with the economist, develop a number of alternative farming
systems, tailored to farmer skills, investment capacity and agronomic
potential of typical farms; the systems will have to fit to the
expected irrigation regime.
(f) identify the best farmers who are willing to try new ideas and share
their experiences and use them as vehicles for promoting new ideas,
new crops not tried yet, implements and innotivative packages of
agricultural practices.
6.      Farmizm  Svstems-cum-Agricultural Economist:

oualifications:
8. ftricultural Engineer:
(a) A degree in agricultural engineering and adequate experience with
implement design and improvement, with a strong bias for work on
soils similar to those in Maharashtra. He should be familiar with
workshop and metal fabrication practices, and be able to prepare
engineering drawings from which prototypes can be made. He must have
a background of metallurgy, to specify the metals to be used in
different parts of the implements.
(b) Sufficient field irrigation experience to relate border width, length
and stream size to mechanical soil analysis data, and test and
develop a formula for border specifications for different soil types.
Note:  It may well be necessary to engage two individuals, as one person may
not be adequately qualified in both branches of agricultural engineer-
ing.
9.     Africulturi&st. A degree in agriculture with adequate practical
experience in crop husbandry and farm planning. le must be familiar with all
the major crops grown on the Deccan and have had extensive experience on
black cotton soils.
10.     Parming Svstogs-cegwn-ricultural Economist.  A degree in agricultural
econonmics and adequate relevant working experience of fanm and project plan-
ning and budgeting, farm and farm management surveys and market research.

11.     Irrigation ExRert.  Suitable qualifications for irrigation engineer-
ing, relevant experience of managing secondary and tertiary systems (dis-
tributaries, minors and sub-minors) and proven experience in water schedul-
ing, and in organizing farmers to operate water distribution systems.
The Operating Plan
12.     The project's need would be met by a full-time agricultural engineer
and agriculturist; the economist and the irrigation expert would be required
for six months in the year. If it is necessary to engage two agricultural
engineers, the one dealing with field irrigation would not be fully occupied;
he could be usefully assigned part-time duties within CADA which would
increase his "feel" for project problems. The leader of the team should
preferably be the agricultural engineer but, if more suitable, it could be
the agriculturist. The leader's additional duties (as team leader) would be
to ensure complete interaction and coordination of work with relevant
authorities in Parbhani University. The team would be probably headquartered
in Aurangabad, to ensure close coordination with the CADA Administrator and
his Deputy Director of Agriculture. However, they would spend not less than
half their time in the field, working principally, -- initially entirely, -
in the SDDs. They would be supported by one full-time graduate agriculturist
assigned to each SDD.
13.     It seems possible that scientists with the appropriate background and
training cannot be found in Maharashtra for all the required disciplines. If
that be so, the ones not fully qualified or with insufficient relevant
experience would have to be supported by consultants; the consultants would
have the same functions, duties and qualifications as the scientists they
support. About two man-months consultancy per annum wouia be required to
support the economist and irrigation expert; the consultant agricultural
engineer and agriculturist, if required, would pay three visits a year to the
project, each lasting for one month; the agricultural engineer somewhat
longer than a month, while the agriculturist may not need more. The total
maXimum expected man-months for consultant's support would be about 50 for
the duration of the project.
14.     The necessary budgetary provisions within the project assume that the
supporting consultants will be expatriates; if not, costs would be lower.

MAHARASHTRA COMPOSITE IRRIGATION PROJECT III
RESETTLEMENT OF PROJECT AFFECTED PERSONS
This Annex consists of two parts. Part I, prepared by the Government
of Naharashtra (GOM), outlines their policies vis-a-vis persons whose
livelihood and lifestyle will be affected by an irrigation project under
which land will be submerged. It also contains a detailed description of
actions taken and contemplated in case of the Majalgaon reservoir site. Part
II describes the findings of Bank missions, analyses responses by GOM to
specific questions raised, and outlines steps to be taken to continue observ-
ing and monitoring the economic progress of the project-affected persons, to
enable remedial measures to be taken as soon as the need becomes manifest.
PART I - Submission by the Government of Maharashtra
A. The Resettlement Process - General
1.      Compensation and Rehabilitation.  In Irrigation Projects, where
culturable land and villages get submerged it becomes necessary to acquire
lands and villages on a large scale aed to arrange rehabilitation of the
villagers, the Project Affected Persons (PAP). The procedure consists of
following three operations:
Ca) Land Compensation.
(b) Compensation for Structures.
5c) Rehabilitation of the Project Affected Persons.
2.      Payment of Land Compensation.  The survey of India prepares a nap
from aerial photographs of the submergence area with contours at 2.5 m inter-
vals. With village maps superimposed thereon, approximate area under submer-
gence is worked out. To get details of the exact area that will be submerged
(for initiating land acquisition proposals), the full reservoir level contour
line is established by double levelling. For lands required for quarries,
dam site, housing colonies, etc., demarcation is done by the Irrigation
Department (ID). Proposals for acquisition of land are prepared by the ID
and reviewed by the Special Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO). After carrying
out joint measurements by the District Inspector of Land Records and repre-
sentative of ID to finalize the land titles, the Land Acquisition Officer
finalize the documents as per provision of the land Acquisitioi Act of 1976
(para 17). Payment of land is then made out of project funds.



-122-
Annex 5
Page 2
3.      In case the land is required to be acquired urgently while crops are
standing in the fields, crop compensation is also given. If the payment of
land compensation is delayed, rental charges are paid from the date of pos-
session of land to actual date of payment. Compensation for fruit trees is
made separately.
4.      Payment of Compensation Towards Structures.  Individual structures
are grouped into representative categories according to standard of construc-
tion. Type estimates for each category of structure are prepared at the
schedule of rates prevailing at the time of initiating the proposals, to
determine the rates per unit of plinth area for each category. Whenever a
particular structure does not fall under any category, a special estimate is
framed. Proposals of compensation for structures is a function of the plinth
area of each structure and its category. Depreciation since construction
date is taken into account. After joint measurements with the District
Inspector of Land Records and the ID, the proposals are reviewed by the SLAO
who, after making payment of compensation arranges to acquire the structures.
5.      Rehabilitation.  To streamline and coordinate the interrelated
activities, Government has established in 1965 an independent directorate for
handling rehabilitation. The main objective of this Directorate is to
provide "land for land" and "house for house" for a PAP. This Directorate is
headed by the Director (Departmental Secretary's level) who is assisted at
district level by a Deputy Director for Land and one for Development. The
District Collector is the Deputy Director of Resettlement for Lands and the
Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Parishad (District Council) is the
Deputy Director of Resettlement for Development. The Collector is assisted
by SLAOs and Rehabilitation Officers.  The Chief Executive Officer is
assisted by engineering staff for providing civic amenities to the resettled
villages.
6.      The Scheme of Resettlement initiated in 1965 has undergone con-
siderable changes in the past few years. Initially a person was said to be
'project affected' if his land and house was acquired for an irrigation
project. By now, however, the following are also treated as PAPs.
(a) Persons having less than one hectare of residual cultivable land.
(b) Persons whose residual land is divided into fragments which are
thereby rendered difficult for cultivation.
(c) Persons whose residual land is rendered uncultivable.
7.      The procedure involved in the work of rehabilitation is as follows:
(a) Collection of data about affected persons from all villages.
(b) Selection of sites for new villages.
(c) Acquisition of such sites, including approval of layout and
demarcation of plots.



-123-                        Annex 5
Page 3
(d) Distribution of plots.
(e) Provision of civic amenities in the new village, i.e. open vells,
boreholes, school, public meeting grounds, internal roads, approach
roads.
(f) Distribution of loans in cash or in kind.
(g) Procurement of building materials for construction of houses in
the resettled villages.
(h) Distribution of alternative lands for cultivators.
Ci) Shifting of the affected persons, including their personal
belongings and salvageable building material.
Items (a) to td) and (f) to (h) are attended to by the Collector in his
capacity as Deputy Director of Resettlement (Lands). All items under (e)
are attended to by the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Parishad in his
capacity as Deputy Director of Resettlement (Development). Funds required
for rehabilitation come from project x:unds.
8.      Collection of Data for Affected Persons.  Statistical data of all
the affected persons from each village are collected, tabulated and class-
ified in the following categories, to determine the scope of further
rehabilitation activities.
Ca) Persons who lose all their land and houses and who need resettlement.
Cb) Persons who lose a major part of their land and their houses and
who need resettlement.
Cc) Persons losing all their land, but houses are not affected and
who need resettlement.
(d) Persons losing part of their land, but houses are not affected
and who need resettlement.
(e) Persons having no land and houses but who live in villages as
farm laborers and need resettlement.
(f) Persons who do not stay in the affected village, but whose lands
are being cultivated with the help of farm labor or on contract
basis.
(g) Persons who lose land and houses but who do not need any
assistance from Government and who intend to settle at places
of their choice.



-124-                        Annex 5
Page 4
(h)  Persons who lose lands and houses and who intend to settle in
other villages where they procure private lands for cultivation
and who need help and assistance from Government for their
rehabilitation.
9.      Once data are collected and tabulated it becomes possible to form a
clear picture of (a) number of persons who are to be resettled in a new
village and (b) number of persons who are to be resettled by way of extension
of existing villages.
Selection of Site for a New Village
10.     The Village Site.  It is desirab'e that the new village sites are
selected in consultation with villagers. However, alternative sites should
be selected in advance, keeping in view (a) availability of drinking water,
(b) facility to construct an approach road, (c) good foundations for building
construction, (d) hygienic condition, (e) distance from the remainiag lands
for cultivation.
11.     Jnce a site is selected, acquisition proceedings are started by the
Deputy Director of Resettlement (Lands). Plan of the land under acquisition
is supplied to the Town Planning Department and a suitable layout is
prepared. The layout is marked on the site and plots are allocated. Cost of
land for the new site is a charge on the project. Separate areas are
reserved for threshing ground, cremation or burial grounds, schools with
playgrounds, public meeting places, parks, religious places, bus stand,
market place and pasture for cattle.
12.     Civic Amenities.  After the Deputy Director of Resettlement (Lands)
completes the work of acquisition of new village site and plots are demar-
cated, the Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Director of Resettlement (Develop-
ment) arranges for drinking water wells and bores, sites for schools, public
meeting grounds, internal roads, approach roads; for electricity and
indi%idual or regional piped water supply schemes if water supply from open
well or bore wells is inadequate. These works must be completed well before
the old village sites and lands are flooded.
13.     Distribution of Replacement Farm Lands.  Previously agricultural land
was granted to the PAPs from unallocated Government lands, forests and land
alienated under the Land Ceiling Act. Since 1973 the PAPs are given lands
which become surplus due to land ceiling act in the zone benefited by the
project and other suitable Government land, in accordance with the scale laid
down by GOM. The Rehabilitation Officer is required to ascertain requirement
and availability of suitable agricultural land in the command area and has to
acquire it for distribution to the affected persons. Costs are recovered in
suitable installments.
14.     Loans for Housink.  The affected persons get loans for construction
of their new houses. Generally, a housing loan amounts to Rs 5,000 to
affected persons if they are farmers and Rs 2,000 if landless. These sums



-125-                       Annex 5
Page 5
are according to the "Housing and Loan Scheme" of the Directorate of Reset-
tlement.
15.     Movina Affected Persons.  The Rehabilitation Officer arranges and
prrvides transport to enable the affected persons to move their belongings.
16.     Concession to Project Affected Persons.  The Government has granted
the following concessions to the PAPs. They may:
(1)  take useful construction materials from their acquired houses
in the old villages sites without any reduction in the amount
of compensation;
(2)  remove, free of cost, quarry materials like stones, murrum, etc.
from Government waste lands;
(3)  cultivate their acquired lands till those are actually submerged;
(4)  they are allowed free of cost transport for removal of their
personal kits;
(5)  they are supplied cement, roofing sheets required for construc-
tion of their houses at controlled prices, subject to avail-
ability, through project authorities;
(6)  preference is given to PAPs and their dependents for employment
in Government service. The upper age limit is relaxed by three
years in the cases of PAPs whose houses are submerged or who lose
75% of their land under Project. In case of Class III and Class IV
posts (n.b. non-clerical) one person per family of th-i PAP is given
priority of employment without reference to an employment exchange;
and
(7)  according to the recommendat:.ons of the committee appninted by GOM
in connection with the Maharashtra Resettlement of Pr.,ject Affected
Persons Act, 1976, additional resettlement subsidies, on a sliding
scale, are also sanctioned for certain categories of .dndholders.
17.     Rehabilitation Advisory Committee.  The Maharashtra Resettlement of
Project Displaced Persons Act, 1976 which came into force on March 11, 1977,
Rehabilitation Advisory Committees have been appointed to several projects in
the State. To deal with PAPs whose property falls in more than one district,
the Chairman of the Committee is the Conmissioner of the Division; the Col-
lector, Chief Engineer, Project Engineer (SE level), concerned NP, MIA, and
Chairmen of Panchayat Samitis (Parish Council) are the members. For PAPs
whose property is in one district, the Chairman of the Committee is the
District Collector, the Project Engineer (SE level) concerned MP, MLAs, and
Chairman of Panchayat Samitis are the members. The District Resettlement
Officer is the member secretary. Meetings are held once in three months.

B. Rehabilitation Procedures for the Najalzaon Reservoir Site
i8.    Selectinz new villate sites.  Chincraan. Deokheda and Dhorgaon
villages are near to dam site; Nandnr, Renapuri. Brab.agaon, Shelapuri,
Punandgaon and Mhunapur are Within 5 km of the dam. Since more than 75Z land
from these villages, except Dhorgaon, will be submerged by the reservoir and
most of the cultivators had small landholdings, they desired to resettle near
Hajalgaon town (a taluka headquarters) which has market, medical and educa-
tion facilities. Dhorgaon has been moved to a safe place near the old vil-
lage. The population of eight more villages of about 3,500 people vanted to
settle near each other, within 2 km of Najalgaon town, probably because of
the expected future development of the town and its surrounding area, better
prospects for developing a business, and better employment opportunities due
to irrigation development. The sugar factory near Manur (4 km), the Agricul-
ture College and its operational pilot sch-ee, housing societies, extension
of market facilities and processing industries in the industrial area
proposed by the HabArashtra Industrial Development Corporation were added
inducements.
19.    Nangrool, *adiwadgaon and Iaul villages are large and have their
lAnds along major streams that join the Sindhpana and the Godavari rivers;
their inhabitants have decided to settle in groups at other convenient
places. For some, their remaining land was the attraction; for others,
acquisition of future settlement.

Nimgaon, Deogaou chose to resettle on higher ground above the submergence
level. The villagers of Phulepimpalgaon moved to Jadid Jawala. Pungni and
Kaudgaon, which vill not be flooded for a while yet, have not yet decided
where to move.

20.    Distribution of building plots for all the thirteen villages under
the first phase and three villages under the second phase of resettlement bas
been cmnpleted. Allotment of plots for the remaining four villages was in
progress in 1984.
21.    Provision of Civic Amenities in the New Villates. The layout of the
new villages is prepared by the Town Planning Department, shoving internal
roads, approach roads, school buildings, market sites, dispensaries and
parks. Public buildings are constructed by the Zilla Parishad of Beed dis-
trict.
22.    Any village with a population of more than one thousand receives
piped water.  Villages with less than thousand people are provided with open
wells or boreholes. Each village has school buildings, meeting ground and a
market place. All village sites are connected to district roads with
approach roads wherever necessary, and have an internal road network. The
new Zilla Parishad, in consultation with the District of Collector, replaces
submerged religious structures.
23.    All new village sites will have electricity; 13 were connected in
1984, work was progressing on the rest.
24.    Free transport is provided by the Irrigation Department for con-
veyance of dismantled materials, household articles and fmily members for
shifting to new villages. So far there is no specific demand from the dis-
placed persons for allotting lands in the command area. This may be because
land is readily available in the vicinity of the settlement sites selected by
the villagers.
PART II - Overview and Recommendations
25.     Overview. The PAPs will suffer two kinds of material loss for which
they must be compensated: loss of home, and loss of land. While, clearly,
most will suffer both losses, the distinction needs, nevertheless, to be
made.
(a) PAPs losing their homes are located in 20 villages and number about
18,500, including women and children, and not 10,500, as reported in
paras 18-24 (1981 cenaus
data).  However, their physical relocation is correctly described.
(b) PAPs losing land on the river floodplain. Their numbers have not
been reported, only the area, which is divided as follows:
the 20 villages flooded         6,877 ha
government land                   200 ha
from 14 villages not flooded      609 ha
7,686 ha



-128-                    Annex 5
Page 8
Of this area about 1,900 ha will be exposed, due to reservoir drawdown,
between December and June and can, therefore, be cropped in the hot season.
Compensation has been paid to the extent of Rs 39.8 x by March 1985; this
sun paid for 3,371 ha. GON stated (April 1985) that they propose to pay the
balance in the 1985-86 financial year.
26.    Bank missions visiting the resettled villages and the area where the
PAPs now live had the impression that there appeared to be Lo undue resent-
ment at having to evacuate homes and abandoning farmland. Dwellings, and
house sites, are superior in the new villages; the provision of standpipes is
recognized to ensure a readily available, safe water supply in place of
shallow wells dug in the riverbed which was their previous source of water;
churches, temples and mosques are either completed or undr construction;
schooling facilities are better and more convenient than in the old scattered
villages; and employment opportunities, directly or indirectly attributable
to ECIP III project works, have increased considerably. Further, a very
definite cottage industry base is being established, largely because the
merging of several villages has created a more compact, accessible market for
the products.
27.    GOa have repeatedly stated that the "land for land" policy (Part I,
Para 5) is, overwhelmingly, not acceptable to the PAPs. The reasons given
were that they lost easily workable, fertile, well-vatered land on the river
floodplains which can not be replaced with land of similar quality. Rather
than accept land of very different quality and characteristics, be it of the
same total market value as the one lost because of the larger area offered,
they requested cash payment. Many moved to differert areas where they had
family and other connections. Uplands owned by the villagers, similar in
nature to parcels offered in exchange of the floodplains, were either
retained or voluntarily sold. Results of a survey submitted by GOX indicate
that eventually, 95Z purchased land of their choice, nearby or in other
locations; 2Z abandoned farming and went into trade or business; 3Z comple-
mented moneys received for their dwellings and built better houses. Appendix
I shows answers to supplementary questions posed, furth2r to amplify Part I,
B.
28.     Recommendation.  Under the project, CADA's existing Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit would be strengthened. This unit, supported by outside
expertise, either from the socio-econonic faculty of Parbhani University or
by other, independent sociologist consultants, would be in a strong position
to monitor the economic and social progress of PAPs who settled in the new
villages and of those vho did not have to resettle but lost farmland. Fol-
low-up on PAPs who moved into other areas would be more difficult, but per-
haps also less important: they are likely to be the more enterprising group
and therefore potentially the more successful one. Monitoring would be
carried out through extensive surveys, conducted by the Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit to ascertain how the moneys paid in compensation for land
have in fact spent and how the socio-economic position of PAPs who opted for
cash compensation is developing.
