NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Seventh Power Project of the National Electricity Board of the
States of Malaya (NEB) consists of the final extension of the Prai Thermal
Power Station (3 x 120 MW), transmission and distribution sub-projects and
consulting services. Prai Power station stages 1 and 2 of 2 x 30 MW and 1
x 30 MW were completed in 1967 and 1971 respectively, financed under Loans
350-MA and 579-MA. The final extension will use the site to capacity. A
132 kV transmission line would be built from Majadee, a switching station
near Johore Bahru, to Kota Tinggi, both to upgrade the present 6.6 kV supply
and ultimately to supply the Johore Tenggara rural area as it develops. Two
11 kV projects would supply power to two rural areas, the first located near
Alor Star in the North and the second between Segamat and Kluang in the
South. A study would be carried out by consultants to formulate a long-term
plan for rural electrification of West Malaysia.
ii.       NEB has received an aggregate of US$180.9 million (net of cancel-
lation) in six Bank loans since 1958 which have helped in financing 1,010 MW
of additions to system capacity and the expansion of the transmission system
which will interconnect all of Peninsular Malaysia. The proposed loan would
assist NEB in financing its expansion program and help raise the total system
capacity to 1,959 MW compared to 124 MW at the beginning of 1963; the Bank
would be involved for the first time in Rural Electrification in partnership
with the Federal Government, the State Governments and NEB. The projects
under previous loans have all been satisfactorily completed or are now under
construction and no significant problems have arisen since the beginning of
the Bank's association with NEB.
iii.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$171.3 million
equivalent of which the Bank would finance US$35 million, a portion of the
foreign cost. The balance of the foreign cost of US$84.9 million would be
financed from bilateral and suppliers credits and the local cost of US$51.4
million is to be financed from NEB's internal cash generation.
iv.       Malaysia has embarked on a dynamic program to expand the economy
both in agriculture and industry. For 1974, GNP grew by 17.6% at current
prices and 6.3% at real. Per capita GNP in 1973 was US$477. Demand for power
grew in line with the expansion of the economy.
v.        Responsibility for the power sector in Peninsular Malaysia rests
with three organizations: NEB responsible for most of the generation and
distribution; the Perak River Hydroelectric Company Limited responsible for
generation and transmission in part of the State of Perak which NEB will



- ii -
take over in 1976; and the City Council of Georgetown, Penang, responsible
for the island of Penang which NEB is to take over later this year.
vi.       NEB operates in Peninsular Malaysia and is organized as a modern
public utility with considerable autonomy. Separate Boards are responsible
for electric power in the States of Sabah and Sarawak. NEB's stock is almost
wholly Government-owned and the directors are appointed by the Minister of
Power, Technology and Research. The financial history is good and NEB's
present financial position is sound. A rate of return greater than 8% on
acceptably valued net fixed assets in operation is expected throughout the
forecast period.
vii.      NEB's expansion program required to meet forecast growth of FY1975
through 1981 is estimated at US$1,338 million; the proposed project would
account for 13% of this amount. The program has been selected after com-
parison of a number of possible sequences of system development of generation
and transmission.
viii.          The Prai extension is the only possible development that can be
constructed in time to meet forecast load and energy requirements in 1980.
It forms part of all the sequences of system expansion used to find the least
cost solution.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$35 million for a
period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

NATIONAL ELECTRTCITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The report covers the appraisal of the Seventh Power Project of
the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB), for extension
of generation facilities, rural electrification and consulting services.
1.02      The project consists of construction of an extension to the Prai
Power Station of 3 x 120 MW units, 132 kV transmission lines from Majadee to
Kota Tinggi and extension of the bulk distribution system to two rural areas.
The consulting services to be provided would cover a study of rural electri-
fication in Peninsular Malaysia and an updating of the Western Malaysia
system study.
1.03      The estimated cost of the Seventh Power Project is M$393.9 million
(US$171.3 million). The Bank has been asked to finance part of the foreign
exchange component in an amount of M$80.5 million (US$35.0 million) equiva-
lent, about 20% of the total cost. The balance of the foreign cost, M$195.3
million (US$84.9 million), would be financed from bilateral or suppliers
credits and the local cost component of M$118.2 million (US$51.4 million)
would be financed from NEB's internal cash generation.
1.04      The Borrower would be NEB to which the Bank has made six loans
aggregating US$180.9 million (net of cancellation). The first loan (210-MA)
of US$28.6 million was made in 1958 for the first stage of the Cameron
Highlands Hydroelectric Scheme. A second loan (350-MA) of US$51.1 million
was made in 1963 for the second stage of the Cameron Highlands Scheme, the
first stage of the Prai Thermal Station and the expansion of transmission
facilities. In 1966, a third loan (458-MA) of US$27.7 million was made for
the first stage of the Port Dickson Thermal Station, the installation of
additional generating units at the Cameron Highlands Scheme, the second stage
of the Johore Bahru Thermal Station and the expansion of transmission facil-
ities. The fourth loan (579-MA) of US$8.5 million was made in 1969 for the
second stage of the Port Dickson and Prai Thermal Stations and for the
expansion of transmission facilities. In 1970, a fifth loan (700-MA) of
US$20.0 million was made for the third stage of the Port Dickson Station
and transmission facilities. The sixth loan of US$45.0 million was made in
1974 for transmission, distribution, and control facilities associated with
the Temengor Hydroelectric Development (4 x 87 MW).
1.05      The projects under the first four loans have been completed and
are operating satisfactorily. Under the fifth, delays in the manufacture
and delivery of equipment have occurred and the commissioning dates of the
first two 120 MW units are estimated to be end 1975 and mid-1976 respectively,
about 20 months behind the original schedule. Construction of the projects
under the sixth loan is on schedule.



- 2 -
1.06      The project now proposed is required:  to provide the energy re-
quired by the expansion of NEB's system; to supply bulk power to rural areas;
and to study rural electrification.
II. THE ECONOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and its Economy
2.01      Malaysia consists of the peninsula of Malaya which lies between
Thailand and Singapore, and the States of Sarawak and Sabah on the island
of Borneo. The aggregate area of Malaysia is about 128,730 square miles.
In 1974 it had a population of about 12 million, growing at a rate of
2.7% per annum. Per capita GNP was US$490 in 1973.
2.02      The pace of economic growth in Malaysia began to accelerate in
the course of the second half of 1972. The year 1973 was an outstanding one
for the Malaysian economy. The upswing in the business cycle led to record
performances in almost all sectors of the economy and GNP increased 26.1%
at market prices.
2.03       1974 was also a good year.  GNP grew by 17.6% at market prices and
6.3% at real. Despite the worldwide recession and by Malaysian standards a
relatively high domestic inflation rate, the economy experienced a high level
of economic activity particularly in the first half of the year until some
of the major commodity prices began to decline. The rate of inflation
appeared to slow towards the end of the year and continued slowing in the
first half of 1975.
2.04       Rubber continues to be the main pillar of the Malaysian economy
contributing about 28.3% of export earnings and 17% of GDP. In spite of the
decline in rubber prices, exports managed a 15% growth in 1974. Timber re-
mains the second largest export earner, contributing 15% of merchandise
exports and 9% of GDP. The exports of saw-logs and sawn timber slumped by
14% and 23% respectively in 1974. Tin ranked third representing 14.9% of
merchandise exports and 8.9% of GDP. Palm oil ranked fourth representing
12.3% of merchandise exports and 7.3% of GDP. Petroleum products ranked
fifth, representing 6.5% of merchandise exports and 3.9% of GDP. The export
sector showed resilience largely because of the favorable palm oil, tin
and petroleum prices.
2.05      Imports shot up by about 50% largely due to high import prices.
The overall balance of payments, however, has about M$450 million surplus,
thus adding further to Malaysia's external reserves of about M$3,760 million
(US$1,600 million) at the end of 1974 which equals about 5 months of net
imports at present levels.
2.06      Industry is the principal power user, consuming 37.0% of total
energy sales in 1974. Commercial use ranked second at 29% while residential



-3-
users consumed 11.7%. The remaining 22.3% was used in bulk supply by other
public utilities and mining.
Energy Resources
2.07      Both natural gas and oil have recently been found off the east
coast of the peninsula of Malaya and earlier off the coasts of Sabah and
Sarawak. Production at present is about 100,000 barrels per day, or 4.5
million tons per year. In about 3 to 4 years' time, production is expected
to increase at least threefold. Since 1973, Malaysia has been a net exporter
of petroleum products. In the next few years, liquified natural gas might
also become an important foreign exchange earner.
2.08      Hydroelectric potential is still the most valuable indigenous
energy resource for power, with 295 MW installed and 348 MW under construc-
tion (Temengor Hydroelectric Development). A preinvestment study on the
Pergau Hydroelectric Scheme (100 MW) was completed by the Snowy Mountains
Hydroelectric Authority of Australia in 1969 under the Colombo Plan. A
group of Russian engineers is now making a feasibility study of the Sungai
Tembeling Scheme (90 MW). The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority is
making a combined flood control and power development feasibility study of
the Trengganu River (300 MW) on the east coast. The development of hydro
resources is therefore being actively pursued.
The Power Sector
2.09      Electric power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous
Government-owned entities. The largest of these is NEB which serves penin-
sular Malaysia with the exception of Penang Island which is supplied by
municipally-owned plants, and part of the State of Perak which is supplied by
the privately-owned Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE). The two
states on the island of Borneo are supplied by Government-owned statutory
authorities -- the Sabah Electricity Board and the Sarawak Electricity
Supply Corporation. The present capacity installed by all of these entities
is as follows:
Entity                              Installed Capacity (MW)
NEB                                           860.6
PRHE                                           142.5
Penang City Council                            43.3
Sabah Electricity Board                        88.6
Sarawak Electricity Corporation                59.2
Total                             1,194.2
In addition, there is a total of 21.4 MW in about 117 diesel plants owned
by small electric companies which supply power to customers on a licensed
basis and 158 MW of privately-owned small diesel units.



-4-
Facilities of NEB
2.10      NEB's total present generating capacity of 860.6 MW is made up
of 265.4 MW of hydroelectric plant, 540 MW of steam plant and 55.2 MW of
diesel plant. Details of the plants are given in Annex 1. Units 3 and 4
at Port Dickson Thermal Station (2 x 60 MW - Loan 579 MA) have been in
commercial operation since 1974 and Units Nos. 5, 6, and 7 (3 x 120 MW -
Loan 700 MA) are scheduled to go into service in 1976. The Temengor plant
(4x 87 MW) scheduled for completion by 1979 will bring NEB's total installed
capacity to 1,598.6 MW including hydro capacity of 613.4 MW.
2.11      Nearly all of NEB's generating capacity supplies the interconnected
system which covers most of the western side of peninsula of Malaya and
extends from Alor Star in the North to the Southern system around Johore
Bahru (see map). A 132 kV transmission line under construction from the
Western system to Kuantan on the east coast will be completed by the end
of 1975, and by mid-1976 this line would be extended to Pekan and Tg Gelang
and by 1977 to Jengka/Jerantut. The transmission lines from Temengor to
Machang, then to Kota Bahru and Kuala Trengganu on the east coast are
scheduled for completion by the end of 1980. Thus the entire peninsula will
be interconnected and the relatively high-cost isolated diesel stations will
be eliminated.
2.12      NEB's transmission system is operated at 275 kV between Port
Dickson and Kuala Lumpur South Substation, a distance of 45 miles.  NEB has
also 607 miles of 132 kV, 315 miles of 66 kV and 516 miles of 33 kV overhead
transmission lines as well as 11.5 miles of 66 kV and 52.2 miles of 33 kV
underground cables.  Distribution is carried out at 22 kV and 11 kV by some
2,823 miles of overhead lines and underground cables as well as 206 miles
of lines and cables at 6.6 kV, 3.3 kV, and 2.2 kV. 3,352 substations in
commission have a total capacity of 4,764 MVA.
2.13      NEB's system is connected to the PRHE and Penang City Council
systems which are commented on below.
The Perak River Hydroelectric Company (PREE)
2.14      The company and its distribution subsidiary (Kinta Electric
Distribution Co. Ltd.) generate and distribute electricity within their
concession area in the State of Perak to some 65,756 customers; the bulk of
tne output is sold to the mining industry. PRHE has a profitable operation.
The company is incorporated in the United Kingdom and operates under a
concession granted by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years with
a break-clause after 50 years. The Government has decided to exercise its
right under the concession agreement to acquire the assets of the company
in November 1976 for operation by NEB. Negotiations continue on the settle-
ment to be reached.
2.15      The price to be paid for the assets has not yet been agreed but
on the assumption that the amount will not be excessive, the takeover should
improve NEB's financial viability.



-5-
2.16      PRHE has 142.5 MW of generating plant, 27 MW of which is hydro-
electric and 115.5 MW is steam.  When the Port Dickson power station exten-
sion is commissioned 37 MW of the older thermal plant will be placed on
standby, reducing PRHE's operating plant capacity to 105.5 MW.
Penang City Council
2.17      Special provisions were made in the Electricity Act of 1949 for the
Penang City Council to continue operating its own electricity system to supply
the island of Penang. Given the concentrated, densely-populated area of
Penang and the recent industrial development of the island, the Council's
Electricity Department has been able to operate viably and generate suffi-
cient funds to subsidize some of the other departments of the City Adminis-
tration. For some time, Penang has purchased electricity in bulk from NEB
(42 million kWh in FY74).
2.18      Penang Electricity Department's financial viability was badly
affected by Government's refusal to allow fuel surcharges to be passed to
industrial and commercial consumers following the fuel crisis. Government
agreed that NEB would take over the department during calendar 1975 and
negotiations to this end have been held. The price to be paid for the assets
has not yet been agreed but on the assumption that it will not be excessive,
NEB's financial viability should be improved.
Rural Electrification
2.19      Rural electrification in Malaysia began in the 'fifties when a
large number of the rural population was concentrated in villages during
the emergency. These villages were electrified from diesel generators to
provide perimeter lighting for security reasons. Originally the installations
were operated by NEB's predecessor organization (the Central Electricity
Board) on cost reimbursement from Government. After the emergency, the
majority of the small systems were sold to private licencees as they were
uneconomic on a full NEB service basis; 89 such licencees still exist.
2.20      Rural electrification as a social objective began in 1957.  By the
end of FY74, 2,187 villages had been electrified covering 197,000 consumers.
About 25,000 rural consumers per year are now given supply which is more
than 50% of NEB's domestic consumer increase.
2.21      While it is Government's intention to electrify rural Malaysia
as much as reasonably possible, the current program is unplanned. Villages
make application to the State Governments for supply; state administrators
select villages from these applications arbitrarily for recommendation to
the Federal Government which agrees the program according to the avail-
ability of funds.
2.22      NEB defines rural electrification as financially non-viable domes-
tic electrification, treating viable loads as normal extensions. Records
are not available to show the economic and financial benefits/deficits from
the rural program to date. The program is financed one-third each by the



-6-
Federal and State Governments and by NEB -- including estimated operating
deficits for the first 7 years. Operating deficits greater than the estimates
and for the period after 7 years, are borne by NEB. Until now, the recur-
ring deficits have been insignificant in NEB's scale of operations. However,
the rural program is not having a great effect on the backlog of domestic
rural houses that need supply. About 814,000 rural houses were without
supply in 1970; approximately the same number exists now, as the annual
program keeps only slightly ahead of the increase in rural houses resulting
from the 2.7% population increase. Popular demand -- already apparent --
will therefore cause the program to accelerate and the resulting cash
deficits may no longer be insignificant for NEB.
2.23      Low-voltage (LV) distribution equipment and materials are now, or
by next year will be, manufactured locally, but manufacturers cannot com-
pete with foreign bidders within the Bank's 15% preference margin. As im-
ported LV distribution equipment and materials are subject to 30-40% customs
duty, electrification of villages, if financed by the Bank, would cost more
than if purchased locally. Accordingly, NEB is not presently interested in
Bank financing for such purposes. At any rate, it can be safely assumed
that NEB would have to support the local industries, whether it wanted to
or not (see paragraph 3.14).
2.24      Malaysia and NEB need a properly planned rural electrification
program. Government and NEB have agreed that consultants be appointed to
carry out a study and make a report on the outlines of a plan for total
rural electrification of Peninsular Malaysia.
III. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be NEB, established in 1949 under the Electri-
city Act of that year, a financially sound, well-organized and operated
utility.
3.02      NEB is organized and functions as a modern public utility corpor-
ation with a considerable degree of autonomy. It is both a regulatory and
operating agency, charged with the operation of the electric installations
under its jurisdiction and the establishment of such new facilities as may
be required. It regulates the production and use of electric energy in
West Malaysia and grants licences for the installation and operation of
independent electricity works to be used for public or private purposes.
NEB has the legal power to set its tariffs (see para. 3.07) but operates
under Government direction in this regard.
3.03      The Board of Directors consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairman
and not more than 10 nor less than 5 other members. At present there are
10 members, all of whom serve in a part-time capacity, with the exception
of the Deputy Chairman who is also the General Manager. Members are appointed



-7-
by the Minister of Power, Technology and Research, subject to terms and con-
ditions he may determine. The present Chairman is currently Chief Secretary
to the Government; the responsibilities of the position cover both being
Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service. Other members of
the Board are prominent in the political, labor and business communities.
Management and Staff
3.04      NEB reorganized its management structure during the past two years
based on consultants' recommendations which took into account Government's
policy of providing more equitable distribution of job opportunities among
the different races. Principal changes in higher-level positions are being
made as suitably qualified and experienced Malays become available. A recent
Wages and Salary Award which gave only a small increase to NEB employees
and removed some benefits has caused morale problems at all levels in NEB
and the lower level employee unions threatened strikes during May 1975. A
copy of the organization chart is shown in Annex 2.
3.05      The previous loan agreement contained an undertaking that the
Bank would be consulted before appointments were made to the positions of
General Manager and Financial Controller. It was agreed that this under-
taking be continued for the proposed loan.
Consultants
3.06      In the past, NEB used consultants to make engineering and manage-
ment studies and for design, procurement and supervision of construction.
The arrangement and performance have generally been satisfactory. Recently
NEB began to use its own staff to design and supervise the construction of
small thermal units (the sixth unit at Johore Bahru Thermal Power Station
of 30 MW) and 66 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and will likely expand
such activities with time. NEB will however continue to use consultants
to augment its own capabilities for large or complex facilities.
Tariffs
3.07      Under the Electricity Act, NEB has the power to fix tariffs without
reference to any other authority. In practice, because of political con-
siderations, the Cabinet now deliberates on the sector's tariffs. NEB's
stated policy in the past has been to produce a return on its average net
fixed assets in operation of at least 8% per annum and to finance at least
40% of construction costs from internal sources. In the past, NEB's internal
cash generation has financed over 60% of the expansion program, but this
situation will change due to accelerated load growth, the expanded construc-
tion program and inflation; consequently, greater reliance will have to be
placed on borrowing and additional equity.
3.08      Basic tariffs have not been revised since 1964 and are therefore
not related to NEB's current costs of system operation in view of the
changes that have occurred since then. NEB had Electrowatt of Zurich review



tariffs in 1972, but they did not then investigate the cost of supplying the
different categories of consumers. NEB has recently re-engaged Electrowatt
to study these costs and an outline of appropriate terms of reference for
the study has been sent to NEB covering inter alia the incremental costs to
the economy of NEB operating and expanding its system. A report will be
issued by mid-1976. It has been agreed that NEB shall exchange views with
the Bank prior to making any changes in its tariffs.
3.09      Following the fuel crisis, Government, as part of its anti-infla-
tion policy, did not permit NEB to apply the fuel adjustment provisions
contained in the tariff schedule to industrial and commercial consumers.
This policy continued until March 15, 1975 I/ when Government agreed to
fuel surcharges being applied to all consumers. Agreement was given partly
because NEB was running into cash problems and partly as a quid pro quo
for an arrangement with ESSO that the loss on the Port Dickson power station
fuel oil contract, based on pre-fuel crisis oil prices, would be shared
one-third by NEB and two-thirds by ESSO.
Taxation
3.10      NEB is liable to pay corporation and development taxes.  Corpora-
tion tax is levied at a rate of 40% of taxable income and development tax at
5% of gross income. In addition, NEB is liable to pay import duties, fuel
tax of M$17 per ton and a surtax of 4% on imports. Exemption was given from
these taxes up to March 15, 1975 when fuel surcharges were applied to all
consumers, but full liability to tax operates from that date.
Accounting and Audit
3.11      NEB has an efficient finance and accounting organization, but
experiences some difficulty in recruitment and retention of qualified staff
because of the market conditions for such staff created by the rapid expan-
sion of industry in Malaysia. Increasing use is being made of NEB's computer:
-    the billing system is being expanded to cover
more consumers; and
-    present worth and rates of return techniques will
shortly be used to evaluate internally planned projects.
3.12      Price Waterhouse and Company have been principal auditors of NEB
since it was established; a local firm of accountants, Hanafiah, Raslan,
Mahomed and Partners audits NEB's branches; both firms are acceptable.
During negotiations, assurances were received that NEB will continue to
employ independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
/ t About 3% of gross revenues has been lost in FY1975 after offsetting
customs and sales tax exemptions.



-9-
Insurance
3.13      An existing covenant requiring NEB to maintain reasonable insur-
ance coverage has been followed. This covenant is repeated in the agreement
for the proposed loan.
Industrial Participation
3.14      NEB is promoting the establishment of local manufacturing capa-
bility in electric meters, paper insulated lead-sheathed cable, medium
voltage distribution transformers and switchgear. A company has already
been formed in which NEB has a 51% interest to manufacture paper insulated
lead-sheathed cables; commercial production is expected to begin in late
1975. Proposals from several companies have been received for cooperation
in the manufacture of electric meters, medium voltage transformers and
switchgear; local companies are expected to be established next year. The
total estimated investment required is unlikely to exceed M$25 million and
to ensure investment for non-power purposes does not exceed this amount
without the agreement of the Bank the latest loan agreement includes a
covenant providing for the Bank's concurrence to any industrial participation
by NEB when these exceed M$25.0 million. Continuation of this covenant was
agreed for the proposed loan.
Training
3.15      NEB runs a comprehensive staff training program under its Education
and Training Department. Since 1960, 393 engineering scholarships have been
sponsored at overseas universities; of this number, 212 have graduated and
181 were continuing their studies at December 31, 1974; loss to NEB of
returned graduates amounted to 13, or 6%.
3.16      A training school is being planned and construction is expected to
begin during FY76. A staff member of the International Labor Organization
is currently attached to NEB to formulate the curricula. Courses offered
will generally be at technician and clerical level with the aim of augment-
ing NEB's manpower requirement and furthering Government's policy of en-
suring equitability in employment for Malays.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project proposed for Bank financing will consist of the
following:
(a) the final stage extension of the Prai Thermal
Power Station comprising three units of 120 MW
each, scheduled for commissioning iR August 1979,
February 1980 and August 1980, respectively;



- 10 -
(b) a 132 kV transmission line from Majadee switching
station to Kota Tinggi, a town in the rural devel-
opment area of Johore Tenggara, scheduled for
service in 1978;.
(c)  extension of 11 kV distribution system to two
rural areas, scheduled for service in 1978; and
(d) consulting services for a rural electrification
study and other services.
Prai Thermal Power Station Extension
4.02      The first stage of the Prai station (2 x 30 MW) was completed in
1967 under Loan 350-fA.  The second stage (1 x 30 MW) was completed in 1971
under Loan 579 MA. The site is adequate to accommodate 3 additional 120
MW units.  The units will be generally identical with only minor modifica-
tions in specifications to the three units now under construction at Port
Dickson Thermal Station (Loan 700-MA). Each unit will consist of one 839,520
lbs per hour reheat type boiler designed to operate under steam conditions
of 1,800 psi and 1,0000F/1,0000F and a turbo-alternator with a maximum
continuous rating of 120 MW.
Transmission and Distribution Sub-projects
4.03      One transmission and two distribution sub-projects for bulk supply
to rural areas are included in the loan package.
4.04      The 132 kV transmission line, 16.5 miles in length, is from Majadee
switching station to Kota Tinggi. The whole district of Kota Tinggi in-
cluding the Johore Tenggara regional development has a population of 61,500
according to the 1970 Census. It is now being supplied at 6.6 kV from Johore
River Waterworks 22/6.6 kV substation which is connected by 15 miles of
single circuit 150 mm2 22 kV overhead line from Tebran tie-in substation
in Johore Bahru. Maximum demand in 1974 at Johore River Waterworks was
3000 kW which is expected to increase to 5000 kW by 1976. The maximum
demand in 1974 at Kota Tinggi was 710 kW which is forecast to grow at an
average annual rate of about 13% over the next ten years. The 22 kV over-
head line is reaching the limit of its capacity. Frequent breakdowns have
been experienced on this very old line due to lightning and corrosion
cf earthwires. A 132 kV, 300 mm2 double circuit line is therefore proposed
by .EB to be initially operated at 66 kV with provision for future extension
lnto the Johore Tenggara rural development areas.
4.05      The two 11 kV distribution sub-projects are designed to supply
power to two rural areas, one located near Alor Star in the north and the
other located between Segamat and Kluang (see map) in the south. Requests
for bulk supply have been made by residents of the Segamat Selatan area
for many years. These can be met on completion of the 66 kV line (financed
under Loan 1031-MA) from Seganac to Kluang, the purpose of which is mainly to



- 11 -
strengthen the southern network by completing the 66 kV loop. The distri-
bution sub-projects involve mainly 11 kV cables, 11 kV/0.4 kV distribution
transformer, 11 kV switchgear, low voltage cables and overhead mains. Total
number of consumers to be served by these two sub-projects would be about
1,100 and 2,200 respectively in the early years.
Rural Electrification Study
4.06      In order to prepare for future projects, NEB agreed that a consul-
tant's study of rural electrification is required in West Malaysia to formu-
late a rural electrification plan and review its technical, economic and
financial implications. Among other things the consultants will study (see
Annex 3 for Terms of Reference):
-    achievements of NEB's past rural electrification program;
-    future load, energy and consumer growth in rural areas;
-    capital and operating costs;
-    economic benefits;
-    existing licensed installations; and
-    criteria to be used in selection of areas and villages
to be electrified.

4.08      The basic cost estimate is in mid-1975 prices.  Physical contin-
gencies of about 10% for civil works and 5% for plant and equipment were



- 13 -
included. Price contingencies of 12% for 1975, 10% for 1976, 8% for 1977-79
and a,' after 1980 were assumed to cover price escalation in foreign cost
components of civil works and equipment. The rate of price escalation for
local costs was assumed to be 7-1/2% per annum.
4.09      Excluding taxes and price contingencies, the unit cost is about
US$340 per installed Kw. This is of the right order of magnitude for mid-
1975 prices.
Financial Arrangements
4.10      The proposed Bank loan as requested by ilEB will finance the
foreign exchange costs of civil works and plant and equipment of the Prai
Thermal Power Station Extension with the exception of boilers and turbo-
alternators, as well as the foreign exchange costs of transmission and
distribution sub-projects and consulting services as illustrated below:

4.11      NEB plans to use bilateral and supplier credits for the procure-
ment of boilers and turbo-alternators. These are estimated to cost about
US$84.9 million. A bilateral credit of C$50 million equivalent to the Ma-
laysian Government from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
has so far been used only to finance C$12.5 million for engineering and
supervision services for the Temengor Hydroelectric Project and updating of
feasibility studies for Bersia and Kenering Hydroelectric Projects. The
Malaysian Government may use this credit for the procurement of boilers
provided that the offers of Canadian manufacturers under international
bidding are competitive with world market prices. Tender documents inviting
international bids were issued on June 6, 1975 and opened on September 6,
1975. Favorable credit offers were received. Evaluation and clarification
are now underway. Decision is expected to be made by the Government before
December 1975. No difficulty in financial arrangement is foreseen.
Engineering and Construction
4.12      A local firm, Malaysia International Consultants (MINCO), has been
engaged by NEB to provide engineering services on detailed investigation,
design and construction supervision for civil works of Prai Thermal Power
Station Extension Project. Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of London has
been retained by NEB to furnish a project manager and three senior engineers
on electrical and mechanical equipment in the Project Design Team in Kuala
Lumpur and also the back-up services in PCR's home office.
4.13      In view of the fact that this is the first major thermal project
to be undertaken by NEB and MINCO, assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that PCR will review the tender documents and designs prepared by
NEB and MINCO and that during construction PCR will appoint a Senior
Resident Engineer for the overall supervision of the Project.
4.14      Engineering and design for transmission and distribution sub-
projects will be done by NEB's own staff.
4.15      Civil works for the Prai Extension other than steel works and
chimney will be awarded to local contractors after competitive bidding.
Equipment will be installed by suppliers on a supply and erection basis.
The transmission and distribution sub-projects will be constructed by local
contractors under the supervision of NEB. A project implementation schedule
for Prai Extension is shown in Annex 5.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.16      The equipment and materials to be financed under the proposed loan
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines with the Bank's usual 15% preference
being granted to local manufacturers. Civil works to be financed by the
Bank (representing approximately 25% of the total cost of civil works) would
also be contracted through international competitive bidding.
4.17      No expenditures other than engineering are expected to be incurred
before the loan is signed.   Disbursements for the proposed Bank loan would



- 15 -
be made against: (i) 100% c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment and
materials, (ii) 100% of local expenditures ex-factory for equipment and
materials manufactured locally; (iii) 70% of total expenditures for imported
equipment and materials procured locally; (iv) 100% of foreign exchange
component of civil works; and (v) 100% of foreign exchange component of
consulting services. Any balance of surplus funds remaining after completion
of the project will be cancelled unless there are good reasons for applying
the savings to related works. An estimated schedule of loan disbursements
is shown in Annex 6.
Ecology
4.18      Prai power station is located about 5 miles south-southeast of the
town of Butterworth. It is situated in an industrial zone with a rather low
population density. The nearest residential area is about 1.3 miles away.
According to the measurements made by NEB from three air-pollution monitor-
ing stations since 1970, the sulphur oxide concentrations have been within
permissible limits. A chimney of adequate height will be constructed to
disperse undesirable pollutants.
4.19      Discharge of cooling water into the channel will cause no problems.
Oceanographic and hydrographic surveys ard temperature measurement are
underway. A cooling water recirculation study will be made using the
mathematical model of the Danish Hydraulic Research Laboratory.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Power Market
5.01      The power market served by NEB has had a long history of steady
growth. The average annual increase in total sales from FY1965 through
1974 was 14.5%. Energy sales for the next seven years (1975-1981) are
expected to increase at an average around 14.0% per annum, .17.6% in 1975
then gradually levelling off to 10.8% by 1981. Annex 7 shows the actual and
forecast sales of energy. The system maximum demand in FY 1974 was 604 MW.
It is forecast to increase to 1721 MW by FY 1981. Annexes 8 and 9 give a
tabulation and chart of the system load requirements and the capabilities
available to meet these demands. The Prai Extension is the only possible
development that can be completed in time to meet the system load require-
ments, particularly energy.
Least Cost Solution
5.02      Preece, Cardew and Rider, NEB's consultants on system study, have
made extensive studies of the generation and transmission expansion program
coveriag the period from 1975 through 1983. The least cost sequence out of
25 alternatives following Port Dickson Stage III (3 x 120 MW) is given below
in chronological order of development:



- 16 -
(a) to develop Temengor Hydroelectric Project (4 x 87 MW)
which is now under construction, scheduled for com-
pletion in FY 1978 for the first three units and in
FY 1979 for the fourth unit;
(b) to extend the Prai Thermal Power Station by installing
three additional 120 MW units, to be brought into
service in FY 1979 for No. 4 unit and No. 5 and No. 6
units in FY 1980;
(c) to develop a new thermal power station in the
south at Pasir Gudang with 2 x 120 MW units,
scheduled for completion in FY 1981; and
(d) to develop new hydro sites on the east coast,
the sequence of which is still subject to further
optimization pending completion of field in-
vestigations and feasibility studies.
5.03      The two rural distribution projects were compared with their
diesel alternatives by assuming a conservative growth rate of 5% p.a.
Extension of transformer capacity and diesel installation consistent with
the load growth as well as necessary replacement have been taken into
consideration. The discount rates which make the present worth of cost
streams of bulk supply to two rural areas breakeven with those of diesel
alternatives are:
(a)  Labis/Chaah area - 15.45%      (assuming 1/3 of the cost of

allocated to the bulk supply)
(b)  Lana Bulu Area   - 13.75%
Return on Investment
5.04      The internal rate of return of Prai Extension or the discount
rate at which the present worth of costs attributable to the Project, ex-
cluding duties and taxes, is equal to that of the benefits from it over its
life is 11% in constant value terms (see Annex 10).
5.05      Based on the power development program from 1977 through 1983
which includes two major hydroelectric projects and two thermal power projects,
the system incremental cost of energy per Kwh is estimated to be Mi 10.8 on
a constant price basis, using a discount rate of 10% (Annex 11). Average
price is estimated to be Mi 10.4 per Kwh sold by the end of the forecast
period. This indicates that a tariff increase may require consideration
later in the current decade.

VI.  FIN.ANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Results and Financial Position
6.01      During the period FY 1966-1973 policies followed by Government
enabled NEB to maintain a sound financial position. The rate of return on
acceptably valued net fixed assets in operation rose from a minimium of d.8%
in FY 1969 to 11.9% in FY 1973; the Debt/Equity ratio improved from 61/39
in FY 1966 to 48/52 in FY 1973.  During FY 1974 finances weke affected by
NEB's inability to recover fuel price increases but the rate of return at
10.2% still comfortably exceeded the 8% agreed with the Bank. For FY 1974
the debt/equity ratio was 47/53 and debt service coverage on an annual
basis was 2.3 times. Income Statements and Balance Sheets for FY 1966 through
1974 are shown in Annexes 12 and 13.
Financial Forecasts
6.02      NEB's financial forecasts show that internal cash generation
available for construction will not continue at the high level of about
60% achieved in past years; a contribution of 25% after covering all
requirements, is estimated for the period FY 1975 through 1981. Although
the Malaysian dollar has been revalued upwards by about 23% againsL the
US dollar since currency parities began changing irn 1971, increased equip-
ment and construction costs, acceleration of the construction program to
meet increased load growth and inflation will combine to make NEB's cash
generation insufficient to cover all local costs. Additional local funds
will be necessary for the first time since FY 1969. Forecast Tariff and
Revenue Analysis, Income, Funds Statements and Balance Sheets for FY 1975-81
are shown in Annexes 14, 15, 16 and 17.
6.03      The total construction program FY 1975-81 is estimated to amount
to M$3,079 million (US$1,338 million) including interest during construction
and after escalation at 12%, 10%, 8% and 7% for 1975, 1976, 1977-79 and
1980-81 respectively for the foreign portion of civil works and equipment and
at an average of 7-1/2% annually for local costs. A rate of 7-1/2% has
been used for operating costs other than fuel oil. Construction cost
estimates which are reasonable are based on figures used by the consultants
(Preece, Cardew and Rider) in the system study to arrive at the most economic
sequence of system expansion. Forecast load and energy growth used in the
study was agreed by NEB and its Consultants and is acceptable (para. 5.01).

6.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million equivalent would cover
about 20% of project cost. The balance of US$136 million equivalent will be
financed from bilateral sources or suppliers credits and internal cash
generation. The project represents 13% of NEB's FY 1975-81 construction
expenditure program, as shown above. The detailed construction expenditure
program is shown in Annex 18.
6.06      No difficulty is anticipated in NEB raising suppliers' credits or
other assumed foreign loans to meet the expenditure program. Additional
local funds of US$295 million equivalent are estimated to be required during
the 7-year period FY 1975-1981. These have been assumed as equity in the
financing plan. General assurances were obtained during negotiations that
Government will provide, or cause NEB to be provided with, the funds required
to complete the construction program and specific assurances were also
obtained regarding the provision of funds to complete the project.
Future Operating Results
General
6.07      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 3,502 GWh in FY 1974
to 8,869 GWh in FY 1981, an average annual growth rate of about 14%. Revenue
per kWH is forecast to average about MJ9.8 (US$44.3) during the forecast
period. Revenues are forecast to increase from M$292 million (US$127 mil-
lion) in FY 1974 to M$929 million (US$404 million) in FY 1981, an average
annual growth rate of 18%; operating expenses are forecast to increase
from M$220 million (US$96 million) in FY 1974 to M$721 million (US$313 mil-
lion) in FY 1981, at an average growth rate of 20% indicating that a tariff
increase may require consideration later in the 'seventies (see Annex 19
for assumptions in the financial forecasts).
Rate of Return
6.08      The rate of return on acceptably valued average net fixed assets
in operation isestimated to vary between 8.2% (FY 1979) and 11.5% (FY 1980).
Currently the rate of return covenant with the Bank provides for a minimum
of 8% and it was agreed during negotiations to continue this rate for the
proposed loan.
Debt/Equity
6.09 .   On the assumption that all foreign expenditures are borrowed and
that the remaining funds NEB requires during the forecast period are provided
through retained earnings and equity, NEB's capital structure will remain
satisfactory. The debt/equity ratio will vary from 48/52 in FY 1975 to
52/48 in FY 1981, the last year of the forecast period.
Operating Ratio
6.10      An increasing trend from 69% (FY 1974) to 78% (FY 1981) due to
inflation and an increasing proportion of thermal generation, is forecast



- 20 -
for 'he operating ratio, 1/ again indicating that tariff revision may need
to b< considered during the forecast period.
Current Ratio
6.11      The current ratio, the ratio of current assets to current lia-
bilities, has varied in the past between 0.7 (FY 1966) and 1.8 (FY 1971).
It is estimated to fall to 1.1 in FY 1977 and increase to 1.4 by FY 1981.
Current assets include estimated adequate working cash through the forecast
period and NEB has additional short-term borrowing facilities of M$15 million
(US$6 million). Consumers receivables have been about 1-1/2 months revenue
and have been forecast to continue at this level through FY 1981. Other
receivables have been forecast to increase slightly on the FY 1974 level.
Inventory levels are adequate. The current limitation on short-term borrowing
agreed between the Borrower and the Bank is a maximum of M$20 million. In
order to cover possible short-term cash requirements and in view of the
increased size of NEB's operations, the proposed Loan Agreement provides
that this limit be increased to M$30 million.
Debt Control
6.12      Long-term debt outstanding at the end of FY 1974 was valued at
the currency exchange rates prevailing when loans were drawn. Revaluation
of outstanding loans at rates of exchange ruling on August 31, 1974 would
result in a gain on revaluation of M$20 million. Debt service coverage on
an annual basis will fall progressively through the forecast period, be
greater than 2.2 times for all years through FY 1980 but will fall to 1.8
times by FY 1981, another indication that tariffs may require review later
in the decade. The current debt control covenant provides that, except as
the Bank shall otherwise agree, internal cash generation of the past fiscal
year or a later 12-month period prior to the incurrence of such debt, shall
not be less than 1.5 times future maxiLmum debt service on all debt drawn
down. On this basis, coverage would have been 1.7 times for FY 1974 and
NEB has always met this test in the past. However, this test will not likely
be met in the future and since debt is defined as incurred only at the time
of draw-down, strict application of the covenant would require the Bank's
agreement to every debt drawing to be made in future years. It was agreed
during negotiations to define debt as incurred at the time any loan agreement
is signed and in view of the effect this change will have on the calculation
of the ratio, to lower the minimum coverage to 1.3 times, a still reasonable
test. A schedule of debt is shown in Annex 20.
Receivables
6.13      NEB has no consumers in serious arrears.  NEB takes deposits from
consumers as security for outstanding bills which amounted to M$27 million
I/   Operating costs (before tax) x 100/Gross Revenue.



- 21 -
at end FY 1974. Bank guarantees in lieu of deposits were also held for
M$-18 million which together with deposits, exceeded consumers receivables
and unbilled energy by about M$4 million.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreements were reached on the following
points and appropriate covenants included in the agreement for the proposed
loan:
(a) tariff changes (para. 3.08);
(b)  industrial participation (para. 3.14);
(c)  rate of return (para. 6.08); and
(d)  short-term borrowing (para. 6.11).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$35 million
equivalent to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya for
a period of 20 years incuding a grace period of 5 years.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Rural Electrification Study
1.        The purpose of the study will be to identify the problems of
supplying electric power to all rural areas of Peninsular Malaysia.
2.        Inter alia the study should:
(i) review the achievements of NEB's past electrification
programs in rural areas;
(ii) forecast load, energy and consumer growth of existing
and future rural electrification schemes;
(iii) estimate capital and operating costs;
(iv) estimate the cash deficits that will be incurred until
cash breakeven is reached; and
(v) calculate the overall economic internal rate of return
of the program.
3.        Agricultural and regional development schemes should be studied;
the report should recommend long-term plans for the transmission and distri-
bution system for these schemes.
4.        Problems of existing public license systems should be addressed
and recommendations made whether NEB acquire such systems.
5.        Criteria to be used for the selection of areas and villages to be
electrified should be suggested.
6.        Family incomes should be studied to establish the threshold incomes
necessary for domestic supply.
7.        NEB's current method of levying consumers' contribution shouid be
reviewed.
8.        Technical standards of rural electrification should be reviewed.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
9.        A long-term plan should be produced to serve as a guide to sound,
orderly and more rapid development of rural electrification. The plan
should identify schemes and/or areas for implementation in the short term
of the next 5 years.
10.       The study should also recommend the organization structure and
staffing plan for a Rural Electrification Section.

Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
1.   REVENUES
Supplies to PRHE and Penang have been projected on the basis of
current contracts. The fuel variation charge on tariffs has been assumed to
apply to all areas of Western Malaysia, recovering about 100% of projected
fuel cost increases except for FY 1975 when about 54% will be recouped. The
fuel surcharge has been projected at the following average rates:
Actual
Fiscal Years         1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981
Average MWkWh        2.79   2.86   2.98   2.38   2.48   3.97   4.06   3.97
2.   FUEL COSTS
Fuel oil prices from April 1975 1/ have been estimated as follows:
(a) M$89.00 per ton for Port Dickson power station through
FY 1978 and at M$204 per ton thereafter;
(b) M$204 per ton for other thermal stations;
(c) M$235 per ton for heavy diesel fuel; and
(d) M$1.25 per gallon for low speed diesel fuel.
3.   CUSTOMS AND OTHER DUTIES
NEB is assumed to be subject to fuel oil duties, customs duty,
surtax and sales tax from April, 1975.
1/   Actual costs are incorporated in the forecasts through March, 1975.



ANNEX 19
Page 2
4.   OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATION
Forecast operation, maintenance and administration is based on
a detailed analysis of cost per kWh sold by each station for the first six
months of FY 1975 escalated at an average of 7-1/2% per annum.
5.   CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURE
Construction expenditures have been escalated as follows:
Years          Foreign Costs         Local Costs
1975                 12%                 7-1/2%
1976                 10%                 7-1/2%
1977-79               8%                 7-1/2%
1980-81               7%                 7-1/2%
6.   DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is on the straight line method and averages about
3.3% of gross plant.
7.  CORPORATION TAX
Corporation tax has been assumed at the current rate of 40% of
annual net profit adjusted in accordance with the Tax Act. Liability varies
substantially each year due to the effect accelerated depreciation allowances
given by the Tax Act on the commissioning of plant.
8.   FORECAST EXTERNAL SOURCES
Projected borrowings and other sources are assumed on the
following terms:
(i)  the proposed IBRD loan of M$69 million (US$30 million)
assumed to be at 8-1/2% for terms of 20 years including
5 years of grace;
(ii)  balances to be drawn on IBRD loans 700-MA and 1031-MA
amounting to M$128 million (US$56 million) at interest
rates of 7% and 7-1/4% each for terms of 20 years
including 5 years of grace;
(iii)  agreed bilateral and suppliers credits totalling M$158
million (US$69 million) at interest rates varying from
5% to 7.05% with repayment periods ranging from 8 to 20
years;



ANNEX 19

(iv)  assumed borrowings of M$1,273 million (US$553 million)
at 8-1/2% interest rate for periods of 20 years including
5 years of grace;
(v)  assumed equity investment by Government of M$680 million
(US$296 million) at a dividend rate of 5%, less tax; and
(vi)  contributions from consumers towards the cost of non-
viable installations and from Federal and State Governments
towards the cost of rural electrification, amounting to
M$91 million (US$40 million).
