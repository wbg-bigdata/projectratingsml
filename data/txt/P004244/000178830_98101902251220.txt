REPORT AND RECOFMENDATION OF THE PRFSIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD
OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
VTITH THE GUARANTEE OF MALAYSIA
FOR A SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) with
the guarantee of Malaysia for the equivalent of US$35 million to help fi-
nance a seventh power project. The loan would have a term of 20 years in-
cluding 5 years of grace with interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report (No. 653-MA) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in March 1975. The population of Mlalaysia in 1974 was
about 12 million, growing at a rate of 2.7 percent per annum. Detailed
country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GNP of US$490 (1973), Malaysia is one of the
most prosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia. The economy has
maintained fairly high rates of real growth, with the GNP growing at an
average rate of about 6 percent a year during the last decade. The country's
economy achieved remarkable growth in 1973 with real national income im-
proving by 17 percent. The balance of payments position deteriorated con-
siderably during 1974, but the economy still maintained a relatively high
level of activity, and GNP showed 6.3 percent growth in real terms. The
overall balance of payments had about US$196 million surplus in 1974, thus
adding further to Malaysia's external reserves, which equaled about five
months of net imports at present levels.
4.        Rubber continues to be the main pillar of the Malaysian economy,
contributing about 30 percent of export earnings and 17 percent of GDP, but
considerable progress has been made in reducing the dependence on rubber
exports through diversification of exports to timber, tin, palm oil and
petroleum products. In 1973 Malaysia's production of crude petroleum was
about 100,000 barrels per day, or 4.5 million long tons a year. In a few
years, production is expected to increase three to four-fold. In 1973
Malaysia became a net exporter of petroleum products and, as production
increases, petroleum will soon become an important foreign exchange earner.
Substantial reserves of natural gas are also available and by 1979 Malaysia
is expected to start exporting significant quantities of liquefied natural
gas, further strengthening the country's balance of payments position.
5.        Malaysia's conservative fiscal and monetary management has con-
siderably enhanced the country's financial standing. Public sector revenues
have been growing rapidly, mainly as a result of vigorous taxation efforts,



- 2 -
and the ratio of total government revenue to GNP is now over 20 percent.
Conservative financial policies are also reflected in the relatively low
level of external public debt and the very low ratio of debt service pay-
ments.
6.        During the last two years, inflation has emerged as Malaysia's
primary economic concern. After a decade of remarkable price stability
(with consumer prices rising' on an average of only 1 percent per annum),
domestic prices began to show a noticeable upward trend in 1973. Average
consumer prices in 1972 were 3.2 percent higher than in 1971 but they
jumped 10.5 percent in 1973. In 1974 prices rose another 18 percent. Price
pressures have been the result of both imported inflation and rapid Increases
in domestic demand. However, 1Malaysia has not been adversely affected by
the higher price of petroleum. On the contrary, Malaysia should benefit
from it in the long term.
7.        During the last several years, the Government's long-term planning
has concentrated on reducing the economic disparity between the Malays, who
account for a little over half the population, and non-Malays of whom about
70 percent are Chinese. The average income of the Malays is about half
that of the Chinese. Over the next 20 years the Government aims to eradicate
poverty and to restructure society so that the present identification of race
with economic status will be eliminated. The basic outlines of the New
Economic Policy, announced :[n June 1971, allow for continued growth for each
of the principal ethnic groups while enlarging economic opportunities for
Malays.
8.        The Second lialaysia Plan (1971-75) indicates the Government's
determination to step up the development effort in the public sector. The
improvement in the Government's capacity to execute projects resulted in
expenditures during the first three years of the Plan period that already
exceeded the original plan allocation of US$2 billion. The revised Plan of
US$4 billion anticipates a further strengthening of project identification
and implementation in the public sector.
9.        During the first three years of the Second Malaysia Plan, total
public sector development expenditures amounted to about US$2.2 billion of
which 50 percent was financed by net domestic borrowing and 16 percent by
net foreign borrowing. The balance was financed largely by surpluses in
the current account. The Bank has provided a little under 40 percent of
foreign loan commitments; loans from the Asian Development Bank and bilateral
aid, mainly from the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, the
Federal Republic of Germany and Japan, provided the rest. For the next five
years disbursements of almost US$1 billion of medium and long term loans
from abroad will be required to permit the level of public investment planned.
To support this inflow, new foreign loan commitments of approximately US$1.8
billion will be required over the five year period. However, while project
loans from multilateral sources, IBRD and ADB, are not expected to decrease,
bilateral assistance from traditional sources (Commonwealth countries and
Japan) is likely to be substantially lower and market borrowing to be on



- 3 -
less favorable terms.   The Govern.ilent has therefore made initial contacts
with a number of OPEC member countries and the first aid commitments have
already been obtained.
10.       Malaysia's development program will continue to require resources
in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for financing
the import component of development projects. The Bans plans therefore to
cover a portion of local costs particularly in agriculture and in other
sectors where the foreign exchange content of projects is small.
11.       The expected level of foreign borrowings is well within Malaysia's
debt servicing capacity. Debt service obligations at present are about 2.5
percent of exports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated to
rise to only about 3 percent during the late 1970s. The Bank's share in
Malaysia's debt service payments is 22 percent and is expected to be about
23 percent by the end of 1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
12.       The Bank has made 29 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport. Although
in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of projects has
generally been satisfactory. As of October 31, 1975, the loans to Malaysia
held by the Bank amounted to US$549.2 million. In addition, the Bank made
a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan 405-MA),
guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The amount
held by the Bank under that loan as of October 31, 1975, was US$4.6 million.
Eleven loans are fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of.
Bank loans and IFC investments, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
13.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is in line with the country's New
Economic Policy, which aims at eliminating imbalances in income distribution,
particularly between rural and urban populations. Since Malaysia's agricultural
programs, including land development, irrigation and agricultural credit, pro-
vide the most effective Government instruments for tackling unemployment and
income imbalances, the Bank will continue to give financial support to these
programs. The Bank will also continue to assist in the financing of the
infrastructure development. The Bank has helped the Government to prepare
projects either in the course of its lending operations or by acting as
Executing Agency for UNDP-financed studies. The Bank has also helped to
strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out important parts of
Malaysia's investment program. The Bank will continue this policy, which
will be reflected in the loans to be presented to the Executive Directors
in the next year or so. These loans would be for projects involving rural
development, public utilities, urban transport and other infrastructure
development.



- 4 -
14.       At present the Bank is also assisting in the preparation of the
Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80), both in the preparation of sector programs
and in the review of overall economic objectives and policies. The Third
Malaysia Plan is expected to be announced in March 1976.
15.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made five
investments totaling US$8.69 million (Annex II). The total commitments
under those investments held by IFC as of October 31, 1975, amounted to
US$1.8 million.
PART III - ELECTRIC POWER IN MALAYSIA
The Sector
16.       Hydroelectric potential is the most valuable indigenous energy
resource for power, and the development of this resource is being actively
pursued. Over the last ten years, demand for electric power has been grow-
ing by about 14 percent annually. Industry and mining were the largest users
of power in 1974, followed by commercial and residential consumers. Power
is supplied principally by autonomous government-owned entities, the largest
being the National Electricity Board (NEB). NEB serves Peninsular Malaysia
with the exception of part of the State of Perak, which is supplied by the
privately-owned Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE), and of Penang,
which is supplied by municipally-owned plants. The Sabah Electricity Board
and the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation supply the two states on the
island of Borneo. Total capacity installed by these entities at present is
1,194 MW, of which NEB accounts for about 861 MW. In addition, there is a
total of about 21.4 MW of 117 diesel plants owned by small electric companies,
which supply power to customers on a licensed basis, and of about 158 MW of
small privately owned diesel units.
17.       The power market served by NEB has grown steadily in the past
decade with a 16 percent average annual increase in total sales from FY63
through FY69, and a 13 percent average annual increase from FY70 through
FY73. Energy sales for the next seven years are expected to increase at an
average rate of 14 percent per annum, starting with an 18 percent growth rate
in FY75 and then gradually leveling off to 11 percent by FY81.
18.       PRHE, incorporated in the United Kingdom, operates under a con-
cession granted by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years. The
Government has decided to exercise its right to take over under the con-
cession agreement and NEB is expected to acquire the company's assets in
November 1976. The Penang City Council operates the electricity system for
the island of Penang under special provisions of the Electricity Act of
1949. The system is interconnected with the NEB system. No further
generating units will be added by PRHE or Penang and the increase in future



-5-
demand will be met by bulk purchases from NEB.   Thus, in the future only
NEB will supply all electricity generated from plants in Peninsular Malaysia
except for the supply from minor licensed plants.
19.       NEB's total generating capacity of 861 MW consists of about 265
MW of hydroelectric plant, 540 MW of steam plant, and 55 MW of diesel plant.
NEB's present expansion program includes the completion of Stage III (3 x
120 MW) of the Port Dickson Thermal Power Station (scheduled for completion
in 1976); the construction of the Temengor Hydroelectric Plant (4 x 87 MW,
scheduled for completion in FY78); and the installation of 3 x 120 MW
additional units at the Prai Thermal Power Station to be brought into service
during 1979-80 under the proposed project.
20.       NEB's interconnected system covers most of the western side of
Peninsular Malaysia. Links to Kuantan, Kota Bahru and Kuala Trengganu on
the east coast will be completed between 1975 and 1980 when the entire
peninsula will be interconnected. Rural electrification, which started
in the '50s,was accelerated under the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75), but
so far the program has not been based on clearly established economic priorities
with villages to be electrified often being selected on a rather arbitrary
basis. The Federal Government, the State Governments and NEB each provide
one-third of the finance for the program, including the coverage of expected
operating losses for the first seven years. Until now, the deficits have
been insignificant in relation to NEB's scale of operations, but with the
increasing pressure for rural electrification, the cash deficits may increase
in the future.
21.       NEB's development program is based on a system study in which a
number of alternative sequences of generating capacity expansion were
compared. The study was carried out by NEB's consultants, Preece, Cardew,
and Rider (PCR). The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority (Australia)
completed a pre-investment study in 1969 of the Pergau hydroelectric scheme;
a group of Russian engineers is carrying out a study of the Sungai Tembeling
scheme; and a study of the combined flood control and power development
project of the Trengganu River is also under way.
22.       Since 1958, NEB has received six Bank loans for power amounting to
about US$181 million (net of cancellations), which is helping to finance
an increase of approximately 1,000 MW in generating capacity and associated
transmission lines. The projects under the first four loans have been
completed and are operating well. Under the fifth loan, for the third stage
extension of the Port Dickson thermal power station and transmission
facilities, delays in the delivery of structural steel have occurred, and
commissioning of the first new unit is now expected to be at the end of 1975,
about 20 months behind the original schedule. Construction of the transmis-
sion lines and sub-stations being financed under the sixth loan is on sched-
ule. The systems in both Sarawak and Sabah are being assisted by ADB loans.



- 6-
The National Electricity Board
23.       The National Electricity Board, which was established in 1949 by
the Government under the provisions of the Electricity Act enacted that year,
is a financially sound, well-organized, and well-operated utility. It is
both a regulatory and operating agency responsible for operating the electric
installations under its jurisdiction and establishing such new facilities
as may be required. It regulates the production and use of electric energy
in Peninsular Malaysia and grants licenses for the installation and operation
of independent electricity works to be used for public or private purposes.
The Board of Directors is appointed by the Minister of Power, Technology
and Research, subject to terms and conditions he may determine. The Board
is headed by a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman, who is also General Manager.
The Loan Agreement (Section 4.02) requires NEB to inform the Bank of the
names and qualifications of persons to be appointed to the positions of
General Manager and Financial Controller.
24.       NEB has a comprehensive staff training program, which is run by
its own Education and Training Department. Construction of a new training
school is scheduled to begin in 1976. In addition to a training program
at the college level, NEB has an apprenticeship scheme for technical staff.
In-house courses are run to train supervisors and others in modern tech-
niques of supervision and methods of work. Senior personnel attend over-
seas seminars, and others are sent abroad for post-graduate study.
25.       NEB has the power to fix tariffs without reference to any other
authority. In practice, however, the Cabinet deliberates on tariff questions
because of their political impact. NEB's stated policy has been to earn a
return on its average net fixed assets in operation of at least 8 percent
per annum and to finance at least 40 percent of construction costs out of
internal resources. The commitment to earn a rate of return of at least
8 percent is incorporated in the Loan Agreement (Section 5.05).
26.       NEB's financial position is sound.    The rate of return on
acceptably valued average net fixed assets in operation has varied between
8.8 percent (1969) and 11.9 percent (1973); for 1974, it was 10.2 percent.
Local construction costs have been wholly met from internal cash generation
since 1969. Debt service coverage on an annual basis was 2.3 (1974). The
debt/equity ratio improved from 61/39 in FY66 to 47/53 in FY74, indicating
a satisfactory capital structure. The current limitation on short-term
borrowing agreed between NEB and the Bank is a maximum of M$30 million (Loan
Agreement, Section 5.07). The limitation on long-term borrowing is provided
by the agreement that the Borrower shall not incur any long-term debt unless
its internal cash generation in the preceding fiscal year or a later 12-
month period prior to the incurrence of such debt shall not be less than
1.3 times future maximum debt service (Loan Agreement, Section 5.06).
27.       NEB is promoting the development of local manufacturing capabil-
ity in electric meters, cables, transformers and switchgear for which NEB
would be the main customer in the early years. A company has already been



- 7 -
formed in which NEB has a 51 percent share.   The Loan Agreement contains
a covenant (Section 5.08) providing for the Bank's concurrence to anv
industrial participation by iNEB, whether in the form of equity, loans or
otherwise, when such participations exceed M$25 million equivalent in
aggregate.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Description
28.       The proposed project consists of the following:
(a)  the final extension of the Prai Thermal Power Station
comprising three units of 120 MW each, scheduled for
service in August 1979, February 1980 and August 1980,
respectively;
(b) a 132 kV transmission line from Majadee switching
station to Kota Tinggi, scheduled for service in 1978;
(c) extension of 11 kV distribution system to two rural
areas, scheduled for service in 1978; and
(d) consulting services for a rural electrification study
and other services.
29.       The first stage of the Prai Thermal Power Station (2 x 30 MW)
was completed in 1967 under Loan 350-MA.   The second stage (1 x 30 MWSf) was
completed in 1971 under Loan 579-MA. The site is adequate to accommodate
three additional 120 MW units. The units will be almost identical with
only minor modifications in specifications to the three units now under
construction at Port Dickson Therrnal Station (Loan 700-MA).
30.       The 132 kV transmission line from Majadee switching station to
Kota Tinggi (16.5 miles; see map) is proposed for the purpose of aug-
menting the supply to the district of Kota Tinggi, and later to the Johore
Tenggara regional development area, with a population of 61,500 (1970 census).
The maximum demand in 1974 at Kota Tinggi was 710 kW. It is forecast to
grow at an average annual rate of about 13 percent over the next ten years.
The existing 22 kV overhead line is reaching the limit of its capacity and
frequent breakdowns have been experienced on this line due to liglhtning.
corrosion, etc. A new dnuble circuit 132 kV line is therefore planned which
will initially be operated at 66 kV with the provision for future extension
into the Johore Tenggara development area.
31.       The 11 kV 1istribution sub-projects are designeri to supply power
to two rural areas, one located near Alor Star in the north and the other
located between Seg-amat and Kluang (see map) in the south. The 66 kV line



- 8 -
from Segamat to Kluang (financed under Loan 1031-MA) strengthened the southern
network by completing the 66 kV loop. The present distribution sub-projects
involve mainly 11 kV cables, 11 kV/0.4 kV distribution transformer, 11 kV
switchgear, low voltage cables and overhead mains.
32.       A consultant's study would be undertaken in West Malaysia to
formulate a rural electrification plan and identify its technical,
economic and financial implications.
Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$171.3
million including about US$120 million in foreign exchange. Basic estimates
are at mid-1975 prices, after allowing for increases in materials and equipment
costs and field conditions. Physical contingencies of about 10 percent for
civil works and 5 percent for plant and equipment are included. Price
contingencies of 12 percent for 1975, 10 percent for 1976, 8 percent for
1977-79 and 7 percent after 1980 have been included to cover price escalation
in all foreign cost components of civil works and equipment. The rate of
price escalation for local costs is assumed to be 7-1/2 percent per annum.
34.       The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million would cover about 20 per-
cent of the total project cost (US$171.3 million). The local cost (estimated
at US$51.4 million) would be financed from NEB's internal cash generation.
The proposed Bank loan would finance about 30 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the project, including mainly the ancillary electrical and mechanical
equipment, a portion of the civil works, the distribution lines and consult-
ing services. The balance of the foreign exchange cost (estimated at
US$84.9 million, which is mainly for boilers and turbo-generators) would
be financed through bilateral or suppliers' credits to be arranged by the
Malaysian Government. NEB and the Government were successful in arranging
all such credits needed in the past. Although the availability of bilateral
aid is expected to be more limited in the future (see para. 9), there exists
at present a bilateral credit of Can$50 million equivalent to the Malaysian
Government from the Candian International Development Agency (CIDA). Out
of this amount, only Can$12.5 million equivalent have so far been used.
The Malaysian Government mnay use this credit to cover part of the remaining
foreign exchange cost if Canadian bids are competitive with international
market prices.
Implementation
35.       NEB will be responsible for the implementation of the project.
A local firm, Malaysia International Consultants (MINCO), has been engaged
by NEB to provide engineering services on detailed investigation, design
and construction supervision for civil works of Prai Thermal Power Station
Extension Project. Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of London has been re-
tained by NEB to furnish back-up consultancy services during the design
stage including the review of bidding documents and engineering designs,



- 9 -
and to provide overall supervision during construction through the appoint-
ment of a senior resident engineer. These arrangements are required under
the Loan Agreement (Section 3.02(a), (b)). Engineering and design for the
transmission and distribution sub-projects will be done by NEB's own staff.
36.       Civil works for the Prai Thermal Power Plant extension other than
steelworks and chimney will be awarded to local contractors after competitive
bidding. Equipment will be installed by suppliers on a supply-and-erection
basis. Civil works for the transmission and distribution sub-projects are
expected to be done by local contractors under the supervision of NEB.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       The equipment and materials to be financed under the proposed
loan would be procured through international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Local manufacturers will be
given a 15 percent preference margin or the customs duties, whichever is less.
Civil works to be financed by the Bank (steelworks and chimney, representing
approximately 25 percent of the total cost of civil works) would also be
contracted through international competitive bidding.
38.       Disbursements for the proposed Bank loan would be made against
(i) 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment and ma-
terials; (ii) 100 percent of the ex-factory cost of equipment and materials
manufactured locally; (iii) 70 percent of the expenditures for imported
equipment and materials procured locally; (iv) 100 percent of the foreign
exchange component of civil works; and (v) 100 percent of the foreign
exchange component of consulting services.
Justification
39.       Consultants' studies of NEB's system expansion program have
demonstrated that the sequence of projects as proposed is the least cost
solution to meet the load requirement up to 1983. It includes the Temengor
Hydroelectric Development, the Prai Thermal Power Station extension, and the
associated transmission and distribution sub-projects. The economic justi-
fication of the two distribution sub-projects has been demonstrated by a
comparative study with their diesel alternatives. These projects are less
costly than their diesel alternatives for discount rates up to 13 and 15
percent respectively.
40.       The internal rate of return of the Prai Thermal Power Plant ex-
tension is approximately 11 percent.
Financial Forecast
41.       The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation
during the project period is estimated to exceed 8 percent every year.



- 10 --
Thus. 14EB will satisfy the 13 percent rate of ret:urn covenant incorporated in
the Loan Agreement (Section 5.05).
42.       NEB's financial forecasts show that internal _ash generation will
contribute about 25 percent of estivimated construction expenditure for the
period FY75-81. Assuming that all foreign expenditures are borrowed and
that all local funds required by NEB are provided through retained earnings
and equity, the capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period. The operating ratio is expected to increase from 69
percent in 1974 to 78 percent in 1981. The dlebt service coverage on an
annual basis will be greater than 2.2 tuntil FYSO, and will then fall to
1.8 by FY81.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANDT AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the National Elec-
tricity Board, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank,
the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       Features of special interest in the Loan Agreement are described
in paragraphs 23, 25, 26, 27, 35 and 41 of this Report.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
46.       I recommend that the Executive Dirctors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 533        Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$14.0 Million
Loan of April 17, 1968; Effective Date: August 12, 1968;
Closing I)ate: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 672        Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Effective Date: August 20,
1970; Closing Date: May 31. 1977
Loan No. 885        Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 tillion Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective Date:
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of
62,000 acres of oil palms ancl 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
10,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the project,
operates efficiently, keepirn, high standards of planting and maintenance.
Physical work for the first project (533-MA) has been completed. The re-
maining balance in the loan aumount will be used to finance fertilizers and
interest.  Cost overruns on Bank-financed project components are estimated
at US$3.3 million. Rubber and oil palm planting under the second project
(672-MA) has been completed and village development is proceeding satisfac-
torily. Cost overruns on Bank-financed project components are estimated at
about US$5.5 million. Under the third project (885-MA) oil palm and rubber
plantings are slightly behind schedule but are proceeding satisfactorily.
Infrastructure and village development is behind schedule and settlement is
expected to begin in 1976. Cost overruns on Bank-financed project components
are estimated at US$6.8 million. In terms of economic viability, improved
prospects for palm oil and rubber prices have fully compensated for cost
overruns on all three projects.
Loan No. 967        Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million
Loan of February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16,
1974; Closing Date: June 30. 1982
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of the planting of
65,000 acres of oil palm, and settlement of 4,400 families in the State
of Johore. About 40 percent of the oil palm planting program has been
completed. Clearing and planting operations for the rest are proceeding
satisfactorily, but infrastructure and village development is being delayed.
Cost overruns on Bank-financed project components are presently estimated
to exceed US$10 million, but the economic rate of return of the project has
remained satisfactory. Coordination between FELDA and the Johore Tenggara
Development Authority is good.

Loan of October 3. 1974; Effective Date: January 9.
1975; Closing Date: June 30. 1983
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of the planting of
55,000 acres of oil palm, the settlement of 3,400 families, the construc-
tion of two palm oil mills and the establishment of two urban settlements.
Agricultural development is largely on schedule but the construction of the
settlements is delayed. Pahang Tenggara Development Authority lacks staff
to monitor the economic and administrative development of Keratong town and
it has been difficult to obtain the agreed technical assistance.
Loan No. 973        Western Johore Agricultural Development Project;
US$45.0 Million Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date:
August 14. 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project includes an integrated agricultural development pro-
gram and a provision of drains, coastal embankments and tidal gates to
improve drainage in a total area of 134,000 ha (33,000 ac) in southwest
Peninsular Malaysia. A Project Division has been set up to direct and
coordinate the various agencies involved in project execution, to monitor
and evaluate project progress and to prepare a feasibility study for a
second stage project. Due to the need to re-evaluate some of the design
criteria and the delays in survey contracts, construction is about one
year behind schedule, but prospects remain good for completing the project
on time. The Project Director has assumed office and is obtaining staff,
but the preparation of the agreed Agricultural Development Master Plan for
the agencies involved is taking longer than expected due to lack of basic
data. These data are expected to be available in July, and the Master Plan
should be completed by October 1975.
Loan No. 700         Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16. 1970; Effective Date: September 29. 1970;
Closing Date: January 31, 1977
The project (the third stage extension of Port Dickson Thermal
Power Station consisting of 3 x 120 MW units) was about 39 percent complete
at the end of June 1975. The commissioning date of No. 5 unit is now
scheduled for December 1975, about 20 months behind the original schedule
as a result of prolonged delays in delivery of structural steel. The problem
has now been solved, however, as all of the structural steel has been delivered
to the site. The Government of Malaysia allowed the National Electricity
Board to apply the fuel surcharge to commercial and industrial consumers
from March 15, 1975. Energy sales increased by 11.3 percent in FY74. Rate
of return was 10.2 percent and self-financing of construction was 70 percent.
NEB's sound financial position was maintained in FY74. A rate of return of
8.3 percent is anticipated for FY75, which can be accepted in view of the fact
that the fuel surcharges will apply for only 5.5 months of the fiscal year.
Rates of return greater than 8 percent (8.2 - 13.6 percent) are predicted
for FY76 through FY80.

July 25. 1974; Effective Date: October 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30 19o0
The project consists of transmission lines required for the
Temengor hydroelectric power station. So far implementation is on schedule.
Loan No. 753         Second Telecorununications Project; US$18.7 Million
Loan of June 21, 1971; Effective Date: August 18. 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The program of expansion has been revised to meet the current
estimates of requirement. Procurement of goods required for the project is
progressing satisfactorily. About 45,000 lines of local exchange and 12,000
lines of long-distance exchange equipment have been installed. The project
is expected to be completed by June 1977, about one and a half years behind
schedule.
Loan No. 908         Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Projegt; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30. 1978
The project consists of a construction of an earth dam on the
Langat River and an expansion of the water supply network to parts of Kuala
Lumpur and Klang Valley. After a series of field surveys, the consultant
found that the height of the dam originally planned (175 feet) lhad to be
raised by nine feet. The completion of the dam (but not of the other com-
ponents of the project) is expected to be delayed by about one year until
late 1978. The project cost is presently estimated at about 45 percent more
than the appraisal estimates due to the increased cost of the dam and adop-'
tion of a higher allowance for inflation.
Loan No. 774         Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Effective Date: August 24, 1971;
Closing Date: Mfarch 31, 1976
Recent increases in prices of materials, and variation orders are
expected to raise the project cost from the forecast i1S67 million to M$83
million. Construction of the ports at Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu is
expected to be completed by end 1975 but some buildings will not be com-
pleted until mid-1976. Operating efficiency has remained constant but over-
all traffic which increased in 1973 declined slightly (about 6 percent) in
1974.
Loan No. 799         Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11,
1972; Effective Date: April 17, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Altlhough procurement started late, all the equipment to be procured
has been ordered. The overall cost of revised investment plan (1971-1975)



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8 pages
(about M$93 million) is less than the forecast of M$128 million due to deletion
and deferment of two items. With the delay in procurement, work on track
renewal, workshops and rolling stock will be carried over into the first
year of the next five year plan. Nanagement lacks effectiveness largely
due to many vacancies in key technical posts and to imminent retirement of
several senior officers. Operations have not improved to the extent fore-
cast at appraisal.   Passenger traffic continues to rise faster than antici-
pated. Freight traffic remains relatively stagnant, but considerable
improvement is expected next year, due largely to increased cement traffic.
With increasing costs, operating losses continued to rise in 1973 and 1974.
Even if the MR's request for a 10 percent raise in passenger fares is
granted promptly, there will be further losses in 1975. New investment
proposed by the MR for the Third Five Year Plan (1976-1980) totals 14$393
million; adoption of such a plan will depend on the Government's decision
on the future status of the railway, particularly in view of the rapid
expansion of highways and highway transport.    To assist in making a decision
on the future of the Railway, and on further investment needed, the Govern-
ment wishes to update the General Transport Survey of 1969.
Loan No. 851         Kuala Lumpur   Urban Transport Project US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Effective Date: September 20, 1972;
Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve the transport facilities be-
tween Kuala Lumpur and the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. It consists of
improvement of about 6 miles of Federal Route 2, including detailed engineer-
ing, widening of the road, construction of interchanges and cycle tracks, and
relocation of services. Civil works are 4-6 months behind schedule, due to
shortcomings in the contractor's project management and due to difficulties
in obtaining steel and cement. The major problems have now been overcome
and the civil works contract period has been extended 4 months, until
December 31, 1976. The project also includes a transport study for
metropolitan Kuala Lumpur (completed), a national road maintenance study
(draft final report completed) and detailed engineering of about 137 miles
of Federal Route 1 (completed).
Loan No. 931         Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of
August 22, 1973: Effective Date: October 25. 1973;
Closing Date: August 31, 1977
Construction delays were encountered due to weak management of
some contractors, late delivery of construction equipment, late acquisition
of land and approval by the Government of import licenses and work permits
for the contractors' expatriate staff. However, measures have been taken to
overcome most of these deficiencies, and work, including supervision by
consultants, is proceeding satisfactorily, except for one road section
for which contractor management has to be strengthened. Due to the late
start of the fifth and last road section, project completion may be delayed
by up to 20 months. Construction costs have escalated sharply and it is



ANliNEX II
Page 7 of 8 pages
likely that they will exceed original estimates (including contingencies)
by almost US$17 million, or over 50 percent. The urban studies financed
under the project have been completed. Two feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for future road construction projects, were started
early in 1975.
Loan No. 599        Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23, 1969;
Effective Date: September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
June 30. 1976
Out of 21 project shcools, 20 have been completed, and the quality
of the completed buildings is good. A new site was necessary for one
remaining agricultural school, for which construction is not expected to
be completed before mid-1976. Disbursements have been slow mainly because
of administrative delays in the Public Works Departmient.
Loan No. 810        Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5. 1972; Effective Date: July 7. 1972;
Closin iDate: December 31. 1977
Project implementation is about 12 months behind schedule mainly
due to delays in the appointment of consultant architects for the Penang
University, but it is now improving. Final drawings and tender documents
for the science schools of the Penang University are almost complete and
contracts for the Curriculwu Development Center and six schools have been
awarded. The revised cost estimate shows an increase of about 40 percent
in the project cost over the appraisal estimate. Progress on equipment
procurement is satisfactory.
Loan No. 974         Third Education Project; US$19.0 I-illion Loan of
April 5. 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Project implementation is about three months behind schedule
due to delays in selection of sites for the Teacher Training Colleges (TTC)
but all sites have now been selected or acquired except the one for
Ipoh TTC. Tender documents have all been completed for 8 of 13 project
institutions and sketch plans for the remaining five have been approved.
Progress on civil works, equipment procurement and ETV component is now
satisfactory. Estimated total project cost remains the same as the
appraisal estimate. Disbursement is slow due to delays in the procurement
of ETV equipment but should improve since most of ETV equipment either
have been or will be tendered soon. The project unit is functioning
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 880        Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of
February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 21. 1973;
Closin& Date: September 30, 1978
There has been a noticeable improvement in the progress of the
civil works component of the project since last December. The National

Family Planning Board (NFPB) has recently accepted most of the important
recommendations of the management study, including the setting up of a
computerized management information system. The Senior Research Advisor
to assist the NFPB in evaluation and research work will join shortly.
Two communications advisors are in the field. 11owever, the information
education and communication program is proceeding at a low key due to
political problems that constrained the program improvements considerably.
