INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON   A
PROPOSED LOAN TO EMPRESA AGUADORA DE MANAGUA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF NICARAGUA
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Empresa Aguadora de Managua with the guarantee of the Republic of
Nicaragua for the equivalent of $6.9 million to help finance a water supply
project. The loan would have a term of 24 years, including 3 1/2 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.       Nicaragua has to date received fifteen Bank loans and one IDA
credit, totalling $62.9 million net of cancellations. Seven loans, totalling
$42.L million, have been made for power; three loans, totalling $10.2 million,
for transportation; one loan,amounting to $h.0 million, for education; four
loans, totalling $3.3 million, for agriculture, and a credit, amounting to
$3.0 million, for a water supply project. The last operation, a loan for
power, was signed in June 1968. In addition to the proposed loan, the Bank
expects to make a loan of about $20 million for power in FYi972.
3.       As of January  31, 1972, a total of about $6.0 million remained
to.-be disbursed on two loans, one for education and one for power. The
eaucation project (Loan 532-NI) had a very slow start, mainly because of
initial financing and management problems which seem now to be solved.
Although we expect disbursements to pick up over the next few months, the
original closing date will have to be postponed. The power project (Loan
543-NI), which includes facilities in Managua and Santa Barbara, is nearing
completion. Owing largely to delays in delivery of equipment, installation
of a thermal unit in Managua fell some fifteen months behind schedule, but
difficulties have now been solved and the project as a whole is expected to
be completed on time.
II.      IFC has made one investment in Nicaragua, in 1968, in a new cotton
and synthetic fiber textile company (FABRITEX), consisting of a $1 million
loan (fully disbursed) and an equity participation of about $1 million.   IFC
is presently assessing the Company's need for additional financing. The
possibility of other operations in the country is under review.
5.       A summary of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments is in
Annex I.

PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.          A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Nicaragua" was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 27, 1971.
Basic data on the economy are in Annex II.
7.          Nicaragua's economic fortunes have been traditionally linked
to fluctuations in the production and export of one or two commodities.
Over the last five decades Nicaragua has developed from a banana to a coffee
and then, more recently, to a cotton econamy. This great dependence on one
or two export commodities and a high import coefficient have resulted in
recurrent balance of payments crises which have limited Nicaragua's ability
to develop its ample agricultural resources.
8.       A rapid increase in cotton production for export allowed Nicaragua's
economy to grow at about 10 percent annually in current prices during 1961-67.
Inflation was negligible during this period, and real per capita income
increased at about 6 percent per year or about twice as fast as population
growth. The establishment of a Central American Common Market in the early
sixties stimulated rapid growth of industrial exports, and a large increase
in meat sales to the United States also contributed to the diversification
of Nicaragua's exports. None the less, the economy remained dependent on
cotton. Between 1966 and 1970 cotton production fell sharply, after
extension into marginal lands had created unmanageable pest control problems.
The decline of cotton was only partially offset by the growth of other
exports and real per capita income stagnated in 1966-69. Economic growth
recovered in 1970, mainly because of increased coffee prices and stepped up
sales of manufactures to Honduras and Costa Rica. In 1971, however, the
pace of growth slowed down somewhat, as declining coffee prices and regional
sales offset the effects of a marked recovery of cotton exports. Over the
next few years the real growth of GDP is unlikely to exceed 5 percent
annually because of limited export prospects for cotton, coffee, beef and
manufactures, but, if a longer view is. taken, Nicaragua's ample unexploited
resources offer the possibility of sustaining a considerably faster growth.
9.       During the last two years the Government adopted fiscal and
monetary policies aimed at arresting a sharp fiscal and balance of payments
deterioration which the cotton crisis and inadequate policies had brought
about in 1967-69. In May 1970 the Government introduced a 5 percent general
sales tax and raised interest rates to levels more in line with those of the
world money markets. As a result of the fiscal measures, government
current revenues increased sharply in 1970 (17 percent) and continued to
grow substantially in 1971 (10 percent), while the expansion of current
expenditures was limited to about 6 percent in each year. Central govern-
ment savings increased from $4.9 million equivalent in 1969 to $12.7 million
in 1970 and $17 million in 1971. Total public sector savings recovered
from roughly 2 percent of GDP in 1969 to 3 percent in 1970, while public
investment rose from about 4 to 5 percent of GDP, and the gap was financed



-3-
through official external borrowing. The share of public investment financeci
by public savings also increased, from 56 percent in 1969 to 58 percent in
1970. Preliminary esti-mates point to a continuation of this favorable trend
in 1971.  The Government plans to introduce new tax measures in 1972-73,
designed with assistance from the IMF.
10.      Nicaraguas balance of payments also improved in 1970-71.   Net
international reserves -- negative in 1969 -- increased by $13 million in
1970, thanks to increased foreign exchange earnings from coffee and
manufactures, the slower growth of imports, and a stepped up inflow of
long-term foreign loans to the public sector. Net reserves increased further
by $10 million in 1971 to an estimated $15 million at the end of the year
-- equivalent to about 3 weeks current payments -- a level, nevertheless,
which is still low in view of the cyclical instability of Nicaragua's
exports.
11.      Nicaragua's debt service ratio increased frcm about 4 percent
in 1965 to 10 percent in 1970, following a substantial increase in short-
and medium-term borrowing from foreign commercial banks in 1967-68. In
1971 the Government took steps to lengthen the maturity structure of the
debt and, as part of a stand-by arrangement negotiated with the IMF, agreed
to set a limit in 1972 on new external borrowing with maturities of less
than 12 years. Accordingly, the debt service ratio is expected to decline
after outstanding shorter term external liabilities are repaid over the
next three years or so.
12.      The Government is increasingly aware of the need to diversify and
strengthen the economy and is striving to create a suitable administrative
framework. A new Planning Office, established in April 1971, is working
on a five-year development plan for 1972-76. A development fund will be
established shortly within the Central Bank and a project preparation unit
is being developed with assistance fron consultants. This unit is con-
centrating its efforts on projects in agriculture and industry, in agree-
ment with the Government's policy of placing increasing emphasis on the
promotion of projects with a direct impact on production. The Government
also intends to distribute the benefits of development more widely than
in the past, mainly through sizeable investment in social infrastructure,
especially in education and water supply. If the savings effort of the last
two years is sustained and project preparation effectively strengthened,
Nicaragua will continue to deserve external support for its development
programs.
13.      Apart from the Bank, external financing is principally provided
by USAID, the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has made loans for highways,
agriculture, industry, rural electrification, housing, education and health.
IDB is financing water and sewerage, higher education, agriculture and
transport. CABEI is financing projects with a regional impact, principally



in transport and industry. The past lending of these agencies is summarized
below. The size and composition of their lending programs are still un-
certain, but it is likely that they will continue to focus on the sectors
which they financed in the past.

/ Includes some local currency loans.
14.      Loans from these agencies are usually on softer terms than Bank
loans, a factor which limits the Bank's ability to support the Government's
programs in areas of development such as rural electrification and rural
water supply. AID loans are for a term of hO years with interest of 2 to
3 percent, and most IDB loans are extended from the Fund for Special
Operations, carrying 3-4 percent interest rates and terms ranging from 15
to 30 years. The terms of CABEI loans -- which often provide 100 percent
financing of local expenditures -- vary in accordance with CABEI's sources
of financing, but generally contain a substantial concessionary element.
USAID, which held roughly one-third of the debt repayable in foreign currency
at the end of 1971, is Nicaragua's largest external creditor. Liabilities
to the Bank Group represented less than one-fifth of debt repayable in
foreign currency.
15.      In the past, Bank Group lending has been directed mainly towards
the strengthening of economic infrastructure such as power, ports and
roads, and to a lesser extent toward agricultural activities and social
sectors such as water supply and education. Bank lending_was interrupted
in 1969-71 because of inadequate economic policies and lack of suitable
projects, but the resumption of lending is now possible as the country's
developnent effort has materially improved, partly as a result of the
Bank's influence.



- 5 -
16.      For the immediate future, the Bank plans to continue to assist
Nicaragua in those areas where finance frcm other agencies is not available.
Several agricultural operations, in line with the Government's strategy
to put the main thrust of development on the diversification of production,
are being considered. Appraisal of a fisheries project is being
completed. Two FAQ missions visited Nicaragua, in February 1972, to explore
the possibility of Bank financing for livestock and agricultural credit
projects.  A UNDP/UN mission is carrying out ground water investigations
which may result in a project for Bank financing. With respect to ind stry
the Bank is actively expLoring the possibilities for channelling financing
to Nicaragua and the other Central American countries through the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).  The Bank plans to contine
to assist the development of physical and social infrastructure of Nicaragua
in line with the_growth of the econamy.  A seco,d prolqect in secondary
education is expected to be necessary within 2-3 years.  Accordingly, a
UNESCO mission visited Nicaragua in January 1972 to assist the Government
in the preparation of this project. Power demand has increased rapidly in
the sixties and power availability will continue to be important for the
industrialization of Nicaragua. As a result of its efforts to foster power
interconnection in Central America, the Bank expects to negotiate soon loans to
Nicaragua and Honduras for interconnection of their power grids. These
projects are an interim stage prior to the construction of a large hydro-
power project in Honduras, in the late seventies, to serve both countries.
Preparation of a second port project, for the expansion of the Port of
Corinto on the Pacific, is well advanced, and appraisal is planned fot
FY1973.
PART III - THE PROJECT
Sector Background
17.      Nicaragua's water supply system developed during the sixties, and
contributed substantially to improving health conditions. By the end of
the decade, Nicaragua had surpassed the goal set out in the 1961 Charter
of the Alliance for Progress to provide water supply for at least 70 per-
cent of urban population in Latin America. At the end of 1969, about 87
percent of Nicaragua's urban population and 6 percent of its rural pop-
ulation were served by piped water.
18.      The capital city's main supplier of potable water is the Empresa
Aguadora de Managua, which serves about 280,000 people (72 percent of the
city's population) with metered connections, in addition to 5,000 to
10,000 people with community standpipe service.  Independent systems of
governmental and private entities serve the remainder with house connections
and ccnmunity standpipes or wells. Some large industrial users have their
own groundwater sources.



- 6 -
19.      Demand for water in Managua is expected to grow, as in the past,
at about 8 percent per year, mostly as a result of population growth in the
city (about 6 percent per year) and a modest increase of per capita con-
sumption. The latter, about 70 gallons per day, is about the same as in
other cities in Latin America where the Bank has financed water supply
projects. The proposed project is the second stage of a long-range program,
started in 1963, to expand the Empresa's water supply system. Its execution
is essential to prevent deterioration of health conditions in the rapidly
expanding urban community of the capital. In addition, the project would
meet the growing requirements of industrial development around the capital.
A third stage of the long range program for water supply in Managua is
planned for the early eighties.
20.      Responsibility for water supply outside the capital is shared by
municipal governments and an agency of the Ministry of Health, the Water
Supply and Sewerage Department (Departamento Nacional de Acueducto y
Alcantarillado - DENACAL). With financial assistance from IDB, DENACAL
recently completed a $3.3 million program of water supply improvement in
75 small communities, and is planning to invest another $13.6 million in
water supply and sewerage projects for an additional 64 communities and
10 cities between 1972 and 1976. This program includes the acquisition of
some supply systems which municipal governments are now operating with
limited efficiency.
21.      Development of sewerage services in Nicaragua, however, has lagged
behind that of water supply. With only 32 percent of urban population
served by sewerage, Nicaragua is still well below the 70 percent target
set by the Alliance for Progress and the standards reached in most of the
neighboring countries. DENACAL, which is responsible for public sewerage
systems in Nicaragua, will start construction in 1972 of a $8.5 million
expansion of Managua's sewerage system with financial assistance from IDB.
This project includes design and construction of treatment units and a
sewerage outfall to help,relieve the polluted condition of Lake Managua.
Project Entity
22.      Empresa Aguadora de Managua has been a governmental utility since
1932. Although administratively attached to the Ministry of Public Works,
the Empresa operates independently and reports directly to the President of
the Republic. It has its own assets, prepares its budget and generates its
own funds.  The General Manager, appointed by the Government, is responsible
for all managerial and administrative functions. It has a staff of 370.
23.      The Empresa was the beneficiary of IDA Credit 26-NI, in 1962, for
the first water supply project. It completed that project satisfactorily
in 1966, _and attained virtually all institutional objectives which IDA had
sought. It is well managed and water supply operations are efficiently
run. Nevertheless, the Bank can still perform a significant role



-7-
in strengthening the Empresals organization, in line with the expected
expansion of its operations. Thus, the Empresa has agreed to (i) revise
its by-laws, in consultation with the Bank;   (ii)  engage management
consultants to review personnel administration, accounting, inventory
control, computer utilization and internal auditing; and   (iii)  establish
a program of improvements, in consultation with the Bank, based on the
consultants' recommendations.
Project Description and Financing Plan
24.      A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Managua Water Supply
Project, Nicaragua" (No. PU-82a, dated February 9, 1972) is being
distributed separately. The main features of the project are summarized
in Annex III.
25.      The project was appraised in the field in May 1971.  Negotiations
for the proposed loan were held in Washington in January 1972. The Empresa
was represented by Messrs. J. Santos Zelaya, General Manager, Adan Cajina R.,
Director of DENACAL, ALfredo Guerrero, Technical Manager of ENALUF (National
Light and Power Company), and Alejandro Romero C., Legal Advisor. The
Government was represented by Messrs. Felix Hernandez Gordillo, Director
General of the Budget,and Gustavo Escoto-Goenaga, Minister Counsellor of
Economic Affairs of the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington.
26.      The project consists of:
(a) construction of water wells with an aggregate yield of about
17 million gallons per day (including stand-by capacity);
(b) construction of new booster pumping stations with a combined
capacity of about 56 million gallons per day;
(c) construction of two service reservoirs, about 60 kam of trans-
mission mains and about 45 km of distribution pipelines;
(d) installation of about 9,400 service connections;
(e) construction of a new administration building;
(f) acquisition of mobile construction equipnent for water system
maintenance and expansion; and
(g) review and improvement of the Empresa's operation, with the
assistance of management consultants.



- 8 -
The project would be carried out during 1972-74, with the purpose of
(i) increasing the quantity of water available from an average of 2l to
35 million gallons per day (net of stand-by capacity); (ii) doubling,
approximately, the capacity of the transmission network and improving
its operational characteristics; (iii) expanding the distribution network
by about 15 percent to enlarge the area served; (iv)- providing a new
adbministration building to improve office staff efficiency and customer
service. During negotiations the Empresa accepted Bank recommendations
aiming at keeping the building's design, materials and cost within
functional needs.
27.      Total cost of the project is estimated at $10.0 million equivalent.
The proposed loan of $6.9 million would cover the foreign exchange cost
of the project. The project is the main part of the Empresa's $11.8 million
investment program planned for 1972 to 1975, for which a satisfactory
financing plan has been prepared. About 41 percent of the funds required
for this program are expected to be generated from within the EmDresa and
59 percent from the proposed Bank loan.
28.      The project would have no adverse effect on the environment and
appropriate safeguards are planned to protect the Empresa's water sources.
The planned expansion of Managua's sewerage system would provide for
satisfactory disposal of sewerage, including additions resulting from the
proposed water supply project. The Empresa's groundwater sources could be
contaminated by industrial wastes now discharged to the soil and, if the
water table were excessively lowered by overpumping, by infiltration of
poor quality water from Lake Managua. Appropriate action to prevent
possible contamination was agreed upon during negotiations,-and related
provisions have been included in the loan documents.
Financial Position of the Borrower
29.      The Empresa's financial position, which has been improving since
completion of-the 1962 project, is sound and is expected to remain so.
The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation in 1971 to
1973 is expected to be over 7 percent. The Empresa has agreed to maintain
a rate of return of no less than 7 percent during the term of the loan
except for the years 1974 to-1977, when it will maintain a rate of return
of no less than 5 percent. The exception is made because of the sharp
increase in the book value of net fixed assets with the conmiissioning of
new facilities and the rate is adequate to assure the Empresa's financial
viability. An increase of about 10 percent in the average tariff is
expected to be necessary by 1975 to comply with this rate covenant.
30.      The Empresa's debt service ratio is projected to be satisfactory,
dropping to 2.0 when loan amortization begins and recovering to 2.6 by
1978. The Empresa has agreed not to undertake any medium- or long-term
debt without the Bank's prior approval, unless the Empresa's net revenues
would cover debt service by at least 1.5 times.



-9-
Procurement
31.         Goods financed by the Bank would be procured through international
competitive bidding. Suppliers within the Central American Common Market will
receive a preference of 50 percent of existing import duties or 15 percent of
the c.i.f. cost, whichever is the lower.
32.         Nicaraguan firms are expected to be awarded all civil works
contracts, for about $3.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of about $1 million. It is expected that virtually all equipment supply
contracts, in the amount of $5.5 million equivalent, would be awarded to
foreign firms, including up to about $0.2 million to suppliers from other
Central American countries. It is proposed that up to $150,000 be reimbursed
to the Empresa from the proposed loan for expenditures in respect of engineering
and management consulting services that have been incurred between September 1,
1971 and the date of the signing.
Economic Justification
33.      The project is technically sound and economically justified.  The
internal financial rate of return is about 11 percent. This rate understates
the economic return on the project, because benefits to public health and
better fire protection are not fully reflected in the price charged for water.
Furthermore, without the project, the Empresa would either have to refuse to
make new connections to its supply or allow water pressures to fall and, by
1974, begin to interrupt the service -- which, because of possible seepage
of contaminated groundwater into the distribution pipes, could threaten the
potability of the supply.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.           A number of constitutional changes are now under way in
Nicaragua. In August 1971 Congress dissolved itself and granted legislative
powers to the President. In February 1972 a Constituent Assembly was elected
to prepare a new constitution by mid-1974 and to act as the legislative
power in the meantime. The Constituent Assembly will also appoint a three-
man Junta (including a member of the opposition) which will act as the
executive power as from May 1, 1972. Presidential and Congressional elections
are scheduled for September 1974, and the new President and Congress are to
take office in December 1974. I am satisfied that the Government has
authority to guarantee a loan in present circumstances.



- 10 -
35.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Empresa, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua and the Bank,
the Report of the Cammittee provided for in Article III, Section L (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for water
supply projects. Of special interest are the provisions concerning
(i) environmental and water quality protection (Section 4.02, Loan Agree-
ment and Section 3.03, Guarantee Agreement); and (ii) preference for
Central American suppliers (Schedule L, paragraph 3, Loan Agreement).
36.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would camply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
37.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
