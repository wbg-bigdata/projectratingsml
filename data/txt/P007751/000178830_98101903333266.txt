APPRAISAL OF
SECOND MANAGUA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
NICALAGUA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a second water supply proja.ct
to be undertaken by the Empresa Aguadora de Managua, an autonomous entity
of the Nicaraguan Government which supplies water to Managua, the capital
of Nicaragua. The Project is the second stage of a long-term program,
started in 1963, to expand the Empresa's water supply system. A Bank loan
of US$6.9 million equivalent is proposed. The Empresa was the beneficiary
of Credit 26-NI for US$3 million, which helped finance the US$6 million
first stage (1963-66) of this program. That stage was complated on sched-
ule and within the cost estimate, and the Empresa's overall performance
under the credit was satisfactory.
ii.       Spurred by a population growth rate of 6%, which is almost double
that of the country as a whole, Managua's water requirements are ranidly
reaching the capacity of the present system. The quality of service will
soon deteriorate unless the system is expanded. The Project cortaists of
the least cost facilities required to meet the city's needs for water over
the next decade.
iii.      The Project would open a new well field east of the city; increase
booster pumping capacity at the present two sources of water for the system;
expand transmission, distribution and storage capacity; and replace the ad-
ministration building, which is inadequate, with a new one. Construction
and engineering work is estimated to cost US$10 million (C$70 million) and
interest during construction US$0.9 million (C$6.0 million). The proposed
loan would cover the full foreign exchange cost, or 69%, of construction
and engineering work. The balance of the funds required would come from
the Empresa's internal cash generation.
iv.       All Project components would be subject to international com-
petitive bidding.  All the civil works contracts are expected to be won by
Nicaraguan firms and all equipment supply contracts by foreign firms.
V.        The Empresa would be the Borrower.  Acquired by the Government in
1932, it is a well-managed public enterp*ise under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Public Works. It generates its own funds, prepares its budget
and owns its assets.
vi.       The Empresa's financial position is expected to remain sound
during and after the Project. Even at their ebb, in 1975, cash assets



- ii -
would exceed C$7 million (US$1 million), and the rate of return would
be about 5%.
vii.      The internal financial rate of return on the Project would be
about 11%.
viii.     With the Agreements reached during negotiations noted in Section
VIII, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan to the E-presa, guaranteed by
the Republic of Nicaragua of US$6.9 million equivalent for a term of 24 years,
including a 3-1/2 year grace period.



APPRAISAL OF
SECOND MANAGUA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
NICARAGUA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Nicaragua has requested a Bank loan to help
finance the second stage of the expansion program of the Empresa Aguadora
de Managua, an autonomous governmental entity responsible for 3upplying
water to Managua, the capital and premier city of Nicaragua. A Bank
loan of US$6.9 million to the Empresa, and guaranteed by the Republic of
Nicaragua, is proposed.
1.02      This would be the second Bank group project with the Empresa.
IDA Credit 26-NI of 1963 for US$3 million (C$21 million), re-lent by the
Government to the Empresa with repayment over 20 years at 6% interest,
helped finance the US$6 million (C$41 million) first-stage water supply
project (Appraisal Report No. TO-333). That project, completed success-
fully in 1966, enabled the Empresa to double the number of people it
served. Most of the institutional and financial objectives sought by
IDA, particularly improvement of the financial condition through a tariff
increase, were attained. The IDA Credit was supplemented by a capital con-
tribution of C$9 million from the Government, and in 1966, the Government
made a further loan of C$5.6 million for extension of the distribution
system and for service reservoirs.
1.03      The Project would open a new well field, increase pumping capac-
ity at the Empresa's existing sources of water supply, expand transmission,
distribution and storage capacity, and construct a new administration build-
ing. Its cost is estimated at C$70 million (US$10 million). All of the
foreign exchange requirements, amounting to C$48.3 million (US$6.9 million),
would be covered by the proposed loan. Interest during construction on the
proposed loan, and the balance of other funds required for the Project, would
be financed by the Empresa out of revenues.
1.04      The Project was planned by Hazen and Sawyer, the U.S. consulting
firm that designed the first-stage project, in joint venture with J. Agustin
Chan of Managua. This appraisal is based on the consultants' feasibility
study and on the findings of a Bank mission composed of Messrs. A. Bruestle
and R. Costa, who visited Nicaragua in Felruary and K.Iy 1971.

II. THE ECONOMY
2.01      Nicaragua, with an area of about 130,000 km2, is the largest
of the Central American countries. Its population of two million is grow-
ing at 3.6% a year and is shifting from rural to urban areas; 45% of the
people now live in towns and cities, compared with 36% in 1950. The focal
point of this population movement is Managua, whose annual growth rate is
6%.  Managua now has 390,000 inhabitants -- six times more than the next
largest city, Leon. Adequate land, labor and public services, and good
highway, rail and air transport facilities in Managua provide a suitable
environment for continued expansion of its commerce and industry as well
as its population.
2.02      Nicaragua's average income per capita is US$400 equivalent a year,
but income distribution is very uneven. Economic growth and investment in
the public sector are affected by the fluctuating market for the country's
main exports -- cotton and coffee. In the past little attention was given
by government to public investment planning, however a plan for 1972-76 is
now under preparation. Its primary objective is to diversify the economy
by encouraging the development of new activities which have good export
potentials. Public investment at a rate of 6% to 7% of GDP is planned,
compared with 4% in the late 1960s.
III. THE SECTOR
General
3.01      The Pan-American Health Organization reported that about 87% of
Nicaragua's urban and 6% of its rural population were served by piped water
at the end of 1969; of the urban population, 43% had house connections for
water and 32% were served by sewerage. Two of the Alliance for Progress
goals, as set out in the 1961 Charter of Punta del Este, are to provide
potable water supply and sewage disposal for at least 70% of the urban
population in Latin America; thus Nicaragua has succeeded in meeting the
goal for water supply but not for sewerage (see Annex 1 for a regional
comparison).
3.02      The principal entities in the sector are the Empresa Aguadora de
Managua, the capital city's main supplier of potable water; the Departamento
Nacional de Acueducto y Alcantarillado (DENACAL), a national agency operating
water and sewerage systems throughout the country and the sewerage system in
Managua; and various municipal governments. Three ministries have authority
over these entities (see Annex 2): the Ministry of Public Works, with de lure
authority over the Empresa; the Ministry of Health, which administers DENACAL;
and the Ministry of the Interior, which has administrative authority over



-3-
municipalities. The Empresa, with its financial and administrative independ-
ence and high quality performance, is the exemplary institution in the sector.
DENACAL plans and runs its system moderately well, and has received Inter-
American Development Bank financial support for some of its programs. The
water supply systems operated by municipal governments, however, are gener-
ally poor, and are particularly deficient in the financial aspects of their
operations.
*            3.03      The prospects for continued progress in the water supply and
sewerage sector in Nicaragua, under the leadership of the Empresa and
DENACAL, are good. The sector has a sound institutional base, modern
utility practices are understood and generally implemented, and manage-
rial and technical talent is available. DENACAL plans to press &iead with
further programs to acquire and operate the weak municipal 3ystems not now
under its control.
The Empresa
3.04      As the main supplier of water to Managua, the Empresa serves about
280,000 (72%) of the city's population with its fully metered system (34,000
connections) and provides water to 43 concessionaire-opzratzd community
standpipes serving an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people. Independent systems
of governmental and private entities serve another 20,000 to 30,000 people
with house connections and the balance of the population (about 80,000 peo-
ple) with private wells and community standpipes. Large industrial users in
Managua generally have their own groundwater sources.
3.05      The Empresa's last major expansion (financed by Credit 26-NI) was
in 1963-66, when it increased its installations for pumping, transmission
and distribution and more than doubled the quantity of water it could de-
liver. As a result of this expansion and subsequent routine works, the
number of people the Empresa served increased by 115% (about 150,000), and
the percentage of Managua's population served increased from 52% in 1963
to the present 72%. The Empresa now produces 20 Mgd on average and 23 Mgd
at peak.
3.06      About 95% of the Empresa's water comes from Laguna Asososca, a
volcanic crater at the western edge of the city, and the remaining 5% from
a well at Altamira on the Masaya highway just south of the city. The lake,
which is fed mainly by underground water, has an estimated long-term
dependable yield of 20 Mgd. Its water is chemically and bacteriologically
excellent, and chlorination is the only treatment needed and provided. It
is necessary, however, to take measures to protect the water against possi-
ble contamination; this is discussed in paragraph 3.1C. The Altamira well
yields 0.5 Mgd of high-quality water and is the first of a series of wells
to be installed at that site; a second well is under construction.
3.07      Water is drawn from Laguna Asososca by a pumping station in the
crater, which supplies water to the low-service zone and to two high-
service pumping stations on the crater's rim. The extent of the service



zones is established by topography. The low-service zone serves the down-
town and industrial areas, while the other zones supply primarily residen-
tial areas. The total storage capacity of the distribution system is 11
Mgal; peak demand is met by this storage and by pumping from Laguna Asososca.
There are eight booster pumping stations at various points in the system
to serve outlying and high areas.
3.08      Operation of the Empresa's water system is good.  Pressure is
continuously adequate, water quality good and systematically monitored,
chlorine residual maintained, and equipment adequately though not routinely
maintained. Water unaccounted for has decreased from 42% in 1963 to 19%,
which is a reasonable level. The Empresa recently started a preventive
maintenance program for meters and will expand it to take care of other
equipment.
3.09      The community standpipes that are supplied with the Empresa's
water serve about 2% of Managua's population in illegally-settled areas
and other sections of Managua where the residents, usually for economic
reasons, do not connect to the water system. The standpipes, which serve
about 200 capita each, are the property of 34 concessionaires, and are
usually located adjacent to the concessionaire's domicile. The conces-
sionaire purchases water from the Empresa at C$2.00 per 1,000 gallons and
sells it for C$5.00. The Empresa has found that this arrangement is cheaper
and administratively better than if it were to operate the standpipes itself.
Although the standpipe consumer pays a higher price per unit of water than
the connected customer, his total monthly payments are lower because he con-
sumes less and avoids the minimum and connection charges. At the time of ap-
praisal the sanitary quality of the standpipes was found to be poor and the
water dispensed from them subject to contamination. The Empresa advised the
Bank that it would upgrade the standpipes in accordance with a standard de-
sign which would reduce the chances of contamination.
3.10      Some industries between Laguna Asososca and Lake Managua discharge
their wastes, after partial treatment, into ditches that flow into Lake Ma-
nagua; these discharges seep into the soil en route and under certain con-
ditions could contaminate Laguna Asososca. The consultants have recommended
that a sewer be built to carry the discharges to Lake Managua, which could
receive them without adverse effect.  The Government and the Empresa agreed
during negotiations that the consultants' recommendations, or some other
suitable action to safeguard Laguna AsososCa from contamination, would be
implemented and made effective by March 31, 1972 or such other date as
may be agreed with the Bank.
3.11      The quality of the Empresa's water sources could also be compro-
mised by the infiltration of brackish water from Lake Managua if the water
table were excessively lowered. Systematic monitoring from observation
wells between Lake Managua and the Empresa' s sources of groundwater would
give forewarning of any over-pumping, and the Empresa agreed during nego-
tiations to adopt a satisfactory groundwater monitoring program.



-5-
Independent Systems
3.12      About 6% of Managua's population is served by independent water
systems owned and operated by private and civil entities, DENACAL and the
Government Housing Bank. All of these systems have groundwater supplies
which vary from good to poor quality: the physical facilities likewise
vary widely in quality. Tariffs are generally lower than those of the
Empresa because they are designed to cover operating expenses only. As
its own system expands the Empresa will acquire these systems and serve
them with its water. Acquisition would be without cost to the Empresa in
accordance with established practice. All but two of the system's water
sources would be abandoned, for reason of efficiency of operations. The
Empresa does not expect difficulty in raising tariffs to its own levels
since the quality of service would be improved.
DENACAL
3.13      DENACAL is responsible for supplying water and aewerage to urban
and rural communities containing about half of the country's population;
it does this through local semi-autonomous entities that it owns and oper-
ates. Its water systems serve 120 communities with & population totaling
half a million; there are 33,000 connections, 65% of them metered. DENACAL
also administers Managua's sewerage, which serves 250,000 people, or 65% of
the city's population. Sewers are mainly in the central part of the city,
and discharge untreated wastes by gravity into Lake Managua via many short
outfalls. Where there are no sewers, septic tanks or natural land drainage
serve in their place.
3.14      DENACAL has 30 engineers and 420 other employees, a reasonable
number considering its wide-spread operation. Improvements recommended
in a management study, sponsored by the Pan-American Health Organization,
have recently been introduced by DENACAL with good results; the organiza-
tion has been restructured and some management systems have been computer-
ized. DENACAL's financial position is fairly good; at the end of 1970,
its total fixed assets were valued at C$65 million, its cash holdings were
C$0.7 million, and its current ratio was 2.4. DENACAL's tariffs vary by
community, and are generally set to cover operating expenses and debt obli-
gations or depreciation.
3.15      DENACAL has just completed a major program (for rural water sup-
plies) and has two in progress, each financed in part by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB):
(i) a C$23 million rural water supply improvement project for
79 small communities with populations of 300 to 3,000;
(ii) a C$95 million country-wide water supply and sewerage
project for 64 communities and 10 cities, to supply
piped water to an additional 350,000 people, which is
programmed for 1972-76; and



- 6 -
(iii)  a C$55 million expansion of Managua's sewerage system,
started in early 1972, to relieve insanitary conditions
in residential areas; the project includes collectors,
interceptors, three pumping stations and sewerage treat-
ment. The mode of treatment is under study; a previous
study concluded that a 1,000-meter outfall in Lake Mana-
gua could discharge screened sewage without adverse ef-
fects. The sewerage system proposed is in balance with
the existing and proposed water system, and is scheduled
to be substantially completed by end 1974.
_Mnicipal Supplies
3.16      Approximately a third of Nicaragua's two million people live in
municipalities which are responsible, under the authority of the Ministry
of Interior, for their own water supply. The important cities of Granada,
Jinotega, Esteli and Rivas have such supplies. The services provided by
the municipalities are generally poor and there is need to improve and
expand them. The Government has expectations that DENACAL will take over
and improve them in the future, but there is no program to do so other
than the second project mentioned in paragraph 3.15.
IV. THE PROJECT
Managua's Water Supply Program
4.01      The Project is the second stage of a lona-range program, started
in 1963, to augment and improve the Empresa's water supply system. It would
be carried out during 1972-74, and have the purpose of (a) increasing the
quantity of water available from an average of 21 Mgd to 35 Mgd, (b) approx-
imately doubling the capacity of the transmission network and improving its
operational characteristics by installing additional pumping capacity and
service reservoirs, and (c) expanding the distribution network by about 11%
to enlarge the area served. The additional water would come mainly from a
new well field at Las Mercedes to the east of Managua, where more wells
could be added in the late 1970s when the need arose. The third stage of
the long-range program - a new well field 27 km east of the city - is plan-
ned for the early 1980s. Annex 3 is a graph showing the Empresa's output
and sales of water, past and forecast.
4.02      Managua's groundwater potential was evaluated in 1964 under the
first-stage project. It was re-evaluated in 1970-71, employing pumping and
water-level data for Laguna Asososca collected since 1964, and data from well
tests conducted at Las Mercedes and Altamira. This latest study concluded
that well fields at Las Mercedes and Altamira could yield 26 and 5 Mgd, re-
spectively. It also concluded that Laguna Asososca could be depended upon to
yeild only 20 Mgd, instead of the 32 Mgd previously estimated; hence, Lake
Asososca is now almost fully exploited, and the 1964 schedule for using
other sources of groundwater has had to be advanced by several years.



-7-
Description of the Project
4.03      The Project would:
(i) Open a new 15 Mgd well field at Las Mercedes, about 7 km
east of the city's center; including the construction of
6 wells, and low and high-service booster pumping stations
of 28 Mgd and 12 Mgd capacity, respectively.
(ii)  Increase the capacity of the Laguna Asososca low service
pumping station from 40 to 48 Mgd.
(iii) Increase the capacities of the 10.5 Mgd high and the
4.0 Mgd upper-high booster pumping stations at Laguna
Asososca to 15.5 and 6.6 Mgd, respectively.
(iv)  Construct an additional well at the recently opened
Altamira well field (see paragraph 3.06), and a well
at the San Cristobal low service reservoirs.
(v) Construct 58 km of transmission main (12 to 36 in)
and 42 km of distribution pipelines (2 to 8 in).
(vi)  Construct two reinforced concrete service reservoirs
(each 0.5 M gal).
(vii) Install 9,400 service connections.
(viii) Construct a new administration building to replace the
present inadequate facilities.
(ix)  Purchase mobile construction equipment for use in routine
water system maintenance and expansion.
(x) Provide the services of engineering consultants for the
final design and construction supervision of the Project
and management consultants for the improvement of manage-
ment systems.
Annex 4 gives a detailed description of the Project and cost estimates.
4.04      All the water delivered has to be pumped to the three pressure
zones of the distribution system, known as the low-service, high-service
and upper-high-service zones. The high- end upper-high-service zone pump-
ing stations have been designed to meet the demands of peak days and would
operate at full design output with one pump on standby. Peak hourly demands
and fire flows would be met by drawing down the service reservoirs. Since
Laguna Asososca is a convenient reservoir for short-term demands as well as
a source of water, the low-service pumping station which draws water from
the lake is designed for maximum hourly demand plus fire flows, and has



- 8 -
two standby pumps. Chlorination, the only treatment required, would be

4.06      These estimates are generally based on supplier's quotations and
unit costs of recent similar work in Managua, and are at 1971 price levels.
The costs of consulting services are based upon actual proposals. Physical
contingencies of 15% on directly imported equipment, and 20% on civil works,
adequately reflect the degrees of uncertainty associated with the physical
aspects of the Project. An annual local and foreign price contingency of
5% has been allowed through the period of construction for possible price
increases. The effects of recent changes in the values of foreign curren-
cies are adequately reflected in the estimates. The estimates do not in-
clude a 5% sales tax since the Government has agreed to continue to re-
imburse the Empresa the full amount of this tax.
4.07      The cost of the administration building is a preliminary estimate.
The plans and estimates for the building are in preparation.



-9-
Amount of Proposed Loan
4.08      A loan for US$6.9 million, equal to 69% of the total Project cost
of US$10 million, is proposed in order to finance --
(i)  the full estimated foreign exchange cost of all civil
works and equipment supply contracts, including contin-
gencies, which amounts to US$6.4 million; and
(ii)  the estimated foreign exchange cost of consulting services
for engineering design and construction supervision, and
for management systems, which amounts to US$0.5 million.
4.09      Interest during construction on the loan, amounting to US$0.9
million equivalent, plus the total local expenditure of US$3.1 million
equivalent, would be financed by the Empresa out of earnings.
Procurement
4.10      All materials and services to be financed out of the proceeds of
the loan would be procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for in-
ternational competitive bidding. The Empresa must, however, give preference
(limited to 50% of existing import duties) to suppliers in Central American
countries in accordance with the Central American Agreement on Fiscal Incen-
tives for Industrial Development. In accordance with current Bank practice
suppliers from the Central American Common Mlarket, including those in Nica-
ragua, will be allowed a preference of either 15% of the CIF landed price,
or 50% of the import duties applying to suppliers from non-member countries,
whichever is lower. It is expected that all civil works contracts would be
won by Nicaraguan firms, and all the equipment supply contracts would be
won by foreign firms, including about US$200,000 for small diameter pipe (up
to 8 in.) by suppliers in other central American Countries.
Disbursement
4.11      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of all
direct imports, the foreign exchange costs of the engineering and manage-
ment consultants, and 28% of the cost of civil works. If any Nicaraguan
suppliers win contracts, disbursements would be made on the basis of 95% of
the ex-factory price, representing the local price less identifiable taxes.
The estimated disbursement schedule is in Annex 6.
4.12      The engineering consultants have begun work on final designs and
management consultants have been engaged to help solve the problems identi-
fied during appraisal (see paragraph 6.03). It is therefore proposed that
expenditures for consultants incurred after September 1, 1971 of up to
US$150,000 would be reimbursed from the loan account.



- 10 -
Project Supervision
4.13      The Empresa has retained the consultants that prepared the feasibil-
ity report, Hazen and Sawyer (USA) in joint venture with J. Agustin Chan of
Managua, for design and construction supervision of the Project. These con-
sultants are acceptable to the Bank. Assurances have been obtained during
negotiations that consultants acceptable to the Bank would continue to be em-
ployed for the duration of the Project.
4.14      Three years of construction, 1972 through 1974, are expected.  The
schedule is shown in Annex 7.
V. JUSTIFICATION
Investment Objectives and Demand Forecast
5.01      The Project is essential to meet Managua's needs for water over
the next decade and is properly timed to prevent deterioration in the qual-
ity of service. Demand on the existing water supply facilities is rapidly
reaching their capacity; the 19 Mgd drawn from Lake Asososca is just 1 Mgd
short of its estimated long-term yield, some of the transmission mains are
already overtaxed and, in one section of the city, there is not sufficient
capacity to refill service reservoirs during the night. Without the Proj-
ect, the Empresa would either have to refuse to make new connections to its
supply or allow water pressures to fall and, by 1974, begin to interrupt
the service -- which, because of possible seepage of contaminated ground-
water into the distribution pipes, could threaten the potability of the sup-
ply. Moreover, the present level of fire protection would be impaired.
5.02      Demand for water in Managua is expected to continue to grow, as
in the past, at about 8% per year. The present sales of 16 Mgd in 1971
would thus increase to 20 Mgd by 1974, the year the Project would be com-
pleted, and to about 40 Mgd by 1983, the year production from the next
major water-source development would be required. In forecasting demand,
account was taken not only of population growth but also of the Empresa's
expected expansion into new areas, acquisition of independent systems, and
a modest increase in per capita production, which, at about 70 gallons, is
in the same range as other cities in Latin America to whom the Bank has
made loans. The percentage of water unaccounted for is expected to remain
comparatively low (19%) and no additional large industrial or commercial
consumers are envisioned. The demand projections are on the low side of
a possible range; should demand increase more rapidly than projected, the
Empresa would react by advancing the construction date of the additional
wells at Altamira, San Cristobal and Las Mercedes. Annex 8 shows the pop-
ulation served by the water supply system and the city's total population
from 1963 to 1980.



- 11 -
Least-Cost Solution
5.03       The Project is the least-cost method, at all positive discount
rates, of increasing the Empresa's water supply because it exploits high-
quality groundwater close to the point of use, and permits expansion in
small increments as need arises. The costlier alternative sources of sup-
ply are groundwater farther to the east of the city (requiring longer pipe-
lines), Lake Managua (requiring substantial treatment), or Lake Nicaragua
(requiring moderate treatment but a long transmission line).
Internal Financial Rate of Return
5.04       The internal financial rate of return on the Project is about
11%. The calculation is shown in Annex 9. The return would fall to about
10% with a 10% increase in the cost of the Project, or to 9% with a 10%
decrease in expected demand. Benefits in the calculation of the internal
financial rate of return are measured by the revenue expected from the
additional quantity of water provided by the Project, after deducting in-
cremental operating costs (net of depreciation) of the Project. This
internal financial rate of return understates the economic return on the
Project, because benefits to public health and better fire protection are
not fully reflected in the price charged for water.
Environmental Aspects
5.05       By ensuring that Managua will not be short of potable water in
the future, the Project would help promote a sanitary environment for the
city's residents and would also provide water essential to the success of
the Government's housing program. The Project would have no long-term ad-
verse effects on the environment. Additional sewage would be produced as
a result of the Project; however, DENACAL's expansion of the sewerage sys-
tem (see paragraph 3.15 (iii)) would provide for satisfactory removal and
disposal of the sewage.
VI. THE BORROWER
Organization
6.01       Empresa Aguadora de Managua, the proposed borrower, has been a
Government-owned utility since 1932. Although administratively attached
to the Ministry of Public Works, the Empresa operates independently and
reports directly to the President of the Republic. It owns its assets,
prepares its budget and generates its own funds. Its present by-laws
(Reglamento) were enacted in June 29, 1963, in conjunction with Credit
26-NI. In part due to the conditions of the Credit, the Empresa's finan-
cial position is sound, and it is generally well managed, having carried
out successfully its last major expansion (1963-1966) which the Credit
helped to finance. Organization of the Empresa is shown in Annex 10.



- 12 -
6.02      The Government and the Empresa are revising the Reglamento to
make it consistent with proposed management and financial changes, and
to broaden the Empresa's legal authority over its water sources. Enact-
ment of the new Reglamento is a condition of loan effectiveness. The Gov-
ernment and the Empresa agreed during negotiations that they will consult
with the Bank prior to making significant future changes in the Reglamento.
6.03      Despite the overall quality of the Empresa's organization and
operations, some problems concerning personnel and management systems were
identified during appraisal. The Empresa has since taken significant
measures, including the employment of management consultants, to solve
these problems. The problems, and the Empresa's response to them, are
discussed below.
Staff
6.04      The present general manager, who joined the Empresa in 1960, has
performed well over the past decade. However, the vacancy since 1968 of
the deputy general manager's position has jeopardized prospects for contin-
ued good management. Following discussions during appraisal, the Empresa
appointed in October 1971, with the Bank Group's concurrence, a new and
qualified deputy general manager. The Government and the Empresa agreed
during negotiations that they will consult with the Bank prior to appoint-
ing a new general or deputy general manager.
6.05      In the past the Empresa has relied exclusively on consultants to
plan future development. In order to improve its in-house capability, the
Empresa has created a planning committee composed of the deputy general
manager and the technical, financial and data processing managers, with
responsibility for the budget, technical and financial studies, and the
long-range planning of system expansions. For the duration of the Project
an engineer would be assigned responsibility to coordinate inter-departmental
and consultants' activities related to the Project. The Empresa would also
employ, prior to the start of major construction, additional engineers to
assist in supervision of construction of the Project, and later to operate
and maintain the completed works.
6.06      The Empresa has a staff of 370, or 1.3 employees per thousand
people served. This ratio is somewhat high, but is expected to improve
in the course of future expansion. In common with government employees
in Nicaragua, the employees do not belong to a union, and have never been
on strike. Wages have not been increased since 1967. Fringe benefits
include health and life insurance and, although not covered by formal
regulation, a pension equivalent to half salary to those who retire at 65
years of age. To help assure equitable and competitive compensation for
its employees, the Empresa's management consultants will review its salary,
wage and fringe benefit policies.



- 13 -
Billing and Collecting
6.07      Billing and collection is satisfactory.  Bills are processed by
the Empresa's computer and distributed monthly. Bills include charges fcc
sewerage, which the Empresa collects on behalf of DENACAL on a commission
basis. There is a strict policy of disconnecting for non-payment, so less
than 1% of the bills to private customers and 11% to government customers
remain outstanding longer than six monthst.
6.08      Collections were formerly made entirely by house-to-house col-
lectors. The system is costly: the collectors retain 6% of the amount
collected. In 1968 the Empresa introduced a cheaper system whereby bills
are mailed and paid at local banks or the Empresa's central office, and
about 55% of the bills are now rendered and collected in this manner. The
Empresa is expanding the system to cover all consumers who can be reached
by the postal service.
Accounting and Inventories
6.09      The present accounting system, which was introduced in 1966 fol-
lowing the recommendations of a study by the Pan-American Health Organiza-
tion in 1965, is generally satisfactory. There is, however, room for im-
provement of budgetary control systems, and cost-accounting and inventory con-
trol operations; part of these operations could be effectively done by the
computer, which is. presently under-utilized. Inventory management also
needs improvement; the inventory level on December 30, 1970 was an exces-
sive C$3.5 million, or 2.7 times the annual consumption of materials. The
Empresa's management consultants will study these aspects of the Empresa's
operations (see paragraph 6.12).
Auditing
6.10      Commercial auditing, initiated under the terms of Credit 26-NI,
has been satisfactory since 1964 and is now done by the local office of
Peat, Marwick and Mitchell (USA). In order to ensure continued satisfac-
tory auditing, the Empresa has agreed during negotiations to extend to
the proposed loan the Credit 26-NI covenant that requires an annual audit
by qualified independent accountants satisfactory to the Bank.
6.11      An auditor of the national government, whose purpose is to
standardize the Empresa' s accounting reports to the government, is resident
at the Empresa. This auditor, however, does not review nor recommend on
the Empresa's internal policies, procedures and controls. The Empresa
agreed during negotiations to have the management consultants (see paragraph
6.12) study the need for an internal audit position to perform these tasks.
Management Consultants
6.12      Following discussions during appraisal, the Empresa engaged as
Consultants the Pan-American Health Organization to undertake a review of



- 14 -
various management operations. The consultants, who have already made a
diagnostic visit to the Empresa, would devote particular attention to
salaries and wages, budgetary control, accounting, inventory management
and control, computer utilization and the need for an internal audit.
During negotiations the Empresa agreed to review the consultants' find-
ings with the Bank, and to establish by September 30, 1972, a mutually
acceptable program of management improvements based upon the consultants'
recommendations.
VII. FINANCES
7.01      The Empresa's financial position is sound and has been improving
since completion of the first-stage project in 1966. Its past financial
statements for selected years are summarized below and are detailed in
Annexes 11-14 for 1968-1970.

Financing Plan
7.02      The financing plan for 1972-1975 is summarized below.  The plan
takes into account a tariff increase of 10% in 1974. The Bank loan is
assumed to have a term of 24 years including 3-1/2 years of grace, and
to carry interest at 7-1/4%. Detailed financial tables are in Annexes
11-13; Annex 15 describes the assumptions used in the financial projections.

Total Sources                 82.7      11.8     100.0
7.03      In April 1971 the Empresa requested a C$2.6 million loan from the
Government to help finance the Project. Since this borrowing is not re-
quired by the financing plan, it is expected that the Empresa would with-
draw its request.
Tariffs
7.04      Tariffs in 1970 averaged C$2.43 (US$0.35) per 1,000 gallons, an
appropriate level for a water supply system of Managua's size and type.
The last water tariff increase, 50% on average, was in 1963. The increase
caused adverse public reaction which was aggravated by poor billing and
collection procedures. The Empresa has been able to keep water tariffs
constant since 1963, through economies of scale and stringent cost control;
however, costs are rising and tariff increases will be required in a few
years if the financial viability of the Empresa is to be preserved. The
present water tariffs are given in Annex 16.
7.05      The structure of water tariffs is generally reasonable.  Except-
ing public standpipes, the allotments (5,000-25,000 gallons depending upon
the type of consumer) under the mimimum monthly charges are consistant with
conventional practice and sufficiently small to discourage gross waste.
During negotiations the Empresa agreed to reduce the minimum monthly allot-
ment and charge for public standpipes from C$50.00 and 25,000 gallons to
C$20.00 and 10,000 gallons, respectively, because average standpipe consump-
tion is about 14,000 gallons per month. The unit price of water is essen-
tially uniform, except that residential consumers are charged a preferential



- 16 -
price if they consume between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons and a penalty price
for more than that amount. Outlying areas of the city that are served by
multiple pumping stations also have higher tariffs to reflect the higher
cost of service.
7.06      Credit Agreement 26-NI (Section 4.06) and its Subsidiary Loan
Agreement (Section 5.06) stipulate that the Government and the Empresa
shall maintain tariffs adequate to provide sufficient revenue to cover
operating expenses including taxes (if any), depreciation or debt service,
routine extensions and a part of future major expansions. It was agreed
at the time (Supplementary Letter dated September 7, 1962) that these ob-
jectives would be achieved by means of an average tariff of about C$2.50
per 1,000 gallons. The operating ratio, with a year-by-year schedule of
steadily declining target ratios terminating in 1971 at 50%, was also es-
tablished as the test of financial performance. There have been recent
shortfalls in the average tariff and operating ratio norms, but they have
not been of sufficient magnitude to appreciably affect the Empresa's finan-
cial position.

1969       2.50             2.47               53              53
1970       2.50             2.43               51              53
7.07      Since the rate of return is a more comprehensive measure of finan-
cial performance, the Empresa agreed during negotiations to replace the oper-
ating ratio criterion with a conventional rate of return criterion. The nu-
merator of this rate of return calculation would be gross revenues less oper-
ating expenses, depreciation and taxes (if any); and the denominator, average
net fixed assets in service, realistically valued. In order to continue its
satisfactory financial performance, the Empresa has agreed to set tariffs
at a level to maintain its rate of return in the long-run of at least 7%,Z,
except in the years 1974-77, when it will be not less than 5% to allow for
the short-run distortion caused by the sudden jump in the rate base. An
increase of about 10% in the average tariff, to C$2.75 (US$0.39) per 1,000
gallons, may be necessary by 1975 to achieve these rates of return.
Future Finances
7.08      The Empresa's forecasted income statements are summarized below.
Detailed forecasted financial statements are in Annexes 11-14.

7.09      The debt service ratio would drop to 2.0 when loan amortization
begins and recover to 2.6 by 1978.  The Subsidiary Loan Agreement correspond-
ing to Credit 26-NI stipulates that the Empresa shall not incur any long-term
debt unless its net revenue for any 12 consecutive months in the 15-month
period before the date of such incurrence is not less than 1.5 times the
maximum debt service requirements on all debt (including the debt newly in-
curred) in the succeeding fiscal year. This covenant will be repeated for
the proposed loan.
7.10      The financial performance of the Empresa should continue to be
good after completion of the Project in 1974. The expected minimum cur-
rent ratio (2.0), maximum operating ratio (50%), cash reserves, and rate
of return would all be satisfactory. The percentage of long-term debt
to capitalization would decrease from a maximum of 47% in 1973 to 33% in
1978. If tariffs were not increased by 1975 the financial condition of
the Empresa would be weakened, particularly in the three-year period fol-
lowing Project completion. The cash reserve during that period would drop
to about C$2 million, which is somewhat less than the minimum required for
meeting debt service payments and payrolls. The financial rate of return
would be about 4%, and the operating ratio would exceed 50%.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  measures would be adopted to safeguard the Empresa's
water sources against contamination (paragraphs 3.10
and 3.11);



- 18 -
(b) the Empresa's Reglamento would be amended, prior to ef-
fectiveness of the loan, to permit proposed organizational
changes (paragraph 6.02);
(c) tariffs would be maintained at a level adequate to earn
a 7% rate of return except in 1974 through 1977 when 5%
would be satisfactory (paragraph 7.07);
(d)  a program of management improvements based upon the
consultants recommendations would be adopted (para-
graph 6.12).
8.02      On the basis of the agreements reached the Project is suitable
for a US$6.9 million Bank loan (including US$0.15 million retroactive
financing) to the Empresa and guaranteed by the Republic of Nicaragua, for
a term of 24 years, including a 3-1/2 year grace period.

MANAGUA SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
EMPRESA AGUADORA DE MANAGUA
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This annex briefly describes the Project, explains some principal
considerations in its design, and concludes with a list of the Project's
components and their costs.
Reference to the map will give a good idea of the physical
characteristics and extent of the existing system, and the relationship
of the Project to it. Note that the distribution network is divided into
three zones which operate at different pressures. These zones have been
designated in this report by the names which the Empresa itself uses, to
avoid any possibility of confusion with other documentation. Thus the
area including the inner city which is at the lowest level, is the low-
service zone; the next level is the high-service zone; and the highest
ground to the south is the upper-high service zone.
Laguna Asososca
Laguna Asososca is the main source of supply at present, and has
a reliable long-term yield of 20 Mgd. The lake is replenished mainly by
underground water. Water is drawn from the lake by a pumping station
that feeds the low-service zone and the booster pumping stations of the
high and upper-high service zones.
One new 8 Mgd pump would be added to the present five to bring
the installed capacity of the low-service pump station at Laguna Asososca
to 48 Mgd. The starters for the pumps would be relocated to the present
operator's room, and a new operator's room would be constructed in an
old pump house on shore.
One new 5 Mgd pump would be added to the three existing 3.5 Mgd
pumps of the high-service pumping station to increase the firm (net of
standby) capacity of the station to 12 Mgd. Similarly, one new 2.6 Mgd
pump would be added to the two existing 2 Mgd pumps of the upper-high-
service pumping station. All pumps are to be housed iul the same building,
at the rim of the Laguna Asososca crater, constructed in 1963-66 under the
first-stage project. Additional transformer capacity would also be pro-
vided.



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 6 pages
Altanira
The Altamira well field is estimated to have a potential yield of
about 5 Mgd. The first well was installed in 1971 and a second is now under
construction. Under the Project one or two additional wells would be con-
structed, depending upon the yields of the first two wells. The wells would
discharge to the existing Altamira storage tanks through a 20-inch header.
Flow would be measured and chlorinated ahead of the tanks.
The existing Altamira upper-high-service pumping station takes
water from the Altamira storage tanks and delivers it to the service area
along the Masaya highway. The two existing pumps are rated at 1.4 Mgd
each. A third pump of 2.6 Mgd would be installed in the existing building,
which would also house chlorination equipment and the controls for the well
pumps.
San Cristobal
One well would be constructed at the site of the San Cristobal
low service storage reservoirs. The well pump would feed water directly
to the reservoirs. The in-place cost of the well is estimated to be rela-
tively low, and the construction period short, because of the close prox-
imity of the well to the reservoirs. The short construction period is
relevant because projections indicate that a slight water deficit may
occur in 1973 or 1974.
Las Mercedes
An extensive groundwater testing program undertaken in prepara-
tion for the Project indicates that about 26 Mgd of good quality groundwater
can be obtained by the construction of a well field southwest of Las Mercedes
International Airport. The wells would be located on a east-west line to
intercept the area's groundwater flow.   Six wells approximately 600 feet
deep and 14 or 16 inches in diameter, each with an expected yield of 2.5
Mgd, would be constructed under the Project. An additional 5 wells would
be constructed, as required by the demand, in the period 1976 to 1981. The
number of wells proposed initially would allow the Las Mercedes well field
to meet peak day demand with one well as standby; and after post-Project
expansion, with two wells as standby. The wells would discharge into a
header varying in diameter from 24 inches to 36 inches. Each well would be
equipped with a surface-mounted electric-motor drive, a check valve, a gate
valve for regulating the discharge, a meter and flow indicator, and a water
level measurement device.
The proposed Las Mercedes low-service pumping station, to be
located at the western end of the well field discharge header, would boost
the well water to the low-service zone pressure. It would be equipped with
four horizontal centrifugal pumps of 7 Mgd capacity each, which would meet
maximum daily demand with one pump as standby. There would also be chlorina-
tion facilities to chlorinate the well water before transmission to rManagua.



ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 6 pages
Dual chlorination equipment would insure that chlorination was continuous,
even in case of equipment failure. Flow metering would automatically regu-
late chlorination and record the volume of water transmitted to the city.
The station would also be provided with surge relief equipment and with
electrical controls to permit starting and stopping of the well pumps.
The proposed Las Mercedes high-service pumping station, to be
located to the west of the low-service pumping station, would boost low-
service-zone water with four 3 Mgd electric-motor-driven pumps, giving a
firm (net of standby) capacity of 9 Mgd which would be adequate until 1980.
The station would be provided with metering equipment.
Distribution Storage
All pumping stations, except the Laguna Asososca low-service pump-
ing station, would be designed to meet maximum daily water demand; the
latter would be designed to meet peak hourly demand. Demand greater than
the maximum pumping capacity would be met from the storage tanks. The
tanks would also provide flexibility of operation and emergency supply
capacity in the event of disruption in the pumping or supply facilities.
No emergency power generators would be provided since electrical power is
dependable and the emergency water supply capacity could cope with expected
outages.
The expected maximum hourly demand is 1.7 times the maximum daily
demand.  The maximum daily demand varies by zone and is 1.1r 1.3 and 1.6
times the average daily demand for the low, high and upper-high-service zones,
respectively. Design storage is approximately 24% of the maximua daily demand.
In addition to meeting the maximum hourly demand, the storage criterion in
the low-service zone includes capacity for fire flows of 5,000 gallons per
minute for a 5-hour duration. In the high-service zone, additional storage
for fire flows of 2,000 gallons per minute for 5-hour duration is provided.
Storage for the upper-high-service zone includes no allowance for fire flows
but rather an allowance for possible pipe break (5 hours at maximum daily
flow rate).
The storage presently available in the system's reservoirs and
the storage required to meet estimated maximum peak hourly demand in the
years 1980 and 1990 are shown in the table below.

Neither the low-service nor high-service zones require additional
storage before 1980. Additional peaking capacity required to meet the needs
of the low-service zone would be provided by pumping from Lake Asososca,
since the existing transmission mains have adequate carrying capacity. The
existing 5.0 M gal capacity of the high zone would suffice until about 1980.
The upper-high-service zone along the Masaya highway will require
1.0 M gal additional storage capacity to satisfy the needs of 1980. This
would be accomplished by the construction of two 0.5 M gal reinforced con-
crete tanks under the Project.
Transmission System
The total lengths of pipe 12 inches in diameter and larger to
be installed in the various service zones under the Project are shown in
the table below.

12                 30,000
Total       57,750
Distribution System
The distribution system in Managua consists mainly of 2, 4, 6 and
8 inch pipe network connected to the 12-inch to 30-inch transmission mains.
Normal year-to-year construction of distribution system mains is included
in the Project for the period 1972 through 1974. Additional distribution
facilities financed from operating revenues would be built after the Proj-
ect to utilize fully the supply and transmission capacities created by the
Project.



ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 6 pages
Service Connections
The Project includes 9,400 service connections to be installed dur-
ing the Project period.
Network Analyses
The adequacy of the proposed pumping, transmission and storage
system was tested by making a digital computer network analysis to deter-
mine the rate of flow in each principal main and the hydraulic gradient
under simulated conditions of peak hour, fire demand and tank filling in
the transmission system. A Hazen-Williams coefficient for pipe friction
of 120 was assumed in these studies for existing and proposed pipes.
This is considered appropriate because tests on wells and lake waters in-
dicate the water to be slightly encrustant. Neither source of water should
cause corrosion in the distribution system.
New Administration Building
The central office of the Empresa is now housed in an old building
that has been expanded piecemeal in an improvised manner. It has low ceilings
and poor ventilation and lighting. If customers line up in front of the serv-
ice window, many of them have to stand outside the building. The construc-
tion of a new central office building is proposed as it would not only enhance
employees' morale and efficiency, but would also enable the Empresa to imiprove
its customer service.
Mobile Equipment
Mobile equipment would consist of a crane, excavators, service
vehicles and miscellaneous small construction and maintenance equipment.
Project Timing
The Project is properly timed to prevent deterioration in service.
The distribution system and service connection components are required im-
mediately in order to meet connection requests of new customers. Elements
of the existing transmission system urgently need strengthening, as demon-
strated by the system's inability to refill the Altamira storage tanks even
at nighttime.
Production capability, the expansion of which has a two-year lead
time, must be promptly increased if the projected needs of 1974 are to be
met.

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3 pages
Assumptions made in Preparation of Cost and Disbursement Schedules
1.   Basic costs are as estimated by Hazen and Sawyer in
their feasibility report "Mas Agua Para Managua,"
dated 28 January, 1971.
2.   In order to express costs in 1971 prices, the Hazen
and Sawyer cost estimates, which are in 1970 prices,
were increased by 5X.
3.   The estimated cost of the building (C$2,750,000 net
of physical and price contingencies) is about 20%
higher than suggested by the Education Projects De-
partment architectural staff. Foreign and local
costs are proportioned at 45% and 55Z, per their
recommendation. The building's design would be re-
viewed with the Empresa to achieve cost reductions.
4.   "Local Costs" in the cost estimate are civil works
costs less Empresa-supplied imported materials and
the indirect foreign exchange component of civil
works contracts.
The indirect foreign exchange component of civil
works is assumed to be as follows:
Indirect Foreign Exchange
Item              as % of Total Item Cost    as % of Civil Works Cost
Wells and Well Pumps              12                          33
Pump Stations and Pumps            6                          21
Mains 12 in and larger             8                          27
2 in to 8 in               6                          13
Service Reservoirs                 6                           9
Service Connections                5                          14
Administration Building           45 /1
/1   The civil works contractor for the administration building is assumed
to furnish all materials, local and foreign.
In order to simplify the disbursement operation during
the course of the loan, the indirect foreign exchange
component is considered to be 28% of the civil works
contract, regardless of the item disbursed against.
The value of 28% is the weighted average of the item-
by-item percentages given in the above table. For this
reason, the total item-by-item disbursements shown in
the last column of the Annual Investment and Loan Dis-
bursement Schedule of this Annex do not necessarily
agree with the item-by-item foreign exchange costs
given in the cost estimate.



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 3 pages
5.   Contingencies are 20% and 15% of the cost of civil works
and items imported directly by the Empresa, respectively.
Contingency costs are assumed to be incurred six months
after the disbursement upon which they are calculated.
6.   The price contingency is calculated at the rate of 5%
per year, that is, 5% of the value of disbursements in
1972, 10% in 1973 and 16% in 1974.
7.   The contingencies were reduced by C$0.03 million to make
the loan amount an even US$6.9 million.
8.   Disbursements on 3% of the local and indirect foreign ex-
change costs are assumed deferred for one year after com-
pletion of the work, in accordance with the Empresa's
practice of retaining, for guarantee purposes, a portion
of payments due to civil works contractors.

NICARAGUA
MANAGUA SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
EMPRESA AGUADORA DE MANAGUA
INTERNAL FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
The internal financial rate of return is about 11%.
The internal financial return calculation considers as benefits
the incremental revenues earned as a result of the Project, and consi .ers
as costs the Project cost, its operating cost and the capitl and operating
cost of the additional works constructed after 1974 to fully utilize the
Project. The cost of making connections is approximately equal to the con-
nection fees, hence neither their cost nor their benefits enter the calcu-
lation. Operating costs are tEken net of depreciation.
The following adjustments to values in the financial statemtnts
are made in calculating the internal financial rate of return:
(i)  Since the present system will not operate ful1  capacity
until 1974, not all of the incremental water sales of 1972
and 1973 are credited to the Project. This adjustment is
made by estimating that even in the absence of the Project
80% of the incremental water sold in 1972, and 40% of the
incremental water sold in 1973 would be sold merely by mak-
ing connections and adding small diameter pipe to the di3-
tribution system. Beyond 1973 no incremental water would
be sold without the Project because the existing supply and
transmission systems would be operating at full capacity;
hence all of the 1974 and subsequent incremental sales are
attributed to the Project.
(ii)  Certain elements of Project costs are not charged to the
Project because it is assumed that they would have been
built even in the absence of the Project. For this adjust-
ment it is estimated that 40% of the distribution pipe
scheduled under the Project would have been installed in
the absence of the Project; the cost of this pipe is de-
ducted from the cost stream.
(iii)  All values in the cost and benefit streams a:e expressed
in the 1972 price level to achieve a common base for the
calculation. Benefits are based upon revenues earned at
1972 price levels, and no adjustment to benefits are ne-
cessary. Project costs are adjusted to 1972 price levels



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 3 pages
by adding 5% to the construction cost estimates ex-
pressed in 1971 prices. Operating costs are adjusted
by omitting the price level factor contained in the
formula for estimating operating costs.
The internal financial rate of return is probably less than the
internal economic return because the revenues from Project must understate
the total economic benefit to customers, and because it does not include
intangible benefits such as those due to improved public health conditions,
which even benefit those who do not purchase water.
The internal financial rate of return would fall to about 10%
with a 10% increase in the cost of the Project, and to 9% with a 10%
decrease in expected demand.
The cash flows used in the internal financial return calculation
are given in the following table.

INCOME STATEMENTS (see Annex 12)
Sales
The Empresa achieved a drop in unaccounted-for water from 42% in
1963 to 19% in 1969, as shown in the table below. This reduction is attrib-
uted to the new facilities constructed under the first-stage project (1963-66),
an increase in the percentage of metered connections from 75% in 1961 to 100%
in 1970, the replacement of old meters with new displacement meters, and an
effective leak control and maintenance program.

Rates have not been increased since 1963 and are shown in
Annex 16.
In a side letter dated September 7, 1962, to Credit Agreement the
Empresa agreed to maintain an average water sales price of C$2.50 per 1,000
gallons. This was accomplished in 1966 through 1968. The average water
sales price was C$2.47 in 1969 and C$2.43 in 1970.
Operating Ratio
The 1962 side letter to the Credit Agreement established a cri-
terion for operating ratio based on income after depreciation and exclud-
ing interest and connection fees. In a Bank letter dated June 1, 1967,



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 5 pages
the operating ratio was redefined to exclude depreciation. In the past
few years the Empresa's operating ratio was equal to or slightly higher
than the covenanted requirements, as shown below.

Depreciation
Assumed lives of assets are those recommended by the Ministry
of Public Works and have been used by the Empresa since 1963. No depre-
ciation was charged prior to June 30, 1960. The accumulated depreciation
at the end of 1970 represents 14% of Empresa's total gross fixed assets.
Annual depreciation, as a percentage of average gross fixed
assets in service during the year, averages 3.1%:

CASH FLOW STATEMENTS (see Annex 13)
Internal Cash Generation
Internal Cash Generation is broken down into Income before
Depreciation, Connection and Reconnection Fees, Non-operating Income,
and Adjustments to Earned Surplus.



ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 5 pages
Non-operating Income is the income realized mainly through the
sales of materials or scrapped and useless equipment.
Adjustments to Earned Surplus are deductions made to earnings
and concern non-operational circumstances or actions: such as the grant
made by the Empresa to the Government in 1970.
Increase in Capital
Increase in Capital represents the donations made to the Empresa
by individuals or urban developers. Normally, the Empresa takes over only
the mains and pipes which meet its standards. At the end of 1970 the total
donations amounted to C$3.3 million.
Customer Deposits
Each new customer has to make a cash deposit to the Empresa as a
guarantee of payment of his future bills. The deposits are calculated on
the basis of 1-1/2 months' average water consumption and are adjusted every
three months by the computer.

/1   Include maintenance, chemicals and materials used in distribution.
During the past few years the Empresa has performed very poorly
in the management and control of its inventories. This is shown by the
importance of year-to-year fluctuations in the level of inventories com-
pared with relatively constant consumption, and by the very high ratio of
inventories to yearly consumption.
Cash Position of the Empresa (see Annexes 12 and 14)
The cash position of the Empresa has been sound since 1963, with
notable improvement during the past four years. Total cash at the end of
1970 is C$5.6 million, of which C$4.0 million represents certificates in
the Central Bank.



ANNEX 14
Page 5 of 5 pages
The Empresa's ability to meet current obligations and its im-
mediate solvency have been more than comfortable in the past three years.
They are measured, respectively, by the current ratio which averages 2.8
and by the quick-ratio (current assets less inventories divided by current
liabilities) which averages 1.8.
BALANCE SHEET STATEMENTS (see Annex 12)
Gross Fixed Sheets
As of end of 1970 the total Gross Fixed Assets of the Empresa are
C$68 million, of which 15% represents the amount of gross fixed assets before
1962, 59% the amount of investments during the first-stage project (1963-66),
and the remaining 26% the amount of investments after completion of that
project.
Long-Term and Short-Term Receivables
Accounts receivable are net of provisions for bad debts. These
provisions average 60% for total long-term and 9% for total short-term
receivables.
Long-term receivables are essentially water billings overdue for
longer than one year by public entities.
Capital and Long-Term Loans
The first-stage project (1963-66) was financed in part by a loan
for C$21 million (US$3 million) the Government made to the Empresa through
IDA, repayable in 40 semiannual installments at 6% annual interest, and in
part by a C$9 million Government grant. In 1967 the Government made a
C$5.6 million loan to the Empresa at the same interest rate; payments will
be in 20 semiannual installments. Debt as percentage of total capital
investment has been less than 40% since 1968 and fell to 33% at the end
of 1970.
Accrued Interest
Accrued interest is the interest due each year on December 31
and has been related to the two Government loans. They represent 5-1/2
months of the total annual interest paid by the Empresa.

FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS
REVENUES
Revenues are from billings only. The average tariff, now at
C$2.47, is assumed to increase 10% to C$2.75 on January 1, 1974, and then
remain at that level.
Non-operating income remains constant.
COSTS
Labor
The cost of labor, based on 1970 figures, is projected to 1978
with the following assumptions:
- Administrative labor costs will increase 20% in 1971;
this represents an increase in the salary of the
manager of the EDP Department, the employment of a
deputy manager and an internal auditor, and some
contingencies;
- Operations and distribution labor costs will increase
13% during the Project construction period (1972-74)
and 3% a year thereafter; this represents the expected
increase in the number of workers due to the Project;
- An increase of 10% in the total cost of labor is assumed
to take place in 1972 after completion of the consultants'
study on salaries. An annual increase of 3% is assumed
thereafter to reflect compensation for increases in the
cost of living.

Chemicals - Power and Fuel
The costs of chemicals, power and fuel are projected to increase
in proportion with the water produced.
Maintenance
Maintenance is projected on the basis of the Empresa's past and
future investments, with the following assumptions:
- annual maintenance for investments realized up to
1966, which was the first year of routine operations
after completion of the first-stage project, is
assumed at 1-1/2% of these investments;
- for all subsequent annual investments, the corres-
ponding maintenance cost will represent 0.5% of
the investment during the first five years, 1.0%
during the five following years and 2.0% thereafter.
ocher Direct Costs
Other direct costs (transportation, distribution and miscella-
neous) are projected to increase in proportion with the number of con-
nections.
Administrative and General
Administrative and general costs are projected to increase in
proportion with the number of connections.
Provisions for bad debts are projected on a statistical basis
at 9% of the short-term receivables and 60% of the long-term receivables,
as shown below.

BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
Gross Fixed Assets
Additions to gross fixed assets are taken at estimated historical
cost without revaluation. They include:
- Project works for C$70 million and subsequent improve-
ments;
- Connection and reconnection costs;
- Interest on the IBRD loan during construction which is
capitalized;
- Donations from individuals and urban developers. Present
value of the private systems is evaluated as follows:
2 wells                   C$   60,000
Distribution mains        C$3,070,000
Connections               C$  307,000
Total           C$3 437 000
The private systems would be donated to the Empresa after com-
pletion of the project, approximately in accordance with the plan shown
below.

Long-Term Receivables
Long-term receivables are shown in the projections net of pro-
visions for bad debts.
Long-term receivables increase C$150,000 each year, which is
equivalent to the historical increase.
Changes in 1971 will be as follows:
Total long-term receivables at the end of 1970   2.0
Grant from the Empresa                            (1.0)

Provisions for Bad Debts
Annual provisions for bad debts would be 9% of short-term re-
ceivables and 60% of long-term receivables.
Inventories
The value of inventories, now at C$3.5 million, will not change
through 1980 since the increase in purchases necessary for the enlarged
system will be offset by improved inventory management. The inventory lev-
el is now 2.7 times the annual consumption; it will drop to 1.1 by 1980.
Capital from Government
Capital from Government will remain constant at C$19.4 million
until 1980 (i.e., no additional contributions from Government will be
necessary).
Accumulated Surplus
Annual earned surplus is comprised of: net income, connection
and reconnection fees and adjustments to earned surplus.
Connection and reconnection fees are projected by taking into
account the annual increase in the number of connections and a statistical
cost per connection of C$660.

reconnection fees
(in C$ million)
The projected jump in the increase of connections in 1975, 1976
and 1977 is due to the donations of private systems. The Empresa's new
customers, formerly served by a private system, also have to pay the con-
nection fees according to the Empresa's regulations.
The write-off of part of the provision for bad debts on receiva-
bles at end of 1970 represents an adjustment to earned surplus in 1971:
(C$ million)
Total provision at end of 1970                 1.3
Total provision at entd of 1971                1.0
Adjustment to earned surplus                   0.3
Current Liabilities
Current liabilitiesa are broken down into accounts payable, accrued
interest, customer deposits, current maturities on long-term debt, deferred
revenues, and others.
Accounts payable will average 1-1/2 months of total purchases,
including the cost of works and operations:

Accrued interest will represent:
- 5-1/2 months of the annual interest due Government for
its first loan through IDA;
- 5-1/2 months of the annual interest due Government for
its second loan;
No accrued interest has been calculated for IBRD.
Customer deposits will average 1-1/2 months of sales.
Deferred revenues will remain constant over 1980.
