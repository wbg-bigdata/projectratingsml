A.  IndjyEhbanization Trends
1.01    India, although primarily an agricultural country with about 76% of
its 1981 population of 684 million people living in rural areas, is becoming
increasingly urbanized. Its urbtn population of 156 million bas been growing
(1971-81) at a much higher annual rate (3.9%) than the rural population
(1.75%). About 6.1 million people per year are now being added to urban
areas. Over the next two decades, nearly half (45%) of India's population
growth will be located in urban areas. These large increases in population
are straining city administrationis' capacities to deliver, maintain, and
finance essential urban services and to supply serviced, urban land. Rela-
tive to other sectors, small proportions of government resources are invested
in housing, urban development, and water and sewerage, so there is an urgent
need for them to be used efficierntly and for increased investment supported
by improved local resource mobilization.
1.02    Despite cities being the focal point for wealth and income growth,
about 41% of urban households, or 64 million people, have incomes below the
absolute urban poverty income level, estimated by IDA to be about Rs 520
monthly per household in 1980. In the poorest Indian states--Uttar Pradesh,
Orissa, and Bihar--and in some major cities, as many as 60% of the population
are estimated to have incomes below the poverty line.
1.03    While primary responsibility for the formulation and implementation
of urban development programs in India rests with state governments and local
bodies, overall development policies and strategies are influenced by objec-
tives laid down in the national five-year plans. The Sixth National
Five-Year Plan (1980-85) stressees the need for providing affordable shelter,
safe water supply and adequate sa,nitation to the urban poor, and for modify-
ing existing by-laws, land use controls and minimum plot size requirements to
achieve this end. It also favors slum upgrading rather than demolition and
relocation.
1.04    In the early 1970's, GOI began direct funding of urban projects in
the larger metropolitan cities, beginning with Calcutta, followed by Bombay
and Madras. Also, a centrally funded Minimum Needs Program was introduced
under the Fifth Five-Year Plan which resulted in environmental improvements
in many urban slums. But costs were not recovered, tenure was not usually
provided, and local government management and financial capacity to maintain
and service improved neighborhoods was not addressed. Under the Sixth
Five-Year Plan, a centrally funded Program for Integrated Development of



-2-
Small and Medium Towns is financing land development, market centers and
traffic and transportation schemes in towns with less than 100,000
inhabitants.
1.05    Urban policies and programs, including centrally funded urban
programs and a number of technical assistance and training programs, are
directed at the national level by the Ministry of Works and Housing (MOWH)
and its agencies. The agencies of MOWH include the Town and Country Planning
Organization (TCPO), the National Building Organization (NBO); and the Public
Healt:h Engineering and Environmental Organization (PHEEO). In addition, the
MOWH is the principal sponsor of the National Institute of Urban Affairs
(NIUA), an autonomous organization, and it has supervisory responsibility
over the Housing and Urban Development CorporatiOn, Ltd.  (HUDCO), a
semi-autonomous Government of India Corporation which provides much of the
capital for State housing and urban development authorities.
B.  Maharashtra an;Bnbbay Mqetropolitan .Regon (BMR) Urbanization Trends
Maharashtra
1.06    In population, size, and social and economic development, Maharashtra
State in Western India ranks at or near the top of all the States. Only
Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan exceed Maharashtra in area. Maharashtra has the
largest urban population (23 million in 1981) followed by Tamil Nadu and
L7ttar Pradesh and its total population (63 million in 1981) grew at 2.4%/year
from 1971-81: a higher rate than India as a whole. About 70% of
Maharashtra's urban population is concentrated in the BMR and in about 10
other medium-sized cities. The largest urban arieas in the state--Bombay,
Nagpur, Pune, Sholapur, and Kholapur and recently Thana and Kalyan (in the
BMR)--are administered by municipal corporations.
1.07    While Maharashtra ranks about third in per capita income, (Rs 2519
in 1981/82) after the Punjab and Haryana, the state has the largest net
domestic product, state revenues, share of organ:ized sector employment and
percentage of employment in non-agricultural sectors. Large- and small-scale
industry in Maharashtra easily ranks first in India in numbers employed,
fixed assets, value of gross oultput and value added. Also Maharashtra ranks
first in loans from state financial corporations,, industrial licenses issued,
deposits and credits in nationalized commercial banks, per capita electricity
consumption in industry and residences and port ltraffic (through Bombay
Harbor).  Maharashtra's real per capita income growth of about 3%/year
(1971/76-1981/82) is the highest of any major Indian State.
1.08    Despite its generally high wealth and income, 48% of Maharashtra's
population still had incomes below the poverty line (1977). In 1971, 42% of
the state population were identified as living in industrially "backward"
rural districts, in which agriculture is much less developed than in the
average Indian state.
1.09   The Government of Maharashtra's (GOM) urlban policies aim at reducing
the disparity between the industrialized and urbanized wealthier areas of
Maharashtra--the Bombay-Thana-Pune axis--and the backward, rural areas of the
state. Investments in irrigation (only 11% of the state's cropped area was
irrigated in 1975/76), communications and industry are intended to improve



-3-
socio-economic conditions in rural areas. Maharashtra's Sixth Plan invest-
ments are concentrated in power (41%) irrigation (18%) and agriculture. Only
about 11% of plan investment is provided for water, sewerage, urban develop-
ment, and housing. Although the state's annual expenditure on housing is the
largest in India (Rs 24 crores in 1976/77), as a percentage (2.7%) of the
State plan expenditure--in the State with the largest Revenue Budget in
India--it was relatively small. However, Maharashtra's cooperative housing
movement with 390,000 members and borrowings of Rs 114 crores, was the
largest of any Indian state (in 1975), only Gujarat coming close in size.
Private investment in housing in Maharashtra is at least twice the public
investment in housing, servicing land and improving existing slums. Private
economic activity (and that of central government and national corporations)
is concentrated in the BMR and a few other medium-sized urban areas: Pune,
Nagpur and Solapur.
B2bgy MetropplitanRgio( BMR)
1.10    Maharashtra's position as the most industrialized and urbanized state
yn India is largely due to the BMR's weight in the State economy. A 4370 km
planning (not administrative) area, with an urban population of 10.5 million-
(1983 estimate), the BMR is the largest metropolitan area in India. The BMR
generates about 10% of the factory employment and manufacturing value added
in India and about 25% of India's income tax revenue.  Employment growth of
2.6% per annum in organized establishments in recent years is lower than in
earlier years and highest in office-oriented activities (3.4% annually) but
still generates incremental employment of about 51,000 jobs/year.
1.11    Forty five percent of Maharashtra's urban population are concentrated
in the BMR, whose urban population was growing at 3.7% annually. This is
lower than the 4.0% annual growth rate of the decade 1961-71, but still adds
65-75,000 households per year to the urban population. By 1991 the BMR
population is expected to be about 13 million people.
1.12    Eighty four percent of the BMR population are located in the 437 km2
Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) area (see Map 17583).  But the 149 km2
Thana Municipal Corporation (TMC) and 400 km2 Kalyan Municipal Corporation
(KMC) areas, with 1981 populations of about 475,000 and 840,000 serve as
industrial expansion areas of Bombay and have experienced population growth
rates over the last two decades of the order of 5% per annum compared to
BMC's 3.2%. A large amount of industrial investment is concentrated in
Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation's (MIDC) Thana-Belapur
industrial estate in New Bombay. The urban population of the 330 Km2 New
Bombay plan area, which has also been growing at over 5% per annum, is
projected to increase from about 260,000 in 1981 to over 700,000 by 1991 as a
result of increasing warehousing and commercial activity in the area and the
residential opportunities which would be provided by The Bombay Urban
Development Project (BUDP) and City and Industrial Development Corporation's
(CIDCO) substantial, 10,000 unit per annum non-IDA, HUDCO-financed programs.
BMR per capita incomes (of Rs 1376 in 1976) are among the highest in India.
But nevertheless, 50% of the BMR population are estimated to have incomes
below the 1983 Bombay absolute poverty level of Rs 880 per month per
household (Chart 1.1).

1.13    Responsibilities for planning and managing urban development in the
BMR rest in a number of state and CLocal authorities. Investment plans and
decisions in the BMR are made by a wide range of agencies in the central,
state, local and district administrations, semi-autonomous public agencies
and by private firms. As a major employer and landholder and through the
large investments made by its agencies, GOI exerts a considerable influence
on BMR's development. GOM's Department of Urban Development has the primary
responsibility for State Urban Development investment programs in the state,
while the GOM Department of Housing and Special Assistance is responsible for
the housing sector. The Bombay Meltropolitan Region Development Authority
(BMRDA), which is under the GOM Urban Development Department, is responsible
for physical planning and investment programming in the BMR and over-all
regulation of land use (para 4.03 and Annex 15).
1.14    Local government have important responsibilities for land use plan-
ning, within their jurisdictions, jnd for the administration of the Develop-
ment Control and Building Regulations (DCBR). The BMC, which is one of the
largest local government authorities in the world, is by far the most impor-
tant local government in the BMR. In order to strengthen the management and
services in the fast-growing urban areas outside the BMC, GOM created the
Thana Municipal Corporation (THC) and the Kalyan Municipal Corporation (KMC)
in September 1982 and September 19133, respectively and issued a Preliminary
Notification in November 1983 for creating a Municipal Corporation for the
New Bombay area (NBMC). The administrative areas of the TMC and KMC include
areas which were formerly under weak municipal or village administrations
(Map 17583). The NBMC would administer areas for which CIDCO now provides
local government services. The improved revenue, staffing and administrative
powers of the municipal corporations should improve urban management over
time.
1.15    In practice, the planning and coordination of state resource gener-
ation and expenditure in Maharashtra is focused in the GOM Planning and
Finance departments through the mechanism of the annual budget and the State
Five Year Plan. However, the Plan does not adequately take into account the
investment or contributions to urban development objectives of central
government, local government agencies and public and quasi-public agencies
(like CIDCO and the Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Society, MCHS) or the
private sector. Until BMRDA was created, there was no mechanism to coor-
dinate policy, investments and objectives relating to the urban development
activities of Central, State and local government and the private sector.

1.16    For many years the legal supply of serviced land and housing in the
BMR has amounted to only about 35% of the annual incremental household need.
The private and public supply of housing, mostly in apartments, at costs
ranging from Rs 30,000 to over 100,000 (US$2,730-9,090), is unaffordable to
at least 50% of the population, even though low income purchasers of public
housing are heavily subsidized. Since 1974, slum improvement programs under
the State Minimum Needs Program have covered about 2 million people in BMC
slums on public land, at a current cost of Rs 200/capita. These programs,
now the responsibility of the Bombay Housing and Area Development Board
(BHADB) of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA),



-6-
marginally improved environmental conditions, but did not provide for
security of tenure, adequate cost recovery, maintenance and environmental
services. The BHADB also repairs and reconstructs old tenement buildings in
downtown Bombay, covering about 1000 units a year, using funds from a cess
on about 20,000 old buildings (housing 300-400,00 households) and from GOM
and BMC. Because of inadequatte rental income, old (80% built before 1940)
and renovated units are poorly maintained by private owners and the BHADB
program contributes little to the permanent stock of environmentally accept-
able shelter. Institutional housing construction finance in the private
sector is largely supplied by the Housing Development Finance Corporation
(HDFC) and the Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Society (MCHS). Their
programs are small in relation to the need and the potential demand, if
adequate amounts of affordable serviced land were to be available for shelter
purposes.
1.17    Land, infrastructure and housing costs are substantially increased by
provisions in the DCBR administered by local governments. The unnecessarily
high DCBR standards are inappropriate to the needs of low income families and
contribute to the acute shortage of affordable serviced land for residential
and other uses.
1.18    The GOI Urban Land Ceiling Act (ULCA) of 1976 was intended to allow
the State Governments to acquire urban "vacant" (undeveloped) private land at
a fraction of market value, so that low income shelter needs could be met.
Due to the resistance of private owners to surrendering their land, the Act
resulted in a freezing of transactions in several thousand hectares of BMR
vacant land.  The market price of land shot up to put the costs of shelter
even further out of reach of the majority of BMKR households. Little land has
been acquired under the Act by GOM.
1.19    Except from 1925-1938, rent control measures have been operated in
Greater Bombay since 1918. The Bombay Rent Corntrol Act of 1947 froze "stand-
ard rents" of households in existing properties at the 1940 rental value and
properties built later at their initial rental values. Under the Act,
tenants and their heirs obtain a lease and a rent which is more or less fixed
in perpetuity and the standard rent for several hundred thousand Bombay
households is in principle only a fraction of the market value. Owners have
little or no legal means of regaining the use of their property, or obtaining
sufFicient revenue to maintain properties and earn a reasonable rate of
return on investment.  Investment in new, legal rental accommodations, par-
ticujlarly for lower income families, is practically non-existant. Prices
of illegal properties, both for sale and rental, are highly inflated and
tenure on such properties is insecure. Transactions in existing properties
for rental purposes are stifled. By contrast, it has been observed that in
Nagpur, Maharashtra, where residential premises constructed after 1951 aLnd
non--residential premises constructed after 1967 were exempted from rent
control, housing construction has been quite vigorous.
1.20    Controlled rents are the basis for the property tax and therefore
rent: control severely reduces local government revenues from the property
tax,, which should be a major and equitable source of indirect cost recovery
for public services. Consequently, local government resources are inadequate
for the maintenance and delivery of services to existing neighborhoods and
srnot meet the needs of the rapidly expanding urban population.



-7-
1.21    High urban population growth rates and the factors mentioned above,
have led to land and housing being Bombay's most critical problem.  About 50%
of the population live without tenure and adequate services in hutment areas
under private and public 9wnership (Table 1.1) and on the pavements.  Another
10-15% are crowded (3-5 m of space per person) into decaying, environmen-
tally unacceptable, old, multi-story tenements, (chawls) which, because of
rent control, can neither be maintained nor upgraded, despite the efforts of
BHADB (para 1.16). The land and housing shortage in Bombay is worse than in
most other major Indian metropolitan areas. Overcrowding and poor sanitary
conditions are as bad as in the worst metropolitan areas in other countries.

1.22    Provisions for environmental services, including maintenance of
roads, water supply and sewerage, and drains and solid waste collection and
disposal, vary widely in different BMR local government (and CIDCO) jurisdic-
tions and neighborhoods. BMC's maintenance and services for the city as a
whole are well managed and relatively efficient. However, local government
finance, administration and services in the TMC and KMC areas are very inade-
quate and population growth in New Bombay is already starting to outstrip
CIDCO's powers and capacity to provide the management and finance needed for
adequate local government services. The expenditures on services for hutment
areas in all local government jurisdictions is very inadequate and most of
the 50% of hutment households on privately-owned land receive neither
improvements nor services.

1.23    Largely because of the octroi tax, the revenues of Municipal Corpora-
tions in the BMR are high compared to cities like Madras, but are quite
inadequate in relation to the high growth in population and the need, in BMC,
to provide services for natioinal and regional economic activity. In the TMC
and KMC jurisdictions the capacity of management and accounting systems is a
majc,r constraint to the improvement and expansion of municipal services.

1,24    The Bank Group's SUppOrt for urban development in India has con-
centrated over the past decadea on three of India's largest cities--Calcutta,
Madras, and Bombay.  The first Bank Group-supported urban projects, in Cal-
cutta and Madras, financed initegrated packages of urban services (i.e., sites
and services, slum upgrading, water supply, sanitation, and transport).
Follow-up projects in both cities have continued this pattern, although in
Calcutta, three general urban development projects have been supplemented by
a sectoral project, the Calcutta Urban Transport Project, which supports a
program of investments and policy measures designed to alleviate the critical
transport deficiencies in the city. In Bombay, a sectoral approach has been
followed from the beginning, largely due to the strength of sector institu-
tions and the lack of a strong regional developnent authority to prepare and
coordinate a multi-sectoral project. Projects in Bombay have thus far
focused on transport and traffic management, water supply and sewage dis-
posal, including two projects for the Bombay MunLicipal Corporation (BMAJ) Area
and another for Kalyan-Thana expansion areas adjacent to BMC.  A thbiX water
and sewerage project for BMC is currently under preparation. In the case of
each c:f the Bank Group-supporited urban projects, the objective has been not
only to raise the level of urban services provided to the population, but
also to strengthen urban planning and service delivery institutions, par-
ticularly those of local government, and to improve the use of available
resources and local resource mobilization.
1.25    All of the urban projects financed to date have supported policy
changes in urban investment programs as well as institutional improvements.
Policy changes accomplished iniclude: (i) designa changes (e.g., cost per
household for land, infrastructure, and shelter has been reduced by some 75%
over previous programs); (:ii) improved cost recovery (e.g., interest rates
increased from 4-5% to 12% and substantial bus fare and water tariff
increases); and (iii) the gradual shift of housing construction and finance
from the public to the private sector with the Ipublic sector focusing on land
and infrastructure developmenit. Institutional strengthening has included
improved municipal accounting,, financial manageaent and maintenance and
support for planning, coordination and performanace evaluation by metropolitan
development authorities.
1.26    While the importance of improved managemnent of India's major
metropolitan areas has not lessened--and the Banik Group is prepared to con-
tinue involvement in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras--the scope of urban
development activities is inow being broadened to include medium cities, which
coincides with GOI emphasis on development in small and medium towns. Thus,
the experience gained in the major metropolitan areas is being put to use to
strengthen the management of these medium-sized cities.  Urban projects for
Kanpur and Madhya Pradesh represent the first siteps in this direction.

1.27    The proposed BUDP marks a sharp departure by GOM from past policies
and programs towards the investmenit and institutional priorities supported by
other Bank Projects in India (para. 1.25).  The BUDP originated in a Bank
mission in 1979 (and a Bombay City Study in 1980), which identified land,
infrastructure and shelter development as being among the most critically
neglected BMR problems which had niot yet been addressed by the Bank's sub-
stantial and successful involvemient in other urban sectors (para 1.24). But,
it was not until 1981 that GOM set: up a committee to formulate an Affordable
Low Income Shelter Program (ALIS) for the BMR.  Under the initiative of the
Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA), the Maharashtra
Housing and Area Development Authority (CHADA) and the GOM Department of
Housing, the Committee produced an Affordable Low Income Shelter (ALIS)
Five-Year Program in January 1982.
1.28    The technical preparation of BUDP also benefited from  the experience
gained during the implementation of the Bombay Urban Transport and Water
Supply and Sewerage Projects and the Madras, Kanpur and Madhya Pradesh Urban
Development Projects, particularly in respect of: advance programming of
land acquisition; packaging of civil works contracts; community development
work in slum upgrading; strengthening the organization for processing estates
transactions; and the institutional requirements for planning and programming
the shelter sector.
II. THE ;9.GFj4-;2#jP4
2.01    The project forms part of GOM's Affordable Low Income Shelter Program
in the Bombay Metropolitan Region (BMR) for the period 1983/84-1989/90,
including the last two years of the VIth and all of the VIIth Plan Periods.
The overall objective of ALIS is to secure a better match between the resour-
ces realistically available for land, infrastructure and shelter investment
from the private, cooperative, and public sectors and the need for environ-
mentally-acceptable, legal land and shelter (EALS) for: (i) new BMR
households (emerging at a rate of over 65,000/year); and (ii) existing slum
households (UN-EALS) numbering about 1 to 1.2 million out of a total of 1.96
million BMR households.
2.02    BUDP would support additional ALIS objectives of:  (i) shifting
public investment (including non-IDA financed schemes) from subsidized, high
unit cost, apartment construction programs into programs focussed primarily
on producing large numbers of residential, commercial, and small industry
serviced plots at much lower unit costs with practically full cost recovery
(para. 5.01); (ii) halting slum growth by about 1987 subsequently reducing
the absolute number of households in slums at the fastest possible rate, and
(iii) exploring ways and means for shifting private capital into the produc-
tion of legal affordable shelter (in the form of serviced plots and low-cost
dwellings) for low-income families in both moderate and accelerated slum
transformation programs. Chart 2.1 and Table 2.1 (see also Annex I) compare
the number of households living in environmentally unacceptable, and/or
illegal dwelling units for three s:Lum transformation strategies: (i) past
programs continued without BUDP (conventional); (ii) with BUDP, but

na major policy changes to shift private investment directly into sites and
service type land development (moderate); and (iii) with BUDP and with policy
changes to shift private investment into sites and services type land
development (accelerated).
2.03   The moderate strategy, which is embodied in the physical components
of the proposed project, would result in an unprecedented threefold annual
increase in the supply of serviced land (shelter units) in the BMR by the
public and private sector and a coimmensurately large increase in private,
non-project, individual investment in housing built on project plots. Never-
theless by 1990 the number of famiLies in slums would be about the same as in
1983. The project would therefore also seek to foster the adoption of an
accelerated strategy which would increase the supply of serviced plots and
shelter at an even faster rate. Because of limitations in the capacity of
the public sector, an accelerated islum transformation strategy would depend
on policy changes to stimulate an increase in land and infrastructure servic-
ing by the private sector.
A.  ]'IicY_gs_ea
2.04    To enable ALIS to achieve its long run objective of reducing the
absolute number of households in slums, BUDP would support GOM's efforts to
improve policies and institutions which affect the management of urban
development by the public sector and the private sector's contribution to the
ALIS program.
2.05    During the preparation of BUDP, GOM has already made such improve-
ments: (i) for better planning, coordination and monitoring and evaluation of
BMR development programs (such as ALIS/BUDP) by restructuring BMRDA (para.
4.03); (ii) for increasing local government institutional capacity to manage,
finance and maintain essential services, by creating Municipal Corporations
in Thana and Kalyan and initiating action to create a municipal corporation
for New Bombay (paras 4.18-4.21); (iii) for more efficient and equitable land
and infrastructure servicing, by adopting and incorporating in BUDP perfor-
mance-oriented Development Control and Building Regulations (DCBR) for the
public sector and by agreeing to studies (para 2.31) to explore the ways and
means by which the DCBR would by applied by local government to the private
sector, so as to achieve health and safety objectives and through the
approval process also induce the private sector to include in their schemes
low cost sites and services-type plots, affordable to low income families
and (iv) for freeing land for public and private housing development, that
has been held off the market by the Urban Land Ceiling Act (ULCA), by
experimenting with a new scheme under the Act, which is intended to provide
land for public sites and services development and allow private development
to recommence.

2.06    9FSt G2=E9&B,ft_e° Lt_x.&ef                Rent control and property tax
reform, which are inter-linked, are essential to improving the maintenance of
existing rental housing, encouraging private investment in the long run in

maintenance and delivery of environmental services which are not recovered by

2.07    Rent control and property tax reform is therefore among the major
means for achieving the long term objectives of ALIS (paras 2.01 - 2.02) and
supporting the supply-oriented programs of BUDP. With a view to ensuring
that measures of reform do not cause a large and sudden increase in rents
on existing premises, GOM has proposed to amend the Rent Control Act in order
to provide: (i) for new and reconstructed properties (both residential and
non residential) and for existing commercial and industrial properties to be
free from rent control; (ii) for rents on other existing properties to be
adjusted so as to provide a fair rate of return to landlords; and (iii) to
amend the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act in order to fix the rateable value
for property tax on the basis of the actual annual consideration paid by
property occupiers. These proposals are generally satisfactory to IDA.
There has been appreciable progress towards achieving rent control and
property tax reform in Bombay over the last two years. Also, GOI's positive
commitment to the objective of rent control reform in its Approach Paper to
the Seventh Five Year Plan is an encouraging development.

2.08    In support of ALIS, BUDP's objectives are:  (i) to make a large
increase in the public supply of affordable land, infrastructure and shelter,
particularly for low income fami:Lies and small businesses; (ii) to substan-
tially improve Local Government financial and administrative capacity to
deliver and maintain services, particularly the infrastructure created under
BUDP; (iii) to strengthen Governrnent's institutional capacity to plan, coor-
dinate, implement, and evaluate ALIS/BUDP projects, programs, and policies
and replicate the achievements; (iv) through more efficient and equitable
land use planning and pricing policies and more appropriate perfor-
mance-oriented design standards, development control, and building regula-
tions to aim at improved public sector cost recovery and a major reduction
in the public and private costs of shelter investment; and (v) to direct a
larger proportion of private investment in land servicing and shelter con-
struction into low cost units for low income families.

2.10    Magatude angi ioation  f Lcbgpes.  (Base Cost:  US$120.9 million;
Rs 133,.0 crores). About 700 ha of open land would be developed to provide
about: 85,000 serviced residential plots, including about 1,460 plots for
apartment construction by cooperatives. About 100,000 households would be
accomodated in site residential areas. Serviced land would also be provided
for community facilities, including primary and secondary schools, markets
and health centers, and for small-scale commercial and service industries
(Sket:ches 1 and 2). About 13 sites would be located in five sub-regions of
the BMR: (i) the North Western Suburbs of BMC; (ii) the North-Eastern sub-
urbs of BMC; (iii) the TMC; (iv) the KMC and (v) New Bombay (Table 2.3 and
Map lBRD No. 17583). The 700 ha area available in these sites is sufficient
for project requirements. As a precaution, an additional nine sites, cover-
ing 3,36 ha of land have also been identified with suitable characteristics
for project use in case acquisition problems arise on the main sites
(Annex 2, Table).

2.11    Land Availability.  After several years of advance planning, about
70% of the land is already in MHADA, CIDCO, or BMRDA ownership. An addi-
tional 10% is in process of being acquired from private owners at Airoli. To
avoid squatting, land at Airoli would only be acquired by CIDCO when needed.
The remaining 20% of land, in the TMC and KMC areas, would be acquired from
private owners under the ULCA or the Land Acquisition Act and is expected to
be available for use in the second year of BUDP. The LISP prototype
Charkop-Kandivalli and Airoli sites are respectively owned by MHADA and CIDCO
and advance land preparation began on these sites in November 1983.
2.12    Sitg_SgeleStLiRGEritEia.  All sites are located within about 5 km
of concentrations of residential, commercial and industrial activity. All
sites would be connected to the water supply systems of BMC, TMC, KMC, or
MIDC supply for New Bombay (CIDCO). The majority of sites would be connected
to the sewerage systems of BMC, TMC, and KMC. In BMC, these systems are
being installed under the IDA-assisted Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage
Project II and in TMC and RMC under the IDA-assisted Maharashtra Water Supply
and Sewerage Project. Airoli and a few other sites would be provided with
waste stabilization ponds for disposal to the sea or existing drainage
canals. Off-site main roads, stcrmwater drains, and high tension power lines
are available near most sites. Electricity would be supplied by BEST and the
Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company in the BMC area and the Maharashtra
Electricity Supply Board in the TMC, KMC and New Bombay areas. All the sites
in the BMC and TMC areas are served by existing bus routes of the BEST or
nearby stations of the suburban railway system. Maharashtra Road Transport
Corporation (MRTC) and CIDCO's Bombay Metropolitan Road Transport Corporation
(BMRTC) buses ply on existing routes close by the KMC and New Bombay sites
and are supplemented with bus services provided by factories in these areas.
In the mid term, the bus service in NBMC and the bus service and basic road
networks in TMC and KMC will need to be strengthened to meet the new tran-
sport needs of the growing populations. Assurances were obtained that LISP
schemes will only be implemented on sites which have been already selected on
the priority or reserve list of sites or such other sites as may be satisfac-
tory to IDA.
2.13    Agroli.  The Airoli site for about 18,200 plots under the project
would constitute an urban "node", or new city, of about 90,000 population. It
is adjacent to large concentratioms of populations and industrial activity in
Thana and Kalyan and the Thana-Belapur belt of industries in New Bombay.



16-
Because of its location, Airoli plots would attract households throughout the
BMR.  Also, because of its location in relatively undeveloped New Bombay and
its size, Airoli would not be able to draw on off-site infrastructure and
community facilities which are normally available to smaller sites located in
developed urban areas.
2.14      In Airoli, therefore, the project woulcL finance off-site nodal
infrastructure including trunk roads, a channel, bund and holding pond for
land reclamation, water and solid waste facilities and serviced land and
buildings for community facilities.
2.15    Costr_iBd  Bayeout.Planning.  Final designs, layouts and cost estimates
are available for: (i) 15,740 plots at Charkop-kandivalli (BMC-west) which
requires filling and is typical of about 50% of the total area of LISP sites;
and (ii) for the first phase cof about 5,120 plots on the Airoli site, which
is typical of 50% of the area of LISP sites which would be on relatively well
drained, level land requiring moderate fill and land preparation. Detailed
cost estimates for the Charkop-Kandivalli and Airoli sites are in
Annexes 3-5.
2.16    An objective of site planning, is to ensure that no less than 45--55%
of residential plots would be affordable to ver:y low-income families earning
about Rs 250-625 monthly (para 5.14). An additional 10-20% of plots would be
made affordable to low income families earning between Rs 625-875 monthly.
In the layout designs, (Maps 2-5), the plot locaLtionL and amenities provided
are appropriate to the needs of each income group and also therebv strike a
reasonable relationship between the costs of servicing particular plots,
market value, and the payment capacity of the irtended income group.  A high
efficiency of land use would be achieved, with about 30% of gross site area
being used for roads and open space compared to the less efficient site
utilization resulting from applying the conventional DCBR (para 2.05).
2.17    A relatively high average gross resi1dential density of about 145
households per ha would be achlieved, because o?" efficient site pl nning and
the inclusion of apartment plcots. Plot sizes would varv from 21m for
families with incomes as low as Rs 250 /month to,up to lOOm2 for families
with income of about Rs 2500/mo. Individual 750gm4 lots for apartment con-
struction by cooperatives would each house about: 10-15 high income families.
2.18     gergice Standards.  Irndividual water supply, sewerage, and elec-
tricity connections would be provided to each plot. In most sites, high
residential densities, impermeable soils, and the availability of off-site
sewage disposal facilities make conventional sanitation facilities the
least-cost alternative. A water supply standard of 90 lpcd from yard pipes
and 180 lpcd from  individual connections is being used for low income and
higher income plots respectively.
2.19    Most small plots (20-28m2) would front on 3 m and 4.5 m pedestrian
lanes or common courtyards 10 m wide and larger plots would front on roads
with rights of way, from 6m tco 15m wide and bittminous surfaced, in double
lane from 4 m to 9 m wide. Electricity networks, connections and street
lighting would be provided, as would roadside dr-ains and waste collection
bins.  Design standards for laLnd and infrastruct:ure servicing schemes are
shown in Annex 6.  The plans, layouts, engineering designs and standards and



-17-
development and building regulations applied on LISP sites would be in
accordance with proto-types devel.oped at appraisal and will be submitted to
IDA prior to issuance of bidding documents. Assurances were obtained that
plans, layouts, engineering designs and standards and development and build-
ing regulations applied by all agencies in LISP and SUP sites will be accept-
able to IDA.
2.20    Core,,ALagig  ned goupe_,&xpangion.bm!s.  (Base Cost: US$12.3 million;
Rs 13.5 crores).  Core housing would be provided under the project only on
the lowest income plot options (Table 2.4), together with optional core
expansion loans. The core would vary from merely a squat pan, water point,
and plinth for lowest-income households, to which would be added bare side
walls and a roof in row houses for households with about Rs 875/month income
(Sketch 3).

2.21     Benafi4arySegctjon   Procedures for the selection of
beneficiaries include: reserving each plot type for a specific income group,
sample surveys of applicants' incomes and selection by lottery, if applicants
exceed the available number of plots. Higher income and cooperative society
apartment plots for households with monthly incomes over Rs 2,500 and commer-
cial and service industry plots would be auctioned, or allocated following
applications, at prices depending on prevailing market conditions. Plots for
households with middle incomes of about Rs 2,000/month would be sold at
market prices. Secure long term tenure would be provided to beneficiaries in
the form of renewable leasehold agreements for 60 years.
2.22     g_iude  and   .£to          chle.  (Base Cost: US$34.0 million;
Rs 37.4 crores). About 200 slum hutment, squatter areas mostly in all 15
BMC wards would be converted into legal, environmentally-acceptable neighbor-
hoods under the project through the provision of infrastructure improvements,
long-term, leasehold tenure, and loans for home improvement. Also, hutment
areas in the TMC would be identified for upgrading with technical assistance
and funds provided under the project (para 2.31). A total of about 100,000
households (500,000 people) and numerous small shops and industries, occupy-
ing about 300 ha of land would be covered. These would be about 12% of the



-18-
total number of 800,000 households estimated to be living in illegal,
environmentally-unacceptable huatment areas in 1981.
2.23    Land,_Acgqisition,and Tenure.  About 90% of the neighborhoods which
would be improved are located on government-owned land. The remaining 10% of
hutment areas in the program are on private land which would be acquired by
MHADA either under the Urban Land Ceiling Act or under the Land Acquisition
Act. This would demonstrate the feasibility of upgrading such slums, which
now have little or no services, although they contain about 50% of all BMC
hutment households.  Assurances were obtained that GOM will aim to implement
about 10% of the slum upgrading in SUP schemes under the project with
households located on privately owned land.
2.24    Nei&hLoE hpd    pe        Sd arjtria for;Selection.  Three neighborhoods
types requiring different levels of improvement (Table 2.5) including twelve
thousand households in neighborhoods to be upgraded in the first year and a
half of the program have been identified. NHADA would submit annually to IDA
a list of the neighborhoods to be included in the next fiscal year of the
project:. Among the criteria for including neighborhoods in the program are:
willingness of households to accept conditions for paying for tenure and
improvements; demolition and relocation required for less than 5% of huts;
excessive investment in on- and off-site infrastructure not required; and
area unaffected by realistic and essential development plan requirements.
2.25    Co_t_s_Im.   v mee Plai2gi iand,DesgijSndards.   Existing slum
areas; would be improved by providing water, sanitation, roads, footpaths,
drainage, street lighting, and landscaping. Except for public conveniences,
community facilities (primary 'schools, and health care facilities) would not
be provided, as the need is met by existing facilities in or near to neigh-
borhoods. Space permitting, plots for additional shops and residences would
be created for sale to enhance revenues. Assurances were obtained that the
selection of neighborhoods for the slum upgrading program and their plans,
layouts, designs and standards shall be satisfacttory to IDA.

2.28      M_^_ten_--- and E rfnMental.Sgryi_g1.  Local government (BMC,
KMC, TMC and NBMC) would maintain roads and drains, water supply and sewage
disposal systems in LISP and SUP sites and provide solid waste collection and
disposal services, except that cooperatives of residents would be responsible
for maintaining roads and drains of less than 6 m width and for bringing
solid wastes to collection points. Beneficiaries would be charged directly
for maintenance and services (paras 5.08 and 5.12), but the affordable charge
only covers about 30% of estimated costs, ranging from Rs 14 to 35 per
household monthly. GOM has identified additional sources of revenue to cover
local government expenditures for the maintenance and delivery of services
connected with the project. Assurances were obtained that GOM will cause the
project implementing agencies to provide each year sufficient budgetary
provisions for adequate maintenance in areas benefitted by the project, at a
rate of Rs 1000 per household per year (in November 1984 prices).
2.29    The LOGFAS component (Base Cost:  US$18.4 million; Rs 20.2 crores)
would improve environmental services (including maintenance of water supply
and sewage disposal systems, roads, drains and solid waste collection and
disposal) and meet the substantial additional need for services generated by
BUDP in BMC, TMC, KMC and NBMC areas. To test the cost effectiveness of
introducing transfer stations into the BMC solid waste collection and dis-
posal system for Bombay Island, the project would fund: garbage collection
trucks, equipment and civil works for one transfer station at Mahalaxmi,
tractor trailer trucks for moving compacted refuse from the transfer station
to a sanitary landfill at Deonar, bulldozers and other equipment for sanitary
landfill and garages and depots to maintain equipment used in the environ-
mental services. Technical assistance and training funds would be provided
under the project to BMC for consultants to assist in the design and procure-
ment of the solid waste transfer station and for training of management and
sanitation staff in methods and procedures for maintenance of solid waste and
other environmental service faci:Lities.
2.30    Funds would also be provided for a maintenance workshop in TMC and
to BMC, TMC, KMC, and NBMC for equipment and civil works for maintenance and
environmental services particularly in project areas. The equipment and
works required in the TMC, KMC and MBMC areas would be identified with tech-
nical assistance for studies financed under the project of municipal service
requirements and the management and organization need to supply them
(paras 4.18-4.21). The equipment and civil works requirements and costs for
TMC, KMC and NBMC are based on estimates of requirements for prototypical
LISP sites and slum neighborhoods in the upgrading program for the BMC



-20-
(Annexes 8 and 9).  Expert assistance to TMC, KMC, and NBMC to carry out the
above studies and implement agreed study recommendations, including staff
training, would also be provided under the project.
2.31    Funds would also be provided for technical assistance to TMC, KMC and
NBMC for studies of their development management systems, including the
Development Control and Building Regulations applied to public and private
development proposals, in order to promote the supply of affordable shelter
for low income groups. Assurances were obtained that the scope and time
frame in respect of a program of municipal services and improvements in the
development control and building regulations shall be implemented only after
the recommendations of consultants for the progratm have been jointly reviewed
and agreed upon among GOI, GOM and IDA.

2.32    (Base Cost:  US$1.5 million; Rs 1.6 crores).  Technical assistance,
training and equipment to improve and strengthen project implementation would
be provided to the main project implementing agerncies, including MHADA,
CIDCO, BMRDA, BMC, TMC, KMC and[ NBMC and also to the BMRDA Technical Commit-
tee. Programs for training (Base cost: US$0.5 million; Rs 0.6 crores) would
strengthen staff capacity:  in MHADA for administration, estate management,
accounting, financial managemen,t and community development; in the Municipal
Corporations (KMC, TMC, and NBMC) for management and operation of environmen-
tal service facilities and (in KMC, TMC and NBMC), accounts and development
regulation systems; in CIDCO for estates management; and in BMRDA for urban
planning and management, quantitative techniques in urban planning, the use
of conputers, project management and finance, local municipal administration
and piersonnel management in local government. The training programs in
MRADA, CIDCO, TMC, KMC and NBMC would largely be defined by consultants,
financed by project technical assistance funds, who would participate in
on-the-job training to implemen.t recommended systems arising from technical
assistance studies. The relatively modest amount of technical assistance
and training provided under the project is addressed to critical needs, but
also reflects the intrinsic strength and potential of existing staff in
project implementing agencies. All of the preparation of BUDP was done by
implenenting agencies without consultant assistance, with the advice from
time t:o time of IDA staff. Expert advisors provided under the project would
play a similar role during project implementation.. The nature and purpose of
this assistance, training and equipment is detailed in Annex 10 and described
in respect of: MNADA in paras. 4.07 and 4.10; CIDCO in para. 4.14; BMRDA in
para. 4.04; BMC in paras. 2.29; TMC, KMC, and NBMC in paras. 2.30 and 2.31.

3.01    The total project cost, including contingencies and taxes is
estimated at Rs 282.3 crore (US$256.7 million).  Taxes and duties are
estimated to amount to Rs 19.2 crores and the foreign exchange component to
Rs 21.4 crores (US$19.5 million). Summary cost estimates are shown in Table
3.1 and detailed cost estimates in Annex 11. Base costs are in July 1984
prices, except, as indicated in thie report, for pricing, charging and affor-
dability tables and cost tables for LISP and SUP proto-types which are in
September 1983 prices. July 1984 prices are only 4% higher than September
1983 prices. The cost differences involved are not relevant to the purposes
of pricing, revenue and aggregate cost and affordability calculations. Cost
estimates are based on: (a) final designs and contracts for prototypical LISP
sites and preliminary designs and layouts for prototypical SUP areas in the
first year of project implementation; (b) recent quotations from suppliers of
vehicles and equipment; and (c) current rates for consultancy services in
India and elsewhere.
3.02    Consultant services provided under the project are described in
Chapter II (para 2.32 and Annex 10). A total of 468 person-months of con-
sultants and experts, including about 7 person-months of foreign consultants
would be provided at a total cost of Rs 96 lakhs (US$873,000 in 1984 prices).
For training and equipment related to urban management, Rs 63 lakhs
(US$573,000 in 1984 prices) has been provided under the project.
3.03    Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% of base costs for
civil works. Annual price contingencies, based on the projected implementa-
tion schedule, are estimated for both foreign and local costs: as 0% in
1983/84, 8% 1984/85, 9% in 1985/86, 1986/87, and 1987/88, 7.5% in 1988/89 and
6% in 1989/90. Contracts for about US$14 million of civil works awarded by
December 1984 for retroactive financing (paras 3.04 and 3.18), were at or
below July 1984 base prices.

3.04    The project would be implemented over a seven year period (including
advance works) from November 1983 through March 1990, corresponding to GOM's
VIth and VIIth five-year plan periods. The phasing of individual project
components and related annual financial requirements are shown in Annex 12
and Charts 1 and 2. Land preparation works began on the 90 ha. site at
Charkop in November 1983, in December 1983 on about 35 ha. of the Airoli site
and in November 1984 on the Versova and Borivali sites. By December 1984,
about Rs 15 crores of civil works contracts had been let, about Rs 5 crores
of work had been completed and the first phase of plots had been marketed.
The procurement of consult assistance for MHADA, TMC and BMC and expert
advisors for BMRDA's Technical Committee is at an advanced stage. IDA has
been involved in projects with key agencies in the urban sector in the BMR
for more than a decade. The generally good experience with implementation
agenci,es for these projects (para 1.24) and the gciod experience in the
advancie stage of BUDP project implementation indicates that the physical
implementation schedule for the project can be met.

3.07    The proposed IDA credit of US$138 million (Rs 151.8 crores) would
finance about 58% of project costs net of taxes and duties. The credit would
cover 100% of estimated foreign exchange costs (US$20 million), 58% of local
costs and together with the GOM contributions (Rs 57 crores) 73% (Rs 208.5
crores) of the total project costs, including taxes and duties. About 26% of
total project costs would be financed by beneficiaries downpayments on sales
and leases of serviced plots in the LISP and SUP component. This reflects
MHADA's and CIDCO's normal practice requiring beneficiaries downpayments in
advance of construction, especially on sales of serviced plots to commercial,
industrial, and middle to high income residential users. The detailed physi-
cal implementation schedule and corresponding cash flow forecasts incorporate
these funding practices which form the basis of the overall financing plan.

3.08    The IDA credit to GOI would be passed on to GOM in accordance with
GOI's standard arrangements for development assistance to states. The full
amount of GOM's allocation for the project, including funds from IDA, GOI,
and own resources, would be provided in GOM's sixth and seventh five-year
plans and made available to the executing agencies, after consulting with
BMRDA, as indicated in the project sources and application of funds state-
ments in Annex 13.
3.09    GOM would onlend funds (Rs 208.5 crores) to the executing agencies
for the directly and indirectly recoverable components of the project
(Table 3.2) at an interest rate of 8.5% over a period of 25 years, including
5 years grace, except that principal repayments by the agencies on Rs 94
crore of GOM's onlending would be credited to a BMRDA revolving fund. TATE
would be made available to the executing agencies as a grant. Assurances
were obtained that the revolving fund would be established in BMRDA which
would be credited with 45% of the principal amounts repaid to GOM by the
implementing agencies in repayment of amounts on-lent to them by Maharashtra
to implement the project and that these funds would be treated as
non-refundable loans to be used for financing similar programs in future.

The total estimated cost of civil works contracts, including contingencies,
and excluding taxes would be about US$195 million (Rs 214 crores) of which
US$158.7 million (Rs 175 crores) would be for LISP schemes. For the LISP
component, there would be a total of about 110 contract packages for onsite
infrastructure and core houses and 80 contract packages for land preparation
and off-site infrastructure. The LISP civil works contract package for all
on-site infrastructure and ccore housing on blocks of about 1,000 plots each
are an innovation for MHADA and CIDCO, who normally make small contracts for
the construction of individual service facilities.  Of these, a few larger
contracts would have values of up to about US$1.1 million (Rs 1.2 crore).
The average contract value would be about US$0.6 million (Rs 0.7 crores).
There would be over 200 contract packages for civil works in the SUP and
LOGFAS components, totalling US$35.9 million (FRs 39 crores). and the value of
the largest contract would be about US$270,000 (Rs 30 lakh). Normally, there
would be one contract of about US$91,000 (Rs 10 lakh) for the average SUP
neighborhood of about 500 households. In all of the components, the rela-
tiviely small scale and value of individual contract packages, their disper-
sioin in a large number of project areas and the labor intensive construction
methods and low cost technolcogy involved would not be of interest to foreign



-27-
bidders. Therefore, LISP, SUP, BURP and LOGFAS civil works contracts would
be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding.
3.11    Local bidding procedures have been reviewed and found acceptable.
Assurances were obtained that for civil works IDA would: (i) receive and
review all bidding packages prior to issuance and bid evaluations prior to
award for civil works estimated to cost US$800,000 or more: (ii) receive and
review bid evaluations for contracts valued at US$500,000 to US$800,000 prior
to award; and (iii) selectively review all other contracts after award.
PlanptX Euiplgt,and Vehicleg
3.12    About US$14.0 million (Rs 15.4 crores), including contingencies,
would be spent for procuring plant, equipment, vehicles and related spares.
Contracts totaling approximately US$8.4 million (Rs 9.2 crores) for packages
of major items under the LOGFAS component, such as bulldozers and front end
loaders, would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. Domestic suppliers of plant and
equipment under ICB would be allowed a margin of preference of 15% or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. It will not be possible to
group all plant and equipment into sufficiently large packages to interest
foreign suppliers and small contracts for equipment and related spares total-
ing approximately US$4.5 million (Rs 5.0 crores) would be let on the basis of
local competitive bidding. International or local shopping for a few items
of equipment, costing approximately US$1.1 million (Rs 1.2 crores), of a
specialized nature, where there are only a limited number of suppliers and
small amounts are involved, would be procured through normal commercial
channels after obtaining, whenever possible, quotations from at least three
suppliers. Assurances were obtained that all bidding packages for plant and
equipment contracts over US$300,000 each will be subject to prior IDA review
and that all other contracts for equipment will be subject to selective
post-award review.

3.13    Expenditures for home expansion and improvement loans amounting to
approximately US$39.6 millions, (Rs 43.6 crores), for which procurement is
inapplicable, would be made by MHADA, CIDCO and BMC in the form of fully
recoverable loans to LISP and SUP beneficiaries (para 2.20 and 2.27).

3.15    The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against:  (a) 100% of
foreign expenditures for directly imported plant and equipment procured
through ICB or shopping, and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for
locally manufactured plant and equipment procured through ICB; (b) 75% of
expenditures for plant, equipment and vehicles procured through local com-
petitive bidding or prudent shopping; (c) 50% of expenditures on contracts

for civil works; (d) 75% of expenditures on loans for home improvement and
expansion; and (e) 100% of expenditures for technical assistance, training
and related equipment.
3.16    Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for:
(a) expenditure incurred for home improvement and expansion loans;
(b) payments made under civil works contracts not exceeding Rs 330,000
(US$30,000); (c) payments made for locally procured items of equipment cost-
ing Rs 165,000 (US$15,000) or less.  Such disbursements would be made against
statements of expenditures (SOE), for which documentation would not be sub-
mitted to IDA, but retained and made available for inspection during the
course of project review missions. Independent auditors acceptable to IDA
would be retained to carry cut an annual audit of all SOE's submitted in a
fiiscal year and the implementing agencies, through BMRDA, would be required
to furnish the audit reports to IDA within 9 months of the end of each fiscal
year.
3.17    The regional disbursement profile for the urban sector indicates
diisbursements over a period of about six years. For this project, the dis-
bursement period is estimated at 5-1/2 years (Annex 14).
3.1J8    To maintain the momentum of project preparation and enable sites to
be prepared for the infrastructure development and site marketing and occupa-
tion proposed under the project, retroactive financing not exceeding US$7
million would be provided for project related expenditures incurred after
January 1, 1984 for: (a) consulting services and expert assistance for
MHADA, TMC, BMC and the BMRDA Technical Committee and (b) site preparation
(lmnd fill and essential civil works) for the Airoli and Charkop-Kandivalli
sites, wbere construction started in November 1983 in order to allow con-
solLidation of sites by monsoon rains of June through October 1984 and
infrastructure work commenced in November 1984.
F.  AjcS9Yt_gB_,&di&s
3.1.9    All executing agencies will maintain separate project accounts, which
would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. BMRDA will
maintain the revolving fund for the LISP and SUP components. Each agency
will prepare quarterly progress reports, which will include project financial
statements, for submission to BMRDA not later than six weeks after the end of
each quarter. MHADA, CIDCO, BMC, TMC, KMC and NBMC will prepare for submis-
sion to IDA annual financial statements for the whole of their activities as
well as the project, accompanied by a report on the accounts and statements
by an auditor acceptable to IDA, and through B'MRDA will submit these to IDA
within nine months of the close of each financial year.  Consultants, to be
retroactively financed under the project, will commence in 1985 a review of
MH2IA's organization, management and finance systems with a view to
implementing improved systems that will enable independent auditors to
satisfy IDA's audit requirements. CIDCO's accounts are already audited by
indlependent auditors, while 'BMC's accounts are audited by the Municipal Chief
Audlitor. Consulting services would be provided under the project to assist
TMC, KMC and NBMC to improve their accounting Systems. The BMRDA would be



-29-
responsible for reviewing and coordinating project accounts for expenditures
made by the implementing agencies and would compile and submit these to IDA
at the required time. Assurances were obtained that: (i) project implement-
ing agencies will have their accounts and financial statements for each
fiscal year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and (ii) the
audits and accounts will be furnished to IDA no later than nine months after
the end of each agencies' financial year.
G.  Mon:Ltorin   and_Evaluation
3.20    BMRDA will prepare monthly status reports, including recommendations
for corrective actions, for montlhly reviews and action by the Technical
Committee (para 4.03). BMRDA's status report would be derived from informa-
tion, maintained by implementing agencies and compiled into monthly reports
submitted to BMRDA. The agencies reports would include comparisons of
targeted and actual: (i) physical and financial progress; (ii) letting of
contracts; and (iii) plot sales and occupation, tenure agreements concluded
with households in SUP neighborhoods, monthly and cumulative recoveries of
improvement, utilities and maintenance charges from beneficiaries and the
value, number and recovery of home improvement and expansion loans concluded.
Urgent major policy and project implementation issues identified in the
Technical Committee would be raised on an ad hoc basis by BMRDA with the
BMRDA Executive Committee for resolution. BMRDA would prepare quarterly
progress reports on the progress of the project and an Annual Report on the
progress of the ALIS program and submit these reports to IDA and to GOM. It
would also review through contacts with representatives of private
developers, housing finance institutions and building material suppliers the
availability of materials and finances required for ALIS/BUDP and develop
appropriate strategies to ensure the timely supply of these inputs. Assuran-
ces were obtained that BMRDA would: (i) prepare and furnish to IDA not later
than December 31 each year an annual report on the progress of the Affordable
Low Income Shelter Program (ALIS,) for that year, together with proposals for
actions required to be taken to meet the targets for the Program for the
following year; and (ii) review every six months the availability of
materials and financial requirements for the ALIS program.
H.  Sup.ryislo1
3.21    Because of the size and number of agencies involved in the project,
about 175 staff weeks of IDA supervision would be required over the six and
one-half year project implementation period. However, one function of BMRDA
as coordinating agency will be to undertake project monitoring and supervi-
sion which, if fully effective, could enable IDA supervision to be reduced to
about 130 staff-weeks, which is the current average for urban projects in
South Asia.

IV.  MANAGEMENTj_Q2APA                INANCE
A.  Pr2glram and Project Mr!angem!ent
4.01    An important objective of the Project and the ALIS program is to
improve GOM's long-term planning and budgeting capability for land servicing
and shelter in the BMR.  As part of the ALIS Program, GOM is establishing a
process for planning, coordinaltion, and progress evaluation for the shelter
sector. In the framework of GOM's Five-Year Plarn periods, this process is
intended to produce annual and medium-term plannLing perspectives and annual
progress evaluations to feed into GOM's regular annual and five-year planning
and budgeting system.  Key elements in this process were the creation of an
inter-departmental, inter-agerncy coordinating committee (APEX) by GOM, for
preparing ALIS/BUDP and the strengthening of BMh'DA's planning capability
(para 4.04).  During project preparation, APEX met to resolve major policy
and project preparation issues and established the means for coordinating
project activities. APEX functions were transferred in July 1983 to the
restructured BMRDA Executive Committee.
4.02    The project would be mainly implemented by MHADA, CIDCO, BMRDA, BMC,
TMC, KMC and NBMC, whose tasks are indicated in Chapter II and outlined in
Chart 4.1 and whose organization and past performance are described below and
in Annex 15.
B. BMRDA
4.03    BMRDA was established in 1973 to plan development in the BMR.
However, for a variety of reasons (see Annex 15), including its inappropriate
internal organization, BMRDA did not fulfill the role of a metropolitan-wide
planning authority. To rectify this situation and make BMRDA a more effec-
tive planning authority, GOM reorganized BMRDA in July 1983, reducing the
numbier of members from 42 to 17, merging the former standing and Executive
Committees into a single Executive Committee, abolishing the three sectoral
Boards and strengthening the P'lanning Division. The reorganization estab-
lishes a clear line of responsibility for BMRDA's functions, from the Minis-
ter of Urban Development and the Metropolitan Authority, to the Executive
Committee and the new functional divisions of BMRDA.  In particular, BMRDA's
planning capability has been increased with the addition of staff for finan-
cial and economic analysis and by the addition of staff from the former
Housing and Ecology Board after BMRDA reorganization. The proposed project
presents an opportunity, because of its size and breadth of impact, to
cata'Lyze further improvements in BMRDA's planning capability.
4.04    BMRDA has been coordinating the preparation of the ALIS program and
the project since 1981. GOM officially designated BMRDA as the coordinating
agency for BUDP in October 1982. The BMRDA Executive Committee, chaired by
the Chief Secretary, GOM, will be responsible for ALIS/BUDP policy direction.
To st'rengthen BMRDA for project implementation, GOM set up a Technical Com-
mittee (TC), with the BMRDA Metropolitan Commissioner as Chairman, to be
responsible for the day-to-day coordination of the activities of the various
agencies involved in the project (Chart 4.1). T'he Chief of BMRDA's Planning

tance to the TC in overall project management, i.ncluding monitoring and
evaluation of physical and financial progress and the extent to which the
broader financial, social and economic objectives of ALIS/BUDP are being
achieved.
C. Maharashtra Housin and-Arga Develepraent Authorit (MyADA)
4.05    MHADA, which is an agency of GOM operating throughout the State
through Regional Boards, would be directly responsible for implementing about
66% (Rs 168 crores) of the proposed project, consisting of about 68,000 sites
and services plots out of a total of about 85,000 plots (the remaining plots
would be implemented by CIDCO (with possibly the assistance of BMRDA's Execu-
tion Division) MHADA would also be responsible for the upgrading of neighbor-
hoods containing about 80,000 households (BMC would be responsible for
upgrading neighborhoods containing the remaining 20,000 households).  The
project will require a significant increase in MHADA's implementing capacity,
for which provision is made under the project as described below.
0sganization and Staffin
4.06     Recognizing the new aspproach to shelter provision embodied in BUDP.
MHADA is establishing a separate wing to implement the project rather than
use its conventional executing agency in the BE,L the BRADB (Annex 15, para
6).  The intention is that the new wing should develop an expertise in the
efficient implementation of low income shelter projects, which would then be
transferred to the regional. Boards.  An executive order of July 1983 created
a BU:DP implementation wing in MHADA with, initially, some 200 positions under
an assistant Vice President, who would be solely responsible for BUDP
activities (Chart 4). The build-up of staff for the new wing would however,
be undertaken over a period of about two years, as the BUDP program gathers
momentum. Initially, some of BHADB's existing engineering staff, who have
been preparing BUDP, would switch from the tenement construction program,
whic'h is already being run dowrn, to BUDP programs. In order to ensure that
MHADA's capacity to undertake BUDP is not exceeC2e', and that BHADB's
activities contribute to AI.S program objectivE., assurances were obtained
that MHADA would: (i) limit new investments in housing schemes (excluding
repairs, reconstruction and slum improvements) outside the pro3ect, to be
carried out through Bombay Housing and Area Development Board, to Rs
100,000,000 per year during thre peak period of the implementation of the
project, and the layouts, standards and superstructure provided in any new
schenes undertaken by the Board outside the project would be based substan-
tially on the building and development control regulations prescribed for
land infrastructure servicing schemes under the project; and (ii) design
hous:ing schemes other than those included in the project (excluding schemes
executed on deposit) to: (a.) minimize the minimize the average cost per
household for land development and housing construction; and (b) maximize the
percentage of households with incomes at or below the absolute poverty level
in Bombay (estimated to be about Rs 880 per household per month in 1983
prices) in the range of 55% to 75% of all beneficiary households.
4.07     The creation of the new BUDP wing, including Administration, Estate
Management, and Finance Secticns, will also require recruitment of some



-33-
additional staff for later project years, and consultants (para 4.11) would
determine the precise requirements. For the most part, this is not expected
to present a problem, since staff with the necessary experience and
qualifications are readily available within the Bombay area. However, in the
case of the Finance Wing, difficulties have been experienced in the past in
recruiting qualified staff and IMHADA is reviewing means of overcoming this
bottleneck, through revision of pay scales, and computerization of accounting
systems. A Community Development. Wing is being established to assist in
implementation of the SUP component and will be built-up to a staff of some
200 persons during project implementation. A small legal wing would also be
created to support the assistance already provided by MRADA's legal depart-
ment.
Financial .Posjtion
4.08    MHADA's housing programs are mainly financed by HUDCO and GOM while
housing repairs and reconstruction works are funded by GOM and BMC statutory
contributions and GOM grants. Slum improvement work is funded by GOM and
BMC. Planning and budgeting is on a year to year basis and MHADA budgets are
subject to review, modification and sanction by GOM. For the project,
MHADA's planning and budgeting of shelter investment in the BMR would be on a
five year basis. (Forecast financial statements for MHADA's operations in
the BMR are shown in Annex 16).
4.09    Among the financial management problems experienced by MHADA are:
excessive overhead costs due to t:he housing investment program being too
small in relation to staff employed; ineffective control over estates revenue
accounts, because the value of completed works allotted to beneficiaries on
hire purchase are not transferred from construction divisions to the estates
management division; substantial arrears in rents, due to cumbersome proce-
dures and political moratoria on rent payments; delays in realizing revenues
(and liquidity problems) from substantially-completed projects due to late
completion of utilities provided by other organizations; and losses on MRADA
expenditure on construction and on maintenance of rental units (particularly
in reconstructed chawls owned by MHADA). In an effort to resolve some of
these problems, MHADA has recentl.y sold a large part of its rental units.
4.10    In order to strengthen the MHADA project wing for BUDP and to improve
the performance of MHADA's regional Boards, particularly in relation to the
problems described above, funds rould be provided under the project for
consultants to assist MHADA to develop its organization, management and
financial systems during 1983/84 and 1984/85. Consultants have been selected
and would be appointed in January 1985.
D.  The-Pity_And_Iduajp      Develq m or2ra io n (CID C)
4.11    CIDCO, which is a public company wholly owned by GOM, operates
throughout the States and was designated in 1971 as the new town development
authority for New Bombay. It would be directly responsible for implementing
about 12% (Rs 34 crores) of the proposed project, consisting of about 20,000
sites and services plots.

FinancialI QReratiions
4.12    CIDCO develops land acquired by GOM under the Land Acquisition Act.
GOM exoenditures on land acquisition are treated as equity in CIDCO. Financ-
ing for development was initially provided by GOM loans but is now provided
mainly from deposits and sales to beneficiaries and loans from HUDCO. All
costs, including both on-site and off-site infrastructure, management and
interest expense, are recovered from beneficiaries, with commercial and high
income residential developments being sold at market prices to cross sub-
sidize LIG and EWS beneficiaries. CIDCO also provides and maintains services
in its developments, since there is as yet no municipal corporation. Funds
for the maintenance and the delivery of services are provided by
beneficiaries as part of the moDnthly payments to CIDCO. Because CIDCO has no
general powers of taxation, it cannot be expected to obtain sufficient
resou,rces for adequate municipal services as New Bombay expands. A New Bombay
Municipal Corporation would be created to provide these services (para 4.21).
4.13    CIDCO would maintain separate project accounts for BUDP which would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The annual accounts of
CIDCO are audited by independent auditors under the Companies Act.  Forecast
financial statements for CIDCO for the period of project implementation up to
1989/90 are shown in Annex 17.
OrRgni 3Lio  and St#iati&
4.14   The plots produced by C:IDCO under BUDP would amount to about 40% of
CIDCO's total annual unit production in New Bombay, but only about 18% of
CIDCO's projected total annual investment in she:Lter in New Bombay. CIDCO
has a technically qualified team of experienced personnel which will be
capable of implementing the 20,000 plot sites and services component to be
carried out by CIDCO under the project with only minor additions to engineer-
ing staff. However, CIDCO will have to recruit additional staff for its
estates transactions division, which will need to deal with nearly twice as
many beneficiaries as are currently processed annually. Under the project
technical assistance funds are provided for consultants to assist CIDCO to
improve its estates management operations. (Chart 5 and Annex 15, para 8
provide information on CIDCO's organization).
E.  BombgY_&njcial_CorE2rat ion
4.15    The Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC), established in 1888, is the
largest Municipal Corporation in India, and among the largest local govern-
ments in the world. It administers services to some 8 million persons
(Map 17583). Under the proposed project, BMC would be responsible for
providing off-site infrastructure for the LISP and SUP components in the BMC
area.  BMC would also implement part of the LOGFAS component which falls
within the BMC area, mainly consisting of improvements in solid waste collec-
tion and disposal to be financed under the project (para 2.29) and would
design and implement improvements under the SUP component for about 20,000
slum households who live on BMC owned land. (Chart 6 and Annex 15, paras
10-13 provide information on BMC's organization). Important policy objec-
tives of the project, on which there has already been noteworthy progress,
would be to: (i) effect a significant increase in BMC's revenue from property
taxes, through changes in rent control regulations and through delinking



-35-
property values from rent controL for assessment of property taxes
(para 2.07); and (ii) to ensure that BMC (and other Implementing Agencies)
have sufficient revenues to provide for adequate maintenance and delivery of
services in areas benefitted by the project. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that GOM would cause the Implementing Agencies to provide each
year sufficient budgetary provisions for adequate services and maintenance
in areas benefitted by the project.

4.17    The most striking feature is the buoyancy of Octroi revenues which
quadrupled over the past 7 years and increased at an even higher rate since
1983/84, due to basing the tax on value rather than quantity. Property tax,
on the other hand, has been relatively static, held back by rent control
restriction. The implementation of policy proposals under the project, would
approximately double revenue from the property tax on existing properties
thus providing the necessary funds not only for service and maintenance
activities, both in project and non-project urban neighborhoods.

4.18    The newly-formed TMC is not yet geared to providing engineering and
other services and maintenance in its area of jurisdiction. It relies on the



-36-
existixg inadequate facilities, organization, staff and accounting systems of
the former Thana Municipality and other local governments taken over. Due
largely to the introduction of octroi tax, on becoming a Municipal Corpora-
tion TMC obtained relatively high annual per capita revenues (Rs 400) in its
first year of operation. But, compared to the old Thana Municipality, it
also has expanded responsibilities in a much enlarged service area is faced
with a large backlog of service needs and must meet the new annual needs of a
population growing at 5% annually.
4.19    TMC would be responsib:Le for maintaining on-site infrastructure and
delivering environmental services to about 11,000 households in LISP sites to
be located in the TMC. TMC would receive technical assistance under the
project to improve the delivery and maintenance of municipal services and
to establish efficient management and financial systems and also to reorient
the objectives of the Development Control and Building Regulations to
encourage private land servicing for low income iamilies, as part of the
municipal process of giving development permits. Consultants had been
selected by December 1984 and are expected to be appointed in January 1985.
The project would also include funds for experts to assist TMC to manage the
technical assistance prograni and supervise implementation of the agreed
findings.

4.20    Of even more recent origin than TMC is the Kalyan Municipal Corpora-
tion (KMC) created in September 1983.  Being in al less industrialized area
than Thana, KMC's revenues per capita may be less than those of TMC.  KMC's
responsibilities under the project would be similar to TMC and it would also
receive assistance, similar to that provided for TMC, to improve municipal
services and to establish efficient management systems.

It is envisaged that NBMC would be operating by 1986/87 (para 4.12). NBMC

4.22    Each of the executing agencies would be required to submit audited
financial statements to IDA for project related expenditures. In addition,
both MHADA and CIDCO would also provide audited statements on the operation
and maintenance of project components. As part of these agencies' programs
to imlprove their efficiency, IDA obtained assurances that MHADA and CIDCO
would aim to achieve the following performance targets by 1987/88: (i)
design, supervision of construction and management costs, including cost of
support services (administration, finance and accounts) but exclusive of
estate management and interest charges, not to exceed 12% of annual construc-
tion costs; (ii) accounts receivable for hire purchase and rental properties
not to exceed an average of 3 months billing; and (iii) estate management
costs not to exceed 4% of rentals and installments receivable.

5.01     About 75% of total project costs, 98% of LISP costs and 94% of SUP
costs would be directly recovered from beneficiaries through charges for
land, infrastructure and loans for home improvements and expansion, in the
form of outright cash down payments and monthly installments on loans to
beneficiaries (at 12% over 20 years). BMC, TMC and KMC, and public utilities
would recover an additional 24% of total project costs for off-site
infrastructure and works and equipment for environmental services through
property taxes, other local government charges and through user charges at
levels sufficient to service the project onlending rate of 8.5%. About 1% of
project costs, mainly for technical assistance and training, would not be
recovered (Table 3.2).
5.02     The 12% per annum interest: rates which would be charged
beneficiaries for loans for plots, infrastructure improvements and home
expansion and improvement loans are higher than interest rates of 5-7%
charged to low income households by MHADA in its conventional HUDCO-financed
schemes, are close to market rates and are expected to be positive in real
terms, since the annual rate of inilation and corresponding average project
price contingencies over the project period is estimated to range from 6 to
9%.

5.03    Various plot types would be priced according to their size, neighbor-
hood and regional location and availability of amenities. The low prices
charged for small plots designated for lower income households (Rs 250-875
per month) reflect the lower costs of servicing small plots, the lower market
value of their location in the overall site plan and their limited potential
for housing construction. Larger residential plots, including plots for
apartments, which are more costly to service, in better locations and have a
larger potential for housing construction, would be marketed to middle and
higher income households (above Rs 1,250 monthly) at prices which exceed
average development costs/net m2 of saleable area and approximate market
values (Table 5.1). Plots for service industries would also be priced at
market value, while those for commercial activities would be auctioned.
Plots for community service facilities would be sold to government agencies,
or to private agencies in the case of schools, at prices about equal to the
average site development cost (Annexes 18 and 19).

5.04    In all schemes, the on-site costs of land, site preparation
infrastructure and shelter expansion loans would be recovered from
beneficiaries at an interest rate of 12%. Off-site infrastructure costs for
roads and drains for schemes in Bombay, Thana, Kalyan and New Bombay would be
recovered by BMC, TMC, KMC and NBMC from general revenues, including the
property tax, and by BMC and GOM public utilities from user charges for
water, sewerage and electricity.
5.05    In addition to the on-site costs mentioned above, in CIDCO's Airoli
scheme the costs of all off-site infrastructure and of community facilities
required by a completely new city of about 90,000 population erected in a
green field site, would be directly recovered in the price charged to
beneficiaries for plots (para 2.13). The size of the scheme, low land
acquisition and preparation costs, performance-related reductions in design



-39-
and service standards, efficient site planning and market sales potential are
the major factors which permit direct recovery of off-site costs, while fully
preserving other major project objectives.
5.06    The selection procedures would restrict applications for specific
residential plot types to households whose total income falls within specific
income categories. Residential plots would be sold with 60 year renewable
leases. All low income plots (Rs 880 monthly household income and under)
would be purchased with lump sum downpayments equal to about 10% of the sales
price. All other residential plots would be sold with downpayments of 15 to
20% of the sales price. The balance of the purchase price for residential
plots would be repaid at not less than 12% annual interest over not more than
20 years. Purchasers of plots for markets, small industry and commercial
facilities would pay the full price of the plot up front.
5.07    Separate flat rate monthly water and sewerage charges would be levied
on each household on an individual plot ranging from Rs 5 monthly for the
lowest income household on the smallest plot to Rs 10 monthly for the highest
income household on the largest plot. A metered charge would be levied on
households in apartments.                 1
5.08    An additional, separate, f]Lat rate monthly charge for maintenance of
infrastructure and environmental services provided in neighborhoods by local
government would be charged each household initially in lieu of property tax.
The charge would range from Rs 3 monthly for the lowest income households to
Rs 10 monthPl_r for higher income households.  Leases would provide for
periodic review and adjustment of both water and sewerage and maintenance
charges in accordance with changes in local government costs. Local govern-
ment would convert the charge for maintenance into the property tax after
houses have been fully constructed on plots. Households in cooperative
apartments would pay for local government maintenance and environmental
services through the property tax.
5.09    Optional shelter expansion loans ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000
depending on household income would be provided for low income purchasers of
plots. These loans would carry an annual interest rate of not less than 12%
over not more than 20 years. Loans would not be provided under the project
for other categories of beneficiaries. They would raise house construction
finance from cooperative societies, employers, the HDFC and their own private
resources. Assurances were obtained that: (i) GOM would aim to recover
fully all chargeable costs and target beneficiary selection criteria, and
terms and conditions of sales and leases for residential, commercial, small
industry and other plots, and for home improvement loans shall be as agreed
upon among IDA, GOM and GOI; (ii) onlending terms to beneficiaries for serv-
iced plots and housing loans shall include, inter alia, that interest shall
be charged at not less than 12% per annum.

5.10    A pricing scheme would be employed, which would recover all overall
cosl:s of land and on-site improvements from all beneficiaries. Individual
households and small business would not necessarily pay the actual costs of
improvements in their neighborhood and prices established for individual
beneficiaries would entail payments, which would be well within the amounts
affordable in relation to beneficiaries' incomes.
5.11    The average price charged for a plot in each of 4 zones of BMC
(Map 1) would vary directly with: (i) zonal location value; (ii) plot size;
(ii:i) plot location within its neighborhood; and (iv) type of land use. For
example the indicative price of a small, poorly located residential plot in
the most valuable inner city zone (zone 1) would be Rs 2,000, whereas the
price of a similar plot in. the least valuable suburban zone 4 would be
Rs .1,000 (Table 5.2 and Annex 20). It has been. established that there is
generally a direct relationship between location, plot size and beneficiary
income: the poorest beneficiaries are in the smallest plots in the least
des-irable neighborhood location.

businesses would also benefit from upgrading and would be charged an
affordable rate commensurate with business income.
5.12    Plots would be sold with 60 year renewable leaseholds.  Downpayments
of 10% of the sales price would be required. The balance of the purchase
price would be repaid at not less lthan 12% p.a. over not more than 20 years.
In addition, neighborhood cooperatives of households would pay a monthly flat
rate water charge per household of about Rs 2.4 and a maintenance and service
charge ranging from Rs 3 to Rs 10, depending on plot size and location.

and neighborhood location, would carry an annual interest rate of not less
than 12% over not more than 20 years. The total burden of land improvement
and service charges (and home improvement loans) has been designed to be
affordable, with full cost recovery, to all beneficiaries.  Assurances were
obtained that: (i) GOM will aim to recover all chargeable costs and terms
and conditions of leases and those of home improvement loans, and user char-
ges for maintenance and utilities shall be as agreed among IDA, GOM and GOI;
and (ii) on-lending terms to beneficiaries for serviced plots, home improve-
ment loans and slum upgrading shall include, inter alia, that interest shall
be charged at not less than L2% per annum.
C, _Mfordabiliy
5.14    About 45-55% of plots in LISP schemes would be affordable to very low
income families in the 10th to 35th percentile of the BMR income distribu-
tion. Another 10-20% of plots would be affordable to low income families in
the 35th to 50th percentile of the income distribution at or below the Bombay
absolute poverty level. About 65% of the households benefitting from the SUP
component would be at or below the 50th percent:ile of the BMR income dis-
tribution and the Bombay poverty line. The basic monthly charge for the
lowest priced plot would be about Rs 10 monthly (or Rs 24 monthly when water
and maintenance charges are included) amounting to about 3% of the income of
the lowest income household in the target income range for the plot (Chart
1.1) and 13% of monthly income if all other charges for services and a home
improvement loan are includecd.
5.15    Basic monthly charges to households in SUP areas have been designed
to be affordable to beneficiaries and would range from Rs 34 to Rs 78 per
plot.  These charges which include water and maintenance charges, and charges
for optional home improvement loans, would be about 7-10% of the lowest
household income which would appear well within the limit of affordability.
Households in the lowest income groups in other IDA-financed Indian projects
are spending 25-30% of household income on housing. However, implementing
agencies would monitor the demand for low-income plots in the first phase
schemes and subsequent investment by beneficiaries. If the proposed pricing
structure appears to strain beneficiaries' capascity to pay, prices might be
reduced through the inclusion of a larger proportion of high value,
rev,enue-generating land uses in successively later LISP schemes. Revenues
from higher prices on non-residential plots in SUP schemes might also prove
sufficient over time to allowr reductions in prices charged low income
residential plots, while still achieving full cost recovery. About 65% of
20QtPQOQQ households directly benefitting from the LISP and SUP components of
the project would be in the income group below Rs 875/mo. at or below the
50th percentile of the BMR income distribution and poverty level.

Resource MobW4jzation
5.16    The costs of off-site infrastructure, equipment and operating expen-
ses for environmental services and maintenance would be recovered partly from
maintenance fees charged directly Lo beneficiaries; the general revenues of
BMC, TMC, KMC and NBMC; and water supply and sewerage utilities' user char-
ges. An increase in BMC's revenues was achieved in 1983 through municipal
tax revision (para 2.28 and 4.17). Municipal revenue collections in the
Thana, Kalyan and New Bombay areas would be substantially increased through
the creation of the new municipal corporations, TMC, KMC and NBMC and
strengthening of their staff, financial management and accounts, through
technical assistance and training provided under the project (paras
4.18-4.21).
VI.    QIFCATXQN
Benefits
6.01    The main benefits of the project would be:  (a) to support an
unprecedented three-fold increase in the annual supply of affordable, BMR,
shelter units, particularly for low income families, and thereby reduce by
1990 the number of households in i:Llegal and/or environmentally unsound
shelter from 1-1.2 million (50-60% of the population) to 0.7-1.0 million
(33-43% of the population); (b) to substantially improve local government
financial and administrative capacity to deliver and maintain services,
particularly for low income families and small businesses in the jurisdic-
tions of the new municipal corporations, TMC, KMC and NBMC; (c) to strengthen
state and local government institutions for planning, coordinating and
evaluating projects, programs and policies and for replicating the achieve-
ments, particularly in the heretofore neglected and problem-plagued land
development and shelter sector; (d) to demonstrate that more efficient and
equitable land use planning and pricing policies and more appropriate design
standards, incorporated in the DCBR, can result in full public sector shelter
cost recovery, a major reduction inT the public and private costs of shelter
investment and significant investment of private capital in low cost, low
income housing; and (e) to direct a larger proportion of public and private
investment in land servicing and shelter construction into low cost units for
low income families, while still providing large numbers of plots for higher
income housing, community facilities, commercial and small industry use.
6.02    BMRDA's structure, staffing, and responsibilities, and status as a
regional institution for planning, coordinating and evaluating BMR sectoral
programs and linking them to the annual budget and five year plan cycles has
already been strengthened during the preparation of ALIS/BUDP. BMRDA's
capacity to perform these functions would be further strengthened during the
implementation of ALIS/BUDP.
6.03    The project would involve reforms in housing policies and markets
affecting: the costs of land and infrastructure servicing and housing con-
struction; the supply of land for servicing and shelter; and private invest-
ment in low income shelter. It has already helped to increase the priority
being given by GOI, GOM and BMC to reforms in the rent control and property
tax Acts.



-44-
6.04    The project would substantially improve the shelter and environmental
situation of about 100,000 households directly benefitted by the LISP com-
ponent, of whom about 65% are below the estimated Bombay poverty threshold.
These households would also be provided with securely-tenured shelter, basic
environmental services and primary and secondary education and health care
facilities. The SUP and LOGFAS component would provide basic infrastructure,
environmental services, improved housing and -. for the first time in Bombay -
secure, long term, legal plot tenure to an additional 100,000 households,
about 65% of whom fall below the Bombay povert.y threshold.  In addition,
about 620,000 households in BMC's island city wards, about 50% of whom are at
or below the Bombay poverty level, would be provided with better solid waste
collection and disposal services.
6.05    The average cost per housebold would be about Rs 19,625
(US$350/capita) in the LISP component and Rs 5,100 (US$84/capita) in the SUP
conponent. Sixty three percent of total project costs would directly benefit
about 650,000 people with incomes below the urban poverty line and the
weighted average project expenditure per poor urban household would be
US$1220 (US$248/capita) (Annex 21). A substantial amount of private
individual investment in housing would be generated and/or diverted to
project beneficiaries averaging about Rs 14,000 (US$1,275) per LISP household
and Rs 7,000 (US$635) per SUP household. The total individual private
investment in housing on LISP and SUP plots is estimated to be more than the
whole public investment in these components.
6.06    An impressive amount of employment, largely for unskilled labor,
would be directly generated by the project. Estimated at about one person
year per LISP plot, the LISP and SUP components would create 20,000 and 6,000
jobs each for 4-5 years. An equal additional number of jobs would be created
by housing construction works privately funded outside the project.
6.07    The additional property tax and maintenance fees generated from
private and public investment in project properties could amount to Rs 69
crore annually by 1990. By comparison the BMC's current revenue from the
property tax is about Rs 43 crore annually and collections in the former
municipalities of Kalyan and Thana were negligible.
6.08    Without the ALIS Program and the project, the absolute number of
hotuseholds in illegal and/or environmentally unacceptable slums would grow
from 1 million to as many as 1.5 million in 1990, scarce land would continue
to be squandered in costly and inefficient layouts dictated by inappropriate
DCBR, the average public cost of providing a shelter unit would be Rs
30,000-50,000 (US$2,730-5,000) instead of about Rs 8,500 (US$775), measurable
targets for the shelter sector and identifiable means of achieving them would
not be created, the large private investment in shelter would continue to be
corLcentrated in a few expensive units for high income families.
ateQ-ee-tun
6.09    The average economic rate of return is estimated on the proto-type
LISP and SUP sites to be 20.4% (17.9% and 31.0%, respectively).  Economic
benLefits of the LISP component are the estimated rental value of serviced
residential, institutional, industrial and comnercial plots and, of the SUP
coumponent, the increase in rental values resulting from the project. The



-45-
costs, net of taxes, include she]Lter loans and all costs for land,
infrastructure and community facilities. The rates of return for LISP sites
in the various project areas are estimated to range from 13% in the more
outlying Thana and Kalyan areas, to 18% in the Bombay Municipal area and 27%
in New Bombay. Key factors determining these variations are differences in
landfill costs (higher in Bombay, lower in New Bombay and Thana/Kalyan) and
rental values (higher in Bombay, lower in Thana/Kalyan). The rates of return
are also directly affected by site layouts and land use patterns and, for
this reason, a flexible approach to land use planning has been adopted from
the outset. Such an approach is particularly relevant to outlying sites
where benefits may be lower and here variations in land use plans may be
necessary for economic viability., A detailed analysis of each LISP site
would be undertaken prior to implementation and again before marketing,
aiming at achieving at least a 12% economic rate of return, for an overall
average economic rate of return estimated at 18%.
6.10    Project risks are discussed below.  The risk to which the rate of
return is considered to be most sensitive is slippage in the realization of
benefits relative to the timing of costs being incurred, although the
likelihood of such an occurrence is considered low, given the high and
inelastic demand for basic shelter services. A more likely event is that
both costs and benefits may be delayed together in which case the rate of
return is not significantly altered. To demonstrate sensitivity to the more
extreme case, a one-year lag in benefits, with the timing of costs remaining
the same, would reduce the average ERR from 20.4% to 16.6%. There is also a
risk of cost overruns, but these can usually be offset by sales, price
increases and design changes. Although their incomes are also likely to keep
pace with increases in costs. Non-quantified benefits of the project due to
improved environmental services and provisions for community facilities would
possibly be reduced morbidity and mortality and increased productivity of
families and workers. There would also be longer term benefits from institu-
tional and financial improvements.
6.11    Drawing on the experience in shelter projects elsewhere in India and
the Bank's experience with transport and water and sewerage projects in
Bombay, project risks and measures taken to insure against them are as fol-
lows:  (i) &   Aa  lait  for LISP.  Inter-agency programming of land
acquisition was begun over one and a half years ago. With about 70% of the
land required by the project already in the ownership of project implementing
agencies the supply of project land is reasonably secure; (ii)   2&Rg taiqA
gg2ik&  of agencies.  In order to reduce the design, contracting and con-
struction load of MHADA, BMC would undertake 20% of the SUP component and
BMRDA (on behalf of MHADA) and CIDCO would undertake about 50% of the LISP
component. Retroactive financing is provided for LISP site preparation works
that begin in November 1983. The contracting and supervision load in the
LISP component of all agencies would be reduced by packaging civil works
contracts. Detailed multi-agency schedules have been drawn up for all
implementation activities, from land acquisition through the final home
improvement loan stage. Technical assistance by consultants and training has
been provided to support and strengthen MHADA and CIDCO management and sys-
tems, particularly for financial management and estates transactions; (iii)
gg&&_KC Ev   in the SUP component.  MHADA have contacted households in SUP



-46-
neighborhoods (10,000 already sampled) to inform them of the program.
Downpayments on the purchase of plots would be required at the time improve-
ment works commence in a neighborhood.  The issuance of home improvement
loans would be contingent upon satisfactory payment of improvement charges by
beneficiaries; (iv)     _tiJ,,ut                 SL  d_iM3 tjgR.n   galggti°
sgStor1  r_PramgLand_poie t         m       .g. To minimize the risk of delays
in one agency's activities on another agency's implementation of a project
component, GOM has designated BMRDA as project coordinator, re-organized
BMRDA to focus its efforts on planning, established an inter-agency Technical
Committee, headed by BMRDA with support by expert assistance financed by the
project, and designated the Executive Committee of BMRDA to be responsible
for policy and project implementation issues. T'hese arrangements have been
working well during project preparation and the first year of project
impliementation. There is alsco a risk that the institutional basis for
monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the broad ALIS program will
be inadequate since the long-term planning of explicit ways and means for
addressing the problems of the BMR shelter sector, in the form of the ALIS
program, is a relatively novel concept. To offset this risk, BMRDA would
prepare an annual report for the BMRDA Executive Committee on the status of
the AkLIS program, with recommendations for actions to maintain progress
toward established annual targets. Also, through periodic contacts with
representatives of private developers, housing finance institutions, and
building material suppliers, the BMRDA would review the availability of
material and financial requirements of ALIS/BUDP and develop strategies to
ensure their timely supply.  (v) Akggcy,Xgy . ou       g ORA,   E c   tl_na-
The private funds required from outside the project, for constructing housing
and other buildings on project LISP sites would be 1 to 1.5 times the total
public investment in the project. A shortage of housing construction finance
could reduce revenues from sales of middle and higher income project plots,
which have to produce a substantial proportion of project revenues. HDFC and
MCHS resources would suffice to finance the construction of higher income
housing and the project funds home expansion loans for the lowest income
project households. However, there is some question as to whether HDFC,
which :is experiencing a strong demand for funds in other parts of India,
wouldl have sufficient funds to finance the small proportion of lower middle
income housing to be built on project sites. To meet the potential demand
for housing finance from this segment of the market, both GOI and GOM are
considering the possibilities for strengthening housing finance institutions.

1.      Currently, the total housing need in the BMR is between 945,000 and
1,200,000 units.  Approximately 50-60% of all households are living in
environmentally unacceptable or illegal (unEALS) shelter. Using the lower of
these two figures, BMRDA projected that the BMR would grow by 66,000 - 68,000
households per year and by 1990 the total housing need would be 2,430,000.
Three strategies have been explored for reducing the number of households in
un-EALS shelter: (L)_Z_PanytEiotna ,ll2grgms, currently resulting in the
production of 32,500 shelter units by both the private and public sectors are
continued at a higher level of investment; (          MIo_dera_M e ate   meow  h,Lgra-m,
in which BUDP projects are added to substantially constrained conventional
MHALDA programs and continued beyond 1988 by MHADA and CIDCO; and (,IJ-),-
A¢celerEted GrowthgEngErSam in which in addition to the measures in Strategy
II, 10% of total private sector investment is directed into the production of
LISP type units.
2.      StrgtnyL                               .j-o t.,  hout BrDM .  This alternative
illustrates what happens if existing programs for providing shelter are
continued at their presenlt levels. The key features of this strategy are:
(1) 4HADB continues its apartment construction, chawl repair/reconstruction,
and slum improvement programs. These programs produce : 16,000 units
annually of which only 3,000 apartments are EALS units; (ii) CIDCO continues
its apartment construction program. This currently produces + 10,000 units
annually. Private and co-op construction programs (including units financed
by MHCS) continue at a level of -, 20,000 units annually, increasing to 27,000
units by 1990.
3.      Unit construction costs for both public and private land, infrastruc-
ture, and housing are relatively high:  MHADA apartments - Rs 50,000; chawl
reconstruction and repair - Rs 25,000 per unit; and privately and co-op
constructed apartments Rs 75,000, and the average cost per unit would be Rs
65,700.
4       Total shelter production under Strategy I is 32,500 units annually,
increasing to t 50,000 units by 1990. However,, with the number of new
households increasing by 68,000 units annually, the housing supply falls far
short of need. By the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (Year 1990) the
backlog of need would have grown to over 1.21 million units.
5-      S-ate&g-                                                 JD(ith ffP).  This
alternative illustrates the effects of BUDP on the total housing need. In
addition to existing MHADA, CIDCO and private construction programs, a
four-year BUDP construction program would produce 107,200 Sites and Service
(LISP) units and 100,000 units of Slum improvement (SUP) to EALS standards.
Key features of this strategy are: (i) Private developers, co-ops and CIDCO
continue to produce conventional shelter as in Strategy I; (ii) Conventional
MHADA apartment construction programs are limited to Rs 10 crores/year, or



ANNEX 1
59-                         Page 2 of 3
about 400 apartments and 8,000 sites and services units per year on sites and
service (LISP) type layouts; (iii) BUDP programs include both LISP units
produced by MHADA and CIDCO (average 26,800 per year) and SUP units produced
by MHADA, average 25,000 per year. After 1988, BUDP-type units continue to
be produced by MHADA and CIDCO at the same annual rate as in the peak year of
BUDP.
6.      Conventional construction costs under this alternative are the same
as for Strategy I. Under BUDP, however, LISP sites will be produced at a
cost of Rs 10,000 per unit (on and off-site construction costs) with an
additional Rs 1500 per unit for building loans. SUP sites will be produced
at a cost of Rs 1400 per unit (on and off-site construction costs) with an
additional Rs 2000 per unit for building loans. Loans lag two years behind
the construction program. The average shelter cost from all sources would
be reduced from Rs 68,000 at present to Rs 37,200 by 1990 (in 1983 prices).
7.      This strategy also includes the investment of individual private
resources for the construction and improvement of shelter on BUDP sites, at
an average per household of Rs 14,000 for LISP units and Rs 7,000 for SUP
units. By 1990 a total of more than Rs 200 crore of private capital would
have been mobilized. In addition, the tax revenues realized by the
municipalities on the units produced under the ALIS program would be about Rs
69 crore per year by 1990.
8.      Total annual shelter production from all sources would increase from
64,000 units in 1984 to 126,800 units in 1990. By the end of the VIIth Five
Year Plan (1990), the backlog of unacceptable housing would be reduced to
797,000 units (33% of all BMR households).
9.      Strsata&y ._JTJ_A                                                  The
goal of this alternative is to further reduce the housing need backlog by
adding to strategy II incentives that would divert 10% of private investment
to sites and service-type development, and increasing production rates in the
public sector. Key features of this strategy are: (i) Co-ops and CIDCO
continue to produce conventional shelter as in Strategy I; (ii) Conventional
MHADA programs include LISP units as in Strategy II; (iii) The BUDP program
of LISP and SUP units is implemented as in Strategy II; (iv) Post BUDP con-
struction of both LISP and SUP units continues to grow at a rate of 3.3%
annually; and (v) In the private sector, 10% of all investment is diverted
to LISP-type units, with the net effect of increasing this sector's annual
production by nearly 40% by 1990.
10.     One possible way of diverting private investment to LISP-type units
would be through joint venture LISP schemes involving the collaboration of
GOM and the private sector. An additional possibility, not modeled here, but
being explored by GOM, would be to ensure that conventional public investment
programs for chawls repair and slum upgrading resulted in EALS units and
achieved full cost recovery at prices affordable to low income households.

Page 3 of 3
In joint venture LISP schemes, land servicing costs, layouts, service stand-
ards, beneficiary criteria and the DCBR provisions for the private sector
would be essentially the same as in public sector LISP schemes. GOM and the
private owner/developer would conclude an agreement for the private
owner/developer to fund and implement all on-site infrastructure and core
housing. GOM would fund and implement off-site infrastructure and on-site
community facilities.  The cwner/developer would transfer the ownership of
low income plots to GOM, which would sell them to beneficiaries at the affor-
dable prices established for public sector LISP schemes. Because of the
limited availability of long-term private institutional financing for low
income housing, GOM would provide plot and home expansion loans to low income
beneficiaries on the same terms and conditions established for public sector
LISP schemes. GOM would also become the owner of land and infrastructure in
streets and spaces for all types of community facilities. The
owner/developer would own, market and retain the revenue from all remaining
serviced land and any superstructure constructed on it in conformity with
allowed DCBR.
11.     Conventional construction costs under this alternative are the same
as for Strategy I. BUDP and post BUDP costs are similar to Strategy II. The
average shelter cost from all sources will be reduced from Rs 68,000 at
present to Rs 34,000 by 1990.
12.     The mobilization of private capital for housing improvements on LISP
an,d SUP sites would aggregate to over Rs 340 crore by 1990. The additional
tax revenues realized by municipalities would be over Rs 72 crore per year by
19 90.
13.     Total shelter production from all sources would increase from 74,000

functions: (a) planning the BMR physical development; (b) enforcing develop-
menit regulations in the BMR; (c) implementing projects of significance to
regional development; and (d) financing develcpment projects of regional
significance.  BMRDA w'as created to plan and coordinate multf-sector,
multi-agency programs and projects in several regions and administrative
jurisidictions of the BMR.
2.      Until recently, BMRDA had tended to focus on project identifica.ion,
and implementation for its own account in projects such as the Bandra-Kurla
commercial complex. It has also championed the catise of projects implemented
by other agencies, such as the removal of the vegetable markets fron, downtown
Bonibay to New Bombay premises const:ructed by CIDCO. But these achievements
in project implementation have been at the expense of neglecting BMRDA's
planning function, for which a political and institutional basis needed to be
developed.  A Bank-assisted Bombay Urban Transport Project was specifically
aimed at strengthening the newly-formed BMRDA's planning functions.  But the
small size of the project, its narrow substantive and locational range, the
new and uncertain role of BMRDA in regional planning and the need to test the
relationship between BMC and BMRDA interests and responsibilities, limited
BMRDA's early efforts to make an impact on plans and programs for the BMR.
3.      BMRDA's internal organization into three semi-autonomous functional
Boards (covering housing, transport and water management) with a small
central planning unit in a subordinate role, also hampered its efforts to
develop as a metropolitan-wide planning authority. It is also a moot point
whether positioning BMRDA under GOM's Planning or Finance Departments, rather
than Urban Development, would enhance its raulti-sectoral planning activities.
4.      With a view to making BMRDA a more compact and effective deci-
sion-making body, particularly for planning coordinatiag and monitoring the
implementation of regional programs such as AL:[S/BUDP, GOM reorganized BMRDA
in July 1983. The chief features of the reorganization are: (i) a major
reduction in the size of BMRDA's Metropolitan Authority from 42 to 17 members
under the chairmanship of the Minister for Urban Development, with tha BMRDA
Metropolitan Commissioner as member Secretary; (ii) the consolidation of the
former Standing and Executive Committees into c; single Executive Com-ciittee
under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary, GOM; (iii) the abolition of
BMRDA's three functional Boards and transfer of their functions to the Execu-
tivie Committee; and (iv) the internal reorganiZation of BMRDA in four main
divisions, including a strengthened Planning Division (Chart 5). The reor-
ganization establishes a clear line of responsibility for BMRDA's functions

from the Minister of Urbaxi Development and the Metropolitan Authority, to the
Executive Committee and to the new functional divisions of BMRDA. The arran-
gements for a smaller Authority and a single Executive Committee should be
more effective than the previous arrangements.
MHADA
Background
5.      MUIADA is an apex public authority established in 1977 to reorganize
the activities of four independent statutory bodies (for Bombay, Pune, Auran-
gabad avd Nagpur), which, with the Konkan Board created in 1981, operate in
regions of Maharashtra. MHADA is under the GOM Department of Housing and is
the principal agency responsible for statewide housing and area development
schemes. The MHADA governing authority consists of a President, Vice Presi-
dent and seven other members, all appointed by GOM. The Vice President is
the Chief Executive Officer of KHADA and an ex-officio Secretary to GOM.  A
Chief Engineer, Secretary, Financial Controller and Deputy Executive Officer
chiefly assist the Vice President in the daily management of MHADA. MHADA's
main activities are: (a) Housing and land development; (b) Repair and recon-
struction work on chawls in Bombay and (c) Slum improvement works. In the
BMR, excluding New Bombay, these activities are performed by MHADA's Bombay
liousina and Area Development Board (BHADB), the largest in terms of value of
works of the five regional boards under MHADA's control.
Past Performance
6.      MHADA's development expenditure in the BMR (through BHADB) is indi-
cated below:

Housing and area development work has recently shrunk to about a quarter of
BHADB's overall program.  BHADB's housing and area development activity has
been running under capacity in recent years due to lack of land, shortage of
cement and lack of water supply to available lands. The slum improvement
work has covered a large number of households at a very low standard, but
does not provide tenure or maintenance or recover costs.
7.      Of the 2,000-3,000 housing units produced each year in the BMR a
substantial proportion (40-50% of units) has been for low income families

(EWS and LIG families with Rs 600 monthly income or less). However, only
households with incomes at the top of the EWS and LIG income categories can
afford units costing about Rs 10,000 to 17,000 despite subsidized interest
rates of 7% and 8% per annum. Also, as the costs of MIG units (for households
with monthly incomes of Rs 600-1500) and HIG units (for households with
monthly income over Rs 1500) ranged from Rs 35,000 - 100,000, 60 to 70% of
investment has been for a small number of MIG and HIG households.
CIDCO
Ba ckgrk)round
8.      The City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra
(CIDCO) was established in 1970. In 1971 it was designated as the New Town
Development Authority for New Bombay. CIDCO's prime objective is the
development of New Bombay, with an ultimate population of 2.4 million, as a
means of reducing the growth in the BMC. Its principal activities are: (a)
land and infrastructure development; (b) construction of homes, community
facilities, and commercial centers; (c) promotion of industrial, commercial,
and office activities in the New Bombay area; (d) provision of public tran-
sport and communications within New Bombay and between New Bombay and other
areas; (e) maintenance of infrastructure and provision of land services such
as scilid waste removal and disposal.
9.      New Bombay's economic base consists of two industrial areas
administered by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC):
the Thana-Belapur Industrial Zone and the Taloja Industrial Estate, currently
emplc;ying about 41,000 workers. The shifting of wholesale markets from
Bombay to New Bombay is also being implemented. The onion and potato markets
have already been moved and other agricultural markets will be moved over the
next 3 to 4 years to Turbhe in New Bombay. A new steel market being
developed near Panvel will be ready for occupation by 1983/84. These
wholesale market shifts will transfer some 40,000 jobs to New Bombay. Office
developments in Belapur will provide a further 20,000 office jobs over the
next three to four years. CIDCO's main residential development has been in
five zones - Vashi, Nerul, Belapur, Kalamboli, and Panvel, where a total of
10,000 housing units have been completed and a further 23,000 are under
construction. With the quickening pace of development, it is estimated that
the population of New Bombay, including persons in BUDP sites, will reach
over half a million by 1989/90.
Bombay Municipal Corporation
Background
10.     The Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC), ;established in 1888, is the
largest Municipal Corporation in India, and among the largest local govern-
ments in the world. It administers services to some 8 million people



ANNEX 15
Page 4 of 4
-83-
(Map 1). The BMC council consists of 140 elected representatives and is
responsible for a wide range of civic services, including water supply and
sewerage, bus transport, electricity supply, public health and medical serv-
ices, solid waste collection, education, roads, traffic control and slum
improvement. The overall budget for all BMC's activities amounted to Rs 630
crore in 1982/83 (Rs 465 crore on revenue expenditure and Rs 165 crore on
capital expenditure). BMC is the main implementing agency for the Bank/IDA
financed Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects I and II and the Bombay
Urban Transport Project. These projects provide most of the basic off-site
water and sewerage facilities and a substantial part of the bus transport
required by the BUDP components in the BMC.
Organization and Staffing
11.     The Municipal Commissioner, appointed by GOM, is BMC's Chief Execu-
tive. He is assistied by a Director of Engineering Services and Projects and
Seven Deputy Municipal Commissioners, who are responsible for carrying out
maintenance work and providing services in 15 wards of BMC (Chart 6).
12.     Water supply and sewerage schemes and bus transport and electricity
supply, are the responsibility of the BMC water supply and sewerage depart-
ment (WSSD) and the Bombay Electricity Supply and Transport Undertaking
(BEST) respectively. Although BEST's budgets and charges are subject to BMC
Council approval, it operates as a relatively separate functional,
self-financing entity, as does the WSSD, established in 1973.
13.     Various other functional ]BMC departments,for roads, solid waste
collection and disposal and public health, form part of BMC's direct line
management structure. The City Engineer is responsible for slum improvement
and roads construction. Slum upgrading work under the Project would be
carried out by divisions under his responsibility. Under the coordination of
the Deputy Commissioner (Personnel), the Director of Solid Waste Management
is responsible for the collection and disposal of solid waste, removal of
night soil and cesspool contents from unsewered areas, the maintenance of
public sanitary conveniences and street cleaning. The Solid Waste Management
Department is also responsible under its transport division for providing and
maintaining vehicles for various other departments. Departments under the
City Engineer and WSSD would be responsible for maintenance of roads and
drains and water supply and sewerage on and off site infrastructure for LISP
sites, and SUP neighborhoods.
