IZMIR WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Prolt 
Borrower           Izmir Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate (IZSU).
Guarant2n          Republic of Turkey.
Loan Amount:       US$184 million equivalent.
TerrN              Seventeen years, including 4 years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
frgJg#.t           The objectives of the Project are to: (a) assist in
establishing an autonomous water and sewerage authority for
Izmir; (b) encourage appropriate cost recovery policies;
(c) correct deficiencies and expand the capacity of Ismir's
water and sewerage systems; and (d) bring about
environmental improvements and reduce health hazards by
eliminating the discharge of untreated sewage to streams
and Izmir bay. The Project includes water supply, water
distribution, sewage treatment, and sewage collection
components. A technical assistance component would provide
advice and training for the newly formed autonomous water
and sewerage authority, IZSU, which is the borrower.
BEnefIcIaries      The beneficiaries would be: (a) approximately 0.84 million
and RBik:.         people who would receive a piped water supply, and 1.17
million who would receive sewerage services as a result of
the Project; (b) an additional 0.8 million people already
connected to the water system who would receive improved
service; (c) all residents and visitors to the Region who
would no longer encounter the heavily polluted environment
found today. Actions already initiated to minimize risks
and ensure successful implementation of the Project include
correction of design deficiencies in ongoing works,
acquisition of land for the sewage treatment plant, and the
creation of an autonomous operating agency and borrower.
Experts would review safety considerations of the Project's
dam, and an appropriate waste control policy would be
adopted and enforced to minimize the risks of contamination
of the sewage treatment process and Izmir bay by discharges
of industrial wastes. There are no other unusual risks
associated with the Project.

REPUBUC OF TURKEY
IZMIR WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRASAL REPORT
I. ITRODUCTION
1.01     The Izmir Metropolitan Municipality is the third largest in Turkey,
with a population of 1.7 million growing at about 5 percent per year. Izmir
is an industrial center, and 40 percent of the nation's exports pass through
its port. There are serious deficiencies in its water supply and wastewater
collection, and a lack of wastewater treatment causing extreme pollution of
Izmir Bay, around which the City is situated. The proposed project addressee
each of these deficiencies.
1.02     The Project includes water supply works; distribution facilities
associated with already completed as well as new supply works; sewage
treatment facilities; and sewage collection facilities, parts of which are
under construction. The Project also includes a technical assistance
component to provide advice and training for the Municipality's operating
organization for the sector (IZSU), which would be the Project's owner and the
Bank's borrower.
1.03     The Project was prepared over a period of one and a half years
beginning with a World Bank mission to Izmir in July 1985. The Appraisal
Mission took place in November 1986.
IL THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Seotota Context
Country B      d
2.01     The population of Turkey in 1986 was 52.8 million, with 53 percent
living in urban areas. The population growth rate averaged about 2.8 percent
per annum during 1981-1985 (4.6 percent for urban and 0.9 percent for rural
areas). The rate is expected to decrease gradually, and the population by the
year 2000 to reach about 66 million. Turkey is a middle income country with
per capita GNP of approximately US$1,200. Following economic difficulties in
the late 1970's, measures were introduced to liberalize the economy. The
economy recovered, GDP growth averaged 51 per annum in the 1980-85 period,
exports grew at an annual rate of 231, and inflation has been reduced.
Despite these favorable trends, inflationary pressures persist, and exports
declined by about 81 in 1986, due largely to reduced market demand in the
Middle East. Also, the debt burden remains high. Nevertheless, with careful
economic management, GDP is expected to continue to grow at about 5% per annum
through 1990.



-2-
Water Suor
2.02     Estimated public water service levels in 1979 (population served as a
percentage of total population) are shown in the table below.I' The figures
are believed to be approximately correct for today.
Public Service Water Supply Percentages
Urban          Rural          Total
Adequate                63              63             63
Inadequate              14              23             18
None                    23              14             19
Total Population     100             100            100
In the table, adequate supply is defined as supply available from a public
piped system (house connection or standpipe) that is satisfactory both in
quantity available and convenience of access. In the Izmir metropolitan area,
80 percent of the population have house and apartment connections, but only
two thirds of those served have adequate supply.
Sewage
2.03     Sewerage systems serve only 20 percent of the total urban
population. None of the systems include treatment, and only a few have
adequate disposal facilities. Precarious sanitary conditions prevail,
particularly in high density, low income urban areas. In Izmir, about 60
percent of the population is connected to the sewerage system. The remaining
40 percent have cesspits, septic tanks or latrines, many of which are
improperly constructed or inappropriate for local conditions. The sewerage
syst.em discharges directly into the Bay of Izmir and into surface channels and
streams flowing through the City to the Bay.
2.04     The insufficiency of sewerage and the indiscriminate disposal of
domestic and industrial wastes have caused deterioration of rivers and coastal
sea waters, and increased the danger of contaminating drinking water
supplies. According to public health statistics, some 30-40 percent of
untreated water samples tested are unsatisfactory from a bacteriological
viewpoint. Water-related diseases are endemic, with outbreaks occurring
annually in many communities.
Service Level Objetives
2.05     Water supply and sewerage service objectives formulated in 1978 were:
(i) by 1990, the total urban and rural populations should have adequate water
supplies; (ii) by 1990, the total rural population should have satisfactory
exereta disposal facilities; and (iii) by 2000, the total urban population
1'  Source: Community Water Supply and Sanitation, Rapid Assessment of
Current and Prospective Sector Development, WHO, 1979.



should be provided with satisfactory sewerage and sewage disposal facilities.
The first objective has been revised by the Government, the target date being
shifted to 1993. It is recognized that the objectives have been set largely
for purposes of increasing public awareness and support, without strict
implications for project implementation.
SectorC Orwizatioa and Development
2.06     With the exception only of certain major water source operations, the
provision of public water supply and sewcrage services in Turkey is a
responsibility of municipalities and village councils. Local financial
resources and technical capabilities, however, have not been sufficient to
support system development (except recently in the cases of Istanbul and
Izmir). Planning, design, and construction of new systems, therefore, have
been carried out by three central government organizations, and still continue
being carried out by them except for the majority of projects of the largest
municipalities.   The three organizations are:
(a) The State Hydraulic Works (DSI) under the Ministry of Public
Works, responsible for national water resources, major water
source development and operation, and *water supply development
for towns with a population exceeding 100,000, presently about
30, but excluding the largest municipalities. DSI has its
headquarters in Ankara and operates 21 regional offices.
(b) The Iller Bank (IB, meaning Bank of the Provinces), a semi-
autonomous Government corporation responsible for water supply
development for towns with a population of less than 100,000,
and for major sewerage development in all urban areas except
Istanbul and Izmir. IB has its headquarters in Ankara and
operates 16 regional offices. Its shareholders are the
municipalities.
(c)    The General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) under the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Village Affairs (MAFRA).
There are two departments within GDRS dealing with rural water
supply programs, the Rural Water Supply Department (RWS) and the
Research and Planning Department (APK). RWS has 17 regional
offices which supervise 67 provincial offices.
2.07     In general, responsibilities for municipal water and sewerage
operations have been embedded within operating departments which carry out a
variety of other functions as well (e.g., transportation, gas service).
Significant changes are, however, taking place. In 1981, national legislation
defined Greater Municipal Areas, by which, inter alia, administrative
responsibilities and organizations for water supply and sewerage services of
many szm^;:er municipalities were taken over by a nearby large urban center.
Also, in 1981, the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate
(ISKI) was created by law as an autonomous entity responsible for the
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of all water stzpply
and sewerage facilities in Greater Istanbul."'  The Istanbul arrangement
was intended to raise the level of and strengthen the sector
Law No. 2560 approved November 20, 1981 (subsequently amended by Law
No. 3009 approved May 23, 1985).



-4-
organization and to enable an increasing share of sector investment for
Istanbul to be financed with internally generated funds. Law 3305 of
June 5, 1986 amended the ISKI law to authorize the establishment of similar
organizations in other large municipalities, of which Izmir, Ankara and Adana
are to be the next to proceed in this way.
Investments In the Sector
2.08     Investment in water and sewerage has until recently lagged behind
other infrastructural investment in Turkey.  However, investment in the sector
is increasing, and is expected to rise from 5 percent of public investment in
1984 to an average of 9 percent over the 1985-89 period. The World Bank
supported this in3rease in its June 1986 Public Investment Review with the
Government.
Constraints to Development
2.09     Except in Istanbul, and, in the near future, in Ismir and Adana,
responsibility for the construction of municipal water supply and sewerage
systems has been held by DSI and IB, while the responsibility for operation
and maintenance of the systems has been held by the municipalities. This has
had several consequences. Firstly, supervision of construction has not always
been adequate for widely scattered projects under the control of a central
agency. Secondly, lobbying by municipalities for water supply and sewerage
systems has put central organizations under pressure to start projects when
funds may not be available to proceed at an efficient pace. Thirdly,
municipalities, responsible for many other services in addition to water, have
not always operated and maintained systems satisfactorily, and have set water
charges at too low a level to provide for sufficient maintenance. The
situation is, however, expected to improve given the Government's
decentralization policy and the positive experience with the autonomous
water/sewerage authority (ISKI) in Istanbul. The World Bank has agreed to
undertake a water and sewerage sector study in Turkey, the focus of which will
be sector organization and service delivery in smaller towns and villages, and
which may help to form the basis for a future project.
Previous World Bank hivolvement in th Setor
2.10     The Bank made a US$37 million loan to the Government in 1972 for the
Istanbul Water Supply Project (Loan 844-TU), which was completed in 1981. The
Project included exoansions of water treatment, transmission, pumping and
distribution syste. ; for the Istanbul metropolitan area. Project Performance
Audit Report No. 4bi5 of December 1983 on the Project concluded that the main
project objectives were achieved: water production was increased to the
levels anticipated at the time of appraisal, and a reorganization of the
sector was achieved through the creation of the Istanbul Water Supply and
Sewerage General Directorate. Lessons drawn from the Project included the
need to address the problem of unaccounted for water and to pay more attention
to institutional strengthening and training.
2.11     In 1982, a loan of US$88.1 million was made by the Bank for the
Istanbul Sewerage Project (Loan 2159-TU) to provide adequate sewage disposal
facilities and to increase from 52 percent to 61 percent the portion of the
City's population to be served by sewerage connections. Delays occurred in
the award of contracts, but project implementation now is proceeding rapidly,



and 602 of the loan has been disbursed. An Engineering Loan of US$9.2
million, including funds for water supply and sewerage studies for the
Cukurova Region (Loan 2537-TU), was signed in 1985. Total lending for the
sector in these loans is approximately US$128 million.
2.12     The Bank's support in Istanbul helped promote interest in creating
autonomous water supply and sewerage organizations in other cities, and the
acceptance of more satisfactory charges for their services. The Istanbul
model, as noted above, is supported by the Government, and similar
institutional arrangements are being implemented ln Izmir, Ankara, and Adana.
Rationae for World Bank lnvolvment
2.13     The Bank's strategy for its activities in the sector is to continue
to reinforce the establishment of autonomous, self-sustaining organizations in
the municipalities; and to begin lending over the longer term for projects in
medium-size and small cities where the greatest potential eventually will lie
for increasing service levels and achieving autonomy and cost recovery. It is
believed that lending by the Bank for the latter purpose would be accomplished
best: (i) through an intermediary, specifically the Iller Bank if it can be
strengthened and effectively organized for that purpose, and (ii) in support
of local area authorities which would be established to serve selected groups
of close but not necessarily contiguous communities.
XL THE BUORROWER
3.01     The proposed borrower for the Project is IZSU, the Water Sutply and
Sewerage General Directorate of the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality. '  IZSU
was formed on April 1, 1987 by the decision of the Metropolitan Municipal
Council to transfer water supply and sewerage staff and assets from existing
service organizations of the Municipality and combine them into a new,
separate, administratively self-sufficient organization. The change had been
authorized by an amendment making a: licable to Izmir the national law by
which the Turkish Parliament had autaorized Istanbul's water supply and
sewerage organization, ISRI (para. 2.07).
3.02     IZSU is responsible for the development and operation of all public
water supply and sewerage for the Metropolitan area except water sources
outside the area which are developed and in some cases operated by DSI. IZSU
operates six well fields and one surface water reservoir (total safe yield of
6.1 m3/sec.), and distributes the water to 339,000 connections
(approximately 1,300,000 persons) in an area totalling approximately 420 km2
(paras. 4.02-4.07).
L' The Metropolitan Municipality consists of three adjacent
municipalities: Central Izsmir (1985 population of 995,000), Bornova
(205,000) and Karstyaka (350,000). Most municipal services for the
metropolitan area are administered by the elected Metropolitan
Municipal Council and Mayor.

3.03     IZSU follows ISKI to become the second major application of the
Government's strategy for water supply and sewerage in urban areas;  (i) to
shift responsibilities for sector development to municipalities; (ii) to
create separate, autonomous municipal authorities; and (iii) to improve cost
recovery and reduce tocal financial dependence on Central Government resources.
Organization and Staffing
3.04     IZSU is administered by:
(i)    a General Assembly consisting of the Metropolitan Municipal
Council and the Metropolitan Mayor as Chairman;
(ii)    a full-time, six-member Board of Directors which reports to the
General Assembly; and
(iii)    a General Director who is the Board's Chairman and the chief
executive officer responsible for day-to-day operations.
The General Director is supported by Assistant General Directors for
Operations, Engineering (including Planning and Project Management), and
Finance and Administration, and by specialized departments including Legal and
Internal Auditing (Annex 1).
3.05     IZSU's General Assembly approves, inter alia, IZSU's investment plans
and annual budgets; staffing positions; tariffs; and borrowings. The
Board of Directors approves operating principles and regulations; matters to
be submitted for approval by the General Assembly; and appointments of senior
officials and staff other than the General Director and Assistant General
Directors. The General Director is appointed by the Central Government
(Ministry of Interior) upon nomination by the Mayor; the Assistant General
Directors are appointed by the General Director.
3.06     Board Members, the General Directors and the Assistants are required
under the ISKI/IZSU law to have professional qualifications and experience in
their fields. Neither the General Director (at present a temporary appointee)
nor the Assistant General Director for Engineering, however, have had
management experience on projects comparable to the proposed project. IZSU,
therefore, agreed in the Loan Negotiations to obtain by December 31, 1987, the
assistance of experienced project management specialists who would participate
in its Project Management Unit during project implementation (Loan Agreement
Section 3.01[b]).
3.07     Virtually all of IZSU's 1,550 employees were members of pre-IZSU
operating and administrative staffs of the Municipality. They include 169
engineers and technicians, 1,170 technical service and maintenance workers,
and 60 accounting and commercial operations staff. Although the public
service scale for their compensation is low, their competence in most areas is
adequate, as has been demonstrated by their performance with limited resources
against rapidly growing demands. The exceptions, planning, design, and
project management, are the result of the use of DSI, Iller Bank, contractors,
and consultant engineering firms to perform these functions, according to
normal practice throughout the Country other than in Istanbul. The total



- 7 -
number of employees gives a ratio of approximately 219 water connections and
161 sewer connections per employee. The total number of employees is expected
to increase by approximately 500 with the increase in operations during
project implementation.
T g
3.08     Training in IZSU's predecessor organizations was limited to informal,
on the job training. Because of the rapid expansion of the sewerage system in
the Project, and the introduction of new facilities with which IZSU's staff
will be unfamiliar (e.g., sewage pumping; sewage treatment), IZSU intends to
establish a formal training program with the help of technical assistance
included in the Project (para. 5.31). A training unit will be formed to plan,
coordinate, administer, and monitor training programs to be undertaken by the
sewerage design consultant, and by training specialists to be engaged from
established water supply and sewerage organizations in developed countries.
3.09     IZSU expects, in addition, to obtain assistance from ISKI, including
training, in administration and financial management. Experience during the
past four years in ISKI in developing accounting, financial reporting, and
management information systems, with extensive computerization, may now be
applied in IZSU with substantial savings in time and money (para. 3.11). ISKI
will make available systems including computer programs, and will provide
opportunities for selected IZSU staff to visit, work, and obtain first-hand
advice and experience.
Aocounting
3.10     IZSU's water supply predecessor organization in the Municipality''
maintained separate, commercially oriented accounts for revenue, capital
expenses, assets, and most operating expenses, the exception being expenses
incurred by administrative departments (Personnel, Budget and Finance) which
supported other services in addition to water supply. IZSU's sewerage
predecessor, the Engineering Department of the Municipality, used national
standard accounts for municipalities. In the latter, expenses are organized
by input type (e.g., wages and salaries) without recognition of output
function (e.g., sewerage; street maintenance); capital and recurrent
expenditures are not separated; there are no fixed asset accounts.
3.11     IZSU is expected, as a separate, administratively self-sufficient
organization of the Municipality, to have separate, commercially oriented
accounts along the lines of those of the public utility system designed for
ISKI by the Institute for State Economic Enterprises at Istanbul University.
The system, which includes budgeting and financial reporting as well as
accounting, was established successfully in ISKI, in part with support under
Loan 2159-TU, and should serve IZSU as well. IZSU agreed in the Loan
Negotiations to adopt an accounting system satisfactory to the Bank (Loan
Agreement Section 5.01[al).
A department of the administrative branch of the Municipality called
ESHOT, which also was, and still is, responsible for gas, bus, and
trolley services.



-8-
Auditing
3.12     In addition to its external audit by an auditor from the Treasury
(Central Government), IZSU is required under the ISKI/IZSU law to be audited
by an internal auditor who reports to its General Assembly (i.e., to the
Mayor and-Metropolitan Municipal Council). The form of the external audit is
prescribed by law directed essentially to the inspection of accounts to detect
any deficiency or irregularity, and to the certification of the annual income
statement. Although this may be done competently, it omits features
considered essential by the Bank. The omissions are due largely to
differences in accounting between the national standard accounting for
municipalities, and the type of public utility accounting considered necessary
by the Bank (para. 3.11 above). With IZSU's introduction of its new accounts,
the scope of the audit by the Treasury auditor could be expanded, which would
be sought as an addition to basic requirements of the law, and in accordance
with the standard independent audit provision to which IUSU agreed in the Loan
Negotiations (Loan Agreement Section 5.01(bl).
Billg and Colection
3.13     IZSU's sales are fully metered; its billing is computerized and
efficient. Bills are submitted on a quarterly basis, and non-Governmental
customers with delinquencies exceeding eighteen days are subject to service
cutoff. IZSU's accounts receivable for non-governmental customers average in
the range of 60-65 days of billings, which is satisfactory. There are,
however, serious arrears in payments to IZSU by certain Municipality
organizations, which must be reduced substantially (para. 6.03).
suRwrance
3.14     IZSU agreed in the toan Negotiations to maintain appropriate
insurance against fire, other forms of damage, theft, and potential
liabilities (Loan Agreement Section 4.03). In addition, IZSU agreed to
require its suppliers and contractors to obtain insurance for assets of the
Project, and against risks related to its implementation.

rv. PROJECT ANR       SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
Project Area
4.01     The Izmir Metropolitan Municipality is the third largest in Turkey,
with a population of 1.7 million growing at five percent per year. The
Municipality is the focal point of activities in the Aegean Region, one of the
most attractive areas of the Country, favored by oatural beauty, a mild
climate, many sites of historical interest, and a thriving economy depending
mainly on agriculture and related industries. Although Izmir (formerly
Smyrna) dates back more than 3,000 years, the present Municipality is
relatively new, having been rebuilt and expanded substantially during the past
50 years. It is second only to Istanbul in the diversity and magnitude of its
industrial development and has a large and active international port.
Existing Facities
4.02     The water supply system has multiple sources and an extensive
distribution network. Over 90 percent of the system's 6.1 m3/sec water
supply (safe yield) is from groundwater sources. The balance is from a small
surface impoundment (0.4 m3/sec; Table 4.1). Demand projections indicate
that additional supply will be needed by 1991. The distribution network is a
multi-zoned system with 33 pumping stations and 21 distribution storage
reservoirs. At year-end 1986, 80 percent of the population were connected to
the distribution network through 339,000 connections, of which

1,400 were public standpipes. Because 85 percent of the supply is from the
north and transmission capacity through the City is not adequate, 30 percent
of the connected population, mainly in southern parts of the City, experience
intermittent supply and low pressure; and 10 percent at high elevations
receive no supply and must be served by tank truck. These difficulties will
be alleviated to a significant extent by a new transmission main scheduled to
come into service in late 1987.
4.03     In the existing sewerage system, there is an extensive tertiary
network that collects both sewage and stormwater, but there are no collectors,
no interceptor and no treatment facilities. The tertiary network serves about
60 percent of the population through an estimated 250,000 connections.1'
Untreated sewage from the tertiary network is discharged to the nearest open
water course. Eventually, the untreated sewage reaches the Bay via surface
channels and streams flowing through the City, causing odorous and unsightly
conditions, especially during the summer.  Construction of 21 km of an
interceptor and a 12 km collector is underway. The present design of the
interceptor is deficient both hydraulically and structurally and does not
include provisions for the overflow of stormwater. However, the deficiencies
are correctable (para. 5.20). The interceptor construction is being
supervised by Iller Bank, who will complete it under the Project to a modified
design acceptable to the Bank. The Municipality is supervising the collector
construction.
4.04     An estimated 50 percent of Izmir Bay's pollution is caused by
industry. The construction of privately owned treatment plants by polluting
industries (e.g., tanneries, textile plants, food processors) mandated by the
Municipality is expected to reduce industrial pollution significantly in the
next two to three years (para. 5.28). At appraisal, there were five operating
industrial treatment plants and 18 under construction. In all, about 200
firms are expected to build plants to treat their wastes.
Water Cosm    and Demand
4.05     Projections of water consumption are based on estimates of future
population, population served, and per capita use. Water demand projections
for use in determining water supply capacity requirements have been calculated
by adding an allowance for unaccounted-for water to projections of
consumption. Water demand is expected to exceed the safe yield capacity of
existing sources (6.1 m3/sec) after 1991.  Annex 2 includes a year by year
projection of demand. A graphical presentation of projected demands compared
with existing and future supply capacity is included in Annex 4.
Population
4.06     The 1985 census reported the Metropolitan Municipality population at
1.5 million. The average annual growth rate between 1980 and 1985 based on
l'  The exact number is not known since property 3wners are not charged
for sewerage service, and installation records are not kept.



- 11 -
official census figures was 5.0 percent, the highest reported for Izmir in any
census to date. The lowes- rate since 1960 was 4.0 percent between 1960 and
1965. The growth rate is expected to decline gradually until 2015 when the
population within the existing Municipal boundaries is expected to reach
saturation. Population projections used for water consumption estimates, and
annual growth rates on which the projections are based, are as follows:

a/ The 1985 census population for the Izmir Metropolitan
Municipality.
Population Served
4.07     The year-end 1986 populations served by the Metropolitan
Municipality's water supply and sewerage systems are estimated at 80 percent
and 60 percent, respectively. Works programmed under the Project and beyond
would increase system coverage so that the percentage of the total population
served by both systems would reach 90 percent by 1997, and would remain at
this percentage thereafter. Projections of population served between 1986 and
1997 assume gradual increases unti1 90 percent coverage is reached. The
target for the end of the Project in 1994 is 89 percent for both systems.
Projections of annual water and sewerage connections and population served are
included in Annexes 2 and 3.
Per Capita Consumption
4.08     Per capita consumption as measured by metered water sales averaged
126 1/cd between 1981 and 1985. A recent analysis of unaccounted-for water
found that the existing water meters under-register on average by about 25
percent. Actual consumption could, therefore, be as high as 160 1/cd.
(Metered consumption in Istanbul is 185 1/cd.) However, for purposes of
projecting future consumption, historical water sales figures have been
assumed to represent true consumption. In the future, per capita consumption
as measured by water sales is expected to increase to 195 1/cd by the end of
the Project in 1994, and ultimately to reach 220 1/cd by the end of the
planning period in 2015. The increase would result mostly from: (a) improved
service to the 40 percent of the connected population who now are served
inadequately; (b) increased industrial consumption; (c) improved living
standards; (d) installation of more accurate customer meters; and (e) an



- 12 -
increase in the percentage of the population receiving sewerage service from
602 today to 89% in 1994. The per capita consumption projections are for all
categories of consumption, and they allow for projected tariff increases
(para. 6.09), which would not be expected to have an appreciable effect on
demand because of the gradual program for their introduction, the relatively
low present tariffs from which the increases start, and the modest proportions
of household incomes which would be devotee to the services in question. The
estimated domestic per capita consumption used in the affordability analysis
(para. 7.07) is 150 1/cd at the completion of the Project in 1994.
Unaccounted-for Water
4.09     Unaccounted-for water from 1981-45 averaged 32 percent of total
production according to official records. Investigations carried out by
consultants in 1986 indicated that production personnel were under-estimating
production by approximately 15 percent. None of the existing sources had
reliable production meters, and all reported production quantities were
estimated. The consultants predicted that unaccounted-for water will increase
in the near term as system pressures increase. IZSU's long-term objective for
unaccounted-for water, which it hopes to achieve by 1998, is 25 percent, which
is an acceptable target. In the short-term, unaccounted-for water is expected
to increase to 45 percent in 1988 with the pressure increases resulting from
new wells now being completed, and then gradually to decrease to 32 percent by
1994, the project completion date. Steps to be taken to bring about the
reduction include accurate production and distribution metering, and an
increased program of sonic detection of leaka, and of repairs and selective
rehabilitation, in part with support under an existing loan from the Kuwait
Fund, and with the proposed loan from the Bank.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01     The Project was outlined ori-inally in a water supply and sewerage
master plan prepared in 1971 by a consortium of U.S. and local consultants.
The sewerage part of the plan was updated in 1980, and the water part in
1986. Both updates were carried out by local consultants who made changes to
reflect work already completed and changes in distribution of water demand.
5.02     In 1982, DSI began work on new water supply sources with a loan
obtained from the Kuwait Fund. When the DSI improvements are completed in
1988, Izmir will have water supply capacity to meet the projected 1991
demand.  However, water shortages will persist due to distribution system
deficiencies. In 1975, the Municipality began to implement distribution
improvements based on the master plan, but work has been slow, and much more
is needed to strengthen the network in existing areas and to expand it to
supply the newly developing areas of the City. The Project would meet supply
requirements for Izmir forecast after 1991, and would, by 1994, eliminate
existing distribution system deficiencies.
5.03     The Municipality signed an agreement with Iller Bank in 1978 to
implement its sewerage program. Iller Bank first engaged consultants to



- 13 -
update the master plan of 1971. The result was an updated plan calling for
150 km of interceptors and collectors, 11 pumping stations and a treatment
plant. In 1983, Iller Bank contracted the construction of 21 km of
interceptor (Sections 2, 3 and 4), of which 5 km were completed at the time of
project Appraisal. The Municipality has been installing secondary and
tertiary sewer networks based on the original and updated versions of the
master plan since 1972, but is 300 km short of meeting its goal of providing a
waterborne sewerage connection for every property with a water connection.
The proposed project would implement 70 percent of the master plan interceptor
and collector system, provide a sewage treatment facility, and continue the
installation of secondary and tertiary sewer networks.
5.04     World Bank missions in 1984 and 1985 identified several high priority
needs for development in Izmir, including water supply and sewerage. Other
needs were gecekondu upgrading, solid waste disposal, urban transport,
housing, gas supply and land development. In July 1985, the Municipality and
the Government indicated to the Bank that water supply and sewerage were
Izmir's highest priority; that they were the areas where solutions were
identified and preparations most advanced; and that Bank financing for them
was desired. The Government confirmed the request in a telex dated July 23,
1985. On January 28, 1986, the Bank approved a US$1.0 million PPF advance
(increased by amendment to US$1.5 million on September 8, 1986) to assist the
Municipality in preparing the Project.
ot Obi
5.05     The objectives of the Project are:
(a) to help strengthen the institutional structure of the
Municipality through assisting in the establishment of an
autonomous water and sewerage authority (paras. 3.06, 3.08, and
5.15);
(b) to encourage the establishment and implementation of appropriate
cost recovery policies (paras. 6.09 and 6.10);
(c) to enable the Municipality to correct existing deficiencies, and
to provide adequately, at least cost, for expanding requirements
for water and sewerage services (paras. 5.08 to 5.14); and
(d) to bring about environmental improvements and reduce health
hazards caused by the discharge of untreated sewage to streams
and Izmir Bay (paras. 2.03 and 7.06).
Objectives (c) and (d) would contribute indirectly to growth of industry. The
Project also would provide employment during a period of increasing
unemploymeat resulting from a diminishing demand for Turkish labor overseas.
Ratonale for World Bank SuPot for th Pro-fet
5.06     The Project would support the Bank's strategy of promoting autonomous
water supply and sewerage authorities in Turkey's larger municipalities. The
Bank would help to ensure that the new agency (IZSU) to be formed with the
Project would receive the assistance and support it needs to implement
appropriate tariff policies, sound financial planning, least-cost solutions,



- 14 -
control of unaccounted-for water, sound design and construction, effective
maintenance, and monitoring and control of industrial wastes. At a time when
the Government is attempting to reduce public investments, it is essential
that the investments that are made are necessary and are carried out
efficiently. Participation of the Bank should help to ensure this result.
Proleet DesoriDtion
5.07     The Project is shown on IBRD Map No. 20378R, and consists of the
following components:
Part A: Water SuwPly and Distribution
1.   Completion of the construction of the Tahtali Dam and Reservoir;
2.   construction for the Tahtali System of an intake, water
treatment plant, treated water storage, pumping station, 32 km
of raw and treated water transmission main, and a terminal
storage reservoir near the center of demand in the southern half
of the distribution network;
3.   expansion and reinforcement of the water distribution network,
including the construction of 320 km of primary
distribution,' 800 km of secondarT distribution,1'
23 pumping stations, and 179,000 m of distribution storage;
4.   rehabilitation or replacement of: 77 km of distribution main;
50,000 customer meters; 50,000 service connections; 5 source
meters; and
5.   200,000 new metered water connections.
Part B: Sewage Collection and Treatment
1.   Construction of interceptor Section 1 (5.0 km length; 4.0 m
diameter);
2.   completion of the construction of interceptor Sections 2,3 and 4
(21.0 km length; 2.0 - 3.6 m diameter);
3.   construction of sewage treatment facilities comprising a series
of stabilization ponds, capacity of 8 m3/sec, including
influent and effluent pumping stations;
4.   construction of seven interceptor and collector pumping stations
and associated force mains;
5.   construction of 69 km of collectors (1.0 - 2.5 m diameter);
6.   construction of 431 km of secondary and tertiary sewers (0.2 -
0.8 m diameter);
7.   rehabilitation or replacement of 77 km of secondary and tertiary
sewers; and
~'   Primary distribution mains include sizes of 300 mm to 1,000 m
diameter, and secondary mains, 100 mm to 200 mm diameter.



- 15 -
8.   300,000 sewerage connections (using appropriate technologies for
low income areas).
Part C: ntitutional Improvement oR IZSU
1.   Technical assistance in the areas of unaccounted-for water
control, industrial waste management, and institutional
strengthening of IZSU;
2.   training in the operation and maintenance of facilities
constructed under the Project; and
3.   operation and maintenance vehicles and equipment, including
equipment for the detection and repair of leaks, source meters,
and laboratory equipment.
5.08     Water SupP1Y - The Tahtali Water Supply System, Parts Al and A2 of
the Project, would provide supply capacity adequate to meet the year 2005
production requirement. The Tahtali works, in addition to providing added
supply capacity, would also increase system reliability in the southern half
of the distribution area where service has been deficient mainly due to lack
of system capacity to convey water from northern sources. In the first few
years of their operation, they would replace water now being provided from the
northern sources; however, in the medium-term, the need for them is based on
gross demand requirements for the entire system, and they are not merely a
means for overcoming distribution deficiencies. Annex 2 indicates how
existing and future sources of supply, including the Tahtali works, would
satisfy projected water needs.
5.09     The water distribution network expansion, Part A3 of the Project, and
the system rehabilitation, Parts A4 and AS, would continue the ongoing program
to expand and upgrade the distribution network which began in 1975 based on
the 1971 master plan, and now would continue based on the recent update of the
plan. Over 600 km of pipe have been installed since 1975. On completion of
the Project, the distribution network would be adequate to supply the 1995
demand, and properties connected to the system would have 24-hour-a-day
service at adequate pressure. The installation of source meters would allow
accurate accounting of water produced necessary for future planning and
monitoring the results of an ongoing unaccounted-for water reduction program.
5.10     New water and sewer connections included under Parts A5 and B1 of the
project would increase service coverage to 89 percent for both services. To
meet this target, IZSU would install some 26,000 water connections and 38,000
sewer connections annually. This is feasible since ESHOT, IZSU's water supply
predecessor, installed 60,000 connections in 1981.
5.11     Sewerage - Parts B1 through B6 of the Project would complete the
sanitary sewage collection and treatment system, of which Part B2 was started
in 1983 by Iller Bank, and would complete the secondary and tertiary sewage
collection network expansion program of the Municipality. The system
following completion of the Project would intercept and treat 70 percent of
the domestic waste and 60 percent of the industrial waste which now enter
Izmir Bay untreated. The other 40 percent of the industrial waste would be
treated by privately owned plants.



- 16 -
5.12     The sewage treatment plant would consist of a stabilization pond
syst-m designed to produce an effluent equivalent or superior to that from a
conventional secondary treatment plant. The plant would be located on 2,870
ha. of undeveloped land northeast of the City (paras. 5.24 to 5.27).
Construction under the Project will use approximately 1,000 ha, leaving an
adequate area for future expansion.
5.13     The interceptor and the pumping stations would be designed for dry
weather flows. The existing system, although originally intended as a
sanitary system only, has many surface water connections which cannot be
removed or modified economically. The proposed collector system would
continue to carry surface water flows which will be discharged through
stormwater overflows.
5.14     The rehabilitation and replacement component, Part B7 of the Project,
would replace mostly undersized and improperly installed sewers and old sewers
which have deteriorated with age.
5.15     Technical Assistance and Trainin8 - IZSU has incorporated: (a) the
former water department of ESIOTs which has adequate operating capability, and
(b) the sewerage division of the Engineering Department of the Municipality,
which requires strengthening. Part Cl of the Project would provide technical
assistance for strengthening, for which terms-of-reference have been agreed
(available in the Project File). A program for the training of personnel for
facilities to be constructed under the Project is included under Part C2 of
the Project. The program is discussed further in paras. 5.31 and 5.32.
Equipment would be provided under Part C3 of the Project to strengthen the new
organization's operation and maintenance capability and its program for the
reduction of unaccounted-for water, and to equip a laboratory for monitoring
of industrial wastes.   Source meters to measure service output would be
procured to improve production statistics for the program to reduce
unaccounted-for water.
Pro*ect Cost
5.16     The Project's cost is estimated at US$521.8 million excluding
interest during construction. Allowances for value added taxes totalling an
estimated US$48.0 million are included in the estimated local costs of taxed
items. IZSU must pay a ten percent value added tax on all local cost items
except land. No allowances for duties and taxes on imported goods and foreign
consultants are included in the estimate since IZSU is exempt. Enginering and
technical assistance costs include the cost of consultants and the salaries of
local agency staff participating in the Project. Consulting services for
project coordination, design, construction supervision, technical assistance,
and training are estimated at US$18.1 million (US$17.3 million in base
costs). Man-month requirements for all consulting services are estimated at
4,500 man-months, of which 900 man-months would be for foreign consultants.
Approximately 95800 man-months of engineering and administration with an
estimated value of US$9.7 million would be provided by the staffs of IZSU, DSI
and Iller Bank.
5.17     The estimated project cost by component is sununarized in Table 5.1.
The total amount includes physical contingencies of US$39.4 million (nine



- 17 -
percent of base cost for equipment, materials, and civil works) and price
contingencies of US$31.2 million (about 6 percent of the US$ base cost plus
physical contingencies calculated in January 1, 1987 prices; the assumed
annual rates of inflation of US$ prices are 32 for 1987, 12 for 1988 through
1990, and 3.5% for 1991 through 1994). The estimated foreign exchange
requirement is US$225.4 million (43 percent of the total cost). The bases for
the cost estimates are outlined in Annex 5. Detailed estimates are in the
Project File.

Exeoution of the Proeot
5.18     The Project would be implemented by IZSU and two Central Government
agencies, DSI and Us under the overall coordination of the Project Management
Unit established within IZSU (para.3.06). Even with the intended
strengthening of its Project Management Unit, IZSU's administrative capacity
to undertake a project of this scope would not be sufficient. Heavy reliance
will, therefore, be placed on the Project's engineering consulting firms, and
on DSI, for necessary administrative work (paras. 5.19 - 5.21).
5.19     DSI is implementing the Tahtali Dam, Water Treatment Plant, and
Transmission System, Parts Al and A2 of the Project. The Dams which is being
financed wholly by DSI, was designed by DSI engineers and is under
construction. The water treatment plant and transmission system associated
with the Dam would be designed by a joint venture of foreign and local
consultants hired by rn. DSI would supervise the construction with its own
staff. The Dam will be located in a seismically active region. The
Government agreed in the Loan Negotiations to have the Dam inspected during
and after its construction as an additional safety measure (Guarantee
Agreement Section 3.02), recognizing that principal reliance for the soundness
of the structure is placed upon DSI, which is an experienced, competent
organization.
5.20     Turkish contractors hired by Iller Bank in 1983 (Guris; Celal Ece;
Aryapi) will complete interceptor Sections 2, 3, and 4 (Part B2 of the
Project). Because of serious deficiencies in the contractors' designs of
Sections 3 and 4, special consulting engineers recently have been engaged by
the Municipality to prepare analyses and criteria for design changes. The
consulting engineers (Su Yapi Consultants, Turkey) will work with the
cooperation of Iller Bank to supervise the engineers of the contractors who
will prepare revised designs. The consulting engineers would assist Iller
Bank in supervising construction to be carried out in accordance with the
revised designs. IZSU agreed in the Loan Negotiations to provide revised
designs acceptable to the Bank by September 30, 1987 (Loan Agreement Section
3.02[a]).
5.21     A joint venture of foreign and local consultants (Black & Veatch
International, U.S., and Su Yapi Consultants) has been selected to design the
major sewerage works included in Part B of the Project except those works
being implemented by Iller Bank. It is intended that these or other
consultants in due course will be engaged also to supervise construction of
the non-Iller Bank works and operate them for one year. Final designs for the
major water distribution works, Part A3 of the Project, are complete. IZSU's
engineering staff would supervise the construction of these works. Secondary
distribution mains with an estimated value of US$30 million would be installed
by IZSU's construction department. IZSU would also implement all tertiary
water distribution and sewerage works, including house connections, with its
own engineering and construction staff. To assist its staff in assuring that
design and construction standards for these works would be satisfactory, IZSU
would engage specialists to be attached to its Project Management Unit who
would monitor activities and advise when improvement is fou.id to be necessary.



- 19 -
5.22     IZSU's Project Management Unit would have responsibility for
monitoring project expenditures, preparing requests for World Bank
disbursements, and preparing consolidated reports on progress, in addition to
its responsibilities for overall project management and coordination.
5.23     Approximately 45 percent of the Project is ready for bidding or at a
more advanced stage (Annex 7). Final designs of the remaining works are
expected to be completed by December 31, 1987. Terms-of-reference for
technical assistance, Part C3 of the Project, are complete. The planned
project completion date is December 31, 1994 (Annex 6).
Land Acquistion and Resettlement
5.24     Land requirements for the various project components are substantial
(Table 5.2). Approximately 45 percent of the land required for the Tahtali
Dam and Reservoir has already been obtained. The expropriation process for
land for the sewage treatment plant is well underway, and scheduled to be
completed by end 1988. Approximately 40 percent of the land for sewage
treatment will be used for treatment plant construction programmed under the
Project. The other 60 percent is being obtained for future expansion. Land
for sewage collector rights-of-way, water supply and sewage pumping stations,
and distribu.ion reservoirs, will be acquired during the final design of these
facilities.

- 20 -
5.25     In the expropriation process by which the privately owned portions
of the land needed are being obtained (Law No. 2942), the three most critical
steps are: (i) formal determination of the need in the public interest, (ii)
assessment of fair market value, and (iii) budgeting of the necessary funds.
These steps have been completed for privately owned portions of the treatment
plant land as well as the Tahtali land, accepting, in the case of the
treatment plant land, that approximately one-half of the funds are formally
budgeted for 1987, and the other half are programmed for 1988. From this
point, private owners have the right to dispute the assessment of value in
court, but once purchase funds have been deposited for them, they may not
prevent the taking possession and use of the land for the intended public
interest. Because of this and the fact that virtually all of the other
portions of the land needed are publicly owned and to be provided by
administrative transfer, the land needed for the Project may be considered
already assured.   IZSU agreed in the Loan Negotiations:  (i) to complete by
December 31, 1988, the acquisition of the land needed for sewage treatment
plant construction under the Project (estimated to total 1,000 ha.); and (ii)
to have disbursements from the loan begin for the major sewerage works to be
financed by it (i.e., interceptor Section 1, pumping stations, treatment
plant) only after this land acquisition is completed (Section 3.02(b) and
para. 3 of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement).
5.26     The acquisition  of land for the Tahtali Dam and Reserooir will
displace 905 families totalling 3,600 persons, for whom DSI has prepared a
preliminary resettlement plan. Detailed planning and implementation is the
responsibility of the Ismir Department of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Village Affairs. The preliminary plan envisages that a site (at
Pancar, approximately 15 km from the Tahtali reservoir) originally intended
for resettlement of persons displaced by the Ataturk Dam and Reservoir in
Eastern Turkey, will be offered to Tahtali resettlers. Preparation of
1,000 ha. for this purpose has begun, with land clearing, terracing, and
planting of 150 ha. of olive trees. Additional land will be prepared during
1988. Most of the site is available, more than enough for all expected
Tahtali resettlers, because the plan for the Ataturk resettlers overestimated
the number who would be willing to move from Eastern Turkey to the Izmir
Region. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Village Affairs will be
notified by DSI in 1988 of specific intentions of Tahtali resettlers,
following which approximately 1-1/2 years will be needed to complete
necessary construction and another six months will be spent in moving.
Financial support will be provided to families, typically for about a year
following the move, until income from farm production is restored. The
resettlement, as prescribed by law, also will provide for the continuation of
medical, educational, and other social services.
5.27     The sewage treatment plant site is uninhabite4 and will not involve
resettlement. Very minor displacements in the City may be necessary for land
acquisition for construction of pumping stations and storage tanks. Also
there may be minor temporary displacements for construction of the sewerage
collection system. The Government agreed in the Loan Negotiations that it
will furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1987, a detailed plan of action
satisfactory to the Bank for the resettlement of persons displaced as a
consequence of works carried out under the Project, and that it will carry
out the plan (Guarantee Agreement Section 3.01).

strial Wastewater Management
5.28     Approximately 200 industries contribute 50 percent of the pollution
of Izmir Bay. Two years ago, the Municipality established an Environmental
Division to bring under control and reduce untreated discharges.  The
Municipality has begun to require industries to invest in treatment
facilities, but the Environmental Division lacks adequate monitoring
capability. Also, it operates without adeqitate rules and regulations.
5.29     The Division was transferred to IZSU upon IZSU's formation.
Technical assistance is included in the Project to help to draft a sewer use
ordinance and design a monitoring and enforcement system; to train IZSU
personnel engaged in industrial waste management activities; to design a data
management sy6tem; to design special tariffs for sewerage service to
industries; to propose solutions for safe disposal of hazardous solid wastes;
and to establish a training program for operators of small treatment plants.
Establishment of a special fund to make low interest loans to industries for
constructing treatment facilities is not included in the Project since a
national fund for this purpose already exists. A description of the
Environmental Division's activities is included in the Project File.
5.30     Because the Project's sewage treatment facility is designed to
function using biological processes, its effectiveness can be reduced by
certain industrial wastes if they should enter the sewerage system without
adequate pretreatment. For this reason as well as the importance of
industrial wastes in polluting Izmir Bayg an effective industrial waste
management program is essential to the success of the sewerage component of
the Project. IZSU agreed in the Loan Negotiations on an Action Plan (Annex
10) to help ensure that an effective program would be prepared and carried out
(Loan Agreement Section 3.04).
ProJect-Related
5.31     Technical assistance would be provided for the establishment of a
permanent training unit and program in IZSU, and training of operators for the
sewage treatment plant, the water treatment plant and the sewage pumping
stations to be constructed under the Project. The training objective for
operators would be to ensure proper operation and maintenance of facilities to
be constructed under the Project. A long-term objective would be to ensure
the availability of trained personnel for IZSU after completion of the
Project. Establishment of the permanent unit and program is included in the
scope of work to be carried out by consultants for the institutional
strengthening of IZSU.
5.32     Operator training for most of the facilities to be constructed under
the Project would be carried out by consultants who would design and supervise
construction of the facilities, and who would have primary responsibility for
system start-up and operation for 12 months. Equipment suppliers and
specialists from established water supply and sewerage organizations in
developed countries also would be called upon to provide training. Key IZSU
personnel would be sent for one to three months training at overseas training



- 22 -
centers. The cost of project-related training is included in the cost
estimates under engineering services, technical assistance and equipment. The
amount estimated for this training is US$2.4 million. Terms-of-reference for
the establishment of a permanent training program and for operator training
are included in the Project File.
Procurement
5.33     Procurement arrangements are sunmarized in Table 5.3.  An estimated
88 percent of materials and equipment would be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines. The
The other 12 percent would be low cost items of operation and maintenance
equipment to be procured through international and local shopping (contracts
smaller than US$100,000), and materials and meters for service connections to
be procured under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures. '  An
estimated 40 percent of the civil works would be procured through ICB in
accordance with the World Bank Guidelines. The other 60 percent would be:
existing contracts which were procured under LCB; water distribution pipe
installation, tertiary sewer construction and sewer system rehabilitation
which would be procured under LCB; and service connection installation which
would be by IZSU's own personnel. The proposed loan would finance contracts
procured through ICB and cor.dultant contracts and other procurement using
international and local shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. LCB
contracts which would be financed in part by the Bank would be small contracts
for tertiary sewer construction and sewerage system rehabilitation.
L/ LOB procedures in-Turkey are generally consistent with the need for
economy and efficiency in the execution of the proposed Project.
There are, however, a few procedurtis which are inconsistent with the
Procurement Guidelines of the World Bank, and there are others which
require clarification. The Government and IZSU agreed in the Loan
Negotiations on the changes needed to make the procedures acceptable
to the Bank.

5.34     Project components already under contract include the Tahtali Dam and
Reservoir and sewage interceptor Sections 2, 3 and 4. World Bank financing
has not been requested for these existing civil works contracts, nor for water
distribution pipe installation and new water and sewer service connections.
New civil works contracts not to be financed by the Bank, about 25 percent of
the civil works total, would be procured using local competitive bidding
procedures, and would be too small to interest foreign bidders.
5.35     Contracts with an estimated aggregate value of US$113.3 million for
the supply of water distribution pipes, pumping station equipment, water
treatment plant equipment, PVC for sewer lining, large water meters, and 50
percent of the operating and maintenance equipment, are likely to be won by
foreign manufacturers since these items are not presently manufactured in
Turkey. Contracts for transmission main pipes, sewer pipes, water meters, and



- 24 -
the remaining 50 percent of the operation and maintenance equipment with an
estimated aggregate value of US$37.9 million are expected to be von by local
manufacturers. Qualifying local manufacturers would receive a preference in
bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the prevailing import duty,
whichever is less. Civil works contracts with an estimated value of US$216.2
million are likely to be won by local contractors, who, in recent years, have
been difficult to underbid in ICB procurements in Turkey. Consulting
contracts with an estimated total value of US$18.1 million are expected to be
won by foreign consultants in joint ventures with local consultants. The
remaining US$136.3 million of estimated project cost is for local salaries,
land acquisition and civil works already under contract.
5.36     Draft tender documents and proposed awards for equipment and materials
having an estimated contract value of more than US$500,000 equivalent and for
civil works having an estimated value of more than US$1,000,000 equivalent
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Contracts for lesser amounts
would be subject to ex-post review. These limits would result in prior review
of contracts representing about 70 percent of all procurement not yet under
contract.
Disbusements
5.37     Disbursements for components of the Project to be financed by the
proposed loanl' would be made for:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 27 percent of local
expenditures for civil works including concrete pipes
manufactured locally;
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and exfactory local
expenditures, and 65 percent of other local expenditures, for
materials, equipment, and pipes other than concrete;
(c) 100 percent for consultants and overseas training.
5.38     An initial disbursement estimated at US$1.0 million would be made to
repay the amount estimatLi to have been advanced to the Municipality from the
PPF for project preparation prior to Loan Agreement Effectiveness. The
proposed allocation of loan proceeds is shown in Annex 8. The Loan Closing
Date would be December 31, 1995, twelve months following scheduled project
completion. The disbursement profile period (Annex 9) from Board Approval
would be nine years.
5.39     Because of IZSU's lack of experience with procurements of the scope
and type (i.e., ICB) of the majority envisaged for the proposed project, IZSU
agreed in the Loan Negotiations that the establishment of a Special Account
for the disbursement of proceeds of the proposed loan would take place only
after appropriate project management specialists have been assigned to its
Project Management Unit (Loan Agreement Section 2.02(b); see also para. 3.06
of this report).
to Components not proposed to be financed by the Bank are the Tahtali Dam
and Reservoir (Part Al of the Project); Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
sewage interceptor (Part B2); service connections (Parts AS and B8);
and civil works for water distribution (Parts A3 and A4).

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.40     IZSU agreed in the Loan Negotiations to submit to the Bank
semi-annual reports (due February 28 and August 31) on the progress of project
implementation during the preceding semesters ending December 31 and June 30,
respectively. The reports would measure performance against the monitoring
indicators (Annex 11) and construction and procurement schedules (Annexes 6
and 7). Also IZSU would submit a Project Completion Report to the Bank six
months following the Loan Closing Date.
VL FINANCE
Past Peformace and Curent Financi Postion
6.01     Consolidated figures from accounts and estimates of IZSU's
predecessors (ESHOT and the Municipality Engineering Department) indicate a
negative return on operating assets in 1985; a return of less than 4 percent
in 1986; and minimal cash generation in these two years (Annexes 11, 12, and
13).    Local currency portions of the Municipality's investment expenditures
for the sector were met largely through budget provisions of Central
Government agencies and the Municipality. Foreign currency requirements were
met with a US$22 million equivalent loan from the Kuwait Fund, of which US$19
million were disbursed during the two years.
6.02     The lack of earnings is a consequence of relatively low user charges;
of water services to numerous hillside customers requiring costly pumping; and
of a relatively high proportion of unaccounted for water (para. 4.09).  The
average charge of approximately US$0.20-0.23 equivalent per cubic meter of
water sold during the two years was low by developing as well as developed
country standards, especially considering that no additional charge is imposed
for sewerage service (para. 6.12).
6.03     IZSU's balance sheet includes substantial receivables from and
payables to public agencies, accumulated by and inherited from ESHOT
(Annex 14). Approximately US$16.5 million equivalent is owed by IZSU to the
national power authority (TEK) for unpaid electricity in recent years. This
amounts to more than two years of consumption at present rates. Approximately
as$7.5 million equivalent for unpaid water is owed to IZSU by the Municipality
and its bus, trolley, and gas operations of ESHOT. Each of these accounts now
is being gradually reduced, and the Municipality and IZSU indicate that they
intend that the accounts should eventually reach reasonable levels. IZSU
agreed in the Loan Negotiations to prepare by end-1987 and thereafter carry
out a program acceptable to the Bank for the settlement of its public agency
accounts receivable and payable (Loan Agreement Section 5.05). As was noted
earlier (para. 3.13), IZSU's collection performance for household, commercial,
and industrial customers has been satisfactory.
6.04     Because of the lack of asset accounts and a fixed asset register for



- 26 -
IZSU's sewerage predecessor, the asset figures presented for IZSU sewerage are
estimates subject to revision once an appropriate inventory and valuation are
made. IZSU agreed in the Loan Negotiations to revalue its assets, and revise
its asset accounts accordingly by end 1988 (Loan Agreement Section 5.03[a]).
6.05     IZSU's debt to equity ratio, including IZSU's debt to TEK, is 41:59.
This is satisfactory because of lack of pressure with respect to the debt to
TEK (interest free and 40 percent of IZSU's total debt), and because of the
favorable terms of the debt to DSI (interest free, 30-year term, and 8 percent
of IZSU's total debt).
Finwb  Pim
6.06     IZSU's 1987-94 financial requirements consist of: (a) funds for the
proposed project; (b) funds for other work in progress to be completed in
1988; (c) funds for the first three years of a major second stage of
investment, not part of the proposed project, to begin in 1992 and continue
through 1997; (d) debt service; and (e) increases in working capital. IZSU
plans that approximately 36 percent of the estimated US$786 million equivalent
needed would be generated within the sector through charges to customers; 18
percent would be direct appropriations from the Municipal budget; and 10
percent and 6 percent, respectively, would be provided by Iller Bank and DSI.
The balance would be obtained through foreign borrowings, principally the
proposed loan of US$184 million equivalent from the World Bank, and future
foreign credit to be used beginning in 1992. The plan may be summarized as
follows:

6.07     Direct annual budget contributions from the Municipality (making up
its eight-year direct contribution of US$142 million equivalent) would be at
their largest, approximately US$24 million each, in the first two years, 1987
and 1988. Commitments at this level represent approximately one third of the
Municipality's total investment budget, the proportion devoted to the sector
by the Municipality in 1985 and 1986. The Municipality intends that the
contributions should be equity.
6.08     The expenditures by DSI estimated at approximately US$49.7 million
equivalent for the Tahtali dam and Reservoir and for local costs of other
Tahtali works are to be funded through annual budget provisions of DSI. Upon
completion of the Tahtali works, those works other than the dam and reservoir
will be transferred to IZSU for operation. Upon the transfer, IZSU will incur
debt to DSI in the amount of DSI's total expenditure for those transferred
works. The terms of the debt of IZSU to DSI will be those terms defined by
law as the standard DSI terms at the time of the transfer. (At present, DSI
terms for debt of this kind are 30 years at zero interest.) The dam and
reservoir will be retained and operated by DSI at no cost to IZSU. The
expenditures by Iller Bank estimated at approximately US$77.3 million
equivalent for sewerage interceptor Sections 2, 3 and 4 will be funded through
loans from Iller Bank to the Municipality. A separate loan will be made each
year for the expenditures during that year. The terms of each loan will be
those terms defined by law as the standard Iller Bank terms at the time of
the loan. (At present, Iller Bank terms for debt of this kind are five years
at annual interest of 301.) Upon completion, the works will be transferred to
IZSU ownership at no cost to IZSU. The debt to Iller Bank will be serviced by
the Municipality.
Future Finances
6.09     The projected cash generation in IZSU's financing plan is based on
planned increases of IZSU's tariffs 10 percent in real terms semi-annually
starting in July 1987 and continuing through mid-1990 (Annex 12). The
semi-annual increases would by mid-1990 result in a cumulative increase of 95
percent in real terms, giving tariffs averaging about TL 345 (at January 1987
price levels) compared to today's average of TL 177. The plan would then
maintain this level in real terms, although, as noted elsewhere (para. 7.15),
further increases might be justified to approach marginal cost.
6.10     With the planned tariffs, IZSU's projected increase in self-financing
(i.e., financing of its investment expenditures with cash generation from
customers after fully covering cash operating expenses and debt service) would
grow during the next four years to a level in the range of 30 percent
(calculated as a two-year moving average1'; Annex 13). IZSU agreed in the
Loan Negotiations to produce funds from internal sources by which its
self-financing of investments, including the investments being executed for it
by Iller Bank and DSI, would be assured, at a minimum, at the levels projected
lo The ratio of the total net internal cash generation in the current
year and the preceding year to the total of the investment
expenditures in the two years.



- 28 -
(i.e., two-year moving averages of 6 percent, 7 percent, 11 percent, and 19
percent, respectively, in 1987 through 1990, and 30 percent thereafter; Loan
Agreement Section 5.02(aJ). IZSU agreed, in addition: (i) to review before
May 1 and November 1 in each year the adequacy of its tariffs to produce the
revenue required; and (ii) to promptly make the adjustments needed should any
review indicate that IZSU would not otherwise obtain sufficient revenue (Loan
Agreement Sections 5.021b] and tc]).
6.11     The investment program, borrowing and operating expenditures
projected for IZSU have been balanced to allow for adequate maintenance of
existing facilities as well as needed expansion of service. IZSU's future
debt service coverage ratio (Annex 13) is expected to be 2.0 or above for the
next five years, until principal payments would begin for debt to the World
Bank, at which point the ratio would drop to 1.6. This would be satisfactory,
and increases from 1.6 are projected for subsequent years. IZSU, however,
agreed in the Loan Negotiations to consult with the Bank with respect to any
long term borrowing which it would contract for purposes other than the
Project which would aggregate to more than US$2 million equivalent in any
year. It agreed also to consult with the Bank with respect to any investment
not included in the Project which would aggregate to more than US$2 million
equivalent in any year (Loan Agreement Section 3.04).
Tariff Struture and Adluatments
6.12     IZSU's tariffs are the same for customers receiving both water and
sewerage service as those for customers receiving water only:
Percentage
Customer                                     Rate          of Total

a/ For metered water consumption; all legal connections are metered.
The importance of the inequity between the sewered and the unsewered customers
will, however, become minimal during the next three years.  During this time,
the total number of sewer connections will approach the number of water
connections, under the Municipality policy calling, in principle, for sewering
every IZSU water customer.
6.13     A significant opportunity for improvement in the tariff structure is
the 20m3/month limit between the two blocks for household customers. With
this dividing point, approximately three quarters of the total water
consumption of the Municipality is being sold at the lowest rate, while less
than 10 percent of the total is being consumed by customers (mainly low income
households) who, on average, use less than 7-8m' per month.



- 29 -
6.14     It will become especially important to modify the structure as tariff
increases are introduced, so as to maintain an appropriate concessional rate
for low income consumers. 12SU agreed in the Loan Negotiations to complete a
tariff study by June 30, 1988, and, after consultation with the Bank on the
study's recommendations, introduce appropriate modifications to the structure
by end-1988 (Loan Agreement Section 5.03[bl).
F ial RePo
6.15     IZSU agreed in the Loan Negotiations to provide to the Bank
semi-annual financial reports (Loan Agreement Section 3.05). The reports
would forecast and identify as early as possible significant variations from
planned expenditures and financial performance objectives so that appropriate
action may be taken. The reports would be provided at the same times as the
reports on project implementation (para. 5.40).
VIL PROJECT BENEFTrS
Proiect Benefits
7.01     The Project would provide piped water facilities for approximately
0.84 million people, and sewerage for 1.17 million people by 1994. It would
contribute to a,more reliable water supply for 0.8 million people presently
served, through equipment for improved operation and maintenance and the
rehabilitation of the existing water and sewerage networks. At present, these
people experience low water pressure and intermittent service. The Project
would also improve water supply to industrial and commercial enterprises,
thereby improving their productivity. An additional benefit would be a saving
of US$4.5 million per year in operating costs and delayed capital investment
due to a reduction of unaccounted-for water.
7.02     There would be other benefits which are difficult to quantify.
Financial strengthening of IZSU would reduce reliance on outside sources for
financing future investments, and management strengthening and training would
increase cost-effectiveness and reduce the need for costly technical
assistance. Reduction of pollution in Izmir Bay through sewage treatment and
control of industrial effluent would increase land values along the
shore-front, and generate new comercial and recreational activities. It
would improve the quality of life for the inhabitants of Izmir, permitting
them to benefit from an amenity which has been of limited use in recent years,
and would improve the tourist industry.
7.03     Deferral of the Project would entail increased expenditures by
households and industries obliged to take measures to alleviate water
shortages and inadequate waste disposal. These measures would include
construction of water storage tanks above dwellings, drilling of private
wells, and construction of septic tanks (some in areas unsuitable for these
structures). Deferral of the Project would also result in the use of unsafe
sources of water by some consumers.
7.04     The Project would have significant, though difficult to quantify,
health benefits, particularly amongst lower-income groups which have not
previously had access to sufficient clean water or water borne sewage



- 30 -
disposal. Recorded working days lost to illness from water-borne diseases in
Ismir increased through the late 1970'3 from about 25,000 man/days per year to
40,000 man/days per year. Without the Project, the increase would be likely
to continue; with it, there should be a decline.
Re-use of Effluent for Akiculture
7.05     Approximately 290 million cubic meters of treated sewage effluent per
year are expected to be produced by 1995, and 480 million cubic meters by
2015. This would be sufficient to irrigate 21,000 ha by 1995, and 35,000 ha
by 2015. The treatment plant site would be located 20 km from the Gediz River
valley, an area extensively irrigated with water from the Gediz River, which
is regulated by Marmara Lake and the Demirkoyru Reservoir about 100 km east of
Ismir. The average annual flow in the Gediz River is 830 million cubic
meters. In the future, as Izmir's water needs continue to expand, some of the
Gediz River flow might be taken for drinking water for the City. The City's
effluent could replace this for irrigation down-river if necessary; or the
effluent could be used to expand irrigation beyond the limits of the Gediz's
present capacity. IZSU intends to undertake a study to investigate the
possibilities.
Envomental Impact
7.06     The environmental impact of the Project would be positive.  As
already mentioned, pollution of the Bay of Izmir would be reduced by the
collection and treatment of the City's sewage, at present discharged untreated
into the Bay. Contamination of the water distribution network due to low
system pressures allowing wastewater infiltration would be eliminated by the
rehabilitation program; and incidence of water-borne diseases would be reduced.
Affrdbiltyof Projeet Service
7.07     In the 1978 household expenditure survey for Izmir, the last known to
have been conducted, mean household income was determined to be approximately
TL 13,200. Assuming that incomes in Izmir have followed the national trend (a
conservative assumption, since the Izmir economy has been more dynamic than
the Turkish economy as a whole), mean household income at the end of 1986
would be TL 144,000.-'' Assuming monthly household water consumption of
approximately 17.8 m3 (150 l/c/d and an average household size of 3.9), the
projected average tariff of TL 385/m3 (TL 345/m3 plus the 121 VAT) combined
with the present tariff structure-t' would imply an average monthly household
expenditure of TL 5,410, approximately 3.8S of average household income.
7.08     The above analysis does not, however, take into account any revision
to the current structure of tariffs. The advantages of a more appropriate
block structure may be illustrated by taking the example of Istanbul, which
has recently revised its structure while increasing tariffs to an average of
TL 575/m3, 601 more than the average currently projected for Izmir. If the
This assumes that household incomes have increased at the same rate as
nominal wages since 1978, i.e. by a factor of 10.9.
See para 6.12 for present rates and structure.  The projected average
rate of TL 345/m3 would imply a tariff of TL 272/m3 for households
consuming 0-20 m3/month; TL 409 for households above 20 m3/month; and
TL 624 for industrial and commercial users.



- 31 -
Istanbul tariff structure and level were adopted in Izmir,1' monthly
household expenditures on water and sewerage in Izmir would average only
TL 6,930, 4.8X rather than 3.82 of household income. Revenues to IZSU,
however, would be increased by nearly 602, and the finances of the
organization greatly strengthened. If the Istanbul structure were introduced,
but the average proposed tariff of TL 3451m3 retained, household monthly
expenditure on water and sewerage would be only TL 4,090, 2.82 of household
income. This indicates that there is substantial scope for increasing tariffs
in Izmir,provided that this is combined with a revision to the block tariff
structure. '
7.09     The argument for introducing block tariffs with the Istanbul
structure is strengthened if the impact of the proposed tariff increase on the
lowest income groups is considered. The most recent estimate of the 'absolute
poverty' urban income level is US$340 per capita per year, or a monthly
household income of TL 82,000. Assuming that income distribution has not
changed since the 1978 census, approximately 302 of the population of Izmir
would be living at or below the poverty level, with a median monthly household
income of TL 60,000. Assuming these lower income households consume an
average of 8m3 of water per month and that the Istanbul tariffs and block
tariff system were introduced, the average monthly household expenditure on
water and sanitation would be only TL 1,912 or 3% of household income.
Eof"I mp
7.10     A total of 0.84 million people would receive piped water under the
Project, and 1.17 million sewerage. Household water connections will be
provided to about 280,000 people who are today without piped water. Of these,
at least 802, or 225,000 persons are estimated to have incomes below the
poverty threshold. Similarly public sewerage would be provided to about
750,000 persons without this service. About 752 of these, or 560,000 persons
are estimated to be living in poverty.
7.11     The majority of the new water and sewerage connections under the
Project, however, and thus the bulk of the increased production, treatment and
distribution capacity provided under the Project, would be provided to
maintain service levels for the increasing population of the City. The total
population is expected to increase by 760,000 over the project period. Of
these, about 560,000 people would be proviJed with water and 400,000 with
sewerage connections. Given that about half of this population increase would
be made up of immigration, mostly from poorer rural areas, it is estimated
that at least half of all these beneficiaries, or 230,000 persons receiving
water and 200,000 rprsons receiving sewerage, would have incomes below the
poverty threshold. /
L'  Domestic water and sewerage tariff of TL 225/m3 for the first 7.5 m3;
TL 450/m3 thereafter; higher tariffs for commercial and industrial
users.
to It should be noted that these discussions assume no increase in real
incomes over the project period. If real incomes increase, the
proportion of income spent on water and sewerage would, of course,
decrease correspondingly.
On the assumption that half of the city's population increase
(380,000) is made up of natural increase, whose social structure
reflects that of the city (302 poor), and half of immigration, of whom
652 would be poor.



- 32 -
7.12     In summary, about 55% of the beneficiaries receiving water supply
(455,000 people) and 651 of the beneficiaries receiving sewerage (760,000
people) would have incomes below the poverty threshold. A further 800,000
inhabitants of the existing population for whom current services are inadequat4.
would have their services improved by the rehabilitation component. Their
income structure is likely to reflect that of the city as a whole.
Rate of Return
7.13     Quantification of the envirosmental and health benefits of the
project was not possible.  Incremental water sales due to the Project are,
therefore, taken as a minimum indication of benefits. Capital and operating
cost streams and revenues, excluding taxes and duties, are indicated in
Annex 15 at prices of January, 1987.  It has also been assumed that without
the rehabilitation component of the Project, as operation and maintenance
problems and water losses increase, there would be a gradual decline in water
sales of about 32 per year. Based on this assumption and a gradual tariff
increase to TL 345/m3 by 1990, the internal rate-of-return of the Project
would be 6X. Sensitivity tests were carried out to test the IRR under less
favorable conditions. If operating costs increase by 10%, the IRR is reduced
to 5.51; if sales are reduced by 101 the IRR is 4.41; and if capital costs
increase by 101 it is 5.31. None of these possibilities is, however,
considered likely. Furthermore, if costs rise more rapidly than anticipated,
this may be compensated for by upward tariff adjustment.
7.14     As indicated above, the projected tariff is well below the tariffs
recently adopted for Istanbul, and the current tariff structure does not
maximize the goal of revenue maximization with affordability of adequate
service to all income groups. In addition, environment and health benefits
are excluded. The projected tariffs therefore under-estimate the Project's
benefits. The return of the Project was recalculated assuming that the
current Istanbul tariffs are introduced for Izmir; the IRR increased
substantially, to over 151. The long run average incremental cost of water,
discounted at 101 is estimated at TL 440/m3, well in excess of the tariff of
TL 345/m3 taken as an objective for 1990. This suggests that further tariff
increases could be appropriate to permit IZSU to finance an increasing
proportion of future investments from internal cash generation.
Leat-Cost Soluton
7.15     The proposed project constitutes the least-cost solution for meeting
Izmir's growing water and sewerage needs. Regarding sewerage, separation of
storm drainage from sanitary flows was considered and rejected, given the
existing network of city sewers and the cost.1' The selected sewage
treatment alternative is the least-cost treatment solution both on first-cost
and annual cost bases. It is also the alternative with the highest
reliability and ease of operation, and the lowest energy requirement.
Construction of the Tahtali Dam and Reservoir was found to be the least-cost
next step alternative for meeting the Municipality's water supply requirements
after 1991.
As noted earlier (para. 5.13), the capacity of the interceptor is,
however, set for dry weather flow, and excess flows during storms
will go to the Bay through overflow structures at collector
junctions with the interceptor.



- 33 -
7.16    Actions are underway to overcome the main obstacles to project
Implementation. These include implementation of appropriate design and
construction standards for the sewage interceptor sections currently under
construction (para. 5.20); the acquisition of land for the sewage treatment
plant (para. 5.24); and the creation of IZSU (para. 3.01). In addition, the
Tabtali Dam will be given special inspections to ensure that it meets
appropriate safety standards (para. 5.19). Finally, a program is being
established for the treatment of industrial wastes and the control of
industrial discharges to the sewerage system, thereby ensuring effective
performance of the sewage treatment plant and maintaining acceptable effluent
standards (para. 5.30).
VIIL AGREEMETrS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     During the Loan Negotiations, IZSU agreed that it would:

REPUBLIC OF TlRKEY
IZMIR WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Proiect Cost Estimates
1.            Summary cost estimates by expenditure category, year and
financing source are included in Tables A5.1 through A5.4 of this Annex.
Detailed estimates are included in the Project File. All cost estimates were
prepared using January 1986 prices. The base costs are presented in January
1987 prices, updated from the original estimates to account for 1986
inflation. The updated estimates reflect an exchange rate o} TL 744 to 1.
The exchange rate for the original estimates was TL 575 to 1.
2.            Cost estimates for the Tahtali Dam and Interceptor Sections 2, 3
and 4 are based on the contract prices for these items increased by inflation.
Civil works costs are based on preliminary quantity estimates and unit prices
of similar work in Turkey and other countries in the Region. Pipe, equipment
and material costs are based on supplier quotations and recent bid prices where
available. Land cost estimates were prepared by the Municipality's land office
based on the cost of similar land in Izmir.
3.            The cost of consultants for project coordination, design,
construction supervision, and technical assistance are based on man-month
estimates and rates charged by foreign and local consultants in Turkey. Local
staff costs are based on man-month estimates and current salaries paid by the
Municipality.
4.            Value added taxes on local equipment, materials and services are
reflected in the local cost component of the affected components. Import
duties are not included since IZSU is exempt.
5.            Physical contingencies are 0 percent for consultants, staff
salaries and land and 10 percent for equipment, materials and civil works.
