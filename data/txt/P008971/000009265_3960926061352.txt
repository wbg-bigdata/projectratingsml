MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNFDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE DNTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT OF THE
MUNICIPALlTY OF IZMR IN TNE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.         The following report on a proposed loan of US$184.0 million
equivalent to the Izmir Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate, IZSU,
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for a term of seventeen
years, including four years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, and would help finance a water supply and sewerage project.
2.         Background.   The Project is located in Izmir, the third largest
city in Turkey. Izmir is an important industrial center, and 402 of the
Nation's exports pass through its port. Its population of 1.7 million is
growing at 5 per year. About 802 of the population have water connections,
but only two-thirds of these have adequate supply. Only 60S of the population
is connected to the sewerage system. The system discharges untreated sewage
and industrial wastes directly into Izmir bay, around which the city is
situated, and into surface channels and streams flowing through the city to
the bay. This has caused severe pollution within the city and in the bay, and
has created significant health hazards.
3.         In addition to service deficiencies and pollution, there have been
institutional and financial deficiencies. Responsibilities for developing new
water and sewerage facilities for the area have been divided among the
Municipel Administration and two Central Government agencies, none of which
has had sufficient finances to address more than a small fraction of its
objective. Water and sewerage operating responsibilities in the Municipality
have been divided among separate branches of the Municipal Administration
which carry out a variety of other functions as well. Charges for water and
sewerage services have been low compared to costs and to financial
requirements for future development. Maintenance, quality of service, and the
pace of development have suffered as a consequence.
4.         To counter these problems, which are common also in other
communities in Turkey and not. just in Izmir, the Central Government has
established a water supply and sewerage strategy for urban areas: (i) to begin
shifting responsibilities for sector development from Central Government
agencies to municipalities; (ii) to create separate, autonomous municipal
authorities; and (iii) to improve cost recovery and reduce local financial
dependence on Central Government resources. The strategy proved to be
successful in Istanbul, and Izmir is now embracing it in the proposed project.
5.         Prolect Obiectives.   The Project would promote better
environmental conditions in Izmir through adequate water supply, sewerage, and
sewage treatment facilities, and the establishment of appropriate industrial
waste treatment policies and practices. These actions would reduce health
hazards and bring about major environmental improvements and economic
benefits. The Project would help to strengthen institutional and financial
aspects of the sector in Izmir following the approach taken in the Istanbul
Sewerage Project (Loan 2159-TU). This has begun with the establishment in
Izmir of the separate, autonomous water supply and sewerage organization,
IZSU, using as a model the highly successful organization, ISKI, which was



established in Istanbul. In addition, the Project will correct deficiencies
in the existing water and sewerage systems in Izmir, and will provide training
which will improve maintenance and promote more efficient operation.
6.         Proiect Description.   The Project, to be carried out over a
nine-year period, would help to strengthen the newly established water supply
and sewerage entity, IZSU, particularly its operation, maintenance, and
administrative capabilities, through technical assistance and training
components. These components would also focus on improved control of
unaccounted-for water and monitoring and control of industrial waste
discharges. Physical improvements of the water and sewerage systems would
include; Water SupDlY - completion of the construction of the Tahtali Dam and
Reservoir; construction for the Tahtali system of an intake, water treatment
plant, treated water storage, pumping station, water transmission main, and a
terminal storage reservoir; expansion, reinforcement and rehabilitation of the
water distribution network (including the provision of meters and service
connections);  Sewerage - construction of a sewage interceptor, a sewage
treatment plant, seven pumping stations and asRociated force mains, sewage
collectors, secondary and tertiary sewers, and property connections.
7.         The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$521.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$225.4 million equivalent
(43X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status oi Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6656-TU dated May 1, 1987 is being distributed separately.
8.         Rationale for World Bank Involvement.   The proposed loan would
support the Government's strategy of promoting the development of self
sustaining local institutions in the water supply and sewerage sector. The
principal objectives for Izmir would be to strengthen the local sector
institution; to have it adopt appropriate financial policies; and to have it
establish acceptable methods for treatment and disposal of industrial wastes
and provide adequate water supply and sewerage facilities to reduce health
hazards and bring about economic benefits and environmental improvement. This
is in line with the Bank's strategy to assist in reinforcing changes toward
more efficient water supply and waste disposal, environmental and health
improvements, the adoption of a full cost recovery policy, and the
introduction of institutional reforms. The loan would support the Bank's
strategy of promoting autonomous water supply and sewerage authorities in
Turkey's larger municipalities. It would help to insure that IZSU, the new
agency formed with the Project, would receive the assistance and support it
needs to implement appropriate tariff policies, sound financial planning,
least-cost solutions, control of unaccounted-for water, monitoring and control
of industrial wastes, and effective maintenance.
9.         Agreed Actions.   Agreements have been reached that IZSU would:
(a)   prepare and carry out an action plan with agreed dates from 1988 to
1991 for the treatment of industrial wastes and the control of
industrial discharges to the sewerage system and Izmir bay;
(b)   after a tariff study and consultation with the Bank, introduce by
the end of 1988 a tariff structure which would encourage
conservation while ensuring that a reasonable level of service
remains affordable to low income consumers;



- 3 -
(c)   achieve self-financing of at least 302 of investments by 1991; and
(d)   complete by December 31, 1988 the acquisition of the land needed for
sewage treatment plant construction, and request disbursements for
major sewerage works only after completing the land acquisition.
In addition, agreements have been reached that the Government would:
(a)   provide to the Bank by December 31, 1987, a detailed plan of action
satisfactory to the Bank for the resettlement of persons displaced
by the Project; and
(b)   have the Tahtali Dam inspected during and after its construction to
ensure that it meets appropriate safety standards.
10.       Justification.   The Project would help to build up a strong sector
organization, and, through the organization, would provide piped water
facilities for approximately 0.84 million people, and sewerage for 1.17
million people by 1994. It would contribute to more reliable supply for 0.8
million people presently served, through improved operation and maintenance
and the rehabilitation of the existing water and sewerage networks. The
Project would also improve supply to industrial and commercial enterprises,
thereby contributing to improving their productivity. An additional benefit
would be a saving of US$4.5 million per year in operating costs and delayed
capital investment resulting from reductions in leakage and waste.
11.       Financial strengthening of IZSU through revenue increases would
reduce reliance on outside sources for financing future investments.
Management strengthening and training would increase cost-effectiveness.
Reduction of pollution in Izmir bay through industrial waste control and
sewage treatment would increase land values along the shore-front, and help to
generate new commercial and recreational activities. The Project also would
have significant health benefits, particularly among lower-income groups which
have not previously had access to sufficient safe water and water-borne sewage
disposal.
12.       Risks.   The Project's main risks are: (i) the possibility of
reduction in the effectiveness of the sewage treatment process, which is
biological, because of a failure by the authorities to obtain adequate
pretreatment of certain kinds of industrial discharges before they are allowed
to enter the sewerage system; and (ii) the possibility of failure of the
Tahtali Dam (which is located in a seismically active region). The first
possibility will be minimized by adopting and enforcing appropriate waste
control policy. The second possibility can be virtually eliminated since the
works will be implemented by DSI, an experienced and capable entity in works
of this nature, using appropriate design and construction standards subject to
rigorous inspection.
13.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
