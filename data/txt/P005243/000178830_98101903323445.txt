JORDAN
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the first project in the transport sector
of Jordan proposed for Bank Group assistance. The project includes: con-
struction of the new four-lane highway between Amman and Zarqa (18 km),
including supervision by consultants; purchases of road maintenance equip-
ment; technical assistance, if needed, to the Ministry of Public Works; and
an urban transportation study of Amman.
ii.       The Amman-Zarqa road links the country's two largest population
centers east of the Jordan River. After the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the
population of these two cities and of the corridor between them expanded
rapidly due to a large influx of refugees from the territory west of the
river. The resulting increase in traffic, coupled with unplanned ribbon
development, has brought the existing road to its capacity much earlier
than had been foreseen. Construction of a new highway is clearly of high
priority. Investment in this new road is expected to yield a rate of re-
turn of 17%.
iii.      In Zarqa the new road will terminate in a four-lane city street,
with sufficient capacity to handle the forecast traffic.  At the Amman
end, the Municipality proposes a four-lane limited access extension of
the new road to an intersection in the center of Amman where better traffic
distribution can be obtained. However, some urban planning aspects of this
proposal require further investigation. On the basis of available data,
the capacity of the six-lane city street, to which the new road will be
initially connected, will be reached about 1978, when additional facilities
will be required. In the interim,the requisite planning studies can be
made and, on the basis of their findings, construction of the most suitable
solution for traffic distribution should be undertaken.
iv.       The mechanical equipment and the possible technical assistance
included in the project will help the Government improve the standard of
road maintenance in the country, at present considered as only fair. By
increasing the effectiveness of personnel and equipment, improvements in
maintenance services can be made without significantly increasing mainte-
nance expenditures.
v.        The total project cost, including contingencies, is US$8.7 mil-
lion, including a foreign exchange component of US$6.0 million to be fi-
nanced by the Association. The award of the construction contract and the
procurement of mechanical equipment will be based on international competi-
tive bidding. Construction supervision and the other expert services will
be carried out by consultants. The Ministry of Public Works will be respon-
sible for execution of the road project.



- {i -
vi.        The cost of the construction element of the project is based on
actual bids received April 24, 1971 and this element accounts for about 80%
of the total cost. The overall rate of return for the project will be very
close to the 17% calculated for the Ahten-Zarqa road. It constitutes a
suitable basis fGr an IDA credit of US$6.0 million equivalent to, the Gov-
ernmen-t of Jordan on the usual terms.



JORDAN
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Jordan has requested a credit from the Associa-
tion to finance a highway project consisting of: (a) construction of a new
four-lane highway between Amman and Zarqa (18 km), including supervision by
consultants; (b) purchases of road maintenance equipment identified by con-
sultants; (c) technical assistance, if needed, to the Ministry of Public
Works for improving administration and methods of road maintenance; and
(d) an urban transportation study, by consultants, to determine the best
solution for distributing traffic from the project road into downtown Am-
man.
1.02      This is the Bank Group's first project in Jordan's transport sec-
tor.  The highway selected for construction by the Government is clearly of
high priority in the sector, serving two of the largest population centers
on the territories east of the Jordan River (East Bank). The need for ad-
ditional road capacity in the corridor between these two centers has been
accelerated by the rapid expansion of the area's population and the steep
growth in traffic volumes after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
1.03      The United States Agency for International Development (US A.I.D.)
is financing a road maintenance study by a United States consultant, Miller-
Warden-Western/Frederic Harris, presently engaged on other US A.I.D.-spon-
sored work in Jordan. The results of this study are expected early in
1972, and the Government assured the Association that it will implement the
study's agreed findings.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs.. R. Mulligan (Engineer) and
H. Schlechtriem (Economist) on the basis of a preappraisal mission to Jordan
in October 1969, followed by an appraisal mission in April/May 1970. It
was edited by Mrs. P. Valad.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, with an area of about 97,000 km2
(38,000 sq mi), is about the size of Portugal or the State of Virginia.
Except for a short coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba, it is landlocked; its
neighbors are Syria on the north, Iraq on the northeast, and Saudi Arabia
on the east and south. A 600 km truce line separates it from the State of
Israel on the west. Jordan's total population is 2.3 million, including
about 900,000 refugees, and it is increasing about 3% p.a.



- 2 -
2.02      Natural resources are scarce, therefore, Jordan relies heavily on
foreign trade and assistance. Only about 7% of its area is cultivated and
the remainder is arid. A small part of this productive area is irrigated,
but for the most part agriculture (vegetables, fruits, wheat, and olives)
depends on rainfall. Two phosphate mines, a petroleum refinery, a cement
plant, and a variety of small factories producing consumer goods form the
industrial sector. Various sites of historical and religious interest,
and, to a lesser extent, some recreational resorts are the basis of the
country's tourist industry.
2.03      Supported by foreign assistance, the economy grew at almost 10%
p.a. up to 1967 when per capita income reached a level of JD 93 (US$260
equivalent). The June 1967 Arab-Israeli War, which resulted in the occupa-
tion by Israel of the territories west of the Jordan River (West Bank), the
influx of new refugees from the West to the East Bank, and the closure of
the Suez Canal, disrupted this promising development. The subsequent process
of recovery and adaptation to the changed situation on the East Bank was
interrupted by the September 1970 Civil War, which again brought the economy
to a standstill. Before the Civil War, per capita income of the 1.4 million
Jordanians living on the East Bank was about JD 75 (US$200 equivalent).
Future economic development depends to a great extent on the settlement of
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
B.  Transportation
(a) General
2.04      The major centers of population and domestic production are rela-
tively close to each other (Map) and, therefore, only limited domestic
transportation is required. The situation is quite different for imports
and exports, which generally have to be transported long distances. Jordan's
only access to the sea, the port of Aqaba on an arm of the Red Sea, is some
300 km south of Amman.  Since the Suez Canal has been closed, most trade
with western countries has been through Beirut (Lebanon), about an equal
distance north of Amman through Syria. The transport needs are, in general,
adequately served by a comprehensive network of national and feeder roads
and also, to a limited extent, by the railroad. Air transport is significant
only for international passenger traffic. Road transport is by far the domi-
nant mode for both goods and passengers.
(b) Highways
2.05      At the end of 1969, Jordan's highway network comprised about
2,800 km; in 1968, the last year for which data are available, the motor
vehicle fleet numbered some 25,900 units, of which 15,200 were private
passenger cars and taxis. Details of the highway sector are given in
Chapter 3.



-3-
(c) Railroads
2.06      Jordan's railroad was built in the early years of this century as
part of the Turkishl Hedjaz railroad, which connected Damascus (Syria) with
Medina (Saudi Arabia) before it was partially destroyed in World War I. Now,
366 km of 1.05 m gauge track are in operation by Jordan, linking Dera'a at
the Syrian border via Amman to Ras en Naqb, 70 km north of the Port of Aqaba.
Traffic on the northern link was about 100,000 m tons in 1969, the major com-
modity being phosphate from Ruseifa which was diverted from Aqaba to Beirut.
The volume of exports that can be carried on this route is fixed by inter-
national agreement because of the limited capacity of the "rack-railroad"
in Lebanon. 1/ Also in 1969, about 16,000 passengers traveled on the
northern link between Amman and Damascus. Traffic on the southern link
fell from about 100,000 m tons in 1966 to 36,000 m tons (mainly Government
goods) in 1969. Revenues from traffic declined from JD 159,000 (US$445,000)
in 1966 to JD 94,000 (US$263,000) in 1969; the railroad is understood to re-
ceive an annual Government subsidy of about JD 50,000 (US$140,000).
2.07      Two major railroad developments now are underway.  Following a
1963 agreement between Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, the Hedjaz railroad
to Medina is being rebuilt. Works on the Ma'an-Mudawwara section in Jordan
were recently completed, but those on the section in Saudi Arabia are tem-
porarily halted. The main purpose of this new railroad will be to handle
part of the 500,000 pilgrims to and from Mecca each year during the two-month
pilgrimage season. Since a new road parallel to this railroad is now under
construction, the railroad will probably have serious competition as soon
as it opens. The second development is the construction of a 142 km branch
line from Hattiya (between Ma'an and the Saudi border) to Aqaba, for which
West German financial assistance is expected. It is planned that the new
line will be operated by a separate organization (the Aqaba Railroad Author-
ity), and will cater mainly to phosphate exports, now carried by road from
El Hassa. The project was fully prepared for implementation, but the 1967
events drastically changed the traffic expectations for this link. The Gov-
ernment has decided to have consultants reassess the feasibility of the proj-
ect before undertaking construction.
(d) Ports and Shipping
2.08      In 1966 the Port of Aqaba reached its highest traffic -- about
600,000 m tons of exports and imports. The closure of the Suez Canal had
the greatest effect on import volumes, which dropped to 160,000 m tons in
1968. The volume of exports, mainly phosphate, continued to rise slowly,
largely because of the Government's policy of fostering trade with Asian
countries. The port capacity of 800,000 m tons p.a. for general cargo and
over 2 million m tons for phosphate, now is not fully used, and even under
normal conditions would be adequate for many years.
1/   The Chemin de Fer du Liban uses rack and pioion (cog wheel) to surmount
the mountain range between Damascus and Beirut.



-4-
(e) Air Transport
2.09      In 1966, before the Arab-Israeli War, Jordan's two main airports,
Amman and Jerusalem (90 km apart), handled a total volume of 340,000 pas-
senger movements. An airport feasibility study for the entire country was
carried out by the Batelle Memorial Institute (United States) in 1966/67.
In view of the rapid increase in air travel and with particular regard to
the requirements of tourist traffic, the study recommended, among other
things, a new international airport near Jericho in the western Jordan val-
ley and a small airport at Aqaba. The Jericho proposal is no longer practic-
able, but the Aqaba project is under construction with British financial
assistance. The events of 1967 have had little effect on traffic at Amman
airport, where the volume of passenger movements continued to increase from
about 137,000 in 1966 to 176,000 in 1968, and some improvements would prob-
ably be justified. However, the Government now proposes to construct the
first stage of a new airport 30 km south of the capital, reportedly to
better accomodate two Boeing 707 aircraft which are being added to the
national airline (ALIA) fleet.
(f) Pipelines
2.10      Two pipelines pass through Jordan:  the Iraq Petroleum Company
(IPC) line and the Trans-Arabian Pipeline (TAP). The former was shut down
in 1949 and abandoned in 1964. The TAP is considered as an external facil-
ity and not a part of Jordan's transport system, although it is the source
of crude oil for the Jordan Refinery.
C.   Transport Planning and Coordination
2.11      The responsibility for administering the transport system is
divided between two Ministries: the Ministry of Public Works, responsible
for the national road network and, recently, also for the village or
feeder road network; and the Ministry of Transport responsible for railroads,
Aqaba port, and aviation. Investments in transport, as in other sectors,
are coordinated by the Jordan Development Board (JDB). The most recent
planning document is the Seven-Year Program for Economic Development of
Jordan (1964-1970), which allocated 23% of total public investments (JD 145.7
million or US$408 million) to transport. The major objectives in the trans-
port sector were to promote exports by reduced transport costs on improved
road, rail, and port facilities and to improve airport facilities so as not
to hamper the growth of tourism. Feasibility studies have been made of the
projects and it appears that most were well-conceived and economically
viable; an exception might be reconstruction of the Hedjaz railroad (para.
2.07), which is religiously motivated.
2.12      The events of 1967 have changed the scene from that existing at
the beginning of the plan. Some investments made in its early years cannot
be utilized fully, e.g., the expansion of port facilities in Aqaba; others
have been suspended, e.g., construction of the Aqaba-Safi road, which was



- 5 -
halted when 25% complete because of hostilities in the area. Scill other
investment plans, particularly those concerning tourism development, have
had to be reconceived, and new needs have suddenly arisen, e.g., the pro-
posed Amman-Zarqa road construction, which is the main element of this proj-
ect. A new plan is needed to meet the requirements of the changed situation,
but under present conditions the Government intends to proceed with short-
term planning.
2.13      Planning in Jordan is generally adequate, but some problems exist
in project evaluation and selection. The staff at a working level in the
JDB are not fully capable of supervising, coordinating, and, finally, eval-
uating the various studies carried out by consultants. Decisions are gen-
erally made at a higher level and more on an intuitive basis than by a
detailed analysis of the economic advantages and disadvantages of the pro-
posal. The Government is aware of these deficiencies and has informed the
Association that, among other measures, it intends to employ a qualified
and experienced transport economist to improve planning and coordination of
transport investments as well as to review salient transport policy issues.
2.14      There is little regulation of goods' movements in the transport
market; both the railroad and the trucking industry are free to set rates
and adapt market policies. The expanding road industry has attracted most
of the general traffic from the railroad. So far the railroad has been
able to compete successfully for the transport of phosphate; for shipments
between Ruseifa and Beirut it now charges slightly less than the trucking
rate of JD 1.6 per m ton. On its southern link, pending construction of the
Aqaba branch line, the railroad has completely lost this traffic as a result
of a boycott by the road industry, which refused to carry the phosphate from
the rail terminal at Ras en Naqb to Aqaba. The railroad's rates are understood
to cover nll operational costs, including track maintenance and a track depre-
ciation charge.  Estimates of revenues from r6ad-user taxes during the past
few years covered expenditures on the network (para. 3.09). The taxation
structure favors heavy vehicles, but it is unlikely that a higher taxation
of trucks would have any major impact on the distribution of traffic between
road and rail.
III. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
3.01      The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for Jordan's national
highway system, which comprises 1,760 km of primary roads (1,460 km or 83%
paved) and 1,040 km of secondary roads (690 km or 66% paved). The network
has grown at about 4% p.a., with a reduction in 1967 due to the loss of
the West Bank territories.  Table 1 shows the changes in lengths of these
categories resulting from new construction and improvements. Village or
feeder roads were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior's



Department for Municipal and Rural Affairs until 1970 when they were trans-
ferred back to the Ministry. The length maintained in 1969 was 1,715 km,
of which 1,110 km (65%) were paved.
3.02      In general, this highway system (Map) adequately connects all
populated parts of the country. Surfaced roads lead from Amman to Aqaba
and the borders of Syria and Iraq. In the seven-year plan (para. 2.11)
which allocated about 50% of the highway funds to improvements of the
existing network, only two new construction projects were planned: the
Aqaba-Safi road to serve the Dead Sea potash development project near Safi
(para. 2.12), and the Ma'an-Mudawwara road to provide a link with southern
Saudi Arabia (para. 2.07). The latter was completed in 1970. The list of
highway projects has since been extended and priorities have changed. Em-
phasis is now on expanding the network in the Amman area and improving road
connections with Syria and Iraq, and the newly-built road system in northern
Saudi Arabia.
3.03      Adequate regulations are in force governing the maximum dimensions
and axle loading of vehicles. Weighing stations at Ramtha on the Syrian
border, the Port of Aqaba, and the phosphate mines at El Hassa and Ruseifa
ensure that vehicles using the major haulage routes are not overloaded.
In addition, the truckers' association (para. 3.08) polices its members to
ensure that no operator deprives another of livelihood by overloading his
vehicles; this control is exercised most effectively. During credit nego-
tiations, the Government gave an assurance that it will continue to enforce
regulations controlling the dimensions and axle loading of vehicles.
B.   Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.04      Jordan's motor vehicle fleet (Table 2) grew at an average annual
rate of about 10%, from 12,770 vehicles in 1960 to 24,500 in 1967. Passen-
ger cars increased at the comparatively high rate of 15% p.a. over this
period, and represented 42% of the fleet in 1967. In 1968 there were about
25,900 vehicles in Jordan, more than two-thirds of which were registered in
the Amman district. During the 1967 war, many vehicles on the West Bank
were transferred to the East Bank. Statistics on the fleet for the years
after 1968 are not reliable.
3.05      The Ministry of Economy regulates motor vehicle importation by
issuing import licenses. These licenses have so far been granted freely and
are therefore not a means of restriction; import charges amount to about
100% of the vehicle's c.i.f. value. Growth of the commercial fleet is
controlled by the number of transport licences established annually by the
Traffic Council, in accordance with demand. This Council comprises repre-
sentatives from the Ministries of Economy, Interior, Finance, and Public
Works, as well as delegates from the interest groups concerned. Licenses
are transferable to allow for renewal of equipment.



3.06      The highest traffic is on the access roads to Amnan (8,000-10,000
vpd) and the main road to Syria and Lebanon (2,000-5,000 vpd). Other main
roads carry less than 2,000 vpd; most secondary roads, less than 500 vpd.
A small amount of traffic still passes to and from the West Bank. Traffic
growth over the last five years has been irregular, and has varied widely
from road to road; the general range has been about 10% to 15% p.a.,
roughly in line with the increase in fuel consumption (23% for gasoline
and 11% for gas-oil -- Table 3). The higher growth in gasoline consumption
reflects the steeper increase in the number and usage of passenger cars
(para. 3.04).
3.07      Cheap and efficient public passenger transport is provided by
taxis and buses, which serve all towns and major villages in Jordan as
well as the main centers in neighboring countries. Fares for taxis, which
are restricted by their licenses to a particular route, are about double
those for buses. Bus fares are Government controlled and vary between
fils 1.5 to 2.5 per km (US40.7 - 1.1 per mi).
3.08      Jordan's trucking industry consists of 20 companies with fleets
of more than 10 vehicles, and a large number of small operators. A strong
truckers' association controls about 40% (2,500 vehicles) of the country's
truck fleet; it negotiates and enters into contracts with clients, and
allocates the resulting haulage work among its members. It maintains firm
control over the traffic to and from the ports of Aqaba and Beirut. Despite
its rather monopolistic position, freight rates on the average (fils 6 - 9
per ton-km or US¶2.7 - 4 per ton-mi) are not excessive. Private trucking
is confined mainly to specialized transport; only the Jordan refinery and
the phosphate mines have sizeable fleets, although the operation of the
latter is subcontracted.
3.09      No firm data on receipts from road-user charges exists.  Based on
available material, the Association estimates the average annual revenue
from taxes on the use and ownership of vehicles (excluding import charges)
during the last four years at JD 2.4 million (US$6.7 million). Annual
expenditures (capital and recurrent) on the national highway network during
that same four-year period averaged JD 2.2 million (US$6.2 million).
C.  Highway Administration
3.10      The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for the construction
and maintenance of roads and public buildings. The Under-Secretary for
Public Works is the senior coordinating official to whom the Directors of
Highways and Buildings report (Chart). The highways headquarters is ade-
quately staffed and functions effectively, although it has some minor defi-
ciencies, such as inadequate cost accounting procedures, where worthwhile
improvements could be made and are proposed under this project (para. 4.06).
For the purposes of the Ministry's work, Jordan is divided into eight dis-
tricts, three of which are on the West Bank. Each is under the control of
a district engineer, whose duties include responsibility for all road works
in his district. The district organizations operate effectively.

D.   Highway Maintenance
3.11      Maintenance of Jordan's national highway system is the responsi-
bility of the Ministry's highway department. Mechanized methods are used
predominantly; the foundations for them were laid by the United States
Bureau of Public Roads (BPR). This agency, under US A.I.D. financing, was
responsible for technical assistance in the construction and maintenance
of roads by equipment intensive means during the years 1953-1965. It set
up training programs for operators, mechanics, technicians, materials
laboratory personnel, etc., and assisted in purchases of road construction
and maintenance equipment (the maintenance equipment cost about US$1.5
million) financed by US A.I.D. This equipment is held in a central pool
in Amman and is issued on hire as required. The Ministry still conducts
the training schemes for mechanics and equipment operators, although in the
latter case there now are no suitable instructors for field training, a
situation which this project seeks to remedy (para. 4.06).
3.12      Excellent central workshop facilities in Amman, constructed on
the advice of the BPR under US A.I.D. financing, are more than adequate
for the needs of the Ministry's equipment fleet. Distances in Jordan are
relatively short and little time is lost by sending equipment from the
provinces to Amman for major repair; consequently, district workshops
handle only minor repairs, and are adequately equipped for this service.
3.13      The Ministry normally undertakes maintenance works using its
departmental forces, but operations such as asphaltic paving, some resurfacing,
and the supply of crushed stone, are provided by contract. Thus, the Minis-
try avoids purchase and maintenance of expensive equipment, such as asphalt
plants, pavers, and quarry machinery, and takes advantage of competitive
rates offered by the contracting industry.
3.14      The present standard of road maintenance is fair.  Maintenance
of the riding surface is generally good, but shoulder and side drain
maintenance, normally a mechanized operation, is poor. The main reason for
these present conditions is the lack of skilled equipment operators; many
who were trained in the BPR programs have left Jordan for Saudi Arabia and
the Gulf States where higher wages are paid. This drain of skilled manpower
is understood to have diminished, but a reinforcement of training methods
to include more practical, on-the-job training in equipment operations is
now required for present and future staff.
3.15      Funds allocated for road maintenance over the period 1966-70 inclu-
sive are shown in Table 4 and currently provide an average of JD 100 per km
(US$280 per km) for the costs of labor, equipment (excluding depreciation),
and materials, but exclude the costs of administration and periodically re-
curring maintenance tasks, such as asphalt paving and surfacing. Clearly,
this provision will not finance routine maintenance at its present level;
some funds provided in the budget for administration and periodically recur-
ring maintenance are spent on routine maintenance, but the amounts involved
cannot be ascertained.



- 9 -
3.16      A practical approach to raising the standard of maintenance is
to improve the use of present manpower and equipment resources; for this
reason a general review of the maintenance organization by a consultant
is being financed by US A.I.D. The study (para. 4.06) will supplement the
excellent background work of BPR in this field and is being executed by
a consultant (Miller-Warden-Western/Frederic Harris, United States) already
commissioned for highway feasibility studies in Jordan under US A.I.D. spon-
sorship. During credit negotiations, the Government agreed to implement
those recommendations of the consultant agreed between the Association and
the Borrower in accordance with a timetable mutually acceptable to the
Association and the Government.
E.   Highway Engineering and Construction
3.17      The Director of Highways is responsible for executing road pro-
jects; his headquarters organization is adequately staffed with engineers
to fulfill this function (most senior engineers trained with the BPR). His
department undertakes necessary surveys and design, advertises construction
contracts, awards contracts according to standard Government procedures,
and supervises construction. Consultants, mostly foreign, are often employed
to provide some of these services, although local consulting firms are be-
coming more experienced in road works and can be expected to play a larger
role in future.
3.18      Highway design standards in Jordan were recommended by BPR and
are reasonable. Pavement design is based on Jordan's legal maximum axle
loading of 12 m tons, which takes into account the high proportion of
heavy vehicles in the country.
3.19      Each year the department conducts systematic traffic counts at
key points in the highway network. The resulting traffic figures are used
to a limited extent in the selection of road works. The proposed trans-
portation economist (para. 2.13) could assist the Government in better use
of these data. During credit negotiations, the Government confirmed its
intention to continue collecting and collating traffic data on a regular
and systematic basis.
3.20      Highway construction is normally executed under unit price con-
tracts awarded after competitive bidding. The domestic contracting industry
is small but active; more than a dozen contractors are registered with the
Government to undertake works of up to US$750,000 each (for contracts in
excess of this value, separate prequalification is required), but only one
is of a size capable of undertaking on his gwn the construction in this
project. On average, these contractors have about US$500,000 invested in
construction equipment, and, as a group, provide an annual contractual ca-
pacity of about US$5 million. About 30 smaller contractors exist, with
total work potential of about US$3 million p.a. The Ministry undertakes
some construction by force account; these operations are usually restricted
to minor improvements, limited road widening, and similar operations which
do not lend themselves conveniently to execution by contract.



- 10 -
F.   Financing
3.21      Budget proposals submitted by the ministries are reviewed by the
Ministry of Finance and the JDB; after the Government budget is approved,
funds are released to the ministries. During the fiscal year, the JDB
can provide the ministries with additional funds from its own unallocated
reserve. Besides being the coordinating agency, the JDB is responsible for
all foreign assistance. The 1966-1970 expenditures on the national highway
system, which form the major part of the Ministry's budget, are given in
Table 4.
3.22      Before 1967, expenditures on (routine) maintenance were fairly
constant at about JD 300,000 (US$840,000) p.a. Almost in proportion to
the reduction in network length after the loss of the West Bank in 1967,
expenditures dropped to about JD 250,000 (US$700,000) in 1968 and 1969.
Although there is a 10% increase in the 1970 maintenance allocation, main-
tenance expenditures in general are unrelated to the increase in usage and
the changes in the standards of the road network. However, as budgetary
allocations for maintenance are to be reviewed by the maintenance consultant
(paras. 3.16 and 4.06), the 1970 allocation is adequate for the present.
During credit negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that it will
allocate adequate funds annually for proper highway maintenance.
3.23      Annual highway expenditures other than for routine maintenance
and administration during 1966-1969 averaged JD 1.9 million (US$5.3 million).
An estimated 60% of these expenditures were from foreign aid and loans. Local
funds financed the remaining 40% and were used principally on force account
works.
3.24      It is difficult to predict the future pattern of highway expen-
ditures. Excluding the Amman-Zarqa road construction and force account
improvement works, projects now being considered total some JD 10 million
(US$28 million). Financing for most is unresolved, and feasibility studies
remain to be done. Considering the Government's investment needs in other
sectors and the present commitments of bilateral lending agencies to Jordan,
it is unlikely that annual highway investments will exceed JD 2 million
(US$5.6 million) in the next few years.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   General Description
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(a) construction of a new road, about 18 km long, between Amman
and Zarqa, including supervision by consultants;



- 11 -
(b) purchase of road maintenance equipment;
(c) assistance, if required, by consultants in implementing the
agreed findings of the US A.I.D.-sponsored maintenance study;
(d) advice, by consultants, on requirements for purchases of road
maintenance equipment and preparation of specifications for
its procurement; and
(e) an urban transportation study of metropolitan Amman by consult-
ants.
The United Nations Development Programme is interested in financing (c) above,
if required, and US A.I.D. has included provision for (d) above in the terms
of reference for the maintenance consultant.
B.   Amman-Zarga Highway (18 km)
4.02      The existing paved road from Amman to Zarqa is inadequate for
present traffic needs. The first 4 km from Amman is a narrow congested
four-lane section and the remainder is two-lane. Alignment of the first
few kilometers is characterized by steep gradients and poor sight dis-
tances; urban development precludes any major improvements. A pattern of
unplanned ribbon development throughout the remainder of the road limits
its capacity and makes improvements unduly expensive.
4.03      After a study which compared two other alignments and an improved
existing alignment, the Government's consultants (De Leuw Cather Interna-
tional/Jouzy and Partners, United States/Lebanon) proposed a new four-lane
divided highway to the standards indicated in Table 5, which are satis-
factory. The possibility of stage construction was investigated, but found
to be impracticable. The new alignment crosses the existing road only once,
and a traffic interchange will be constructed at that point. At-grade in-
tersections with other roads are expected to carry only small traffic vol-
umes. On the outskirts of Zarqa, the project road joins a street which is
being widened to four-lanes, and is capable of handling the forecast traffic.
All land needed for road construction has been obtained.
4.04      The Municipality of Amman is planning a four-lane limited access
continuation of the project road to an intersection near the center of the
city, where traffic may disperse more satisfactorily, but this may not be
the best long-term solution. To provide access until completion of the
necessary planning studies and construction of the most desirable. traffic
distributor (para. 4.07), the project road will be connected initially with
an existing six-lane city street which will meet traffic requirements for
about five years after the new road will have been opened.



- 12 -
C.   Road Maintenance Equipment
4<.05     Much of the present maintenance equipment, which was purchased
from US A.I.D. funds on the advice of BPR, is now between six and sixteen
years old and many items should be replaced. Replacement value of equip-
ment in use is about US$3 million, with annual renewal costs of about US$0.3
million. An equipment renewal fund, financed from rentals, is in operation,
but is under-financed because allowances for depreciation are inadequate.
During credit negotiations, the Government agreed to institute such better
arrangements for financing the renewal of road maintenance equipment as
would be defined by the agreed findings of the maintenance study. The
Government has submitted to the Association a list of the most urgently
needed equipment items, totaling about US$0.5 million, for purchase under
the proposed Credit (Table 6). The maintenance consultant, whose services
are being financed by US A.I.D. (para. 4.06), will verify these requirements
before the Government purchases the agreed items under international com-
petitive bidding.
D.   Maintenance Consultants' Services
4.06      To assist the Government by identifying possible shortcomings
in its maintenance organization, US A.I.D. is financing consultants whose
terms of reference include a brief review of the maintenance department
with recommendations for needed improvements arn other matters, such as
establishing an adequate cost accounting system, and an equipment replace-
ment program, and proposals for improvement of training programs. During
credit negotiations, the Government agreed to implement those findings of
the consultant as will be mutually agreeable to the Association and the
Borrower.
E.   Urban Transportation Study
4.07      The most appropriate method for distributing traffic from the
project road in Amman should be based on a limited study of the city's
future land use and related transport patterns with a more detailed study
of the access corridor of the project road. Accordingly, an allowance of
US$0.4 million has been made in the project for the necessary studies,
which would be undertaken by a consultant. The findings of the study are
expected by mid-1973, allowing ample time for construction of the recom-
mended solution to be completed before the end of 1978 when additional
facilities will be needed to allow the full capacity of the Amman-Zarqa
road to be utilized. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it will:
(a)  undertake the necessary urban planning studies without delay
and complete them before July 31, 1974; and
(b)  provide the Association, no later than December 31, 1974
with a timetable for construction of the additional traffic
facilities required in the Amman area, as agreed with the
Association.

F.   Cost Estimate and Foreign Exchange Component
4.08      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$8.7 million equi-
valent, including contingency allowances. A summary of the project cost and
the Association's participation follows:

a/   A small amount for local handling, transport, and assembly.
4.09      The construction costs shown are based on the evaluation of eight
bids received in Amman on April 24, 1971. Contractors from six countries
participated, and the lowest bidder, to whom the contract award is recom-
mended, is a Britislh/Jordanian joint venture. The unusual procedure of
receiving bids for the project road construction before presentation of the
project to the Board of Executive Directors was adopted because the effect
on bidding of recent events in Jordan and the Middle East could not be
forecast.
4.10      The foreign exchange component of construction costs is estimated
at 65%; this is consistent with execution of the contract by a foreign/local
joint venture contractor. Supervision of construction by the Ministry's
foreign consultants is estimated to have a 70% foreign cost; execution of
the Amman urban transportation study is estimated to have an 80% foreign



- 14 -
exchange component. The cost of maintenance equipment is shiown in thie
summary at 100% of its c.i.f. landed value.  rhe local assembly and delivery
costs are assumed to be nominal.
4.11      The contingency allowances are reasonable.  The 5% for construc-
tion price escalation is the average estimated price increase over the
period from receipt of bids to completion of construction. A 10% contin-
gency allowance has been made to cover possible quantity increases during
construction. Equal increases are expected in local and foreign costs on the
basis of available information. The 4% allowance for maintenance equipment
is assessed on a similar basis for the two-year period between the preparation
of estimates and the anticipated procurement. The 10% allowance for consul-
tants' services is to cover possible increases in the man-months of work re-
quired.
G.   Project Financing and Execution
4.12      The proposed credit would be to the Government of Jordan.  The
local costs would be met by the Government from funds earmarked for this
project in its development budget; no difficulties in providing these funds
are foreseen. The executing agency would be the Ministry of Public Works,
assisted by qualified consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association. Agreement was obtained from the Government during credit
negotiations that it will promptly retain consultants for construction super-
vision and for other expert services provided in the project (paras. 4.06
and 4.07).
4.13      The construction contract has been tendered on the basis of unit
prices after international competitive bidding, and in accordance with
the Association's "Guidelines on Procurement". The contract will be awarded
in June 1971, and on this basis, construction should be completed by the end
of 1973. The consultant for the urban studies of Amman should complete his
work by the end of 1973.
H.  Disbursements
4.14      Credit funds will be disbursed as follows:
Highway construction - 65% of payments to construction
contractors.
Road maintenance equipment - 100% of the c.i.f. landed
cost.
Consultant's services - the foreign exchange cost of
payments to consultants.
Any surplus funds remaining in the Credit Account on completion of the proj-
ect will be cancelled. A schedule of cumulative quarterly credit disburse-
ments is shown in Annex A.

V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Amman-Zarga Highway
5.01      The proposed 18 km four-lane highway between Amman and Zarqa will
relieve traffic congestion on the existing road (para. 4.02). The road is
one of the most vital traffic arteries in Jordan's highway network; it
links the two largest cities on the East Bank and is part of the main routes
from Amman to Jordan's northern and eastern neighbors. Failure to provide
additional road capacity could have serious implications on the development
of the Amman-Zarqa corridor and the country.
5.02      The Amman-Zarqa road serves about 700,000 people, approximately
one-third of Jordan's total population. Amman has about 400,000 inhabi-
tants, and Zarqa, 150,000. Population growth is above average because
of a continuing influx of refugees and immigration from rural areas which
is stimulated by employment opportunities in the industries concentrated
in the corridor. More than 90% of all sizeable industrial establishments
on Jordan's East Bank are located in the Amman District (which includes
Zarqa). Fifty-six industrial plants are located along the Amman-Zarqa
road; these employ a labor force of about 4,000 and have an annual produc-
tion of about 1 million m tons. The largest plants are those of the phos-
phate mines in Ruseifa (annual output 500,000 m tons) and the Jordan Refinery
near the Zarqa terminal (annual output 400,000 m tons). Military establish-
ments near Zarqa create some traffic on the road, however, the volume of this
traffic was identified in the counts and omitted from the economic analysis.
5.03      The majority of vehicles using the road travel the full distance
between Amman and Zarqa, and for this traffic there is no alternative route.
A lightly trafficked branch road leads from Ruseifa to Suweileh and the
construction of another from west of Ruseifa to the Desert Road (southern
by-pass) is being considered by the Government. Both would involve con-
siderable detours for traffic to and from Amman. The railroad, which paral-
lels the road, is an insignificant factor in the carriage of passenger or
freight traffic between the two towns.
5.04      The present traffic volume on the existing road is 10,400 vpd (Table
7), 59% of which are passenger cars and taxis. The savings in vehicle operat-
ing costs and time for the 75% of total traffic expected to use the new high-
way are fils 6.1 per km (US42.7 per mi) for passenger cars, fils 3.6 (US,1.6
per mi) for taxis, fils 9.3 (USs4.2 per mi) for buses, and fils 3.8 (US,1.7
per mi) for trucks. These savings represent between 10% and 27% of present
operating costs (Table 8). Further detail on traffic and benefits is given
in Annex B.
5.05      The proposed investment, conservatively estimated, would yield
a rate of return of 17% over an assumed 20-year life. If the time value of
passengers, which has been evaluated at JD 0.37 (US$1.03) per hour for pri-
vate cars, JD 0.07 (US$0.20) for taxis, and JD 0.48 (US$1.35) for buses, is



- 16 -
excluded from the benefits, the rate of return would be 10%. The sensitiv-
ity of the rate of return was tested by reducing the benefits and the assumed
traffic growth by 25% and simultaneously increasing the costs of construction
(including contingencies) and land acquisition by 10%.  Even with these ex-
treme assumptions, the rate of return would be 10%, which is acceptable.
Because of uncertainties about the future, a further test was made to
determine the annual average growth rate of traffic which would be required
for a rate of return of 12%.  The resulting rate is 5%, which is lower than
actual past increases an(I would certainly be exceeded under stable conditions
in the country and a modest overall growth of the economy.
B.   Road Maintenance Equipment
5.07      The US$500,000 for maintenance equipment proposed in this project
would meet urgent replacement needs in the existing equipment fleet. The
maintenance consultant (para 4.06) will review the Government's request for
equipment (Table 6) on the basis of an assessment of overall equipment needs
and will recommend how maintenance practices, and the use of equipment in
particular, can be improved.
5.08      The average age of the equipment proposed for replacement is 10 to
12 years. The available data do not lend themselves to comprehensive cost
analyses from which optimum replacement ages could be derived. However, the
items being considered are certainly well beyond such optimum ages. Their
"repair and oil" costs in 1968 and 1969 were 70-100% higher and their effec-
tive working time 40-50% lower than for comparable machinery about five years
old. Therefore, purchase of new equipment is justified on the basis of exces-
sive running expenses and decreased availability for use of the existing items.
To make up for shortages of equipment for present maintenance operations, the
Government has often been obliged to rent machinery from private sources at
higher costs.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations, the Government gave a number of assur-
ances, the most important of which are that it will: implement, in accord-
ance with an agreed timetable, the agreed findings of the maintenance con-
sultant (para. 3.16); undertake, without delay, the necessary urban studies
to identify arrangements for distributing traffic from the Amman-Zarqa road
(para. 4.07); and provide the Association, by December 31, 1974, with a
timetable for the construction of additional traffic facilities required in
the Amman area, as agreed with the Association (para. 4.07).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDS
credit of US$6.0 million equivalent to the Covernment of Jordan nn thc
usual terms.

JORDAN
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
Further Information on Traffic and Benefits
1.        Traffic volume on the existing Amman-Zarqa road is highest at the
Mahatta end in Amman (16,000 vpd), and falls to about 10,000 vpd in Marka,
4 km from Amman; from this point it remains fairly constant to Zarqa. Pri-
vate passenger cars and taxis represent 59% of total traffic; trucks, 19%;
buses, 6%; and vehicles of military and para-military organizations, 16%.
Civilian traffic declined radically after 1967. Between 1961 and 1967, an-
nual growth rates averaged 8%; during 1968 and 1969 traffic increased nearly
25% p.a. This steep increase resulted from the 1967 influx of approximately
100,000 refugees, a great many of whom settled in the area adjoining the
road, and from the change in the trade flow pattern (para. 2.04).
2.        Forecasting future traffic with any degree of accuracy is dif-
ficult, if not impossible, under the present circumstances. For the project
analysis, traffic has been assumed to grow, up to the fifth year of opera-
tion of the new road, at annual rates of 12% for private passenger cars, 10%
for taxis and buses, and 8% for trucks; thereafter growth is assumed to con-
tinue at reduced rates of 8%, 6%, and 5%, respectively (Table 7). These rates
have no "scientific" basis but they in general agreement with the current
state of development in the area. The traffic generating effect of the new
highway has not been considered separately.
3.        The main benefits of the proposed highway will be savings in
vehicle operating costs and passenger time and due to relief in congestion
and increase in operating speeds. The possible capacity of the major part
of the existing road is some 900 vph; hourly traffic volumes now vary be-
tween 500 and 700 vehicles and travel speeds average 40 to 45 km/h (25 to
28 mph). With increasing traffic, speeds will further decrease and operat-
ing costs increase. For the calculation of benefits, travel speeds of 40
km/h (25 mrph) for light vehicles and 35 km/h (22 mph) for heavy vehicles
were used for the existing road and of 80 km/h (50 mph) and 60 km/h (37 mph)
for the new highway.  The speed assumptions for the existing road probably
understate the conditions prevailing until the new highway is opened in 1974.
4.        The estimates of vehicle operating costs on the existing road and
on the new highway are given in Table 8. The estimated savings per km are
fils 6.1 (US42.7 per mi) for private cars, fils 3.6 (US41.6 per mi) for taxis,
fils 9.3 (USd4.2 per mi) for buses, and fils 3.8 (US$41.7 per mi) for trucks.
Most savings in vehicle operating costs are from reductions in the costs
of depreciation, interest, and wages. When determining the cost of depre-
ciation and interest for trips on the new highway, it was assumed that only
part of the travel time savings would lead to a higher vehicle utilization.



ANNEX B
Page 2
Since most passengers in private cars, taxis, and buses are either on busi-
ness trips or on trips to and from work, it is appropriate to include in the
analysis an evaluation of their time. In line with the results of studies
made in other countries 1/ on how transport users evaluate reductions in
travel time, one-third of their earning rate was applied. Taking account
of the average vehicle occupancies, the total value of passenger time sav-
ings resulted in JD 0.37 (US$1.03) per hour for private cars, JD 0.07
(US$0.20) for taxis, and JD 0.48 (US$1.35) for buses.
5.        Benefits were calculated only for the 75% of total traffic which
will divert to the new highway (Table 8). The benefits from reduced con-
gestion to traffic continuing to use the existing road, which are about 20%
of the assessed benefits in the opening year and then will decrease again,
have been disregarded. Further, benefits from a probable reduction in
traffic accidents (390 in 1968, including 20 fatalities and 284 injuries)
have not been quantified.
