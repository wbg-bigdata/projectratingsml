THAILAND
BANGKOK TRAFFIC IIANAGEMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Urban Development in Thailand
1.01      Thailand's urban sector is characterized by a moderately rapid rate
of growth and the predominance of Bangkok. In 1976, 7.3 million people (or
17% of the nation's population) lived in urban areas. During 1970-76, the
urban areas grew at an average rate of 4.9% per annum, compared to a total
national population growth rate of about 2.9% per annum. The urban growth
rate is expected to increase during the next decade because of the diminishing
supply of unoccupied agricultural land.
1.02      Bangkok, with a 1977 population of 4.8 million and an annual growth
rate of about 5%, accounts for 60% of Thailand's total urban population. Al-
though the city accounts for only 10% of the total national population, it
contributed 27% of national GDP in 1976, and its Gross Regional Product per
capita (B 20,006) was 2.6 times greater than the Gross Domestic Product per
capita (B 7,582). In 1976, Thailand's second largest city, Chiang Mai, had an
urban population of only 105,000.
1.03      Government urban policies articulated in the Fourth Development Plan
(1977-81) emphasize the promotion of regional urban centers as well as improve-
ment of conditions in Bangkok. However, the Government has not developed an
explicit: strategy and investment program to develop the nine regional centers
designat:ed in the Plan. The technical assistance component of the proposed
project includes funds to prepare projects to promote urban development out-
side Bangkok (Annex 1).
B. Bangkok Metropolitan Area
Economy and Poverty Population
1.04      Bangkok is an economically dynamic city.  The private sector is
characterized by small firms, competition and price responsiveness. The
city's manufacturing industries are diversified, with textiles and apparel
accounting for almost 30% of industrial employment. Basic metal industries,
including manufacture of metal products, machinery, transport equipment and
appliances, account for another 28%. Unemployment rates have been unusually
low, estimated at less than 2.5% during the first half of the 1970s.
Poverty Population
1.05      The city of Bangkok is relatively prosperous compared to overall
Thai income standards. Only 9% of the city's population is below the "abso-
lute poverty" line established by the Bank. Approximately 15%, however,
are below the "relative poverty" line. With the exception of the Klong Toey



- 2 -
area next to the port complex, there are no large concentrations of squatter
settlements which might demand special localized transportation services.
There are, however, large numbers of small poverty pockets scattered through-
out the metropolitan area. The average Thai family at the 10% income per-
centile (approximately equal to the absolute poverty line) makes over 14,000
Baht annually (approximately $60/month) which is sufficient to accommodate
regularly at least one bus rider in the family. It is estimated that less
than 10% of Bangkok families can afford a car and that, at most, 20% can
afford some form of private motorized transportation; the remainder, including
all of the urban poor, rely exclusively on buses for their motorized travel
(so:e also paras 5.19-5.25).
:neral Pattern of City Development
1.06      Bangkok can be perceived as a city growing in a generally concentric
fashion, with a densely populated core and with densities diminishing in in-
verse proportion to the radius to a distance of approximately 8 km from the
center. Then there is a sharper decrease in density as urbanization blends
into the rural area. Poor accessibility to the area west of the river,
combined with the rolling and high-valued farmland, has stunted development
of this area. Nevertheless, Thonburi has developed as a twin city to Bangkok
on the west bank and has potential for further growth. In recent years,
Bangkok has grown mostly east and north. It can be expected that, with the
construction of new roads, a substantial amount of development will occur on
large vacant tracts of land on the city's northeast and south sides.
Land Use Characteristics
1.07      Bangkok can be generally typified as a highly amorphous city with
a mixture of land-use activities which minimizes work-related travel. Shop
houses, with their attendant residential, industrial and commercial uses, can
be found in all parts of the city. There is nb single strong central business
district in the western sense and, in the core area of the city which is
about 5 km in diameter, a large amount of residential development is mixed
with commercial development. On the city's north and east sides, large areas
of predominantly residential use have developed but, even in these areas,
there is a mixture of income levels and dwelling types as the population
tries to remain close to places of work and commerce.
1.08      Responsibility for the city's administration rests primarily with
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), created in 1972 to consolidate
urban management functions in the greater metropolitan area.  BMA has over
30,000 employees.  Its responsibilities include primary education, construc-
tion and maintenance of roads and canals ("klongs"), sanitation, drainage,
medical services and social welfare, with over half of its (1978) budget of
approximately Baht 2.8 billion ($142 million) going to education (21%) and
public works (29%). While BMA enjoys considerable local autonomy, several
municipal services are provided by other government agencies, the most im-
portant being the Metropolitan Water Works Authority, the Metropolitan Elec-
tricity Authority, the Telephone Organization of Thailand, the Metropolitan
Police Bureau, the National Housing Authority, and the Bangkok Mass Transit



- 3 -
Authority. The tax base of the city is weak with only about 14% of BMA's
revenues being levied locally. The bulk of BMA's revenues comes from a
business tax (30%), vehicle registration (25%) and government grants (11%);
only 2% come from property valuation taxation.
C. Existing Transport Conditions in Bangkok
Road Syst:em
1.09      Bangkok's transportation infrastructure can be generally charac-
terized by a very low proportion of space devoted to roadways (not more
than 10% in the inner core) and a road network dependent on a limited number
of major roads with only a few connecting links, particularly outside the
grid network in the central area of the city. The remaining road network,
consisting of a discontinuous jumble of minor streets or "sois," is typi-
cally narrow, winding, and has poor system continuity. The net result is a
supply and configuration of road space that is unable to cope adequately with
existing transport demand, let alone projected or latent transport growth. As
the motor vehicle fleet expands at an approximate rate of over 8% annually
(see Table I-1), the comparatively modest road building and traffic management
measures that have been introduced have not been able to keep pace. Travel
speeds have accordingly declined and will decline further until a point is
reached where certain trips are deferred or altogether eliminated as the costs
of travel become too high. There is some evidence to indicate that this point
may have already been reached as typical car speeds are only 12 km/h and bus
speeds '3 km/h during the heaviest travel hours in the central area of the city.
Furthermore, congestion has reached such high levels that no discernible
"peak hour" can be determined as heavy traffic spreads throughout most of the
working day.

Public Transport
1.10      More than 60% of person trips in the primary direction of travel
on arterial streets are carried by buses and minibuses which constitute
only 6% of the stream of passenger vehicles. In contrast, private cars which
form the bulk of the traffic stream (57% of all vehicles) carry only 26% of
all person trips (see Table 1-2).

and 17:00-17:45. All observations made in primary travel direction.
/2   Seating capacity of bus is 40 passengers; actual average occupancy
may have been substantially higher.
1.11      Fixed route bus services are provided by the Bangkok Mass Transit
Authority (BMTA). In addition, a large number of authorized and unauthorized
minibus services operate in the city.
1.12      The BMTA was established by the Government as a state enterprise
under the Ministry of Communications in April 1976 by the amalgamation of
24 private bus companies. The Authority has recently expanded its fleet,
assisted by Government financing; by fall 1978, the total operational fleet
consisted of approximately 4,740 units (see Table I-3), making it one of the
largest in the world. It operates about 100 regular routes and an additional



- 5 -
11 routes which offer air-conditioned services. In March 1978, the total
number of daily passenger trips averaged about 3.3 million. Estimated peak
demand was about 75% over off-peak, while peak supply was only 35% above off-
peak. This implies considerable overloading of buses during peak travel hours.

1.13      In order to accommodate the modal shift that will be generated by
Government policy measures under the proposed project, BMTA must improve on
its operations. Certain factors adversely affecting BMTA's services, such
as traffic congestion, are beyond its control. However, BMTA has to overcome
internal problems, created by the amalgamation and basically related to the
enlarged scale of operations in management, operations, maintenance and
finance.
1.14      Because of poor financial performance since its establishment,
BMTA has accumulated operational deficits which at October 31, 1977 amounted
to about B 340 million and exceed the pa:id-up capital of the Authority.



- 6 -
cording to the summary balance sheet available at that date, total assets
ounting to about B 690 million were represented entirely by external debt
ability of which 40 percent related to trade creditors and overdraft
cilities. Current assets amounted to about B 10 million compared to cur-
nt liabilities of nearly B 300 million.  The substantially increased fleet
pacity and recently revised fares structure wi:Ll result in FY 1978 revenues
more than double the FY 1977 revenue level. However, in the absence of
ternal financial resources, the fleet expansion is being financed by long-
rm loans involving substantial interest expenses and requiring a considerably
,creased depreciation provision. The April 1, 1]978 fare increase from B 0.75
S03.75) to B 1.00 (USd5.00) will help stem further deterioration in financial
rformance, but additional measures will need to be taken to rationalize the
thority's capital structure and secure financial viability over the medium
rm. Technical assistance included in the project provides for a detailed
view of BMTA finances and development of financial targets and the design
.d installation of effective systems for financial control and forward
anning (para 2.35).
15      Minibuses, whether authorized or unauthorized, provide valuable
Lblic transport services in Bangkok. About 2,000 authorized minibuses,
erated under a franchise by three groups of independent operators on BMTA
utes, carry about 600,000 daily passenger trips, 1/ and most of them charge
'vernment established fares. In addition, a range of 5,000 to 8,000 "illegal"
either properly licensed nor franchised) minibuses operate in the city, 2/
arging about the same as regular fares during the daytime, but up to 100%
ove those fares during the night time. A Government-appointed committee
considering all relevant issues related to the role of minibuses as well
other modes of public transport in Bangkok. They perform a valuable
.rvice as they cut excess peak demand for public transport, and ply many
.rrow streets not accessible to standard size buses. During negotiations,
surances were obtained that the Government will define in consultation with
Le Bank and not later than December 31, 1979, the role of all modes of public
*ansport in Bangkok in order to meet the needs of- the travelling public, and
iplement an agreed policy by mid 1980.
D. Ongoing and Planned Transport Infrastructure Investments
Independent of the Proposed Project
16      There are at least four major transport investments currently under
.y in Bangkok that have some relationship to the proposed project: (a) a
,11 road being constructed by the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority
TA) from the port area to Din Daeng, where it links up with the "Super-
.ghway" leading northward to the airport and points beyond (see Map 13577R);
,) a "Middle Ring" Road being constructed by BMA, one-third of which is in
:istence (mostly on the Thonburi side) and another third under construction;
As tentatively estimated by the Ministry of Communications.
No reliable information exists on the number of daily passenger trips
by "illegal" minibuses.



(c) a Sathorn Road extension and bridge being constructed by BMA. This road
will provide a much needed southern by-pass to the congested core area; and
(d) a. road also being constructed by BMA extending easterly from the inter-
section of Din Daeng and Soi Asoke to Soi 71 providing traffic relief to
Petchbur:i Road and better access to the developing northeastern quadrant of
the city. Additionally, the ETA has appointed consultants to undertake a
feasibility study of constructing a mass transit system on its own right of
way.
E.  Bank Involvement and Strategy in Urban Transport Sector
1.17      Bank involvement in the urban transport sector in Bangkok dates
back to 1969 when a Bank mission explored the possibility of supervising
a proposed UNDP study of transport in the city. Subsequently the Bank
was involved in reviewing the proposed terms of reference for an urban
transpo:rt study to be financed by the Government of the Federal Republic
of Germany. During the years 1973-1976, the Bank was actively involved
in reviewing the work of this study produced by a team of German consultants
F.H, Kochs and Rhein-Ruhr Ing-GMBH which was attached to the Office of
Metropolitan Traffic Planning. The consultants proposed a number of improve-
ments which could be basically classified as (a) long-term capital intensive
extensions to the transport infrastructure and (b) short-term low capital
improvements to the existing infrastructure. The Bank responded positively
to the Government's request for financial assistance to implement many of the
propose.d short-term low capital investments provided the Government would
undertake steps to discourage the uneconomic use of private cars in favor of
higher occupancy vehicles.
1.18      These discussions were not immediately successful due principally
to the Government's reluctance to institute strong traffic restraint policy
measures and its desire to place highest priority on the proposed capital
intensive projects including a toll road system currently being constructed
by the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA). In the meantime an
Urban Transportation Planning Office (UTPO) was created based on the German
consultants' recommendations and served as a base for updating the consultants
recommendations and for continuing the triansportation planning process in
Bangkok.
I_i9      During late 1977 the Government/Bank dialogue came to fruition
in the face of continually deteriorating traffic conditions.  At this time
the Government decided to proceed with short-term traffic relief measures
combinied with stringent policy measures aimed at discouraging uneconomic
use of low occupancy vehicles (principally private autos) and encouraging
high occupancy vehicles (principally buses). In support of these policy
commitments the Minister of Interior has appointed four committees, reporting
to the National Traffic Board (see para 3.02) to prepare detailed proposals
for (i) area pricing (paras 2.26 and 2.27), (ii) parking (paras 2.28, 2.29
and 2,30), (iii) staggered working and school hours (para 2.31), and (iv)
traffic noise abatement and air pollution detection (para 2.17). The Gov-
ernment has also strengthened the UTPO by giving it greater powers and staff;
and the Cabinet intends to further strengthen this office (para 3.02).

II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS, AND FINANCING
A. Project Objectives
2.01      Bangkok's traffic situation has deteriorated to the point where
congestion is placing serious restraints on the continued economic develop-
ment of the city. The costs of travel (measured in person-time and vehicle
operating costs) are very high and promise to climb still higher, threatening
strangulation of economic activity and the increases in economic potential
offered by a dynamic urban environment. Accordingly, the principal project
objectives are to increase (a) travel speeds and (b) person-trip capacity of
the existing transportation system in order to facilitate the continued
economic development of Bangkok, without diverting scarce resources from other
high priority development activities in Thailand. The project further aims
to improve permanently the capability of Bangkok officials to plan, design,
execute and enforce projects and programs directed at maintaining and improving
transportation conditions within the metropolis. Recognizing the importance
of decentralizing urban development in Thailand, a separate but related
project objective is to encourage urban and industrial growth outside of
Bangkok (see Annex 1).
B. Main Proiect Features
Principal Project Components
2.02      The proposed project will include:  (a) strengthening of urban
transport management, particularly as it relates to strengthening the Urban
Transportation Planning Office (UTPO) and the Traffic Police Division (TPD),
(b) increasing the capacity of the urban road network through low cost
improvements to selected intersections and road links, and through the
provision of equipment for more effective traffic control; (c) improving
public transport by strengthening the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA),
by providing additional bus lanes and bus bays and by giving priority to high
occupancy vehicles; (d) implementing specific policies designed to discourage
the uneconomic use of low occupancy vehicles; and (e) technical assistance
to support the above project activities, and to conduct an Eastern seaboard
and national secondary cities development study.
2.03      The basic feature of the project is the policy package -- including
area pricing, bus priority measures, parking controls, and staggering of
working and school hours -- which will discourage the use of non-essential
private vehicle travel. Without this policy package, unchecked traffic
growth, particularly in Bangkok's central area, would offset the impact
of proposed low-cost physical improvcelutL L" a short-term period. The onl-y
alternative solution would require substantial, costly, and time-consuming
additions to the existing road network which, however, has low priority in



Thailana's economic development needs. By combining these policy measures
with selected high-priority traffic engineering and management schemes, the
Government will achieve expeditious relief to Bangkok's traffic congestion
at a high rate of return (see Chapter V).
Project Elements Summarized
2.04      The proposed project components described above would be made up
of specific project elements as outlined below and as further described in
Section E of this chapter. The intended effect of each specific project
element is summarized in Table II-1.
(a.) strengthen urban transport management:
(i)  strengthening the Urban Transportation Planning
Office5(UTPO), to improve its ability to plan
and design traffic management projects (no
project cost allocation);
(ii)  restructuring and strenghening  the Traffic
Police Division (TPD) of the Metropolitan
(Bangkok) Police Bureau to improve traffic
operations and enforcement (no project cost
allocation);
(iii)  specialized police equipment to improve police
mobility and communications in improvi-ng traffic
management and enforcement ($1.1 million);
(iv)  traffic monitoring and air pollution detection
equipment to quantify changes in traffic volumes
and speeds and to determine levels of air and noise
pollution ($100,000); and
(v)  establishment of a traffic' noise abatement program
and air pollution detection program to reduce high
noise and air pollution levels along major road
arteries (no project cost allocation).
(b) increase capacity of the urban road network:
(i)  improvements in traffic signalling, including cen-
tralized traffic signal control, modernization of
existing signals, and new signal installations to
increase system capacity and safety ($2.5 million);
(ii)  road flyovers (seven) to increase road capacity
at critical intersections in the road network
($10.5 million);

($0.72 million).
Relationship of Project Elements
2.05      The above project elements are designed as a package and will require
some care in scheduling to assure smooth project performance (see proposed
project scheduling, para 4.01). Basically, the administrative changes and
technical assistance components of the project shLould be expedited to facilit-
ate project execution. The policy and physical components can be introduced
simultaneously with careful scheduling. However, introduction of the road
pricing scheme must follow sufficient physical improvements and improved
transit service that will accommodate expected shifts in travel patterns.
C. Cost Estimates
2.06      The total project cost is estimated at B 680 million ($34.0 million)
including taxes and duties of B 60 million ($3.0 million) with a foreign
exchange component of about B 320 million ($16.0 imillion) or about 47% of
total project cost. Property and land acquisition costs included are about
B 10 million ($0.5 million). Cost estimates are summarized in Table II-2.
2.07      Cost estimates are based on the following guidelines:  (a) for area
pricing, on preliminary specifications, subject to further technical studies;
(b) for traffic signal system, on an existing negotiated contract by a signal
manufacturer and comparable installed costs for non-negotiated equipment;
(c) for bus lanes, on preliminary engineering; (d) for flyovers, on detailed
engineering for two flyovers; (e) for other street improvements, on prelimin-
ary engineering; (f) for police and monitoring equipment, on recent bid prices
for similar equipment; and (g) for technical assistance, on February 1978
estimates. Local services are estimated at an average inclusive rate of
B 30,000 per eixnert month and foreign services at about $7,500 per expert-
month, including allowances for accommodation and transport.
2.08      All costs are expressed in 1978 prices.  Physical contingencies
of about 15% have been included. Price escalation on all works, goods and
services is estimated at 6.5% to 7% per year for goods and 7.5% to 8% per year

about 15% through 1981.
D. Financing
2.09      A proposed Bank loan of $16.0 million (B 320 million) would finance
47% of total project cost, equal to the foreign exchange cost, or about 52% of
project cost net of taxes, duties and land acquisition ($3.5 million). The
loan would be made to the Government at 7.35% interest, for a term of 20 years,
including a grace period of five years. The balance, $18.0 million (B 360
million) would be financed by the Government, as direct expenditures to be
channelled through the Ministry of Interior (MOI). Project funds will be
allocated by the Government through the annual budget to five agencies as
shown in Table II-3 below. During negotiations, assurances were received
that the Government will provide project funds on a timely basis to allow
expeditious project implementation.
2.10      In addition to the above amounts an equivalent of $72,000 (B 1.44
million) will be provided in the form of a grant by the U.K. Transport and
Road Research Laboratory for the purpose of monitoring project impacts (see
also paras. 4.09, 4.10). Beyond initial project costs, recurrent project
costs for implementing (a) area pricing (B 30 million), (b) parking controls
(B 30 million), and (c) bus lanes (B 6 million) are estimated. However, it
is further estimated that revenues from these schemes will greatly exceed the
recurrent costs (see Table V-3).

Collection and Disbursement of Revenues Generated by the Project
2.11      The project will generate substantial revenues through the mechan-
isms of (a) area pricing, and (b) to a lesser extent, through more extensive
and higher priced parking charges 1/. The Government is considering either to
(a) allow these collections to be part of general revenues, or (b) earmark
them, e.g. in a Bangkok Road Improvement Fund.
2.12      Whatever option the Government prefers to select, it is important
that appropriate charges will be levied for area pricing and parking schemes,
and that these schemes will be adequately operated and maintained. The policy
package to be submitted to the Bank will provide a financial plan on the
collection and disbursement of funds generaLted by area pricing and increased
parking charges.
E. Detailed Description of Project Elements
Strengthen Urban Transport Management
2.13      The UTPO - The Urban Transportation Planning Office, as the key
plannirLg, design, and management agency for the project, needs permanent
staff strengthening and interim technical assistance for the duration of
the project. Measures to strengthen the staff and to give the office more
author.ty are described separately in paras. 3.02, 3.03, and 3.04.
2.14      The Traffic Police Division.  To date, responsibility for traffic
controL and traffic law enforcement in the city has been undertaken by a 800
man traffic police force with assistance from police located in district
statio'as. Realiting the need for more coordinated action in these areas,
the Government has decided to reorganize the Metropolitan (Bangkok) Police
to provide a separate traffic-oriented line of command, the Traffic Police
Division (TPD), for about 2,000 traffic police. The police equipment to be
provided under the project will be procured, operated and maintained by the
TPD (see also para 3.05).
2.15      Police Equipment.  This equipment, including motorcycles and radio
communications, will enhance police mobility and reduce the need for point
duty at individual junctions (see Table II-4). Agreement was reached during
negotiations that the government will provide the TPD in a timely manner with
the resources, staff and facilities required for operation and maintenance of
police equipment procured under the project.
1/   While the exact specifications of the Government's proposals at not
kcnown at this date, it is vla"siqhle that B 300 million could be "ol-
:Lected annually from a central area pricing scheme under which half
of the non-exempt vehicles elected to pay.

2.16      Traffic a-d Polution Monitoring Equipment.  To permit adequate
monitoring of zr "'' C e    ffiC  as well as to detect noise and air
pollution levels of this traflic, $100 000 will be allocated to cover the
costs of (a) permanent and temporary traffic count stations, (b) equipment
for measuring traffic speeds, and )c) air pollution and noise detection
equipment.  (See also para. 2417)
2.17      Traffic Noise Abatement and Air Pollution Detection.  The traffic
noise level along most arterial streets in Bangkok is much higher than on
streets with coma      2 i eoval s o f traffic in citi4es wh ere reasonable compliance
with noise muffling s--dards has been attained.  The proposed noise control
program, to be enforced by the Traffic Police Division, will involve system-
atic noise monitoring along heavily traveled streets and enforcement prior-
ities assigned to those street links with the highest registered decibel
levels.  It is anticieated that this program can be accomplished at a minimum
of public expense, the burden of costs being directed at offending private
motor vehicle opperators, -'s 7lil be required principally to install adequate
noise mufflers.  This will 'De accomplished by establishing a continuing air

were received tha  sct    proposals mutually agreed between the Government and
the Bank will be iae    e  under the proJect.

2.18     ITrouements i                             in S gnllg.  The project will provide for
coordination of traffic signals at 92 -u-ctions (see Map 13577), upgrading



- 17 -
of existing signals, and the further installation of signals at new inter-
sections. In the core area, new trafic signal controllers will be installed
at 48 junctions and connected to a mini-computer at a traffic control center.
This system will be designed and programmed to achieve optimum signal timings,
and deviations will be monitored at the center for immediate remedial action.
Outside the central area, the requirement for computer control is reduced
because junctions are more widely separated. Here, all traffic controlled
intersections will be coordinated through cableless linking equipment which
also provides for different control plans to be selected automatically by time
of day. In addition, closed-circuit television cameras will be provided at
critical junctions and monitored at the traffic control center to assist the
traffic police to resolve exceptional traffic situations.
2.19      Recognizing the poor visibility and general poor condition of the
existing signal heads, approximately 70 sets of signals will be refitted or
replaced. An additional 20 sets of signals will be installed at new inter-
section locations as part of the junction improvement project element.
2.20      Construction of Road Flyovers.  Flyovers are to be located at
principal road intersections where the greatest person-trip time savings
can be realized after appropriate remedial traffic management procedures
such as changes in signal timing and intersection channelization are accom-
plished at ground level. Seven sites have been selected for inclusion
in the proposed project, as listed below and shown in Map 13578R1: (a)
Phaholyothin/Padipat/Suthisarn; (b) Sukumvit/Rama IV/Soi 71; (c) Sathorn/
Rama IV/Wireless; (d) Dindaeng/Raj Prarop; (e) Raj Withee/Rama VI; (f) Rama
I/Phya Thai; and (g) Sri Ayudhaya/Phya Thai. Flyovers (a) and (b) are at
relatively isolated locations designed to improve particularly congested
outlying road intersections. The remaining five flyovers are considered
as a package of improvements designed to facilitate movement to and around
the central area of Bangkok and will thus facilitate introduction of the area
pricing scheme.
2.21      The basic design standards for road flyovers have been established
by the Public Works Department of the BMA. The majority of the existing
(and proposed) flyovers consist of two-lane carriageways constructed by
laying simply supported precast prestressed beams on reinforced concrete
piers and columns, founded on precast concrete piles.  Although more expen-
sive, there may be a need to substitute steel structures in a few locations
where either (a) traffic disruption time needs to be minimized, or (b) the
potential of removing flyovers to accommodate proposed (but currently not
programmed) elevated rail or mass transit lines remains a distinct future
possibi:Lity.
2.22      Street Improvements.  To add traffic capacity outside the core
area, this component will provide for:
(a)  Selected road widening and related improvements.  A
selective program of street widening will be undertaken
where such widening would meet one or more of the fol-
lowing criteria: (i) facilitating the deployment of



- 18 -
a new bus lane; (ii) permitting the creation of a
needed "standard" traffic lane where such widening
will increase street capacity; and (iii) accommodating
a shift in traffic flows due to the impact of the
area pricing scheme. All such widening should not be
undertaken at the expense of significantly adversely
affecting pedestrian traffic. Pavement specifications
will vary depending on number of heavy axle vehicles
using the roads and will be in accordance with the
standards established by BMA's Public W'orks Department;
(b) junction improvements. The capacity of several junc-
ions could be improved at comparatively low cost. Right
turn movements, both at at-grade intersections and under
existing flyovers, have not always been adequately dealt
with and cause additional conflicts with traffic waiting
to make other movements. The large junctions at Democracy
Monument and Victory Monument (where for aesthetic reasons
flyovers would not be acceptable) will benefit from chan-
nelization schemes. Junction improvements will include:
(i) channelization (especially left turn lanes); (ii) new
signal installations; (iii) repaving; (iv) signing and
striping; and (v) other low to moderate cost measures to
increase junction capacity; and
(c)  street signing and marking.  The project provides for
improving road signing and marking to appropriate
standards along major arterial roads to ensure better
safety and traffic discipline. A standardized sign
and marking system will be developed by the UTPO during
the course of the project and will form the basis for
all future signing and marking in the BMA area.
2.23      Construction of missing road links.  The BMA has recently initiated
a short-term program which calls for the improvement of 49 minor street ("soi")
segments to improve road continuity. Construction of approximately ten such
missing road links, generally less than 1/2 km in length, is included under
the proposed project. The final selection of appropriate links (to be accom-
plished by the end of 1978) will be on the grounds that they will contribute
effectively to the traffic capacity of the main road system, either directly
by introducing effective additional links into the frequently widely spaced
network, or indirectly by providing inter-connections within large traffic
generating areas.
2.24      Specifications for the missing links will be based on standards
established by BMA's Public Works Department. The travel surface will con-
sist of 20 cm thick reinforced concrete and will range in width between 6.0
and 14.0 meters, with typical rights-of-way being 2.0 to 4.0 meters additional
in width. Traffic lane widths will ideally be 3.5 meters, but in some cases
may be reduced to 3.0 meters. For those pavements 6.0 meters or less in width,



- 19 -
a notched gutter section flush with the pavement will be provided; wider pave-
ments will have curbs. During negotiations, assurances were received by the
Government that land and buildings required. for carrying out the project will
be acquired by December 31, 1979.
Improve Public Transport
2.25      Bus Priority Measures.  To improve public transport speeds, this
component will provide for:
(a)  reserved bus lanes (see Map 13579R).  Many of the exist-
ing arterial roads in Bangkok are wide enough to accom-
modate special lanes for buses without severely restricting
other road traffic. The proposed project would provide
for "with - flow" bus lanes--totalling about 100 km--along
heavily congested roads. These bus lanes will be selected
and designed by the UTPO. Bus lanes will be provided along
roads where traffic queues are the longest and the highest
volumes of bus passengers are carried; in general this will
apply to routes with over 100 buses per hour.
(b)  core area bus and pedestrian street priority measures.
There are opportunities within the core area of the
city, where the streets are spaced closer together,
to institute measures giving higher priority to buses
and pedestrians, and lesser priority to private cars.
Under the proposed project, it is anticipated that
these measures will include the narrowing of roadway
widths to permit the widening (or inclusion of) side-
walks, and other special measures such as physical
barriers and special channelization to give buses
priority or exclusive use of selected street segments.
Final design of this project element will be the re-
sponsibility of the UTPO, assisted by the technical
assistance provided under the project;
(c)  extended bus bays.  At present, bus bays are too short,
and buses are forced to queue to reach a single stop. The
project would include about 40 extended bus bays, allowing
dispersal of stops at these bays so that buses with different
destinations will have separate stops. These bays will be
provided in those locations where at least 50, and most
likely over 100, buses stop in one hour; and
(d)  bus shelters.  Recognizing the lack of suitable shelter from
rain and intense sunlight at several heavily used locations
100 bus shelters will be provided as part of the project.

Policy Measures Designed to Discourage The Uneconomic Use
of Low Occupancy Vehicles
2.26      Introduction of Area Pricing.  Even with the placement of new
physical facilities (such as road overpasses), there will still be a lack
of balance between the availability of road capacity and growing traffic
levels. As proved by international experience, additional private cars
will be attracted by the expansion of road capacity, leaving road congestion
much as before, unless effective restraint measures are introduced. The
proposed project will therefore include a scheme that will reduce the demand
for road space by charging low-occupancy vehicles directly for the use of
roads in central Bangkok.
2.27      At this stage of surveying and analysis, it would be premature to be
definite about the details of the area pricing scheme to be adopted. However,
the Government and Bank missions have jointly developed a set of specifica-
tions and guidelines to serve as the starting poirit for detailed technical
investigations. The specifications assume that a Singapore or cordon type
proposal will emerge as the preferred option; this may not be the case, how-
ever, and at this stage it is essential to remain flexible. The specifica-
tions may be modified as technical studies proceed and as local realities
become more fully understood. However, the Government has accepted the
principle of area pricing (which it prefers to call "traffic restraint"),
to be introduced not later than by December 31, 1980. By that time, most
other project measures would have been carried out, other related road proj-
ects such as the Sathorn Road and Bridge extension, the new tollroad, and
parts of the middle ring road will have been completed; and public transport
in Bangkok would be geared to absorb much of the modal shift stimulated by
area pricing. Whatever area pricing system is finally chosen, some physical
investments will be needed, including (a) clear and distinctive traffic
signs, (b) physical traffic divertors and other traffic management oriented
civil works, and (c) license sales outlets. Most signing would be on the
approach routes to the zone, and most physical divertors would be at or
near the zone boundaries to manage traffic (see Map 13578R1). Not later than
June 30, 1979, proposals for an area pricing scheme will be prepared in
detail by the National Traffic Board (NTB) and sent to the Bank for review
and comment. During negotiations, assurances were received that an area
pricing scheme mutually agreed between the Government and the Bank be intro-
duced by December 31, 1980.
2.28      Parking Controls.  At present, there are approximately 38,400
parking spaces in central Bangkok (see Table II-5). Approximately 14,600
spaces (38% of the total) are off-street governmental or private spaces not
available to the general public. Among the remaining 23,800 spaces, only
9%, or about 2,000, are price regulated. Demand for, and occupancy of,
available spaces varies considerably within the central area.

2.29      The Government has tentatively established a number of parking
policy measures designed to: (a) discourage long-term commuter parking;
(b) itiprove the convenience of existing parking spaces for short term parking;
and (c) increase the traffic capacity of arterial streets. More specifically
these policy measures will be accomplished by:
(a)  institution of parking charges on a higher percentage
of on-street spaces as a means of discouraging uneconomic
use of street-space. As an approximate guideline, those
areas within which 85% or more parking spaces are occupied
during prime business hours will be priced to bring about
an 85% utilization;
(b)  increasing on-street parking charges to discourage
long term "commuter" parking and to improve availability
of parking spaces for short term "convenience" parking;
(c)  improvement in the enforcement of parking regulations to
ensure better usage of existing parking spaces and to in-
crease parking revenues. These improvements will be achieved
by stiff penalties and a graduated increase in fines;
(d)  increased use of parking attendants as a means of generating
employment and improving collections. It is expected that
an attendant parking system could become more effective
than parking meters which have proved to be unsuccesful in
Bangkok. In addition, this could provide useful employment.
As an example, at a ratio of one attendant per 20 spaces,
over 1,000 parking attendants would be needed; and
(e) removal of on-street parking where such parking reduces the
traffic-carrying capacity of arterial streets.



- 22 -
2.30      A scheme for parking controls, including a time schedule for
implementation, will be prepared in detail by the NTB and sent to the Bank
for review and comment as part of the proposals submitted by end June 1979.
During negotiations, assurances were received that such a scheme mutually
agreed between the Government and the Bank will be implemented under the
project.
2.31      Staggering of Working and School Hours.  Surveys show that at least
90% of governmental offices located in the central area have official work
hours beginning between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. and terminating between 4:30 and
5:00 p.m.  This concentration of work oriented travel is exacerbated by
heavy concentrations of school travel, particularly by public transit during
much of the same time period. A program of staggered working and school hours
would spread bus loadings, which would improve comfort and reduce delays for
bus passengers, and might also delay the need to increase the bus fleet size
as transport demand increases. Accordingly the government will introduce a
formal staggered work and school hour plan for all public offices and schools
beginning in the central area, and will seek similar commitments from large
private concerns and private schools in the same area. By June 30, 1979, a
scheme for introduction of staggered working and school hours, including a
time schedule for implementation, will be prepared in detail by the NTB and
sent to the Bank for review and comment. During negotiations, assurances
were received that such a scheme mutually agreed between the Government and
the Bank will be implemented under the project.
Technical Assistance and Training
2.32      The UTPO.  This organization will require assistance in its admin-
istration and development as well as in the detailed design of the identified
policy and physical project packages. The project will entail about 120 ex-
pert-months of technical assistance over a four-year period to address these
needs.
2.33      In the area of administration and management, the assistance will
focus on the development of technical procedures, and data collection, for
analysis, design and evaluation of traffic schemes both under the proposed
project and for general traffic matters in Bangkok and other urban areas in
Thailand. Further, the consultants will advise UTPO on policies and measures
concerning taxi, minibus and other "informal" public transport to ensure that
their standards and fares reflect the demands of the travelling public. In
addition, the role of mini-buses in Bangkok will be evaluated and a strategic
plan developed by the UTPO and the consultants for early implementation by
the Government. Finally, professional and technical staff training in traffic
matters will be provided so that UTPO can increasingly carry out traffic
engineering work by its own staff. At the end of the four-year period, a
completely staffed UTPO would be fully competent to continue this work on
its own. During negotiations, agreement was reached that UTPO will implement
a staff training program in traffic engineering and traffic control mutually
agreed between the government and the Bank.

2.34      Most of the monitoring of project impacts will be undertaken by
the Asian Institute of Technology under contract with the U.K. Transport and
Road! ReSearch Laboratory using British Ministry of Overseas Development funds.
However, it is anticipated that an additional 8 expert-months of technical
assistance will be required to augment this work as well as to set up a con-
tinuing traffic monitoring program within the UTPO. (See also paras. 4.09,
4.10.)
2.35      The BMTA.  The project will provide about 75 expert-months of
technical assistance to BMTA over a 15-month period. In addition approximately
$20,000 equivalent will be earmarked for special training of BMTA staff. A
Steering Committee will be established by the Ministry of Communications to
supervise this assistance, which will be carried out by a Task Force headed by
BMTA's Chief Executive Officer. The Task Force, including experts in traffic
operations, maintenance and materials management, and finance and accounting,
will review BMTA's present operations, identify areas requiring special study,
and prepare preliminary reports for consideration by the Steering Committee.
Agreed recommendations will be implemented and supervised by the Task Force,
assisted by the consultants. While the technical assistance will cover almost
all aspects of BMTA and its operations, special focus will be on traffic
operati.ons, including rationalization of routes and schedules, management and
management information systems, and establishment of a long-term financial
policy   During negotiations, assurances were received that recommendations
mutually accepted between the Government and the Bank will be implemented
by BMTA.
2.36      The TPD.  The reorganized and strengthened Traffic Police Division
needs 1:raining to cope with its responsibilities for managing actuated traffic
controL and law enforcement activities under the project. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that the TPD will implement such a training program
mutually agreed upon between the government and the Bank.
2.37      The UTPO:  Public Relations Assistance.  Recognizing the pioneering
and potentially controversial nature of the traffic restraint aspects of the
project, the UTPO will receive approximately six expert-months of technical
assistance to advise the general public on the purpose of measures to be
implemented and the procedures to be followed in their implementation.
2.38      Eastern Seaboard amd National Secondary Cities Development Study.
The Government will receive approximately 100 expert-months of technical
assistance spread over a two-year period to prepare regional cities develop-
ment projects designed to encourage development outside Bangkok and thus
reduces the urbanization pressure on this primate city. The primary emphasis
will be on urban development of the Eastern Seaboard (see Annex 1). During
negotiations agreement was reached in principle on draft terms of reference
for the study.

III.  EXECUTING AGENCIES ANiD PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. Project Organization and Management
3.01      The U-JPO will be the Government agency responsible for coordination
of project implementation. It will be supported by a Project Executive Com-
mittee, chaired by the Minister of Interior and comprised of representatives
of involved agencies, that will have the authority to make decisions required
to expedite project implementation.  The UTPO will review all project-related
proposals by the BMA and the TPD before furnishing such proposals for Bank
review. As is mentioned in para. 3.06, BMA wil:L execute all civil works under
the project to be financed by the Government and the Bank.  During negotia-
tions, the government agreed to a division of responsibilities among project
executing agencies as set out in Table III-1.
B. The Urban Transportation Planning Office
3.02      The UTPO currently operates within the Office of Policy and Planning
which is located within the Ministry of the Interior, but additionally acts
as the secretariat to the National Traffic Board (NTB) which reports directly
to the Cabinet. This arrangement, while adequate for the purposes of carrying
out the project is not formally imbedded in Thai legislation. The Cabinet
recently submitted to the National Assembly a draft Act on the "Systematiza-
tion of National Traffic". Under this law the NTB would become the "Committee
for the Systematization of National Traffic" and the UTPO would become this
committee's secretariat and would be called the "Office of the Committee for
the systematization of National Traffic". This proposed legislation in
essence will formalize the existing arrangement.
3.03      The current staff of the UTPO, numbering about 80, is undertrained
and lacks the qualifications and experience to carry out the project which
will require sophisticated planning, design, and management. The UTPO will
eventually require a staff of approximately 200 and will take some time to
reach full capacity; it is important, however, to fill key posts early in the
project cycle to assure smooth project performance.  As further described in
paras 2.32 and 2.33, extensive technical assistance to the UTPO over a three-
year period is a key project element. During negotiations, assurances were
received on minimum professional staff requirements at UTPO as indicated in
Annex 2.
3.04      As the UTPO improves its staff it will be organized in four divisions,
(1) transportation planning, (2) traffic engineering, (3) traffic control (in
Bangkok), and (4) administration (see Chart III--2). The traffic engineering
division, focussing only on Bangkok during the f-irst year, will be responsible
for data collection, analysis, traffic engineering design, functional speci-
fications and monitoring related to the proposed project. Final designs,
preparation of bid documents, supervision of construction, and maintenance of

completed works will be undertaken by BMA with traffic specifications prepared
by UTPO. Through its traffic control division, the UTPO will be directly
responsible for specifying, ordering and maintaining the traffic signal system
and the television camera system, and for overalL supervision responsibility
of traffic control center operations.
C. The Traffic Police Division
3.05      The Traffic Police Division (TPD) will inter-alia be responsible for
day-to-day operation of the traffic control center and directing mobile patrols
to resolve urgent problems. The Division will also continue to be responsible
for traffic law enforcement, including enforcement of parking and road pricing
regulations, even though certain functions (such as removal of vehicles and
collection of monies owed) may be delegated to non-police personnel. At pre-
sent, the Bangkok Police design certain traffic imanagement schemes, but this
will in the future be the sole responsibility of the UTPO.
D. The BMA Public Works Department
3.06      The organization and management of the Public Works Department of
BMA, which is responsible for all civil works under the proposed project,
has been thoroughly appraised. It has a total staff of about 2,200 (150
engineers) and is organized into six divisions: Design, Building and Repair,
Construction Control, Building Control, Land Management and Public Land, and
a Secretariat. The Department is doing a substantial amount of work, and is
capable of designing and constructing major works such as concrete or steel
flyovers, road works, bridges and drainage. Contractors have often been used
for major construction works in the past, and the Department has undertaken
supervision in a satisfactory manner.  The Department is fully competent to
undertake the tasks assigned to it under the proposed project.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
4.01      The project would be implemented over a 3 year period (1978-81),
as shown in Table IV-1. Equipment procurement and installation under the
project would be completed by July 1980, and civil works related to physical
components would be completed by January 1981. All policy measures would be
implemented by December 1980.
B. Procurement
4.02      Contracts for equipment totalling about: $1.5 million will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. A margin of preference equal to 15% or the customs duty,
whichever is lower, would be granted to local manufacturers. Smaller equip-
ment contracts totalling about $500,000 equivalent, which would not be
attractive to foreign bidders, will be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally. Approximately $1.7 million worth of traffic
signal equipment is recommended.for sole source procurement (see para 4.03).
4.03      The Government signed, on June 28, 1978, a contract with Traffic
Engineering Systems (TES) Ltd., a Thai company associated with GEC-Elliot
Traffic Automation, U.K., for procurement and installation of a traffic con-
trol system in Bangkok. The contract, estimated total value $1.7 million
provides for completed installation by June 1979. This contract has not been
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, but based on a
proposal by GEC, who have supplied and installed almost all existing traffic
signals in Bangkok. The appraisal mission has carefully reviewed the contract
and has concluded that the equipment offered is appropriate for the required
system and that the foreign exchange component of the contract (corresponding to
about $0.9 million) is reasonable for the equipment offered. The Government
committee that negotiated the contract is satisfied that the local cost por-
tion of the contract is reasonable. By awarding this negotiated contract, the
Government will achieve the principal advantage of time saving of up to two
years, due to the complexity of drawing up detailed but fair specifications.
4.04      It should be noted that in addition to the above traffic signal
control system, modernization of about 70 existing signalized intersections
and about 20 new signal installations at intersections currently not served
and located outside the central area of Bangkok, would also be part of the
proposed project. This equipment is estimated to cost about $0.8 million.
Procurement of this equipment is less urgent and, consequently, the Government
intends to award the corresponding contract on the basis of international
competitive bidding, in accordance with procedures consistent with those of
the "Guidelines."
4.05      In view of the above circumstances, it is recommended that the
Bank finance the foreign exchange component of the TES contract, estimated

at about $0.9 million equivalent, and retroactively finance such costs in-
curred prior to Loan signirg (see para 4.07).
4.06       Civil works contracts for flyovers, with an estimated total value
about $10.5 million equivalent, will be awarded under international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. All other civil works,
total estimated value about $7 million equivalent, are too small and diverse
to interest foreign contractors. These contracts would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally under procedures acceptable
to the Bank.
C. Disbursement
4.07      The proposed loan would be disbursed for 40% of the cost of civil
works, 100% of foreign expenditures of directly imported equipment (traffic
signalling, police and pollution monitoring equipment) and vehicles, 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured items and 65% for
other locally procured items, and 100% of total expenditures for consulting
services, technical assistance and training. In view of the urgency of the
project, the Government has already incurred expenditures exceeding $1 million
equivalent on project related activities. Retroactive financing is therefore
proposed from June 1, 1978 in an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent
of $1.75 million including the cost of technical assistance, procurement of
equipment, and civil works. Bank disbursements are expected to be completed
by September 30, 1982. The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is given
in Table IV-2.

D. Accounts, Audit and Progress Reports
4.08      Separate project accounts will be maintained by each implementing
agency, and a comprehensive project account by the UTPO. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Government will (a) maintain in the
Ministry of Interior separate accounting records, and a separate bank account
for all project revenues and expenditures, and (b) have the project accounts
audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. Assurances
were also obtained at negotiations that quarterly progress reports will be
preparedl by UTPO and furnished to the Bank, focussing on, among other things,
the policy, physical, contractual and financial progress of the project in-
cluding project performance relative to key performance indicators (see para.
4.11).
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.09      Monitoring of key transport characteristics is included in the
project to enable the authorities to assess the success of the transport
improvement measures. The UTPO is to be the agency responsible for setting
up the monitoring program, which is to include at least the following meas-
urements: (a) traffic speeds and flows along street links improved as part
of the project and also, on a sample basis, at other points on the road
network; (b) bus and car occupancy, on a sample basis; (c) regular measure-
ments of door-to-door journey speeds by bus and car, on a sample basis; (d)
pollution and noise levels, on a sample basis; and (e) measurements by means
of sample household surveys of travel characteristics of different income
groups,, including daily distance travelled, number of trips, and total time
and money spent on travel.
4.10      Assistance in the monitoring process is to be provided by the U.K.
Transport and Road Research Laboratory and the Transportation Engineering
Department of the Asian Institute of Technology under the over-all guidance
of the UTPO.
4.11      Performance Indicators.  The performance indicators as listed in
Table IV-3 will serve as the basis for quantitatively evaluating progress
towards the objectives of the proposed project. Emphasis will be placed on
rigorous testing of comparative sample locations under (a) existing and (b)
project completion conditions.
F. Supervision
4.12      The UTPO will supervise the project on behalf of the Government.
Since the Office is still being developed, and since the project will contain
several novel features, close monitoring and supervision will be provided by
the Bank. About 35 staff-weeks of Bank supervision will be required during
the first year, and about 50 staff-weeks during the following 24 months.

1.   Increase travel speeds            Increase private vehicle speeds 25% and
bus speeds 40+% on principal arterials
in city's central area.
2.   Reduce intersection delays        At intersections with flyovers, traffic
at flyover locations              delays should be reduced 20%.
3.   Reduce peak hour bus over-        Reduce number of buses with severe over-
loading                           crowding (beyond rated standing capacity)
during peak travel hours.
4.   Increase car occupancy            Increase car occupancy within proposed
area pricing zone by 20%.
S.   Maintain or increase person       While increasing travel speeds and
trips into central area of        decreasing bus overloading, the number of
city                              person trips into and within the central
area should at least remain constant.
6.   Increase public transit           Increase the public transit modal share
share of central area travel    of peak hour travel into the central area
by 15%.
7.   Reduce travel noise               Reduce noise levels on arterial streets
to accepted decibel (dB) level standards.
8.   Improve parking efficiency        Regulate by price mechanism those on-
street spaces with 85% or higher occupancy.

V .  UIPACT AND ECONOMIlC ANALYSIS
A.  Ex pected Impact
5.01       The purpose of the proposed project is to increase mobility in Bangkok
by: (a) traffic management methods to increase efficiency in the use of exist-
ing roads and vehicles; and (b) selective physical investments, particularly
at road intersections, to increase the capacity of the road network.
5.02       The best estimates of likely travel characteristics in the Bangkok
area irt 1972, 1978 and 1981 -- the first year after expected project comple-
tion --- are shown in Table V-1. The 1972 data are based on the results of
the Bangkok Transportation Study, and 1978 data on mission estimates.  Three
separate estimates are given for 1981:
(a) on the assumption that the proposed project would not be
implemented; that 1972 transport. policies would be con-
tinued; and that the road network would be as at present,
with the addition of such improvements (e.g. the Din Daeng/
Port toll road and the Sathorn Bridge and road extension)
which are already committed;
(b)  on the assumption that only the traffic management elements
of the proposed project would be implemented, (e.g. the bus
lanes and road pricing) but not its physical elements
(e.g. the flyovers, road widening and signal improve-
ments); and
(c) on the assumption that tne complete project will be
implemented before 1981.
The 1981 estimates are based on relationships between network capacity,
traffic flows and traffic speeds, and from population travel characteristics,
that were developed from the 1972 data. They form the numerical basis of the
economic evaluation, which assesses the costs and benefits associated with the
(a) traffic management measures above and, (b) the additional benefits and
costs due to the physical components, assuming prior implementation of the
management measures.
Summary of Expected Travel Impacts
5.03       As a result of the projectL   (a) travel speeds within and adjacent
to the core area are likely to increase substantially; 10-40% increases are
expected, depending upon the exact road link and location; (b) the increased
travel speeds would bring about savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and
time, especially to the 80% of population who depend on buses for their
mechanized transport; (c) the savings in time and VOC would generate more

travel, especially by public transport; (d) the area pricing scheme is ex-
pected t:o eliminate some private car travel, with consequent loss to the
individuals concerned. These losses would be more than offset by improved
travel conditions to the traffic remaining; (e) the shift from low-occupancy
to high--occupancy vehicles, combined with increased travel speeds, is expected
to increase the person-trip capacity of the roads leading into the core area
of the city; this in turn should increase the development potential of the
core area; (f) the increased travel speeds and increased person-trip capacity
of the road system could defer for some time additional major capital invest-
ments in the road network as well as investments in a rapid transit system
on separate rights-of-way; (g) the reduction in private motor vehicle
traffic is expected to have positive environmental implications principally
through the reduction of air and noise pollution.
B. Evaluation of Costs and Benefits
5.04      The economic analysis consists of a comparison of project costs with
the expected benefits due to (a) net savings in time and vehicle operating
costs IVOC) (b) modal shifts and (c) increased travel. The effects of land-
use changes, environmental improvements, and safety improvements are noted but
not quantified. Economic rates of return are estimated on the basis of an
assumed 10-year life of project components. The effects of the different
components are assumed to be additive, i.e. the benefits from each are assumed
independent of the implementation of the others.
Evaluation of Costs
5.05      The Economic Costs of the project include (a) the initial investment
costs and (b) annual implementation costs. The initial investment costs
include all project costs indicated in Table II-1, with the exception of price
contingencies, taxes and technical assistance for secondary cities. Those
expenditures for which direct economic benefits which cannot be readily cal-
culated (such as bus shelters) have been allocated to those project components
which are most likely to benefit from the expenditures (such as bus lanes).
Annual. implementation costs are estimated in those cases where substantial
additional staff time will be needed; this includes the area pricing and bus
lane components. The costs of staff for increased parking control are not
included as the revenues generated from the scheme are expected to substanti-
ally exceed the staffing costs and are not included in the estimated project
benefits.
Evaluation of Benefits
5.06      Savings in VOC.  Use-related VOC at different speeds are based on
the Bangkok Transportation Study and updated to 1975. All vehicle costs,
except half of depreciation, are assumed to be use-related, and are tabulated
in Table V-2 net of taxes. The vehicles for which the figures are given are:
A 100 cc motorcycle; a 1,600 cc car; a 300 cc Samlor; a 6,400 cc bus; a 4,300
cc light truck; and a 6 100 cc heavy truck. In the evaluation, the VOC of
minibuses and commerciai vehicles are assumed to be those of "light trucks."

5.07      Savings in Time Costs.  The "value of time" -- the extent to which
people are willing to trade time for money -- is a behavioral characteristic
strongly influenced by income. Working time is valued at the wage rates,
assumed to be B 30 per hour for wage-earning car and taxi passengers, B 20
for motorcycle riders, and B 10 for wage-earning bus occupants. Non-working
travel time is valued at one-third of wage rates, and this rate is applied to
all travelers whether wage earners or not.
5.08      Benefits from Area Pricing.  The levying of charges for the use of
congested road space in Bangkok is expected to eliminate about a quarter
of private car traffic in congested areas and to increase the speeds of
remaining traffic by a similar percentage, with bus speeds, and travel speeds
into the core area, showing particularly marked improvements. The increase in
bus speeds will increase the capacity of the existing bus fleet, but much of
this increased capacity is likely to be taken up by additional bus travel
generated by the higher speed. Half of the private trips displaced are
expected to shift to buses or minibuses; a quarter to car pools; and a quarter
to change destination or time of day, or to be lost. The gains and losses are
classified as follows:
(a)  all bus passengers gain from higher bus speeds, provided
sufficient bus capacity is available for the additional bus
traffic that is expected to be (i) newly generated by the
higher speed and, (ii) transferred from private transport;
(b) car passengers who transfer to buses will pay less, as
bus fares are cheaper than private transport. They are



- 37 -
however expected to suffer time losses, which are offset
in the evaluation against the time savings gained by
car passengers who do not transfer;
(c)  car passengers who pay the increased fee and remain in
their vehicles will save both t:Lme and VOC in consequence
of the higher speed. The area pricing fee will be a loss
to them, but a gain of equivalent amount to the public
revenue, and is therefore excluded from the general
evaluation;
(d)  car passengers who change destinations or journey times,
or who abandon trips, are assumed to suffer on the average
can economic loss equivalent to half the area pricing fee.
5.09      Benefits from Bus Priority Measures.  The provision of special bus
lanes will increase bus vehicle speeds by reducing delays at intersection
queues and only nominally decreasing non-bus vehicle speeds, resulting in net
time Savings and VOC gains.  Given that most person-trips (approximately 60%)
are by bus, but most vehicle-miles are by non-buses, most benefits due to bus
lanes will be time savings as opposed to VOC savings.
5.10      Benefits from Traffic Signal Equipment.  The coordination or traffic
signals was conservatively estimated to result in travel speed increases of
5% over the affected area. Both travel time and VOC savings for all vehicles
are expected.
5.11      Benefits from Flyovers.  The proposed flyovers are estimated to
greatly reduce delays at junctions for that proportion of the traffic stream
removed by grade separation from the junction. The remaining traffic was
estimated to benefit as well, but by a lesser amount by virtue of less
trafiic being accommodated at the intersections.
5.12      Benefits from Missing Road Links.  Given the wide spacing of the
Banglcok road system, the construction of missing links is expected to reduce
vehicle miles of travel which, in turn, will result in travel time and VOC
savin-gs.
5.13      Benefits from Other Road Improvements.  Selected junction improve-
ments, street widening, and new traffic signal installations at high priority
locations are all expected to increase operating speeds and reduce delays of
both public and private vehicles.
5.14      Calculation of Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  Each project com-
ponent is conservatively assumed to have a ten-year life. In that period
inccmes are expected to continue rising, and so is car ownership. Bus rider-
ship is also likely to increase, so long as the public transport industry is
allowed to provide high-quality services for those who are prepared to pay
for comfort, as well as low-cost services for those who are not. It may be
conservatively assumed that savings in vehicle operating costs will grow at



- 38 -
least in proportion to the increases in the vehicle population, say 8% per
year, and that benefits from time savings will, additionally, grow at least in
proportion to income growth, say 4% per year. Annual project implementation
costs, which principally includes labor oriented traffic enforcement costs
are estimated to increase 4% per year.
5.15      On the basis of the above considerations, of the initial and oper-
ating costs of the different project elements, and of the assumed unit savings
in time and VOC, the project benefits in the first full year of each element,
and the ERRs, are summarized in Table V-3. As is shown, the total first-year
benefits are estimated at B 722 million ($36 million), or approximately 135%
of estimated project costs. If benefits from just the physical components
(excluding area pricing and bus lanes) are compared with their costs, the
first year returns are 48% of costs.
C. Distribution of Benefits
5.16      The proposed project, by increasing efficiency in the use of the
road system, is expected to benefit all classes of road users except certain
private car travellers. This group may become worse off by being priced out
of some journeys. The main benefits will accrue to those who use buses,
minibuses, shared cars, and other modes that are economic in road use.
Operators of public transport (buses, minibuses, taxis) and of commercial
vehicles are also expected to benefit. Many of the benefits may be passed
on: for example, reductions in operating costs could result in more frequent,
or less costly, bus services.
5.17      The initial distribution of benefits as between bus travellers, car
travellers (including taxi passengers), public transport operators and commer-
cial vehicle operators is shown, for each project component, in Table V-4.
D. Sensivitity Analysis
5.18      The most doubtful elements in the economic evaluation are the value
of time and the rate of growth of benefits. Table V-5 shows the likely ERR
for the whole project in the event that savings in non-working time are (i)
valued at only one-sixth of wage rates, and (ii) ignored. The possibility
of only half the growth in benefits materializing is also considered, (i) on
its own, and (ii) in conjunction with the reduced valuations of time savings.

-B 30 million; parking revenues reflecting more economic -ee of street spaces are expected to exceed these costs substantially.
;k) Rate of return based on no dependence on other pro ject elements; mre conservatively, it is estimated that approximately 1/4 of Traffic S1ignal System, Road
Flyovers , and Road Capacity Investments should be in place before aere pricing schenme can be safely implemented. Assuming these costs the ERR for
area pricing would be approximately 290°.

E. Impact on the Urban Poor
5.19      All income groups are expected to benefit from the project by means
of (a) increased travel speeds, (b) improved person-trip capacity of the
transport system, and (c) improved envirormental conditions. However, these
benefits are expected to be obtained using a key project strategy aimed at
the discouragement of low occupancy vehicLes (principally cars) and the
encouragement of high occupancy vehicles (principally buses). Thus, the pro-
ject is expected to provide relatively few benefits to the high income groups
(approximately the upper 10%) and relatively more to the lower income groups
who cannot afford a car, but can afford public transport.
5.20      Since the Bangkok bus fare is still low, even by LDC standards, it
is estimated that all but a small fraction of the urban poor have the means to
benef:Lt from the proposed improvements in public transport service. As is
shown in Table V-6, a family at the 10th income percentile would only have to
devote 5-7% of its income for two bus rides daily--the amount needed to send
one family member on a commute to work. Even double this amount of bus travel
would not appear prohibitively costly for this income group.

/1   See Table I-1.
72   Assumes 20 days/month, 2 trips/day.
/3   The present Bangkok bus fare is B 1.0 per route, and a full additional
fare is charged for each transfer. According to BMTA, there is a daily
average of 1.4 transfers per passenger in each direction.



- 42 -
5.21      Beyond considerations of affordability, the regular bus system pro-
vides reasonably good coverage to the scattered slum settlements in Bangkok,
ensuring that the benefits of improved service will reach the poor. Only in
a few instances does the average walking distance to the nearest bus stop ex-
ceed 1 km, and in most cases the distance is less than 500 meters. In many
cases, minibus service on flexible route patterns services those areas away
from regular bus routes.
5.22      Determination of the share of project benefits that reach the urban
poor of Bangkok is heavily dependent upon what definition of "urban poor" is
used. The "absolute poverty" level in Bangkok is only 9% of the population
while the "relative poverty" level ranges up to 15%. These calculated per-
centages are among the lowest of LDCs, with more common ranges of relative
urban poor being 25-40% of the population for nations in similar GNP ranges.
5.23      Conservatively assuming that the lower 5% of the population profile
cannot easily afford bus services, that the top 10% of the population does
not regularly ride buses, that the 15th percentile income level is the rela-
tive poverty level for Bangkok, and that only bus service improvements would
assist the urban poor (see Table V-4), then only 7% of project benefits
would reach the poor. Assuming a more liberal urban poverty threshold at
the 33rd income percentile, 13% of project benefits would go to the poor.
5.24      Notwithstanding the relatively small percentage of project benefits
directed at the "poor," they will enjoy a high rate of return on project
costs. Considering the substantial economic rates of return estimated for the
project, the investment could be justified solely on the basis of benefits to
the relatively poor population of Bangkok. For example, counting only benefits
accruing to the lower 50% of the population, the economic rate of return on
the whole project cost would be 20%; the economic rate of return counting only
the lower 33% of the population would be 13%; and the rate counting only the
lower 15% of the population would be 7%.
5.25      Other direct or indirect project benefits to the urban poor would
be as follows: (a) public transit technical assistance which should improve
the bus routing (para 2.35), and (b) a monitoring component which includes a
survey of travel characteristics of different income groups, including number
of trips and total time and money spent on travel; this survey will provide a
better understanding of travel habits of the poor and enable bus services and
other transport improvement measures to be planned for their benefit, particu-
larly with a view to increasing access to employment opportunities (para 4.09).
F. Risks and Uncertainties
5.26      The proposed area pricing for Bangkok--being considered on price
restraints on traffic for the entire working day (aLt least 10 hours) over a
wide area (as much as 20 sq. km.)--is without precedent anywhere. Only
Singapore has implemented an area-wide traffic restraint scheme and this



- 43 -
only for a 6 sq. km. area over a limited time period (approximately 3 hours)
each day. The risks are principally ones of enforcement and political accept-
ability. There are also attendant technical and economic impact risks asso-
ciated with such a new approach to traffic management. While these risks must
be viewed as being considerable, the potential payoffs are viewed to be very
high. Even if area pricing were not applied, potential project payoffs would
be substantial; with area pricing pricing restraining the uneconomic use of
low occupancy vehicles, the benefits will be exceptionally large.

VI.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following points:
(a) role of various public transport modes (para 1.15);
(b)  timely allocation by Government of project funds to
allow expenditious project implementation (para 2.09);
(c) resources, staff and facilities for operation and main-
tenance of police equipment (para 2.15);
(d) submission of policy proposals by June 30, 1979, and
timing of their implementation (paras 2.17, 2.27, 2.30,
2.31);
(e) acquisition of land and buildings (para 2.24);
(f) staff training programs for UTPO and TPD (paras 2.33
and 2.36);
(g) implementation by BMTA of mutually agreed upon recom-
mendations (para 2.35);
(h) terms of reference (in principle) for an Eastern
Seaboard Regional Planning Study (para 2.38);
(i)  distribution of responsibilities between executing
agencies (para 3.01);
(j) staffing of UTPO (para 3.03); and
(k) accounts, audit and progress report (para 4.08).
6.02      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$16 million equivalent.

BANGKOK TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: EASTERN SEABOARD
AND NATIONAL SECONDARY CITIES DEVELOPMENT STUDY
1.        It is Government policy to decentralize urban development in
Thailand. The Fourth Development Plan (1977-81) designates nine provinces
(Chiang 'Aai, Chonburi, Khon Kaen, Nakon Ratchasima, Phitsanulok, Phuket,
Songkhla-Hat Yai, Ubon Ratchathani and Udon Thani) for promotion as regional
urban centers, but an explicit strategy for promoting these centers has not
been formulated. The Basic Economic Report and a supporting Urban Sector
Annex concur with the importance of decentralizing urban development, but
argue that the initial effort should be focused on a few cities with strong
economic potential. The eastern seaboard corridor, Songkhla-Hat Yai and,
to a lesser extent, Chiang Mai and either Nakon Ratchasima or Khon Kaen
have been identified as the most attractive cities on these grounds.
2.        The Technical Assistance component of the proposed project includes
US$720,()00 for an Eastern Seaboard and National Secondary Cities Development
Study. This estimate is based on about 100 man-months of technical assistance;
the consultants would work with a team of Thai counterparts under the direction
of a subcommittee of the Cabinet-appointed Eastern Regional Development Commit-
tee. About 85% of the study effort-would be devoted to planning the urban-
industrial development of the eastern seaboard corridor (from Chonburi to
Sattahip and Rayong). The study would analyze alternative patterns of re-
gional development and prepare proposals for the urban infrastructure of the
first phase of the preferred strategy.  The study would also formulate a more
detailed strategy for the promotion of other secondary cities and identify
initial projects.
3.        During negotiations agreement was reached in principle on draft
terms of reference for the study.
