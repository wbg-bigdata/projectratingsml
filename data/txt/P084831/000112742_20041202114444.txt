PREAMBLE

The Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund ("BEEF" or "the Fund") is a legal entity established in

accordance with Chapter 4, Section I of the Energy Efficiency Act ("EEA"). The Fund manages

the financial resources received by the Republic of Bulgaria from the Global Environmental

Fund ("GEF") through the International Bank for Reconstruction and development ("IBRD").

The primary institutional sponsor of BEEF and the official recipient of the GEF grant is the

Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources ("MEER").

BEEF is an independent legal entity, separate from any governmental agency or institution, and

performs its activity in accordance with the EEA, the current legislation framework and the

agreements with the major donors. BEEF is structured as a self-sustainable commercial entity

that concentrates its efforts on facilitating energy efficiency ("EE") investments and on

promoting the development of a working EE market in Bulgaria. To this end, the Fund supports

the identification, development and financing of viable EE projects, resulting in substantial

reduction of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), which is its main environmental objective.

This Operations Manual ("OM") provides the general framework of BEEF's operations,

including details on its governance structure, investment policy, financial products, project cycle

and financial management system ("FMS"). It is designed to give broad guidelines on the above

areas and is not meant to be a comprehensive rulebook. Its goal is to create a common

understanding of BEEF's principles and practice for all stakeholders involved. Its content has to

be considered in the context of the Regulation on the Operation Organization and the Activities

of the Energy Efficiency Fund ("the Legal Statute").

The Operations Manual is a living document and should be updated when required. Its contents,

including its Appendices, cannot be modified or set aside without the explicit approval of the

World Bank ("WB"), following the recommendation of the BEEF Management Board ("MB").




                                                                                                 6

1.1   Major Objectives

The main objectives of BEEF are to facilitate EE sector investments and to promote the

development of an EE market in Bulgaria. The Fund accomplishes these objectives through the

development and implementation of financially profitable EE projects, which can provide

sustainable and increasing energy savings and GHGs emissions reductions.

1.2   Principles of Operation

BEEF is a revolving mechanism for the development and financing of commercially viable

projects and capacity-building support. In conducting its activity, the Fund is governed by the

following major principles:

    - Public-private partnership;

    - Independent and autonomous legal entity;

    - Self-financing operation;

    - Profit-oriented commercial activity;

    - Transparency in administration of financial resources;

    - Equal opportunity for all applicants for financing;

    - Significant GHGs reduction through energy savings.

1.3   Sources of Finance

The sources of finance that BEEF utilises for its activities are as follows:

    - Donations from the Bulgarian and foreign governments, international financial

       institutions, international funds, Bulgarian and foreign legal entities and individuals;

    - Financial income consisting of interest income from current accounts or bank deposits

       opened by BEEF;

    - Loans or other credit facilities from international organizations and banks, as well as

       from legal entities and individuals, which have been granted exclusively for the purpose

       of achieving the Fund's goals;

    - Other income in compliance with BEEF's nature and activity.




                                                                                                7

2.2   The Donors Assembly

2.2.1 Primary donor groups

BEEF is funded by four primary sources, as follows:

        - GEF;

        - The Government of Bulgaria ("GoB");

        - Other bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors;

        - Private sector donations and contributions.

Private sector donations are made by professional associations and organizations (e.g.

municipalities and industrial chambers/associations), corporate entities and individuals that want

to participate in the initial formation of the seed capital.

Subsequent fund collection campaigns are held at least once every two years and are organized

by the MB of BEEF. Details on the procedures and organization of such rounds are provided in

Article 25 of the Legal Statute of BEEF.

2.2.2 DA responsibilities

Members of the DA are individuals, corporate entities, governments, non-governmental

organizations ("NGOs"), municipalities, associations and financial institutions that have

participated with donations and contributions in the seed capital of BEEF.

For every BGN 1,000 of funds provided, the contributors receive the right to one vote. The

voting rights are registered via certificates, issued by the Chairman of the MB.          Further

procedural details on the fund raising mechanism are presented in Article 25 of the Legal

Statute.

The DA convenes at regular sessions every two years. Non-regular sessions may be summoned

under extraordinary circumstances. Sessions are initiated at the request of the MB Chairman or

at the discretion of at least 5% of the voting members.

The main responsibilities of the DA include: (i) election of the private-sector members of the

MB; and (ii) adoption and amendment of the Rules governing the DA's activity. The MB

selection process is detailed later in this chapter.

Decisions and rulings of the DA are enforced with qualifying majority vote of 2/3.




                                                                                                9

   entities that have provided donations to BEEF with the following profile and characteristics:

         o      Two experts with higher education in economics and with sufficient experience

                in project financing in the energy sector;

         o      One technical expert in the field of EE;

         o      One representative of environmental NGOs, who has expertise in the area of

                global climate change.

The four non-government representatives are elected and appointed by the DA.

The members of the MB are appointed for a period of two years. In case of premature

termination of a MB member's rights, a substitute is to be selected and appointed no later than

three months from the date of the event that is considered a reason for the termination. Details

on the termination of the MB members' mandates are specified in Article 8 of the Legal Statute

of BEEF.

5 FINANCIALPRODUCTS


BEEF       provides    three     main      categories    of     financial    products:     PCGs,

co-financing loans and technical assistance. Flexible combinations between the three types of

products are possible. The FM is responsible for the selection of appropriate financing

instruments, based on specific project circumstances, overall project portfolio management

considerations, proper risk allocation among all partners and evolution of the domestic financial

market.

BEEF's program structure is designed with a built-in fungibility of funds between guarantee and

loan facilities in response to changing market conditions.         The split in BEEF's initial

capitalization between the two windows is indicative only, the actual proportion will be largely

market-driven, likely in favor of the guarantees over time. Under one possible scenario, with

prospective further liquidity improvements (especially following EU accession), the loan

window can even be phased out, thus turning BEEF into a full-fledged guarantee facility.

5.1   Partial Credit Guarantees

PCGs are provided in favor of EE project lenders (FIs) whereby BEEF provides assurance of

repayment of the guarantee-covered amount in the case of default by the borrower. BEEF shall

only disburse funds to the lender, if and when a borrower is unable or unwilling to repay the

underlying loan. Fund resources for the PCGs are held in the Guarantee Account of BEEF,

opened in a competitively selected servicing bank.

Standard features of the PCGs provided by BEEF are described as follows:

- Maximum length of tenor up to five years;

- Individual (per project) guarantee commitments shall not exceed the equivalent of US$

    500,000;

- Maximum coverage of 70% on pari passu basis or 30% on a first loss basis. In the case of

    guarantee payout under pari passu, the Fund has the right to recover its loss from the overall

    recovered exposure in proportion to the provided guarantee coverage. In the case of

    guarantee payout under first-loss basis, the Fund has the right to recover its loss from the

    overall recovered exposure after the financing bank has fully recovered its losses;

- Coverage defined in terms of the total outstanding exposure, the principal or the interest due

    by the borrower;




                                                                                              27

BEEF: Operations Manual




- Accelerable or non-accelerable PCGs, depending on the specific characteristics of the EE

    project and the requirements of the co-financing partners. The accelerable PCG is payable up

    to the maximum coverage amount at the time of payment default of the underlying loan in its

    entire amount. The non-accelerable PCG is payable for each repayment installment up to the

    maximum coverage as it falls due under the original repayment schedule;

- Guarantee call conditions are specified in a manner that meets FI requirements and at the

    same time avoids moral hazard risk;

All standard characteristics identified above are indicative. The type of PCG and the advantages

and disadvantages of each option need to be determined by the FM based on (i) the actual

demand and local banking market practices; and (ii) consideration of BEEF's financial

sustainability and risk tolerance capacity.

5.2   Loans

Loans are provided as co-financing on a commercial basis to creditworthy customers for viable

EE projects. Fund resources for the loan facility are held in the Loan Account of BEEF, opened

in a competitively selected servicing bank.

Standard features of the loans provided by BEEF are described as follows:

- Co-financing mode with other commercial financiers (one or more FIs);

- Maximum coverage of 50% on senior loan position or 30% on subordinated loan position;

- Parallel co-financing on a non-commingled basis, with each co-financing party retaining

    control over its own funds and their disbursement;

- Maximum length of tenor up to five years;

BEEF may provide contingent loans, structured as a temporary liquidity back-stop facility. For

example, when a borrower falls into a temporary cash deficiency, the Fund may provide a

contingent loan to make up for the shortfall for the debt service to a commercial bank.

However, this instrument should be used exceptionally in highly justifiable project

circumstances.

All standard characteristics identified above are indicative. The FM can propose co-financing

loans with different structure and characteristics in order to preserve the Fund's flexibility and

meet market demand.




                                                                                                28

BEEF: Operations Manual




The Fund is not expected to provide:

- Credit line facilities to the FIs;

- Project financing on a stand-alone basis;

- Loan financing for operating needs.

5.3   Financial Product Pricing

The pricing of the offered financial products is determined by the FM for each particular project

on the basis of its specific characteristics. The proposed pricing should reflect prevailing market

levels for the respective product and should address the issues of BEEF's competitiveness and

financial sustainability.

For PCGs, BEEF will charge a deal origination fee, payable by the borrower, and a market-

based annual fee on the outstanding guaranteed portion of the loan, payable by the borrower or

the lending FI, depending on the project circumstances. This fee will be risk-based with higher

risk transactions requiring larger fees. As the partial guarantor of a loan, BEEF expects the

lender to charge at or near market rates of interest.

BEEF will charge a stand-by fee for PCGs, when the underlying loan is disbursed gradually.

For direct loans, BEEF shall charge a deal origination fee and a market-based interest rate,

payable by the borrower. The specific risk premium added should reflect the risk inherent in the

direct loan transaction.

BEEF will charge a commitment fee when the loan is disbursed gradually.

The FM is responsible for coming up with the proposed structure and pricing of BEEF's

financial support for EE projects which have passed the initial evaluation stages. These

proposals are submitted for approval to the MB. More details are included in Chapter 7, "The

Project Cycle".




                                                                                                29

6 TECHNICALASSISTANCE


The TA component is used as a non-revolving product to be exhausted by the fifth year of

BEEF's operations. It finances on a grant basis a portion of EE project development, capacity

building, information barrier removal and administrative costs of the Fund.

The TA component covers the following two broad areas:

- Capacity Building and Information Barrier Removal: to fund activities in initial project

    pipeline development (including partial support for energy audits) and project evaluation,

    workshops for potential co-financiers and clients, marketing and dissemination of

    information, training of FM and partners of the Fund (banks, ESCOs, consultants) in EE

    project development and financing techniques.

- Fund Administration: to finance set-up and running costs of the Fund during the first four

    years, including part of the FM remuneration, when the Fund is not yet self-financing.

6.1   Information Barrier Removal Activities

The FM is responsible to ensure sufficient market awareness of the Fund's objectives and

activities among potential Project Developers and co-financing partners. To this end, as part of

the TA component, a coherent communication strategy is developed and implemented. As part

of this strategy, a web site for BEEF's promotion is put in place to provide information enabling

potential clients to quickly determine whether they are eligible for BEEF's financial services.

Through this medium and other means such as workshops, road shows and mass media, the

potential clients and financing partners are informed about the following aspects of BEEF's

activity (i) benefits of EE investments; (ii) eligibility criteria for projects; (iii) loan/guarantee

conditions; and (iv) BEEF procedures for project development support.




                                                                                                  30

BEEF: Operations Manual




6.2   Capacity Building Activities

TA for capacity building may be provided in the following three major areas: (i) support for

project identification, development and financing; (ii) assistance in technical assessment and

verification of results; (iii) and training. Major initiatives include:

- Assistance in the identification, development, assessment and packaging of EE projects to

   make them bankable;

- Co-operation with co-financing partners on the development of innovative financing

   techniques (e.g. project pooling), adequate evaluation and monitoring procedures;

- Organization of workshops oriented to all project participants, aiming to provide training in

   areas such as: introduction of EE technology, economics of the EE projects, benefits to end-

   users coming from EE savings measures, specific features of EE project financing;

- Development of schemes for full or partial grant support to Project Developers and partner

   FIs. The support covers project feasibility studies, energy audits and verification checks.

   Schemes for cost sharing include:

   o Coverage of technical expert service fees. Technical services covered by BEEF include

       verification of actual energy savings during project implementation as well as initial

       reviews and assessment of potential energy savings and GHGs reductions as a result of a

       project;

   o Different mechanisms to share energy audit costs, including:

           Contingent grant of transaction costs. BEEF subsidizes technical costs only in the

           case when the initial technical/energy review results in abandoning a non-viable

           project. When the project turns viable, the audit and verification costs are included in

           the financing package of the borrower.

           Project phasing assistance. It includes the division of a project into several

           independent sub-phases. Thus the initial technical/energy review costs could be

           reduced or deferred to a later stage. Then it can allow the energy savings released in

           the first phase to be used for financing subsequent phases.




                                                                                                31

6.3   TA Approval and Authorization

All TA arrangements are initiated by the Expert Project Coordinator and approved by the ED.

The selection and appointment of external consultants, where this is required for a particular

activity under the TA component, is in accordance with the WB procurement requirements as

described in Chapter 9, "Procurement Procedures". Approval of the related expenditures and

consultants' contracts is in accordance with the procedures and authorization levels specified in

Appendix 15, "Financial Management System Manual".




                                                                                              32

7 THE PROJECT CYCLE


The FM should ensure that BEEF support is provided to financially viable EE projects that

contribute to significant measurable energy savings, resulting in a substantial reduction of

GHGs. All such projects must be in compliance with the eligibility criteria set out in Chapter 4,

"Investment Policy and Eligibility Criteria".

The following are the procedural steps required for implementing the BEEF project cycle. These

have been structured into separate phases, including project identification, project preparation

and development, project appraisal, financial structuring, packaging and approval, financial

closure and disbursement, and project monitoring and evaluation.

The whole project cycle is presented in a checklist, providing an overview of the separate phases

and steps that need to be completed, as well as the execution and approval responsibilities.




                                                                                              33

                                project pipeline list




This phase starts with the identification of an idea for an EE project eligible for BEEF support.

Project ideas can be generated by three major sources:

- Identified by the FM;

- By Project Developers who approach the Fund;

- By potential co-financing partners (commercial banks, ESCOs, leasing companies, etc.).

By means of pro-active identification of eligible projects the FM assumes responsibility for the

generation of the project pipeline. As part of this phase the Expert Project Coordinators perform

the following activities:

- Approach different institutions dealing with EE projects and issues to ensure their effective

    cooperation and information sharing with BEEF (e.g. Energy Efficiency Agency, municipal

    organization);




                                                                                                36

BEEF: Operations Manual




- Approach potential co-financing partners such as major commercial banks and other FIs

    interested in the EE sector to share project ideas;

- Perform sector analysis to determine likely sources of EE project opportunities;

- Identify key players in the respective sectors and prepare a list of potential Project

    Developers;

- Approach the potential Project Developers to present BEEF's activities and discuss

    opportunities for EE projects financing;

- Prepare a list of identified projects for further consideration.

All potential projects identified should comply with BEEF's investment policy, outlined in

Chapter 4, "Investment Policy and Eligibility Criteria".

The outcome of this phase will be a list of pipeline projects for further development and

evaluation. This list is prepared by the Expert Project Coordinators team and is approved by the

ED. The FM processes further only those projects which are financially viable and whose

operational and financial risks can be reasonably measured.

The project pipeline list is updated by the FM with every new project idea that is identified by

the Expert Project Coordinators and approved by the ED.




                                                                                             37

                                 further evaluation or rejection




Upon the approval of the project pipeline, the ED allocates the potential projects to the separate

Expert Project Coordinators for further development. Every Expert Project Coordinator takes

ownership of a number of potential projects, assumes the responsibility for their processing

through all phases of the project cycle and acts as a contact person for the Project Developers

and co-financing partners. Every new project identified is assigned an Expert Project

Coordinator.

The purpose of the initial project screening is to gather information that shall enable the FM to

assess whether the proposed project meets the eligibility criteria of BEEF, whether it fits in the

strategic objectives of the Fund and whether it is worth further involvement by the FM staff.




                                                                                                38

BEEF: Operations Manual




7.2.1 Completion of the Initial Project Proposal ("IPP")

As a first step in this procedure the Project Developer prepares an IPP. It provides a summary of

the project rationale and includes a description of project objectives, implementation details,

timetable, sources and amount of financing required, and potential for energy savings.

The information provided through the IPP includes:

- Details on Project Developer, including contact details, legal status and activity;

- Details on project partners and the rationale for their involvement;

- Basic information about the project, including technical description, location, lifetime,

   duration of implementation;

- Description of project financing, including project costs, required financing, share of equity

   participation, share of other co-financing partners;

- Details on estimated project results and expected benefits, including energy savings

   achieved.

The IPP form is provided to the Project Developers together with comprehensive instructions on

how to fill it out. Upon request by the Project Developer, the Expert Project Coordinator may

assist in the preparation of the IPP.

The completed IPP form should be submitted with all its enclosures. A standard IPP form is

provided in Appendix 1 of the OM.

The Expert Project Coordinator checks whether the IPP is filled out correctly and the

information is in compliance with the instructions provided. If the IPP is not complete, and/or

not correctly filled out, the applicant is notified and invited to revise and complete the

information required.

7.2.2 Completion of the environmental questionnaire (part of the IPP)

As part of the IPP, each Project Developer is required to complete an environmental

questionnaire in order to determine the proposed project category in terms of environmental

impact/risk as per WB requirements and relevant provisions of the Bulgarian legislation. Details

on the environmental questionnaire are provided in Chapter 10, "Environmental Screening and

Assessment".




                                                                                              39

BEEF: Operations Manual




The developer is also required to submit a full environmental package, including evidence of

competent environmental agency decisions and details of any documentation requirements

needed for environmental approval by the competent Bulgarian environmental authority.

Bulgarian Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") requirements are specified in the EPA and

an outline of the environmental consent process is in Appendix 3.


The environmental authorisations for a project must be cleared by the competent Bulgarian

environmental authority. The clearance ensures the compliance of the design and operations

with the Bulgarian environmental laws, standard requirements, and specific norms. The Project

Developer is required to ensure the project (including documentation) is compliant with

Bulgarian environmental laws at all times. In case the Project Developer does not have a valid

authorisation from the Competent Environmental Authority, the Project Developer has to

provide evidence that the company has applied for the required authorisations, and which steps

have been made in the authorisation process.


The Project Developer shall further provide evidence that the applying entity has valid operating

or construction permits and no environmental liabilities in terms of pollution fees and fines.


The Project Developer shall provide a "statement on owned or assumed responsibility" of the

authorised person from the applying entity (the owner, the managing director, or another person

in charge). This person certifies through its signature that all information provided is complete

and accurate.


7.2.3 Environmental categorization

On the basis of the completed environmental questionnaire by the Project Developer and the

collected information, the Expert Project Coordinator assesses the project category both under

Bulgarian EPA and under WB environmental categories and determines required action as

follows:

- Notify project applicant that the project is not eligible for financing under BEEF; or

- Prepare an Environmental Summary Sheet ("ESS"), a standard form of which is provided in

    Appendix 4; or

- Request from the Project Developer a letter from the competent environmental authority that

    an EIA is not required for th project.




                                                                                                 40

BEEF: Operations Manual




Details on the environmental categorization process are provided in Chapter 10, "Environmental

Screening and Assessment".

7.2.4 Completion of the Initial Appraisal Form

The purpose of the Initial Appraisal Form is to assess the project eligibility and reject projects

that are not in compliance with BEEF's objectives and eligibility criteria at an early stage. Its

completion is an internal procedure that all project proposals should pass before a detailed

project appraisal is undertaken.

The Initial Appraisal Form is filled by the Expert Project Coordinator and includes a

recommendation on whether to continue with project development. Together with the project

IPP it is submitted for approval to the ED.

A standard Initial Appraisal Form is enclosed in Appendix 5.

7.2.5 Project screening decision

If the project proposal is rejected, based on the recommendation of the Expert Project

Coordinator and with the consent of the ED, the completed IPP form is returned to the Project

Developer, together with a rejection notification. A copy of the completed IPP form is filed

together with the Initial Appraisal Form by the Expert Project Coordinator.

If the project is approved by the ED for further evaluation, based on the recommendation of the

Expert Project Coordinator, it is registered in BEEF's database and an individual dossier is

established with an identification number (marked on the Initial Appraisal Form). The Project

Developer is notified about the decision and briefed about further steps in the process by the

Expert Project Coordinator.

                                       pre-approval (by MB)




 During this phase, the FM evaluates the viability of the project from financial, technical, EE and

 environmental point of view. The project should be evaluated as feasible in each of the described

 areas of assessment before BEEF can proceed with its support and financing.

 7.3.1 Preparation of the GHG emissions assessment and the Detailed Project Description

            ("DPD")

 The Project Developer is asked to produce a stand-alone assessment of the GHG emissions

 reductions due to the proposed project. This assessment is based on a methodology approved by

 the WB and presented in Appendix 6.

 The DPD form is also completed by the Project Developer. It is designed to serve as an efficient

 information-gathering tool for BEEF and its co-financing partners and, thus, to enable them to



                                                                                                         42

BEEF: Operations Manual




assess the financial, EE technical, and environmental soundness of the project, as well as the

creditworthiness and implementation capacity of the Project Developer.              It includes the

summarized results from the GHG emissions assessment.

As a first step, the Expert Project Coordinator organizes one or several meetings with the Project

Developer to discuss in detail the project specifics and to explain the requirements of BEEF at

the project appraisal stage. The purpose of the meetings is: (i) to instruct the project applicant

on the completion of the GHG emissions reductions assessment and the DPD form; (ii) to

understand the applicant's experience in the preparation of project proposals; and (iii) to

evaluate the need for technical assistance in this phase of the project cycle. The Expert Project

Coordinator should prepare minutes of the meetings and enclose them in the relevant project

dossier.

Technical assistance during this phase can be provided by BEEF in the form of expert

consultations on specific areas of the GHG emissions reduction assessment and the DPD, hiring

technical consultants that will assist the Project Developer in technical calculations and

estimates, assistance in the preparation of a feasibility study and a financial business plan.

The information collected through the DPD includes:

- General information on the Project Developer, including: activity, market position, major

    stakeholders, "Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats" analysis;

- Project description, including technical specifications, implementation partners, description

    of facilities or processes covered, details on past energy supplies;

- Project economics and implementation, including information on project costs by

    components, expected energy savings by source, implementation timetable, summary of cash

    flow projections;

- Details of required financing including structure, collateral provided, details on any

    preliminary agreements signed;

- Project company operation details, including shareholders, management structure,

    investments, historical and projected financial information, major ratios;

- EE and environmental information, including GHG emissions and energy savings due to the

    project.




                                                                                                43

BEEF: Operations Manual




The DPD form is provided to the Project Developers together with comprehensive instructions

on how to complete it. The completed DPD form should be submitted with the stand-alone GHG

emissions reduction assessment report and other relevant enclosures as specified in the standard

DPD form, provided in Appendix 7 to the OM.

The Expert Project Coordinator checks whether the GHG emissions assessment calculations and

the DPD are completed correctly and the information enclosed is in compliance with the

instructions provided. If the documents are incomplete and/or not correctly filled out, the

applicant is notified and invited to revise them.

The completed DPD is then used as a basis for the Expert Project Coordinator to plan and

structure its comprehensive project feasibility analysis. It covers three major aspects of the

project under appraisal: (i) EE technical feasibility; (ii) financial feasibility; and (iii)

environmental feasibility. Each of them is presented as a separate step under this phase,

although their sequence can differ in practice.

7.3.2 EE technical feasibility assessment

The purpose of the technical feasibility assessment is to establish whether the project will

achieve the estimated energy savings and GHG reduction and whether it is designed and

engineered in compliance with generally accepted technical standards and norms.

In the process of the technical assessment the following basic concerns should be addressed:

- Physical scale, design, engineering, location of the facilities;

- Technology to be used, including types of equipment or processes and their suitability for

    project needs;

- Approach for installation and/or construction works  subcontracting vs. internally executed;

- Achievability of the implementation schedules;

- Achievability of stated/committed energy savings and GHG reductions;

- Identification of major risks to achieving projected energy savings and GHG reduction;

- Reliability of stated technical specification of the equipment/installation works;

- Reliability of project implementation company/vendor;

- Reliability of project costs estimates, including engineering, design, installation and

    maintenance costs;




                                                                                             44

BEEF: Operations Manual




- Appropriateness of the allowance for physical and price contingencies.

The Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for the technical feasibility assessment, which is

based on the information supplied in the DPD form and its enclosures. In planning and

completing this step of the project appraisal the Expert Project Coordinator has to assess the

need to request expert advise from another FM expert or to subcontract an external consultant.

Such a decision depends on a number of factors, such as:

- The availability of a technical feasibility study, prepared by a third party and enclosed to the

    DPD, and its quality;

- The level of in-house technical expertise and experience with EE projects of the Project

    Developer;

- The complexity of the proposed EE project from a technological point of view, assessed on

    the basis of the FM team experience;

- Cost-benefit analysis.

As a result of the comprehensive technical assessment of the project, the Expert Project

Coordinator makes a recommendation concerning the technical feasibility of the project and its

eligibility for BEEF support.

7.3.3 Financial feasibility assessment

The purpose of the financial feasibility assessment is to determine if the proposed project is

expected to yield an acceptable financial rate of return and if the Project Developer is able to co-

finance part of the project (at least 10% of the total project costs).

In the process of the financial assessment, the following issues should be addressed:

- Sufficiency of generated cash flows to meet debt servicing requirements;

- Adequate timing of generated cash flows for project economics;

- Positive net present value of the project;

- Reasonable rate of return on investment;

- Achievability of the financial projections;

- Provision of adequate collateral;

- Financial soundness and ability of the Project Developer to finance own equity.




                                                                                                 45

BEEF: Operations Manual




The evaluation of achievability and reliability of financial projections should be determined on

the basis of close examination of historical financial statements and projected performance. The

projected performance and financial results should be presented in a well-developed, detailed

business plan, based on clear assumptions and supported by evidence.

The Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for the financial feasibility assessment. It is based

on information supplied in the DPD form and its enclosures. In planning and completing this

step of project appraisal, the Expert Project Coordinator has to assess the need to request expert

advise from another FM expert.

The results of the financial feasibility assessment may reveal the need for adjustments to project

economics, in which case, the Project Developer has to reconsider the financial part of the

proposal.

As a result of the comprehensive financial assessment of the project, the Expert Project

Coordinator makes a recommendation about the financial feasibility of the project and its

eligibility for BEEF support.

7.3.4 Environmental feasibility assessment

The purpose of the environmental feasibility assessment is to establish whether the proposed

project complies with all regulations and permits provided by the respective regulatory

authorities and with the WB requirements. The Expert Project Coordinator should ensure that all

environmental permits of the project exist and the project is allowable for implementation.

7.3.5 Preparation of the Project Appraisal Report

The results of the comprehensive feasibility assessment of the project are incorporated in the

Project Appraisal Report ("PAR"), a standard form of which is provided in Appendix 8 of the

OM.

The PAR is structured to cover the following major areas of information:

- Summary description of the project, including project economics and estimated energy

    saving and GHG reduction;

- Project risk profile and proposed mitigation steps;

- Project timetable, partners and financing structure;

- Technical feasibility assessment checklist and rationale;

- Financial feasibility assessment checklist and rationale;



                                                                                                46

BEEF: Operations Manual




- Environmental feasibility assessment checklist and rationale;

- Recommendation.

The PAR is filled out by the Expert Project Coordinator and includes a recommendation on

whether BEEF should support the project. Together with the project DPD it is submitted for

review and approval to the ED.

7.3.6 Pre-approval of the project proposal

After the documentation package is reviewed and approved by the ED, it is submitted for pre-

approval by the MB. After reviewing the information package and discussing the project with

the ED and/or other FM experts, the MB approves or rejects the project for BEEF support.

If the project is rejected with recommendations for improvements, the Expert Project

Coordinator should require and assist in the reconsideration or modification of the respective

area by the Project Developer to comply with the recommendations of the MB.




                                                                                           47

                                       initial Term Sheets with
 Process                                        the FI


                                      Obtain signed Acceptance
                                         Letter from project
                                               developer


                                        Negotiate individual
                                     transaction agreements and
                                       project monitoring plan




                                           Submit completed
 Outcome                              documentation package for
                                         review and approval



Following the pre-approval of the project proposal, the Expert Project Coordinator should

commence work on the financing structuring of the project. The purpose of this phase is to

develop and negotiate financing terms for the project together with the partner co-financiers in a

manner that best reflect the specific characteristics of the individual project.

7.4.1 Initial contact with partner FIs

The Expert Project Coordinator approaches a number of potential co-financing partners with a

proposal for financing of a project that is pre-approved for financial support by BEEF. As part

of this step, a draft Term Sheet is provided, including details on the proposed project finance

scheme and the terms of BEEF's participation. It includes sections that have to be filled out by

the FIs with their proposed support for the project and relevant terms. A standard Term Sheet


                                                                                               48

BEEF: Operations Manual




form is provided in Appendix 9 of the OM. The draft Term Sheet is presented to the FIs

together with the comprehensive information package on the project, consisting of the DPD, its

enclosures and the PAR.

All co-financing partners with which BEEF interacts are invited to sign a GFA that governs their

relationships with the Fund as well as the project cycle procedures. Under the GFA, there are two

procedures, depending on the involvement of each of the co-financing parties in the project

appraisal process: a Simplified and a Standard Procedure.

Under the Simplified Procedure, the project is initiated by BEEF and it is in charge of

performing the necessary feasibility analysis and credit assessment. In this case, the FM

performs all initial phases of the project cycle and approaches the FI with a proposal for

financing.

Under the Standard Procedure, the project is initiated by the FI and it performs the feasibility

study and the credit assessment activities in accordance with its internal rules and practices. The

FI may approach BEEF for support  including TA - at any stage of the project appraisal process.

In this case the Expert Project Coordinator decides which procedural steps of the project cycle to

perform so that duplication of procedures is minimized and yet the project cycle is complete.

The procedure for establishing working relationships with commercial banks, including GFA, is

described in detail in Chapter 8, "Relationships with FIs".

7.4.2 Negotiation of financing terms with partner FIs

The interested FIs should submit the completed Term Sheet with proposed modifications within

an agreed timeframe. The Expert Project Coordinator undertakes negotiations on the proposed

terms for financing with the FI that has submitted the most favorable financing terms.

The FI is entitled to perform additional analysis and assessment procedures of the project. The

Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for providing or assisting the FIs in obtaining from the

Project Developer all relevant information that the FIs may need to complete their internal

project evaluation and credit risk assessment.




                                                                                                49

BEEF: Operations Manual




7.4.3 Initialling of the agreed Term Sheet

The Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for designing the optimal financing scheme for

the Project Developer, BEEF and the FI. At the end of the process, all parties should come to an

agreement on the financial product(s) supplied by BEEF, its coverage of the exposure,

anticipated disbursement and maturity date, repayment terms, collateral and interest or fee rates.

When the negotiations are completed, the Term Sheet is initialed by all project financiers. It

represents the agreed terms of the co-financing partner's participation in the project scheme.

The ED reviews and initials the Term Sheet on behalf of BEEF.

7.4.4 Acceptance Letter by the project developer

The Term Sheet is additionally agreed with the Project Developer. This is acknowledged by the

signing of an Acceptance Letter by the Project Developer. The standard Acceptance Letter is

provided in Appendix 10 of the OM.

7.4.5 Negotiation of individual transaction agreement

After the financing terms and structure of the project are agreed between BEEF, the FI and the

Project Developer, the specific provisions of the particular PCG facility or co-financing support

are additionally defined in the individual transaction agreement. It shall be based on the initialed

Term Sheet and differ for each particular transaction. The individual transaction agreement shall

include, as an attachment, a project monitoring plan, which is detailed later in the section.

The Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for negotiating the individual transaction

agreement. The detailed provisions governing the relationships between BEEF and the partner

FI will be provided in the GFA (a standard GFA is enclosed in Appendix 11 of the OM).

7.4.6 Drafting of project monitoring plan

The project monitoring plan ensures effective implementation of sound financial and energy

savings follow-up procedures by the project financiers.        It is included in the individual

transaction agreement thus ensuring clear understanding of the contractual obligations of all

parties involved in terms of timing and contents of reported project information.




                                                                                                 50

BEEF: Operations Manual




The Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for drafting the project monitoring plan. The

purpose of the project monitoring plan is three-fold:

    - To ensure timely and adequate reporting. The reporting requirements may vary by type

       and frequency of project reports depending on the type of transaction and the specific

       nature of the credit facility. However, reporting shall be scheduled to occur on a

       quarterly basis;

    - To ensure the establishment of a sound "early warning system" by the FM. This will

       track information that is relevant to the financial success of the project. The factors to be

       monitored will vary according to the nature of the financial arrangements and the form

       of risk sharing. This will enable the FM to identify any potential difficulties in the

       project and take appropriate action.

    - To ensure that the project develops in accordance with BEEF's strategic objectives. This

       includes periodical reporting of actual energy savings and GHG emission reductions

       achieved by the Project Developer as well as annual verification of the project results by

       an independent party.

7.4.7 Review and approval of the documentation package

The documentation package for the financial structuring of the project is submitted for review

and approval by the ED.




                                                                                                 51

7.5.1 MB approval

The ED submits to the MB for approval the complete documentation package related to the

project financial structuring.    This package includes the initialed Term Sheet, the signed

Acceptance Letter, the draft individual transaction agreement with the project monitoring plan,

as well as any additional relevant correspondence or information obtained since the project pre-

approval.

The MB is responsible for reviewing the submitted documentation.                    On the basis of that

documentation the MB can:

- Approve the project and recommend disbursement;

- Reject the project if it is in breach of the investment policy and eligibility criteria. The

   project can be resubmitted for approval after the required modifications of the financing

   parameters are agreed with the FI and the Project Developer.




                                                                                                     52

7.5.2 WB approval

In the first year of BEEF's operations, the WB shall review all proposals for co-financing and

PCGs and the Fund shall not enter into any financing agreements without obtaining "no

objection" from the WB.

7.6   Phase 6: Financial Closure and Disbursement

7.6.1 Financial closure

Following the MB (and WB, when applicable) approval of the project, the individual transaction

agreement is subject to signing. The ED is authorized to sign the individual transaction

agreement on behalf of BEEF.

7.6.2 Disbursement of funds

The disbursement of funds to the Project Developer is carried out in accordance with the

procedures specified in the Project Financial Management System Manual.




                                                                                           53

Implementation of the project is the sole responsibility of the Project Developer. The FM,

through the Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for monitoring the performance of each

project, and for periodically collecting the relevant reported data in accordance with the project

monitoring plan. The purpose of the financial monitoring is to ensure that the financing received

is utilized in compliance with the financing conditions and to serve as an early warning system

for potential financial distress.

The Project Developer should procure goods and works in compliance with WB procurement

rules as described in Chapter 9, "Procurement Procedures. It is the FM's responsibility (through

the assigned Expert Project Coordinators) to assist and supervise the project beneficiaries in the

application of the appropriate procurement methods.

The FM will also periodically collect data about the EE realization of the projects, including

calculations of the energy savings and GHG emissions reductions actually achieved. This

information will serve to evaluate the project's compliance with BEEF's objectives and

eligibility criteria and to provide the necessary data for the periodical reporting by BEEF to the

WB on project implementation progress.




                                                                                                    54

BEEF: Operations Manual




As part of the project monitoring process the Expert Project Coordinator will perform the

following tasks:

    - Monitoring of repayment performance of principal and interest against terms set out in

        the facility agreements;

    - Site inspections to continually assess project management;

    - Collating and analyzing financial information submitted by the Project Developer;

    - Maintain a credit file, including all original project cycle documentation, financial

        statements and spreadsheets, site visit reports, correspondence/memoranda.

7.7.1 Standardised reporting of information from counterparties

The information that needs to be provided periodically from the Project Developers will be

agreed as a part of the pre-agreed project monitoring plan. It will be collected through a stand-

alone report summarising the GHG emissions and energy savings that have occurred to date and

a Project Realization Report, both of which will be completed periodically by the Project

Developer and submitted to BEEF. The stand-alone summary report will include calculations

in accordance with the methodology presented in Appendix 6. A standard Project Realization

Report form is enclosed as Appendix 12 to the OM. It can be modified by the Expert Project

Coordinator to reflect specific features of individual projects. The co-financing FI can also

receive copies of the Project Realization Report upon request.

The Project Realization Report should also include information on procurement procedures and

goods and works actually procured and installed.

The Expert Project Coordinator is responsible for monitoring the repayment of the loans in

accordance with the pre-agreed repayment schedule. For loans provided by BEEF as co-

financing, this information will be directly available from the financial management system of

BEEF. For PCGs, the information on the servicing of the debt will be provided by the partner FI

in the form of Performance Status Reports. A standard Performance Status Report is enclosed in

Appendix 13 of the OM.




                                                                                              55

BEEF: Operations Manual




7.7.2 Project monitoring report

Based on the collected data, the Expert Project Coordinator prepares a project monitoring report

for all projects under his/her supervision. The report will include details on the performance of

individual projects from a financial and EE point of view and explanation of variances to plan, if

any. The report will also include data and calculations on the individual project performance

indicators. The report will be submitted for review to the ED.

7.7.3 Frequency of reporting

The FM shall collect information from Project Developers and partner FIs for the purpose of

monitoring on at least a quarterly basis. Project monitoring reports will also be prepared on a

quarterly basis. It is possible that information from a particular source is collected more often

due to the specifics of the project, subject to the discretion of the Expert Project Coordinator.

7.7.4 Verification of reported information

Monitoring and evaluation of project results in terms of achieved energy savings or GHG

emissions reduction will be performed by the MB on the basis of verification procedures carried

out by independent experts. Such verification procedures will be performed for each individual

project on an annual basis. The independent experts will be appointed in accordance with the

WB procurement procedures described in Chapter 9, "Procurement Procedures". The FM team

will be responsible for coordinating the appointment and reporting of the verification results,

including their presentation to the MB and WB.

The Project Developer should be required to maintain and provide documentary records of

energy consumption and other project implementation details to allow verification of the

reported information.

7.8   Phase 8: Credit Recovery Procedures

Credit recovery procedures will be initiated whenever the Expert Project Coordinator identifies a

problem with any of the monitored exposures, whether a loan or a PCG. Such a problem may

be: (i) an exposure operating in breach of the agreed terms; or (ii) an exposure showing early

warning signs of difficulties in its financial performance or its ability to realize the planned

energy savings. The Expert Project Coordinator will be responsible for providing effective

problem credit administration by early detection of potential problems and immediate corrective

action.




                                                                                                 56

BEEF: Operations Manual




7.8.1 Early warning signs detection

Warning signs can be divided between those, which are apparent from general observation of the

Project Developer's operations and those apparent from financial and other documentary and

explanatory information provided by the Project Developer. Some of the information and

variances from planned parameters will be presented as part of the Project Realization Reports

submitted by the Project Developers. The Expert Project Coordinator will perform additional

analysis of the supplied information and calculation of project financial ratios and parameters as

part of the regular project monitoring reports. Any significant deviation from the planned values

of financial indicators will serve as warning that credit recovery should be implemented.

Early warning signs should be communicated to the co-financing partner FI on a timely basis, so

that appropriate action is taken by all co-financiers.

7.8.2 Establishing a recovery plan

The need to establish a recovery plan and to implement it will be decided separately for each

project and its unique circumstances. This will be based on a detailed investigation performed

by the Expert Project Coordinator to determine the seriousness of the encountered problems and

to determine the particular form of default, which may be triggered by temporary or more

serious permanent difficulties in project implementation. Alternative recovery strategies will

include continuance of credit, debt restructuring, interest deferral, repayment demand and

collateral realization.

7.8.3 Approval and execution of recovery plan

The recovery plan will be approved by the ED and the MB. The Expert Project Coordinator will

be responsible for the implementation of the approved recovery plan.

All credit recovery procedures will be performed in strict compliance with the relevant

legislation of Bulgaria. The Expert Project Coordinator will be entitled to use external legal

advisors as appropriate. The legal advisors will be selected and hired in accordance with the

procedures described in Chapter 9, "Procurement Procedures".

7.8.4 Division of responsibilities on collateral realisation

The division of credit recovery procedures and collateral realization responsibilities between

BEEF and the partner FI will be specified in the GFA (Appendix 11). The details regarding the

claims and allocation of the realized collateral proceeds will be specified in the individual

transaction agreement.




                                                                                               57

8 RELATIONSHIPS WITH CO-FINANCING PARTNERS


The FM is responsible for establishing good working relationships with its potential

co-financing partners.

The FM should carefully consider the financial standing/performance of its co-financing

partners. This is a necessary procedure ensuring the prudent management of BEEF's PCG and

loan facilities.

8.1   Assessment and Selection of Partner FIs

The general procedure to be applied by the FM in assessing its potential financial partners

involve some preliminary investigation, focusing on the following requirements:

- Good market reputation;

- Adequate credit rating;

- Good financial health and operational performance;

- Adequate loan origination and administration procedures;

- Sound credit risk assessment practices;

- Low level of historical default rates;

- Relevant client base.

A substantial part of this data is available or can be judged on the basis of research of publicly

available information. The rest of the information may be collected during meetings and

discussions with FI management and on the basis of specifically requested and provided

information such as internal control or credit assessment procedures and auditor's reports.

8.2   Signing of GFA

The ED is expected to conclude GFAs with the selected FIs. The GFA is designed as a standard

Memorandum of Understanding between BEEF and the FI rather than as a binding contract. It

provides overall guidance on the parameters of the relationship between the two parties. Specific

provisions for each transaction are additionally defined in the individual transaction agreements.

The signed GFA promotes the establishment of mutual cooperation with BEEF on the financing

of projects. The GFA provides general guidelines on project eligibility criteria, major features of




                                                                                                 58

the financial products offered by BEEF, standardised procedures for application processing,

approval, project monitoring and reporting.

A standard GFA is provided in Appendix 11 of the OM. Some of its provision may be subject to

modification on the basis of additionally negotiated terms with individual partner FIs.

The GFA acknowledges that there are two mechanisms for project origination and development:

(i) BEEF evaluates the project and submits a completed project proposal for financing to the FI;

and (ii) the FI develops the project and submits a completed project proposal for co-financing to

BEEF. In order to prevent duplication of feasibility and credit risk assessment procedures

between the co-financing partners, two separate procedures are distinguished in the GFA under

each scenario: (i) the Simplified Procedure; and (ii) the Standard Procedure.

8.3   Simplified Procedure

Under the Simplified Procedure, BEEF identifies and develops the project and then submits the

completed and pre-approved documentation package with a proposal for financing to the FI. In

this case, all preliminary evaluation and assessment procedures are performed by the FM, as

detailed in Chapter 7, "The Project Cycle". The FI can choose between evaluating the project on

the basis of the information provided by BEEF and carrying out additional limited feasibility

assessment procedures.

8.4   Standard Procedure

Under the Standard Procedure, the financing proposal is initiated and developed by the FI,

including the performance of all initial credit risk and project feasibility assessment. The FI then

approaches BEEF with a proposal for co-financing or PCG support. The proposal should

enclose the completed project documentation package, including the results from technical and

financial feasibility assessment performed by the FI or external experts. In this case the FM may

partially rely on the evaluation procedures performed by the FI and may carry out limited

additional checks and assessment.

8.5   Technical Assistance

All partner FIs are eligible for TA throughout the project assessment process, whether applying

the Standard or Simplified procedures. The TA provided to partner FIs is limited to technical

feasibility studies and technical project assessment and is specified in the GFA (Appendix 11).




                                                                                                 59

9 PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES


The procurement of services, works and goods under the GEF-financed components is

performed in accordance with WB procurement guidelines. Project components not financed by

GEF are procured in accordance with relevant procurement regulations of the other donors, as

specified in the respective donors' agreements. When no procurement requirements are imposed

on behalf of the other donors, the WB procurement procedures apply.

Under the WB procurement rules, the Fund uses the following types of procurement methods,

depending on the size and the type of the transaction/contract:

9.1   Contracts under Sub-loans

Procurement of goods and works (and/or supply and install packages as appropriate) under the

sub-loans (funded by GEF component) is conducted by the Project Developers (sub-project

sponsors) in compliance with WB procurement rules. It is the FM's responsibility (through the

assigned Expert Project Coordinators) to assist and supervise the project beneficiaries in the

application of the appropriate procurement methods.

The applicable methods of procurement depend on the size of the contract. The following rules

and procedures (in compliance with WB Guideline: "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA

Credits") apply:

  - International Competitive Bidding ("ICB") procurement method for contracts with

      estimated value exceeding US$ 3 mln.;

  - National Competitive Bidding ("NCB") procurement method for contracts with estimated

      value between US$ 3 mln. and US$ 1 mln.;

  - Prudent Commercial Practice ("PCP") procurement method for contracts with estimated

      value below US$ 1 mln. This is subject to a transparent process and evaluation based on

      pre-disclosed criteria for contract award.

In the case of PCP, the selected contractors and suppliers should have adequate financial and

technical resources to perform the contract satisfactorily. It is the FM's responsibility (through

the Expert Project Coordinator) to ensure that procurement for contracts co-financed by BEEF is

performed on the basis of at least three quotations.

The first five contracts regardless of size and all subsequent contracts above US$ 0.5 mln. are

subject to WB's prior review. Other contracts will be subject to ex-post review.




                                                                                                60

BEEF: Operations Manual




For reference to any details on the separate stages and procedures of the procurement methods,

refer to the WB Guideline: "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", May 2004.

9.2    Contracts under PCGs

The WB procurement rules do not apply to contracts for projects in which BEEF is involved

only with a PCGs. In such cases, procurement is conducted in accordance with PCP or the

procedures of the financing bank (as appropriate) regardless of contract size.

It is the FM's responsibility (through the Expert Project Coordinator) to ensure that procurement

is conducted using PCP on the basis of at least three quotations.

GEF loan and PCG components are disclosed in the Procurement Plan presented in

Appendix 14.

9.3    Consultant services

For procurement of Consultant services funded out of the proceeds of the GEF grant, BEEF

applies the following rules (in compliance with WB Guideline: "Selection and Employment of

Consultants "):

   - Quality and Cost based Selection ("QCBS") method in the selection of a FM (the main

        procurement action to be conducted by MEER);

   - Least Cost Selection ("LCS") method in the selection of a Financial Auditor;

   - Individual Consultants ("IC") method for procurement of various advisory and consulting

        services;

   - Consultants' Qualification ("CQ") method for procurement of marketing and other

        subproject development and project management services;

Major elements of the Consultant services, their estimated costs and procurement methods are

summarised in a table format as part of the overall Procurement Plan, presented in Appendix 14.

The WB reviews, regardless of value, Terms of Reference of all Consultant services financed by

GEF. All consultants' contracts above US$ 0.1 mln. are subject to WB's prior review.

Consultant services cannot be financed from the portion of the GEF grant allocated to

sub-loans and PCGs.

For reference to any details on the separate stages and procedures of the consultants'

procurement process refer to the WB Guideline: "Selection and Employment of Consultants",

May 2004.

BEEF: Operations Manual




9.4   Incremental operating costs

In the initial years, operating expenses of BEEF are financed under the incremental operating

cost category of the GEF grant with procurement based on the annually approved budget and

using competitive selection (wherever possible). Procurement methods to be applied may

include Shopping or PCP on the basis of at least three quotations/offers. Expenditures under the

incremental operating costs category are reviewed annually.

The estimated GEF funded part under this category is presented in the Procurement Plan,

presented in Appendix 14.

9.5   Procurement Plan

The MB approves BEEF's Procurement Plan as part of the OM approval procedure. The

Procurement Plan is subject to annual reviews by the WB and the MB and may be updated, as

appropriate, upon consultations with the WB.

In addition to procurement methods described in this chapter, different methods may be deemed

applicable in the future, which are enforced subject to WB and MB approval.

The Procurement Plan, including project elements, estimated costs and procurement methods, is

enclosed in Table 1 in Appendix 14. Details on the separate phases of the procurement process

and the timetable are provided in Table 2 in Appendix 14.

All procurement contracts for goods and works above US$ 10,000 are subject to MB's approval.

For smaller value contracts, the ED or the Financial Controller may give authorization (in

compliance with Project FMS Manual). All consultant contracts (regardless of value) financed

by GEF TA component are subject to MB authorization.




                                                                                              62

10 ENVIRONMENTALSCREENINGANDASSESSMENT


10.1 Project Classification

The overall Bulgaria Energy Efficiency Fund has been given World Bank Environmental

Category FI, which stands for Financial Intermediary. In an FI project, specific projects are

identified during implementation, and the responsibility for environmental due diligence with

respect to supported projects lies with the financial intermediary  in this case, BEEF.

10.2 General Approach

All projects financed by BEEF will be carried out in an environmentally and socially responsible

manner, in accordance with the legal and regulatory framework in force in Bulgaria and the

provisions of the OM. Bulgaria's environmental assessment legislation is essentially aligned

with the comparable EU directives. There is also comparability with the World Bank

Operational Policy on environmental assessment, OP/BP/GP 4.01, which is presented in

Appendix 15 of the OM. All the key elements of a well-developed environmental impact

assessment system  such as notification of the competent environmental authority, screening of

the project to determine the needed level of environmental scrutiny, analysis of alternatives,

licensing/permitting and public disclosure  are all present in the Bulgarian EPA and its

associated regulations/ordinances. Therefore, compliance with Bulgarian environmental

assessment policies and procedures will be, in most cases, a necessary and sufficient condition

for financing of projects from BEEF.

Furthermore, projects to be financed by BEEF are expected to be environmentally beneficial,

reducing energy consumption and thereby emissions, not only of GHG but also of local air

pollutants. None of the projects to be financed by BEEF are expected to have any adverse large

scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Emissions will be within limits set by Bulgarian

law.

10.3 Ineligible Projects

BEEF will not finance projects, which fall within the scope of Annex 1 of the Bulgarian EPA

(presented in Appendix 2 of the OM). In terms of the nature and magnitude of their

environmental impacts, such projects are comparable to projects falling within the WB's

Category A (World Bank Policy OP4.01, refer to Appendix 15 of the OM). Such projects

require detailed environmental studies and elaborate mitigation measures, which would not be

consistent with BEEF's orientation towards projects that are relatively easy to appraise and

implement.




                                                                                             63

BEEF: Operations Manual




10.4 Institutional Arrangements and Process

The FM of BEEF has one EE technical expert with environmental background who provides

expertise assistance to all Expert Project Coordinators on the EIA and environmental

management aspects of the projects proposed for financing from BEEF. If necessary, the FM

may decide to hire external environmental consultants to assist the Expert Project Coordinators

on a project-by-project basis (the consultants will be selected and appointed in accordance with

the requirements of Chapter 9, "Procurement Procedures").

The FM will require that every project proposal include the following questionnaire completed

by the developer/investor:

    1. Has the competent environmental authority (MEW or the Regional Inspectorate of

       Environment and Water) been notified about the intent of the developer/investor to

       undertake the project?

    2. Has the competent environmental authority responded (in writing)?

    3. Based on the response from the competent environmental authority, which of the

       following applies:

                   a. The project falls within the scope of Annex 1 of the Bulgarian EPA;

                   b. The project falls within the scope of Annex 2 of the EPA;

                   c. The project is likely to have an impact on protected areas of the National

                       Environmental Network ("NEN");

                   d. The project is likely to have transboundary impacts;

                   e. None of the above (please explain).

    4. If the project falls within the scope of Annex 2 of the EPA, has the developer/investor

       submitted to the competent environmental authority the information necessary to make

       the decision whether Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") under Article 93 of the

       EPA is required?

    5. Has the competent environmental authority notified the developer/investor about its

       decision on the need for EIA? If so, which decision (EIA required or not required) was

       made?




                                                                                             64

BEEF: Operations Manual




Based on the answers obtained through this questionnaire, the FM applies the following

screening table to determine further actions.

As the table describes, the actions of the FM will be based on a screening process that has its

basis in the Bulgarian EPA. The matching of the Bulgarian and WB Categories A, B, and C is

approximate and mostly for reference of the WB staff supervising BEEF.




1Refer to Appendix 15.
2A standard Environmental Summary Sheet is given in Appendix 4 of the OM.
3Note that the in certain cases the Bank may require that an Environmental Management Plan ("EMP") is prepared
as required for Bank's Category B projects. In such a case, the EMP should be prepared by the FM's environmental
staff in collaboration with the developer/investor (OP4.01Annex C Guidelines can be found in Appendix 14).


                                                                                                            65

BEEF: Operations Manual




The FM must ensure that the actions detailed in the above table are applied including the

implementation and completion of World Bank Safeguard Policies if necessary. In addition, for

projects coming under Annex 2 of the Bulgarian EPA requiring the completion of an EIA, the

Project Developer must consult groups affected by the project, and if appropriate, take their

views into account in both environmental documentation and design of the project. A written

description of the consultation and resultant actions must be presented as part of the

environmental information and summarized by the FM in the ESS (Appendix 4).


10.5 Exceptional/Disputed Cases

There are two principal situations where exceptions may have to be made from the procedure

described above.

First, in cases where the WB's environmental staff disagrees with the decision of the Bulgarian

environmental authorities to exclude the project from the EIA, the FM will be asked to

communicate this point of disagreement to the Bulgarian competent environmental authority.

Then, if the decision to exclude the project from EIA is not changed, the WB may require that

the procedure of the WB's Environmental Assessment Category B apply. In such a case, an

Environmental Management Plan ("EMP") will be prepared as required for WB's Category B

projects (see Annex C of the WB's OP 4.01 in Appendix 15). The FM will prepare the EMP, in

collaboration with the developer/investor.

It is possible that some projects may influence natural habitats, cultural property, or other

aspects better covered by the WB safeguards than by the Bulgarian law. In such cases where the

WB policies offer greater protection to such resources than Bulgarian law, the WB may require

mitigation measures commensurate with the WB's procedures. The FM's environmental staff

will work with the developer/investor in completing the requirements of these safeguard

policies.




                                                                                            66

11.2 Five-year Business Strategy

The Five-year Business Strategy of BEEF is prepared by the FM upon the start of BEEF's

operations. It elaborates the strategic approach proposed by the FM in running and developing

the Fund's operations in a way that best corresponds to its objectives.

The Business Strategy includes a long-term budget, covering the first five years of BEEF's

operations, prepared in compliance with the financial performance indicators to ensure self-

financing of the Fund by year 5 of its operation. The Business Strategy is updated once every

three years and submitted for approval to the MB.


11.3 Business Plan

The Business Plan is prepared by the FM annually (by 31 October) and covers the Fund's

operations for the next year. It describes the level of activity and financial results to which the

FM commits, as well as the planned approach and activities to achieve them. The Business Plan

and its targets provide the basis for the performance-based payments to the FM. Specifically the

Business Plan should focus on the following areas:

    - Description of the sectors where BEEF will concentrate its activity;

    - Analysis of the stakeholders involved, including Project Developers and co-financing

         partners;

    - The number of new projects planned;

    - Amount of disbursements planned, split by PCGs and loans;

    - Details on planned technical assistance initiatives;

    - Analysis of BEEF's product pricing;

    - Financial performance of BEEF.

The Business Plan is submitted for review to the WB, and after incorporation of all agreed

comments, is submitted for approval to the MB. The Business Plan for a particular year is

adopted by 31 December of the preceding year.


11.4 Annual Report

The Annual Report is prepared by the FM. It is based on the actual financial and operational

results achieved by BEEF during the year. It includes evaluation of financial performance

against the Business Plan and Operational Budget.

The Annual Report is submitted to the MB for approval together with the Audited Financial



                                                                                                  68

Statements and the Auditor's Report. After approval by the MB, the documentation package is

submitted to the WB within six months after the end of each financial year.


11.5 Operational Budget

The Operational Budget is prepared by the FM annually. It includes the budgeted levels of

revenues and costs for the next year that form the basis of the financing requirements by the

Fund from technical assistance. In particular, the Operational Budget shall focus on each of the

following areas:

     - Budgeted levels of revenues split between interest from loans, fees from PCGs, interest

         on bank accounts, other income;

12 FINANCIALMANAGEMENT SYSTEM


BEEF implements a Project FMS in compliance with the requirements of the WB, the GoB and

the other donors. The Project FMS provides guidelines on standardised disbursement practices,

accounting policies, internal control procedures, reporting, auditing and budgeting requirements,

that ensure the BEEF Project is managed in compliance with stated objectives of the donors.

The Project accounting system is based on accounting software "Business Management System"

developed by Tonegan. The software was initially designed to meet the specific needs and

reporting requirements of the MEER. For the purpose of WB reporting and to meet the specific

Project accounting needs of the Fund, the software was upgraded with additional modules. The

new elements of the system allow for preparation of FMRs and Disbursement reports on SA and

Project GA, which comply with the requirements of the WB.

The elements of the Project FMS include: authorization and internal control procedures,

disbursement procedures and guidelines on management of funds, reporting and auditing

requirements and Project bank accounts management.

Details on the Project FMS are provided in the Project Financial Management System Manual.
