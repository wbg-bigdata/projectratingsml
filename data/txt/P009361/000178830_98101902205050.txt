INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
CEREAL SEEDS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the equivalent
of US$7.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a cereal seeds
project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
(R72-230) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 13, 1972.
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I. Annex I also contains a brief
description of the economy as presented in paragraphs 3-22 of my Report and
Recommendation to the Executive Directors on an Education Project (IDA/R 73-60)
dated May 29, 1973, with minor modifications.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        Paragraphs 3-9 of the President's Report of the same date on a
proposed technical assistance credit to Bangladesh (Report No. P-1281BD)
contain a description of Bank Group Operations in Bangladesh. Annex II
contains a summary statement of (i) IDA credits made to Bangladesh since
1972, (ii) the loan and credits to Pakistan for projects located wholly in
Bangladesh which have not been reactivated, and (iii) notes on the status
of execution of ongoing projects.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN BANGLADESH
4.        Agriculture is clearly Bangladesh's most important economic sector,
on whose development growth as well as welfare depend. Agriculture produces
more than 55 percent of the nation's GDP and 80 percent of its jobs. Rice
cultivation, which covers about 75-80 percent of the cultivated area, provides
about 85 percent of the country's foodgrain requirements. Wheat acreage,
still very small, has been growing rapidly in certain areas and wheat is
likely to become a more significant part of foodgrain supply. Jute cultiva-
tion earns over 85 percent of Bangladesh's foreign exchange either directly,
through the export of raw jute, or indirectly through the export of Jute
goods. At the same time Jute is the mjor input for Bangladesh's most
important industry.



-2-
5.        The most pressing problem currently facing the Government is the
provision of adequate supplies of food. Although the land is fertile and
the farmers industrious, an excessively high population density combined
with traditional farming techniques and a precarious environment produce
perennial food shortages and the necessity of using scarce foreign exchange
resources to meet the deficit.
6.        Bangladesh lies on a deltaic plain of 33 million acres, of which
approximately 22.5 million acres are cultivated. Most of the soils are
fertile. It has a tropical monsoon climate with high rainfall (over 50
inches a year) and humidity. About 80 percent of the rainfall is concen-
trated in the monsoon months of June to October, with the remainder occuring
primarily during the period March to May as Northwesterly thunderstorms.
In areas with adequate moisture, many farmers plant two or more crops,
resulting in a relatively high cropping intensity (146 percent in 1969/70).
There are, however, many problems inherent in the agricultural sector: few
opportunities exist for expanding the area under crops; as much as one-third
of the country is threatened by severe annual floods; during the dry season
some 80 percent of the land remains fallow due to lack of water; severe
cyclones periodically afflict farms near the coast.
7.        Increased population pressure on the land has led to very small
and fragmented farms. At the time of the 1960 Agricultural Census, when
the average size of a farm was estimated to be 3.5 acres, nearly 80 percent
of the farms covered 5 acres or less and more than half were less than 2.5
acres. Since then the average farm size has become closer to 2.5-3.0 acres.
As a result of the small farm size and lack of modern inputs, farmer incomes
are low. The incomes of landless workers, who comprise about 20 percent of
the rural population, are still lower.
8.        Faced with these very difficult problems, the Government appears
to be evolving a development strategy which concentrates on increasing
agricultural (and particularly foodgrain) production through: (a) the rapid
spread of new high-yielding varieties (HYV) of rice and wheat; (b) provision
of modern inputs, particularly chemical fertilizers; and (c) where possible,
the expansion of irrigation primarily through tubewells and low-lift pumps.
Since no significant additional amount of land can be brought into cultiva-
tion, the strategy is based on more intensive use of land by spreading
easily divisible inputs which promise rapid yield increases. It takes
advantage of the high-yielding rice varieties evolved at the International
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and first introduced into Bangladesh before
independence. Not only does the strategy provide the possibility for
dramatic increases in output, but also the nature of the inputs is such that
even the smallest farmer can usually afford some of them -- even if only
enough to cover a small part of his farm. Since the strategy emphasizes
a labor-intensive technology, it is likely that employment opportunities
will increase. Thus, the benefits of the strategy are likely to be spread
widely across income groups. The less divisible inputs -- tubewells and
low-lift pumps - are generally provided to pump groups consisting of perhaps
20-56 farmers, so the benefits of these indivisible inputs are shared as
well. Experience to date with IR-20, an improved rice variety for the



- 3 -
most important summer crop, suggests the potentially rapid spread of the
strategy. Between 1970 and 1972, area under this new variety grew from less
than 200,000 acres to over 1.6 million acres, or about 18 percent of the
total acreage under that crop.
9.        One crucial problem of the new strategy is that the current system
of seed production and distribution is inadequate. Steps need to be taken
to insure the continuous development of new higher-yielding seed varieties
better suited to the ecological conditions of Bangladesh and to get sufficient
quantities of these new seeds into the hands of the farmers. The proposed
project would assist the Government in meeting these needs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
10.       The proposed cereal seeds project would be the initial phase in
establishing a modern seeds industry in Bangladesh. Its objective would
be to produce 12,000 tons of certified seed per annum (10,000 tons paddy
seed and 2,000 tons wheat seed); to build up the necessary institutions to
allow future expansion of seed production; and to provide for further devel-
opment of the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). When fully
operational, the project would correct deficiencies in the existing seeds
program, treble the size of the program and fill gaps in the rice research
program. It would complement the Government's overall agricultural strategy
by providing the physical and institutional means for ensuring timely,
high-quality supplies of the most crucial input for that strategy -- seeds
of high-yielding varieties. The introduction of high-yielding seed by the
project would complement other IDA credits to Bangladesh for the agricultural
sector -- particularly the Chandpur II Irrigation Project, the Northwest
Region Tubewells Project and the Irrigation Engineering Project (Credits
Nos. 340-BD, 341-BD and S-14 BD respectively)--and would also assist antici-
pated future agricultural projects. A Development Credit and Project Summary
is attached as Annex III. Map I shows the location of major project activities.
11.       An IDA credit for the project was requested by the Government of
Pakistan in 1970. The project was prepared in late 1970 by a Government
team assisted by an FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission. The IDA mission
to appraise the project was in the field in March 1971 when political unrest
interrupted their work. The project had to be reformulated in light of
subsequent changes and was reappraised by an IDA mission in November 1972.
The appraisal report is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations took place between May 24 and June 1, 1973 with
Messrs. M. Murshed, Chairman of the Bangladesh Agricultural Development
Corporation, Q.S. Alam, Deputy Secretary, Planning Commission, and A.R.
Choudhury, First Secretary, Finance, Bangladesh Embassy, representing the
Government.

Project Description
12.       The major components of the proposed project include:    (a) develop-
ment of two farms of the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation
(BADC) for foundation seed production and 15 BADC farms for certified seed
production; (b) development of a contract growers' scheme in five areas;
(c) construction of six seed processing plants; (d) provision of seed storage
and marketing services; (e) institution of a seed quality control service;
(f) development of BRRI; and (g) provision of training programs and technical
assistance. New varieties of seed (breeder seed), which would be produced
at BRRI's main station or any of its four substations, would undergo the first
stage of multiplication at two BADC farms. The seed from these two farms
(foundation seed) would then be multiplied once again on the 15 other BADC
farms included in the project and on the private contract growers' farms.
Seed from these farms would be delivered to the six processing centers built
under the project where they would be cleaned, dried, dressed, packaged and
stored. Before the distribution and sale of this seed, the Seeds Certifica-
tion Agency (SCA) to be developed under the project would carry out laboratory
and field tests to ensure that only seed of standards of purity, health and
germinating capacity prescribed by the Government would be certified for
sale (certified seed).
13.       The Ministry of Agriculture would have overall responsibility for
the project. Seed production, processing and sales would be carried out under
the direction of the General Manager (Field) of BADC. The Government has
recently filled this post which was vacant at the time of appraisal.    hle
Government has agreed to establish a National Seeds Board, in the Ministry
of Agriculture, which would be responsible for coordinating the implementation
of the project and making recommendations concerning the release of new seed
varieties, seed importation and multiplication targets, quality standards and
prices. The establishment of the National Seeds Board is a condition of
effectiveness of the credit.
14.       The total project cost is US$10.6 million, including contingencies,
with IDA finaancing US$7.5 million (or about 71 percent). Tne credit would
finance all of the foreign excnange costs of the project (US$6.0 million)
and the equivalent of US$1.5 million of the local currency expenditures.
Annex III summarizes the project cost by major component, the financing plan
and the disbursement schedule.
15.       The high priority given to establishing a seeds project in
Bangladesh at this time stems from the need to ensure rapid multiplication
and distribution of promising new varieties. A vigorous rice research
program to produce such new varieties is crucial to the Government's overall
strategy for the agricultural sector. BRRI is responsible for rice research
in Bangladesh. Since its formation as a semi-autonomous institute in the mid-
sixties, it has developed, with substantial assistance from the International
Rice Research Institute and the Ford Foundation, a pipeline of new varieties
of paddy seed, some of which have been released for use by farmers. The



- 5 -
project would assist BRRI to (a) develop its four regional substations to
enable it to produce varieties suitable to the varied ecological conditions
of Bangladesh and (b) construct staff housing at its headquarters, so staff
would not have to commute several hours each day from Dacca to the research
station at Joydebpur. The development of BRRI planned under the project
would complement support to BRRI from other donors, especially staff training
to be provided by the Ford Foundation.
16.       The Government has agreed to ensure the availability of adequate
quantities of breeders seed from either BRRI or other sources. Once provided
with breeders seed, Government seed farms would produce all the foundation
seed and 5,400 tons (45 percent of the planned total) of certified seed.
These farms are operated by BADC, a semi-autonomous body under the Ministry
of Agriculture with responsibility for the import, production and distribution
of agricultural inputs, including seed. The 17 BADC farms selected for
inclusion under the project are in six groups, each serving one of the i_
seed processing centers. The project would finance required improvements
on these farms including: (a) irrigation through low-lift pumps and tubewells,
thereby allowing year-round seed production; (b) land levelling and drainage
works to improve water management; (c) improved roads to allow better access
to farm plots and from the farms to the seed processing centers; (d) farm
machinery including tractors, threshing equipment, and trucks, to insure
timely and intensive farm operations; (e) workshops and equipment for
repairs and maintenance of the machinery; (f) housing and transport for key
staff members; and (g) electrification and improved telecommunications.
17.       Private farmers in five different Contract Growers' Areas would
use BADC foundation seed to produce the rest of the certified seed planned
under the project (5,800 tons rice seed and 800 tons wheat seed). They
would be advised and closely supervised by specially-trained BADC staff
operating out of the seed processing centers. Farmers would be selected
for the program on the basis of their interest, farming ability and proximity
to roads. The growers would be grouped into blocks of about 10 acres based
on an existing pump group or primary cooperative. In return for the extra
effort involved in producing high quality seed, the contract growers would
receive a premium price (initially about 25 percent higher than the current
consumption grain price), free threshing and free transport of grain to
processing centers. To ensure proper handling, the BADC staff from the
seed processing centers would organize the threshing and transport from
the fields to the processing plants.
18.       The project would construct, equip, and staff six seed processing
centers with a total annual capacity of 12,000 tons of seed. Five of these
centers would also have staff for supervising the Contract Growers' Scheme
discussed above. For each plant, equipment would be procured to clean,
weigh, dry, store, treat and package the seed. Training in the operation
and maintenance of the equipment would be provided. Where possible, existing
seed stores would be used as sites for the seed processing plants. To
enable the project to begin at an early date, temporary processing equipment



would be installed initially. Later, when the more permanent and efficient
facilities are in operation, this temporary equipment would provide standby
capacity in case of breakdowns or unusually wet weather.
19.       Under the project, the Seeds Certification Agency (SCA) would be
established under the Ministry of Agriculture and provided with trained
staff and inspectors, a headquarters building, laboratories, land for seed
testing, and other facilities. The establishment of the SCA would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the credit. The SCA would play a crucial role in
monitoring the quality of the seed produced under the project.
20.       For distributing the seed, the project would use the network of
warehouses and dealerships already established by BADC to distribute fer-
tilizers. The amount of seed to be distributed is unlikely to exceed
2 percent of the amount of fertilizer distributed, so that the same network
of village shops and cooperatives could handle seed as well as fertilizers,
without the need for extra field staff. To provide for good storage
conditions, the project would provide for slight modifications of existing
thana-level warehouses. Tfhe project would also finance an intensive
extension, demonstration and promotion effort to demonstrate the superiority
of, and create a strong demand for, the project seed. This effort is
regarded as crucial in view of the past poor performance of BADC as a
seed supplier. For the same reason, the seeds woujld be sold initially at
a subsidized price, with the subsidies gradually removed so that at the end
of five years the price would cover the cost of producing and distributing
the seed.
Technical Assistance and Tralning
21.       Much of the project involves the strengthening of existing
institutions and their integration into a more effective system. To this
end, the project would provide for a major training and technical assistance
program. Local training would take place at the BADC Staff Training Insti-
tute, Madhupur, where extra classrooms, staff housing and demonstration
facilities would be provided and for which instructors would be recruited
and trained. Training of quality control staff would take place at SCA
headquarters at Joydebpur while training of processing staff would be
largely "in-service" and would be conducted by equipment suppliers. In
addition, the projec.t would finance short-term overseas training fellowships
and study visits abroad for key project personnel. The technical assistance
program would include resident specialists to be employed to help project
implementation. Their duties would include training, preparation of tender
documents, bid evaluation, supervision of construction and installation of
processing plants and assistance with other aspects of the project, including
RADC farm development and seed quality control. The appointment of certain of
these consultants needed in the early stages of project implementation is a
condition of effectiveness of the credit. In addition, specialists' services
would be provided to assist BRRI draw up site and architectural plans for the
building program and to help with planning and supervision of substation

development. Specialists' services are also provided for a feasibility study
during the third year of the project, to analyze the financial structure of
the BADC seed production and distribution system and to determine future size
and scope of further development of the seed industry in Bangladesh.
Project Benefits
22.       The principal quantifiable benefit of the praposed project would
come from increased grain production primarily due to the earlier introduction
and accelerated spread of new HYV to replace traditional varieties and, in
some cases, the older HYV. Based on a conservative estimate of only a
one-year acceleration in the spread of HYV, the project would increase paddy
and wheat production by an estimated 400,000 tons a year resulting in a
foreign exchange savings of US$25 million annually. Using current market
values for foreign exchange and labor, and projected 1980 world prices for
rice and wheat, the project yields a 70 percent rate of return. When tnadow
prices are applied to labor and foreign exchange, the rate of return rises
to over 100 percent. The benefits of increased production arising from the
seeds project alone are difficult to isolate precisely, since they assume a
modest complementary inputs package including fertilizer and pesticides. To
indicate the effects if supplies of these inputs were less than anticipated,
a sensitivity analysis was carried out. The sensitivity analysis indicates
that even if benefits are 25 percent less than anticipated, the rate of return
would be above 50 percent. If the benefits were 50 percent less, the rate
of return would still be above 30 percent. The unusually high rate of return
for this project is indicative of its catalytic effect on the overall develop-
ment of the agricultural sector. The project will, at a relatively low cost,
ensure the supply of a vitally needed high-yielding input. As noted above,
high-yielding seeds can be used by large and small farmers alike, and their
use generally requires the hiring of additional farm labor. Thus not only
are the returns of this project large, they are also likely to be spread across
all income groups.
Procurement and Disbursement
23.       Since preparation of this project, which is of such vital importance
to Bangladesh, has been greatly delayed by the civil strife of 1971, the
Association has encouraged the Bangladesh Government to procure processing
equipment and begin staff training abroad before approval of the project.
The proposed credit would therefore provide for retroactive financing of up
to a maximum of US$50,000 of expenditures made after February 1, 1973. With
one minor exception, all farm machinery, equipment and processing plants will
be procured through international competitive bidding. The exception would
consist of small items (including some motor vehicles, office equipment,
workshop tools and miscellaneous small tools and equipment) urgently required
at the beginning of the project and limited to a total value of US$40,000.
Contracts for construction of buildings would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding but are expected to go to local firms.
The remaining civil works (earthworks and irrigation on the BADC farms)



- 8 -
would be too small to attract international interest and would best be
carried out during slack seasons by labor already employed on the farms,
supplemented as necessary by additional hired labor or local contractors
selected after local competitive bidding. Local goods would receive a margin
of preference equal to 15 percent or the relevant customs duty, whichever
is less. Disbursements would be made against: 100 percent of foreign
expenditures (c.i.f.) or of local expenditures (ex-factory) for machinery
and equipment; 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for services of foreign
consultants; 70 percent of the total expenditures for the services of
local consultants; 100 percent of the total expenditures for training abroad;
and 50 percent of the cost of project civil works, local training, and seed
marketing and distribution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
25.       The draft agreement contains the salient provisions described in
the earlier parts of this report, including as additional conditions of
effectiveness those mentioned in paragraphs 13, 19 and 21 above, and the
establishment by the Government of revolving funds for use by BADC and BRRI
in carrying out the project. Otherwise it follows the usual pattern of
credits for similar projects.
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approved the proposed
development credit.

B. THE ECONOMY-
Background
1.        On December 16, 1971 the Government of Bangladesh assumed control
of the territory comprising the former East Wing of Pakistan. Even in the
best of circumstances Bangladesh would constitute a complex development
problem. The people are poor (per capita income of US$50 to US$70 per annum,
a figure which has not risen over the past 20 years), overcrowded (population
density is nearly 1,400 per square mile) and becoming more so (population
is growing at 3 percent per annum), short-lived (life expectancy at birth is
well under 50 years), in many cases unemployed (perhaps 25-30 percent), and
largely illiterate (under 20 percent literacy rate).
2.        The physical problems of Bangladesh -- its precarious environment,
lack of natural resources, and alluvial terrain with resultant high cost of
infrastructure -- have been compounded by poorly chosen and implemented
investment programs in the past. Perhaps the most striking failure lies
in the increasing gap between foodgrain production and requirements.
Bangladeshi, a predominantly agricultural country, must import about 15 per-
cent of its food requirements even in years of "normal" production such as
1969/70 when 1.5 million tons of foodgrains were imported. Bangladesh today
is one of the most extreme examples of rural poverty in the world.
3.        The year and a half in which the Government of Bangladesh has been
in control of the country has been dominated by the need to tackle the
urgent rehabilitation tasks arising out of the cyclone of November 1970 and
the political struggles and war of 1971.   First, law and order had to be re-
established, political stability achieved and the administrative framework
reconstituted. Second, refugees had to be resettled, relief provided and
the transport system reconstructed to permit the distribution of food. Third,
the economy had to be restored to pre-war levels of output and employment.
4.        Two of the principal achievements of the Government since indepen-
dence have been the progress towards restoration of law and order to the
ccuntrys-ide and the formulation of a new constitution.  The constitution
which came Into effect on December 16, 1972, provides for the establishment
of a parliamentary democracy in which the President is the constitutional
head of State and executive authlority is exercised by the Cabinet under
the Prime Alinister. Thne Cabinet collectively is responsible to Parliament,
which} contsists of 310 me,,uters elected by the people from single territorial
constituencies by direct election. The first parliamentary elections were
held in March 1973.
5.        Most of the refugees have been resettled, relief has been provided
and the widely feared famine has not materialized, thanks in part to massive
assistance initially from India and subsequently from a number of other
countries, mostly under the auspices of UNROD (United Nations Relief
Operation in Dacca). The port of Chittagong was restored to 90 percent of
its prewar capacity by the end of last June. The roads were quickly repaired
1/   Taken, with slight modification, from paragraphs 3-22 of the Report and
Recommendation to the Executive Directors on an Education Project
(IDA/R73-60) dated May 29, 1973.

and ferries brought in to substitute for damaged bridges. The vital bhairab
bridge which links Chittagong to Dacca by rail will not, however, be usable
till October 1973. The reconstruction process is now well in hand and aid
commitments have been received for meeting the most urgent needs.
Food and Other Production
6.        The gravest problem confronting the Government since independence
has been the food situation. The 1970/71 crops were poor and the aman crop
of December 1971 was disrupted by the war. Record levels of food imports of
about 2.5 million tons in 1972 have prevented famine from occurring. Never-
theless, per capita foodgrain availabilities in 1972 were well below 1969/70
levels and this, combined with the internal transport difficulties, wide-
spread hoarding, and smuggling of foodgrains to India, led to a 50 percent
rise in prices over the year. By October 1972 it was apparent that the
monsoon had been exceptionally poor and that a critical situation was likely
to develop once again. According to preliminary assessments the main rice
crop was 20 percent lower than the original estimates. Even assuming that
the winter rice crop is satisfactory, there will still be a total foodgrain
import requirement of at least 2.5 million tons in 1973.
7.        Non-agricultural sectors have also been slow to recover.    Indus-
trial activity came to a virtual standstill from November 1971 to January
1972. Since then, production in general seems to have returned to about
70 percent of pre-war levels, though there is considerable variation among
industries. Many industries have experienced serious shortages of raw
materials (such as cotton, yarn, chemicals and cement), spare parts and
capital goods. In large part this is due to the disruption of trade both
during the war and subsequently, with new Government licensing and importing
institutions not operating effectively. In addition industrial production
has been affected by a variety of problems ranging from lack of demand
(especially for those industries formerly exporting to West Pakistan) to labor
problems. Low output, combined with the Government's inability to get a
substantial amount of imported consumer goods flowing into the country, has
been a major factor contributing to the rapid price increases.
Trade
8.        One of the first acts of the Government was to devalue the taka
by 53 percent at official rates, to establish it at par with the Indian
rupee. The bonus voucher system for exports was removed and this, combined
with the devaluation, had the important effect of offering a higher
effective exchange rate for raw jute and a somewhat lower rate for locally
manufactured jute goods. Exports increased fairly rapidly after the
resumption of trade in February 1972. The recovery was made possible by the
existence of large inventories of jute and jute products at a time when the
prices fetched on world markets still reflected the severe shortages of
1971. As 1972 wore on, there were reminders of the difficult world m      c
position of jute, with clear evidence of European raw jute importers switching
to synthetics and of declining demand. As a result, jute exports are
projected at US$325 million in 1972/73 as against US$350 million in 1969/70.



ANiNEX I
Page 4
Total exports of the country over the year are projected at about US$375
million, which compares with about US$500 million exported to West Pakistan
and third countries in the pre-war period. Most of this decline is on
account of items such as tea, matches, fish and paper products which were
formerly exported to West Pakistan.
The First Annual Plan
9.        In July 1972 the first budget and Annual Plan were presented.
The Plan proposed some US$430 million of public development expenditure
and a further US$160 million for reconstruction. About half of the develop-
ment expenditure was for agriculture, rural institutions, and water and
flood control. The Plan is a pragmatic document which aims at restoring
economic activity to the pre-war level. Even so, the projected amounts of
development expenditure represent a sizeable increase from the past and
there is likely to be a considerable shortfall. The level of imports (and
the consequent foreign aid disbursements) which is assumed in the Plan,
may not be achieved in 1972/73, leading to shortfalls in revenues from
customs duties and counterpart funds. The budgetary situation is very
closely tied to indirect taxation and this in turn is dependent on foreign
trade levels. Pressing budgetary needs have had to be met through an
expansion in the money supply of 82 percent between January and December
1972. This has combined with commodity shortages to cause the serious price
problems, which because of their political implications loom largest in
short-term economic concerns of the Government at present.
Priorities for Growth
10.       The elections of March 1973 and the publication of the Five--Year
Plan expected for June signal the end of the "reconstruction" phase and
the beginning of the Government's attempt to come to grips with the long-
term development problems. The authorities will be faced with a host of
fundamental decisions concerniing policies and programns. The Plan will
provide the basis for analysing the quantitative dimensions of the develop-
ment problem. The following is an attempt to delineate the issues in
general terms, drawn mainly from the Economic Report on Bangladesh.
Ht.       Perhaps the highest priority attaches to gearing up the economic
administration to prepare and implement development projects in a manner
quite different from the past. While the Planning Commission is now
techdically well prepared to devise economic plans, the need for effective
coordination and improved project preparation and implementation has not
yet been met. The operating ministries and autonomous institutions, which
were already weak, were in many cases weakened still further as a result
of changes in key personnel during 1971 and the unsettled period in early
1972. It will be necessary to face these problems squarely, identify the
gaps in personnel and prepare for the combination of training and technical
assistance which will be necessary to close these gaps.
12.       The urgent need to engineer a rapid and visible improvement in
rural living standards points to a rapid expansion of programs related to



ANNEX I
Page 5
rural development. These programs are central to future development, and
development activities in all sectors should be designed to reflect the
crucial importance of rural development. The programs evolved at the
Comilla Academy for Rural Development are especially promising and deserving
of support.
13.       In view of the great technical difficulties arising in the
construction of large-scale water control projects, Bangladesh's urgent need
to increase food production requires emphasis to be placed initially on
less ambitious projects with greater immediate impact in increasing yields.
Emphasis should be placed upon: improved distribution of inputs; appropriate
pricing policies for both inputs and agricultural products; much more
research than hitherto on developing new varieties, improved methods of
cultivation, input requirements and alternative cropping possibilities;
attention to such currently neglected areas as livestock production and
fisheries; encouragement to private investment in agriculture; and extel- '-on
of credit facilities to smallholders.
14.       Products such as leather goods, fish and paper products are
minor export items at present, but represent possible growth opportunities
for the economy. A proper system of incentives for these and new export
items needs to be considered. Marketing and promotion activities need to
be undertaken both to redirect the products formerly exported to West
Pakistan and to increase and diversify exports.
15.       There is no easy way to increase public savings in the short-run.
A program of taxation needs to be drawn up which will be elastic to growth
in income. An essential element in any such program will be the efficient
operation and economic pricing of public utilities and enterprises. There
should be flexibility and experimentation to provide financial incentives
to management and labor, and improved financial reporting to enable
authorities to make necessary changes.
16.       Programs with a high employment content should be emphasized.
The rural works program has the potential for creating productive infra-
structure in the rural areas, through hiring seasonally unemployed workers;
small-scale industries can have an impact on both output and employment if
promotion, financing and incentives are adequate; and the high labor
content of jute production increases the importance of efforts to keep jute
price competitive.
17.       The education system, based on traditional models, has over-
emphasized theoretical formal education and has been excessively concentrated
in urban areas. Education must be reoriented towards a better-educated
rural population and skilled manpower in the modern sector. Proposals for
mass education have been put forward which, while far from being fully
worked out, represent a step in the right direction. The deterioration of
quality in higher education and the divorce of the universities from the
real development situation are problems requiring urgent attention.



ANNEX I
Page 6
18.       The population will double by the year 2000 if present growth rates
are maintained. The population control program needs a completely new
approach with proper political backing and a sense of real urgency. It must
be not merely the particular program of one department, but a concern
permeating the entire administration.
External Aid and Growth
19.       Bangladesh will require large and continuing external assistance
to achieve an acceptable growth rate. Long-term projections suggest that,
even to maintain the existing per capita income level in the face of
continued population growth, net aid disbursements of between US$100 million
and US$200 million per annum would be required. Aid disbursement levels of
about US$300 million would permit imports of only about US$700 million,
which, given the higher foodgrain component, would allow for no more invest-
ment goods and raw materials than were imported in 1969/70 into the area
that became Bangladesh. Average aid disbursements of US$500 million per
year over the five-year plan period would be required to permit imports to
be maintained at a level of US$900 million and the rate of investment at
the 12-15 percent of GDP figure which is needed for a 5 percent per annum
growth of GDP. There is little prospect for substantial domestic financing
of investment in the short-term given the depressed levels of incomne. In
time, of course, the substitution of domestically grown foodgrains for
imports would release foreign exchange for expanded capital and raw materials
imports.
20.       Aid disbursements this year and next are likely to be limited
by the capacity to import efficiently rather than by inadequate commitment
levels. Commitments, which were at about US$1.3 billion as of the end of
1972, have been extremely high, reflecting the sympathetic response from
donors to the needs of the critical food situation and reconstruction
program. While levels of aid commitments during the next few years will
certainly be lower, it is essential for disbursements to be maintained well
above pre-war levels if Bangladesh is to make any significant progress in
raising living standards.
21.       With arn adequate said flow and better economic management,
Bangladesh should certainly improve on past growth rates.    A sustained
growth rate of close to 5 percent should be possible, although it would
need good fortune as well as exceptionally good management to get above
that level given the unfavorable ratio of population to resources. The
keys to growtlh will probably be increased agriculture production on the
one hand, and good export performance on the other. A sustained rate of
growth of 5 percent would mean that by the end of the century the majority
of the population could be adequately, if simply, fed, housed, clothed and
educated. Given the difficult circumstances of Bangladesh, even this would
be a major achievement.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Cr. No. 339    Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; $25.0 Million
Credit of October 18, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. Implementation
of the original project, financed under Credit No. 228-PAK of 1971, did
not commence prior to the suspension of disbursements. The Government has
now set up the central organization for the project, and task forces for
the execution of the sub-projects are being assembled. Sites for cyclone
shelters are being selected, tenders for construction have been invited,
and the Project Coordinator is hopeful of completing sixty shelters before
the onset of the monsoon season. On the primary roads sub-project, surveyors
are in the field determining alignments and making detailed assessments
of work quantities. On the Cyclone Warning sub-project, the sub-project
manager is finalizing specifications of equipment which must be imported
to strengthen the meteorological stations serving the coastal area. Other
sub-projects (inland water transport, telecommunications,, feeder roads, and
coastal fisheries) are less advanced. A supervision mission in March 1973
has reviewed with Government the actions required to expedite implementation
of these sub-projects.
Cr. No. 340    Chandpur Irrigation II Project; $13.0 Million Credit of
October 18, 1972; Closing Date:   December 31_, 177
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. When work on
the project, previously financed under Credit No. 184-PAK of 1970, was
suspended in 1971, the major project civil works were about half completed.
The contractor manufacturing equipment for the regulators had also made
substantial progress. Interim financing by Sweden allowed reappointment
of project consultants, resumption of construction and renegotiation of the
contract for manufacture and installatioui of the equipment for Lihe regulators.
Cr. No. 341    Tubewells Project; $14.0 Million Credit of November 6,
1972; Closing Date; December 31, 197
The project is also being assisted by a $6 million credit from
Sweden and a $6 million grant from Canada. The IDA and Swedish credits
became effective on January 17, 1973.   The project was originally financed
bv IDA Credit No. 108-PAK of 1970 and credits from Sweden and Canada. Bids
for the drilling of project wells had been received in 1971 but no contracts
were awarded due to the disturbed conditions.   Interim financing from Sweden

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken

permitted reappointment of project consultants and retendering. Bids
have been received for well drilling and supply of pumps and engines for the
wells, and contracts are expected to be awarded in the next few weeks.
Contracts have been awarded for required vehicles and miscellaneous equip-
ment.
Cr. No. 343    Telecommunications Project; $7.3 Million Credit of
November 15, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Credit became effective January 17, 1973. The project was
originally financed as part of Credit No. 145-PAK of 1969, and goods and
services valued at about US$2.2 million were received in Dacca prior to
suspension of disbursements. Orders had also been placed for the remaining
equipment now to be financed under Credit No. 343, and the suppliers are
understood to be prepared to resume work at the original contract prices.
Cr. No. 345    Reconstruction Imports Project; $50.0 Million CreuciL
of November 30, 1972; Closing Date: August 31, 1974
Credit became effective January 30, 1973. The Government has
prepared a statement allocating the proceeds of the Credit among the various
eligible categories of expenditure, taking into account funds expected to
be available from other sources of assistance. Letters of credit guaranteed
by IDA have been opened for US$6.2 million and disbursements are expected
to commence shortly.
Cr. No. 353    Small-Scale Industry Project; $3.0 Million Credit of
January 19, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
