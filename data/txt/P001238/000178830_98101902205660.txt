INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPXK T ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENIITION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SEOOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Kenya for the equivalent of US$21.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Livestock Development
Project. Approximately $18 million would be relent to the Agricultural
Finance Corporation (AFC) for twenty years including five years of grace
with interest at three percent per annum. AFC would onlend these funds to
final beneficiaries at eight percent per annum.  Canada, the United King-
dom and the United States are ex=ected to make commitments for grants and
credits totalline about $13.L million to help finance the ProJect.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Second Decade: A Basic Economic Report
on Kenya" (Report No. 201-KE, dated January 15, 1974) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on February 20, 1974.  An agricultural sector
survey report on Kenya (Report No. 254-UE) was distributed. oh March 13, 1974.
A special economic mission visited Kenya in February 1974 to review the
economy's prospects and aid requirements in the light of the changes in
commodity prices including increased oil prices. A summary statement of
the present position of the Kenya economy and the prospects for the future was
presented in the President's Report on a Tea Factory Project dated May I,
1974 and is attached as Annex 1 to this report,together with countrAr.dta
sheets.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO KENYA
3.        Kenya has to date received ten Bank loans and fourteen IDA
credits amounting to $139.1 million and 6 98.7 million, respectively.
In addition, Kenya has been one of the beneficiaries of nine loans
totalling $229.8 million which have been extended for the development
of common services (railways, ports, telecommunications and finance for
industry) operated regionally for the three Partner States of the East
African Community -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Bank Group operations
were reviewed in the President's Repoirt dated May l,>  1974 on a proposed
loan for a Tea Factory project and is attached in Annex II to this
report. Annex II also contains summary statements of Bank loans and
IDA credits to Kenya and the East African Community organizations, a
summary of IFC investments in Kenya and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.



-2-
PART III - THiE AG I31T-JRA' SECTOR
4.        Agriculture is the most important sector of the Kenya economy.
It ;rovides the livelihood of some 11 million people (over 90dp of the total popu-
lation), generates over 60% of foreign exchange earnings and contributes over
30D of GDP. Agricultural production also contributes significantly to industrial
activity by providing commodities for processing; and increasing cash crop pro-
duction is widening the rural market for manufactured goods.
Kenyan agriculture embraces outdated techniques and low productivity
as well as highly developed agricultural technology. Widely ranging types of
climate, soil and topography produce a diverse pattern of larnd utilization
and cropping. Although Kenya has a relatively large land mass (583,ooo km2),
only about 18% of this total is classified as of medium or high agricultural
potential. Within this small area, populatior pressure is high and rising.
Agricultural activity is concentrated mainly in the southwestern quadrant of the
country, There are about 3,000 medium to large farms in Kenya, and approximaately
1.2 mill-on small farms, about half of which are less than two hectares in size.
Many farms are still at a subsistence level, and some rural households are facing
extremely hard conditions, particularly those in the less favored areas and on very
small holdings. However, an increasing number of rural families are now established
commercial farmers, using improved seeds, fertilizer and other inputs.
6.        Subsistence produce, consumed directly by farmers and their families,
makes up over 50% of total agricultural output, Corn (maize) is the major sub-
sistence crop, although it is produced on a commercial basis as well. Other
subsistence crops include millet, cassava, potatoes, plantains and bananas.
Commercial production for export focuses on coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum and
wattle, although cashew nuts, pineapples, castor beans, coconuts and wool are
becoming increasingly important. Wheat, rice, sugar and cotton are produced
largely as cash crops, but are almost totally consumed within the country.
'ihile meat and dairy products continue to be significant in subsistence agriculture,
a growing proportion of the livestock produced is marketed domestically or
exported. Although the land is suitable for sugar cane and oil seed production,
Kenya still imports a significant portion of her sugar and oils and fats
requirements.
7e        Before 1950 the commercial sector of agriculture was Margely confined
to the area of ]uropean settlements, but increasing African participation in the
market economy has eradicated the historical dichotomy whereby European farming
was for the market while African farming was for subsistence. Even the distinction
between large and small units of production no longer serves as the dividing
line between cash and subsistence sectors, as many small farmers are now
producing crops for sale as well as for their own consumption, and many of the
large farms are operated as cooperatives or t"co3npanytu farms in multiple
ownership producing both food and cash crops.
8.        The Government's main objective is to increase and diversify export
crop production, raise subsistence levels and cash incomes of farmers and
attain agricultural self-sufficiency. Agricultural development is controlled and
guided by an elaborate and complex network of government organizations and
semi-public bodies that establish many of the conditions under which production
takes place. The Ministry of Agriculture is primarily concerned with setting
overall policy including pricing policy and providing general support services,
such as research, extension and training.   It also exercises control over a wide



-3-
range of specialized production and marketing boards and agencies.   Other
ministries such as Lands and Settlement, Cooperatives and Social Services,
Tourism and Wildlife, Natural Resources and wiorks are responsible for other
services in the agricultural sector.
9.        Although impressive progress has been made over the last decade,
especially in the introduction of cash crops into the smallholder sector, the
recent basic economic report has suggested that agricultural development needs
lo be accelerated still further to help alleviate three particularly sensitive
and critical problems: pover-ty, unemployment, and emerging constraints on the
balance of payments.
10.       While comparative statistics of per capita income indicate that Kenya
has developed further than many of her neighbors, the impression of relative pros-
perity conveyed by such figures is partly illusory.   The relatively poor rural
population is ten times larger than the relatively well-off urban population.
Average rural income has been estimated as being under $60 per head, and, even
within the rural sector, disparities are great, Most rural dwellers live at sub-
sistence levels, and many of them still have only limited access to health care
and education.
11.       Meanwhile, Kenya's present economic structure is hard pressed to absorb
its rapidly increasing labor force, and agriculture-based production and processing
is crucial in alleviating the serious unemployment problem. Rural employment is ham-
pered by a growing scarcity of good land, rapid population growth and the difficulty
of settling landless people across tribal boundaries.
12.       Finally, recent adverse trends in world markets, exacerbated by the oil
crisis, have made it all the more important for Kenya to expand the foreign exchange
earnings required to support her ambitious development efforts.   While Kenya is
waking every effort to explore alternatives for export, the country will continue
to depend very heavily on increased earnings from agriculture, especially from the
two major crops -- tea and coffee -- which togetner account for about t5% of mer-
chandise export earnings.
13.       The recent agriculture sector survey report suggests that agricultural
development will determine in large measure the welfare of the economy as a whole
for many years to come. Smallholder production, in particular, needs special
encouragement, including help from the Government and its parastatal organiza-
tions in planning and implementing programs for smallholder development. The
Bank Group's strategy for the agricultural sector is designed to improve income
earning potentials for the poor segment of the rural population and accelerate
production levels in beef and a variety of crops including maize, wheat, sugar a;>'
cotton.
The Livestock Subsector
1a.       Kenya has an abundance of land suitable for beef production, much of
which is at present underutilized.  Approximately 80% of Kenya's land is semi-arid
or arid rangeland suitable for herds of wild and domestic animals. One of the



- 1 -
major constraints to f^uller utilization of the arangeland is the lack of water
and most of the rivers and wa--erhole3 uha-G do exist are seasonal.  Consequently,
land tends to be over-grazed in the vircinity of the available watering points and
under-grazed in other parts. Underground wadter is available in many areas but more
use could be made df seasonal rainfall by constructing small dams and reeervoirs.
15.         The Ilivestock population is made up of about 9.5 million head of
cattle and about 8 million sheep and goats. Less than 10% of the cattle are
on large-scale commercial ranches. At present these cattle provide the main
source of high quality beef for export which makes up 8% of the valuie of Kenya's
total commodity exports.  The cattle population is about eqiallydi6tributed
between the sparsely populated rangelarnds and the densely populated agricultural
areas. In the dry rangelands cattle are the principal source of income for the
nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, who market the cattle through commercial chan-
nels. Cattle from these areas, mainly from the Northeast, travel along routes
with inadequate feed and water supplies and consequently undergo severe weight
loss. In the populated agricultural areas cattle is kept primarily for subsis-
tence; the extent of home consumption is illustrated by the fact that only about
380,000 head of cattle are marketed through commercial channels, while 800,000
are slaughtered annually. However, some of these herds are also kept for commer-
cial production to supplement income from cash and subsistence crops. As milk
is a major subsistence food, the proportion of cows in most herds is high.
16.         Animal husbandry in the pastoral areas displays all the attributes of
traditional peasant agriculture. Cattle, often regarded as just a stock of wealth
and prestige, are individually owned but grazed on communal land which
often becomes over-grazed. Productivity is low, tick-borne diseases cause consi-
derable losses, and foot-and-mouth disease (M)j_ is endemic over large areas. How-
ever, there are indications that attitudes are changing and that pastoralists
are adopting a more commercial approach to livestock.
17.         The Government has proposed an ambitious program for developing the
livestock sector. It comprises:
(a)    establishing large-scale ranching enterprises to encourage
livestock production on the rangelands for traditional producers;
(b)    improving marketing facilities to enable movement of cattle with
minimal loss of weight and spreading of diseases;
(c)    eradicating and controlling diseases which are endemic in certain
regions;
(d)    constructing adequate processing and storage facilities;
(e)    providing technical and credit facilities to assist the small-
scale producer; and
(f)    removing price controls which have discouraged beef production
and caused market distortions.
Ranching Development
18.         The great bulk of pastoral land of Kenya is held in trust by the local
County Councils for the benefit of the peopole who traditionally lived on or had
access to these lands. With the growing population pressures more people have
rights to use the communally owned land than it can sustain, and overgrazing is
common. Unleas an individual or an association of individuals are given exclus. ve



-5-
rights to a particular piece of land, they have neither the incentive nor the
rig,ht to control grazing or disease and improve the productivity of their livestock.
Modernization of the ranching industry also requires credit but this can only be
obtained with security, such as legal title to land. Thus, both modernization and
preservation of the rangelands rely in large measure upon the granting of legal
title. To resolve the conflict of communal ownership and to increase production
on the rangelands, the Government is encouraging traditional pastoralists to form
themselves into large groups or associations.
19.         Group ranches are production enterprises in which a group of up to
100 families collectively hold title to land, maintain agreed stocking levels and
jointly market surplus yet continue to own their livestock as individuals, Group
ranching has been introduced primarily among the Masai where tribal organization
anci conservative values predominate. It is designed to accommodate traditional
pastoralists, who, with their strong pride of ownership in their cattle, have a
desire for development but little commercial experience. The group, being jointly
liable for the debts services the loan and charges the individual cattle
owner on the basis of the number of cattle he owns.  The cattle owner then receives
the profCit from the sale of his own animals after debt service and a charge for
common expenditures. A committee of group members and local governmient officials
determines the operating policies. which are implemented by ranch managers either
employed by the group or provided by the Government.
'0.         Company or cooperative ranches are enterprises in which a large number
small livestock owners form themselves into a company or cooperative and lease
and from the Government to establish a ranch. The prospective shareholders or
rmmbers put up cattle or a cash equivalent for shares in the company or obtain
membership in the cooperative. Animals are collectively owned and disposed of,
and profits are shared according to an established agreement. Paid management
operates the ranch under direction fron the Board of Directors.  This type of
ranching is particularly suitable for areas of higher population density where
small farmers keep some livestock mainly for subsistence purposes but have experi-
ence in the monetized sector from cash croDs. Many of these farviers occupy large
areas of adjacent lanid,which, but for water facilities,could be well utilized.
With appropriate inputs, they are easily encouraged to develop cooperative or com-
pany ranches.
21.         Commercial ranches are owned by one or more persons on freehold land
and comprise the most advanced sector of the beef cattle industry. They supply
the bulk of quality beef for domestic consumption and export. Though originally
established by European settlers, ownership has gradually passed to  'rica-r, ind_-
viduals or groups, a process much assisted by a million acres scheme f-nancad b-y
the U.K. Many of these ranches now need capital and better management to improve
productivity.



Livestock Movement and Yiarketing
22.         Large areas of the arid and sparsely populated rangeland are devoted
almost entirely to breeding operations.  But erdemic diseases in most regions,
inadequate stock routes and holding grounds and the lack of regular markets are
three principal constraints to regular rmovement of cattle from the producing to
the main processing and consuming areas.
23.         The Livestock Marketirig Division (LMD) of the Ministry of Agriculture
is responsible for ensuring thaG range lilvestock producers have access to markets
and that the ranchers receive an assured supply of feeder cattle. The existing
livestiock markete stock routes and holding grounds are owned and operaued by the
LXiX  In areas where  these    facilities are inadequate or non-existent, the LED
hopes to upgrade them  by providing essential infrastructure.   Cattle are sold at
auctions organized by the LMD, mbst of which are held in the main surplus
area -- the Northeast.  IMD is the major buyer; for example, in 1972 it
purchased about 18% of the total cattle marketed in the country. The LND recovers
costs through fees for the use of its facilities.
Animal Health
24.         The major animal disease problems in Kenya include trypanosemiasis,
East Coast fever and other tick-borne disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Rinderpest, once a major problem, has now
been almost com?letely eliminated by a compulsory vaccination program. Pleuro-
pneumonia, though endemic in the Northeast, has been prevented from spreading to
other areas by strict government control on livestock movement and by vaccination
and quarantine of all marketed animals. The other major diseases are also well
controlled.
25.         FMD is widespread and represents an important constraint to the export
of chilled and frozen meat to Europe. The disease is endemic in the main pastoral
regions of the country and outbreaks are controlled by restrictions on stock move-
ment.  The disease causes only slight production losses in indigenous Zebu cattle,
but crossbred cattle in the higher rainfall areas are far more susceptible and their
protection by vaccination and movement control is desirable. In the central areas
of the country, where the bulk of the exotic crossbreeds are located, the disease
has been largely eliminated by a program of bi-annual vaccination and a large disease
free zone established. Regulations of some of the major importing countries pre-
scribe that imported carcass meat must come from an PM free zone. The FMD contrcl
policy in Kenya is to minimize the FMD threat in the existing control areas and
mount new vaccination campaigns in those areas with a rapidly increasing number of
high-quality cattle.
26.         Disease problems are serious, but the high death losses and low herd
productivity are mainly attributable to nutritional rather than disease causes,
Periodic droughts and malnutrition cause high mortality and limit the productivity
of stock. Thus, to increase cattle numbers and 6fftake rates improved dry season
watering facilities, better grazing management, the stratification of breedinnz and
fattening areas and, when' practical, protein and phosphorous supplements will be
required together with extended disease control. To add weight to immature and
unfinished animals, pastures should be improved and more feedlots established.



-7-
Meat Processing
27.         Of the 800,000 head of cattle slaughtered annually in Kenya, local
butchers and individuals slaughter approximately 60% for home consumption,
abbatoirs owned by local authorities another 10%, and the Kenya Meat Comnission
(KMC),the balance of 30%.
28.         The KMC owns and operates the two large meat processing facilities,
the Athi River and Mombasa plants, and is the most important channel for marketing
beef in Kenya.  KMC has a monopoly over exports of meat and meat products, and
about 50% of its total production is exported. Although the Athi River plant is
within the FkD free zone, proximity to areas where FMD is endemic makes it diffi-
cult to maintain its disease free export status. KMC s expansion plans therefore
call for the construction of a new plant within a few years situated in the disease
free zone catering solely for the export market.
Government Services
29.         Responsibility for agricultural services rests with the Ministry of
Agriculture. The Range Management Division of the Ministry of Agriculture is
adequately staffed with about 360 professional technical employees and receives
substantial assistance from USAID range advisors and FAO/UNDP specialists. In
addition to field and extension activities, the Division is also charged with
responsibility for initiating research on rangelands. The Range Water Division,
which also receives considerable technical assistance from USAID, is responsible
for water supplies to range areas. The Department of Veterinary Services is
actively involved in implementing a program for control of diseases which limit
cattle movement and production. Education and training services under the responsi-
Jility of the Training Division have recently been expanded, and sufficient vet-
erinary graduates are being trained in the University of Nairobi, which now also
provides degree training in General Agriculture.  Training centers for farmers are
operated in every district of Kenya; however, due to lack of funds, these institu-
tions cannot operate a;; capacity.  Thus, the training program reaches only a small
number of farmers. There is no university degree level training in animal hus-
bandry, and range management and supp7 smental staff will continue to be trained or
recruited overseas.
Agricultural Credit
30.         The Kenya banking system consists of a Central Bank, seven commercial
banks, the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), the Cooperative Bank and
several statutory boards for specific crops. The Central Bank exercises little
control over agricultural lending except by setting the prime interest rate.   Tho
commercial banking system as of March 30, 1973 had total advances of KSh. 2W48
million, of which 10% was direct lending for agriculture to about 7,500 farmers
and agro-industrial corporations. The Cooperative Bank's loans amounted to KSh.
15 million at June 30, 1971, of which about KSh. 8 million was provided for
production finance.  Certain statutory boards provide credit in kind to 75,000
farmers for the production of crops for which they are the single marketing channel.
Apart from these, AFC is the main credit channel for small and medium-scale farmers0
AFC, a statutory body, provides medium and long-term secured credit for agricul-
tural development and works closely with the Ministry of Agriculture on -atters of
policy and in field work. AFC financing is prov ided mainly by Government in the



form of ecuity and loan capital   As of March 31, 1971, AFC advances were
about XSh. 200 million to some 14,000 farmers. Interest rates on agricultural
credit are in line with those for other purposes.  Commercial banks charge 8% to
9% and AFC 8%; cooperative members are charged 10% by their societies.
310         Only about 10% of the one million farmers are presently served by
inst-tuvional credit,  If a significant number of farmers are to be reached,
the credit structure will need to be reorganized. An IDA Credit made in No-ember
1972 for agricultural credit for smallholders (Credit No. 344-KE), includes funds
for an in-depth survey of the demand for and supply of credit, the pctential par-
ticipation of other institutions in addition to AFC, credit constraints and how
they can be removed and lending priorities.  This study is expected to be com-
p'eted in 1975.
Price Policy
32.         The entire beef price structure (retail, wholesale and producer) is
controlled by the Government. On average, the retail prices are about 25% below
export levels. Such low controlled prices have caused severe distortion in the
-narket. Supply has been deDressed, and beef has been diverted from the lucrative
exoort market to satisfy domestic demand. Recognizing this distorted market situ-
ation, the Government has undertaken to review the grading and pricing structure
and phase out price controls over the next three years. (Section 4.03 of
the draft De-velopment Credit Agreement). This will serve to (i) avoid substantial
loss of export earnings; (ii) provide adequate incentives for producers; (iii) en-
courage the development of beef substitutes -- poultry, pig and sheep -- and (iv) les-
sen the rural subsidy to urban consumers.
Wildlife
33.         The variety and abundance of Kenya's wildlife, which is protected with-
in the national parks and game reserves, is the focal point of tourism; an activity
which yields over 15% of Kenya's foreign exchange earnings. The movement and grazing
patterns of the game are seasonal in nature; they move in and out of the game
reserves as water and grazing vary. Although wildlife and domestic animals are in
some respects complementary in their utilization of rangelands, owing to their dif-
ferent grazing and browsing behavi..or, they often compete for the same scarce food
and water resources. There are also negative interactions through disease trans-
mission and predation. There is, therefore, an inherent conflict in the planned
development of rangeland. for beef production and wildlife conservation.  The con-
flict is of immediate concern in the vicinity of national parks and game reserves,
where rangelands are being adjudicated and ranching enterprises established.  Wild-
life will be endangered in many areas unless their unrestricted movement over these
r-angelands is assured.  The Government intends to alleviate the problem by providing
alternative water supplies outside the wildlife reserves in order to control the
movement of livestock into game areas, and by compensating ranch owners for permit-
ting wildlife on their property,
ITmact of the First Livestock Development Project (Credit No. 129-KE)
The first Livestock Development Project was jointly financed in 1968 by
--IDA credit of $3,6 million and a Swedish credit of $3.6 million. The principal



- 9 -
objective of that project was to increase beef production by development of
ranching enterprises, marketing facilities, range water facilities and disease
control. Under the project, credit was extended for the first time to tradi-
tional pastoralists.
35.       The organization and management of the project was entrusted to
the Ranch Loan Section of AFC. This arrangement was cumbersome and led to a
slow start. In addition, there were problems in recruiting qualified staff,
legal difficulties with land titles and delays in astablishing a credit system
for group and company ranches. Some of these difficulties were not entirely
unexpected in view of the pioneering nature of the project.
36.       In spite of the slow start;, the momentum gained during 1971 has led
to a rapid commitment of ranch development funds, and the credit is expected to
be fully disbursed by December 31, 1974, about a year later than estimated at
the time of appraisal.
37.       Performance on the whole has been satisfactory.  The pastoralists in
the Northeast have greatly berefitted from the improved marketing as evidenced
by LMD increasing its cattle Furchases from 15,000 head in 1968/69 to 50,000
head in 1971/72. Field visits indicate that the ranchers have derived finan-
cial benefits at least as great as forecast at the time of appraisal. The
semi-nomadic cattle owners have shown willingness to participate in group and
company ranches, as have also small livestock owners forming companies to own
and operate commercial ranches in the higher potential areas. The considerable
achievement and success of this project has encouraged the Government and our-
selves to prepare the proposed large, comprehensive and ambitious second phase
project, which in large part continues operations started in the first project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       A report (No. 193-KE) dated May 9, 1974 entitled "Appraisal of Second
Livestock Development Project - Kenya" is being circulated separately. A Credit
and Project Summary are provided as Annex III to this report.
39.       The project was appraised in the field in November 1972. Negotiations
for the proposed credit were held in Washington in July 1973. The Kenya dele-
gation was headed by Mr. J. Kibe, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture.
Representatives of the other financing partners (paragraph 42) attended the
negotiations as observers.  Completion of financing arrangements for the project
has delayed the presentation of this project.
40.       The proposed project constitutes the bulk of Kenya's livestock develcp-
ment program for the next five years. It is a broadly-based integrated livestock
development program, which reflects the Government's strategy for developing this
subsector (paragraph 17) and is designed to support all aspects of beef produccion
and marketing.  It includes elements specifically tailored to benefit the tradi-
tional small livestock owners, to enhance the export earnings of the sector anQ



- 10 -
to ar,melforate the irherent 3onflict between ranching development and wildlife
conservation.  -;t comprises:
(a)  establishment and/or improvement of about 60 group ranches,
100 commercial ranches, 20 company and cooperative ranches
and three feedlots;
(b)  improvement of about 7 million acres of communal grazing land
in the NorthEastern Province and about 3 million acres in the
Isiolo District through provision of water facilities and access
roads;
(c)  establishment of 31 new cattle markets, three markets for sheep
and goats, 30 new holding grounds and the improvement of existing
holding grounds and stock routes;
(d) provision of cattle transporters;
(e) development of three wildlife areas and provision for a wildlife
and livestock census and monitoring service;
(f) provision of technical services for training, research, project
monitoring and future project preparation; and
(g) provision of studies of the entire meat processing industry to
determine the location and timing of further processing facilities.
Project Costs and Financing Plan
)11.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$59.7 million equivalent.
The estimated foreign exchange component of $18.9 million equivalent (32% of total
cost) and $16.0 million eQuivalent of local costs would be financed extern all.
The proposea external financing of $3h.9 million would cover 59X of the totacosts;
the remaining hl% being provided by the Government and the ranchers.
42.       Because IDA resources are limited we approached with the full agreement
and cooperation of the Government, a number of donor countries to enlist financial
support for the project. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has
in principle agreed to recommend Canadian financing of not less than $2.4 million
for rangeland development and wildlife censusing and monitoring studies; the United
Kingdom Overseas Development Ministry is recommending that its Government finance
the livestock marketing component in an amount of not less than $3.7 million equiva-
lent, and the United States Agency for International Development will recommend
financing of not:less than $7.3 million for water and ranch development and
technical studies. These funds are being made available as grants or as loans on
IDA type terms. An IDA credit of $21.5 million would assist in financing ranch and
feedlot development, wildlife areas development, research and technical services and
project management. Finalization of the co-financing arrangements would be a con-
dition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit (Section 8.01(c) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).



Organization and Execution
L,.       Drawing on the lessons learned from the first project (paragraph 35),
overall responsibility for the coordination and implementation of the proposed
project would be vested in a special Coordination Unit created within the Miniis-
try of Agriculture. (Section 3.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
The Unit is headed by a senior Kenyan Project Coordinator appointed by the Minister
of Agriculture and reporting to the Director of Agriculture. In addition, the Unit
has an Assistant Project Coordinator who is an agricultural economist. The Govern-
ment has undertaken that sufficient supporting staff would be made available to the
Unit which in addition to project implementation would be responsible for project
related investigation work, monitoring, reporting and evaluation.
44.       The AFC will be the lending channel for financing development of ranches
and feedlots. In order to strengthen AFC's financial position and to enable it to
build up reserves, IDA funds would be made available to it for 20 years including
5 years of grace at 3% annually. AFC would onlend to final beneficiaries at its -
current lending rates of 8% annually for 10 years including 3 years of grace.
These are consistent with prevailing terms for agricultural credit in Kenya (para-
graph 30). It is expeotred that with aaditional staff for its loan and
accounting departments to be financed under the proposed credit, AFC is expected
to be able to fulfill its role satisfactorily. Before each ranch investment plan
is submitted to AFC for final credit approval, the Project Coordination Unit would
evaluate it as to technical, economic and ecologf.cal suitability.
45.       The Ministry of Agriculture would have the main responsibility for pro-
Niding support services through its Livestock Marketing, Ranch Management and
.',ater Development Divisions and the Department of Veterinary Services. The Range
<anagement Division will work closely with the Ministry of Tourism in determining
;he stocking rates for all rangelands. The Kenya Meat Cormission (KMC) would
-ssist the Government in carrying out the study for determining the pattern for
expansion of the meat processing industry. It has been agreed that 1C4C will con-
tinue to obtain technical assistance under contract from an international meat
processing company. (Section 4.05(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
L16.      All the various entities concerned with the project are considered to
have adequate capabilities. However, the project will greatly expand their respons-
ibilities, and it is necessary that additional technical support be provided. The
proposed credit, as indeed the financing made available by the other donors, in-
cludes funds for technical personnel to improve and initiate training programs.
The Government has agreed with the Association on a staffing plan with detailed
job descriptions and proposed timing of recruitment for various supplementary posi-
tions in the various departments and agencies involved (Sechdule 4 to the draft
Development Credit Agreement)0 In addition, the Governient has agreed to consult
with the Association on personnel appointed to head the Project CoordiLat-ion Uni',
the various concerned divisions of the Ministry of Agriculture and the head of tuhe
Ranch Loan Section of AFC (Sections 3.01(b) and 4.06(a) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).

Procu-2ement
47.       Procurement of goods and services and letting of contracts financed
out of the proceeds of the credit and costing more than US$30,000 per contract
would be under Bank/IDA guidelines for international competitive bidding.  A
broad rEnge of items purchased under contract of less than US$30,000 would be
procured locally and, where appropriate, follow Government procurement procedures
which require competitive bidding and are acceptable to IDA. All construction
work required for the development of ranches and infrastructure facilities, which
would be scattered over a wide area, would be carried out by local contractors or
force account. All livestock required for the project would be purchased by the
individual ranching enterprises from the LMD or private suppliers. Procurement
for components (excluding Ranch Development) financed by Canada, the United King-
dom and the United States would be in accordance with their respective procurement
regulations.
Disbursements
)0B.      IDA would reimburse 50% of total expenditures for ranch development,
wildlife development, project administration costs, and 100% of foreign or 50% of
local expenditures for consultants and technical services. Because of the delays
in completing the financing arrangements for the project, work has already started
and up to $700,000 equivalent of retroactive financing to cover startup costs is
recommended. Before any funds are disbursed for wildlife development, the Govern-
ment has to satisfy the Association that agreement has been reached with cattle
owners to keep their cattle away from the wildlife reserve areas, and allow wild-
life to graze on their ranch land and that cattle owners will receive adequate
compensation for any reduction in income resulting from wildlife using their land.
(Section 4.06(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits
49.       At full maturity, expected to be in 1985, the incremental annual beef
production from the project is estimated to be about 23,000 m. tons representing a
50% increase over present marketed production. About 50% of the incremental pro-
duction would be attributable to project ranches and 50% to range water development
prcgrams and the regionalization of marketing and cattle movement. No difficulties
are expected in marketing the increased output of beef which has very favorable
demand prospects. Incremental annual export earnings due to the project are expected
to amount to $7 million. The overall economic rate of return for the project is
estimated at 25% at full development.
50.       In addition to increased and diversified exports, the project would
create some 5,000 new jobs in addition to engaging 10,000 families totalling
50,000 people on the ranches, whose incomes would increase from about $56 to
about $190 per annum. The water development schemes are expected to benefit
about 90,000 pastoralists increasing their incomes from $56 to $80 per annum
at full development.

51.         The Project is not without risks.  The potential for expand-
ing the livestock sector is great, but the problems of implementation which
may arise, owing to shortages of managerial and technical skills, will need
close attention. However, some lessons have been learned from our experience
with the first project. The staffing situation in the important agencies
and departments concerned is far superior to that which existed when we embarked
on the first project; a stronger and more workable coordinating machinery
has been devised, the legal and other issues facing group ranching have been
resolved.    FinallY the momentum, picked up by the first project after the
initial difficulties, gives us reason to be oonfident that this project can be
successfully carried out.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMETS AND AUTHORITY
52.         The draft Development Credit Agreement between Republic of

S,ummary of' Recent Economic Deyeloprents in Kenya 1/
Kenya has recently celebrated the end of the first decade of Inde-
cer=dence.  In looking back over the period, Kenya's achievements are notable.
Cn t--;in. p;er at the end of 1963, the Government inherited a difficult
nhai1enge.  While Kenya was already rather more developed than many newly
independent African nations, the dualistic nature of the economy which con-
centrated much of the wealth within the European and Asian communities, tended
to overshadow the underlying poverty of the mass of the African people. In
196?: the per capita income in Kenvy was around ;.30 or $85 a year. But the per
canita income of the African population was probably no more than $50 a year,
qnd poverty in the rural area, where 90 percent of the population lived, was
as serious in Kenya as in most African countries.
ln terms of overall growth, Kenya's economic performance since
Independence has been impressive in almost all respects. During the period
since 1964, GDP has grown at an average rate of about 7 percent in real terms,
.h'i cl! has allowed significant gains in per capita income despite the high
copulation growth rate.  Average per capita income in 1972 had risen to $170,
;hich is about the mediar for African countries. This growth rate has been
triggered by a high and growing rate of investment in both the private and
cublic sectors. In recent years, fixed capital formation has accounted for
over 25 percent of monetary GDP, which is an exceptionally high investment
rate. However, this has inevitably put a strain on Kenya's economic resource
base, and subsequently on the balance of payments, despite the fact that
Kenya's domestic savings rate (19-20%) is one of the highest in the develop-
ing world.
1The Governmentls fiscal and monetary management has been one of the
Lactors responsible for the generally sound performance of the economy. On
the fiscal side, the public sector's performance has been very good. In 1964,
Kenya had a recurrent budget deficit, a relatively insignificant development
budget and depended heavily on external aid. Since then, by virtue of its
increasing tax effort and disciplined control on spending, the Government has
(i) converted its recurrent deficit into a substantial surplus (which in
1970/71 accounted for 23 percent of all national savings), (ii) expanded its
dI&veiopment budget at an average rate of 27 percent a year, and (iii) consi-
lerabily reduced its relative dependence on external aid. The fact that Kenya
achieved these results with only negligible internal inflation and without
resorting to expensive forms of external financing makes this performance even
more notable.

While Kenya's performance in sustaining a fast rate of overall
-'ro;thl over the past ten years has been very good, some aspects of develop-
ment have been less satisfactory, and several important is8ues inevitably
emerge as Kenya prepares to embark upon the second decade of development. By
commion consensus the Government, the recent ILO/UNDP Report and the
Bank have all agreed that the most worrying aspect of Kenya's past performance
has been the failure to distribute the benefitba of development as widely as the
Government would like and, in particular, the growing unemployment and the con-
tinuing poverty. It is easy to criticize progress in distributing the benefits
of development, and always possible, in retrospect, to suggest a somewhat dif-
ferent set of policies. But no one pretends that there are any quick or easy
solutions to rural poverty, the growing pressure on the urban areas or the un-
employed school leavers. The fact thiat the Government requested the ILO to
undertake a major mission and that, after careful consideration, has accepted
the general strategy of the ILO's innovative report, is evidence of a commitment
to wider distribution.
In looking towards the ensuing decade, the Bank has concluded that
the first prerequisite for launching a more effective attack on unemployment
and rural poverty is to maintain or even increase the past rate of growth.
However, a number of indicators suggest that it may be more difficult for Kenya
to maintain the momentum achieved in the past without some significant adjust-
ments in the pattern of development and the style of management. Capital-
outpu-t ratios, while still reasonably low on the average, have been rising,
both household and public savings show some sign of levelling off, and the
increasing resource gap has put pressure on the balance of payments.
In several respects, therefore, Kenya may be at a turning point
in her development and will need to determine how the economy can be made to
perform more efficiently. In part the problem arises from the very success
of Kenya's past performance: for example, the domestic savings rate and tax
efforts have been so good that there may be little room for improvement. But
the position is also partly due to the fact that by the end of the first decade
Kenya had accomplished many of the more obvious and easy tasks, and that the
future planning and management of the economy must inevitably be more complex.
Thus, in agriculture, the impetus provided to the sector by the major programs
of land transfer and settlement is slackening, and future development will have
to give nore emphasis to the difficult task of increasing productivity and
employment among the smallholders, many of whom live on holdings which seem to
be too small or in marginal production areas. Similarly, in manufacturing,
the process of replacing imports, often at high cost, by encouraging foreign
investment, has reached the point of diminishing returns, and Kenya is having
to devise a whole new set of measures designed to make manufacturers competitive
in export markets and to foster small businesses in which African entrepreneurs
,-n develop and prosper.
7.         Thus, in looking to the future, the Bank has recommended a shift in
emphasis away from investment in infrastructure, a slower growth of expenditure
on social services and a larger allocation of resources to the directly pro-
ductive sectors.



P.nnex I

The major emphasis of -the recent economi.c renort was on agriculture and resource-
based manufacturing.  Agriculture and related manufacturing use resources more
"efficiently" in creatirg incomes and employrlient, in conserving scarce capital
and skilled manpower, in redistributing income, in generating foreign exchange and
perhaps even in stinulating savings than other sectors. Moreover; in the context
of Kenya, the nossible policy dilemma of havirng to "trade-off" growth against
emnloyment (and income distribution) does not seem to arise since both growth
and equity goals can be achieved th.rough restructuring the pattern of growth
in favor of the directly productive sectors. Rising import prices and the
increased cost of fuel is likely to entou-age greatEtr use of Kenya's most
valuable domestic resources -- land and labor.
8.         In manufacturing, it appears that while Kenya may well have a compa-
rative advantage in agriculture-based  processing, the protection given to
import substitution industries has not only encouraged the establishment of
some inefficient industries and discouraged exports by distorting input prices,
but has discriminated against agriculture.   Import incentives for efficient
resource allocation may result from the incipient moves towards uniform tariffs
and incentives for exports which the Kenyan authorities are already contemplating
in collaboration with the other two Partner States of the East African Commuritzt.
9.         But restructuring growth is not easy, in any country, and Kenya will
face a number of particular problems of her own. The first is to create the
appropriate environment of price and other incentives to induce the private
sector to develop rapidly and make better use of the resources available to it.
A second problem Kenya faces is the capacity of the public sector to accelerate
growth in the preferred sectors, particuilarly in agriculture. The problem is
of course, largely one of skilled manpower, and it is clear that Kenya's deve-
lopment potential will continue to be *urtailed by the scarcity of skills for
a long time. The recent basic economic report and the agricultural sector
survey have both emphasized the problem of low absorptiv.e capacity
in agriculture. For industry, the dearth of managerial skills adversely affects
small-scale business development and hinders efforts to screen new large-scale
industrial projects.  Much of the Bank's assistance to Kerya is aimed directly
or indirectly at helping to overcome these constraints.
10.        In adopting its new development plan, covering the period 1974-78,
the Kenya Government has already taken an important step towards initiating the
kind of economic reforms we have noted.   However, following the recent increases
in oil. nx-ices and the expected rise in the cost of other imports, the ambitious
targets of the plan may have to be reduced, and some adjustments will need to
be made to the investment program. Preliminary estimates made by the Bank
staff indicate that the net additional cost of oil to the Kenya economy ir.
1974 will be around $68 million, and that, taking into account the anticipated
cost. i.ncreases in other imports, Kenya may face a residual external financing
gnp of about $200 million in 1975. (This figure, which is larger than tho
estimate previously given to the Board, reflects revised prg jections fol Qw
ing the special economic mission referred to in   Part T; the 14hya
Government, in close cooperation with the Bank, has already started to draw
up an emergency program to deal with the new situation. The likely components
of thi L', progr;.ar are reinstitution of import controls and a curtailment of develop-
ment efforts in the short-tem, toegthor WI                    uwQtc8p r6truc_
turing tbo pattern of long-tOr growvt9   The initial re8ponse of G6vernment-hia7   -
been positive and realistic, and the new stringencies imposed on the economy by
the rapid deterioration in the terms of trade will probably accelerate some of the



Annex I
Page 7
necessary long-term economic reforms.  But, if the momentum achieved in develop-
ment is not to be too severely curtailed, the Kenyan economy will need additional
external capital during the next few years of adjustment. Much of this will have
to be on concessionary terms, and some non-project assistance will probably be
required towards the end of 1974 according to preliminary forecasts of the
balance of payments position. The particular problems facing Kenya in the short
term, together with wider developments over the 1974-78 Plan period, were dis-
cussed at the April 1974 meeting on Kenya of the Consultative Group for East
Africa, chaired by the Bank. The members of the Group accepted the severity of
Kenya's problems, and agreed to give careful consideration to the countries'
special needs.
11.           Kenya's outstanding external debt increased from $258 million at
the end of 1963 to $510 million at the end of 1972, of which $353 million had
been disbursed. Thus, since Independence, Kenya has accumulated external debts
at about 8% a year, or only slightly faster than the average rate of growth of
GDP. About 35% of total external debt is now held by the Bank Group (more or
less equally divided between IBRD and IDA), but because IBRD lending has only
recently become a significant proportion of Kenya's debt, delt service to the
Bank Group in 1973 was still less than 10% of all debt service payments; for
the same reason, the Bank Group's share is expected to rise in future. In
addition to its own external public debt, Kenya is also jointly responsible,
together with the other two Partner States , for the debts incurred by the
East African Community and its institutions, which amounted to some $216.0
million (outstanding including undisbursed) in September 1972. If a notional
one-third of the Community's total debt is allocated to each Partner State,
Kenya's debt service burden is increased by roughly a quarter, but still repre-
sents less than 6% of her foreign exchange earnings.
At the present tjie, Kenya's debt servLce burden is comparatively
ight, and @:reQltworthiness presents no obstacle to additional borrowing.
~.Owever, the recent increases in the cost of oil andi. other imports, on which
Ker^yv.'s future development depends, iaake it difficult to project the likely
evolution or the burden of debt or to assess Kenya's creditworthiness in the
su'ture. As indicated above, the new situation increases quite considerably
both tile immediate external financing problem and the motivation to adopt
long-term corrective measures. The ultim;te impact on Kenya's debt service
burde- ,ill therefore depend on the extent and terms on which the necessary
sxlditional financing can be obtained and the speed with which longer term
reforms can be instituted. The Bank staff will be giving priority to these
questions during the coming months.

C. Pro ects in Execution 1/
redit 129 - Livestock Dev$36 million Credit o' September
9.Sj 68' Closing Date:  December 31, 1 974t. .A Swedish Credit of the same
:mount has a]lso been made for this project.  Initial implementation was slow
in r:svt because of the project's pioneering r..ature, for which Kenya had littlle
= ner ence.  Progress on project execution has improved greatly during
tile past two years,and all furnds fo- ..nch- oevelopment have been committed.
The bulkl of the Credit has already been disbursed but to allow for retention
r.oney to be paid, the Closing Date h been postponed by one year until
i)ecember 31, 1974.
Loan 63? - Highways; $23.5 million Loan of October 10, 1969; Closing
Date:  June 30, 1975.  Construction is substantially completed except for two
contract.s- wvhich have been delayed by changes in specifications and construction
standards. These delays required postponement of the Closing Date from
recem1)er 31, 1973 to June 30, 1975. There has been a 30 percent increase above
original cost estimates due rirn.Aly to design changes.
Loan 641 - Forest Plantation; $2.6 million Loan of November 7, 1969;
iosnc :: >-:e: December 31, 1975. Progress is satisfactory and disburse:-
n.crn are oroceeding faster than envisaged, and the loan is expected to be fully
drxAwn doTm a year before Closing Date.  Plantisng and technical aspects are
satisfactory. Preparation of a second phase project is now well under way.
Credit 185 - Education; $6.1 million Credit of May 20, 1970; Closing
Sate: December 31, 1975.    Construction is proceeding at a slower rate than
anticipat.ed.  As remedial action has been taken, it is expected that all project
institutions except two will be completed prior to the December 197!i project
completion date; the remaining school for which the Government is proposing
modifications is expected to be completed about July 1975, six months prior to
the December 31, 1975 Closing Date.
Loan 714 - Water Supply; $8.3 million Loan of November 7, 1969;
f1osinrg Date: March 31, 1975. Good progress has been made on the main
ro1ect items, and water should be delivered to Nairobi on schedule in March
1,7,A. A twelve-month postponement of the Closing Date, however, will be
e-'qu2ired to enable comoletion of ancillary items. The Water and Sewerage
p. 'rtment is exueriencing serious staffing shortages in its engineering
:rAd comnercial sections due to inability to attract and retain staff. The
overnment and City Council have agreed on urgent remedial action.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and witth the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Credit 224 - Road Maintenance; 0i2.6 raillion Credit of December 28,
1)70: (losing Date: June 30, 1975. The Project is proceeding satisfactorily.
All designated posts in the MOW have been filled. Most of the equipment has
been installed and the Highway Training Center is operational.
Loan 745 - Kaxnburu Hydroelectric; $23.0 million Loan of June 7,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Project construction has slipped, and
completion is likely to be as much as six months behind the original scheduled
date of February 197L.  This should still permit beginning commercial opera-
tions by November 1974 -- the start of the rainy season. Costs have increased
by atbout 7 percent due principally to the last US dollar devaluation and
increased costs of consultants'services as the construction period lengthened.
Credit 276 - Highways; $22.0 million Credit of June 5, 1972; Closing
Date:  March 31  1976.  This project, which is jointly financed by a Swedish
Credit of :6.0 million, made a slow start due to delays in obtaining govern-
mental approvals to issue tenders.   Because of high bid prices, overall costs
of the project show a 10 percent increase.
Loan 326 - Nairobi Airport; $29 million Loan of June 2, 1972; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1976.   The major contracts have been awarded, and work has
comnenced, by ineadequate supervision by the key contractor and administrative
delays by the Gover:nient have led to delays in the physical execution of the
mroject.  The financial management, which was poor, has now improved, and a
Financial manager to help establish commercial accounting systems has been
-appointed.
Credit 34L - Agricultural Credit; $6.0 million Credit of November 29,
1972: Closing Date: June 30, 1976. This Credit was declared effective March
X, 1973. The Agricultural Finance Corporation has started a second phase of
lending operations, following the completion of the first under Credit 105.
Progress is proceeding well, except that on-farm credit supervision could be
improved.
Loan 932 - Highways; $29.0 million Loan of September 6, 1973; Closing
Da±te: December 31, 1977. This Loan was made effective on November 9, 1973.
Bids will be invited shortly.
Loan 946 - Industrial Develoment Bank; $5.0 million Loan of November
29, 1973; Closing Date:  March 31, 1970.   This loan became effective on March 26,
1974. A sub-project totalling $1.12 million has been approved, and further com-
mitments are expected in the near future.
Credit 168 - Population; $12.0 million Credit of April 1, 197L;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980. This Credit is not yet effective.

3.        Most of the Bank Group's direct lending to Kenya in the past has been
for infrastructure, particularly transportation and power, although other
sectors such as agriculture and forestry, education and water supply have also
received support. We intend in the future to give greater eilphasis to
a:igriculture and other directly productive sectors, particularly for projects
which are likely to bring more immediate benefits to large numbers of people
and will, as much as possible, increase Kenya's foreign exchange earnings.
Withr such objectives in mind, the Bank agreed with the Government on a program
for expanding the Bank's technical assistance in agriculture, beginning with
t`re agricultiral sector survey that was mounted in late 1972. We have
offerced an expanded program of assistance-in project identification through
the Regional Mission in Eastern Africa, and have provided a senior agricultu-
r.1 advisor to assist the Government in charting a longer-term strategy for
the agricultural sector.
4.        This expanwded -Vecbnical assistance is starting to show results.
A proposed IDA credit of $21.5 million, with complementary financing likely
from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, for a second livestock
project which covers a five-year beef development program calling for a total
investment of $52 million, has been negotiated and will soon be submitted for
consideration by the Executive Directors. Preparatory work is under way for
diversified smallholder production project for the drier areas of eastern
Kenya, an irrigation project in the Lower Tana River Basin, and for a project
to rehabilitate the currently underutilized large commercial farms in the
high potential areas. WThile these results of our joint efforts are encoura-
ging, they are only a beginning. To support adequately the development of
agriculture and the rural areap of Kenya will require sustained efforts.
The Government has now studied both the Agriculture Sector Survey and the
Basic Economic Report and largely agreEIs with their conclusions. The Bank
and the Government have discussed how best we can support accelerated
agricultural development during Kenya's 1974-78 Plan period. Apart from
assisting project preparation in agriculture, we foresee the need for
complementary development of rural infrastructure. We have therefore held
preliminary discussions on programs for development of rural water supply
and rural access roads.
5.        Concurrently with efforts to promote the development of the rural
economy, substantial investment will continue to be required to keep public
services abreast of economic growth. A Bank loan of $5.0 million to the Indus-
trial Development Bank was signed on November 29, 1973, and a $12.0 million IDAL
credit to assist Kenya's much-needed family planning program was signed on April
1, 1974. We also expect to continue financing key infrastructure pro4ects. A
$29.0 million loan to finance the construction of trunk, f6eder and other roacs
was signed on September 6, 1973. To provide a more efficient and economic means
of moving increasing volumes of petroleum products from M.ombasa to Nairobi, an
oil pipeline project is under preparation. A power project to keep pace with
Kenya's rapidly growing demands and a water supply project to alleviate water
shortages in I4ombasa are now being prepared. And as a first attempt to accomo-
date squatters in Nairobi with suitable housing, a sites and services project
with an upgrading component is expected to be appraised later this year.

's.       Although no projects are planned in the near future for the com on
services organizations of the East African Community, the Bank, through its
supervision missions of ongoing operationE, is discussing further assistance for
telecommunications, industry and port development. Additional loans to the East
African Railways Corporation, however, will have to await resolution of the
financial and operational problems being encountered by that Corporation. The
main operational problems consist of an inadequate tariff structure, inefficient
use of rolling stock, and differences between th(3 Partner States about how the
railways should be managed. The financial problems stem partly from these oper-
ational difficulties, 'but more directly from the recent failure of the regional
offices of the railways to remit funds to headquarters. As a consequence of
Lhis failure, debt service payments by the Corporation to the Bank under Loan
L23-EA are now overdue. The Bank has pressed the Corporation for payment and
has called upon the Partner States as Guarantors of the loan to make these pay-
ments if the Corporation is unable to do so.   Pending receipt of payment, dis-
bzrsements under Loan 67h-EA, the latest loan to the Railways, has been suspended.1/
7.        i addition to Bank and IA activities, IFC has investments totalling
s2L.1 million in three enterprises in KenyWa: $15.8 maillion in the Panafrican
Paper Miills, Ltd.; $5.9 million in Kenya Hotel Properties, Ltd.; and $2.2 million
Ln Tourism Promotion Services, Ltd. (Kenya).
1/  Payments due under Loan 42&EA were received on May 9, 1974.   Consequently
the right of the Railways to make withdrawals from the Loan Account for
Loan 674-EA has been restored.
