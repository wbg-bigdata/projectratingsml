APPRALISAL OF A HIG15JAY P?OJECT
SUn :{YIA
i.        In early 1966, the Government of the Republic of Ivory Coast
requested Bank assistance in financing a highway project. The project
comprises; (i) the reconstruction and paving of the Abengourou-Agnibilekrou
road, about 60 km in length; (ii) the supervision by consultants of con-
struction of this road; (iii) feasibility studies of about 700 km of primary
roads; and (iv) detailed engineering of about 500 km of these roads, identi-
fied by the feasibility studies to be of the highest economic priority.
ii.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated
at about US$7.9 million equivalent. It is based on detailed engineering and
prices in recent bids for similar wiorks. The foreign exchange comnonent of cost
is estimated at about 70 zercent, or US$5.8 million equivalent, and will be
financed by the proposed loan. Local currency requirements will be met from
the annual budget of the Ivory Coast.
iii.      Resonsibility for road construction and maintenance rests with the
Directorate of Public WIorks (PWD) of the Ministry of Public Works and Trans-
port. The construction contract will be awarded on the basis of in-ternational
com-petitive bidding. Final survey and design has been carried out by the
semi-public consulting firm of Bureau National d'Etudes Techniques de Develop-
ment (B.N.E.T.D.) of the Ivory Coast.   Consultants acceptable to the Bank
will carry out the suDervision of the project road. The proposed feasibility
studies and subsequent detailed engineering will also be carried out by con-
sultants acceptable to the Bank.
iv.       The Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road, which will improve an important
link in the Ivory Coast's road network, has a high priority in the country's
road development program. Its reconstruction and paving is economically
justified by savings in transportation costs. Direct benefits to road users
and savings in road maintenance are estimated to yield an economic return of
around 10 percent which is satisfactory. In addition, the project will un-
doubtedly stimulate exchanges between regions thereby accelerating complete
integration of the country.
v.        In July 1967, the Government applied to the UNDP for assistance in
financing the foreign exchange element of a two-phase overall transport sur-
vey covering a period of two years. A favorable decision on Phase I has
been taken; the Bank will act as executing agency.   A decision on Phase II of
the survey will be made on completion of Phase I.   This survey will assist in
the improvement of existing transport services in the Ivory Coast, formulate a
basis for the coordinated development of all forms of transports, and
complete preinvestment studies for selected highway projects.
vi.       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Govern-
ment of US$5.8 million equivalent. A 19-year term, including a 3 1/2-year
period of grace, is appropriate on project grounds.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of the Republic of Ivory Coast in May 1966 requested
Bank assistance in financing part of its highway program. A suitable pro -
ject comprises: (i) reconstruction and paving of the Abengourou-Agnibilekrou
road; (ii) supervision of construction of this road; (iii) preinvestment
studies including (a) feasibility studies for about 700 km of primary roads
and (b) detailed engineering of about 500 km of these roads identified by the
feasibility studies as being of the highest economic priority.
1.2       In 1954 the Bank made a loan (No.100-FR) of US$7.5 million equi-
valent to the Office Central des Chemins de Fer de la France d'Outre-Mer for
completion of the conversion from steam to diesel traction of the rakar-Niger
and Abidjan-Niger Railways. The entire loan amount was for the acquisition
of diesel locomotives, and has been repaid.
1.3       The proposed loan will be the first lending operation for highways
by the Bank or IDA in the Ivory Coast.
1.4       The Bankrs Abidjan Office assisted in the identification of the
project. It was appraised by a Bank mission which visited the Ivory Coast
in April/May 1967.  This report is based on economic and engineering studies
carried out by the Bureau National d'Etudes Techniques de Developpement
(B.N.E.T.D.) and the findings of the Bank appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. Ludwig, Brandreth, and Siret, with the assistance of Er. Duncan from
the Bank's Permanent Mission in West Africa. Additional information was
secured by missions which visited the Ivory Coast in September and November,
1967.
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.1       The Ivory Coast is roughly square in shape and has a total land
area of 322,000 lea' which is about the size of the British Isles. It is
bounded by the Gulf of Guinea on the south, Liberia and Guinea on the west,
Mali and Upper Volta on the north, and Ghana on the east.
2.2       The topography of the country is mostly flat, though with gently
rolling terrain in some areas. Climate and vegetation vary markedly accord-
ing to latitude, with dense tropical forest in the southern region, open
forests and grassland in the central region and savannas in the north.
In the southern region the climate is hot and humid with annual rainfall
between 1,250 and 1,750 mm while in the northern half there is a seven-months
dry season and low rainfall.



- 2 -
2.3       The population, estimated at 4.3 million, is predominantly rural
and includes 360,000 farm laborers from nearby countries and 30,000 non-
Africans. It is growing at a rate between 3 and 3.5 percent per annum, of
which 1 percent is due to immigration, mostly from Upper Volta.
2.4       The economy of the Ivory Caast is based on agriculture and forestry,
which together employ over 80 percent of the population of working age.
Coffee, timber, cocoa, and bananas produced in the southern and central region
are the principal products. While manufacturing and construction activities
have grown rapidly over the past ten years, they remain of minor importance.
2.5       The gross domestic product was estimated in 1966 at CFAF 260
billion (about US$1 billion equivalent). The per capita GDP is relatively
high at about US$230, but is subject to great regional variations, ranging
from US$81 in the under-developed north to US$202 in the south and to
US$1,100 in Abidjan itself. Political stability and a vigorous program of
export promotion led to the impressive average growth rate of 9 percent per
annum in GDP in the period 1956-1966.  World surpluses of coffee and cocoa,
and a consequent drop in prices in 1965, have recently slowed the pace of
development. This levelling off of exports had been expected for some time
and a program of agricultural diversification, with emphasis on oil palm
and pineapples, was launched in 1962. Improvements resulting from this
program are only likely to begin to be realized in the early 1970's.
Development Program
2.6       Upon independence, the Ivory Coast drew up a ten year plan for the
period 1960-1970. This plan was never formally adopted by the Government
but served as a guide for the preparation of draft annual investment budgets.
Most public investment targets included in the plan now appear too ambitious
to be reached within the remaining 3 year period and the Government has
drafted a modified intermediate plan for 1967-1970 leading to the preparation
of a new comprehensive 5 year plan covering the years 1971-1975.
2.7       Investment decisions within the plan have, up to now, been taken
on a pragmatic basis rather than as a result of thorough sector and project
analysis. Planning in the transport sector for the next plan period will be
substantially improved through a two-phase transport survey. The Government
applied in July 1967 to the UNDP to finance the foreign exchange element
of this study. A favorable decision on Phase I was taken late in January
1968; the Bank will act as executing agency. A decision on Phase II will be
made on completion of Phase I. The purpose of the survey is to assist in
the improvement of existing transport services in the Ivory Coast9 to
formulate a basis for the coordinated development of all forms of transport,
to draw up a program of investments for the period of 1971 to 1975 and
guidelines for the period from 1976 to 1986 and to complete preinvestment
studies for selected highway projects.



-3-
B. The Transport Sector
a. General
2.8       The predominant feature of the country's transport infrastructure
is an extensive road network serving every important part of the country,
except the extreme south-western region. There is a well-developed road
transport industry which carries about 70% of all traffic. Railway services
consist of a single meter--gauge line running northward from Abidjan to the
Upper Volta capital of Ouagadougou. Inland water transport is limited to
shallow coastal lagoons and two short navigable river stretches.
2.9       The topographical features of the country present no major problems
for transport development, although north-south construction paralleling the
flow of the water-courses is easier and less costly than east-west development.
Industry and population are centred in the south-east and central areas of the
country where abundant rainfall facilities, agricultural activities and
heavily forested areas abound. Highway development reflects this concentration
of population and economic activity. The transport system generally provides
adequate nation-wide coverage but higher road design standards will be needed
in the future to meet growing traffic requirements.
b. Highways
2.10      There are 33,000 km of public roads in the Ivory Coast, generally
well-balanced between primary and secondary roads. Only about 3% of the road
system is bituminized; these sections carry approximately 50r of the total
road traffic. The remainder of the network consists of laterite and earth
roads. The former are maintained to a high standard even in areas of torren-
tial rain. While the primary and secondary road systems are well-developed,
there is a shortage of feeder roads and no comprehensive plan for adequate
development although the ministries of both Agriculture and Transportation are
involved in construction and maintenance of these roads. This problem will be
studied in the Transport Survey.
c. Railways
2.11      The only railway in the Ivory Coast (Regie du Chemin de Fer Abidjan-
Niger, RAN) follows a north-south alignment, from the port of Abidjan to the
Upper Volta border (about 625 km) and from there for another 512 km to Oua-
gadougou, the capital of Upper Volta.  The railway is jointly owned by the two
Governments and is run by a semi-autonomous company. A rehabilitation program
of the meter-gauge track was started in 1962, financed 60% by the two govern-
ments and 40% by the company itself.  The European Investment Bank has recently
agreed to finance the reconstruction of about 60 km of track with a loan of
about US$6 million equivalent. This work should be underway in the near future.
Dieselization is complete and the rolling stock is comparatively new. Freight
traffic, in addition to Upper Volta goods (23% of 1966 total traffic), also
includes some MIali traffic (14% of 1966 total traffic). Since 1961 it has
remained constant at about 340 million ton-km reflecting the growing austerity
measures in Upper Volta which have reduced imports and a return of most Mali



- 4 -
traffic to the route through Daksr.  in 1965, rai lway freight traffic
represented about 24 percent of the national total.   Imports, mainly food-
stuff, building materials and oil products, dominate the railway's traffic
making up nearly two-thirds of the total movements. Passenger traffic grew
steadily from 1957 to 1965 at about 17 percent per annum reaching 500 million
pass-km in the latter year.
2.12      While the railway continues to show a financial surplus and has
been able to make a sizeable contribution towards cagital improvements in
recent years, its profitability has been deteriorating. Squeezed by rising
costs, lack of freight traffic growth and pressure on rates from road com-
petition, net revenues before depreciation (reDresented by arbitrary con-
tributions to a renewal fund) fell from the equivalent o° US$4.5 million in
1962 to US$3.5 million in 1965 and US$2.5 million in 1966.   While balance
sheet data are not provided in such a form as to make accurate calculations
possible, it appears improbable that the railway earns a reasonable rate of
return on its investment. The railway will be subject to detailed study
under the transport survey.
d. Waterways
2.13      The inland waterways system is 500 km in length, about two-thirds
of which is shallow lagoons and canals, the remainder being made up of navi-
gable sections of the Bandama and Comoe rivers. The main commodities trans-
ported are manganese ore, logs and foodstuffs. Water transport handles about
5 percent of the total goods traffic.
e. Airways
2.14      Internal air servic es are provided by a national company, Air
Ivoire. International servi es, including servi es to Europe, are operated
by Air Afrique which is ow.med jointly by 12 member countries of the Organi-
sation Commune Africaine et Malgache (O.C.A.M.), as well as by U.T.A. (Union
de Trans;iorts Aeriens), Swissair and Pan American Airways.  Local air trans-
port still represents a negligible proportion of total traffic.
f. Ports
2.15      The Ivory Coast has only one dee,-water port, Abidjan, which
currently handles 99 percent of imports and almost 90 percent of exports.
Total tonnage handled has increased at a rate of about 15 percent per annum
from 1 million tons in 1956 to 4.1 million tons in 1966.
2.16      To relieve the growing pressure on the port of Abidjan, iDarticularly
for logs and timber exports, and to open the undeveloped south-western portion
of the country, the Government has recently decided to build a new port at San
Pedro. This port, to be devoted largely to timber traffic in the first in-
stance, will also reduce overland transport costs to and from the western sec-
tion of the country.  The initial investment, providing for two berths, has
been estimated in 1967 at about US$21.2 million, US$9.6 million for the port
itself and US$11.6 for housing and access roads. This work is being financed by



a mixture of contractors' and suppliers' credits with Government guarantees
and long term loans.  The present progran calls .ior the first phase of develop-
ment to be comnleted in 1971.
C. Transport Coordination
2.17      While road transport is the predominant form of transport in the coun-
try as a whole, road-rail competition exists along the north-south rail
route which serves the major centers of population. At present, road freight
services operating parallel to the railway are legally restricted to the
use of vehicles with a load limit of six tons or less. In practice, however,
this law is not enforced and road-rail competition is intense.
2.18      There are no controls on road transport rates and fares.   On the
other hand, railway charges are subject to government approval. The railway
rates on goods moving between Upper Volta and Abidjan contain elements of
cross-subsidization, designed to reduce costs on certain items at the expense
of others. Until recently, the Government directly subsidized long-haul
freight movements, a policy established before independence. This practice
has now been discontinued but no compensatory rate increases have been
permitted.
2.19      A National Committee for Transport was established in November
1966 which, with technical committees in each region, is responsible for
road transport policies and the regulation of road-rail competition. The
establishment of this Committee arose from allegations that as a result of the
existing policy of granting road service permits freely, an oversupply of road
transport services had lead to intense competition and uneconomic trucking
rates and bus fares. Railway complaints concerning road competition were
another factor leading to its formation.  The Committee has broad powers
governing the issuance of road service licenses, the schedules of trucking
and bus service to be provided and the rates and fares to be charged. Its
primary functions will be the balancing of road service demand and supply and
consideration of the problems of road-rail competition. There is no evidence
as yet of the establishment of proper economic guidelines for the accomplish-
ment of these objectives, however, and the Committee has not been functioning
sufficiently long to provide clear indications as to its probable long-term
approach to these problems.   As an interim measure, the Committee has
stopped the issuance of freight transport permits to truckers pending investi-
gation of the relationship between supply and demand.
2.20      The foregoing matters will be subject to thorough review in the
course of the Transport Survey. There are no transport coordination or
competition problems directly associated with the road to be reconstructed
and the roads to be studied under the project.

3. TME HIGHWAY S&CTOR
A, Highway Network
3.1       The present highway network is classified in three categories
which distinguish roads of national (primary), regional (secondary) or
local (tertiary or feeder) significance (see Table 1). The length of the
road network has doubled over the past 10 years as indicated in Table 2. The
Ivory Coast has one of the densest road networks in West Africa as shown by
the following comparison with some other countries:
Km Roads       Km Roads per 1,000
per Km2            Inhabitants
Guinea                      0.10                  6.8
Sierra Leone                0.07                  2.7
Liberia                     0.03                  3.2
Ivory Coast                 0.10                  8.0
France                      1.10                14.2
B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.2       In 1965, there were about 57,000 vehicles (excluding motorcycles)
in the Ivory Coast and an estimated 63,000 in 1966. About 55% of these were
automobiles (including taxis and small buses), 35% trucks, and 10lo tractor
trailers and large buses. Between 1960 and 1965, the average growth rate
of the total vehicle fleet has been about 17%) per annum with heavy vehicles
increasing about 13% yearly. Two-thirds of the vehicles are registered in
the southern region, centered on Abidjan, reflecting the distribution of
population and industry in the country.
3.3       The vehicle fleet is modern, with 70% of the vehicles being 5
years old or less. Private vehicles, vans, and trucks are currently assembled
in the Ivory Coast at a rate of about 2,000 vehicles per year, and no
restrictions are imposed on the number of vehicles imported. Truck axle-
loading was formerly limited to 13 tomsbut within the past two years it has
been reduced to 10 tonsfor the purpose of reducing road damage.
3.4       Gasoline consumption for road transport rose at a rate of 6% per
annum over the decade 1955-1965. Diesel fuel consumption increased more
rapidly at about 18% per annum, reflecting a shift from gasoline to diesel
engines in trucks and large buses.
3.5       Traffic counts are conducted semi-annually throughout the country
by the Roads Department. They are generally considered unreliable, provid-
ing only orders of magnitude. They indicate, however, that overall traffic
has been growing at about 7-8% per annum. In the course of the Transport
Survey, the consultants will assist the Qovernment to establish reliable
traffic counting procedures so as to determine yearly and seasonal variations
as well as national trends. Assurancehave been received from the Government



- 7 -
that procedures satisfactory to the Bank will be established and followed
to ensure the development of adequate traf-fic statistics for future road
planning,
3.6       Government receipts from road users, which amounted to about US$36
million equivalent in 1966, substantially exceeded road construction, mainte-
nance and administration costs, which amounted to less than US$17 million
equivalent in the same year. Road transport, therefore, appears to be con-
tributing substantially more to recurrent government revenues than is returned
through recurrent road expenditures. This affects the competitive position
of road transport vis a vis the railway,
3.7       Road transport is well developed with over 30,000 commercial
vehicles handling about 70% and 75% of freight and passenger movements
respectively in the country.  The trucking industry is well organized, effi-
ciently operated and highly competitive and consists largely of small owner-
operated firms. Organized bus operations, using large vehicles, are limited
to Abidjan and a few other major centers. Inter-city passenger services are
provided essentially by mini-buses (6-20 seats) and taxis.
3.8       From a recent survey (March 1967) the total capacity of vehicles
registered for public freight transport service was estimated at about
12,000 tons. It appears that there is substantial excess capacity, resulting
in intense competition between carriers and rather low rates. Truckers
complain that these rates do not allow them to amortize their vehicle and
most of them claim to be operating at a loss. The industry has asked that
the axle loading limits be raised from 10 to 13 tor and that rates be fixed.
These complaints and proposals, together with the question of road user
charges, in relation to the economic costs of the road system, will be
considered by the Transport Survey.
C. Highway Administration
3,9       The Public Works Directorate (Direction des Travaux Publics) is
responsible for the construction and maintenance of the classified road
network (Table 1). Its organization is given in Chart 1. In addition,
there are penetration and timber haul roads which are not under the juris-
diction of the Directorate.  These are built and maintained by forest con-
cessionaires within their concession areas.
3.10      The PoW.D., which was formerly staffed mainly by French administrators,
is being Africanized. An Ivorian engineer was recently made the Director
General of the PWD, and two other Ivorian engineers are the heads of the Sub-
Directorate of Roads and the Directorate of Equipment. At present, there are
sufficient trained personnel (about one-quarter being expatriates) to manage
the RPN efficiently at its current level of activities and responsibilities.
For administrative purposes, the PWD has established six divisions, correspond--
ing to the political divisions of the country, with headquarters in the
regional capitals. In each of these regional divisions there are in turn two
to five sub-divisions each of which covers several local units. In the course
of the Transport Survey, a general study of the internal organization of the



- 8 -
PnD will be made, in the light of the proposed highway program, with a view
to suggesting improvements.
3.11      The RID has for many years laid strong emphasis on training;
several programs, aimed at various specialities, are operated on a regular
basis. The output of these training programs has been generally sufficient
to meet the needs. Since 1961 higher education in public works is available
at the National College of Public Works in Abidjan.
D. Highway Financing and Planning
3.12      Funds for road construction have been secured from several sources:
budget, foreign aid, and suppliers' credits. The average annual expenditures
over the five-year period from 1961 through 1966 have been steady at about
US$9.0 million equivalent, of which about 75%/f has been financed by suppliers'
credits and contractor financing. Aid from FED and FAC has been a major
source of funds for road construction in the past, but has dwindled in recent
years.
3.13      The road maintenance operations of the PWD are financed from two
sources: a) a budget allocation for the maintenance of feeder roads or tracks,
which is relatively constant; and b) the Road Maintenance Fund,into which an
earmarked motor fuel tax is channeled. Since the re-establishment of the
fund the resources available for maintenance are as follows:
(Million in US$ Equiv.)
1966        1967     1968
(Forecast)
Fund                        h.5       5.0       5.5
Budget allocation           l.h       1.4       1.5
-.9        6.        7.0
3.14      The above allocation for road maintenance is reasonable; total
funds available are expected to increase by US$0.5 million equivalent annually.
The preparation of a program for maintenance is included in the terms of
reference of the forthcoming Transport Survey.
3.15      The present Three-year Plan 1967-70, foresees priority capital
investments for roads of about US$12 million equivalent per year. The priority
list in this plan contains about 1,000 km of roads designated for construction
or improvement. The construction works in the project are included in this
priority program0
E. Highway Engineering
3.16      The designs of new highways are up-to-date and adequate. These
standards are summarized in Table 3.
3.17      In 1964 the Government formed a semi-public consulting firm known
as the National Office for Technical Development Studies (Bureau National



- 9 -
d'Etudes Techniques de Developpement - B.N.E.T.D.) which is entrusted with
all engineering works for proJects financed '-, the Government or with foreign
aid. B.N.E.T.D. has financial autonomy, is run on businesslike lines and
does not depend on the Government's budget. The firm is under the general
jurisdiction of the Minister of Planning and has been given a monopoly for
all government-iinanced consulting works.  The Bureau may either carry out
the work itself or sub-contract it to specialized independent consulting
engineers.  The B.N.E.T.D. is staffed mainly with Frenchmnen.  Work carried
out so far has been confined largely to government buildings. The capacity
of the organization'3 road sub-section is limited and it cannot presently
undertake a substantial volume of highway engineering with its ol,m forces.
The B.N.E.T.D. does not have the capacity to carry out the feasibility
studies and detailed engineering included in the project.
3.18      The PWD is also assisted in the design of highways and the super-
vision of construction by a national soils and materials testing laboratory.
Since 1955, the laboratory has been efficiently managed and operated by a
Paris-based laboratory under contract to the PWD. A field laboratory is set
up for routine quality control of materials on all major road construction
works.
F. Highway Construction
3.19      The PID does not  as a matter of policy   undertake departmental con-
struction for roads other than seasonal tracks an3 feeder roads. All new
construction work for main roads is undertaken by unit price contracts,
usually after public bidding. The PUD is weak in planning and design;
in the past detailed designs have been carried out by consultants and con-
tractors. Plans and specifications show the nature of the work in sufficient
details to peridt a contractor to submit an accurate bid.
3.20      Several large foreign contracting firms have set up local branches
in the country, and through supplier's credits have maintained a steady volume
of business. These contractors are of French or Italian origin. There are
no obstacles to the entry of foreign concerns.
G. I'laintenance
3.21      Road maintenance is carried out by the HWD with its own forces,
except for occasional bituminous pavement patching and sealing works which
are awarded to contractors. Maintenance work is performed in a regular
and worlkanlike manner and the level of maintenance is, on the whole, superior
to that in other countries of the region. Mlaintenance work done by mechanical
equipment is costed in some detail, but hand labor costs are less systemati-
cally analysed. Nonetheless, the cost accounting procedure makes it possible
to allocate costs in a general way among the different classes of road.

4. TEr PROJECT
A. General
4.1       The project consists of the following (see map):
i)  The reconstruction and the paving of the 60 km
Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road;
ii) The supervision of construction of the road under
i) above;
iii) Preinvestment studies
a)  Feasibility studies of about 700 km of primary
roads;
b)  The detailed engineering of about 500 km of road
sections identified as of high priority from the
feasibility studies in a) above.
i) Abengourou-Agnibilekrou Road
4.2       The Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road is a section of the Abidjan--
Adzope-Abengourou-Bouna road which is the backbone of the road network in the
eastern region. It forms the main link to Ghana and connects the north-
eastern zones of the country wJith the main port of Abidjan.  The project
includes the construction of a short by-pass at Abengourou and two shortcuts,
thereby reducing the present alignment from 69 km to 60 km. The alignment
follows the existing route for about 40 km and acquisition of the remaining
20 km of right-of-way is underway, and no problems are envisaged.
4.3       The present two-lane road, running through gently rolling terrain,
is badly aligned in part and has curves of 80 to 100 m radius. The road is
an old track improved by a laterite surfacing; it hugs the terrain and steep
grades are common. Bridges are bottlenecks as they are generally only
5 m wide. The proposed design standards are shown in Table 3 for a Class "A"
road. The carriageway will consist of a laterite sub-base and a cement-
stabilized laterite base, with a 6.5 m wide wearing course in asphaltic con-
crete. The detailed engineering is satisfactory and has been carried out by
B.N.E.T.D.
ii) Supervision of Construction
4.4       The project provides for the supervision of construction of the
Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road by consulting engineers. While the PWD has
experience in supervising work of this size it does not presently have the
capacity, and the Government has agreed to have the supervision carried out
by consultants acceptable to the Bank.



iii) Preinvestrment Studies
4.5       The first results of the Transport Survey will be available in 1969.
They will serve as a basis for an overall road investment program for the
country covering the years 1971-1975. However, detailed engineering for the
roads included in this investment program would not be available before the
end of 1971 at the earliest. In order to bridge the gap between the proposed
project and future investments, the Government has asked that provisions be
made in the loan for an intermediate program of preinvestment studies for high
priority road construction.
a) Feasibility Studies
4.6       For the aforementioned program a number of roads totalling about
700 km have been selected for feasibility studies, in agreement with the
Government. These studies will include the preliminary engineering and
economic evaluations of these roads, taking into consideration present and
expected traffic, the agricultural and industrial potential of the areas
concerned and the present condition of the highways.
The following high priority roads have been identified:
1. Man-Duekoue-Issia                     194 km
2. Toumodi-Dimbokro-Bongouanou           120 km
3.  Asouakro-Ouelle                       41 km
49  Abidjan-Akoupe-Abengourou            207 km
5.  Azaguie-Agboville-Akoupe             115 km
6.  Agboville-Akapou                      30 km
Total      707 km
Roads Nos. 2 and 3 should be considered as a unit with the Bongouanou-Asouakro
section, which was recently completed, because they traverse the so-called
"Boucle du cacao", an area where most of the country's cocoa is grown.   The
studies for roads Nos. 4 to 6 above will make recommendations regarding the
general alignment of the major artery from Abidjan to Akoupe with access
roads to the main towns and centers in this area.  They will also make re-
commendations on the access route from this highway into Abidjan in relation
to the main east-west Bingerville-Dabou axis.
b) Detailed Engineering
4.7       The rest of the project provides for the detailed engineering of
about 500 km of roads selected from the feasibility studies mentioned under
a) above. Since the roads covered by feasibility studies are all high
priority roads, it can be expected that a program of about 500 km of roads,
economically justified, will result.  The final list of roads for detailed
engineering -ill be made by the Government in agreement with the Bank.
This wias confirmed during negotiations.

B4 Cost Estimate and Foreign Component

down into local and foreign costs.

2.100    800       7.900
4.9       The cost estimate for road construction is based upon detailed
engineering by consultants. The contingencies include allowances of 10
percent for changes in physical quantities and 6 percent for price escala-
tion, to safeguard against possible increases in construction or engineer-
ing costs over the two year period of construction. The cost of road con-
struction is relatively high, first because prices are generally high in
the country, and secondly because the system of contractor financing has
led to unduly high prices. International competitive bidding is expected
to prevent the latter situation from arising in the case of this project.
The cost estimate for the preinvestment studies include a contingency allowance
of 15 percent for any possible increases in the scope of the work.
4.10      On the basis of an analysis by the P'D, the Bank estimates the
foreign exchange component at 70 percent for construction and 80 percent for
consultant services, supervision and preinvestment studies, or an average of
73 percent for the overall project. These estimates are in line with those
encountered in neighboring and similar countries. Except for labor (mostly
semi-skilled, or unskilled), aggregates, water, transportation, communications,
and housing, which are mainly of local origin, all significant costs are
associated with goods and services of foreign origin, such as equipment, fuel,
steel, bitumen, and management.  There is a local cement factory, but since it
operates with imported clinker, the foreign component of its product is high.
C. Project Execution and Financing
4.11      The present procedures used by the PWD to award contracts comply
in general with the Bank's guidelines for international competitive bidding.
The PWD has agreed to prequalify bidders to ensure that contractors permitted
to bid have the technical and financial capability to carry out the project
works. The PWD has also agreed to open the bids in public.



- 13 -
4.12      It is expected that construction of the road, under a single
contract, will commence in the second half of 1965, after allowing for a
reasonable period for prequalification and bidding. The construction
period will be two years, ample time for the size of the contract. Con-
struction, therefore should be completed at the end of 1970. It is ex-
pected that the feasibility studies will be started mid-1968 and detailed
engineering will be completed in the second half of 1969. As the PWD does
not do large scale engineering and B.N.E.T.D.'s staff is limited, con-
sultant services will be required to carry out the feasibility studies and
detailed engineering. Consultants acceptable to the Bank will be engaged
by the Government.
4.13      With a two year construction period and on the assumption that
loan signature will be mid-1968, annual foreign currency disbursements are
expected to be as follows:
1968     1969    1970    Total
Amount in million ofUS$      0.7      3.3     1.8     5.8
4.14      The Government has undertaken to make the local funds avail-
able.
4.15      Disbursement will be made on the basis of (i) the actual
foreign costs of the consultants' services and (ii) 70 percent of ex-
penditures on the construction contract. Any savings in the funds pro-
vided by the loan would be cancelled.
5. ECOINOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Introduction
5.1       The impressive de-velopment in agriculture and industry in the
southeastern region of the Ivory Coast over the last few years has not
been matched in the remainder of the country. Some correction of the
resulting imbalance between the various regions is now a major objective
of Government policy. The reconstruction and improvement of the project
road will represent a major element in the development of the middle
eastern part of the country by easing communications with its complementary
area in the southeast.
B. Abengourou-Agnibilekrou Road (60 km)
5.2       The project road is part of the main artery which extends 260 km
from Abidjan through Adzope, Akoupe, Abengourou, Agnibilekrou and further
north to the Ghana border. This route links the central and northeastern
regions of the country, zones of large agricultural production, with the
commercial and administrative center of Abidjan. It serves an area covering
about one-fifth of the whole country.



- 14 -
5.3       The project road is the only outlet for the Agnibilekrou-Bondoukou
region which contains about 30,000 inhabitants spread over an area of about
9,000 km2. Marketed agricultural production in this region, including coffee,
cocoa, bananas and local foodstuffs, amounted roughly to 120,000 tons in 1966
with timber exports, shipped directly by road to the port of Abidjan, total-
ing about 100,000 tons.
5.4       Traffic statistics prior to 1966 are fragmentary and unreliable
for planning purposes and no accurate traffic trends can be derived from
these statistics. Traffic counts on various sections of the porject road
in 1966-67 show an average daily traffic ranging between 260 and 290
vehicles.  The proporiton of trucks is about 35 percent, about half of
which are heavy semi-trailer logging trucks.
5.5       Because the area served by the project road is entering a transition
stage, with economic development shifting from logging to diversified agri-
cultural production, traffic growth has not been as great as in other areas.
Lumbering activities are expected to decline from a level of 100,000 tons
per year to 50,000 tons per year in the 1970-75 period. While agricultural
production of export products such as coffee, cocoa, as well as of products
for internal consumption will not, in the short run, be sufficient to com-
pensate for this tonnage loss, growing output will be of a type requiring
faster, more frequent service and the handling of smaller individual volumes.
Thus the total number of vehicle movements carrying goods should register
small initial gains, gradually increasing as agricultural production grows.
At the same time, the shift to agricultural production should place greater
purchasing power into the hands of large numbers of the population living
within the service area of the project, thus creating increased demand for
imported products and travel facilities.
5.6       There are no reliable background data on economic growth within
the project region. On the basis of estimates of production growth prepared
by Government consultants, due account being taken of the likely shift in
production, goods traffic is expected to grow at about 3-4 percent in the
early years following the opening of the road, with growth later increasing
to about 5 percent per annum. At the same time, passenger vehicle traffic
growth (including small buses and cars) is expected to average about 7 percent
per annum throughout the period. These forecasts appear reasonable.
5.7       On the basis of estimates made by B.N.E.T.D. and discussions with
road transport operators, the Bank has estimated vehicle operating costs
with and without road improvements (Table 5). These estimates take into
consideration differences in gradients, curves and surface conditions of
the project road as compared with the existing road. The savings resulting
from these higher standards as well as a 9 km reduction in distance account
for nearly 90 percent of the calculated benefits. The remainder stem from
savings in road maintenance costs which would increase over time with traffic
growth. Assuming a probable range in the estimates of present traffic and
future traffic growth an effort has been made to test the sensitivity of the
economic rate of return on the investment to variations of these elements.
The analysis showed that the economic return will range between 9.5 and 12
percent (see Annex). This is considered satisfactory for projects of this
nature.



- 15 -
5.8       Additional benefits, not readily quantifiable, will result from
the reconstruction. of the project road.  The lack of racial and linguistic
uniformity in the Ivory Coast makes colmmumications and exchanges between
regions of vital importance for political unity. Moreover, the project road
is part of the only existing route to Ghana and its improvement will facilitate
exchanges between the two countries thereby allowing closer cooperation.
C. Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
5.9       The project provides for 700 km of road feasibility studies and
for the detailed engineering of about 500 km which, it is anticipated, the
studies will prove to be justified. These would form the basis of a future
project suitable for external assistance. Such a project would ensure
continuity in the Ivory Coastts road development program as well as fill the
gap between the present project and those which would arise out of the overall
transport survey. The 700 km covers roads of important economic significance
as discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.
5.10      The Man-Issia road section passing through Duekoue and rGuessabo is
the most westerly portion of the main east-west highway linking the rich
agricultural and forestry area of the west with the port of Abidjan. Since
the western area is the most productive forestry region of the country,
logging traffic is heavy over the Man-Abidjan link. It amounted to 155,000
tons in 1966, of which about two-thirds originated in the area served by the
MIan-Issia road section. IMiuch of this traffic would eventually be subject to
diversion from Abidjan to the new port San Pedro, thus reducing the overland
transport haul. However, this diverted traffic would continue to flow over
the Man-Issia segment, connecting at Issia with the project road to San Pedro.
The shorter road haul may be expected to spur development in the western area,
leading to accelerated traffic growth.
5.11      The Abidjan-Akoupe-Abengourou road is part of the major artery
leading to the north-east. Its alignment is poor and much reconstruction will
be necessary to enable it to carry any substanital increase in traffic. The
section between Abidjan and Akoupe passes near highly productive agricultural
areas (mainly coffee and bananas) which require improved road transport to
realize their full potential. The feasibility study for this road will examine
its alignment and those of adjacent feeder roads to determine whether a realign-
ment, with appropriate feeder connection changes, would provide an economic
means of access to and through the entire area.
5.12      The Toumodi-Dimbokro-Bongouanou road section, with its extension
northward to Ouelle via Asouakrop provides an east-west link between two
principal highway axes, one serving the north-east and the other the central
and western portions of the country. It will also serve to extend the local
influence of the important railway center of Dimbokro.
5.13      Agricultural and other available data, including traffic movements,
are not sufficiently reliable at present to make reasonable estimates of
benefits, nor are there adequate cost data. The feasibility studies will
include economic analyses of costs and benefits leading to a decision as to
which of the roads should proceed to final engineering.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECONNNDMATIONS
6.1       The project comprises (i) the reconstruction and paving of the
Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road, about 60 km in length; (ii) the supervision
of construction of this road; (iii) feasibility studies of about 700 km of
roads; and (iv) detailed engineering of about 500 km., identified by the
feasibility studies to be of the highest economic priority. The project
is technically and economically sound.
6.2       The cost estimate for construction is based upon detailed
engineering and recent bids for similar works in the Ivory Coast.
6.3       Construction will be carried out by a contractor selected on the
basis of international competitive bidding procedures which are acceptable
to the Bank. The PWD will be responsible for the project; consultants to
assist the PWD will be employed under terms acceptable to the Bank.
6.4       On the road to be constructed, direct benefits to road users and
saving in maintenance are estimated to yield an economic return of about
10 percent. The feasibility studies and detailed engineering could lead to a
further project to develop the road system.
6.5       The Government has given assurances that it will (a) engage
consultants acceptable to the Bank to supervise the construction of
Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road (paragraph 4.4) and to carry out the feasi-
bility studies and subsequent detailed engineering for the roads included
in the project (paragraph 4.12); and (b) select in agreement with the
Bank the roads for detailed engineering on the basis of their economic
justification as shown by the feasibility studies (paragraph 4.7).
6.6       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.8
million equivalent to the Government. A 19-year term, including a 3½-year
period of grace, is appropriate on project grounds.
