REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECrORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A SEEDS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$7.0 million to help
finance a seeds project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
seven years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. USAID is
presently processing a loan of US$5.0 million for crop research.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report ("The Economic Situation and Prospects
of the Republic of Korea", EAP-33a) was distributed under cover of R72-243,
dated November 9, 1972. The Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I. An
Economic Mission has just returned from the field.
3.        The 1972 report commented on Korea's outstanding achievement in
economic development, particularly since the middle of the 1960's, and
noted that Korea's economy was in transition from a situation of high invest-
ment and growth associated with inflation to one of more moderate growth and
greater stability. The most important feature of the transition phase has
been a slowdown in economic activity since the middle of 1971, partly induced
by external facLors but latterly also as a result of the Government's stabili-
zation policy. The GNP growth in 1972 of 7.1 percent, compared with the
average 11.4 percent in the previous five years, was the lowest since 1966,
mainly because of slower expansion of industrial production (16 percent,
compared with the average 21 percent during the previous five-year period),
and a decline in investment (which was 11 percent less than in 1971).
4.        The Government's stabilization efforts, particularly the measures
taken in August 1972 to check inflation and at the same time moderate the
disruptive financial impact of the economic slowdown on Korea's business
sector, seem to be working successfully to bring about a favorable environ-
ment for stable growth. Wholesale prices have been much more stable since
August 1972 after having increased by 8.5 percent in 1971 and at the same
rate in the first eight months of 1972. Recent international currency
revaluations are likely to cause some unavoidable upward pressure, but this
should not jeopardize basic price stability provided the Government continues
to follow its stabilization program. Signs of recovery in industrial
production and investment were visible towards the end of 1972 and some
acceleration of economic expansion has been experienced in 1973. Prospects
for export expansion and further import substitution also seem very
favorable and can be expected to accommodate fairly rapid growth without
balance of payments difficulties.
5.        Two basic aspects of the stabilization policy require continued
emphasis in the future. First, domestic savings mobilization, which has
emerged as a major constraint on future economic development, must be
pursued vigorously. In the process of economic slowdown in the past two



years the savings ratio declined from 18 percent in 1969-70 to about 15 per-
cent in 1972.  Undoubtedly it will recover sorewh-at this year, as the pace
of business activity accelerates. However, long-term improvement depends
very much on further refinement of the financial system and the development
of capital markets. The Government is making valuable efforts toward
improved savings in a setting of stability through a restrained 1973
budget and through measures a!med at improving and diversifying savings
instruments. Second, in the light of the expected investment revival,
it is important to keep overall investment under restraint for some time
to come so that the objectives of the stabilization policies are not
jeopardized. The Government's investment policy for 1973 takes this into
account awd emphasizes increases in agricultural and manufacturing invest-
ment while restraining investment in social overheads and services. In
view oi the rneed to strengthen further the industrial structure and also
to correct urban/rural income disparities through increased rural develop-
ment, this investment policy should be appropriate for the remainder of
the Third Five-Year Plan period (1972-76).
6.        If the economy is managed along the Lines discussed above, a
gradual and continued improvement in the balance of payments can be expected
in the coming years.   With st:rong import demand from the Un:ited 'States and
Japan - Korea's major export markets - merchandise exports increased by about
46 percent in 1972. They are expected to continue to expand rapidly in 1973,
perhaps at the 1972 rate.   A larger and more diversified induistrial sector
will be able to provide the needed export capabl.lity and to assist iraport
substitution efforts, particularly in intermediate industrial goods. Although
increases in imports also are expected as the econormy recovers, the trend
towards c'losing the trade gap seems already established. With some
immediate loss in exchange earnings related to the military establishment
in Korea and Vietnam in addition to the increase in debt payments, external
borrowing requirements are expected to bi particularly large in the next two
years, about US$900 million cross a year.   At this level, assuming a real
GNP growth rate of 8.6 percent, they wll.11 reulain within manageable limits,
both in terms of Korea's debt-carryilng capacity and thte availability of
external finance.   Borrowing requirements could begin to decline after 1975
and the debt service ratio, now at 16 Dercent, is expected to decrease
gradually to the neighborhoocd of 14 percent by 1976, due mainly to the
favorable export outlook.
7.        The Government's external borrowing policy aims at increasing
the proportion of external finance provided by official lenders with a view
to improving further the average borrowino terms.    Also, with more modest
growthi targets, increased emphasis on rutral ic'rks and a gradual shift towards
producing its own capital goods, Korea's need for external loans to finance
imnorted machinery and equipment for large projects will be reduced, although
the total amount of industrial investment and the foreign exchange requirements
thereof .ilt remain high in absolute amount.
8.        A higher proportion of official loans in total borrowing will
require greater efforts bv tne Governrient to prepare Drojects suitable for
official lending; and official lenders will need to provide a larger



- 3 -
proportion of their financial assistance in a form usable for local
expenditure particularly if the Government succeeds in preparing an expanded
agricultural investment program. In these circumstances, some local currency
expenditure financing by the Bank Group is appropriate.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPV.RATIONS I,. KOREA
9.        As at August 31, 1973, Korea had received 11 Bank loans aned 8 IDA
credits amounting in total to US$A410.5 million in loans and US31(07.0 rmillion
in credits (taking into account cancellations and the refinancing of one
IDA credit in a subsequent Bank loan).
10.       Of the US$517.5 million, about one-half has been for the transnort
sector - US$119.7 million for railways, US$54.5 million for hiThways and
US$80 million for ports. The Korea Development Finance Corporation
(KDFC) has received USS95 million in Bank loans for relending to private
industry. US$110.5 million has gone to agricultural projects - US$93 million
for irrigation projects, US$7 million for livestock development and US810.5
million for the provision of medium- and long-term credit through the
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation. The balance of USS57.8 million
was to the education sector.
11.       IFC has made four investments in Korea and its commitments .ot
to US$3.4 million in loans and shares. (A fiftn investment in the Atlas
Paper Co. amounting in total to US85 million was cancelled at the request
of the Company). IFC made its first equity investment in VDFC, of USSO,7
million or 14 percent of KDFC's then paid-in capital, at the time the Bank
made its first loan to KT)FC. In 1971, IFC purcliased US$0.6 -million of the
shares of the Korean Investment and Finance Corporation - a new institution
wh-Lose function is to assist in the development of the capital and money
markets. The Executive Directors approved on July 24, 1973 the exercise
of preemptive rights to purchase at par about USS355,000 equivalent of KDFC's
common stock. Prospects for further IFC investments in Korea are good.
12.       Of total Bank and IDA lending, US$346 million remained undisbursed
as at August 31, 1973. This is mainly due to the fact that withdrawals
tnder several of the large loans made wvi thin the past two years cormencedi
recently. The rate of disbursement has increased over the past year.
13.       Annex II contains a sunmary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits,
and IFC investments as at August 31, 1973, and note-s on the execution of
on--goino, projects.  As indicated in the notes, progress on project implementa-
tion is now generally satisfactorv although difficulties hiave been en-
countered with some projects; and most seriously lwith the Pyonqtaek-Kumngan'
Irrigation Project (Loan 600-KO).
14.       The FY 1974 operations prograr tentatively includes four projects,
in addition to the seeds project. No of these, a tourism project ird a
second highways project, have been appraised.   The otlher two (an autriculturai
prodxcts processing project and a secondary cities development project) are



- 4 -
expected to be appraised before the end of calendar year 1973. This program
is in accord trith a major obJective of the current Third Plan viz, the
narrowing of the income gap between the urban and rural sectors through
increased agricultural investments.  The proposed agricultural products
processing project will aim at increasing on-farm and processed production
of agricultuaral commodities through the provision of credit to farmers,
packers and processors. The proposed secondary cities project will assist
in the development of the Kwangju area, which is a poor, agricultural
region in the southwxest of the country. Bank assistance for the development
of this area has so far focussed on agriculture through the Yong San Gang
river basin project (Loan 795/Credit 283-KO) and on transport development
through completion of sections of the Chonju/Busan national highway linking
Kwangju and Sunchon with the national. primary highway system. The proposed
project will assist in the implementation of the next stage of Govrernmernt's
regional strategy involving investnents in industrial estates, urban
infrastructure, housing and recreational facilities with a view to developing
regional alternatives to the already overcrowded major cities of Seoul
and Busan. The tourism project is intended to exploit the tourism potential
of the Kyongju area. Besides providing the necessary facilities, it will
expand the water supply system and provide a sewerage and solid waste disposal
system for the City of Kyongju.   The construction of a dam to control
floodinig and to provide the water supply source will also permit the
undertaking of a small irrigation project.
15.       The emphasis on7 agricultural and rural development will be reflected
in the operations program for the succeeding years FY 1975 and FY 1976. The
project urnder consideration includes feasibility studies of future irrigation
and area development projects in the Okseo, Naeseong Cheon and Hwang Gang
regions. The report of the agriculture sector 7rdssion, which has recently
been discutssed with the Government, should provide the basis for developing
additional high priority agricultural projects. A second livestock project
and agriculture credit project, a forestry project and the second stage of
the Yong San. Gang project have already been identified.
16.       The other major emplasis in Korea's Tnird Plan, which is supported
by the Bank's economic analysis, is the transitionL from light to heavy
industrial development. The Bank's lending to industry in Korea has been.
through the KDFC. The Government's long-term. industrial strategy is being
examinedi by Bank staff and may leacd to some project financing.
17.       The development of the industrial and agricultural sectors will
require concurrent infrastructure development. Although the transport
sector will. be giver less emphasis than in the past, the investments
required are large and thlus there is considerable support for this sector
in the program.
16.       The annual level of Bank Group support through FY 1976 is expected
to be Ot tt.h same order as the average for the last three years. As
indicated in parae,graph 6, external borrowing requirements may decline after
1975 unless the Government decides to set higher growth and investment
targets.



-5-
19.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt
(disbursed and outstanding) at the end of 1971 was 3.8 percent, and the share
in the debt service was 0.6 percent in the same period.    If the Bank Group's
average annual rate of investment of the past three years continues
(ITS$115-120 million), its share in the total amount of external debt out-
standing will increase sharply to about 10.0 percent by 1978 while the
debt service share would increase to about 7.0 percent.
20.       The Consultative Group continues to be active.    Bilateral
assistance to Korea increased from US$71 million in 1966 to US$281 million in
1971, with the. U.S.A. and Japan being the principal donors, providing some
97 percent of-the total bilateral assistance of USS9O8 million during that
period.
PART III - TIHE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
21.       Agriculture plays a major role in the economy of Korea.    It
employs almost half of the total labor force, accounts for nearly 30 per-
cent of GN?, and provides raw materials and markets for a large share of
Korea's dynamic industrial sector. However, agriculture's importance in
the economy as measured by its share of total employment, GNP, and total
exports has declined in the last decade, and agricultural productiort has
not kept pace with growing market requirements, especially for food grains,
causing the trade deficit for agricultural products to rise fromi US$64
million in 1961 to US$362 million in 1971. Income gains of the rural
population have lagged far behind those in the urban areas.    Real incomes
of farm households increased about 60 percent from 1961 to 1971 while those
of urban households more than doubled in spite of a large migration from
rural to urban areas and substantial increases in the prices of farm.
products under Government programs introduced in 1967.
22.       During the first and second five-year plan periods (1962-1966 and
1967-71), rapid industrial growth was the major objective of Korea's develop-
ment strategy and the urban industrial sector absorbed the greater share of
investment resources. Manufacturing output rose 20 percent annually and
industrial exports 40 percent annually. Output of the agricultural sector
including forestry and fishery, which received only about 6 percent of total
public investment during the first two plan periods, increased at che rate
of 3.5 percent annually.   The failure of agricultural output to keep pace
with rising market requirements (especially for food and food grains) and
of rural incomes to keep pace with those in the urban areas has caused
the Governnent to place greater emphasis on achieving more rapid growth in
the agricultural sector. The major objectives of the new development
strategy are:
(a)  to achieve a more equitable income distribution and
improve rural infrastructure to meet social needs;



(b)  to accelerate expansion in food grain production and
in particular attain greater self-sufficiency in rice;.
ana
(c)  to conserve and develop land and water resources to
build up the resource base for expanding, agricultural
ouput in the future.
23.       Korea is a hilly and mountainotus country w.th about 67 percent
of the land area classified as sui table for forestry, grazing or other
extensive land uses. Cultivated land, about 23 percent of the total, is
located mairtly in river valleys mid in small plains along the western and
southern coasts and amounts only to 0.07 ha per person. Most of the land
sui_able for iLntensive use has been brought under cultivation and it has
became costly to develop additional land for crop production. Rice and
barley are the major crops grown, accounting for 66 percent of the total
crop area and 57 percent of total value of production in 1971. Other food
crops (soybeans and other pulses, potatoes and miscellaneous cereals) grown
mainly in the upland areas account for some 18 percent of the crop area
and 9 percent of total. crop value.
24.       Nearly 15 million people, almost half of the nation's total,
live in 2.5 million farm households mainly located in about 35,000 rural
villages. LIand holdings per household are small and highly fragmented
which makes mechanization difficult. As a result of land refonn carried
out after World War II, most farmers own the land they cultivate. in 1971,
total net income was $964 per farm household of which aboit 20 percent
was fromi non-farm sources. There has been little change in total farm
population or in the average size of land holdings iLn the last decade,
about 4.5 million people having migrated from rural to urban areas.
Crop Production
25.       Crop prodtuction is the major sub-sector witlhin agriculture,
accounting for some 75 percent of total value added to GNP by agricultuire
In 1Q71. Total crop production increased by 3.4 percent annually during
1961-71. Hlowever, the output of basic food crops (rice, barley and other
cereals, pulses and potatoes) increased at 2.5 percent annually. Rice, which
accounted for 36 percent of the total area under crops and 44 percent of the
total value of the crops produced in. 1971, increased only 1.5 percent
annually during the 1961-71 period.
26.       Food grain production has not expanded sufficiently rapidly to
meet the increasing de-mand resulting froTn population and income growth.
Imports of rice, wheat and barley increased to 2.8 million tons in 1972
cawxz:.s3 w-'d with about 500,000 tons annually in the early 1960's. High
prioritvy       o :,OW being given by Government to food grain output expans'ion
so as to aclhievve a greater degree of self-sufficiency. The Third Plan calls
for annual 'increases in grain production from 1970 to 1976 of 3.6 percent,
3.3 percent, 5.3 percent and 14 percent for rice, barley, wheat and corn
respectiveJly. It also calls for large increases in soybeans and other



- 7 -
pulses, fruits and vegetables.   To achieve these targets, the Government is
inplementing programs for land and water resource development, farm mechan-
ization, price support, credit and marketing.
27.       The achievement of higher yields per hectare is of crucial importance
in view of the limited extent of cultivable land. The Korean performance
already surpasses that of most other Asian countries particularly in respect
of rice, barley and wqheat. Further increases are both possible and necessary.
The provision of good quality seed at the farm level andl the supply of improved
varieties through further research are among the means required to increase
crop yields.   The project under consideration has been formulated with these
objectives in mind. It includes arrangements for the production, processing
and distribution to farmers of high qualitv potato, rice, barley, wheat
and soybean seed and for supporting additional research.
Agricultural Institutions
28.       The Ministrv of Agriculture and Fisheries (M-AF) (particularly
its Agricultural Production Bureau) has major responsibilities for planning
and supervising agricultural development programs, hut thev are carried out
mainly by special agencies such as the Office of Rural Development (ORD),
the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) and the National
Agricultural Products Inspection Office (NAPIO). The ORD has responsibility
for agricultural research and rural guidance (extension) employing about
800 research scientists and about 6,000 rural guidance workers. The NACF is
a nation-wide organization comprising about 1,800 primary cooperatives and
148 special purpose cooperatives for marketing, livestock, horticultural
and other crops. It operates about 6,000 rural stores. About 90 percent
of all farmers are members. It carries out Government price support programs,
provides credit and insurance to farmers, markets farm products on its own
account and distributes production inputs to farmers. IDA Credit No. 335-KO
of 1972 increased NACF's resources for medium-term lending to farmers.
NAPIO is responsible for the inspection and regulaticn of quality control
for the agricultural products, including all seeds marketed in Korea. MAF
is advised on overall seed policy by the National Seeds Council (NISC), which
is chaired by the Vice-Minister of M14AF and has broad renresentation from
Government and the Universities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project was prepared with the assistance of the FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Program.   It was appraised in February/Miarch 1973 by a
Bank/FAO team. Negotiations were held from September 10-14, 1973 with a
Government team led by Mr. Kwan Shik Chai, Assistant Minister, Ministry oL
Agriculture and Fisheries.
30.       The existing Government sponsored seeds program produces Tore
than 40,000 tons of field crop and potato seed each year. Elowever, with
seed production widely dispersed in the villages and with insufficient
equipment and antiquated production, processing and storage methods, the



qualIty o: seed available  Eor gene-ral use is poor. 3Farmers are reluctant
to use the .'.overnment seeds because of their l.ow quality.  The proposed
pro]ect woulQ helm solve the problems of seed varietal mixtures, low germina-
tion and seed-borne disease ihlerent in the existing system.   It would also
provide the means for developing new higher-yielding varieties and the
rapid mup.l1tiplication and distribution of the new seeds under quality con-
troLled c,-,ndit'ons.  At full development, an estimated 11,000 tons of Daddy,
5,000 tons of barley, 1,000 tons of wheat, 500 tons of so-bean and 10,850
tons of pota.o would be produced, prc,cessecd, stored and distributed as
Certified seeds.   (The tern "Certified seed"' is used to define the conmnerc ially
wiarketed seed originatirLg from the plant breeder's controlled genetic material
anrd meeting minimum standards of purity and quaIity.)
Detal led Fea%tures
31.       The project woulid finance (a) the iu-istallation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities of about 3,500 tons ca.pacity eacqoh
and si-x seed -otato facilities of about 2,000 tons each; (b) farm niachinery
for seed production; (e) a revolving fund for procuring seasonal seeds
inventories; (d) seed, testing laboratories arni equipment; (e) crop research;
(f) feasibility studies for irrigation and area development. anA (g) technical
assistance.  Aiinex I-LI contains the loa0n aricd project summary,  'he report
"Appraisal of Korean Seeds Project" (No. 202a-KO) is being circulated
separate'ly tc trhe Executive Directors.
32.       The five field crop seed processingw, and storage facilities are to
be in areas w1here oerenrnal ly irrigated  land, maarkets, elactricity and
transport facilities are available and also where groups of farmers interested
in producing seeds are located.   The potato orocnssing and storage plants
are to lke placed in an area of Gang Weon D)o province abJovc 8(0 -m elevation
to facilitate the control of potato virus diseases.
j7,       The f-alrm miachinery is required to ensure the tivneJy plantinrg and
harvesting of the crops to pennit double crcppi-ng on the availa1ble irrigated
lands. Thze Office of Seed Production and Distribution (OSPD) which is to be
set-u:t under the YAF with responsibility for carrying out the Government
program for the production., processing, packag'ng antd distribution of
Cer.ified seed, will purtclase the eq-uipment and hir-e it to the contract
seed growers.  It wvill use the revolving fund to purchase the seed from the
growers inmmediately after it is harvested and to carry the necessary seed
inventories until they are processed   distributed and sold three to nine
monthn-s later. iN_A1 will be provided w-it  laboratorv equipment for quality
controL purposes.
3 .       Despite the sign-ificant achievements in agricultural research,
rhere , s need for additional well-trained research scientists and supporting
labora&o   * , fteld research staticons and other facilities.  A seed program
of the type to 'Oe introduced requiires a streamn of new higher yielding varieties
flowing fram tne research agencies to replace outdated existing varieties.
ORD's research resources w.-ill be strengthened by a research program estimated



-9-
to cost UJS$8 million, of which US$5 million would be forthcoming from an
USAID loan.  During the next five years, the USAID loan will provide for
about 75 man-years of expatriate technical assistance, the training of ORD
and College of Agriculture staff and additional equipment and facilities.
The research will concentrate on improving cereal grains, soybeans, potato
and forage crops.
35.       The proposed loan will finance the foreign exchange cost of two
feasibility studies as a part of this project. One study will test the
feasibility of the proposed Okseo Irrigation and Area Development Project
to be located adjacent to the Pyongtaek-Kuagang Irrigation Project being
financed with a Banik loan (Loan 600-KO). The Okseo project would improve
irrigation and drainage facilities for some 80,000 ha. The second study
would be for the integrated development of two watershed areas: Naeseong
Cheon (178,000 ha) and Hwang Gang (133,000 ha). Both studies would evaluate
integrated projects tailored to the needs of the areas concerned involving,
inter alia, irrigation, water supply, and community development. MTe
Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) has the major responsibility for
the completion of feasibility studies, design and construction of itrigation
and area development projects. Expatriate consultants to be financed under
the proposed project will assist ADC in preparing the studies.
Organization and N4anagement
36.       MAF would be responsible for overall supervision of project invrest-
ments and coordination of the relevant departments, agencies and provincial
governments.  The OSPD will be a separate agency in the LAF and would be
clothed with sufficient financial and managerial autonomy and powers to carry
out the project and to implement a more effective national seeds program.
It is to be established pursuant to the provisions of the Seeds Law, which
is to be amended to make it more effective. The Law at present does not
provide for the registration and regulation of Certified field crop anc
potato seed growers or for the licensing of seed dealers and regulation of
the quality of seeds they market.   The foreign exchange cost of a consultant
to advise on the amendments to the Law is included in the proposed loan. The
Government has undertaken to establish the OSPD within 12 months of the
date of loan effectiveness. Detailed terms and conditions relating to
its establishment, staffing and operations are set out in Schedule 5 to
the draft Loan Agreement. No disbursement would be made, except for
consultants, until these conditions have been fulfilled.
37.       OSPD would contract with a farmers' cooperative (FLIA) near each
plant site for the production of the required quantity of seed and would
procure, process, store and distribute Certified seed throughout the country
mainly through NACF. ORD would expand its crop breeding work and provide
OSPD with Registered seed of the new higher yielding varieties for
multiplication by contract farmers and distribution through NACF to farmers.
Consultants would be hired to advise and train local staff in seed
production, processing, distribution and quality control.    Overseas
scholarships for selected local staff are also provided for.

The total estimated cost of US$522.84 milli on is nvmade up of 2 forelgn exchange
component of US$11 .91 million ard local costs of USS10.93 million.  The
proposed Bank loan will finanace US$6.35 million of the foreign. exchange cost

cost of seed plant equipment, including installation and test operation
costs but less identifiable taxes and duties; it is estimated that this
would involve local cost financing of some US$145,000; (iii) 68 percent of
the total cost of civil works, which represents the foreign exchange com-
ponent of such cost; and (iv) the foreign exchange cost of consultant services
and overseas training. Retroactive financing in an amount not exceeding
US$300,000 is proposed to cover the cost of consultant services provided
after September 1, 1973. These services are required urgently to initiate
project actions for the OSPD and for the feasibility studies.
41.        The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1978.     The first
of the five field crop plants would be ready to receive seed by October
1976 and the remaining four by June 1977. Construction at the Provincial
ORD Registered potato seed farm and of one potato storage plant would be
completed by October 1975 and the remaining four one year later.
42.        During the 30 year estimated life of the proposed project, the
OSPD would recover its full costs (i.e. administration and overhead, procure-
ment, processing, storage, distribution, plant repair and maintenance and
loan service charges) from the sale of seeds.    To recover these costs, field
crop and potato seed prices would have to be 65 percent and 165 percent
respectively above the 1972 harvest prices. Farmers may be unwilling to pay
prices reflecting these mark-ups until the benefits of using the good quality
seed are proven. In the first year, it is expected that mark-uns would be
40 percent on field crop seed and 120 percent on potato seed, increasing over
three or four years to the levels at which full costs can be recovered.
Losses incurred during the early years as a result of this pricing policy
would be considerably less than the US$1 million presently lost by the
Goverranent seed operation each year and would be nmt from OSPDr's annual
budget.
Benefits and Justification
43.        Use of project Certified seed by farners is expecte6 to result in
yield increases of 6 percent for paddy, 12 percent for Darley and w1heat, 10
percent for soybeans and 50 percent for virus-free potato. At these rates
of increase, the project's economic rate of return (ERR) would be 48 rorcc-nt.
If yield increases of only half of these rates xwere obtained, t1he return
would be about 23 percent. With 15 percent higher investment costs and 25
percent lower sales volume, the rate of return would be 33 percent.
44.        Increased production of some 80,000 tons of food grains, 7,500 tons
of oilseeds and 60,000 tons of potato, which is expected annually as a result
of the more effective seeds program, will, at estimated 1980 world market
prices, result in a foreign exchange saving of about USS.14 million. The pro-
ject will also increase the level of income of about 500,000 farmers, about
a fifth of the total number of farmers in Korea.     The estimated net
incremental farm income per hectare accruing to farmers who use the project
Certified seeds would be about USS250 for potato, USt45 for Paddy, US$34 for
naked barley, USS29 for regular barley and( US$25 for wTheat.   The nroposed
project is therefore in accord with tne Government's objectives of increasingz



- 12 -
agricultural production to achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency
and of enhancing farm earnings so as to reduce the existing disparity
between rural and urban incomes.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan is conditional on the fulfillment
of the conditions precedent to the first disbursement of the USAID loan for
crop research. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern of loans
for seed projects.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply ntith the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECO!MENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION'
1.        Loan No. 600         Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project;
US$45.0 million Loan of May 23, 1969
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This is the first major irrigation project constructed in Korea.
It was expected at appraisal that it would irrigate about 35,000 ha. of
land, improve drainage and roads, consolidate all paddy fields, terrace
upland and reclaim tidal land. The start of construction was postponed
by a major reorganization of the executing agency and delay in hiring
consultants; the project is now one year behind schedule. Detailed designs
for the farm distribution system and land development disclosed that
certain areas included in the project are not suitable for gravity
irrigation. The net irrigable area now appears to be around 28,000 ha.
Project costs are expected to be higher than appraised, mainly due to
higher unit prices. Re-examination of the economic analysis indicates
a reduction in the rate of return from 14 percent to 11 percent using revised
rice prices and around 7 percent if prices expected during appraisal are used.
Disbursement is 58 percent behind even when a one-year postponement is applied
to the appraisal report schedule. Construction, however, is now progressing
satisfactorily, and all work is scheduled for completion by the end of
1975.
2.        Credit No. 151       First Education Project; US$14.8 million
Credit of June 4, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project comprises: (a) the expansion and equipment of 27
technical high schools, 5 post secondary technical schools and 4 university
teacher training departments; and (b) 26 man-years of technical assistance,
20 man-years of overseas fellowships to support the development of agri-
cultural and/or technical education and to assist educational planning.
Project implementation is about 18 months behind schedule
because, in its initial stage, delays occurred in the establishment of
the project unit, the selection and appointment of architects and the
formulation of equipment procurement procedures. The project is now
progressing satisfactorily, but it is expected that because of the initial
delays, it will be completed about one year later than estimated at
appraisal.   This may require a postponement of the Closing Date by six
months to June 30, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

3.        Toan No. 669        Third Railway Pro-ect; US$40.0 million Loan
Credit No. 183      and $15.0 million Credit of May 14, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The bulk of the Loan and Credit was earmarked for the purchase
of specific equipment required, namely, freight cars, diesel locomotives,
telecommunications and track maintenance equipment. Progress is generally
satisfactory except for delays in the procurement of some microwave equipment
which caused the Closing Date of the Loan to be postponed from August 31, 1973
to December 31, 1975.
4.        Credit No. 234      Integrated Dairy Beef Development Project;
US$7.0 million Credit of February 11, 1971
Closing Date:  March 31   1977
The development of about 700 small and medium-size dairy farms
by providing long-term loans and the construction and operation of two
dairy products processing plants are the principal components of the
project which also includes management and technical services related to
these activities. The project is progressing satisfactorily,. To date,
nearly 200 Korean farmers have participated. Following international com-
petitive bidding, 1,600 dairy heifers have been purchased and a contract for
the supply of dairy processing equipment awarded; planning and construction
of civil works for the two dairy processing plants are well underway; tech-
nical services are being strenghtened; and applied research for livestock
production is bringing significant results.
5.        Loan No. 622 &      Second and Third KDFC Projects; US$20.0
Loan No. 735        million and US$30.0 million Loans of
June 26, 1969 and May 17t 1971 respectively
Closing Dates: December 31 1973 and
August 31, 1975 respectively
These projects are progressing satisfactorily.   Both Loans are
fully committed.
6.        Loan No. 769        First highways Project; US$54.5 million
Loan of June 29- 1971
Closing Date: November 30, 1975
The project includes the construction of approximately 230 miles
of primary national highways between Chonju and Busan; feasibility studies
of about 870 miles; and detailed engineering of an additional 680 miles.
A highway maintenance study is also being undertaken and a national highway
maintenance organization established on a pilot basis in one of the
provincea.  Corstruction is on schedule and within cost estimates.

7.        Loan No. 795        Yong San Gang Irrigation Project;
Credit No. 283      US$33.0 million Loan and iUS$1S.0 million
Credit of February 2, 1972
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
This is the second major irrigation project financed by the
Bank in Korea.  It aims at transforming an area with the hi ghest drought
frequency in Korea into one with year-round irrigation and crop diver-
sification.  Also there will be increased production of high-value crops.
The Loan/Credit became effective on September 15, 1972. Detailed surveying
and designing are proceedinig satisfactorily and construction has begun on
three of the four dams. Cost estimates have increased by about 19 percent
mainly because of right-of-way costs, more dan foundation grouting than
expected at appraisal, and major changes in designs. About 1,400 ha. of
additional land have been added to the project through revision of original
canal lines, thereby providing benefits which offset the increased costs.
Insufficient funds were budgeted originally for 1973, but the Government
after Bank urging has provided adequate Won financing for the year so that
construction can proceed on schedule. The need for adequate funds in future
years has been discussed with the Government.
8.        Credit No. 335       AgLicultural Credit Project; US$10.5 million
Credit of September 29, 1972
Closing Date; September 1, 1976
This credit supports a three-year lending program for the
development of orchards, agriculture, mushrooms and to encourage poultry
and swine production. A supervision mission visited Korea in July 1973
and reported that the demand for agricultural credit was strong. The
Project still retains the potential to improve farmers' income.    However,
due to the poor selection of Kun Cooperatives and the lack of training and
technical services, the Project has so far not been implemented as planned.
Further loans have been suspended, pending proper training of officials at
both NACF and Kun Cooperative levels, together with a more efficient selection
of cooperatives and an improvement in technical services. These measures have
been agreed with the Government and will be implemented over the next few
months. Loans will be resumed thereafter. The Project is then expected to
achieve its stated objective of increasing production and farmers' income.
A supervision mission scheduled for November this year will review progress
made in the implementation of the necessary measures.
9.        Loan No. 863         Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 million
Loan of November 22, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The main elements of the project are: electrification of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 kms of line running from Seoul
to the northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision
of yard facilities; acquisition of passenger and fretght cars; and improve-
ment of facilities for the mainternance and repair of motive power and rolling

Procurement Arrangements:
All contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or more would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and Credits
(April 1972). Contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 would be
tendered locally on the basis of procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Domestic manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference of 15
percent or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, over the
c.i.f. price of competing imports for machinery and equipment.
Payments under Bank-approved consultants' contracts from
September 1, 1973 would be eligible for retroactive financing.
Consultants:
Consultants would be engaged (i) to assist in project implemen-
tation and advise and train staff in seed production, processing and distri-
bution and (ii) to carry out the two feasibility studies.
Rate of Return:
The economic rate of return to Korea is estimated to be about
48 percent. If the estimated incremental yields were reduced by half,
the rate of return would be about 23 percent.
