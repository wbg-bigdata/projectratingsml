REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to establish a modern seeds
industry for paddy, barley, wheat, soybean and potato in Korea for which
e           a Bank loan of US$7.0 million (Won 2,800 million) has been requested.
ii.       Agriculture contributes about 30% of Korea's GNP, employs about
half the labor force and provides raw materials and labor for a dynamic
industrial sector. Since 1962, manufacturing output has increased at the
rate of 20% per annum, whereas agricultural output has increased at only
3.5% per year. Annual imports of food, i.e., rice, barley and wheat exceed
2.8 million tons; more than five times the rate of seven years ago. The
current Five-Year Plan places greater emphasis on agriculture and rural
development in an effort to achieve a more equitable income distribution
and accelerate food production towards greater self-sufficiency.
iii.      The existing Government sponsored seeds program produces more than
40,000 tons of field crop and potato seed each year. However, with seed
production widely dispersed in the villages and with lack of equipment
and modern production, processing and storage methods, the quality of
seed available for distribution and general use is poor.  Because of their
low quality, farmers do not use the government seeds.  The proposed
project would help solve the problems of seed varietal mixtures, low
germination and seed borne diseases inherent in the existing system. The
project would also provide the means for developing new higher yielding
varieties and the rapid multiplication and distribution of the new seeds
under quality controlled conditions. At full development an estimated
11,000 tons of paddy, 5,000 tons barley, 1,000 tons wheat, 500 tons soybeans
and 10,850 tons potato would be produced, processed, stored and distributed
as Certified seeds. At least 500,000 or 20% of the Korean farmers would
benefit from the use of project Certified seeds. The foreign exchange
savings would be the annual import cost equivalent of about US$14.0 million
for 80,000 tons of foodgrains, 7,500 tons of oilseeds and 60,000 tons of
potato.
iv.       The project would finance (a) the installation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities of about 3,500 tons capacity each
and six seed potato facilities of about 2,000 tons each; (b) farm machinery
for seed production; (c) incremental operating capital for procuring
seasonal seeds inventories; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment;
(e) crop research; (f) feasibility studies for irrigation and area
development; and (g) technical assistance.
v.        The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) would provide
overall coordination for the project. The Office for Seed Production and
*        Distribution (OSPD) would operate the seed facilities.  It would contract
with a farmers cooperative near each plant site for the production of the



- ii -
required amount of seeds and would procure, process, store and distribute
seeds throughout the country. The National Agricultural Products
Inspection Office (NAPIO) would be responsible for quality control. The
agency responsible for agricultural research, the Office of Rural Development
(ORD) would be strengthened by a parallel financing arrangement with USAID.
ORD would expand its crop breeding work and provide OSPD with Registered
seed of the new higher yielding varieties for multiplication and distribution
to farmers. Expatriate consultants would assist with the feasibility
studies and in the implementation of the project and the training of staff.
vi.       The project, as proposed, would cost US$22.8 million (Won 9,132
million). Of this amount, the Bank would finance US$7.0 million and the
USAID would finance US$5.0 million. The ROK would provide US$10.8 million.
Disbursement under the Bank loan would cover the cost of seed plants,
equipment, vehicles, consultant services and overseas training. It would
also cover 68% of the cost of civil works. All contracts above US$50,000
would be awarded after international competitive bidding.
vii.      Project Certified seeds, when used by farmers to replace local
seeds, would be expected to obtain yield increases of 6% for paddy, 12%
for barley and wheat, 10% for soybeans and 50% for virus-free potato.
At these rates of increase, the project's economic rate of return (ERR)
would be 48%. If yield increases of only half of these rates were obtained
the ERR would be 23%. With 15% higher investment costs and 25% lower
volume the rate of return would be 33%.  Rates of return are sensitive
to crop yield responses due to the use of Certified seeds, prices for
seeds, grains and potato, the inclusion of seed potato and the achievement
of targeted full development vollmp.
viii.     During negotiations the ROK agreed to complete acceptable
arrangements for parallel financing of ORD with USAID and to establish
the OSPD.  It also provided assurances regarding administrative and
operational arrangements. The appropriate assurances having been agreed,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$7.0 million for 25 years
including seven years grace with interest.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Republic of Korea (ROK) has requested a Bank loan to help
finance (a) improvements in its existing seeds industry and to develop new
higher yielding varieties of cereal crops, oilseeds and potato for
multiplication and distribution to farmers and (b) feasibility studies for
two irrigation and area development projects. The proposed project would
make an important contribution to the achievement of ROK's current five-year
development plan which places increased emphasis on agriculture and rural
development.
1.02      The proposed loan would be in addition to the Bank Group Loan-Credits
previously granted for agricultural development projects in Korea. Two were
for irrigation, Bank 600-KO for US$45 million and a combined IDA Credit 283-KO
and Bank Loan 795-KO for US$48 million. IDA 234-KO of US$7.0 million was for
livestock development and 335-KO of US$10.5 million was for an Agricultural
Credit project. These projects support ROK's agricultural development strategy
which has the following objectives: (a) achieving a more equitable income
distribution; (b) improving rural infrastructure to meet social needs; (c) con-
serving and developing land and water resources; and (d) accelerating and
expanding food grain and potato production to attain greater self-sufficiency
in foods.
1.03      The proposed project was prepared with the assistance of the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and submitted to the Bank by ROK. This
report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. Dorris D. Brown, U. Hpu, L. Lundquist (IBRD); A.A. Huysmans (FAO)
and L.S. Foster (Consultant) that visited Korea in February/March 1973.
II. NEED FOR THE PROJECT
A. General
2.01      Agriculture accounts for about 30% of Korea's GNP, employs about
half the labor force and provides raw materials for a large share of the more
dynamic industrial sector. Since 1962, manufacturing output has increased
by about 20% and industrial exports by 40% annually; much higher than the 3.5%
growth rate for agricultural production including forestry and fisheries.
Under-employed farm labor has migrated to the urban areas. However, real
incomes of farm households increased about 60% from 1961 to 1971 while real
incomes of urban households more than doubled (Annex 1).



-2 -
2.02      Korea has only 2.3 million ha of cultivated land, about 0.07 ha
per person for its population of over 30 million. About 2.5 million farm
families live in 35,000 rural villages and operate small and fragmented
land holdings that average 0.9 ha per household. As a result of land
reforms initiated in 1950, almost all farms are owner-operated. An
aggressive consolidation and land development program executed by the
Farmer's Land Improvement Association (FLIA), has regrouped about half of
the fragmented paddy land into larger operating units. About two-thirds
of the paddy, barley and wheat lands are irrigated. Farmers are progressive
and diligent workers, eager to apply new technology that increases output
and income.
2.03      Agricultural output, excluding forestry and fisheries, increased
at an annual rate of 3.3% during 1961 to 1971. About two-thirds of the
increase in crop output was from higher yields and one-third from expanded
area planted. Livestock, poultry, fruits, vegetables and industrial crops
production increased rapidly. The 1967-71 average cropped area, production
and yield by provinces are given in Annex 1, Table 1, illustrated on
IBRD Map 10447, and summarized below:
Area      Production      Yielfd
(mil. ha)   (mil. tons)   (Kgs/ha)
Paddy                             1.20         5.23         4,358
Regular Barley                     .44         1.17         2,643
Naked Barley (huskless)            .48         1.33         2,755
Wheat                              .15           .34        2,216
Soybeans                           .30          .23           756
Potato (White)                     .06          .60        10,625
Agricultural production has not kept pace with growing market requirements.
The import of 2.8 million tons of rice, barley and wheat in 1972 was more
than five times that of the early 1960s.
2.04      The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) is responsible
for the planning and implementation of agricultural development programs.
Assisted by the Economic Planning Board (EPB) it plans, finances and
monitors numerous departmental agencies and organizations. It operates an
extensive price policy and grain procurement program through the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) that assures farmers of relatively
high crop production incentives and easy availability of such inputs as
fertilizers, plant protection materials and improved seeds. MAF channels
most of its field activities of direct concern to farmers through the
nine provincial governments which have similar organizational structures.
2.05      Government support programs for barley, soybeans, maize and other
crops liave been carried out by the MAF to encourage output expansion
and to improve farm incomes. Producer prices for rice and other grains
were near those at which imports were available in 1965, but the Government
support price for rice was raised each year until it reached US$242 per metric
ton in 1972, about 50% above the import price of US$166 a ton. Producer



-3-
support prices for polished barley have been at 67% of those for rice, but
the retail price of barley has been maintained at 50% of that for rice in
order to encourage consumption substitution of barley for rice. Real
incomes per farm household have increased since 1965 largely as the
result of higher farm product prices. However, rice production has not
increased significantly indicating that other measures such as improved
water management, new high yielding varieties, and better disease and pest
control practices may be required to expand production.
2.06      Korea's land, water and human resources provide the potential for
a mnre dynamic agricultural sector. The ROK five-year development plans
emphasize development and dissemination of new farming technologies as
well as investment in rural infrastructure. The proposed project with its
crop research, seeds and feasibility studies of irrigation and area develop-
ment forms a part of this strategy.
B. Agricultural Research, Extension and Credit Institutions
2.07      Research:  The Office of Rural Development (ORD) carries out the
MAF agricultural research program. Facilities for research work on cereal
crop breeding and cultural practices are located at Suweon and at field
stations at Honan and Milyang. The new high yielding Tongil variety of
paddy was developed by a College of Agriculture plant breeder working with
the ORD staff. Since its release in 1970, this variety has spread to
about one-sixth of the paddy area. Another promising high yielding
variety of paddy is likely to be released for seed multiplication by 1975
or 1976. Other promising varieties are under laboratory and field tests
(Annex 3).
2.08      Research on barley is being undertaken in attempts to improve
resistance to cold weather and develop earlier maturity of higher yielding
varieties. Wheat and soybean research includes the testing of exotic
varieties. Potato research is concentrated at the Alpine Station in Gang
Weon Do province where the breeding of improved crosses with the local
Irish Cobbler variety and the control of virus diseases receives major
emphasis. A new higher yielding variety is under field test for probable
release by 1975.
2.09      A seeds program of the type proposed requires a stream of new,
higher yielding varieties flowing from the research agencies to replace
outdated existing varieties. Despite improvements in recent years, ORD's
research resources are inadequate to support a seed production and
distribution program as extensive as the proposed project. It is not
adequately staffed, particularly in the plant breeding aspects of plant
pathology, entomology and cereal chemistry. ORD also needs additional
equipment to enable it to expand its crop research and to produce the
Foundation and Registered seed needed for the project. The Government is
arranging to finance ORD's needed support through a loan agreement with
the USAID (See para 3.12).



-4-
2.10      Extension:  ORD is the executing agency, assisted by the provincial
governments, for agricultural extension education programs. Technical
guidance and training given by ORD is extended by about 6,500 Rural Guidance
(Extension) Officers (RGOs) and 15,000 agricultural workers and leaders
posted in country and local offices. They assist farmers obtain production
inputs and use improved cultural practices consistent with the latest
research results. The agricultural staff has supported the existing govern-
ment seed program by conducting crop demonstrations, arranging for progres-
sive farmers to grow seeds of the recommended varieties and assisting in
the distribution of seed supplies (Annex 1).
2.11      Colleges of Agriculture:  The Colleges of Agriculture (COA) in
the Ministry of Education engage in crop research and training of technicians
in crop breeding, cultural practices and extension. The COA have expertise
in plant pathology and plant chemistry that, in general, are not available
with ORD. ORD engages selected COA staff members to assist in some of its
crop research and staff training work. However, lack of coordination between
the MAF and the Ministry of Education and inadequate financing has hindered
full cooperation between the COA staff and ORD.
2.12      Agricultural Credit:  The Government sponsored cooperative system,
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF), is the main source of
institutional credit. Interest rates for NACF credit range from 3.5% for
long term irrigation loans to 15.5% for certain kinds of medium term
production and facility loans.  The largest volume of loans is at 9%.  These
rates may be compared with Korean Development Bank industrial loans ranging
from 7.5 to 16.5% and commercial bank rates mainly in the 6 to 15.5% range.
Farmers get most of their credlt frm non-institutional sources at rates of
4 to 6% per month. Loans available in the cooperative system from the
Government budget and from its own banking operations fall far short of
meeting the demand at the terms offered so rationing of available credit by
NACF is necessary.  There are no good estimates of aggregate credit needs
of farmers, but lack of credit has not retarded growth in use of fertilizer
or pesticides and is not expected to restrain the proposed seeds project
(Annex 1).
C. The Seeds Industry
2.13      Agricultural Production Bureau (APB):  The APB is responsible for
the planning and implementation of agricultural development programs includ-                a
ing the national field crop and potato seeds program. It performs these
functions in cooperation with the Economic Planning Board, ORD, and the
provincial governments. Seed varieties to be multiplied and distributed
are determined by the provincial governments. ORD multiplies the Breeder
and Foundation seeds of these varieties and provides Foundation seeds to
the Provincial Organization for Rural Development (PORD) seed farms. The
next stage, Registered seed produced on the PORD seed farms, is distributed
by each provincial government to its selected seed growers located in most
villages for reproduction as "Certified" seed.  The seed growers distribute
this seed to village farmers under an ad hoc system and receive varying



-5-
incentive payments from the provincial government for their seed production
distribution operations. There is an organized private sector seeds industry
for vegetable and flower seeds but not for field crops and potato (Annex 2).
2.14      Registered seed potato is produced at the PORD seed farm in Gang
Weon Do province (See IBRD Map No. 10516) and distributed to selected growers
in all of the provinces. Seed borne virus diseases develop when this seed is
reproduced at altitudes below 800 m. Thus, some of the seed potato avail-
able for general distribution is not free from diseases and its quality
degenerates rapidly. Average potato yields of 10.6 tons per ha are much
lower than the potential of 15 tons with existing varieties and over 20
tons with new varieties.
2.15      The National Seeds Council (NSC):  Overall policy direction of the
seeds industry is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agricultlire advised
by the National Seeds Council (NSC) which consists of the MAF Vice-Minister
as Chairman and representatives of MAF, ORD, NAPIO and the Universities
(Annex 3). The NSC has not had the desired influence on the natioiual seeds
policy that the Seed Law intended; mainly, because (a) the provincial govern-
ments and the seeds industry have not been represented on the Council; (b)
it has not had a role in guiding minimum regulatory standards and procedures;
and (c) it has not been concerned with the effect of crop improvement research
policies on the seeds industry. As a result, non-recommended varieties with
relatively poor performance continue to be multiplied and distributed by the
provincial governments without adequate control of seed quality.
2.16      The National Agricultural Products Inspection Organization (NAPIO):
The National Agricultural Products Inspection Organization (NAPIO) is
responsible for the inspection and regulation of quality control for all
agricultural products, including seeds, that move through domestic and
export market channels (Annex 5). Its basis of authority for seeds is
derived from the Seed Law of Staple Crops, (Law No. 975) January 16, 1962,
as amended. The central office in Seoul has an administrative and technical
staff with laboratories and equipment needed to perform its functions for
agricultural food products. Field staff and facilities are maintained at 141
local offices. Its work in seed inspection and quality control has been
restricted mostly to vegetable seeds. The provincial Governments have been
reluctant to use its services for seeds produced and marketed by selected
village farmers. In the few cases where NAPIO services were requested, such
seeds usually failed to pass field and laboratory inspections for purity
and germination.
2.17      The Seeds Law reflects awareness of the requirements for the
control of seed quality by defining the successive multiplication procedures
through the Breeder, Foundation, Registered and Certified seed stages. It
specifies minimum standards for Certified seed of each promulgated crop. It
defines the responsibilities of the agencies concerned - ORD, NAPIO and
others - and provides penalties for non-compliance. However, the system
breaks down on compliance with quality control at the Certified seed
multiplication and distribution stages. The law does not provide for the
registration and regulation of Certified field crop and potato seed growers
or for the licensing of seed dealers and regulation of the quality of seeds



-6-
they market. The services of NAPIO are not used. Indeed, NAPIO does not
have adequately trained staff for field inspection of a progressive Certified
seed production and marketing program. It lacks laboratory equipment and
trained staff for seed sample analysis.
2.18      Government Seeds:  Seed production and distribution by the Govern-
ment seed program for 1969-71 was estimated as follows:

2.19      Seed production incentive payments and staff operations cost the
Government over US$1.0 million per year. Quality control measures for
varietal and species purity and germination have not been applied
successfully at the selected seed grower and distribution levels. Some
of the seeds produced have been consumed as foodgrain or potato rather
than used as seed.  Because of low quality and poor performance, demand for
"Certified" seeds has diminished.
D. Irrigation and Area Development
2.20      In Korea, the expansion of crop production depends almost
entirely on increasing output from the presently cultivated area. In the
last decade the area of paddy used to grow two crops - paddy and barley or
wheat - increased from 402,000 ha to 634,000 ha. But over 600,000 ha of
paddy land continues to be used to grow only one crop, mainly because of
poor drainage and lack of irrigation facilities. The ROK plans to make large
investments for land and water resource development to expand its agricul-
tural production base, help achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains,
control erosion, reduce flood damage and improve rural income. The Agricul-
tural Development Corporation (ADC) has the major responsibility for the
completion of feasibility studies, design and construction of irrigation
and area development projects. However, ADC does not have the staffing and
expertise needed to implement projects currently under construction (para
1.02) and simultaneously prepare feasibility studies for all of the new
projects under consideration for the Third Plan (1972-76). They therefore
require assistance from consultants in project planning and implementation.
At the Government's request, financing for the engagement of consultants and
other foreign exchange expenditures associated with the preparation of two
feasibility studies, one by ADC and one by MAF, are being included as part            0
of this project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
3.01      The project would finance the establishment of a mdern seeds
industry in Korea, strengthen the agencies responsible for crop research
(ORD) and for seed certification (NAPIO) and provide for feasibility studies
of prospective irrigation and area improvement works. At full development,
the seed facilities would procure, process, store and distribute 11,000 tons
paddy, 5,000 tons barley, 1,000 tons wheat, 500 tons soybeans and 10,850 tons
seed potato as Certified seed per annum. Yield increases resulting from
the investment would benefit directly more than 500,000 Korean farmers and
help ROK achieve greater food self-sufficiency.
3.02      The project would include:
(a) the installation of five field crop seed processing and
storage facilities of about 3,500 tons capacity each and
six seed potato facilities of about 2,000 tons each;
(b)  farm machinery for seed production;
(c)  a revolving fund for seed procurement;
(d) seed testing laboratories and equipment for quality
control (NAPIO);
(e) staff, equipment and training for crop research (ORD);
(f) feasibility studies for the Okseo-Naeseong Cheon and
Hwang Gang irrigation and area development regions (MAF-ADC);
and
(g) technical assistance.
3.03      The MAF would provide overall guidance and coordination for the
project.  A new agency, the Office for Seed Production and Distribution
(OSPD) would be established in the MAF under a revised Seeds Law to operate
the seed production, processing and storage facilities and distribute the
seeds. The NAPIO would be responsible for seed quality control. The USAID
would provide parallel financing for the ORD crop research. The MAF and
Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) would supervise the feasibility
studies. The project would be completed in five years with retroactive
financing of Bank approved consultancy contracts from September 1, 1973.

B. Detailed Features
3.04      Field Crop Seed Processing:  The five field crop seed processing
and storage facilities would be located at Pyeongtaeg, Iri, Hampyeong,
Euiseong and Milyang (see IBRD Map 10516).  Criteria used to determine
plant locations included (a) availability of perennially irrigated Land
for seeds production; (b) distance and transportation resources to potential
markets for seeds; (c) farmers interested in adopting the procedures required
to produce certified seeds; and (d) the availability of electricity,
housing and staff amenities.
3.05      Each plant would be provided with identically designed intake,
conveying, drying, cleaning, treating and packaging equipment to process
about 1,500 tons of barley and wheat during the first 15 or 20 days in
June. The same equipment could process over twice this volume of paddy
and soybeans during the 30 to 45 day October-November harvesting and
drying season. Minor changes in building design and storage capacities
would accommodate the availability of local building materials and differences
in quantities and types of seeds to be processed at each location. Details
including a typical plant layout are given in Annex 4. Plant equipment
specifications are given in Annex 9.
3.06      At full development, the five plants would process, store and
distribute 11,000 tons of paddy, 5,000 tons barley, 1,000 tons wheat and
500 tons soybean as Certified seed.  These quantities represent estimated
demand for the existing varieties and would provide the following
proportions of the national annual seed requirements: paddy, 23%; barley,
8%; wheat, 12%; and soybeans, 3%. The projected volumes are substantially
lower than the amounts distributed in 1970 and 1971 (see para 2.18).
flowever, the volume and proportions would change with demand and when
new varieties of paddy, barley and soybeans are approved for multiplication
by the project as expected in 1975 and 1976 (Annex 3). With adjustments
in operating procedures and additions to storage, if needed, the volume
processed could be expanded.
3.07      Seed Potato Storage and Processing Plants:  To control virus
diseases, seed potato must be produced at elevations above 800 m and with
a regime of plant protection from insects and diseases. The project would
provide potato grading and treating equipment and storage facilities to
produce about 2,000 tons of Registered seed potato at the Daegwanryeong
PORD seed potato farm in Gang TWeon Do province and similar facilities at
five nearby locations to produce 10,000 tons of Certified seed under
contract with farmers located above 800 m elevation on the scattered and
remote cultivable land in the region.  The adjacent ORD Alpine Potato
Research Station would provide research and technical assistance. Management
of the ELegwanryeong PORD seed potato farm, now owned by ORD would be
transferred to the OSPD. This transfer is necessary to assure OSPD of its
supply of Registered seed and to operate the farm more efficiently in
relation to its needs. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
the transfer would be made.



-9-
3.08      Farm Machinery for Seed Production:  At most of the cereal plant
sites, barley and wheat would be planted after the paddy seed harvest in
October. The barley and wheat seed must be harvested in about 15 days
during early June and the land immediately prepared for transplanting
paddy before the first of July. Similar timely operations are required
for seed potato production. Bullock operated equipment which most farmers
use and the current short agricultural labor supply would not permit these
operations to be completed within the time constraints. Consequently,
tractors and machinery for land preparation and harvesting operations would
be provided to the OSPD for hire to farmers.
3.09      Registered Seed:  In the existing seed industry the ORD plant
breeders are responsible for the production of the Registered seed for
field crops at the PORD seed farm in each province (Annex 2). This
arrangement would be continued under the project. However, the PORD farms
that would be used for the production of the Registered seed requirements
of the OSPD lack modern seed production and processing equipment which
the project would provide. During negotiations, the Bank was assuiad that
ORD would continue to be responsible for the production of Registered seed
of the recommended varieties and in the amounts required by OSPD for
multiplication as Certified seed.
3.10      Seed Certification and Quality Control:  To produce and market
seeds of cereal crops, soybean and potato that meet acceptable inspection
and quality control standards for certification, it would be necessary to
revise the Seed Law of Staple Crops, Law No. 975 and strengthen NAPIO's
seed inspection and laboratory facilities and equipment (para 2.17 and
4.14).
3.11      Technical Assistance and Training:  The MAF has limited experience
and technical talent in the production, procurement and processing of seeds
that meet acceptable quality standards for Certified seed (para 2.13 - 2.19).
Therefore, the project would provide about 14 man-years of expatriate tech-
nical assistance to advise and train the OSPD and NAPIO management and
staff in the performance of these functions. Training would be guided by
the consultants and would include overseas scholarships. Proposed draft terms
of reference for the consultants are given in Annex 6. During negotiations,
assurances were given that consultants would be selected in accordance
with procedures and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
3.12      Crop Research - Parallel Financing:  The project's success would
depend, in part, on the systematic introduction of new higher yielding
varieties for each crop (paras 2.07 - 2.09). To achieve this objective,
the ROK is arranging with the USAID for the financing of additional crop
research. Their loan would, during the next five years, provide for about
75 man-years of expatriate technical assistance of a team of plant breeders,
pathologists, entomologists, agronomists, agricultural engineers and farm
management economists, the training of ORD and COA staff, additional equip-
ment and facilities. The work would concentrate on the improvement of
cereal grains, soybeans, potato and forage crops.  The estimated costs have
been included in project financing. Tentative details are given in Annex 3.
It would be a condition of effectiveness that arrangements acceptable to



- 10 -
the Bank had been finalized by ROK and USAID for the financing of additional
crop research.
3.13      Feasibility Studies of Future Projects:  The loan also would
finance the foreign exchange cost (US$900,000) of two feasibility studies
(para 2.20).  The first would be the Okseo Irrigation and Area Development
Project located south of the Geun River and adjacent to the Iskan and Nonsan
subdivisions of the Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan 600-KO).  The
project would improve irrigation and drainage in some 80,000 ha presently
irrigated mainly by gravity from a 'Large number of storage reservoirs and
provide for construction of an irrigation and drainage system to serve about
52,000 ha presently cultivated under rainfed conditions. The project would
also include provisions for community development as well as municipal and
industrial water supply. A consulting firm would be engaged, under ter.ns
of reference as outlined in Annex 6, Appendix B, to assist the Agricultural
Development Corporation in implementing this study which is expected to be
conpleted by September 1974.
3.14      The second study would be for the integrated development of two
watershed areas: Naeseong Cheon (178,000 ha) and the Hwang Gang (133,000 ha).
Field work would start in September, 1973 and would be completed by December,
1974. The proposed project preparation would be based largely on the work
of the UNDP/FAO Upland Development and Watershed Management Project in Korea
and would include physical surveys, map preparation of semi-detailed soil and
land use capabilities; agro-economic surveys; investigation of water storage
facilities including sites for new dams, improvement of new dams and selection
of sites for fish ponds; and surveys of existing communities and prospective
community development programs. The proposed project would likely include
erosion control and reforestation in the basin catchments, bench terraces for
orchards and field crops, pasture improvement, small reservoirs and structures
for irrigation, land consolidation, fish ponds and community development
activities for beef, pig and poultry schemes, farm mechanization, storage.
village water supply, etc. The Korean counterparts of the UNDP/FAO project
have been trained in feasibility study and project preparation work for the
past six years and would assume the responsibility for this study. Polif cy
direction would be provided by a coordinating committee established by t1he
MAF on April 10, 1973 and under the Cnairmanship of the Vice-Minister. The
above Korean staff would implement the study with assistance from consultants
engaged on short-term assignments under procedures and terms of reference
acceptable to -the Bank.
C.  Cost Estimates and Financial Arran&ements

3.16      These estimates were based on 1973 quotations cif Korean ports for
equipment expected to be imported and local rates for civil works and admin-
istration. The local expenditures for consultants was included under admin-
istration. A physical contingency of 10% and price contingencies of 5% for
local expenditures and 12% per annum for foreign exchange were calculated for
items under Sections 1, 2 and 3 above.  The amounts given in Sections 4 and

3.18-     The proposed Bank loan of US$7.0 million (Won 2,800 million) to
ROK would finance about 31X of the estimated project cost. Terms would be
for 25 years with seven years grace and annual interest. ROK would use
about US$5.6 million, including contingencies to finance the installation
of seed plants. The remainder of the Bank loan would be used by ROK to
finance machinery and equipment for the PORD seed farms (US$93,000), NAPIO
(US$343,000) and the feasibility studies (US$900,000).  The USAID parallel
financing of US$5.0 would be for ORD crop research and represents 22% of
project costs.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
3.19      The civil works and machinery and equipment for the five field crop
seed processing plants, estimated at US$2.0 million, including installation
and test-run, would be subject to international bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement. Bids would be called on the basis
of two alternatives: either (a) one single contract for the supply and
construction of the five plants; or (b) one single machinery and equipment
supply and erection contract for the five seed plants and five separate
civil works contracts. Prequalified contractors could bid on any one or
a combination of the works. The civil works for the seed potato storage
facilities estimated at US$835,000 would be bid separately. Farm machinery
(US$1.1 million) and vehicles (US$223,000) would be purchased by international
bidding.  Domestic bidders offering machinery and equipment of substantial
Korean origin would be entitled to a 15% preference or actual import duty,
whichever is less. Other equipment (including the seed potato processing
equipment, seed certification laboratory equipment and office equipment),
costing less than US$50,000 when bulked, would be procured directly from
local or international supplier under arrangements acceptable to the Bank.
Civil works for the NAPIO laboratories (US$78,000) are at seven scattered
locations and would be tendered locally. Consultants would be appointed
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. The MAF would nominate key OSPD
and NAPIO staff members for international training under arrangements
acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations assurances were obtained from
ROK on the above arrangements.
3.20      Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan would be against the
following items: (a) the cif or ex-factory cost less identifiable taxes
and duties, of all farm machinery, vehicles and seed quality control
equipment; (b) 100% of the total cost of seed plant equipment inclusive of
the local costs of installation and test operations (US$145,000) less iden-
tifiable taxes and duties; (c) 68% of the cost of civil work contracts award-
ed under arrangements acceptable to the Bank; and (d) the foreign exchange
cost of technical assistance and overseas training.  Due to the need to use
consultants to initiate project actions for the OSPD and for the feasibility
studies, retroactive financing of not to exceed US$300,000 would be accept-
able for consultant services provided after September 1, 1973 with the
approval of the Bank. Disbursements would not be made against costs of land

acquisition, administration, Revolving Fund capital and local costs for
the consultants, training, crop research and feasibility studies. The
schedule for disbursement is in Annex 10.
IV.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGENENT
A. General
4.01      The MAF would be responsible for overall supervision of project
investments and coordination of the appropriate departments, agencies and
provincial governments. The OSPD would be responsible for the operation
of the seed plants including the production, procurement, processing,
storage and distribution of seeds. NAPIO would manage the seed certifica-
tion services for the project and for the Korean seeds industry (para 2.16
and Annex 5). Crop research and the production of Breeder, Foundation and
Registered seed would be managed by ORD (para 2.07 and Annex 3). The NSC
would assist the MAF by recommending seed varieties for multiplication each
crop season and by providing suggested general standards for seed certifi-
cation and regulation of the industry (para 2.15 and Annex 3). All of
these departments and agencies, except OSPD are experienced in working
together under the leadership of the MAF for the operation of the existing
crop research and seed programs (Annex 2).  The MAF and ADC would supervise
the feasibility studies (para 2.20).  Functional responsibilities for each            0
department and agency are summarized below and detailed in Annex 6.
B. The Office for Seed Production and Distribution (OSPD)
4.02      The OSPD would be established by the ROK by amending the Seed Law
of Staple Crops (Law No. 975) of January 16, 1962 as amended (Annex 6). It
would operate as a separate agency in the MAF under regulations issued
pursuant to the Seed Law and under the direction of a Chief Executive
Officer who would be responsible directly to the Assistant Minister.
Administrative divisions of the OSPD would be responsible for project
administration and operations, financing and budget control, seed production
and procurement, farm machinery operations and seed processing and distri-
bution. A manager trained in seeds production processing, storage and
marketing, would be in charge of operations at each seed plant.  During
negotiations agreement was reached regarding the following conditions:
(a) OSPD would be established by not later than 12 months from
the date of loan effectiveness and with satisfactory terms,
conditions, regulations and administrative procedures
acceptable to the Bank;
(b) No disbursement would be made, except for consultants, until
the above conditions had been fulfilled;



- 15 -
(c)  The Chief Executive Officer posted would be acceptable to
the Bank; and
(d) The Chief Executive Officer and each of the administrative
divisional officers and plant managers as specified in the
staffing plan would be employed under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
4.03;     The Chief Executive Officer would prepare a budget that estimates
the capital and operating expenditures, including contingencies prior to
the beginning of each fiscal year.  He would be entitled to transfer, with
prior advice to the Minister of EPB, between categories and sub-categories
or groups the funds allocated by the budget. The investment line headings
would be more or less as given in Annex 7, Table 1. Operation line headings
would include a Revolving Fund (para 4.04) and a separate account for the
hire-operation of the farm machinery provided by the project.
4.04      The OSPD would receive financing from ROK for its investment and
operating budget on an annual basis and for its Revolving Fund on a permanent
basis. The Revolving Fund would be used for the procurement of seeds from
contract growers and would be credited with the entire proceeds of its seeds
sales less distribution expenses. Surpluses, if any, could be used for annual
operating expenses including service charges on loans. During negotiations,
ROK agreed to finance and maintain the Revolving Fund at the commencement of
the fiscal year with not less than the Won equivalent of US$300,000 in 1975,
US$1.1 million in 1976, US$4.1 million in 1977 and US$5.4 million in 1978
and thereafter.
Seed Production, Procurement and Processing
4.05      The OSPD would be responsible for implementation of all aspects of
the project concerning the production, processing, packaging and distribution
of Certified seeds. In this respect the Chief Executive Officer and his
administration and operations divisions, with the assistance from domestic
and expatriate consultants would design each seed plant, specify equipment,
prepare tender documents, evaluate bids and supervise construction of civil
works and the installation of equipment. After construction has been com-
pleteed, the staff would be trained by the suppliers and the consultants in
the operation of the seed plants. The budget control division would maintain
project investment and operations accounts on a commercial accounting basis.
4.06      The OSPD would contract with a Farmers Land Improvement Association
(FLIA), a large cooperative farming organization, at each plant location
for the production of predetermined amounts of field crop seeds of the
recommended varieties. A typical FLIA operates between 600 and 6,000 ha
and has 500 to 5,000 farmer members.  Criteria for the selection of each FLIA
would include: (a) established perennial irrigation including completed
land leveling, installation of field distributaries, drainage and access
tracks; (b) soils without major hazards and capable of producing high
yields of paddy and barley with double cropping; (c) able management and
members willing to perform the cultural practices needed to produce
*        Certified seeds; and (d) located near the plant site.  A FLIA with these



- 16 -
characteristics has been tentatively identified at each proposed plant site.
The contractual arrangement with the FLIA management would identify the
blocks of land and describe the operations agreed to for the production of
Certified seeds of the NSC recommended varieties only. Not more than three
varieties of any crop would be produced and processed at each seed plant.
4.07      At targeted production the approximate area and quantities required
at each seed plant location would be:
Paddy         Soybeans          Barley           Wheat
ha    tons      ha   tons        ha    tons       ha   tons
Pyeongtaeg       715   2,850      310  250         425    850      175    350
Iri              635   2,550       65   50         525  1,050       75    150
Hampyeong        450   1,800       -    -          550  1,100       50    100
Euiseong         575   2,300      250  200         450    900      150    300
Milyang          375   1,500       -    -          550  1,100       50    100
TOTAL        2,750  11,000      625  500       2,500  5,000      500  1,000
4.08      ORD would be responsible for the production and delivery of Regis-
tered seed of the recommended varieties to OSPD.  The OSPD would provide
each FLIA with Registered seed at cost for each variety to be produced.
In most cases, the Registered seeds would be produced on the PORD seed farms.
The OSPD farm machinery would be available on a hire basis to each FLIA
for land preparation, crop dusting and spraying, harvesting and threshing
and delivery of seed to the processing plant. The OSPD would assign its
Agricultural Officers to work with each FLIA to assure production of high
yields of seed that qualify under the standards as Certified seed. The
FLIA and its member-seed growers would be paid a premium ranging from 10%
to 20% above market price, depending on the crop, for that part of the
harvest that met the minimum standards for certification when delivered to
the OSPD processing plant. The cost of Registered seed, farm machinery hire
and other inputs provided to the FLIA by OSPD would be deducted from the
value of the crop.
4.09      The barley and wheat produced by the FLIAs would be delivered to
the processing plant after harvest in early June and tested for acceptance.
If acceptable, it would then be dried immediately to 12 to 14% moisture and
bulk stored in aerated bins until about the middle of August. The seed
would then be fine cleaned, treated, packaged and delivered to the NACF
wholesale and retail stores early in October on the basis of estimates of
demand confirmed by each provincial government. Paddy and soybean would
follow this same routine starting with the harvest and threshing in early
October and delivery to the wholesalers and retailers by the end of March.
Seeds would be packaged in sealed 5 to 30 kg units and labelled as
specified by the standards set by NAPIO. Surplus seeds not treated with
chemicals could be sold on the consumer market or held in reserve.
4.10      The OSPD would produce Registered seed potato on its farm at
Daegwanryeong.  This seed would be distributed to its contract seed growers,



- 17 -
all located on farms above 800 m elevation and used for the production of
Certified seed. The seed potato would be harvested in October, rough
graded and stored before freezing weather begins in early November. Grading,
treating and bagging would be performed in late January and February; in
time to deliver the seed to the retail sales points by the March to May plant-
ing dates.
Seed Distribution
4.11      Prior to each crop planting season the APB and the provincial
governments would assist the OSPD determine seed production targets and
estimated demand for each recommended variety. The provincial governments
with their ORD Rural Guidance staff and other agricultural officers, are
fully experienced in contacting farmers for the distribution of seeds and
other farm production inputs (para 2.13). Targets would be set for each
village, market area, county, district and province for the volume of seeds
for each crop to be marketed each crop season. This arrangement produced
and distributed over 40,000 tons of seeds in 1970 and 1971 (para 2.18).
4.12      The OSPD would contract with NACF to serve as its major wholesale
and retail seeds distributor. NACF would receive the pre-packaged seeds
on consignment, arrange for transportation to the wholesale and retail centers,
provide the needed transit storage, sell the seed to the farmer-buyer and
return the amount collected to OSPD less the costs of marketing. During
appraisal, marketing costs were estimated at 5% commission plus the actual
cost of transportation and handling - $8.80 per ton for field crop seeds and
$10.00 per ton for potato (Annex 11). NACF would also provide short-term
production credit if required by the seed purchasers. With about 6,000 retail
farm sales and storage centers and with vast experience in marketing farm in-
puts, commodities and production credit, NACF is eminently qualified to
market Certified seeds. The OSPD would also use private retailers and direct
sales for the distribution of some of the seeds. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that OSPD would confirm arrangements for seed
distribution that would be acceptable to the Bank.
C. The National Seeds Council (NSC)
4.13      The NSC would serve as an advisory agency to the MAF on national
policies regarding the seeds industry. The NSC, as currently organized,
does not adequately represent all of the interests that should be involved
in framing national seeds policy. Its membership would be revised to
include the MAF Vice Minister as Chairman and representation from OSPD,
ORD, APB, NACF, NAPIO, COA, provincial governments and seed marketers.
Standing committees, with technically qualified members, would deal with:
(a) the addition of new seed varieties and the removal of superseded varieties
from the recommended lists; (b) seed marketing standards and practices; and
(c) the import and export of seeds. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that the NSC would be reorganized and activated under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank. The proposed terms of reference are given
in Annex 6.



- 18 -
D. NAPIO and Quality Control
4.14      The NAPIO is responsible for the enforcement of the provisions
relating to quality control in the Seed Law of Staple Crops (Law No. 975)
of January 16, 1962 as amended. It has not been active in the certification
of field crop seeds under the existing program partly because of defects
in the Law. The Seeds Law would be revised to ensure that NAPIO had the
authority to inspect fields of crops produced for seed and seeds in storage
or retail establishments; take samples and test seeds offered for sale,
license and regulate seed dealers; and assure farmers that seeds offered
for sale meet minimum quality standards as labeled (Annex 5). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that (a) the Seeds Law and attendant
regulations would be modified and strengthened within 18 months of Loan
effectiveness under terms acceptable to the Bank; (b) all seeds offered
for sale in the ROK would meet quality standards set by the Seeds Law
and its regulations; and, (c) OSPD would produce and market only seeds of
varieties recommended by NSC and inspected by NAPIO.
E.  Seed Prices and Financial Responsibilities
4.15      During the 30 year estimated life of the project, the OSPD would
recover its costs; i.e. administration and overhead, procurement, processing,
storage, distribution, plant repair and maintenance and loan service charges;
from the sale of seeds.  Its costs for Registered seed and for farm machinery
operations would be recovered from seed growers. Fees paid NAPIO would
cover its investment and operating costs for the certification of project
seeds.  Estimated operating costs are detailed in Annex 11.
4.16      To recover the above costs as estimated at 1972 prices, it would be
necessary to price the field crop Certified seeds to farmers at an average
margin of 65% above and seed potato at 160% above the 1972 crop harvest
prices. In the existing program field crop seeds have been priced at 20%
above grain harvest prices for average quality seeds and as high as 100%
above for Registered seed and seed of new varieties. Seed potato is usually
sold with a margin 100% or more above the harvest price. At these prices,
ROK absorbs a loss of about US$1.0 million per year; US$20.00 per ton of
seed for the payment of seed growers premiums and US$5.00 per ton for seed
promotion activities. With the project all of the seed grower premium costs
and a part of the seed promotion costs would be assumed by the OSPD.
4.17      Korean farmers may not be willing to purchase the available supply
of project seeds at 65% or 160% above harvest prices for the first three
or four years until their higher quality has been proven and accepted.
Pricing seeds at an average mark-up of say 40% for field crops and 120% for
seed potato in the first year of operations (1975 for potato and 1976 for
field crops) and gradually increasing the mark-up to cover all costs by
1979 would be acceptable. Losses accruing during this time would be less
than US$1.0 million and would be met from OSPD's annual budget.  ROK and
the respective provinces would transfer their support from the existing seeds



- 19 -
program to OSPD and the other participating agencies; the existing program
of providing Registered seed to village seed growers would be discontinued.
During negotiations assurances were obtained on these matters.
4.18      However, during the 30-year life of the project, OSPD's operating
costs would be sensitive to harvest prices, premium arrangements contracted
with the FLIA Certified Seed growers, deviations from the projected volumes
and other factors. Accordingly, seed prices as calculated above may not be
the appropriate prices to charge farmer-users of the OSPD Certified seeds.
OSPD would determine the sales price for each type of seed each year to
reflect changes in costs, the value of crop yield responses obtained from
the use of Certified seeds, the introduction of new varieties, competitive
prices and reliability of seeds available from other sources and other
market factors. As a general rule, OSPD would be responsible for setting
the retail prices for its seeds. However, for national policy reasons
the ROK may decide to regulate these prices at levels below costs. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from ROK that: (a) the OSPD would
initiate and continue operational research studies designed to (i) evaluate
demand for each type and variety of seed to be produced each year; (ii) cal-
culate costs; and (iii) determine seed prices that would be sufficient to
recover all costs including plant replacement and loan servicing charges
during the life of the project; and (b) to the extent that ROK regulates
seed prices at below costs, ROK would reimburse the OSPD Revolving Fund
as needed.
F. Accounts and Audits
4.19      Separate accounts would be established and maintained to cover
each part of the project investment and operations. OSPD's accounts would
be maintained so as to reflect in accordance with sound commercial
accounting practices, its operations and financial conditions. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that (a) each separate account would be
maintained as indicated above and audited annually by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank; and (b) copies of the audit reports would be sent
to the Bank within four months after the close of each fiscal year.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      Economic Benefits:  At full development, Certified seeds marketed
would be sufficient to sow about 300,000 ha of paddy, 40,000 ha of regular
barley and 40,000 ha of naked barley, 18,000 ha of wheat, 9,000 ha of
soybeans and 11,000 ha of potato. Estimated increased yields due to
improved seeds, based on ORD research, would be 6% for paddy, 12% for
barley and wheat, 10% for soybeans and 50% for potato. The value of this
increase when priced at estimated 1980 world market prices would provide
a national gross incremental annual income of about US$14.0 million
(Won 5,600 million). After deducting the investment costs (exclusive of



- 20 -
price contingencies) and the operating costs, the economic rate of return
would be about 48%, without potato the ERR is 37%. If the estimated
increased yield were reduced by half, the rate of return would be about
23%. A 15% higher cost and a 25% lower sales volume provides an ERR of
33%.
5.02      The saving in foreign exchange that would result from the
substitution of the increased grain, oilseed and potato production for
equivalent imports of these items would be the import cost of 80,000 tons
of foodgrains, 7,500 tons of oilseeds and 60,000 tons of potato valued
at about US$14.0 million annually. The project would have a minimal direct
employment effect.
5.03      Financial Benefits:  The estimated net incremental farm income
per ha accruing to farmer-users of Certified seed in the year the seed is
used would be about US$45 for paddy, US$29 for regular barley, US$34 for
naked barley, US$25 for wheat, US$9 for soybean and US$250 for potato.
These direct benefits would accrue to at least 500,000 farm families,
about one-fifth of the farmers in Korea. More than 400,000 ha of land
would be planted with the new seeds each year. Without seed renewal,
benefits would continue at a decreasing rate for the next three to five
years except for potato which requires new seed each year. FLIA members
growing Certified seed for OSPD would receive higher net farm incomes
because of the supervision and seed grower premiums provided by the OSPD.
However, these benefits would be limited to about 5,000 farmers and the
77,000 ha of land needed to produce the seed.
5.04      Ecology:  It is unlikely that the project would significantly
alter the ecology of the area. In Korea, field crops and potato are
generally protected from pests and diseases by chemical sprays. With the
project, there would be very little, if any, change in the rate of application.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  The Seed Law for Staple Crops (Law No. 975) would be
amended and regulations modified to establish the OSPD
within 12 months from the date of loan effectiveness.
No disbursement would be made, except for consultants,
until the above conditions had been fulfilled; the Chief
Executive Officer posted would be acceptable to the Bank;
and the Chief Executive Officer and each of the administrative
divisional officers and plant managers as specified in the
staffing plan would be employed under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank (para 4.02);
.



- 21 -
(b) OSPD would be financed adequately with annual appropriations
for operating expenses and a Revolving Fund equal to or
greater than the cost of seed procurement (para 4.04);
(c) The OSPD would initiate and continue operational research
studies designed to evaluate demand for each type and
variety of seed to be procured each year, calculate costs
and determine seed prices that would recover all costs
including plant replacement and loan service charges
(para 4.18); and
(d) The Seeds Law and its regulations would be revised to
strengthen the NSC and NAPIO (paras 4.13 and4.14).
6.02      A condition of loan effectiveness would be that arrangement
acceptable to the Bank had been completed with USAID for the financing of
additional crops research for ORD.
6.03      The project is suitable for a loan of US$7.0 million under
standard Bank terms.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
AGRICULTURE AND THE ECONOMY
General
1.        Agriculture plays a major role in the economy of Korea.  It employs
almost half of the total labor force, accounts for nearly 30% of GNP, and
provides raw materials for a large share of Korea's dynamic industrial sec-
tor. Agriculture's importance in the economy as measured by its share of
total employment, GNP, and total exports has declined in the last decade.
Agricultural production has not kept pace with growing market requirements,
especially for food grains, causing the trade deficit for agricultural pro-
ducts to rise from US$64 million in 1961 to US$362 million in 1971. Income
gains of rural people have lagged far behind those of urban people.  Despite
a large migration from rural to urban areas, real incomes of farm households
increased about 60% from 1961 to 1971 while those of urban households more
than doubled.
2.        During the first and second five-year plan periods (1962-1966 and
1967-71), rapid industrial growth was the major objective of Korea's develop-
ment strategy and the urban industrial sector absorbed the lion's share of
investment resources. Manufacturing output rose 20% annually and industrial
exports 40% annually. Output of the agricultural sector, including forestry
and fishery, which received only about 6% of total public investment during
the first two plan periods increased 4% annually. Korea now has decided to
put greater emphasis on agriculture and rural development. Major objectives
of the new development strategy are: (a) to achieve a more equitable income
distribution and improve rural infrastructure to meet social needs, (b) to
accelerate expansion in food grain production and in particular attain great-
er self-sufficiency in rice production, and (c) to conserve and develop land
and water resources to build up the resource base for expanding agricultural
output in the future.
3.        Nearly 70% of the land area is hilly or mountainous.  Cultivated
land, about 23% of the total, is located mainly in river valleys and along
the western and southwestern coasts.  Temperatures limit the growing of
winter crops in the northern part of the country but not in the south. Rain-
fall averages between 1,000 and 1,250 mm a year, but over half falls during
June to September. Rainfall fluctuates widely from year to year causing
severe flood damage in some years and water shortages for irrigation and
seed production in others. See IBRD Map 10376.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        Korea has only .07 ha of cultivated land per person.  As shown
below, almost 60% of the 1971 cultivated area was in paddy. Other crops
include barley, wheat, maize, forage, fruits and vegetables and potato.

Total                             9.9                  .31
The crop area, production and yield data by provinces are given in Table 1.
5.        Major constraints to expanding crop production include low native
fertility and high acidity of soils which therefore require large applications
of fertilizer and lime to be productive, highly variable rainfall which
often causes water shortages during rice planting periods in June and flood
damage from August to October and poorly developed irrigation and drainage
facilities which together with low temperatures prevent double cropping of
much cultivated land.  However, Korea has nearly one million hectares of
sloping land that could be developed for orchards, pasture, upland crops
and forestry production.
6.        Nearly 15 million people, almost half of the nation's total, live
in about 35,000 rural villages. There are 2.5 million farm households.
Land holdings per household are small and highly fragmented. They averaged
only 0.9 ha per household in 1970, including 0.5 ha of paddy land and 0.4
ha of dry fields. Each farm household usually has land in several small
plots at different locations which makes mechanization difficult. As a
result of land reform carried out after World War II, almost all farm land
now is owner operated. Farm households receive about 20% of their income
from off-farm employment. There has been little change in total farm
population or in the average size of land holdings in the last decade.
However, about 4.5 million people have moved from rural to urban areas
since 1961, a number equal to about one-third of the urban population in
1971. As a result, urban population almost doubled in the last decade.
Population growth declined from 2.5% annually in the early 1960s to 1.8%
in 1971.
7.        Korea's overall agricultural output grew at a rate of 3.5%
annually during 1961-71. Total crop production increased 3.4% annually;
the planted area increased about 1% annually and crop output per hectare
2.4%. Production of fruit, vegetables, and industrial crops more than
doubled as both yields per hectare and planted areas of these crops in-
creased greatly. However, rice production which accounts for almost half



ANNEX I
Page 3
of the total value of crop production increased only about 2.6% annually.
There has been little change in the planted area of rice and other food
grains. New land developed for paddy has been offset by reduction in paddy
land due to expansion of cities, highways and industries. Total cultivated
area increased about 240,000 ha (12%) in the last decade mainly by bringing
additional upland under cultivation. Cropping intensity has averaged about
150% annually and has not changed in the last decade.
8.        It is mostly in relation to growing domestic demand for food
grains and livestock products that agriculture's production performance can
be considered inadequate. By contrast, fruit, vegetables, and fishery ex-
ports have increased. Imports of rice, wheat and barley increased to 2.7
million metric tons in 1971 (about 45% of local production) compared with
only 500,000 to 600,000 tons in the early 1960s. Rising food and feed grain
imports are mainly responsible for Korea's growing trade deficit in agri-
cultural products. Export earnings from fruit, vegetable, fishery and other
agricultural products increased to US$85 million in 1971. This growth was
not enough to offset the rise in agricultural imports from US$44 million in
1961 to US$414 million in 1971.
9.        Capital Inputs:  The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation
(NACF), a semi-autonomous government agency, has a monopoly on the sale of
fertilizer but private firms in addition to NACF sell other inputs and carry
out marketing functions.  Korea maintains low prices for fertilizer and
subsidizes purchases of farm machinery. Fertilizer prices paid by farmers
have not increased since 1965 and now cover only 40% of the cost of manufac-
ture and delivery. Fertilizer production as well as use by farmers has been
subsidized. Fertilizer use increased from 308,000 metric tons (plant
nutrients) in 1961 to over 600,000 tons in 1971. The number of power
tillers increased from only 30 in 1961 to over 17,000 in 1971. There also
have been large increases in numbers of power sprayers, threshers, and other
farm machines. Use of fungicides, insecticides, herbicides and other chemicals
to control insect pests and diseases increased from 5,000 tons in 1961 to
over 17,000 in 1971.
10.       Land and Water Development:  The Agricultural Development
Corporation (ADC) is chiefly responsible for carrying out irrigation
projects. Because of the extreme shortage of land suitable for cultivation
and possibilities of increasing crop production by improving irrigation,
drainage and flood control facilities the Government has made large invest-
ments for land and water development. Government investments for water
development averaged between 2 and 3 billion Won annually during 1965-68
and increased to 18 billion in 1969 and 14 billion in 1970. About two-
thirds of the paddy, barley and wheat lands are irrigated.
11.       Price Supports:  Government price support programs for barley,
soybeans, maize and other crops have been carried out by the MAF to
encourage output expansion and to improve farm incomes. Producer prices
for rice and other grains were near those at which imports were available
in 1965, but the government support price for rice was raised each year
until it reached US$242 per metric ton in 1972, about 50% above the import
price of US$166 a ton. Producer support prices for polished barley have



ANNEX 1
Page 4
been at 67% of those for rice, but the retail price of barley has been
maintained at 50% of that for rice in order to encourage consumption
substitution of barley for rice. Livestock product prices also have been
maintained at high levels to encourage increased production. Imports of
livestock products were restricted beginning in July 1972. Consequently,
price relationships among farm products generally are similar to those in
world markets except that prices of most fruits and vegetables are relatively
low. Real incomes per farm household have increased since 1965 largely as
the result of hIgher farm product prices.  However, rice production has not
increased significantly indicating that other measures such as improved
water management, new high yielding varieties, and better disease and pest
control practices may be required to expand rice production. But a
significant increase in production of other grains, 33% from 1961 to 1971,
was achieved.
12.       Agricultural Credit:  The government sponsored cooperative system,
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF), is the main source of
institutional credit. Interest rates for NACF credit range from 3.5% for
long term irrigation loans to 15.5% for certain kinds of medium term produc-
tion and facility loans. The largest volume of loans is at 9%. These rates
may be compared with Korean Development Bank industrial loans ranging from
7.5 to 16.5% and commercial bank rates mainly in the 6 to 15.5% range.
Farmers get most of their credit from non-institutional sources at rates of
4 to 6% per month.  Loans available in the cooperative system from the
government budget and from its own banking operations fall far short of                   _
meeting the demand at the terms offered so rationing of available credit by
NACF is necessary. There are no good estimates of aggregate credit needs of
farmers, but lack of credit has not retarded growth in the use of fertilizers
or pesticides. However, lack of intermediate term credit probably has
retarded mechanization and expansion of livestock production. It is
reported that 80% of the loan applications made by farmers to NACF to help
finance the use of farm machinery in 1972 had to be rejected because of lack
of government loan funds.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF)
13.       The MAF effectively supervises all agricultural services in the
country. Each provincial government has an Agriculture and Forestry Bureau
which administers MAF functions in the province. The MAP is concerned with
overall policy formulation, budgeting, programming and coordination. It
recommends appointments to senior provincial administrative positions at the
central and gun (county) levels, but the rest of agricultural staffing and
the day-to-day administration of all officers and activities within the
province is the responsibility of the provincial administration.
Agricultural Extension
14.       Agricultural extension work in Korea is highly developed.  It is
elaborate and well coordinated.  Technical guidance and training is given by
the Office of Rural Development (ORD) which disseminates the results of its              S
research through about 75 workers of ORD, 260 workers at the Provincial
Offices of Rural Development (PORD), about 6,500 Rural Guidance workers in the



ANNEX 1
Page 5
1972 guns (county) and 15,000 agricultural workers and farmer leaders. The
agriculture and forestry sector workers located at the gun and myon (sub-
county) levels are responsible for implementing the programs of MAF, which
are channelled through the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of the provincial
government.
15.       County Extension Setup:  The gun administrative chief in
consultation with his agricultural sector workers and Rural Guidance
Officers prepares detailed breakdown of MAF and provincial government
programs for myons, ri or dongs (Group of 2-4 villages) and villages
within the gun. To illustrate the organizational set up for implementation
of agricultural programs in a gun the position in Hampyong gun of the Cholla
Nam province may be examined. This Hampyong gun with a total area of 385
sq km is one of 22 guns in the Cholla Nam province. It has 9 myongs, 104
dong and ri and 478 villages. There are 19,500 farm households cultivating
about 17,500 ha. There are altogether 150 workers who are concerned with
agricultural extension work in one way or another giving an average coverage
of 130 farm households or 120 ha per worker. This includes 33 Rural Guidance
Officers and 22 agricultural and forestry sector workers at the gun level,
54 agricultural and forestry sector extension workers at the myon level and
51 leaders of Prosperity Zones who receive some salary from government. In
addition, each dong or ri leader has one trained farmer each for seeds,
fungicide, insecticide, fertilizer, and irrigation and drainage. The gun
administrative chief directs and coordinates the activities of these
workers, who may be assigned either on functional or regional basis. A
typical Organization Chart for a province is attached.
16.       Cooperative Rice Production Zones:  As a means of increasing
rice production, a cooperative system was introduced since 1968. Under
this system, farmers are organized into cooperative zones covering 5 to
15 ha and urged to use the same paddy variety and the same cultural
technology, fertilizer application and insect and disease control methods.
Leaders are specifically selected, a farmers council is designated in each
area, training sessions of farmers are activated during the winter months,
and pamphlets and cultivation calendars are printed and distributed to all
the farm households. This system was used to increase the area under Tongil
paddy (IR-667) from nothing to 200,000 ha in 1972. Over 640,000 farmers
were organized into 20,000 cooperative paddy production zones and given
training by Rural Guidance Officers with supporting pamplets and cultivation
calendars. The effectiveness of this system is evidenced by the success of
the Tongil paddy program.
17.       Cooperative System for Inputs, Credit and Market:  Again, the
distribution of almost all supplies of inputs and credit originating from
Government resources are managed through the cooperative system which also
handles marketing of a number of crops. About 90% of Korean farmers are
members of cooperatives. The dong-ri cooperatives which may cover from 2
to 5 villages are primary societies grouped into gun agricultural cooperative
federations, and successively into provincial and the National Agricultural
Cooperative Federation (NACF).



ANNEX 1
Page 6
18.       Package Approach:   The development program for increased production
of crops particularly in respect of the use of recommended seeds and other
inputs is planned and implemented as a package approach. The Agricultural
Extension Service is well coordinated with other programs that make available
the necessary inputs. Accordingly, the mission is satisfied that the Agri-
cultural Extension and Cooperative systems in Korea are adequate to promote
the production, distribution and utilization of improved agricultural inputs.
They would be used to determine demand for and distribute seeds by the pro-
posed project.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
THE EXISTING SEEDS INDUSTRY
1.        The MAF through APB, ORD and the provincial governments has organized
and operated a large scale public sector seeds production and distribution
industry for cereal crops, soybeans and potato for several years.  A National
Seeds Council, with representation from the MAF, ORD and the Colleges of
Agriculture, recommends the varieties to be propagated and seed production
targets for each province. The system is designed to enable farmers to renew
their seed from official sources every third year for paddy, barley, wheat
and potato and every sixth year for soybeans.
2.        ORD multiplies the Breeder and Foundation seeds of these varieties
and provides Foundation seeds to the provincial seed farms (PORD). The next
stage, Registered seed, is produced on the PORD seed farms and distributed by
the respective provincial governments to many thousands of selected seed
growers in selected villages for reproduction as "Certified" seed. Typically,
the provincial government's county and village staff are allocated target
areas and quantities of seed to produce. A small group of progressive farmers
with adjacent lands are organized into a Prosperity Zone (PZ) group. The
Registered seed stock together with fertilizers, plant protection services and
field rogueing services are provided this group in an attempt to maximize
output and maintain quality. Each PZ seed-grower farmer harvests his crop
and, on demand, "spontaneously" exchanges his seed for commercial grain with
other farmers. The PZ seed growers receive an incentive payment from govern-
ment, usually at 20% above the market price of the grain at harvest. In
addition, the seed grower may negotiate a premium price from his customers.
Prices up to 100% above harvest prices were reported for the new Tongil paddy
variety.
3.        Seed production under the system for 1969-71 was estimated as
follows:

4.        Arrangements and procedures for the production of Breeder seed
are under the control of the plant breeders located at Suweon or at one of
the Regional ORD Crop Experiment Stations at Honan and Milyang for field crops
and at Alpine for potato. For paddy, ear rows are transplanted, with only
rows true to the plant type being bulked and harvested for seed. Similar
procedures are followed at the PORD seed farms where the the Foundation and
Registered seeds are produced. In most cases, atypical plants are destroyed
before harvest. The plant breeder usually inspects the crop and determines
if it meets his standards.
5.        The PORD seed farms, inspected by the mission at each proposed
plant site, appeared to be under adequate managerial control and adapted for
the purpose of producing seed stock. They were provided with vermin-proof
storage buildings and farm machinery, seed threshing, cleaning and drying
equipment. However, most of these farms needed additional equipment for
the purpose of producing Registered seed under the project. The PORD seed
farm areas available for the production of Foundation and Breeder seeds are
as follows:

6.        Provision for the supervision and quality control of Foundation
and Registered seed production by the National Seeds Council is clearly
adequate and the genetic quality of each variety is maintained, although
admixtures after harvest is possible. No grow-on trials are undertaken to
check quality. The seed is tested for purity and germination at poorly equipped
ORD Experiment Station seed laboratories. NAPIO does not inspect the crop
in the field, nor process seed samples in its laboratory.
7.        The PZ selected farmers who receive Registered seed from the PORD
farm, multiply this seed into "certified" seed under the supervision of the
PORD Rural Guidance Officer (PRGO). Fields may or may not be rogued to remove
a typical plants, other crops and weeds. The farmer who is responsible



ANNEX 2
Page  3
for harvesting, drying, cleaning, packaging and distribution uses traditional
methods; the same way he prepares commercial grain for marketing. There is
no field inspection for paddy and only limited laboratory testing for purity
and germination by NAPIO or any other agency. The provincial government staff
interviewed by the mission considered the NAPIO standards to be unrealistically
high and inflexible. Neither NAPIO, nor the provincial agricultural agencies
have the trained staff, ability or equipment needed to classify the PZ produced
seeds as to quality.
8.        The failure to use appropriate methods for maintaining species and
varietal purity in the PZ seed grower scattered fields and for harvesting,
threshing, drying, processing, storage, treating for seed borne diseases and
packaging results in seeds with variable quality and low yield improving
potential. As a result, farmers have not demanded the PZ "certified" seed.
A considerable proportion of the production has been used for food con-,
sumption rather than seed.
9.        Deficiencies of the existing system which the proposed project
would be designed to correct include the following:
(a) The PORD seed farms, under the control of the provincial
governments are also used to produce varieties not recom-
mended by the MAF-NSC. These ad hoc varieties have a low
demand from farmers, contribute to the varietal mixture
problem and fail to increase crop yield. With the project,
only varieties recommended by the MAF would be multiplied
as Foundation and Registered seed on the PORD seed farms.
(b) Purity and high germination cannot be assured when seed
production areas are small, scattered, lack technical
supervision and use traditional methods for harvesting,
threshing, drying, storage and packaging. The proposed
project would provide for a concentrated system of seed
production under the supervision of technically competent
staff, equipped with modern facilities for production,
harvesting, threshing, drying, storage, cleaning, treating,
packaging and distribution of seeds meeting Certification
standards. NAPIO would have full responsibility for field
and seed inspection, appropriate labeling and compliance
with the Seeds Law and its regulations.
(c) Seed borne diseases are not identified and controlled. All
seeds produced and marketed by the KNSC would meet acceptable
*                     standards for seed borne diseases.
(d) The existing program provides for a modest input of new
varieties as developed by the COA and ORD plant breeders.
The proposed project's parallel financing by USAID would
strengthen ORC in an attempt to increase the flow of improved
0                  higher yielding varieties.  The project provides the means
for a more rapid multiplication and distribution of the
recommended varieties.

(e) Over all direct recurrent costs to the MAF and provincial
governments for the existing seed program exceeds US$1.0 mil-
lion per year or about US$25.00 per ton of seed targeted.
None of this expenditure is recovered by government from
seed buyers. The proposed project at full development would
be self-sufficient and recover all costs of operation
including loan servicing.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
THE OFFICE FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT (ORD)
A. General
1.        The ORD Research Bureau has the responsibility for varietal
improvement research in field crops, i.e. paddy, barley, wheat, maize,
oilseeds, forage and pasture crops and potato. A program coordination
office is located at Seoul in the MAF. The main research center in all
crops other than potato is located at the Suweon Crop Experiment Station
in Korea's northern ecological zone. An important role is played, notably
in paddy, barley and wheat improvement, by the Honam Station in the central
ecological zone, and by the Milyang station in the south ecological zone.
Potato research is performed at the Alpine Experiment Station. Provincial
Offices of Rural Development located in each province conduct adaptive
and associated cultural research at the PORD research seed farms and adaptation
trials on farmers' fields throughout the country.  ORD encompasses a Program
Coordination Office and the Bureau for Research and Rural Guidance which
are situated in Seoul. In addition research institutes are located as fol-
lows:
-    Veterinary Research Laboratory - Anjang
-    Institute of Plant Environment - Suweon
-    Crops Experiment Station - Suweon
-    Horticulture Experiment Station - Suweon
-    Sericulture Experiment Station - Suweon
-    Livestock Experiment Station - Suweon
-    Honam Crops Experiment Station
-    Jeju Experiment Station
-    Alpine Experiment Station - Gang Neung
-    Yungnam Crops Experiment Station
2.        Staff:  In 1972, the ORD staffing was as follows:
ORD    PORD     RGO     Total
Administrative Officers        105     115       -       222
Research Workers               493     307       -       800
Guidance Workers - Extension   73      256    5,759   6,088
Miscellaneous Services         118     167       -       285
e                       Total                     791      845            7, 395



ANNEX 3
Page 2
3.        Paddy research is by far the most active and strongly supported
program, though there has been considerable recent advance in other programs
and further intensification is planned. The physical facilities provided,
especially for paddy, are generally good. Paddy breeders can handle up to
three generations of breeding material every year. Scientists assigned to
crop breeding are as follows: paddy, 27; barley and wheat, 12; oilseeds,
3; maize, 2; potato, 3; and forage crops, 2.
4.        Research programs are handicapped by inadequate staffing - both
in numbers and standards - and by inappropriate organization. Breeders
engaged in crop improvement lack the support of essential related dis-
ciplines - notably pathology, entomology, and cereal chemistry. The more
basic breeding work in paddy, barley, wheat and soybean is conducted at
Suweon with the other centers working on more specific problems, e.g.,
resistance in paddy to brown hopper concentrated at Honam and resistance
to dwarf virus at Milyang. It should be noted that in the College of Agri-
culture - Suweon National University (COA/SNU) - the Department of Crop
Science (2 PhDs and 2 MS) paddy improvement program is supported by well
staffed departments of pathology, entomology and physiology all of which
are involved in plant breeding. There is a weak relationship with ORD
due to lack of coordination, though there is temporary use of COA/SNU
breeders as was seen in the development of the new Tongil variety.
5.        Paddy:  Paddy crop improvement research in ROK followed this
pattern:
-    1907 - mid 1940s  -  introduction of varieties from Japan;
potential yields were raised by 3.3 to 5.0
tons paddy per ha. New introductions
dominated rice area in a ratio of about 3:1.
-    1947                  Establishment of Institute of Agriculture
Improvement at Suweon.
-    1962                  Institute incorporated into ORD.
-    1968                  ORD in association with COA/SNU had developed
21 recommended varieties that had been tested
through a network of regional and provincial
experiment farms, and farmer field sites and
with a potential yield of 6.5 tons/ha.
They are sown on 65% of the area planted in
paddy.
-    1965                  Breeding program started in collaboration with
cr=- ~~~~IRR5LiTItheTPhi1Ippipres to- a-e-
and Indica cross.  IR 667 - Tongil was the out-
come which has a potential yield of 8.3 tons/ha.
0



ANNEX 3
Page  3
6.        Three generations can be produced per years with line selections
from P3 being given preliminary yield trials for two years, followed by two
years of advanced yield trials including agronomic testing. Up to this
stage all work is supervised by plant breeders and retained at the three
experiment stations.  The breeding program is now making considerable progress
in developing new IR 667 related lines by back-crossing to standard Korean
varieties aimed at correcting Tongil's deficiencies, e.g. susceptibility to
cold and insect attack.  Results of this work are expected to emerge in 1974/75.
The new variety would be multiplied and distributed by the proposed project.
7.        A special seeds program to multiply Tongil resulted in 12,500 tons
being produced and distributed in 1972. The success of this program was
assured by the considerable administrative and extension effort by ORD and
special incentives to selected seed growers. The farmers interest in the
variety created by widespread publicity was such that premiums of up to 100%
were paid for "pre-general release" seed. Farmers planted over 200,000 ha
or about 20% of the paddy area with this variety.
8.        In 1972, the MAF recommended six varieties of paddy as listed below:
Nongback (released 1969); Jinheung (1962); Man Kyung (1969); Palkweng (1964);
Akibore (1971); Tongil (1971). These varieties cover the full ecological
adaptation range and an adequate maturity range. All varieties, except
Tongil, have yield potentials for paddy of around 6.5 tons/ha.  Tongil,
*       developed by the COA, has produced average yields of 7.0 to 10.0 tons/ha in
trials on almost 5,000 farms throughout the country.
9.        Barley and Wheat:  Current emphasis in ROK is on double cropping
patterns to intensify agricultural production. The main need is for early
maturing high yielding varieties together with disease resistance and
acceptable grain size and milling quality. For example, winter barley and
wheat are sown after paddy harvest in October and harvested before paddy is
transplanted the following June. Since paddy is the most profitable crop,
the highest standards of husbandry are accorded it; therefore, barley and
wheat crops must be harvested by mid-June. This problem is less important
in the southern regions where farmers have a larger growing season in which
to operate.
10.       Plant improvement work on barley and wheat started around 1909 with
local varieties then having yield potential of around 2.4 tons/ha. Potential
productivity levels of the best improved varieties have been raised to
6.2 tons/ha for regular barley, 5.0 tons/ha for naked barley and 4.7 tons/ha
for wheat. These improved varieties account for 40 to 60% of the sown areas.
In the naked form the grain is huskless (the caryopsis is without lemma or
palea), it is grown mainly in the central and southern parts of ROK.
11.       Breeding work is undertaken at the three regional experiment
stations with Kwangju (branch station of Honam) being responsible for work
on naked barley. Plant improvement is attempted by crossing selections
*       from spring wheat to introduce earliness in winter wheat and in the case of
barley and wheat to incorporate desirable characteristics from within existing
germ plasm in ROK and from geographically remote areas e.g. from Europe. There



ANNEX 3
Page  4
are three recommended varieties of regular and two of naked barley, most of
which are old introductions. Korean releases since 1965 occupied something
less than 20% of the total area cropped to barley in 1971. However, breeding
research has developed a new barley variety which matures 5 days earlier and
has a yield increase of 15 to 20% over other varieties.  It is adapted to
paddy land as a double crop. It would probably be available for seed mul-
tiplication by 1975. For wheat, two varieties are recommended.
12.       Soybean:  In 1913, potential yield levels were around 1 ton/ha.
Crop improvement work started then showed no real improvement until the
1960s when the use of introduced varieties raised potential yields to
around 1.6 tons/ha. Locally developed new varieties raised this to around
2.1 tons/ha and in 1970, 55% of the national soybean area was sown to new
varieties. There are 13 recommended varieties. Breeding policy is to
improve existing varieties with regard to oil and protein content, disease
and insect resistance, and improved growth characteristics.
13.       Potato:  Local varieties have been grown in Korea for a long
time. The first foreign introduction, Nankok from Germany, was in 1920.
From 1945-1960, a number of new varieties from the U.S.A. were introduced,
including Irish Cobbler, which is now grown on 80% of the potato cultivated
area. A breeding program was started in 1965 using characteristics in wild
varieties on existing material to produce early maturity, high yield, disease
resistance and high starch content.  From 1965 to 1971, 98 hybrids have been
tested and nine promising lines are undergoing yield and agronomic trials.
The breeding work is carried out on the Alpine Research Station in Gang Weon
province where Foundation seed is produced. Current yield potential is
15 tons/ha whereas breeding targets plan to achieve 20 tons/ha. Lines from
Irish Cobbler crossed with Mary Baker look favorable for release around 1975
and 1976. A number of other promising lines are undergoing tests.
14.       Crop Breeding Problem.  The overall breeding program is dominated
by the necessity to find varieties that fit the dominant climatic factors
shown diagramatically in Figure 1. The main problems are listed as the
need to:
(a) develop cold tolerance in barley and wheat against the
possibility of damage during germination and early growth
from below-average cold conditions throughout the winter;
(b)  develop resistance against disease patterns favored by high
temperature and high humidity during heading of wheat and
barley in May when rainfall is heavy;
(c) seek early maturity in wheat and barley so that:
(i) harvesting and associated operations in June will
not be overly affected by above average rainfalls, and
(ii)  peak labor demands due to the need for rapid turnaround
of crops when double cropping with paddy, soybean and
other crops are reduced;



ANNEX 3
Page 5
(d) develop delayed flowering in the paddy crop so that it con-
tinues to grow vegetatively during the main rainy period of
July and August and yet matures sufficiently rapidly
afterwards to avoid cold damage from rapid temperature drops
experienced in late September and early October;
(e) develop new higher yielding varieties of potato which are
faster in the tuber setting and more vigorous under low
temperatures at the early growing stage; and
(f) breed for disease resistance in all crops, particularly virus
in potato.
B. The National Seeds Council (NSC)
15.       The NSC includes representatives from MAF, ORD, (6) the NAPIO
(1) the COAs (6) and the Vice Minister, acting as chairman. Recommendations
for new varieties to be included on the MAF list for seed multiplication
are made by a joint conference (meeting three times annually) composed of the
technical staff of MAF, ORD, the three Crop Experiment Station directors,
the PORD farm directors and COA professors. This conference evaluates the
results of regional trials carried out on line selections at over 70 sites
for paddy and 47 sites for barley and recommends the best varieties to the
NSC which in turn advises the Ministry. Approval of a variety by the MAF
indicates that seed of that variety will be multiplied by ORD to Foundation
Seed and by PORD farms to Registered Seed.
C. USAID Support in Crop Research
16.       The ROK is negotiating a project for ORD, with USAID assistance,
in the financing of crop research. The project, in its formative stage
during appraisal, would strengthen the on-going ORD work by providing
additional technical assistance, equipment and facilities for an intensive
research program of crop breeding and cultural practices that would con-
tribute to the solution of the major problems given in para 14 above. About
75 man-years of expatriate assistance of a team of plant breeders, pathologist,
entomologist, agronomist, agricultural engineers and farm management economist
would join the ORD scientists. The work would be concentrated on cereal
grains, soybeans, potato and forages through FY 78 and with a possible renewal
of aid as a part of a long-range development plan for Korean agriculture.
17.       The type of research planned is an essential supporting element
of the proposed seeds project. If the above arrangements fail to materialize,
this project would need to be restructured to include crop research.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. General
1.        The project would assist ROK finance the installation of five
seed processing plants and storage facilities for field crops and six
plants for seed potato and strengthen the agencies responsible for crop
research (ORD) and seed quality control (NAPIO). The project would be super-
vised by the MAF. Investment funds provided for seed production, processing
and storage would be provided by the Borrower to the Office for Seed Pro-
duction and Distribution to be created in the MAF to operate these facilities.
Farm machinery would be provided OSPD for operations on the seed production
farms. The seed certification facilities of the National Agricultural
Products Inspection Organization (NAPIO) would be strengthened to enable it
to provide seed quality control services. Technical assistance in seed
production; processing and quality control would be provided for in the Bank
loan. A parallel financing arrangement between ROK and USAID would provide
technical assistance and equipment for crop research. The project would be
completed in five years.
B. Seed Production and Procurement
2.        Seed Plant Locations and Production Targets:  The possibility of
expanding cultivable area in the ROK is extremely limited, any increase in
production must come from multiple cropping and higher yields. Seeds of
high yielding varieties, particularly with respect to paddy, barley, wheat,
soybean and potato are a very important component in achieving increased
output.
3.        To determine the volume and kind of seed to produce and process,
and the number, location, plant capacity and design, the mission made an
extensive tour of the proposed sites identified by the FAO/IBRD/CP report and
by ROK. The criteria used to help resolve these issues included (a) importance
of the crop in the Korean economy, (b) the stage of crop research for the
development of new varieties, (c) probable demand for Certified seed,
(d) crop pattern and transportation resources by provinces, (e) seed quality
control characteristics and (f) availability of crop land and progressive
farmers for the production of Certified seed.
4.        Based on these criteria, field crop seed processing and storage
facilities would be located at Pyeongtaeg, Iri, Hampyeong, Euiseong and



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Milyang.  Six seed potato processing plants were chosen, one at the PORD
seed potato farm at Daegwanryeong and five in nearby production areas; all
above 800 m elevation as a means of controlling virus diseases. See IBRD
Maps 10447 and 10516. At full development, 11,000 tons of paddy, 5,000 tons
of barley, 1,000 tons of wheat, 500 tons of soybeans and 10850 tons of
seed potato would be produced, processed and distributed each year as
Certified seed.  These quantities represent estimates of demand at full
development and would provide the following percentages of national annual
seed requirements: paddy, 23%; barley, 8%; wheat, 12%; soybean, 3%; and
potato, 18%.
5.        Field Crop Seeds:  At each plant site, the OSPD would contract
with a local Farmers Land Improvement Association (FLIA) for the production
of field crop seeds (paddy, regular barley, wheat, naked barley and soybean).
The FLIA is a cooperative organization originally designed to consolidate
land holdings and develop the land for irrigation. After completing the
on-farm land construction work, most FLIAs have continued their operations
as joint-farming cooperatives.   At each proposed site for a field crops
seed processing plant, the mission met with officials and inspected the farm
land of the FLIA proposed for the production of seeds for KNSC. In each
case, some of the FLIA members had gained experience as seed producers under
the existing program and were prepared to participate in the proposed project.
6.        FLIA farms ranged from 600 ha to 6,000 ha in size.  Within each
farm seed production would be concentrated in land units of 20 to 30 ha
"blocks" in which the same variety and uniform dates for all field operations
would be maintained for each type of seed produced.  Not more than three
recommended varieties of any crop would be grown at each FLIA. Registered
seed of the varieties selected would be produced by ORD on the PORD seed
farms and provided to the OSPD for use with the FLIA seed growers. Quality
control procedures as required to produce Certified seed would be performed
under OSPD supervision and NAPIO inspection. OSPD would control harvesting,
threshing and delivery to the seed plant for processing. FLIA seed producers
would receive an incentive price, estimated at 10% to 20% above harvest
market price, for all of their produce that met the Certified seed qualifica-
tion standards.
7.        The estimated land area required and quantity of field seeds to
be produced at each location are as follows:
Paddy       Soybeans           Barley            Wheat

ANNEX 4
Page 3
8.        Seed Potato:  The OSPD would manage the 450 ha PORD seed potato
farm at Daegwanryeong where it would produce about 2,000 tons of Registered
seed each year, with the technical assistance of the ORD Alpine Experiment
Station staff. In addition, the OSPD would contract with FLIA cooperatives
and indidividual farmers for the production of about 10,000 tons of seed
potato that would qualify under NAPIO inspection as Certified seed. About
700 ha of land sown to Registered seed potato would be required each year.
All of this area would be located above 800 m (see IBRD Map # 10376). Be-
cause of the scarcity of cultivable land in the mountainous region the seed
potato processing and storage facilities would be located at five centers
within 10 to 25 km from Daegwanryeong and with 100 to 200 ha of seed
potato at each center.
9.        Farm Machinery Operations:  Tractors and tractor drawn plows, discs,
rotavators, field cultivators, grain drills and combines would be provided to
OSPD for use on hire basis at each seed processing plant. In most cases
the field crops of paddy-barley and soybean-wheat would be produced in a
double crop pattern on the same land. To maximize production of paddy and
soybean seed per unit of land it would be necessary to harvest and thresh
the barley or wheat within 15 days during early June. The land must be
plowed and prepared for transplanting paddy before about June 25. Farmers
with bullock powered equipment and manual labor cannot complete those opera-
tions within the time constraint. In addition, the migration of farm labor
to industry has created a farm labor shortage unless mechanical equipment
is added.  Likewise, for seed potato equipment would be needed to enable
planting early in May-and harvesting before the danger of late October or
early November freezing weather. Farm machinery and seed processing equip-
ment would also be provided to ORD for use at the PORD field crop seed farms
that produce Registered seed for OSPD.
C. Field Crop Seed Processing Plants
10.       Development Strategy:  Two of the expatriate consultants provided
by the project would be posted to OSPD soon after approval by the Bank to
assist OSPD prepare design specifications for tender documents and evaluate
bids for the seed plant equipment and civil works. It is anticipated that
the contract for these plants would be tendered by the end of the first year.
The first of the five plants would be constructed and ready to receive
paddy seed by October of the second year. Construction of the remaining four
plants would be completed with equipment installed in time to receive barley
and wheat seed for processing by June of the third year. These two con-
sultants would also assist OSPD establish a system for operations and manage-
ment and train seed plant operators. During the first two or three years
of plant operations commercial quality seeds would be processed with the
tonnage gradually shifted to Certified seed as OSPD, with the assistance of
NAPIO, learned to improve its operations, and achieve the necessary quality
standards. The projected annual volumes of seed production are given in
Table 1.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
11.       Processing Plant Design Criteria:  The proposed plant design and
operational procedures allow for flexibility essential at peak intake
times, particularly at the critical stage of drying.  Equipment would be
standardized and designed for easy cleandown between varieties and species
and for maintenance.  General specifications and functional uses are
described below. Detailed specifications are given in Annex 9.
12.       Operational Sequence and Timing:  The approximate sequence and
timing of plant operations would be as follows:

13.       Anticipated Field Crop Seed Flow Through Processing Plant:  Likely
average field crop seed losses are estimated as 4% in pre-cleaning and 16%
during drying, storage, fine cleaning and packaging. Therefore, to allow
for subsequent losses in drying and processing, the required field production
and seasonal flow through each plant is obtained by adding 25% to the anti-
cipated seed demand. The highest peak intake expected from the winter-crop
season determines the drying and intake capacity of 50 tons per 10 hour day
for each of two intakes that would be installed at each plant. The storage
capacity is controlled by the summer crop seed targets after allowing for an
extra 25% for small lots and bin interchanges. The details are given below
and diagrammed in the attached Charts.
14.       Threshing and Transport:  Grain would be threshed by self-propelled
combined or mechanical threshers. This equipment would be under the control
of the OSPD management to ensure an even flow of threshed seed to the plant
and to reduce the possibility of admixtures during threshing. Intake of seed
at any one processing plant on a single day would usually be restricted to one
variety, but three varieties could be handled in each season. Mechanically
threshed seed would be placed into clean containers and it and the combined
seed would be emptied into tipping trucks or tractor trailers and transported

to the plant immediately. When harvested the moisture content of paddy and
soybean would usually range between 18 and 20%; barley and wheat between 20
and 22% and may be as high as 24% during rainy weather.
15.       Intake and Precleaning:  Incoming seed would cross a weight bridge
that provides a print out showing gross and tare weights of the seed received.
The lot would then be sampled to provide purity, moisture, germination and
clean seed out-turn information. The estimated clean seed out-turn and dry
weight would be the basis for payment to each contract grower providing
other quality conditions had been fulfilled. Samples would also be drawn
at this point by the NAPIO seed inspection officer to determine the certi-
fication status of the particular seed lot.
16.       After acceptance, seed would be tipped into an intake pit of 5 ton
capacity and would discharge into surge bins of 10 tons capacity via bucket
elevators of 20 tons per hour capacity. The bins would gravity serve a de-
awner, which is included especially for barley and wheat though the same
equipment would help break up trash and polish all seeds. The seed would
move down to a pre-cleaner of 20 ton per hour capacity equipped with an
aspiration leg to separate chaff and light screenings. Use of the pre-cleaner
before drying is essential for the protection of subsequent equipment and
for the prevention of blockage of material flow.
17.       Drying and Storage:  Following pre-cleaning, seed passes directly
to the dryer surge bin and is dried.  Two continuous flow dryers each of
10 ton/hour capacity and operated during peaks on a two shift basis of 10 hour
per shift have been specified for drying to safe holding moisture levels. A
continuous flow dryer system provides a forced flow of heated or ambient
temperature air while the seed is turned and mixed. Regular sampling would
be routine to measure drying effectiveness. Field seed at 18 to 24% moisture
would be dried to a safe holding moisture of about 16% and held for redrying
after the close of the intake season. Usually, at least two passes through
the dryer are required to dry seed from 20 to 24% moisture down to a safe
storage level of 12 to 14%. Between passes the seed is "tempered" in hold-
ing bins from 12 hours to 30 days, depending on moisture content and local
weather conditions. Following a final pass through the drier the seed, at
12 to 14% moisture, would be returned to the storage bins to await fine
cleaning. Heated air temperatures for drying would be no more than 40C.
Each dryer would have an ambient air fan to ensure that the seed is cooled
after drying.
18.       Storage bins would be of steel construction, 80 ton capacity
each, and connected to a forced ventilation system to permit easy control
of seed temperature during storage. Temperature monitoring devices would be
installed in each bin. A special bottom would permit rapid and complete
emptying. Bins would be fed and emptied by horizontal belt conveyors and
would be so designed to allow rapid exchange of seed between bins or the
direct movement from bins to any section of the processing plant, e.g. to
the driers, fine cleaning section, seed treatment and the packaging section.
Storage bins of 20 ton capacity are provided as "working bins" and for small
lots of seed. Space for about 700 tons of flat storage would be provided at
each plant.

19.       Seed Processing Equipment:  Seed cleaning equipment capacities have
been determined on the basis of time available for this operation for each
crop and to allow adequate time for thorough cleaning of bins and equipment
between varieties and species. Seed cleaning would not be carried out when
the drying plant is in full operation as the plant employees would be required
to receive the seed from farmers and operate the driers at that time. All
calculations are based on 24 operating days per month and 10 effective
operating hours per working day. The recommended capacity is rounded to the
nearest 4 ton capacity unit allowing for the maximum standardization of plant
components. Grading equipment would allow for both weight separation and
size grading. Fine cleaners would be equipped with at least four offset
screens, fully adjustable pitch, variable shaker speed and two air separations
with variable fan control. Length grading by indented cylinders or discs would
be necessary for the removal of small and broken grains, weed seeds and seeds
of other species.
20.       Seed Treatment and Packaging:  A semi automatic high speed wet seed
treater and automatic weigher-bagger machine with a capacity of 5 tons per
hour packaged in polyethylene heat-sealed bags would be provided. Cereal
seed would be treated against seed-borne diseases with liquid organo-
mercurial dressing or suitable substitutes. Treatment to control loose
smut should be used as necessary. Fungicides and a differential stain would
be used to show clearly that the seed has been treated with poison. Labels
would be attached as required by NAPIO regulations. Size of bags would relate
to size of fields and demand for seed from small and larger farmers would
entail packaging in a range of sizes between 5 kg and 30 kg.  After packaging          W
small bags would be group packed into appropriate shipping sizes.
21.       Other Facilities:  Each plant would be equipped with (a) a workshop
and tools to carry out regular maintenance and minor repair works; (b) offices
for five to seven persons; and (c) a small seed testing laboratory equipped
to test up to 2,000 samples per year for moisture, species purity and germina-
tion. Laboratory equipment would include seed triers, moisture proof sample
bags, sets of grain sieves, sample dividers, analytical balances, pocket
magnifiers, vitascopes complete with splitters, seed kits and powder, cabinet
germinators, refrigerators and aluminum seed trays; (d) two 5-ton tipping
bulk grain trucks, five tractor trailers, one jeep and two motorcycles;
(e) service buildings to house farm machinery, conference room, dormitories
and lounge facilities. About one ha of land would be required for each plant.
D. Seed Potato Processing and Storage
22.       Grading equipment and storage for 2,000 tons of Registered seed
potato would be provided at the PORD farm and for 10,000 tons of Certified
seed potato at five near-by locations. Construction at the PORD farm and
at one potato storage plant would be completed in time for the October,
1975 harvest, and the remaining four plants by October, 1976.
23.       In planning for seed potato production about 15% was added to
the planned Certified sales target to allow for field grading and storage

losses.  Potatoes would be harvested in late September and October and
rough hand graded over a screen into straw bags and transported to the
storage facility. Incoming potatoes would be weighed and sampled to
provide a grading out-turn which would be used as a basis for payment to
contract growers. Samples would also be drawn to ascertain disease levels
and to determine certification status of the particular seed lot.  After
acceptance, potatoes would be placed in storage in bulk heaps with straw
bag walls to separate seed lots. Storage for about 2,000 tons is provided
at each center. The storage building would be double walled with enclosed
air space for insulation and covered with soil. Potatoes would be stored
until late January and February.
24.       Potatoes - Grading Equipment and Operations:  Fine grading equip-
ment capacities were based on 36 work days of 8 hours each in January and
February. Potatoes would be taken out of bulk store either by hand or a
tractor mounted with a front-end bucket, dry brushed, elevated to an
electrically driven roller grader and hand picking table and finally treated
and placed into 40 kg straw bags and labelled according to the NAPIO regu-
lations. Potatoes not acceptable for seed would be sacked separately and
sold on the commercial market. Specifications for the seed potato grading
equipment are given in Annex 9.
E. Seed Distribution and Marketing
25.       As detailed in Annex 2, the ROK has had vast experience in the
use of its Rural Guidance Officers and other agricultural staff for the
assessment of demand and distribution of agricultural production inputs
including seeds. In this project, the OSPD would determine demand with
the assistance of the MAF and representatives from each provincial government
for seeds of each variety recommended by NSC 12 to 14 months in advance of
planting date - March 1 for paddy, May 1 for soybean, September 10 for barley
and wheat, and February 1 for seed potato. This assessment of demand may be
only a target number or it may be supported by firm orders with downpayment
from farmers. The "lead time" is necessary to assure the production of
Registered seed by the PORD for delivery to the OSPD. The demand assess-
ment would be allocated to each processing plant and would be the basis
of OSPD contract arrangements for seed production with the respective FLIAs.
26.       The NACF with its 6,000 retail farm input supply stores would serve
as the major wholesaler-retailer. Before fine cleaning, treating and
packaging, the OSPD would confer with each provincial government regarding
volumes of seed to be shipped from each plant to the respective wholesale
4        and/or retail stores.  NACF would accept delivery of the seed on consignment
and arrange for its transportation and marketing to farmer
users. Some of the seed would be delivered by NACF to other licensed
private seed dealers and to Rural Guidance Officers for ultimate sale to
users. NACF and other seed dealers would settle their accounts with OSPD
O     as the seed is sold.

27.       Projected sales by plant location to each province are given in
Table 2.
28.       Seeds would be priced at a level that would recover all costs of
OSPD, including operations, maintenance, loan service charges and a reserve
for risk and uncertainty. To recover all costs at full development and
1972 basic prices it is estimated that prices per ton for Certified seeds
would be about as follows: paddy, US$340; regular barley, US$195; naked
barley, US$219; wheat, US$201; soybeans, US$370 and potato, US$192.  These
prices represent a relative mark-up from commercial market prices at
planting season of about 46% for paddy, 70% for barley and wheat, 52% for
soybeans and 109% for potato. In the existing seeds program, the planting
season mark-up has varied from 0 to 40Z. During the first five years of
the project the mark up would be increased to the level where all costs
would be recovered. The existing seeds program costs ROK about US$1.0 million
per year for payment of incentives to seed growers. As the program gradually
shifts operations to the OSPD and full recovery of costs, this expenditure
would be saved.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS INSPECTION OFFICE (NAPIO)
General
1.        The success of the project would depend on the quality of seed
produced. The farmer must be assured that the seed he receives has some
form of guarantee and possesses desirable characteristics for germination,
varietal authenticity, high yield, resistance to disease and pests, lodging,
short maturity period, and non-lodging, acceptable cooking quality. The
proposed Seed Certification Service (S.C.S.) backed by Seeds Legislation
would be designed to win the confidence of farmers in new seeds and new
varieties so as to expand sales and concurrently raise agricultural
production.
2.        The initial factor determining the standard for Certified seed is
the variety purity of the material obtained from the plant breeder. The seed
-is multiplied through at least four generations, under both field and
laboratory control, before being sold to end-user farmers for commercial crop
production. These generations are described as:
-    Breeders Seed:  It would be produced by ORD, COA or other breeders
according to the generally accepted practices for the maintenance of the
variety intended for the production of Certified seed. The breeder is
responsible for maintaining a supply of parental material that preserves the
character of the variety and deciding the number of generations from the
parental material that Breeder seed should be multiplied before releasing to
avoid deterioration of varietal purity.
-    Foundation Seed:  Is the first generation multiplied from Breeder's
seed, and would be produced by ORD under the supervision of the breeder.
-    Registered Seed:  Is the first generation multiplied from Foundation
seed. It would be produced on PORD farms under certification rules.
-    Certified Seed:  Is the first generation multiplied from Registered
seed. It would be produced by FLIA farmers under contractual arrangements
with OSPD and NAPIO certification rules.
3.        The basis for the seeds industry in Korea is a Seeds Law of Staple
Crops - Statute No. 975 of January 16, 1972, with its amendments and regula-
tions. The term "seed" would cover vegetative parts and organs used or



ANNEX 5
Page 2

intended for multiplication. Existing statutes and decrees are inadequate
for the purposes of the project and would be revised, consolidated and amended
to provide for the following:
(a) to assure farmers that seed offered for sale meets
minimium quality standards as labelled;
(b)  to prevent misrepresentation and fraud in the sale of seed;
(c) to authorize the Minister of Agriculture to sample, inspect,
analyse and test all "seeds" as defined, sold or offered for
sale within ROK;
(d) to authorize the Minister of Agriculture to introduce a Seed
Certification Scheme;
(e) to designate the organization to be responsible for the
administration of the Seed Certification Scheme;
(f) to provide for the establishment of a Seeds Law enforcement
section with laboratory facilities;
(g) to authorize the seizure and destruction of seed where the
owner or custodian has failed to comply with the provisions
of the Seeds Act;
(h) to provide a method of appeal against orders issued by the
Minister of Agriculture;
5i) to provide for disclaimer or non-warranty clauses on invoices,
advertising or labeling of any seed covered by the Law;
(j) to provide penalties for the violation of the provision of the
Law and for the rules and regulations set up under the Seeds
Law.
4.        The MAF would authorize the creation of an administrative body,
the Seed Certification Service (SCS) as a division of NAPIO to be responsible
for all aspects of seed control such as variety listing, seed certification,
control of seed importation and seed exports, Seed Law enforcement, laboratory
and field testing.
5.        Technical details of the Seed Law would be covered by regulations
which would be drafted in such a way that ROK could participate in the
different seed schemes of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, apply for membership in the International Seed Testing Associa-
tion and adopt the principles of the International Convention for the Protec-
tion of New Plant Varieties. The regulations would cover technical details
regarding: (a) the creation of the SCS; (b) the establishment of a list of



ANNEX 5
Page 3
Recommended Varieties; (c) Seed Certification; and (d) Seed Import and Export.
The rules concerning arbitration, violations and punishments would be
prepared by legal advisors in line with other laws dealing with economic
matters.
Seed Certification Service
6.        The SCS would comprise three sections:
(a) Head Office: This would be at the NAPIO's headquarters in Seoul.
It would generally direct the service, and maintain liaison with other
divisions within NAPIO and with other agencies concerned in the project,
notably NSC, OSPD, ORD and the APB of the MAF. The Director and Section
Chief would be located at the main office in Seoul.
(b) Field Supervision Section: This section would be set up at
Suweon and would supervise (i) field inspection, control of seed harvesting,
transportation, processing and storage; (ii) seed sampling, sealing and
labelling; (iii) conduct "pre" and "post" control on-growing trials on land
to be provided at Suweon - i.e., to test breeder, foundation, registered,
certified, and other seed samples by growing small sub-samples alongside
known standard samples to check genetic purity and other factors such as
varietal admixture, presence of seed-borne diseases which may not be
discernible in the laboratory; (iv) test all seed samples drawn by NAPIO
field inspectors at the instance of SCS's Administrative and Seed Trade
Regulation Section; (v) maintain a register of seed growers and stocks; and
(vi) train Crop Inspectors and Guidance Officers.
7.        The NAPIO/SCS would delegate powers to its inspectors, samplers
and analysts for access and inspection at any reasonable time (a) to fields
of crops producing seed under the Scheme; (b) to premises, plant and
records where seeds under the Scheme are processed and stored; (c) to
premises of retailers who are selling seed produced under the Scheme; (d)
to draw samples from fields, at threshing, during processing and at points
of storage; Ce) to conduct tests on seeds as prescribed; (f) to issue
laboratory certificates for seeds that fulfill the required conditions; and
(g) to conduct pre and post-control tests.
8.        Regional Offices:  A regional office of the SCS would be established
at the NAPIO office in each province where field crop and potato processing
plants are situated. The chief would be an officer of the Field Supervision
Section. He would supervise two analysts for potato quality control and the
existing specially trained field crop and potato crop inspectors. Appropriate
offices, laboratories and transport facilities would be provided. Inspectors
would be required about three months per year for inspections and sampling
work for this project.
9.        National Seeds Laboratory:  This would be a fully staffed and
equipped seeds laboratory located at Suweon to handle 5,000 samples per
annum. It would provide a national seed testing service to KNSC and to



ANNEX 5
Page 4
farmers, farmer organizations, seed companies, seed traders, government                K
agencies, etc. Examinations would cover purity analysis, determination of
weeds and other seeds, germination, seed health, moisture content and
varietal identity. It would issue seed analysis certificates. It would
random check results of NAPIO/SCS branch seed laboratories for seed samples
drawn by Field Supervision Section officers in seed growing areas. Seed
analysts would be trained at the laboratory.
10.       A Section Chief and six analysts would be needed at full develop-
ment. The Section Chief would be required to attend a suitable training
course similar to that provided at the National Institute of Agricultural
Botany, Cambridge, U.K. or at the Seed Technology Laboratory, Starkville,
Mississippi and to receive four weeks familiarization before the course and
four weeks instruction in administration of a Seed Testing Laboratory. Seed
analysts, crop inspectors, guidance officers and seed group chiefs would be
trained locally and at the ORD and COA/SNU training centers Suweon.
11.       One inspector would be needed for each 80 ha of cropland producing
Certified seed. Each field would be inspected before the crop is planted
and at least once during the growing season. An inspector would be present
during the threshing of contract crops. Estimated areas for the project to
be inspected for Certified seed by years are as follows:

Barley)            -         -      700    2,000         3,000
12.       The Director of the SCS would have appropriate technical training
and administrative experience. An experienced expatriate seed certification
expert would advise for three years. Additionally, an experienced seed
analyst would be provided for a total of one year to review training and
laboratory techniques and procedures of the National Seeds Laboratory and
Branch Seeds analysts. The Director of the Service and Section Chiefs
would be granted scholarships to attend appropriate seed testing courses.
13.       Investment Costs:  The estimated cost for facilities and items of
equipment are summarized in Annex 7. Procurement specifications are given
in Annex 9. Recurrent costs are summarized in Annex 11.

14.       Recovery of Costs:  The SCS would recover additional costs of
operation from suitable charges levied against those who use its services.
A certification fee for inspection of US$5.00 per ha and a charge of 50
cents (US) per ton for sampling and 50 cents (US) per ton for fixing certi-
fication labels and tags would recover all added project costs. A general
charge of US$1.25 would be made for each sample submitted for analysis
by other than project seed growers.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
1.        The MAF would be responsible for over-all project coordination of
the appropriate departments, agencies and provincial governments and with
the ADC it -would manage the feasibility studies. An agency, the Office for
Seed Production and Distribution (OSPD) would be established in the MAF to
be responsible for project investments concerned with the production, pro-
curement, processing, storage, packaging and distribution of seeds. Project
investments for strengthening the seed certification services would be
managed by NAPIO. Crop research and the production of Breeder, Foundation
and Registered seed would be managed by ORD with the assistance of USAID
parallel financing. The NSC would assist the MAF by recommending seed
varieties for multiplication each crop season and by providing suggested
general standards for seed certification and regulation of the industry.
_      All of these departments and agencies, except OSPD, are experienced in
working together under the leadership of the MAF for the operation of the
existing crop research and seed program (Annex 2). Functional responsibilities
for each department and agency are summarized below.
B. The Office for Seed Production and Distribution (OSPD)
2.        The OSPD would be established by the ROK by amending the Seed Law
of Staple Crops (Law no. 975) of January 16, 1972 as amended (Annex 6). It
would operate as a separate agency in the MAF under regulations issued
pursuant to the Seed Law and under the direction of a Chief Executive Officer
who would be responsible directly to the Assistant Minister. Administrative
divisions of the OSPD would be responsible for project administration and
operations, financing and budget control, seed production and procurement,
farm machinery operations and seed processing and distribution. A manager
trained in seeds production processing, storage and marketing, would be in
charge of operations at each seed plant. Terms of reference are given in
Appendix C.
3.        The Chief Executive Officer would prepare a budget that estimates
the capital and operating expenditures, including contingencies prior to the
beginning of each fiscal year. He would be entitled to transfer, with prior
advice to the Minister of EPB, between categories and sub-categories or
groups the funds allocated by the budget.  The investment line headings



ANNEX 6
Page  2
would be more or less as given in Annex 7, Table 1. Operation line headings
would include a Revolving Fund (para 4.04) and a separate account for the
hire-operation of the farm machinery provided by the project. The OSPD
would receive financing from ROK for its investment and operating budget on
an annual basis and for its Revolving Fund on a permanent basis. The
Revolving Fund would be used for the procurement of seeds from contract
growers and would be credited with the entire proceeds of its seeds sales
less distribution expenses. Surpluses, if any, could be used for annual
operating expenses. ROK would finance the Revolving Fund at the commencement
of the fiscal year with not less than the Won equivalent of US$300,000 in
1975, US$1.1 million in 1976, US$4.1 million in 1977 and US$5.4 million in
1978.
4.        The OSPD would be responsible for implementation of all aspects
of the project concerning the production, processing, packaging and distri-
bution of Certified seeds. In this respect the Chief Executive Officer and
his administration and operations divisions, with the assistance from
domestic and expatriate consultants would design each seed plant, specify
equipment, prepare tender documents, evaluate bids and supervise construction
of civil works and the installation of equipment. After construction has
been completed, the staff would be trained by the suppliers and the consultants
in the operation of the seed plants. The budget control division would
maintain project investment and operations accounts on a commercial accounting
basis.
5.        An analysis of the projected monthly cash flow of OSPD shows that
these inventories reach a peak in November each year and remain at high levels
until the following June. If the funding of seed inventories were achieved by
commercial bank financing the interest charge would be about 1.5% per month
and the availability each month in the amounts needed would not be assured.
In addition, seed prices would need to be increased by US$25.00 to US$30.00
per ton to recover the high interest charge. At these higher prices the
volume of sales would be reduced and the financial rate of return for the
OSPD and the national economic rate of return would be greatly reduced.
If financed from annual budget appropriations, the OSPD would have the high
risk of disapproval or delay in obtaining the needed funds. The risk of
inadequate financing would be minimized if a Revolving Fund were provided for
this purpose.
6.        During the 30 year estimated life of the project the OSPD would
recover its costs; i.e. administration and overhead, procurement, processing,
storage, distribution, plant repair and maintenance and loan service charges;
from the sale of seeds. Its costs for Registered seed and for farm
machinery operations would be recovered from seed growers. Fees paid NAPIO
would recover its investment and operating costs for the certification of
project seeds. Estimated operating costs are detailed in Annex 11.
7.        To recover the above project costs at 1972 prices, it would be
necessary to price the field crop Certified seeds to farmers at an average
margin of 65% above and seed potato at 160% above the crop harvest prices.
In the existing program field crop seeds have been priced at 20% above
harvest prices for average quality seeds and as high as 100% above for



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Registered seed and seed of new varieties.  Seed potato are usually sold
with a margin 100% or more above the harvest price. At these prices, ROK
absorbs a loss of about US$1.0 million per year or US$20.00 per ton of seed
for the payment of the premium to seed growers and US$5.00 per ton for
seed promotion activities. With the project all of the grower premium costs
and a part of the seed promotion costs would be transferred to the OSPD.
8.        Korean farmers may not be willing to purchase the available
supply of project seeds at 65% or 160% above harvest prices for the first
three or four years. Pricing seeds at, say, a 40% mark-up for field crops
and 120% for seed potato the first year of operations (1975 for potato and
1976 for field crops) and gradually increasing the mark-up to cover all
costs by 1979 would be acceptable. Losses accruing during this time would
be covered by the annual operating budget and the Revolving Fund. It would
also be necessary for the ROK and the respective provinces to transfer their
existing support of the seed industry for field crops and seed potato to
the OSPD.
9.        However, during the 30 year life of the project costs and the percent
mark-up for each crop would be sensitive to harvest prices, premium arrange-
ments contracted with the FLIA Certified seed growers, deviations from the
projected volumes and operational costs. The necessary selling price as cal-
culated above may not be the appropriate price to be charged farmer-users of
the OSPD Certified seeds. Selling prices would be determined for each crop
*       each year and should be adjusted to reflect changes in costs, the value of
crop yield responses obtained from the use of Certified seeds, the intro-
duction of new varieties, competitive prices and reliability of seeds
available from other sources and other market factors.
10.       While the MAF has had extensive experience in the production and
distribution of seeds with its existing subsidized program, it has had only
limited experience in the marketing of Certified seeds. Market experience
in the sale of its surplus Registered seeds and the introduction of Tongil,
a new higher yielding paddy variety, indicate that farmer-users were willing
and did pay up to double the market grain price for these items. However,
the OSPD would need to continuously evaluate demand for its various crop
varieties and to analyze costs so that all Certified seed produced would be
sold and at prices sufficient to recover all costs. Therefore, the OSPD
would establish an operational research section to help it evaluate costs
and demand factors needed to set seed selling prices so as to recover full
production costs. Full production costs would be defined to include (a)
seed procurement; (b) operations of and maintenance and depreciation on
buildings, plant, machinery, equipment and materials used in growing,
processing, marketing and distributing seeds; (c) overhead, representing
administration and other indirect expenses incurred; (d) interest paid on
borrowings; (e) taxes paid; and (f) a return on net capital employed on a
long term basis.
.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
C. NAPIO
11.       The OSPD would arrange with NAPIO to perform independent
inspections and laboratory tests as needed to determine eligibility of
all seeds sold as Registered or Certified.  Seeds meeting these standards
would be labelled and distributed as such. Seeds that failed to meet the
certification standards, would be marketed as commercial seeds, if viable,
or as grain or potato.  NAPIO would charge inspection fees at rates sufficient
to cover the added costs of its services (see Annex 5, para 14). NAPIO would
regulate the entire seeds industry in Korea.
D. The National Seeds Council (NSC)
12.       The NSC would be reorganized under the chairmanship of the MAF
Vice Minister and would advise the MAF on the planning, formulation of policy,
regulation of the Seeds Law, approval of the recommended varieties for each
crop and any other matters as necessary for an orderly development of a sound
seeds industry. The Vice Minister as chairman would act for the Minister of
Agriculture who would appoint other members of the Council to include
representatives of OSPD, OKD, NAPIO, APB, provincial governments, COAs and
the private seed industry.  The director of the APB would serve as secretary
for the NSC. The NSC would be advised on technical matters by appropriate
committees with members who are experts in a particular field.  Such committees
would include (a) variety review and recommendations; (b) seed imports and
exports, and (c) seed standards, and regulation of the seeds industry.
13.       Varieties would be included in the Recommended List only if satis-
factory trial results show them to be above average in agro-economic aspects
and that they had distinct, uniform and stable characteristics. Applications
from plant breeders for varieties to be included on the Recommended List
would be accompanied by a full description including morphological, physiolo-
gical and agronomic-economic characteristics. Samples of Breeder seed would
be reproduced and tested from time to time to ensure that varietal purity
had been properly maintained.
E. Project Technical Assistance
14.       The ROK lacks technical experience in the design, construction,
operation and management of a seeds processing industry. Also the NAPIO
lacks experience in the field inspection and laboratory operations of a
Certified seeds program that uses internationally accepted procedures.
There also would be a need for legal expertise for revisions of the Seeds
Law and preparation of OSPD's terms of reference and tender documents.
Therefore, to achieve project objectives, expatriate consultants would be
engaged to assist as follows:

15.       The USAID parallel financing of crop research would provide about
75 man-years of technical assistance during the first five years of the project.
Expatriates with expertise in crop breeding, plant pathology, plant chemistry,
agronomy, cropping systems, agricultural engineering and agricultural
*       economics would be included.  Their terms of reference and arrangements have
not been detailed in this report.
F. Training of Staff
16.       Because of lack of experience with a seed program of the type
proposed for the project, the OSPD technical staff would need to be trained.
The project provides for international travel and study for the Chief Execu-
tive Officer and selected key staff members. Equally important, the plant
managers, guidance officers and technicians of all types, about 100 people,
who would be trained on the job. The consultants and the appropriate OSPD,
NAPIO and ORD officers would be responsible for organizing and providing
this training.

KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
FEASIBILITY STUDIES
Okeso Irrigation and Area Development Project
Outline of Additional Studies to be Carried Out
1.        Project investigations should be carried out in two phases.  The
first should be a review of all information already available in existing
reports to determine a rational sequence for development of the Lower Geum
river basin in step with the overall river basin development program. The
review should be based largely on data presented in the 1972 Nippon Koei
Consulting Engineers Report on the Geum River Overall Development Project
(prepared under contract with the Ministry of Construction), the Okeso
Area Agricultural Development Project Report prepared by ADC, and other
available data. Additional studies and investigations should also be
carried out in connection with the review process as necessary. The main
objectives of the review will be to:
(a) determine whether development of the lower basin could
proceed independently of the proposed dam construction
program in the upper reaches:
(b) reconcile the various proposals for development of the
lower Geum river basin area in relation to the basin's
overall development plan;
(c) determine a rational sequence for development of the area's
land and water resources with due regard to the requirements
of all potential users; and
(d) identify a first stage project for immediate development.
2.        During the review process particular attention should be given to
the following:
(a) present and potential water requirements for power, industry,
navigation, domestic and municipal use, and agriculture;
0



ANNEX 6
Appendix B
Page  2
(b) existing and potential water resources, both surface and
ground, which could be utilized to meet the various require-
ments in the Lower Geum basin;
(c) evaluation of the relative merits of various ways to meet the
increased demand for water in the Lower Geum basin by:
(i) constructing the Daecheong dam (or one of the alternative
dams investigated by Nippon Koei) on the upper reaches of
the Geum river and serving the lower basin either by means
of a diversion weir at Buyeo and a gravity feeder canal
down to the area or by pumping water from the river at
Bongjeong;
(ii) enlarging the existing reservoirs in the lower basin and/or
reallocating water use from power to irrigation;
(iii) constructing a weir and storage reservoir on the Geum
above Gunsan;
(iv) closure of the Mangyeong Dongjin estuary by a sea-dike.
(d) assessment of the impact of alternative water supply sources
outlined at (c) above on such aspects as siltation of Gunsan
harbor, flooding of agricultural lands, drainage requirements,
navigation, road transport, and river embankment protection;
and
(e) evaluation of the irrigable land potential on the basis of soil
classification, suitability to various types of irrigation, and
drainage requirement.
3.        A feasibility study should be prepared for the area identified
for first stage development during the review process. The study should
be prepared in accordance with the FAO Guideline for Preparation of
Feasibility Studies. To save time, several of the field investigations
required for the feasibility study (e.g. soil surveys, mapping, socio-
economic data, etc.) should start concurrently with the overall review.
4.        The feasibility study should pay special attention to the following:
(a) review of ADC's organization structure should be carried out
and detailed recommendations made regarding the best means
of coordinating activities between the different projects
being constructed by the agency (including the planning, design,
execution, and agricultural development phases of the project).
Specific recommendations should also be made regarding training
of staff and other steps which ADC could take to improve its
overall performance;
S



ANNEX 6
Appendix B
Page  3
(b) preparation of a detailed Ten-Year Agricultural Development
Plan along the lines of the Pyongtaek-Kumgang and Yong
San Gang projects. The plan should include specific
recommendations for the necessary supporting agricultural
services together with cost estimates, financing plan,
personnel requirements, and an implementation program;
(c) incorporating into the project the area development and
community development programs recommended by the UNDP
Watershed Management Project (e.g. bench terracing for
rainfed development of orchards and field crops along with
pasture development on the lower slopes, development of
fish ponds, and community improvement schemes);
(d) investment levels and design criteria for on-farm develop-
ment (land consolidation) should be clearly established,
taking into account the present on-going review of the
subject by ADC;
(e) preparation of preliminary designs and layout of the
irrigation and drainage network with a view to eliminating
high cost areas from the project; and
(f)  preparation of detailed cost estimates, paying particular
attention to the required foreign exchange, physical and
price contingency requirements, unit rates for different
categories of work, and estimates of work quantities.

KOREAN SEEDS PROJECT
RECURRENT COSTS AND REVETUES
A. Estimated Cash Flow for OSPD (Table 1)
Inflow
(a) The IBRD Bank Loan inflow was based on the estimated foreign
exchange expenditures as given in Annex 7.
(b) The OSPD Capital includes the local share of the investment
costs and provision for the Revolving Fund.
(c) Revenues from seed sales and farm machinery charges are detailed
in Tables 2 and 7, respectively.
Outflow
(a)  Investment Costs are detailed in Annex 7, Table 1 and includes
contingencies.
(b) Recuirrent Costs are detailed in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6.
General
(a)  Project effective date of Janiuary 1, 1974 and investment costs
as given in Annex 7.
(b)  Fiscal year of January 1 to Decem.ber 31.
B. Estimated Revenues from Seed Sales (Table 2)
These calculations assume that from each 127.5 kgs of field crop
grain of 16Z moisture equivalent delivered to the OSPD processing plant
5.5 kgs are lost in drying anid handling, 22 kgs are separated into Grade D
during fine cleaning and sold as feed grain and 100 kgs would be packaged
as Certified or Commercial seed. To obtain 100 kgs of Certified seed potato
the seed groxwer would deliver 115 kgs; 3 kgs are lost in drying and 12 kgs
are graded out for non-seed use. Prices for each type of marketable product
are given.

C. Recurrent Costs for OSPD Main Office (Table 3)
These costs are for the OSPD main office at Seoul and include
staff and office expenditures incurred for the operation of the seed busi-
ness. Costs of this type incident to project construction are given in
Annex 7, Table 2, as investment costs and are not included here.
D. Estimated Recurrent Costs for Processing Plant (Tables 4 and 5)
Seed plant operating costs including the cost of seed procurement
are given here. Seed producers would be paid in the basis of 16% moisture
equivalent delivery to the seed plant and adjusted by laboratory analysis
for the estimated component of certified seed, clean out of admixtures
and Grade D. The 1972 base prices for each grade (Table 2) plus a 10%
incentive payment for paddy seed and a 20% premium on other seed meeting
certification standards were used to calculate costs.
E. Estimated Recurrent Cost of Seed Distribution (Table 6)
These estimates were based on costs provided by NACF.
F. Factors for Farm Machlinery Operating Costs and Charges (Table 7)
These data were developed from information provided by the IAF
and the mission's estimates of probable life and costs. These costs would
be recovered from seed grower-users at the hourly or hectare rates given.
G. Budget for NAPIO Incurred by OSPD Operations (Table 8)
These recurring costs are for operating the Seed Certification
Service inspection, laboratory analysis and labelling activities incident
to the marketing of OSPD Certified seed. The rates paid NAPIO by OSPD for
these services would cover NAPIO's costs and would be recovered from the
sale of Certified seed.

Table 9: Paddy Seed/Regular Barley Seed Rotation
The estimates are for a 20 hectare unit where paddy would be
followed by 15 hectares of regular barley.  Farming operations, which were
all done by manual labor and animal drawn power before the project, would
be partly mechanized at full development.
Land preparation and lime spreading for both paddy and barley
as well as seeding and fertilizing for barley would be fully mechanized,
while harvesting would be done partly by manual labor and partly by self-
propelled combines. Trailers instead of animal drawn carts would be used
for transport of inputs, implements and agricultural produce. More labor
would be used for rogueing.
The cost estimates before the project were based on surveys
conducted by the Korean Institute of Agricultural Economics and on the
data furnished in the Yearbook of Agriculture and Forestry Statistics,
MAF for 1972.
It is envisaged that at full development paddy and regular paddy
yields would be 5 and 3 tons respectively as against the national average
yields of 4.3 and 2.6 tons respectively. The net income per hectare at
*         full development would be about US$1,198 per hectare as against US$884
before the project, giving an increment of US$314 per hectare.
Table 10: Paddy Seed Crop Per Hectare
The assumptions and basis of calculations are more or less the
same as for Table 9.
The net income per hectare at full development would be about
US$912 as against US$735 before the project, giving an increment of US$717.
Table 11: Naked Barley Seed Crop Per Hiectare
The assumptions and basis of calculations are more or less the
same as for Table 9.
The net income per hectare at full development would be about
US$303 as against US$208 before the project, giving an increment of US$95.

Table 12:  Wheat Seed Crop Per Hectare
The assumptions and basis of calculations are more or less the
same as for regular barley in Table 9.
The net income per hectare at full development would be about
US$222 as against US$121 before tne project, giving an increment of about
US$101.
Table 13: Soybeans Seed Crop Per Hectare
Farming operations currently performed by manual labor and drawn
animal power would be partly mechanized at full development. Land prepara-
tion, seed drilling and fertilizing would be mechanized and transport of
inputs, implements and agricultural produce would be by tractor-trailer.
Other operations would be by manual labor.
This net income per hectare at full development would be about
US$232 as against US$72 before the project, giving an increment of about
US$160.
Table 14: Potato Registered Seed Farm - 450 HIa
The estimates are for field operations only and exclude salaries
and allowances of permanent staff. To produce disease free seed, potato is
grown on the same land only once in three years. Therefore the annual area
under potato would remain at 150 hectares. However, with the provision of
2 tractors and equipment, it should be possible to increase the area under
maize, oilseeds and wheat to 100, 50 and 100 hectares respectively, about
double the hectarage before the project.
The net income per hectare would be about US$375 as against US$169
before the project, giving an increment of US$206.
Table 15: Seed Potato Crop
Farming operatives, which are performed by manual labor and animal
drawn power would be partly mechanized. Land preparation, lime spreading
and potato digging would be mechanized, and transport of inputs, implements
and harvested crop would be done by tractor drawn trailers.



ANNEX 11
Page  5
The average yield per hectare at full development would be about
15 tons as against the national average of 10.6 tons before the project.
The net income per hectare at full development would be US$833 as against
US$489 before the project, giving an increment of US$344.
Table 16: Incremental Value Per Hectare with Project Seeds
On the basis of field trails and investigations conducted by ORD,
it is envisaged that crops grown with project seeds would give an average
yield increase of about 6% for paddy, 12% each for regular barley, naked
barley, and wheat, 10% of soybeans and 50% for potato.
After allowing for added costs, the increment per hectare would
be about US$45 for rice, US$29 for regular barley, US$34 for naked barley,
.US$25 for wheat, US$9 for soybeans, and US$253 for potato..

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KORE&i SEEDS PROJECT
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL RATES OF RETURN
A. Economic Rate of Return
1.        The incremental revenue used to calculate the economic rate of
return was based on the assumption that a farmer using project Certified
seed would obtain yield increases of 6% for paddy, 12% for barley and
wheat, 10% for soybeans and 50% for potato. These yield increases were
based on ORD research and similar research and farmer experience in other
countries. The high rate used for potato reflects the advantages of disease
free seed and the current low yields for this crop.
2.        Prices used were provided by the Bank's Economic Analysis and
Projections Department and represent 1980 projected international prices
cif Korean ports without discount for inflation.  Prices used were US$135/ton
X         for polished rice, US$85/ton for naked barley, US$75/ton for regular barley,
US$80/ton for wheat, US$130/ton for soybeans and US$74/ton for potato.
3.        The detailed calculations of incremental revenue as given in
Table 1 were based on the tons of Certified seed projected for sale, the
area it would sow at current Korean seeding rates and the value of incre-
mental production at the above yield responses and prices.
4.        The cost stream included the project investment costs for crop
research (ORD-USAID) and the OSPD investment and annual recurring costs,
excluding price contingencies, less the commercial grain value of the
Certified seed. This deduction represents the farmer-user's before project
cost for seed. The added cost for harvesting, threshing and marketing of the
increased production was not deducted as it would be equalized by benefits
derived by the farmer saving his own seed from the crop produced by the
project Certified field crop seeds. However, potato seed would need
replacement each year to control seed borne diseases.
5.        The economic rate of return would be 47.6%.  Details are given
in Table 2. Sensitivity tests were applied after assuming that yield
increases would be only 50% and 25% of the above. The results were as
follows:

Without seed potato                  37.1        17.3        1.9
The project is moderately sensitive to costs, sales volume and the inclusion
of seed potato and highly sensitive to yield increase rates achieved from
the use of Certified seed. Thus it would be desirable for the crop research
component to continue to provide new higher yielding varieties for multipli-
cation and distribution by the OSPD.
