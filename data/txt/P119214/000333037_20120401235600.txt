Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main objective of the proposed DPL is to mitigate the impact of the current fiscal
crisis on Iraq's economy and to support its medium-term economic reform program,
thereby helping the country improve fiscal sustainability and reducing its fiscal and socio-
economic vulnerability to sudden drops in oil revenues.

1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

Appraisal of this operation was completed on December 14, 2009.

Macroeconomic context

The Republic of Iraq—with an estimated population of about 30 million—has been facing various
conflicts over the last 30 years, and most recently since March 20, 2003. As the conflict in Iraq peaked in
2006, by all accounts, the country faced substantial development challenges. Chief among these was the
need to rebuild its infrastructure and institutions after a tragic history of authoritarian rule followed by
war and occupation, a task made difficult by the prospect of political instability and the excessive
dependence on one commodity, crude oil, for its revenues.

Iraq is an oil-dependent economy and fully subjected to the volatility of international oil prices. Revenues
from crude oil exports account for about two-thirds of the country‘s GDP and for almost all of its export
and fiscal revenues. Volatility of international oil prices translates into volatility of Iraq‘s oil export and
as a result, into a high volatility of its fiscal revenues. Between summer 2008 and summer 2009, crude oil
export revenues dropped by about 40 percent.

The rapid decline of the international oil price in 2009 resulted in an unusual financing need and fiscal
adjustment in Iraq. The forecast used for the 2009 budget preparation assumed a drop from an average of
US$91.5 per barrel for Iraq‘s oil export price in 2008 to a projected average price of US$55.6 per barrel
in 2009 (the actual average export turned out to be US$57 per barrel), causing a rapidly deteriorating
fiscal position,1 then projected to lead to an overall fiscal deficit of US$15 billion in 2010, US$5.3 billion
in 2011, as oil revenues were presumed to recover. The overall fiscal deficit was estimated to amount to
only US$8.1 billion for 2010, if international oil prices would be 15 percent higher than in the baseline
scenario (76.5 US$/b for 2010 versus a price 62.5 US$/barrel assumed for the 2010 budget). At the same
time, fiscal surpluses of earlier years2 were run down by the end of 2009 to just over 10 billion, and
assumed to be reduced to US$2.6 billion by end 2010, taking into account already massive domestic
financing operations of about US$3.4 billion. The resulting estimated financing gap through end-2011
amounted to US$5 billion. At the same time, the level of domestic financing (T-bills) was planned to be
augmented to US$9 billion.

While a large fiscal adjustment was assumed to be unavoidable in 2009, the country was gradually
emerging from conflict and its reconstruction and rehabilitation program—both from an infrastructure and
from an institutional standpoint—had gained some traction since 2006. The dependence of Iraq‘s fiscal
position on a volatile oil price, coupled with the dependence of the economy on the state, put into
question the sustainability of the early reconstruction successes and an emerging political consensus
around it, if the required fiscal adjustment could not be mitigated.

After holding fiscal surpluses in the order of 8.8 percent of GDP and 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007 and
2008 respectively, Iraq was projected to have an overall fiscal deficit of about 22.6 percent of GDP in
2009. Mirroring the fiscal accounts, Iraq‘s current account balance was projected to move from a

significant surplus in 2008 to a major deficit in 2009. With the fall in oil export receipts, a current account
deficit in the order of US$12.8 billion (or 19.4 percent of GDP) was projected for 2009. Therefore, in the
short term, Iraq was projected to face a major external financing gap. A considerable financing gap—in
the order of US$4.9 billion—had emerged for the period 2009-2011.

Structural/sector background

While macroeconomic stabilization and reconstruction had been making progress by end-2009, the
structural reform agenda in Iraq was progressing since 2007. The Government‘s reconstruction and
recovery program is outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) and International Compact
with Iraq (ICI). The NDS was presented in July 2005 and structured around four pillars for sustainable
development, which remain relevant to Iraq‘s present conditions: (i) strengthening the foundations of
economic growth; (ii) revitalizing the private sector as the engine for growth and job creation; (iii)
improving the quality of life; and (iv) strengthening good governance and security. The ICI concentrates
on four reform and investment areas as well as in two specific sectors: (i) public resource management;
(ii) governance and institutions; (iii) economic reforms; (iv) social sector reforms; (v) energy; and (vi)
agriculture.

The public financial management was known to require substantial reforms to become more efficient and
deliver the public services needed for reconstruction and development. The banking sector delivered less
than 10 percent of GDP as credit to the economy in 2009,3 reflecting its past legacy as a state dependent
financial sector. The system of two pension funds, with the state pension fund providing superior benefits
compared to those provided by the fund servicing the private sector, had to be reformed in order to reduce
the advantages for work in the public sector, if the nascent private sector should grow. The Public
Distribution System, distributing 5 key food staples on a monthly basis to almost 99 percent of the
population, was in 2009 the mainstay of the social protection system in Iraq but was not targeted and
therefore costly and ineffective in servicing its purpose.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The reform areas supported by this operation are in line with the priorities of the NDS, the ICI and other
reform initiatives by the Government. The specific areas supported were (i) public financial management;
(ii) financial sector reform; and (iii) reforms to the social protection system to increase its efficiency and
fiscal sustainability. These were either helping fiscal consolidation and rationalization/reprioritization of
Iraq‘s public expenditure program (social safety net, public distribution system , and pension reform) – in
line with the NDS –, or helping to revitalize private sector growth, including through financial sector
reforms based on a reform program endorsed by Government in February 2009.

The Interim Strategy Note for 2009-11 supported the policy areas covered by the this DPL (i) support
ongoing reconstruction and socio-economic recovery; (ii) improve governance and the management of
public resources; and (iii) support policies and institutions that promote broad-based, private sector-led
growth. In all three areas the Bank was also engaged with investment and technical assistance as well as
AAA work, especially in the PFM area, the financial sector reform and the reform of the social protection
system.

In addition to assisting Iraq with financial resources to meet short-term financing need, the DPL was
opening a door for a robust medium-term reform dialogue with the Government. The ongoing Bank

assistance and policy engagement to Iraq created the opportunity to seek commitment in well-defined
areas for reform, providing the basis for a strong medium-term reform program for Iraq.

At appraisal, World Bank budget support to Iraq, leveraged by the IMF‘s two year Stand-by-Arrangement
(SBA), was considered critical to help withstanding complex political vulnerabilities compounded by the
immediate fiscal difficulties. These difficulties were triggered by the revenue shock, brought about by
steeply declining oil prices in the wake of the global financial crisis. The Bank and IMF support for Iraq‘s
fiscal stabilization and reform efforts were enabling the country to continue its reconstruction and service
delivery initiatives—a prerequisite to consolidate the incremental political stability and security
improvements. Such political economy consideration reflected lessons drawn from other post-conflict and
fragile state experience, suggesting a link between the ability to deliver public services and risks of
conflict.

The then scheduled parliamentary elections for March 7, 2010, epitomized for the short term the linkage
between the perceived political vulnerabilities in Iraq, the desire on all sides to successfully conclude
these elections, and the need for financial assistance to withstand the economic shock triggered by oil
price decline of 2008/2009. The elections were seen to have a significant impact on the future course of
Iraqi politics. In particular, these elections were seen as a test as to whether the risk of resorting to
sectarian or ethnic conflict has been overcome in favor of an orderly political and democratic work-out.4

1.2       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan was to mitigate the impact of the
2009 fiscal crisis on Iraq‘s economy and to support its medium-term economic reform program, thereby
helping the country improve fiscal sustainability and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability
to sudden drops in oil revenues.

More specifically, the project aimed to support the following objectives:

         Helping bridge the financing gap created by lower oil prices;
         Strengthening budget management and prioritization to enable more efficient and effective use of
          Iraq‟s own resources;
         Strengthening the financial sector; and,
         Helping to cushion the social impact of lower oil revenues by reforming social safety nets and the
          pensions system.

The supported reforms in the specific policy areas were seen to be interlinked by their impact on
rationalizing and prioritizing fiscal resources, thereby improving Iraq‘s fiscal sustainability prospects.
First, strengthening budget management and prioritization was seen critical to ensure aggregate fiscal
discipline and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures. Second, financial sector reform was expected
to reduce the direct budgetary burden as well as the risk to the budget posed by state-owned banks. Third,
the reform of the social protection system/ pension reform was meant to support the efficiency, and
thereby add to fiscal sustainability.

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The operation supported the following three policy areas:

1.    Strengthening budget management and prioritization
      The strengthening of budget management and prioritization was meant to be achieved through
      adopting a medium term budget strategy that would be aligned with a Poverty Reduction Strategy
      (PRS). In addition, the reform of the Procurement Law supported the expenditure efficiency.
      Establishing Charts of Accounts aimed at timely, accurate and informative financial reporting,
      improving control, accountability and analysis, and allowing ultimately better budget execution
      analysis and monitoring, being particularly the case for investments aligned with the PRS priorities.

2.    Reforming the financial sector
      This operation supported the Government of Iraq in implementing Phase I of the financial sector
      reform agenda, which focused on restructuring the state-owned commercial banks, strengthening the
      regulatory and supervisory authority, and improving the financial institutional infrastructure. These
      reforms aimed to improve the performance of the financial sector, thereby helping Iraq develop
      private sector-led growth beyond the hydrocarbons sector, and leading ultimately to reducing the
      country‘s dependence on oil revenues. The supported reforms in the financial sector comprised four
      policy areas: (i) financial restructuring of the Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Banks, improving their
      portfolio quality; (ii) institutional and operational restructuring of state-owned commercial banks;
      (iii) strengthening the supervisory and regulatory authority of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) to
      ensure full adherence to the Basel Core Principles; and (iv) operationalizing the real time gross
      settlement (RTGS) payments system, complying with international standards.

3.    Improving the efficiency of the social protection system
      This policy area supported the Government of Iraq to move towards a more efficient and fiscally
      sustainable social protection system as well as better mitigating the impacts of fluctuations in oil
      revenues. It comprises three areas of social protection reforms: (i) rationalization of the Public
      Distribution System (PDS) through better targeting on a more meritocratic basis; (ii) strengthening
      of the Social Safety Net (SSN) by developing more efficient targeting methods to focus on poor and
      vulnerable households; and (iii) strengthening the (private) retirement and (public) pension system
      by (a) establishing a management and governance structure that will allow the State Pension Fund
      (SPF) to moving towards prudent management and investment of the accumulated reserves in the
      fund, while maintaining the ability to adequately meet future liabilities of the pension system; and
      (b) eliminating the de-facto segmentation of the private and public sector labor markets through
      offering a more unified pension/retirement system, which is less biased in favor of the public sector.

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Program Performance

The operation‘s design was based on a programmatic approach in form of two DPL operations. The
second DPL did not materialize, but the strength of the first operation carried forward the progress on
policy and institutional reforms after the prior actions of the DPL I were met. This section presents
program target outcomes (set for a full operation) and evaluates how much progress was made in
achieving the development outcomes in the absence of a second and final operation. The progress and
achievements in the three distinctive policy areas are summarized in the columns labeled ―program actual‖
columns of Tables 1, 3, and 4 below.

Furthermore, the first DPL operation provided a platform for forging coherence to the Bank program. The
Bank‘s program after conclusion of the DPL I continued to deliver assistance to the Iraqi government to
further improve performance in three policy areas supported by this DPL through projects and technical
assistance, such as Public Finance Management Project, Financial Sector Review, Banking Sector Reform
Project, Rationalization of the Public Distribution System Technical Assistance, Poverty Reduction
Strategy, and Pensions Reform Implementation Support Technical Assistance.

The operation was designed as programmatic based on two-Development Policy Loans (DPL), in line
with the decision of the 2nd Operation Review Committee Meeting in early December 2009. The decision
for moving ahead with the second operation was to be based on (1) continuous government commitment;
and (2) on the financing need. The financing need did not materialize with the rise in international oil
prices and oil production in Iraq since 2010.


I.      Strengthening Budget Management and Prioritization

Iraq struggled to make good use of its oil wealth while emerging from conflict.5 Apart of security and
political uncertainty, budget management in Iraq faced numerous weaknesses. They included poor budget
preparation and alignment with government priorities, poor investment project design and selection,
inconsistent and cumbersome procurement procedures, ineffective mechanisms for cash management,
monitoring and control of investment project implementation. By strengthening expenditure controls and
improving aggregate fiscal discipline, PFM reforms were seen as critical to safeguarding fiscal
sustainability and deliver better services. To address these challenges The Government of Iraq designed a
Public Finance Management Action Plan (PFMAP), implemented with assistance from the World Bank
and the IMF.

The PFMAP focuses on three key areas: (i) budget design and preparation; (ii) public procurement; and
(iii) cash management, control and accounting. It brings together efforts aimed at improving budget
preparation and design with execution, accountability and control.

This operation aimed to support the PFM reforms with regard to (i) strengthening the link between
policy and budget over the medium term; including by (ii) the completion of the first annual PRS
monitoring report by the High Committee for Poverty Reduction; (iii) adequate implementation of the
new legal framework for public procurement, including the regulations of the new Public Procurement
Law, the establishment of a Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), and issuance by the
Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MoPDC) of the Standard Bidding Documents
(based on the new Public Procurement Law and Regulations); and (iv) enhancing transparency and budget
control by (1) making available the budget execution data (fiscal accounts) no later than 60 days after the
end of the month, and (2) aligning the applied chart of accounts with the 2011 Budget classification.

There has been progress and achievements on both policy and implementation. The Inter-Ministerial
Budget Strategy Committee completed the development of the budget strategy for 2011-2013, based on
a medium-term fiscal framework. The latest two Budget Strategy discussions (2011 and 2012) reflected
the PRS priorities. The budget call circular issued to Ministries and spending units in June 2010, along
with the strategy, included fixed ceilings for the first time. The budget circular issued in 2011 for
preparing the 2012 budget was aligned with and followed the established medium–term macroeconomic
and fiscal projections, as revised through the dialogue with the IMF. While the medium–term framework
is adhered to on the fiscal or macroeconomic level, the fiscal ceilings are not further broken down in
sector ceilings, indicating the need to widen the medium-term planning process to sector areas (bottom–
up) and creating stronger fiscal linkages with the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS, see below). The Inter-
Ministerial Budget Strategy Committee benefited from day-to-day technical assistance, seminars and
workshops convened by the World Bank. The development partners, which included the IMF, DfID and
the US Treasury Department (USDOT), also provided assistance in the development and refinement of
budget preparation toolkit and procedures.

A Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) was adopted by the Council of Ministers through Decree 409 on
November 24, 2009, publicly launched on January 14, 2010, and debated in Parliament on January 19,
2010. The PRS focuses on six areas: income generation, education, health, safety nets, housing,
environment, and gender. Within each area, the strategy identifies public spending, priorities and related
policy reforms. The implementation of the PRS commenced in 2010. The PRS, besides being
disseminated in the newspaper and other media, has been also presented at the governorate level. An
effort was made to discuss with provincial authorities the specific characteristics of poverty in their areas
and obtain the endorsement of the strategy.

The PRS has not been 'costed' to date, as the authorities consider it a menu of policy options from which
line ministries can pick, integrate (and fund) into their annual plans. The PRS has been aligned with the
2011-14 ministries' plans, which shows marked variability (e.g., 16 percent in education, 100 percent in
health). The PRS informed the development of the 5-year NDP, underpinning the 2011-2013 Budget
Strategy as a key source for policy priorities. As a result, spending composition is expected to change in
favor of the social sectors over the medium term.

Table 2 presents the evolution of public spending in selected sectors in Iraq over the period 2008-2012
showing that there has been some progress in favor of the poverty reduction expenditures as envisaged by
DPL I operation (see DPL I Program Document, Page 12 and Table 4). The budget allocations for
education and health sectors have improved compared to 2008 although the share of health spending in
the total budget is still low compared with regional averages. Also, the share of the Public Distribution
System (PDS) spending—the inefficient and ineffective social safety net program of Iraq—has declined
since 2009 in terms of share of the budget.

The annual progress report on the PRS implementation has not been completed so far, partly because an
applicable monitoring & evaluation system did not exist in Iraq and needed to be built up first. The annual
progress report is now expected to be issued in April 2012.

There are recent developments on the implementation of the PRS. The Deputy PM heads the regular
meetings of the PRS Higher Committee (PRSHC), which works with line ministries and governorates to
absorb PRS activities into annual plans, in line with medium-terms financial plans, and improve the
accounting for results. In a welcome development, the PRSHC now includes the directors of the
investment and operating budgets of the various line ministries. In general, the importance of poverty
reducing spending is now explicitly and publicly raised by policy makers, inducing efforts to ensure
adequate funding for poverty-reducing activities. In this respect, an extra ID500bn was made available in
2012 through the budget for this endeavor. All line ministries have now produced PRS implementation
matrixes. Governorates have also engaged in this exercise. KRG ministries and governorates are fully
integrated into this exercise. In support of this new policy thrust, the design for the implementation of the
second Iraq Household and Socio-Economic Survey (IHSES2) has been completed and the survey was
launched in January 2012.

Public Procurement in Iraq is based on the Order no. 87 of 2008, first issued by the former Coalition
Provisional Authority (CPA). Although it‘s not a law (but an order), neither vetted by the Iraqi political
process, it serves de-facto as a public procurement law. Given its limited legal authority as an order issued
originally in 2003 by the first administration, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Ministries and public
entities have developed a variety of procurement practices that generally do not adhere to established
good practices. The Council of Ministers has therefore in 2009 recommended to repeal the CPA Order no.
87 of 2008.

The Government of Iraq established the inter-ministerial working group, representing 25 members from
different ministries and controlling bodies to draft a new law. The Inter-ministerial Working Committee
(IMWG), assisted by the Bank‘s procurement and legal team, and based on many consultation workshops
with the public, private, and civil society in Erbil, Baghdad, and Amman prepared the procurement and
presented the draft law to the Government for enactment. The new Procurement Law was reviewed and
amended by the Shura Council in late 2009, which sent the revised law with its comments back to the
Council of Ministers in December 2009. The Ministry of Planning assisted by the World Bank, responded

                                                       9
to the amendments in December 2009, and organized a workshop with the IMWC in May 2010 to further
advance the draft law in light of the discussions initiated by the Shura Council.

However the Committee of Economic Affairs of Council of Ministers decided in its session of October 6,
2011, to go ahead with the preparation of public procurement regulations now and consider preparation of
public procurement law at a later stage. To this effect, a committee has been established led by the PM‘s
legal advisor to prepare the regulation anticipating and incorporating the principals and procedures
included in the draft law approved by the Shura Council in 2009. The Bank continues its support to public
procurement through (i) strengthening and supporting Iraqi public sector procurement system; (ii)
institutional capacity building and strengthening of key Iraqi regulatory authorities at the Ministry of
Planning (the Government Contracting Directorate), implementing and controlling institutions, and
private sector organizations in public procurement; (iii) assisting with public procurement, procedures,
documents and practices; and iv) addressing governance issues including complaints mechanism relating
to procurement.

The Ministry of Finance adopted the new GFS-based Chart of Accounts in 2007. An Accounting
Reform Committee was established in October 2009 to codify the new Chart of Accounts and produce an
Implementation Manual, which includes detailed description of the Charts of Accounts codes and
guidance notes on accounting policies and procedures. Although this committee has finalized its work, the
Board of the Supreme Audit has not yet approved the proposal made by the committee. The precise
reason for the approval delay is not known. The delay in approval caused also that the accounting manual
for the implementation of the new Charts of Accounts has not yet been issued. Consequently, there is still
a degree of discretion in applying this new Charts of Accounts, undermining the cohesion of the budget
and the information it contains. The installation and envisaged roll-out of an Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) over the next 18 months can only be fully successful, if there
is agreement and conclusion on the question of the new Chart of Accounts. IFMIS would also help to
harmonize across Ministries the application of the new Charts of Accounts.

Progress has been made concerning the monthly issuance of budget execution reports, which are now
issued within 60 days. Summary of federal budget data for 2007-2011 are publicly available on Iraq‘s
Ministry of Finance website, in addition to annual (2009-2011) and monthly (from January 2011) budget
execution reports.

The Board of Supreme Audits (BSA) has completed the 2007 Government Accounts. It has also begun
work on the reports for 2008 and 2009. However, its task is impaired by the degree of insecurity in the
country, which constraints its work program, and hence its control function.

II.   Reforming the Financial Sector

As of June 2008, the banking system comprised 29 banks, of which two are state-owned commercial
banks (Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank), 23 are private banks, and 4 small state-owned specialized
banks. The two state-owned banks continue to dominate the banking system with around 90 percent of the
banking system‘s total assets, amounting to about US$26 billion, and had accumulated a larger portfolio
of non-performing loans (NPLs).6 Of the total banking system‘s network of 550 branches, 450 are of
state-owned banks. Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank are the largest state-owned banks in Iraq and the

  According to CBI, NPLs for the two state-owned banks reached approximately $15 billion and $17 billion
respectively for Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank as of June 30, 2010. Many of the NPLs were a result of the earlier
practiced political banking and the then following war which caused massive losses of assets for the Bank (branches,
installations, documentation) as well as for its clients.

only ones with a national network of branches (147 and 142 branches respectively). In addition to these
two large state-owned commercial banks, there are three small state-owned specialized banks, namely the
Agriculture Co-operative Bank, the Industrial Bank of Iraq, and the Real Estate Bank of Iraq. 7 Financial
intermediation is weak in Iraq and access to finance is limited.

In this context, the operation aimed to (i) help the settlement of at least 40 percent of non-performing
loans (NPLs) held by Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank as of June 2007, as well as improvement in the
provisioning levels; (ii) assist Rafidain and Rasheed banks to diversify their activities beyond deposit
taking and payment transactions, and play a more active role in financial intermediation; (iii) improve the
functioning of the two state-owned commercial banks; and (iv) transit the banking system to adhering to
the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, and reducing the processing time of
government checks and collections from 25 days to 10 days, making the banking system more effective.

    Ishtiraqi Bank merged in 2011 with Rafidain Bank.
                                                                           11
To this effect, the Government adopted in 2010 an action plan to modernize the banking sector. The plan
took into account the findings and recommendations set forth in the audit reports of the two main state-
owned commercial banks, the Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank. The process of operational and financial
restructuring of state-owned Rasheed and Rafidain banks proceeded gradually and was supported by IMF
and a World Bank technical assistance operations, which also helped to operationalize the reforms agreed
between the IMF and the Iraqi authorities in this policy area. A Ministry of Finance Decree has been
issued on September 21, 2010, to officially establish the Bank Reconciliation Committee, which focuses
on financial restructuring. The financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks—Rasheed
Bank and Rafidain Bank—had been progressing slowly as there were discrepancies between actual NPL
figures and those based on E&Y‘s independent audits. The work of the reconciliation committee needed
therefore to continue up to late 2011 when reconciliation was finalized.

Progress in the institutional and operational restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks has
been achieved. A new organizational structure and a human resource management system have been
adopted in 2011, with the support by the Iraqi authorities endorsing the reforms at a high level meeting in
July 2011.

The regulatory and supervisory functions of the CBI could be strengthened. A new committee on banking
supervision has been formed within the CBI, headed by the Deputy-Governor, who aims to enforce more
forcefully existing regulation. These regulations abide by international standards and include topics such
as, credit classification, capital adequacy, liquidity ratio, liquidity risk management, operational risk
management, market risk related to capital adequacy, interest risk management, foreign currency situation
in banks, and clarification for some items in the new balance sheet. Furthermore, a committee has been
formed to develop a system for supervision on a consolidated basis. While application of the Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision has made progress and capacity has been build at CBI,
applying these principles in a comprehensive sense would need more time and more policy dialogue. The
CBI appreciates the merits and modalities of a self-assessment against the 25 Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision, as a base-line for further reform. While the CBI supervises the state
owned banks, Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank, in accordance with the same principles it supervises the
other in Iraq operating Banks, CBI is still unable to apply the full extent of its mandate and powers, given
the size of these two banks and the political dimension strict application would involve.8

Improving prudential policies in Iraq has some success but progress is slow. Although Iraq stated its
intention to apply Basel II and III, it is unclear whether the capital definition used in the regulations is
fully Basel-conform. Also provisioning rules have not yet been amended to become less lenient, in
particular with regard to ―averaging‖ the quality of loans, and the legal and regulatory work on
reinforcing the internal audit and internal control regulations has not been completed.

The Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) has been operationalized in Iraq‘s banking system.
RTGS participating banks increased from 16 banks in 2006 to reach 44 in 2010. The number of daily
transactions also increased from 120 in 2006 to 500 in 2010. Another major development is the reduction
in timing of processing payment transaction, as it only takes 2-3 hours in 2010, as opposed to 3 days in
2006.

 The balance sheet of these 2 banks remains inflated due to a remaining larger portfolio of NPLs, or not fully
operating credit portfolio, linked also to the large share of state owned enterprises in Iraq these 2 banks inherited, in
an economy which is still generally dominated by state owned enterprises.


                                                           12
Overall, the financial system in Iraq made some progress. Financial intermediation, as evident in the rise
of the private sector loans to GDP ratio, increased from 4 percent in 2008 to 6 percent in October 2011.
The quality of supervision and the restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks, led to an
increase in the provisions-to-non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio, rising from 10 percent in June 2008 to
20 percent in October 2011, and finally the capital adequacy ratio of the two state-owned banks reached
4 percent by October 2011, compared to almost zero in 2008.

III. Improving the Efficiency of the Social Protection System

A key component of the Iraqi Social Protection System is the Public Distribution System (PDS).
Introduced in 1991, the PDS remains important today: 99 percent of Iraqis have a ration card, making
them eligible to receive fixed quantities of commodities on a monthly basis. Among the poor, 78 percent
of calories actually consumed on a daily basis are derived from the PDS. By itself, the PDS keeps a large
number of Iraqis out of poverty and food deprivation. While effective as a poverty reduction and food
security program, the PDS is costly (around ID4.1 billion in 2011) and inefficient, and its management is
rudimentary, making it vulnerable to waste, theft and corruption. Calculations suggest that it costs more
than US$6 to transfer US$1 worth of food to a poor beneficiary. The PDS also distorts domestic food
markets and crowds out the private sector, as large quantities of imported food depress domestic food
prices, reducing the incentive for domestic production.

Reforms on the PDS have been initiated but progress has been uneven. Only 5 items are now available
and distributed under the PDS, i.e. wheat flour, rice, sugar, vegetable oil and instant formula milk for
children; but there have been shortages and the quality of the food items has deteriorated in some
instances. On the targeting front, households with income exceeding ID1.5 m, household members with
tax accounts exceeding ID18 m, and certain categories of public sector employees (e.g., directors general
and above) have been excluded from the PDS to date.9 But difficulties in obtaining reliable income data
and lack of capacity to develop alternative selection criteria have hampered further efforts.

Piloting Social Safety Net reforms with new and improved targeting mechanism are under way. The
World Bank provides considerable technical assistance to the Iraqi authorities to improve the PDS data
base and build capacity with regard to modeling alternative support scenarios under a range of different
criteria and assumptions. More recently, the introduction of housing and asset ownership criteria were
identified and used, reducing the exclusion and inclusion and error by 17 and 18 percent respectively.
Furthermore, the World Bank team and Iraqi counterparts have worked on the development of a
methodology based on proxy means testing (PMT). The PMT model can be implemented as a simple one-
page „scorecard‟ that could be used as the main targeting tool, not only for the PDS but also for other
social protection programs and targeting exercises in Iraq (e.g., Social Safety Net). The agreed plan is to
refine the PMT model with the data of the recently completed Iraq Knowledge Survey (IKN) and
upcoming first quarter results of the IHSES-2 (available in April 2012) and use the refined scorecard for
the update of the PDS database in 2013. This may also include a question asking current PDS
beneficiaries to ‗give up‘ the food ration system.

Although the uncertainty about the PDS reform delayed the information campaign, the PDS High
Committee agreed in April 2011 on the need for a communication strategy to underpin the PDS reform.
The PDS High Committee has established a Communication Sub-committee in April, which will oversee
the elaboration of a communication needs assessment (CNA) on the PDS reform. Following a request
from the GOI, the World Bank is helping to identify a suitable consultant for the CNA. The CNA will

identify key audiences and their positions, assess government capacity to communicate, analyze the
media, sociopolitical and cultural environments, recommend areas for research, and outline the strategic
guidelines for the communication plan, including implementation arrangements. Given that, neither the
PDS targeting objective could yet be announced, nor a timeline for an envisaged transition,
implementation of this component is delayed.

effective in December 2007. The Pension Law (Law 27) passed in January 2006 and was amended in
December 2007 to improve financial sustainability and alter the design of public sector pensions in line
with good international practices. This new law is referred to as the Unified Pension Law and requires the
merger of the public and private sector pension schemes by 2010. The envisioned merger is desirable in
as much as it alleviates the segmentation of the labor market along the public/private divide and begun to
eliminate the distortion in the system in favor of the public employees‘ State Pension Fund, which
captures resources currently equivalent to 5 percent of GDP.

The National Board of Pensions (NBP) has been established as the unifying body of the mandatory
pension schemes. The NBP harbors already the newly established State Pension Fund (SPF), which

                                                                         14
provides pension benefits to public sector workers retiring on or after January 17, 2008. Furthermore, the
existing Social Security System, the private sector pension scheme, is to be transferred under the
authority of the NBP. Even if all the implementation issues of the new Pension Law are resolved, the
unified mandatory pension system in Iraq will cover only one fourth of the labor force.

Although the law to unify the pension system through merging the public and private pension fund exists,
with NBP being the supervisory and unifying body, the implementation of the merger has progressed only
on the administrative side. The Social Security System—the private sector retirement fund—constitutes
now a department (called the Pension & Social Security Department - PSSD), reporting to the Chairman
of the NBP. The merger of the two pension funds involves important political economy questions, which
have until today hampered implementation of the law. However, the Iraqi government is cognizant about
the distortion this creates for developing a private sector in Iraq. It recognized that employment growth in
Iraq can only come from an expanding private sector, and a non-discriminatory pension system would be
a pre-requisite for expanding the private sector.

The currently prevailing Iraqi view is that a two-phase approach to the merger would be more in line with
Iraqi realities: Phase I, in the short-term, would see the enactment of legislation that would see common
rules across both schemes and consolidation of the administrative and operational agencies, but would
keep each scheme under separate management boards and separate funds; and Phase II, in the medium- to
long-term, would see full consolidation of the schemes under one management structures (NBP) and one
fund.

An Actuarial and Policy Analysis Unit has been established at the NBP, which is now undertaking
analysis for both, the SPF and the PSSD. The World Bank is providing significant support and capacity in
this area to the unit and to NBP and SPF management.

2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Government commitment. The government commitment to the operation has been strong throughout,
from design to defining the range and depth of the supported reforms. The Government actively
participated, and continues to do so in all major reform areas, the public financial management reforms,
the financial sector reforms and in the area social protection reforms (see also section 2.1). It needs to be
noted, however, that the Government operates in an unusual complex and difficult environment, security
and political wise, while still emerging from a conflict, and building democratic structures.

With the exception of the Kurdish north, the country‘s local, regional and national political institutions
are just emerging, and their portfolios of activities and objectives often overlap or are indistinct. Informal
and personal relationships define most of the country‘s significant political bargaining, conflict resolution
strategies and economic decision-making. Ministry directorates and regional governmental bodies, and
local governments lack the capacity to communicate with constituents or make a convincing case for their
relevance in the daily lives of residents. Accountability and transparency are notably absent.

The March 2010 elections, which followed the approval of this operation, had not resulted in a clear
majority for any of the main political blocs, and only after a long process of negotiations was the then
incumbent Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki able to establish a new coalition government, which at end
2011 appears to be seriously tested. The fractured political landscape and the many emerging immediate
needs and diverse and shifting interests, which needs to be taken into account makes it difficult for the
Iraqi government to decide on a coherent reform process and drive the process. Reforms in the area
tackled by this operation are by their nature cross-cutting and of a political economy content, which
require a form or core consensus among major parties and politicians or the dispense of a larger share of
political capital. It is difficult to argue that these conditions are met in Iraq at this time.

                                                     15
Nonetheless, it is remarkable to note, and it needs to be underlined in this context, the commitment and
active participation of the working level, including higher ranks of the Iraqi government administration
throughout this operation, despite all difficulties. The installation of the RTGS system would be a case in
point, with showed how working together across different lines is possible, if the issue is not politically
loaded and benefits (in this case efficiency gains) are equally distributed. The restructuring of the banking
sector, foremost the Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank, and its difficulties would show the opposite side,
and yet notable progress has been achieved, respectively has been possible.

Macroeconomic stability was maintained in 2010, despite a highly uncertain domestic and external
environment, but one with favorable oil price development. Iraq‘s export revenues exceeded
projections in 2010, with higher prices offsetting lower export volumes. Exports averaged 1.85 million
barrels per day (mbpd), well below the authorities‘ target of 2.10 mbpd. The shortfall reflected periods of
bad weather and attacks on pipelines, as well as the lack of an agreement with the Kurdish region to
secure additional exports. Export prices were substantially higher, however, averaging just over US$74
per barrel during the year, compared to a budgeted price of US$62.5 per barrel. Thus, oil export revenues
reached $50 billion in 2010, compared to a budget forecast of US$48 billion, and up from US$39 billion
in 2009, but still well below the peak level of US$63 billion in 2008.

The 2010 government budget deficit remained well below the original forecast. Notwithstanding the
somewhat higher oil revenues, this lower 2010 budget deficit reflects mainly a large under-execution of
the capital budget. The 2010 deficit amounted to about ID10 trillion (equivalent to 10 percent of GDP),
instead of the ID18 trillion that had been projected in the 2010 budget (19 percent of GDP). While some
under-execution of the capital budget had been expected given the prevailing constraints in administrative
capacity, the long delay in the formation of a new government appears to have contributed to a much
larger degree of under-execution.

Assessment of the operation’s design. The operation‘s design was based on a programmatic approach in
form of two operations of US$250 million10 each, following the request of the Government of Iraq and
given the anticipation of a new government emerging after the March 2010 elections, whose commitment
to the operation‘s reform program would have to be re-confirmed. The authorization to negotiate
mentions explicitly that ―the prior actions of the second DPL would be finalized with the new
Government based on the new Government's financing needs and progress on follow up reforms as shown
by compliance with the indicative triggers,‖ while avoiding to commit the new Government to detailed,
legally binding conditions, as requested. The successor DPL ultimately did not materialize, because the
financing need disappeared with the rise in international oil prices in 2010 and then especially in 2011. As
a result, the Government asked also the IMF in early-2011 to convert the Stand-By-Arrangement over
US$3.7 billion into a precautionary arrangement.

However, the complementary reform program supported by both institutions and operations remains as
valid today as at the time of approval. This operation has been critical in complementing the IMF‘s
supported program as much as it has been critical in forming and moving sector reform agendas and
making available to the policy dialogue a diverse World Bank competence in the relevant policy areas
while providing for equally strong incentives to coordinate on the Iraqi government‘s side.

     Decision note of the 2nd Operation Committee Meeting, December 1st, 2009.


                                                         16
The prior actions of the second DPL were closely based on analytical work (see below) or supported by
on-going, respectively newly launched investment and technical assistance projects in the operation‘s
policy areas; among them: the Public Finance Management Project, the Household Survey and Policies
for Poverty Reduction (HSPR) Project, the Banking Sector Reform Project supporting the Phase I of the
Iraq Banking Reform Strategy—Action Plan (2008-2012), the Emergency Social Protection Project
(ESPP), and the Pension Reform Implementation Support Technical Assistance (PRISTA).

The operational difficulty to continue with the 2nd operation in light of the lack of a financing need
undermined somewhat the policy dialogue and its momentum to drive progress but also deprived the
dialogue from an important anchor on both sides, the Government‘s as well as on the side of the World
Bank.

Relevance of risk identified. The main risks were adequately identified: political and economic
performance risks, oil revenue volatility risks, security risks, fiduciary risks, technical capacity risks, and
so called program risks. However the political economy risks were absent from the risk analysis,
especially with regard to the policy reforms targeted. Given the very fragile nature of the political fabric
in Iraq and the political sensitivity and cross cutting nature of most of the envisaged reforms, especially
with regard to the banking sector, the social protection system but also the procurement law, the operation
would have benefitted from an assessment of the political economy impact of these reforms.

The expected mitigating measure for the security risks, that the external financing—including through this
operation—would help the Government maintain its recurrent and investment spending and continue to
provide essential services to the population in a fragile and volatile environment, did not fully apply given
the under-execution of the 2010 budget, especially with regard to the public investment component.
Security risks of the scale as they are known in Iraq are also likely of a nature where this operation or the
World Bank in general cannot offer any effective mitigation. This would then be similar to the identified
fiduciary risks, which clearly were assessed as being non-mitigable at appraisal.

It is also not clear whether (i) the identified program risk (risk to the program), indeed, constitutes a risk
to this operation, and (ii) whether the chosen mitigating measure, the programmatic approach, is an
effective one. The program risk should have been better labeled sustainability risk as it tries to capture
rather the government‘s commitment to the reform program. If committed, the call for a second operation
might not be of immediate relevance. Concerning the mitigating measure, it turned out, the Government
did not ask for a second operation as the financing need did not arise. Whether designed (i) in a
programmatic mode or (ii) in 2 tranches appears to be irrelevant in this case.

Soundness of background analysis. The Bank had gained insight in the supported policy areas through
both formal Economic and Sector Work (ESW) as well as through its technical assistance program.
A Public Expenditure and Institutional Assessment (PEIA) (2008) provided an integrated assessment of
PFM performance, highlighting the main impediments for efficient public resource management, the
impact of PFM weaknesses and prospects for reform planning and implementation. The National Poverty
Reduction Strategy, which was informed by a Poverty Assessment (2009), is essentially a key for
improved alignment of budgetary allocations, particularly in the social sectors. The Operational
Procurement Review (OPR) of 2005 provided recommendations to the Iraqi Government that proposed to
address the uncertainty of public procurement laws and regulations and the scattered regulations creating
opportunities for corruption and substandard practices in public procurement. In the preparation of the
Banking Sector Reform Project, the Bank supported the Government in developing its Financial Sector
Strategy Action Plan 2008-2012, identifying the priority areas for the financial sector reform component
of this DPL backed up with independent audits and technical. The reforms of the food ration system and



                                                      17
the pension system were underpinned by various analytical assessments produced by the Bank which
informed the government policy.11

2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design

Program performance was to be evaluated based on 16 performance indicators, called ―program outcomes‖
(indicator) which were specified in the policy matrix (see above Tables 1, 3 and 4; and Annex 2). One
indicator was subdivided in 4 sub-indicators (public procurement). And 2 were equal to program triggers
for the envisaged 2nd DPL. 4 of the indicators were quantitatively expressed, 8 were referring to precise
action (or sub-action), which could be verified, and 4 are difficult to measure:

       -   “Continued strengthening of the link between policy and budget as revealed by pilot medium term
           financial planning in two ministries;?
       -   ―Rafidain and Rasheed banks diversify their activities beyond deposit taking and payment
           transactions, and play a more active role in financial intermediation,‖
       -    ―The banking system is largely adhering to the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
           Supervision;‖ and
       -   ―Key provisions of the new Unified Pension Law are implemented; including the discontinuation
           of labor force segmentation across public and private sectors.‖

The selected performance indicators are generally well-linked to the policy actions in the program matrix
as well as to the broader development objectives promoted by the operation. The performance indicators
were to be monitored jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank. The Ministry of Finance would
draw on the collaborating institutions, the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, Central
Bank of Iraq, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the Bank would contribute through the
DPL I supervision and the DPL II preparatory process. The government‘s own monitoring system was
poorly developed and at best emerging. Hence, the design of the monitoring and evaluation framework
combining government and bank contribution and using normal DPL supervision routine can be viewed
as appropriate given the context of the operation. It would have been preferable under these conditions to
design consistently verifiable program performance indicators.

Implementation

The program implementation is documented in DPL I Supervision Mission (September 2010) Aide-
Memoire; DPL II Pre-Appraisal Mission (November 2010) Aide-Memoire; and as well as in a Concept
Paper for the DPL II (October 2010). The DPL I supervision aide-memoire does not fully report on the
procurement law discussion (references to the regulatory agency and standard bidding documents are
missing), the progress made on the new charts of accounts, the 2006 Government accounts, nor the issues
surrounding the first annual progress report for the implementation of the National Poverty Reduction
Strategy, or the supervision component of the banking sector reform program, neither does the DPL II
concept paper. The aide-memoire of a DPL II pre-appraisal mission focuses exclusively on the DPL II
triggers. Monitoring reports from the government of Iraq are not available. The 2011 aide-memoires of
the specific sector missions (PFM, banking, and social protection) helped to fill the gap.

Utilization

The monitoring results and information gathered informs essentially about the preparation of the DPL II.
Monitoring after 2010 was overtaken by sector specific monitoring aligned with the relevant technical
assistance or investment project implementation without specific reference to the DPL I policy matrix.
Monitoring of the DPL I stopped essentially when the DPL II preparatory process stopped. It is unknown
how or if the Government of Iraq used the monitoring outcomes.

2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

Although the operation was designed as being programmatic based two operations, the economic situation
in Iraq improved significantly since 2009 with the rise in international oil prices and the rise in oil
production in Iraq so that there is no financing need which could justify the second operation under the
present DPL guidelines.


3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

The objectives of the operation was to mitigate the impact of the 2009 fiscal crisis on Iraq‘s economy and
to help the country improving fiscal sustainability and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic
vulnerability to sudden drops in oil revenues. In this regard, it should be noted that this operation was part
of a wider program that included an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), to support fiscal sustainability in
Iraq. In fact, the IMF was not prepared to proceed with its SBA in the absence of some burden sharing
arrangement with the Bank, which took the form of this DPL.

The relevance of this operation lies primarily in (i) providing a signal that the Iraqi government would not
be left to its own devices in the midst of a fiscal crisis striking at a critical political juncture; (ii) being
part of a large package of assistance in combination with the IMF program which promised to leverage a
sizeable amount (potentially US$3.7 billion) to the Iraqi budget; and (iii) providing support in policy
areas of the Government‘s reform program where the IMF could not deliver its assistance, and which
were highly complementary and relevant to the IMF‘s Stand-By Arrangement.

First, the Bank and the IMF, through this DPL and the SBA, respectively, stepped in at a time that Iraq‘s
fiscal troubles could have potentially degenerated into a deeper crisis with unpredictable macroeconomic
and political ramifications. Bank and Fund support, therefore, signaled that the international community
was prepared to support Iraq at a time when the crisis could have otherwise spiraled out of control. In
particular, by providing just-in-time budget support, this DPL and the SBA together contributed to
preventing further abrupt cuts in public spending in Iraq, which could have led to deeper social tensions in
an already highly-charged political situation, particularly in light of the then upcoming parliamentary
elections in March 2010. It could also be argued that Bank-Fund support helped the government sustain
its monetary policy stance, insofar as the authorities did not have to resort to the Central Bank‘s foreign
reserves to address Iraq‘s financing gap, thus preserving the exchange rate peg—the main component of
Iraq‘s successful disinflation process in the previous years. Over the course of 2010, Iraq‘s fiscal situation
started to improve on its own as oil prices started to rise again, which eventually led the Bank not to
proceed with a follow-up second DPL.


                                                      19
Second, as part of a broader package of support that included the IMF‘s Stand-By Arrangement, this
operation helped the Iraqi government maintain reasonable fiscal buffers—e,g., sufficiently large balances
in the account of the Development Fund for Iraq—which might have otherwise been depleted in the
absence of Bank-Fund support. At the same time, it should be noted that the direct impact on Iraq‘s fiscal
situation was limited by the size of the operation, which was the result of a decision at the corporate level
of the Bank. In fact, the operation amounted to US$250 million, or about 0.3 percent of the Iraqi GDP.
Given a public expenditure program in Iraq of about 85 percent of GDP in 2010, it is difficult to conclude
that the financial contribution would have been of direct significance for the Iraqi authorities to mitigate
the impact of the 2009 fiscal crisis on Iraq‘s economy. In fact, the authorities adjusted mostly by reducing
its investment program.

Third, the operation also contributed to furthering Iraq‘s goal of achieving and maintaining fiscal
sustainability and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability to sudden drops in oil revenues
through the reform program it supported, which complemented the IMF‘s SBA. The advances made in
the PFM area, while not complete, and maybe less advanced than planned, are nonetheless noticeable.
Similarly, the advances made in the banking sector are significant. The Rafidain and Rasheed bank have
passed a first restructuring and are widening their operations. Banking supervision has been strengthened.
The progress made in the social protection area is less visible at the time of this ICRR, although important
preparations were made and capacity has been build. The second part of the objective (fiscal sustainability
and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability) has been highly relevant and continues to be so
also today.

The overall design of two single-tranche DPLs (programmatic) building on a solid portfolio of investment
and technical assistance projects is a very classic approach which has been proven appropriate and
relevant in many cases, and which applies also in this case. In fact, the combination of the DPL and the
technical assistance work in PFM, the banking sector, and social protection has been key for the
operation‘s success. The fiscal sustainability focus was however foremost, although with good reasons,
on the expenditure side. It could have been useful, for reason of balance, but also for supporting more the
mitigating objective of the 2009 fiscal crisis, if a revenue measure could have been considered for this
operation.

Another question is whether the operation could have made use of the deferred drawdown option (DDO)
available to IBRD borrowers. In principle, such an option could have better accommodated the volatility
of Iraq‘s financing need, given the volatility of international prices, and maybe could have better bridged
the need for policy dialogue in the form of a development policy operation with the actual financing need.
However, the insurance-like nature of a DDO would not have been appropriate to the situation at hand
because the fiscal crisis was already underway.

The strategy of the Bank‘s assistance in Iraq is evolving at the time of writing this ICRR. The future focus
will likely be more on selectivity and building synergies, including with other donors. As an oil exporting
country, Iraq is subjected to financial volatility but evidently not to a permanent lack of own resources to
fund development. Although, the instrument of a DPL is typically not applied for middle income oil
exporting countries, the operation has shown that it can provide for a policy focus in a way investment
projects cannot, even in a difficult environment and even, if the country is financially well endowed and
under stress.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately satisfactory



                                                     20
Although the outcome objectives and indicators were set for two operations (and only one operation has
materialized) there have been progress and achievements in further reaching development objectives as
summarized in Tables 1, 3 and 4 above. The operation has been relatively successful with the reforms in
the PFM area and the banking sector. With regard to reforming the social safety net and the pension
system progress is noted but key elements of the reform are still not implemented (see also section 2.1
Program Performance for a detailed account).

Although the operation‘s development objective included “Helping bridge the financing gap created by
lower oil prices,? this objective was not further operationalized. For the purpose of this ICR, I assume
that this was meant to be achieved through (1) the financial contribution of this operation; and (2) as a
combined outcome of all implemented measures. Failure in meeting sub-components would therefore also
adversely affect this objective.

The objectives in the PFM are all advanced but some are not sufficiently advanced. The draft
procurement law was prepared in 2008 and submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval subsequent
to its review by the Shura Council in December 2009. However, the COM decided to consider the law in
the future in favor of a set of regulations to be issued by COM to provide flexibility to the line ministries,
even if technical advances have been made, including: (i) set up of public contracting directorate at MOP
responsible for coordination of government public contract policy for all ministries and public entities
including the issuance of implementing regulations and administrative instructions; (ii) issuance of
standard bidding documents; and (iii) designation of a contracting office to be responsible for the
contracting activities of the governmental units in most of the ministries. The Charts of Accounts are not
yet final in their approval; the first Annual Progress Report will soon be tackled (March/April 2012). A
medium-term fiscal framework has been established and is providing useful policy guidance for economic
planning, its effectiveness for supporting poverty reduction expenditure in the context of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy is still hampered in the absence of approved Charts of Accounts, which makes
effective monitoring of such expenditures difficult.

The banking sector reforms have been the fairly successful, judged by the pre-defined outcome indicators.
The settlement of non-performing loans (NPLs) of Rafidain and Rasheed Banks, as per the status of June
2007, has been achieved, although more NPLs were identified in the process, which are not yet settled.
The provision level has been significantly increased, while equity has been build, and the diversification
has set in (mortgage market, Islamic Banking). The efficiency of the banking sector could be enhanced
(RTGS). Banking supervision has improved, but the adherence to Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision could not be verified as the outcome indicator, as formulated, did not allow for such.

Efficiency gains in the social protection system have been achieved on the margin (exclusion of higher
incomes groups from the PDS) but the core reforms (rationalization of the PDS system and unification of
the two pension funds, including to eliminate discrimination in the labor market) could only be advanced,
among others through launching an actuarial study, but have not yet been concluded.

The development outcomes were mostly well linked to the policy actions proposed by the DPL. A good
example of this would be (i) PFM measure to establish a High Level Committee for implementing new
Charts of Accounts or (ii) the measure of the banking sector reforms asking to settle a certain amount of
NPLs as per the 2007 status. The practical intent of these measures was to (i) reduce the time fiscal
accounts are produced (within 60 days); and (ii) settle a significant amount of NPLs. The measures were
taken and, indeed, effective in (i) producing information on budget outcomes on time, thereby
strengthening fiscal management and ultimately contributing to fiscal sustainability through a more
effective use of fiscal resources, and (ii) in (a) allowing for fiscal space as the two large banks relied less
on fiscal resources and (b) their improved operations and initiated diversification contributes to the
formation of a private sector and subsequently to a diversification of revenues. The link between the

                                                      21
procurement law reform and its outcome is not completely clear although the outcomes are issues referred
to in the law. Some of the suggested outcomes are complex reforms by itself, like the creation of a Public
Procurement Regulatory Agency or the reorganization of the ministerial procurement function in line with
the law. They all depend on an approved procurement law which is typically not a forgone presumption,
less so for two single-tranche DPLs.

The indicators for the development outcomes are not of a particularly high order and their impact on the
broader development objectives is mostly relatively indirect. This applies the more as this DPL turned out
to be only one single-tranche DPL with a time horizon of formally only one year. It would be unrealistic
to expect, within this short period, significant changes in higher order development outcomes.

In addition, some of the indicators have been specified in ways which makes measurement difficult, if not
impossible (see also Section 2.3, Design). An example would be the indicators (a) measuring the
―…adherence for the Basle Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision,‖ or (b) ―Key Provisions of
the Unified Pension Law are implemented...‖ With no benchmarks specified it is impossible to determine
whether the indicator has been achieved or not.

Of the sixteen development indicators specified, 3 of the 7 PFM outcome indicators (the one for
procurement is broken down in 4 sub-indicators) have not been met, one of the 5 banking sector reform
indicators has not been met, and 2 of the 4 indicators for the reform of the social protection system have
not been met, or only partly (see also the 3 tables in Section 2.1). Information on the actual performance
could be found for all indicators.

3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

With the achievement of program objectives being moderately satisfactorily, while the relevance of
objectives, design, and implementation are rated satisfactorily, the overall rating of Moderately
Satisfactory is indicated. Achieving of program objectives is rated higher than the relevance of objectives,
design, and implementation.

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not known, N/A

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Little institutional change could be achieved with the limited advances of this single tranche operation.
The procurement reform and the status quo of the two pension funds are not yet completed. Concerning
the latter, the National Pension Board (NPD) has been established and is operating, but its impact as an
institution remains undermined and largely technical in the absence of the unification of the two pension
systems.

However, it needs to be noted that a wide array of capacity building activities in parallel to this operation
has helped to lay the ground for (1) strengthened institutions (PFM area, banking sector, especially the
Iraq Central Bank and its banking supervision department, and the NPB); and (2) the combination of
capacity built and the reforms initiated are likely to sustain some of the institution building momentum,


                                                     22
especially the PRS process and its link with the medium term budget framework as well as strengthened
banking supervision which will positively impact on the next steps of the banking reform.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

This rating results (i) from the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the political, security, and
economic trends in Iraq, and (ii) the promising but limited progress achieved so far under this operation.
The fragility of the political process in Iraq became evident once again in late-2011 when the Prime
Minister issued a warrant for the Vice Prime-Minister, following a bomb explosion in Bagdad. It is not
clear, how the political consensus or critical political momentum for the procurement reform, the Charts
of Accounts reform, a further restructuring of the Rasheed and Rafidain Banks to disentangle them from
their quasi fiscal role, or the unification of the pension fund system, can be achieved or tackled in an
environment where apparently security considerations still prevail over a policy discourse, however
complex, creating political consent might be by itself.

International oil prices are estimated to remain at the level of US$100 a barrel for the next years. In
parallel, Iraq is expanding massively its production. In 2015, production might well have quintupled
compared to the 1.8 million barrel a day of 2010, but certainly doubled by then. The likely massive
corresponding increase in oil revenues over the next years does not provide for financial incentives to
continue the reforms. However, the demand for reforms might well be strong enough and also increase, if
wasteful use of public resources should become more evident in light of the enhanced availability of
financial space.

A mitigating factor for the risks to the development outcomes is that project support (technical assistance
and investment) in the three policy areas (PFM, financial sector, social protection) continues to be offered.
At the time of this evaluation, technical assistance and investment operation supported by the Bank or
other partners, in the three main policy areas supported by the loan, are judged to have been critical in
bringing the reforms process thus far, even if implementation is lagging behind. The leverage of the
dialogue through an IMF Stand-by arrangement has had a positive and encouraging impact. The
experience with installing the RTGS as part of the Iraqi financial sector reforms demonstrated that
technical reforms can be moved, and rather quickly and effectively.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory


                                                    23
This rating focuses exclusively on the DPL itself, and not on the Bank‘s overall stance towards Iraq,
which would be subject to other evaluations. The rating reflects a balance between mostly positive factors
and some weaknesses in the design of an M&E system. The positive factors were: (i) the exceptionally
close link between the World Bank‘s analytic and technical work, particularly in the PFM area with the
Iraq Public Finance Management Project; in the financial sector reform area with the Iraq Financial
Sector Review plus earlier analytical work, and the Banking Sector Reform Project as well as the Second
Institutional Capacity Building project; (ii) the close linkages between the pillars of the DPL and the goals
of the Interim Strategy Note; and (iii) the technical assistance projects in support of the reforms of public
financial management, financial sector, the Iraq Public Distribution System, for undertaking the
household survey as well as for strengthening poverty reduction policies and its monitoring, and for the
pension system reform.

The quality of the analytic and technical assistance work is evident in that it served as an analytic basis
for the subsequently planned second operation, the DPL II.

Furthermore, the complementarity of this DPL to the Stand-By Arrangement implemented in parallel by
the IMF did not only add financial resources, which were of lesser importance in this case given the
DPL‘s volume, but added in particular policy advice, policy dialogue, and technical assistance and
investment where the Stand-By arrangements of the IMF could not become active, or did not have the
competence. Both operations were mutually supportive of each other.

The quality at entry for this operation was supported by intense engagement by Senior Management, the
corporate departments in the Bank, and different parts of the MENA Region. All in all, the final design
was the result of a careful process that involved different areas—corporate and operational—of the Bank
as a whole. For example, two formal Operations Committee meetings, chaired by a Managing Director,
were held before authorization to appraise this DPL was granted.

While the M&E framework and design set out in the operation was broadly appropriate in light of the
circumstances, it also had weaknesses. Whereas the use of relatively lower order outcomes as indicators is
understandable given the short duration of the operation, the quality of the indicators chosen could have
been more considered to facilitate close supervision in a fragile environment. Two of them were really
output rather than outcome indicators, and several others were difficult to measure systematically,
respectively not sufficiently broken down in measurable elements, mitigating their usefulness for
assessing project performance.

The project document also notes in paragraph 194 that ―the fiduciary risk cannot be mitigated.‖ This
sentence was introduced at the request of the Bank‘s Controller‘s Office, although the team spent
considerable efforts to consider mitigation measures (paragraph 195). This indicates that the fiduciary risk
must have been high at entry.

The combination of the high quality of the analytic work, intense engagement by Senior Management and
corporate departments, the close links with the ISN, the framework provided by the accompanying
technical assistance projects supporting each pillar of the operation, and the close cooperation with
partners, particularly with the IMF, suggest that an overall rating of satisfactory is indicated, even though
the M&E design could have been more up to the task.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As is typical with DPLs, supervision focused primarily on progress towards meeting disbursement
conditions (see also 2.3). Taking this into account, potential problems, e.g., the lack of progress in the

                                                      24
procurement area and in the social safety net area were identified relatively early and the evidence
suggests that the Bank‘s early engagement led to re-dynamization of Government efforts. During the
supervision mission of September 2010, the Government was reminded of areas in which further progress
was needed (especially concerning the procurement reforms) with the result that, the measures for the
second DPL were met roughly within the envisaged time frame of the project, except for the budget 2011
as a cross- cutting measure for the macroeconomic policy reassurance for a DPL. This progress was
noteworthy given that the formal supervision mission was in September 2010 and the pre-appraisal for the
DPL II took place in late November 2010. This is remarkable, given the political stress the country went
through to form a new government after the elections of March 2010.

Supervision was hampered by the absence of an Iraqi monitoring system, although the team at the
Ministry of Finance was very engaged in facilitating proper supervision. An improved and more adequate
monitoring framework, with more details concerning progress made, could have made easier the
supervision task for both sides.

The supervision generated an ample amount of information on the operation‘s implementation status,
which was documented in form of aide-memoires and other reports, however, an ISR was not filed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The ratings of satisfactory on the dimension Quality at Entry and moderately satisfactory on supervision
translate into an overall rating of moderately satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government was actively engaged in the design of the operation, setting clear limits as to what would
be acceptable, while setting ambitious objectives. The government was, however, not in the position to
generate the political support in the fragmented political landscape in Iraq which would have been
required to move key pillars of the reform as envisaged (procurement reform, social protection system).
On the latter, the government has just announced through media (AK news of 22 January 2012) that a
decrease of the PDS beneficiaries, based on better targeting, will begin in 2014.

Although the Bank and other partners are helping the government to develop a monitoring policy and
develop indicators for policy monitoring, the monitoring in place did not go beyond the ad-hoc and was
much limited to the Ministry of Finance and some institutions under its auspices.

Considering the many problems and challenges the government and its administration was dealing with
during the implementation period, especially the prolonged process to form a new government and
creating workable alliances, the overall performance is still remarkable.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                   25
The implementing agency was the Ministry of Finance, which is the chief Government interlocutor with
donors on budget support operations, including any IMF program.12 Most of the actions envisioned under
the program were centered on the Ministry of Finance but involved broad coordination with other
Ministries and government entities, making coordination very demanding, especially given the fractured
politics in Iraq. In spite of this complexity, the Government was able to meet a larger part of the measures
set to trigger the second operation, except for the procurement law, the reform of the PDS system, and the
pension system, where nonetheless progress has been made and achieving these triggers is within reach.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This is a direct result of the rating of moderately satisfactory for the Government and moderately
satisfactory for the implementing agency performance.


6.         Lessons Learned

This operation confirmed the importance of linking the Development Policy Lending with (a) solid
analytical work and (b) with investment and technical assistance operations, especially in the fragile
environment applicable in Iraq. Both applied in this case, and have been a key requirement for the relative
success of this operation.

The conflict situation and fragile policy environment in Iraq makes almost any operation a high risk
operation in terms of achieving its outcomes. This operation assumed risks, especially fiduciary risks but
also substantial ―program‖ risks. It has been important to assume these risks to achieve the progress made,
even if this judgment will be contentious. As the ―Lesson Learned‖ section of the project document states
(paragraph 131), risks should, however be mitigated. A proper analysis of risk mitigation options is
important and could lead in the process to possible adjustments of the overall operations, making the
overall undertaking more successful, as risks and risks mitigation strategies or options would have been
clarified.

There is a need to be realistic in countries facing conflict and a fragile situation like in Iraq. The
encompassing procurement and the social safety net reform envisaged by this operation within more or
less one year would have been very ambitious under normal circumstances. Realism would need to be
translated into a more step-by-step reform approach, a more gradual or incremental reform process, which
by itself could also lead to the definition of more precise (and realistic) outcome indicators. This seems
also to be in line with the lessons learned as expressed in the project document.

Another way to become more realistic in situations like the one in Iraq would be to make more active use
of political economy analysis especially concerning the largest reform elements. Politics is always
dominant in fragile situations and institutions, by definition, underperform. It is therefore not only
important to know what constitutes good or better policies in a given situation, but it is also important to
know about what range of reform is feasible in a given time period, and how the incentives for reform are
distributed. This would positively impact the risk assessment as well as inform the operation‘s design.

It must have been difficult to monitor or supervise this operation in the given Iraqi environment where a
proper monitoring environment does not yet exist, and collaboration across institutions is difficult, among
others because of the fragmented political situation. In such a situation more reliance is then on the

operation‘s own monitoring framework and its design. It is therefore recommended to critically assess the
monitoring framework and outcome indicators as well as the monitoring design for future operations in
light of the weak country system. It would also have been recommendable to agree on a verifiable
monitoring arrangement for the main implementation agency.

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

Borrower comments were requested but are not available.

(b) Cofinanciers

N/A

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

The Bank team worked in partnership with the IMF team under the parallel programs, World Bank
Development Policy Loan and the IMF Stand-By Arrangement. The operation was part of a broader
support package that included an International Monetary Fund Stand-by Arrangement with a total amount
of US$3.7 billion. About US$1.7 billion have been released by the IMF in a total of 3 disbursements. The
policy matrix used by the Bank has been different from the one used by the IMF but the measures
supported and monitored were complementary. Disbursement decisions were made individually.

Staff from both the Bank and the Fund participated in the design of the operation‘s policy matrix, which
defined the DPL program. There was appreciation that the Bank was prepared to include in the matrix
areas in which the Fund had a strong interest. The resulting policy matrix summarized appropriately the
collective priorities.

The IMF counterparts regarded the World Bank‘s involvement as positive and felt that the engagement by
the team had been constructive and collaborative. The IMF also participated or added to the supervision
of the project. There was one formal supervision mission of the project, in September 2010.

Furthermore, the complementarity of this DPL to the in parallel implemented Stand-By arrangement by
the IMF did not only add financial resources, which were of lesser importance in this case given the
DPL‘s volume, but added in particular policy advice, policy dialogue, and technical assistance and
investment where the Stand-By arrangements of the IMF could not become active, or did not have the
competence. Both operations were mutually supportive of each other.
