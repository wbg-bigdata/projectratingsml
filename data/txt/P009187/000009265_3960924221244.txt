(OAN 178YU)
EVWAUIAON SUMMAR
i.          The Croatia Sava Drainage Project was the ninth Bank loan for
agriculture in Yugoslavia, with a loan amount of US$ 51.0 million. The Bank's
strategy in the agriculture sector at the time was to support development of
less developed regions and promote agricultural development in both the
individual and social sectors through the provision of basic infrastructure
and credit. Severe flooding of the Sava River Basin in the 1960's underlined
the pressing need for the protection of this area from floods, and a master
plan was developed by Government to start a first phase of action which
included flood protection and drainage of the middle portion of the riveri
basin. Preparation of the project took place between 1976 and 1978, and the
Loan was approved in October, 1979.
ii.         The main objectives of the project were to:  (a) assist in the
development of the Sava River Basin, which suffered from flooding by external
ataer flowing down from adjoining sub-mountainous areas and waterlogging due
to lack of drainage, by financing investments in drainage infrastructure and
on-farm development; (b) increase land and labor productivity and rural
incomes in the project area through drainage, land consolidation, and on-farm
development; and, (c) increase production of wheat, maize, rape seed, and
livestock products primarily for the domestic market to promote self-
sufficiency.
iii.        Zagrebbacka Banka (ZB) was the borrower under the guarantee of the
Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, and was also responsible for credit under
the on-farm development component.  The Sava River Authority, known as OVP14,
the water resource management agency for the Sava River Basin, was responsible
for the implementation and overall coordination of the project.
iv.         The project got off to a slow start, due to lack of sufficient
advance planning and design, and delays in the preparation of bidding
documents. The elapsed implementation time was close to the original
estimate. However, completion was 1-1/2 years behind that estimated at
appraisal. Actual quantities of major project works exceeded the original

estimates due to design changes, and three additional pumping stations were
constructed. Targets were also exceeded in land. clearing and leveling.
v.          Actual project cost amounted to US$ 119.3 million (Yug.Din. 15,347
million), comp r d to US$ 132.6 million (Yug.Din. 2,390 million) estimated at
appraisal.  The exchange rate at the time of appraisal was Din. 18, and had
risen to Din. 379 at the end of the implementation period.
vt.         Total agricultural area under the project was increased from
44.000 ha. to 46,000 ha., and arable land from 40,000 ha. to 46,000 ha. LanD
consolidation wa a success, reducing by one-third the number of cadastral
units. Credit demand for on-farm activities related to drainage, such as land
levelling, clearing, and sub-surface drainage, reached appraisal estimates.
However, demand for farm machinery and credit for livestock production fell
short, because of the lack of assistance from ZB and extensionists in
identifying appropriate investments, and lack of flexibility in the loan
agreeent to accourodate new investment needs. Institutions, such as OVP and
the local SVIZs (Self-managed Water Economy Interest Communities) were
str ngthened, as was thne extension system and the Institute for Plant
Broeding, Zagreb.
vii.        Based on 1986 production figures, it is estimated that an ERR of
82 will be reached. This compares to 171 estimated at appraisal. Crop yields
have exceeded pre-project levels, but have not reached appraisal estimates in
all cases. Cropped area has reached appraisal estimates. The main reasons
for the shortfall in the ERR are: (a) expected incres"es in livestock
production have not materialized, and in fact, production has decreased in the
ara, ainly due to the low controlled producer prices; (b) benefits have
materialized at a slower rate than was envisaged at appraisal: and (c) higher
than projected project costs relative to returns.
viii.       Several features of the project are sustainable and have already
contributed to agriculture development in Yugoslavia:
(a)  The design of the drainage system was the first of its kind in the
Republic, and become a model for subsequent drainage projects.
(b)  Land consolidation, although slow to start, proved to be
successful and made a contribution to the efficiency of production in the
project area.
(c) Project entities were strengthened and continue to function in an
enhanced manner, due to the project.
(d)  The cost recovery system, though fragmented, is collecting
sufficient revenues to cover operation and maintenance, but not capital costs.



v 
ix.         The lessons learned from the project can be summarized as follows:
(a)   A more realistic implementatLon schedule should have been
formulated taking into account the time needed for advance
preparation by the Borrower, and the magnitude and complexity of
the works to be carried out by force account.
(b)   Although the cost recovery system is functioning and water charges
are sufficient to cover operation and maintenance, the Bank
provided very little input into the design and lmplementation of
the system. There was no loan covenant concerning cost recovery.
More time should be spent by the Bank to assist the Borrower in
this critical aspect of any irrigation/drainage project.
(c)   Adjustments in the program of on-farm credit were not made during
the project period to tailor the component to current farmer
needs. Also, the ability of ZB and the extension service to
administer this component was overestimated and led to delays in
the implementation of this component.
(d) The estimates of project benefits should be based on realistic
expectations. In estimating project benefits at appraisal, the
effect of price controls on production, in this case the
production of meat and milk, were grossly underestimated.
Production of these commodities has actually decreased over the
life of the project due to lack of farmer incentives. (At
appraisal, meat and milk production constituted one-third of
project benefits.) in addition, both crop and livestock
production was expected to reach full development in three years
after completion of the project works, an optimistic estimate.

Background DMat
1.01        The agricultural sector, including agroindustries, contributes
19-20X of Yugoslavia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1986, and about 10-13X
of total exports, and engages 301 of the labot force.f Primary agriculture,
excluding agroindustries, contributes about 152 of GDP. Over the past decade
or more, while agriculture's contribution to GDP has been relatively stable,
shifts in the labor force away from agriculture have been rapid.
Agriculture's share of the labor force has declined to 30X in 1986 from 481 in
1971. The social sector controls 17Z of agricultural land and produces 281 of
the agricultural output. It includes government enterprises and public
institutions. The individual sector, comprising individual farmers and
cooperatives,Z receives support from various forms o. cooperation with the
social sector.
1.02        The project area is located in the Sava River Basin, southeast of
Zagreb, a relatively flat plain with some low hills interspersed with small
valleys. The climate is described as 'moderate continental', with an average
annual rainfall of 920 mm, usually well-distributed throughout the year.
Agricultural produccion is based on rainfed agriculture with the dominant
crops being maize, wheat, and rapeseed. Because of drainage problems, much of
the land was previously used for grazing and the production of hay. About 451
of the inhabitants are classified as farmers.
The PL 
1.03        Out of the flood affected area of 1.2 million ha in the Sava River
Basin, 44,000 ha were to be reclaimed under the project by both surface and
subsurface drainage. Field observations on ground water behavior and soil
structure suggested the need for subsurface drainage for which detailed
investigation and studies were necessary. The objective was to design an
effective least-cost drainage system. This objective has been successfully
accomplished through the construction of major canals to intercept external
water, internal surface drainage, pumping stations, .nd on-farm development.
This project, the first of the kind in the Republic of Croatia, became a model
for subsequent drainage projects in this River Basin.

1.04        Zagrebbacka Bank (ZB) was the borrower for the Bank loan under the
guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia. In addition to on-lending
the Bank loan to the project implomenting agency, it was also responsible for
directly implementing on-farm development sub-loans. The Sava River
Authority. OVPU, the water resource management agency for the Sava River
Basin, was responsible for the implementation and overall coordinatlon of the

1.05        The Bank loan of US$ 51.0 milllon financed 55S of the project
cost. The remaLning 46S was financed by ZB (192), the Road Compensation Fund
(191), and by on-farm development credit subborrowers (71).
Bank Role In the Sector
1.06        The Croatia Sava Drainage Project was the eighth Bank operation to
support Yugoslavia's agricultural sector. This loan for US$ 51.0 million
brought lending for agriculture and agroindustries to US$ 394 million by 1979,
which amounted to nearly one-fifth of the Bank's total commitments to
Yugoslavia at the time. The Republic of Croatia had previously participated
in two countrywide agricultural credit projects. However, this was the first
agricultural loan limited to thls Republic.
1.07        The Bank's strategy in the agricultural sector was to support
development of less developed regions and promote agricultural development in
both the individual and social sectors through providing basic infrastructure
and credit. Development of the agricultural sector was considered essential
to address the problems of rural poverty underlying regional disparity,
provide gainful employment to rural population, reduce iLports and increase
exports. In general, the Bank effort was to expand its support to strengthen
the individual sector in primary production, while meeting vital marketing and
processing requirements through the social sector.

I. PRDJECT FORMULATION AND PROCESSING
2.01        Severe flooding of the town of Zagreb in 1964 followed by flood
damages in 1965 and 1966 in the Sava River Basin brought to the fore the
pressing need for the protection of this area fro.u floods. A specialized
organization, OVP, was created in that same year. Thereafter the UN was
approached by the Federal Government of Yugoslavia for technical assistance,
and with local authorities and experts, completed a study (Regulation and
Management of the Sava River) in 1972, which proposed a phased water
management plan until the year 2000. Works done in the interim included dikes
along the Sava, canals, culverts, bridges, and pumping stations. Following
the phased master plan, the Croatian legislative body decided in 1977 to start
the first phase which included the flood protection and drainage of the middle
portion of Sava River Basin.
Pr£RarUmn
2.02        Between September 1976 and March 1978 five Bank missions, two
combined Bank-FAO/CP missions, and one FAO/CP mission provided guidance and
assistance in project preparation. A preparation report was submitted to the
Bank by OVP in February 1978. Some important technical changes introduced by
Bank missions included the elimination of subsoiling, the use of liming and
moling, and the establishment of extension services.
2.03        The appraisal of the project was completed in October/November
1978. The appraisal mission made a comprehensive review of the feasibility
study, paying special attention to the proposed design for both surface and
subsurface drainage works, project cost and on-farm development credit. Some
of the major issues that were considered at the time of appraisal were:
(a) Effectiveness and costs of different drainage methods;
(b)   How practical and successful the proposed land consolidation
measures would be in the project area; and
(c) A plan for organization and management of the project including
the availability and strengthening of supporting services to the
beneficiary farmers such as agricultural extension and training,
supply of improved seeds and fertilizers, production credit, farm
machinery and marketing arrangements.
The importance of continued investigations of soil properties, groundwater
behavior, and drain performance, especially for subsurface drains, were
highlighted by the mission.

2.04        The major issues addressed during project processing included:
(1)   On-lending interest rates - 7X for infrastructure investments and
82 for on-farm credit were recommended pending the completion of
an on-going interest rate study.
(2) Procurement - force account was recommended for the major
infrastructure works.
(3)   Financing Arrangements - written on-lending agreements between ZB
and the 11 project beneficiaries were to be made a condition of
Board presentation.
Hoggns
2.05        Negotiations were held in Washington from May 30 to June 7, 1979,
between the Yugoslavian delegation led by Mr. Marijan Strbasic, Secretary of
Agriculture and Forestry of SR Croatia, and the Bank representatives. Points
agreed upon at negotiations included a change in on-lending terms to 9X plus
21 for on-farm development and .52 above the Bank lending rate for
infrastructure. At negotiations, the issue of foreign exchange risk was
discussed, but a decision was deferred pending further discussion with Bank
Senior Management. The decision was finally taken that for sub-borrowers in
the individual sub-sector, Government would bear the risk, and in the social
sub-sector, the sub-borrower would bear the risk.
Board Presentation and Loan Effectlvenm
2.06        The project was approved by the Board on September 4, 1979 and the
loan documents were signed on October 11, 1979. The presentation made to the
Board lent special emphasis to the objectives of the project (para. 2.07), the
first drainage project in Yugoslavia financed by the Bank. A question was
raised as to why an analysis of Zagrebacka Banka was not included. The answer
was given that the project was essentially an infrastructure one, that ZB had
been scrutinized under the First and Second Agricultural Credit Projects
(Loans 1129-YU and 1477-YU), and that the institution was found to be sound.
The closing date was fixed as June 30, 1985, with project completion date as
December 31, 1984. After approval of the loan, the deadline for loan
effectiveness, originally anticipated by January 31, 1980, was extended to
March 31, 1980, because of delays in complying with the conditions for
effectiveness, including the drafting of the subsidiary loan agreements in
particular. The loan finally became effective on April 17, 1980.
Protect Oblectives and Description
2.07        The main objectives of the project were to:  (a) assist in the
development of the Sava River Basin, which suffered from flooding by external
water and water logging due to lack of drainage, by financing investments in
drainage infrastructure and on-farm development; (b) through drainage, land
consolidation and on-farm development increase land and labor productivity and
income of rural population in the project area to levels approaching averages



of regions without drainage problems; and (c) increase production of wheat,
maize, rapeseed and livestock products such as meat and milk primarily for the
domestic market to better achieve self-sufficiency in agricultural products.
2.08        The main components of the project were:
(a)   ProlM Wok:
(i)   Seven major channels covering 220 km with embankments to
intercept external water coming from higher elevations, with
bottom width varying from 2 to 4 m and depth up to 4 m;
(ii)   Internal surface drainage consisting of 1620 km parallel
open drains spaced 300 m apart with 325 km collecting drains
up to 2.5 m deep in all arable lands;
(iii)   Eight pumping stations to lift water from the collecting
drains and discharge to outlet channels when gravity flow is
not possitble, and;
(iv)   Other auxiliary structures such as bridges, culverts and
dirt roads along the drains.
(b)   Onfann Development CredR:
Mi)   Medium- and long-term credits were to be provided for land
improvement including subsurface drains, livestock
development, and farm machinery: Individual farm sector
investments were estimated to benefit 1500 farms (average
farm size 5 ha) out of 5200, farming a total area of 25,500
ha, and;
(ii)   Social sector on-farm credit investment was to be provided
for land clearing, levelling and subsurface drainage for
12,300 ha, farm machinery consisting of tractors, combines
with implements and four new farmyards, macadam and gravel
access roads.
(c)   Eaulpmnrl. Construction and O&  equipment, vehicles, office and
laboratory equipment.
(d)   Consultants and Tralning Abrad. Local and foreign consultants to
conduct investigations for drainage works, review drainage design,
analyze data on groundwater monitoring after construction, and
assist in the establishment of an effective extension service.
(e)   Management and Technical Servces including project funds for
administration, land consolidation, technical design, extension
service and project monitoring.

M1. PROJECT IMPEMMENTATION
Staft-UR
3.01        The actual construction of the project works started around
mid-1981 after a slow start in preparing the documentation for the procurement
of construction equipment. The purchase of spares for existing equipment was
allowed, and some work was started by force account in 1980. Land
consolidation on 3,500 ha had been completed by mid-1980, and progress was
being made in another 8,500 ha. VRO hired the same consulting firm that had
done the Basin study in the 1970's for investigations, design review, and for
monitoring of subsurface drainage, with the Bank assisting in the writing of
their terms-of-reference.
Physical lmglementaton
3.02        At appraisal, the estimated time for implementation was 4-1/2
years from April 1980 to December 1984. In spite of initial delays, the
project was completed in June 1986, which was 1-1/2 years beyond the original
completion date (December 1984), but very close to the estimated
implementation time.
3.03        Annex 1, Table 1 shows the planned and actual quantities of major
project works. Actual quantities exceed the original estimate due to design
changes and increased volume of work, especially for excavation and structures
on the main intercepter canals. There were also increases in land clearing
and land levelling quantities. An additional three pumping stations also
increased the volume of civil works construction.
wrocuremnnt
3.04        Procurement of equipment included drainage works and related
equipment, office and field equipment, and farm equipment. Bank ICB
guidelines were followed for the imported equipment, and there were no local
bidders. Some adjustments were made in the maintenance and farm equipment and
eight pumping stations. Annex 1, Table 2 indicates that construction,
maintenance and office equipment worth Din. 480 million were purchased against
the planned value of Din. 162 million. Farm equipment worth Din. 529 million
was procured for the social sector through ICB (Annex 1, Table 3). This value
exceeded the planned estimate of Din. 173 million;
.3.05        Construction of civil works was mostly by force account since OVP
had the construction capability and the manpower. Contracts were allotted to
5 BOALSY, which also employed subcontractors depending upon the urgency and
type of work. This system was seen to be the most appropriate choice as there
was no response from foreign contractors through ICB, and local bidders turned

out to be more expensive than the force account work. The project unit of VRO
coordinated and monitored the performance of the work.
3.09        The actual cost of the project in dollar terms was US$ 119.3
million compared with US$ 132.6 million estimated at appraisal, a decrease of
10. Actual cost in dinars rose from a projected Din. 2,626 million estimated
at appraisal to the actual expenditure of Din. 15,347 million, or 5.8 times
the expected value. The exchange rate, which was Din. 18 at the time of
appraisal had risen to Din. 379 by the end of the implementation period.

remaining 61X was to be financed by ZB (41X) and by on-farm development credit
subborrowers, by SIZs, OVP and others, or Communes (20X). Due to increased
[the excesses in the actual] foreign exchange requirements, changes in
disbursement percentages and reallocation of Loan proceeds in Schedule 1 of
the Loan Agreement were approved in January 1986 and, as a result, the Bank's
share of selected expenditures to be financed increased to 70X. The actual

3.08        The borrower complied with all loan covenants and with the
provisions of six subsidiary loan agreements. The principal covenants dealt
with the financing procedures, procurement procedures, subloan appraising
criteria, interest rates, foreign exchange risk arrangements, employment of
consultants for drainage studies, land consolidation, strengthening OVP staff,
investigations and the monitoring program for subsurface drainage. There was
no covenant concerning cost recovery.
3.09        The Bank loan of JS$ 51 million was to be disbursed in five years
(1980 to 1985) in accordance with the amendment to the loan agreement dated
January 9, 1986. Works executed by force account were disbursed against
certificates of expenditure and supporting documentation was made available
for inspection to the Bank's supervision missions, while all other
expenditures under the loan were fully documented and submitted to the Bank
along with withdrawal applications. Actual disbursement started about two
years later than anticipated and the actual quarterly disbursements were
slower than estimated. The final disbursement was on April 30, 1987, as the
loan account w.'s kept open to honor commitments made before the loan closing
date. US$ 49.735 million of the Loan was disbursed, and the balance of $1.265
million was cancelled on May 21, 1987. A comparison of actual and estimated
disbursements is shown in Annex 3, Table 1. Loan agreement categories and
amounts actually disbursed are shown in Annex 3, Table 2.

4.01        Land consolidation involved 47,625 ha and 26,559 land owners.  The
total number of cadastral units which was 175,455 before the project was
reduced to 55,985 by land consolidation (about 1/3 of the original number).
For implementing this work, air photos and photo maps at the scale of 1:2000,
1:1000 and 1:500 were made. Cadastral plans at 1:2000 were prepared as the
earlier maps were 100 years old and obsolete.  The land consolidation act of
1979 helped accelerate the work although it was slow in the first two years.
Land holdings are now clearly defined and a geodetic network is established
for ready reference.

4.02        P. tmUon omFooding  To protect the project area from flooding
caused by annual rainfall (920 mm) in the catchment, the project area was
divided into nine catchments drained by nine lateral canals with bed width
varying from 15 to 30 m and depth up to 4 m, total length 58 km involving
about 1.45 million in of earthwork and 33 structures. In addition, the
capacity of existing natural streams Crnec, Zelina and Lonja was enlarged to a
25 year return period of rainfall runoff. This involved about 1.6 million Un
of earthwork in a length of 43 km and 17 new structures.  These measures have
been successful in protecting the area from flooding by external waters.
4.03        Sudace Draligns. As planned in the appraisal report, the design
parameters were unchanged and involved about 576 km of open field drains 300 m
apart and collector drains with a depth of 2.5 m, and about 1180 km of
detailed tertiary and quarternary drainage channels.
4.04        Pumpng Stlonat  To drain the water from the open drainage canals,
eight pumping stations were originally planned to lift water and discharge
into outlet channels when gravity flow is not possible. Actually, 11 new such
pumping stations had to be built at suitable locations equipped with 59.5
nP/sec capacity and one existing pump of 1 ma capacity.  The planned cost per
n?/sec, which included access road and power lines, was 3.88 million dinars.
The actual cost has been 10.8 million dinars. The increased cost has been due
to changes in design of the reinforced concrete foundations and higher
imported price of equipment procured through ICB.
4.05        Subsurface Dralnage. In the social sector, about 12,740 ha were
provided with perforated pipe subsurface drainage using modern trenching and
pipe.laying machines.  The design parameters were fixed after disctssions
between the Consultants (ILACO), Yugoslavs and the Bank experts, who decided
to use gravel filter only on heavy soils, which represent 10 of the total
area, the remaining extremely heavy clays, not requiring gravel filter, have

been earth-filled. The work inmolved about 6,400 km of subsurface drains and
1150 structures. The parameters for surface drainage were determined by field
experiments conducted in three 20 ha pilot farms, located in different soil
types over a period of five years.
On-fomn Deve u mernWok
4.06        The Loan Agreement provided for various kinds of subloans to be
made to the subborrowers in both the individual and social sectors.
Individual sector works included land improvement (surface drainage) and farm
machinery for about 1500 individual farms, while the subloans to the social
sector subborrowers were to finance (i) land clearing and land levelling and
subsurface drains, (ii) farm machinery, (iii) four farmyards, and (iv) 25 km
of macadam access roads and 10 km of gravel access roads. Actually, in the
individual sector 31,422 ha have been developed for agricultural production
and about 6000 ha of meadows have been reclaimed. In the social sector,
14,579 ha have been developed for agriculture. The total area developed is
46,001 ha, which is 1860 ha more than originally planned (Annex 4, Table 1).
However, loans for activities other than land improvement associated with
drainage fell well short of SAR estimates, the principal reasons being
interest rate fluctuations due to inflation, lack of assistance from ZB and
extensionists in helping identify appropriate investments, and lack of
flexibility to accommodate new investment needs.
4.07        Land levelling and land clearing, which constituted the major
portion of this component, has lessons for future projects. Instead of
burning the stumps and poor quality timber, these were buried at depth below
1.5 m in the social sector and 0.6 m in private land.  After land clearing,
land levelling was done by spreading good earth excavated from canals in 25 cm
layers followed by fine levelling by disc harrows and levellers. This
operation was somewhat costly and time-consuming but disposal in this manner
was preferred by the Borrower and accepted by the Bank. For future projects,
this method needs to be carefully analyzed before it is adopted as it requires
heavy equipment involving higher costs.

5.01        Land Use. In the total project area of 61,233 ha, the total
agricultural area has increased from 44,000 ha to 46,000 ha after the project,
through the elimination of pastures and marshes. The arable land has
increased from 39,984 ha to 46,000 ha, (mostly in the social sector) primarily
due to the conversion of meadows to plough land (Annex 4, Table 1), with the
percentage of arable land to the agricultural area rising from 65X to 75X.
Land consolidation decreased the number of plots per farm from 10 to 2 and
increased the average farm size from 4 ha to about 4.9 ha per farm. The total
cropped area with the project is estimated at about 46,000 ha, of which 14,600
are in social sector and 31,400 ha in private sector, approximately the same
as projected at appraisal. The cropping pattern is also approximately the
same as projected in 1978, with the addition of vegetables, fruits, soya beans
and rapeseed over and above what was expected at appraisal (Annex 4, Table 2).
5.02        Yield   As a result of drainage, it was estimated that 19,700 ha
of land prevliously in low yielding permanent grass would come into arable
rotation and the yields in drained land would rise with the use of fertilizers
and an effective extension service to reach 100t of expected values in 3
years. Yields of wheat (6 tons), maize (12 tons) and rapeseed (3 tons/ha)
have been achieved in some areas in the social and private sectors and the
project expects to achieve higher than planned yielduV In 1986, however, crop
yields were lower than planned due to a prolonged winter.  Annex 4, Table 2
shows expected and actual project yields.
5.03        Froduc00n. Social sector production comprises investors of six
enterprises. Due to increased ploughland area of about 9,780 ha and higher
crop yields, increased production is evident. The social sector applies crop
rotations depending upon weather conditions, with a first alternative that
includes 60X winter crops and 401 spring crops, and a second alternative of
801 winter crops and 201 spring crops. The main crops are wheat, maize, and
rapeseed; and new crops include vegetables, fruits and oats. In 1986
production reached 63,830 tons against a projection of about 87,400 tons in
the appraisal estimate.
5.04        Crop productior. in the individual sector is organized through the
cooperatives existing in communes of Ivanic Grad, Sisak and Dugoselo. Some
farmers contract their production through cooperatives in advance in order to
get seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, repaying the loan at final disposal. A
second group of cooperatives consist of farmers selling the final product
through the cooperative while the materials are bought from the cooperatives
with cash. Wheat and maize have been the main crops developed under the
Vi     In some areas, in 1985 maize hybrid 05407 reached 13.4 tons/ha;
wheat, Lonja variety, 8.7 tons/ha; barley, Antares, 7.4 tonu/ha;
rapeseed, 2.7 tons/ha; soyabean (Uskolisna), 3.6 tons/ha.

project. Incremental crop production in 1986 indicates an increase of about
65,000 tons against the ultimate expected increase of 71,000 tons. This
includes grass, forage and main crops, and an increase of double cropped area
with winter maize silage and cereals. Increased crop production is due to 30X
more ploughland (6,000 ha), from reclamation of meadows and to increased
yields.
5.05        Loans were also given to the individual sector for remodelling of
stables, purchase of dairr cows, and procuring equipment for milk, baby beef
and eggs. The following gives the progress of each subproject:
Egg& Maximum production was reached ir. the year 1984 and 1985
with 10.22 million eggs per year from 45,360 hens. The increment
has been 8 26 million eggs/year over 1982 when it was only 1.95
million. The full target of 16.5 million eggs of the appraisal
projection has not yet been attained.
Stee Iftelngn. Only one new facility has been added to the four
existing, capable of an annual production of 1050 heads.
MR. 97 loans were approved for the cooperants 'Dukat' and 72 for
'Gorjna Posavina". In the project area, the number of cows in
1986 was 10,232 compared to 15,641 in 1980, thereby resulting in a
reduction in the milk supply from 11.3 million liters in 1981 to
9.97 million liters in 1985. The major cause of the reduction in
the supply has been the low price of milk, causing farmers to
convert milk into cheese and butter.
All the above increments are much below the appraisal estimates but may be
expected to improve with time and better price incentives. Considering the
pricing policy of milk, it is unlikely that a production level of 35,000
tons/year will be reached.
Prle
5.06        Economic prices of wheat, maize, barley and cereal/soyteans were
calculated on the basis of the Bank projections adjusted to farm gate level.
The economic price of wheat derived from bordar price is about the same price
paid to farmers; economic prices of maize, barley and cereal/soybeans are
about 201 lower than the corresponding actual prices paid to farmers. Prices
of other crops were derived on the basis of actual prices paid to farmers up
to 1986.
Marketna and Markets
5.07        The project area is located closely to consumption centers in
Zagreb which include agroprocessing industries, exporters and domestic users,
a population of nearly 900,000, and a number of food and meat processlng
industries and a milling industry. The increased production of principal
crops still falls short of processing capacity.



- 13 -
The requirement of wheat of "Zitokombinat" and "PIK
Cazma", which are the principal buyers of wheat, is 87,000
tons/year. The project will ultimately produce about 60,000 tons
as estimated at appraisal, leaving a shortfall of about 17,000
tons.
Ragesee   The oil crushing mill in Zagreb has a requirement of
about 91,000 tons of rapeseed annually. The project production
about 16,000 tons from both sectors.
Bardx. The malt factory in Nova Gradiska requires 18,000 tons
annually, whereas the project is producing 9,000 tons. There is
scope for additional production of this crop.
There are still difficulties in storage and drying and the kombinats have not
provided adequate facilities to handle to the additional production.
Additional facilities were not constructed with the project loan in spite of
the recognized need.
5.08        LIm1ok  About 10.5 million liters annuAlly have been supplied to
Zagreb Dairy which has a very large handling capacity (half million ptr day).
There has been no increase in the supply of milk since 1981 due to
unattractive prices and fewer farmers interested in raising cows. Steer
fattening is provided at five different locations with a total annual
production of 1,050 head. For livestock products, the individual farmers have
long term contracts with BOALS or cooperatives and are ensured of the sale of
their products at the prevailing price.
Producer Rotumn
5.09        The net family income both in social and individual sectors have
increased primarily due to increased agricultural area, cropping intensity,
yields, cash crops, and land consolidation. In the social sector, after 1990
when the project starts yielding full benefits, the net family Income is
projected to rise ultimately to about Din. 65,000-121,000/ha depending upon
the area, based on 1986 prices (wheat - Din. 90/kg, maize - 57/kg, rapeseed
Din. 167/kg).  The individual sector comprises farm families with an average
farm size of 4.9 ha at appraisal.  The annual income for farmers was expected
to reach Din. 7,800/ha. Per capita annual income was anticipated to rise from
Din. 11,800 to about Din. 20,300. Calculations based on 1986 prices show that
actual net income ranged from Din. 17,000/ha in 1981 to Din. 65,800/ha in 1986
from wheat cultivation and from Din. 14,000/ha to Din. 53.500/ha for maize.v

5.10        The financial analysis in the Borrower PCR of six social sector
enterprises shows expected rates of return ranging from 19 to 62Z.
Incremental benefits derived from the project have been already quite
significant, though they fall short of the incremental benefits estimated at
appraisal for full development by more than 50 percent. The main reasons for
the lag in the expected incremental benefit are: (a) delay in benefits
materializing; and (b) the failure of actual production of livestock to
develop as projected at appraisal (para 5.05). Direct economic benefits from
the project come from: (a) increased net value of production and income of
farmers compared to the without project situation; and (b) increased
employment and works on the farm which would create approximately 3000 new
permanent jobs as well as numerous seasonal ones. The project has already
created an increase in employment opportunities for auxiliary services,
related to supporting services. The main indirect benefits include the
development of access roads, which would have both social and economic
benefits around the project area, and the expected improvement in S.ood supply
resulting from increased production. Other indirect benefits have arisen from
an increase in commercial and banking actitivies which have resulted when
production is marketed and more financial resources are demanded.
5.11        The economic rate of return for the project has been estimated at
about 81, compared to 16.6X estimated at appraisal. The reasons for the lower
rate of return are: (a) higher than projected project costs relative to
returns; (b) appraisal yields not fully realized; (c) yield increases slower
in materializing than expected; and (d) livestock benefits not realized. The
rate of return calculations are based on the following assumptions: (a) the
lifetime of the project is assumed to be 40 years; (b) all investments and
benefits are based on constant 1986 prices; and (c) economic prices for wheat,
maize, cereals/soybean and barley, are derived from estimates of border prices
ard Bank projections, adjusted to farm gate level, while prevailing farm gate
prices were used for other non-tradedable products. Sensitivity analysis
Lndicates that a 20X decline in benefit values would reduce the rate of return
to about 6X, while 201 increase in benefits value would cause the rate of
return to rise to about 9.51. (Annex 5, Tables 1 thru 4).
Environmental Impact
5.12        There has been no apparent adverse effect on the environment
experienced thus far with the implementation of this project. Pollution
occuring due to decay of forest wood leaves and, industrial waste has declined
due to reclamation of water logged lands. Organic and inorganic matter
brought in by floods has been eradicated. Pollution from industrial waste is
controlled by treatment plants and the enforcement of the Water Act. Flood
-protection measures have reduced the flood damage in 6,000 ha of Zutica
storage and around Crnec-Zelina-Lonja channel. The forest area in the project
continues to provide habitat to numerous animal species which include deer and
goat. Their movement and future population are expected to be affected due to
increased agriculture areas or overhunting. The small game comprise rabbits,
pheasant, partridge and duck. Overhunting and disease, if not controlled, are
likely to reduce their population. Use of insecticides, aerial spraying and
herbicides also adversely affect the habitat of birds and animals for which



- 15 -
control measures and monitoring are necessary. The important environmental
issue relates to the effects on the oak forest and wetlands located in the
lower part of the basin, being used presently as a flood relief basin. The
landscape, comprlsing old meander channels and oxbows are considered important
centers for wildlife. A Bank mission visited the area in June 1987 to study
the impact of these issues on the environment and a detailed study was
undertaken. As a result, these environmental effects are being considered in
drainage sub-projects under ongoing Bank loans.

VI. INSTlMTM&N PEREORMANCE
Inutimonal DGn *nd Perfoance
6.01        OVP, the water resource management agency for the Sava River
Basin, founded in 1961, is a financially autonomous enterprise under the
Secretariat of Water Economy of SR Croatia. Its main responsibilities are to
perform operation and maintenance work, flood control operations and
construction of flood control and drainage infrastructure. It is managed by a
director and comprises seven BOALs, of which five function in the project
area. OVP has been responsible for the impleaentation and overall
coordination of this project. OVP also supported and coordinated the land
consolidation program in 47,625 ha, formed an agriculture extension service
for about 5200 farmers in the project area and implemented the training
program abroad of selected technical staff in the field of drainage works and
extension services. In accordance with the Project Agreement, a Project Unit
(PU) was constituted in OVP for the execution of this project. It is a part
of the OVP's administrative office headed by a director, and staffed
adequately with experienced personnel. SVIZ Sava and local SVIZ meet the cost
of PU personnel for administering the project.
6.02        In February 1980, the Executive Council of the Parliament SR
Croatia formed the Coordination Committee for che implementation of the
project. It met frequently to sort out the project problems and pursue
sanctions. It had both a supervisory and advisory role. The committee
(consisting of representatives of various bodies of the Executive Council of
Parliament, ZB, and the association of Investors) solved numerous problems
concerning the project. The Committee held 20 sessions discussing important
problems relating to project implementation.
6.03        Regional Drainage User Associations, named SIZs (Self-managed
Water Economy Interest Communities of the Catchment Areas), have a membership
of all farmers in the Catchment area, and have been responsible for making
decisions on drainage investments, operation and maintenance of drainage works
and collection of funds from users. SVIZ-Sava is the association for flood
control investments in Sava River basin, collecting funds for the Social
Sector in the basin. The SIZs and SVIZ-Sava employed contractors/or BOALs, as
they have no staff of their own, to construct project works and carry out
operation and maintenance.
-6.04       ZB was responsible for providing medium and long-term investment
credit to the individual farm sector enterprises and cooperatives either
directly or through social sector enterprises. ZB provided subloans amounting
to Din. 2,855 million of their own funds and Din. 3,098 million of Bank funds
for on-farm credit under Part A of the project. The purpose of these subloans
was tc finance land improvement works (including sub-surface drainage),
livestock development and other on-farm investments. Fifty percent of the
total lending went to land improvement works.



- 17 -
6.05        ZB carried out appraisal of each sub-loan request for on-farm
development work, paying particular attention to the technical, financial and
economic viability, creditworthiness and the financial rate of return (above
12X in constant Dinars).   The terms of repayment of sub-loans for on-farm
development work ranged from 3 to 15 years including 5 years grace period on
repayment of principal. The interest rates charged by the local bank on these
loans ranged from 6 to 44 percent, while the loans from the road compensation
fund were charged 5X. The interest rate policy for local lending against
these loans changed many times during the life of the project, with exchange
rate fluctuations and inflation.
6.06        ZB has approved the following sub-loans to both private and
individual sectors for on-farm development works:
Part A                            No. of Loans                            TOTAL

Private       0         6           4         0          2         12       831
Social       22        22           0        100                   54i    5.121

The volume of on-lending was considerably less than envisaged at the time of
appraisal. The principal problems were identifying financially acceptable
subprojects by the borrower (ZB), high interest rates and low incremental
returns, and delays in implementation and disbutsement. Bank supervision
missions identified a number of reasons for the delays of sub-loans to the
individual sector in particular. They include:
(a)   the lack of awareness on the part of the individual farmers of the
availability of credit funds;
(b)   lack of understanding of the procedures for preparing loan
requests;
(c)   high interest rates;
(d)   shortage of agricultural extension staff to assist the individual
sector in getting these loans; and
(e)   higher maize prices and lower milk prices that made borrowing for
livestock production unattractive to farmers. -
Difficulty in selecting appropriate investments benefiting the individual
farmer was also a factor contributing to the lack of interest in sub-loans.
Initially, the problem of adjusting the credit program to fit into a dynamic
situation of new investment needs created declining demand for credit, but, in
September 1983, the project description in the loan agreement was broadened to



- 18-
accomodate a more diversified range of investments including grain storage and
drying facilities, and agricultural equipment, and the number of loans to
individuals increased slightly.
Extensgo
6.07        Extension activities in the project area included those undertaken
by the Zagreb dairy, Zagreb oil mill, extension station at Seavete and the
extension department of Kombinat Vrbovec, and an extension centre in Zagreb.
Since the existing extension service was found to be weak and inadequately
staffed for taking the project load, additional facilities were provided for
the project by OVP. There has been an increase of 462 employees in the social
sector, of which 47 are graduate, and 37 undergraduates. Despite this
increase, during the project implementation period the extension service did
not provide adequate support to the individual farmers in obtaining on-farm
credit. This was one factor contributing to the failure of this portion of
the credit component. The main objective of this extension service is to
train the farmers in correct crop timing and fertilizer use, improvement of
livestock facilities, improving quality of home grown forage, improving
quality of milk production, and introduction of rapeseed (a new crop). The
Institute of Plant Breeding of the Faculty of Agricultural Science, Zagreb has
an adequate number of highly qualified staff involved in the creation of new
crop varieties and production of high quality seeds, which work together well
with the various extension services.
Cost RecoverY and Malntenance
6.08        Recovery of the capital and recurrent costs was based on 5 ha farm
model at appraisal and it was agreed upon that ZB would effect it through four
types of charges as follows (1979 prices):
(i) Project charges - 200 dinars/ha to be paid in 2 years in
four equal installments.
(ii)   Incremental water tax - 327 dinars/ha by the Social Sector.
(iii)   Incremental land tax - 1900 dinars/ha by the Individual
Sector.
(iv) Drainage charge (annual) - 540 dinar/ha/year by both
Individual and Social Sectors, payable after the grace
period of 3 years.
It was agreed that the social sector would pay a total of 3,658 dinars/ha for
partial recovery of capital costs and O&f while the individual sector would
pay 8,888 dinars/ha. The cost recovery index for both sectors represented
approximately 29X excluding sub-surface drains and 321 including sub-surface
drainage. The balance would be borne by ZB, and by SVIZ-Sava through their
overall basin charges. Cost of sub-surface pipe drains financed through
credit by ZB for both sectors would be fully recovered under the on-farm
credit component. There was no cost recovery covenant in the loan agreement.



- 19 -
6.09        There is virtually no mention of cost recovery during the
implementation of the project. The current system is based on the system that
exlsted ln the Region before the project. According to the Borrower PCR, the
current sources of revenue are: (1) Water Management Tax - which is paid by
citizens or entities owning or using land in the respective catchment area.
It is determined by the value of wheat, each type of land is assessed by a
different kg of wheat per hectare. (2) Water Management Compensation - this
charge is for the use of water from public water supply, water used for
lndustrial purposes, and tax for excavation of sand and gravel, and a
pollution control charge.  Each of the ten SVIZs have different schedules of
recovery under water management in terms of kilos of wheat. The system is not
as -projected in the appraisal report. The balance sheet of five SVIZs shown
in the Borrower PCR indicates that the water charges were sufficient in 1986
to cover maintenance, but in most cases resulted ln a negative cash flow due
to debt servicing. Projections indicate a marginal positive future cash flow.
The SVIZs collect the funds and the BOALs of VRO Zagreb operate and manage the
works. The current system of cost recovery does not seem to be hampering the
continued operation of the system. Sufficient equipment is available with the
BOALs for maintaining the system.  The total staff for maintenance employed in
these four BOALs is 533 (in 1986), an increase of 125 over 1980.
Reorina. Accounina and Auditng
6.10        It was agreed with the Bank that ZB with the support of OVP would
provide quarterly progress reports which would focus on implementation
problems and corrective actions. The first such report was received in the
Bank for the quarter ending June 1980, and the last one up to the quarter
ending June 1986, coinciding with the project completion date. Bank
supervision missions considered that the accounts were adequately maintained
by ZB and OVP according to the agreement with the Bank and yearly audit
reports were submitted to the Bank as required within 6 months of each fiscal
year. It was also agreed with the Bank that ZB would be responsible for the
monitoring and evaluation of the project's credit component and the
establishment of a management information system. The OVP was responsible for
monitoring the project works and sub-surface drains. These activities were
satisfactorily conducted by the respective agencies, reported to the Bank in
their progress reports, and verified by Bank missions.
Perfomance of the ank
6.11        The Bank's Involvement in the project remained active from 1977
with a total of 30 Bank staff visits. During the implementation period (1979
to 1986) there were 12 full supervision missions of the project. Important
matters relating to the design of the drainage system, expediting procurement
matters, compliance with loan covenants, and seeking solutions to various
problems remained the main objective of these visits. The last supervision
mission was in October 1986.

VII.   anMusjaDIifgd_L,ns Lend
7.01        The Croatia Sava drainage project has been satisfactorily
completed. The drainage system is functioning and the impact is evident in
the increase in crop production. The increased crop yields indicate that at
full production, the estimated production increases will be fully achieved and
an ERR of 8X is expected to be realized.
7.02        It is now possible to grow cereal crops for the first time in the
reclaimed areas as high yields have been achieved:  wheat (over 6 tons/ha),
maize (over 12 tons/ha), and rapeseed (3 tons/ha).  Due to price distortions,
milk and meat prodlction appears less attractive to the private sector and
projected production increases may not be achieved. As a result of flood
control and drainage works, the cultivated area has increased substantially by
15,700 ha, from 23,700 ha to 39,400 ha. This success has been due to good
planning, design and implementation. This drainage project is, therefore, a
prototype model for future reclamation projects in the Sava River Basin, whose
large area is flood prone.
7.03        Project implementation, planned for five years, took seven years
to complete. The first two years were required for planning and design, the
preparation of bid documents, and the procurement of machinery. Without
exception, ICB procedures are quoted by the borrower to be the main reason for
delays in completing the project. This point may not be entirely justified.
A more realistic implementation schedule should have been formulated taking
into account the time needed for advance preparation. For the force account
works, more advance preparation time was necessary given the magnitude and
complexity of the project. However, force account was the best choice for
this work. By June 1985, according to a supervision mission, the project had
overcome its initial setbacks. The implementation unit had been strengthened
and had successfully implemented the project. The lessons learned from this
project helped in designing the implementation organization in other loans.!/
The project unit strengthened OVP's administrative capacity and coordinated
with BOAJs and SVIZs involved in the execution of the project, and has
remained a part of the OVP General Manager's Administrative Office.
7.04        Despite initial delays, the project was completed successfully.
The closing date was extended by one year from June 30, 1985 to June 30, 1986,
but the loan account was kept open on an exceptional basis until April 30,
1987 to allow remaining disbursemerts on pending withdrawal applications. The
success of the construction of the drainage system can be attributed to the
flexibility and coordination of all parties concerned including the Bank, the
Government of SR Croatia the investors and the consultants, in modifying the
design concept in line with the project objectives and economic justification.
For example, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Agricultural Development
(Loan 2136-YU), the Semberija Drainage Project (Loan 2161-YU)
and the Serbia Regional Development Project (Loan 2307-YU).



- 21 -
The contribution made by the consultants as a result of their field
experiments and research on sub-surface drainage design in the three pilot
areas with different soils has been very effective in evolving economic
designs for sub-surface drainage systems. As a result of these experiments,
the Bank recommends continuing these trials.
7.05        Project cost in local currency increased from Din. 2,625 million
to Din. 15,347 million, due to high local inflation and devaluation of the
dinar. However, the project cost in US$ decreased (Para. 3.06). This created
difficulties in local financing of sub-loans to the individual and social
sectors and consequent delays in granting these sub-loans.
7.06        The lessons learned from the project can be summarized as follows:
(i)   A more realistic implementation schedule should have been
formulated taking into account the time needed for advance
preparation by the Borrower, and the magnitude and
complexity of the works to be carried out by force account.
(ii)   Although the cost recovery system is functioning, and water
charges are sufficient to cover operation and maintenance,
the Bank provided very little input into the design and
implementation of the system during the project period.
There was no loan covenant covering cost recovery. More time
should be spent by the Bank to assist the Borrower in this
critical aspect of any irrigation/drainage project.
(iii)   Adjustments in the program of on-farm credit were not made
early enough during the project period to tailor the
component to current farmer needs. Also, the ability of ZB
and the extension service to administer this component was
overestimated and led to delays in the implementation of
this component.
(iv)   In estimating project benefits at appraisal, the effect of
price controls on production, in this case the production of
meat and milk, were grossly underestimated. Production of
these commodities has actually decreased over the life of
the project due to lack of farmer incentives. (At
appraisal, meat and milk production constituted one third of
project benefits.) In addition, both crop aw4 livestock
production was expected to reach full development in three
years after completion of the project works, an optimistic
estimate.
