I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The overall goal of the 20 year national C.A.P.E. Program (C.A.P.E.) is that by 2024 the natural
environment of the Cape Floristic Region (C.F.R) and adjacent marine environment will be
effectively conserved, restored wherever appropriate and will deliver significant benefits to the
people in a way that is embraced by local communities, endorsed by government and recognised
internationally. (See Plan 1 below which shows the extent of the CFR) .

There are two program development objectives requiring GEF support:

Program objective 1: Capable institutions cooperate to develop a foundation for mainstreaming
biodiversity in the CFR into economic activities.

Program objective 2: Conservation of the CFR is enhanced through piloting and adapting
models for sustainable, effective management

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project has seven inter-related components that collectively will meet the program's two
development objectives. To ensure that capable institutions co-operate to develop a foundation for
mainstreaming biodiversity into the productive landscape of the CFR, there is a need for enabling
activities including (i) institutional strengthening; (ii) involving people; (iii) establishing foundations for
the biodiversity economy; and (iv) program co-ordination, management and monitoring. Enhancing the
conservation of the CFR will be achieved, on the other hand, through piloting and adapting models for
sustainable, effective management in priority sites, by: (v) unleashing the potential of protected areas;
(vi) identifying and securing biodiversity in priority areas in the fragmented landscape; and (vii)
integrating biodiversity concerns into watershed management.c

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Biodiversity: South Africa is considered a megadiversity country, mainly due to its floristic diversity and
the level of endemism. South Africa's plant diversity is estimated at 23,420 species, representing 9% of
the world total. Three of the world's 25 most threatened biodiversity hotspots are found within the
country's boundaries (Cape Floristic Region, Succulent Karoo and Maputaland-Pondoland).

The Cape Floristic Region (CFR), which covers an area of 90,000 square kilometers, comprises one of
six Floral Kingdoms worldwide, and is uniquely the only floral kingdom to be located entirely within the
geographical confines of a single country. The CFR is exceptionally rich in species diversity; in
particular, the region is a storehouse of plant diversity (some 9,600 species of vascular plants have been
recorded). The flora is characterized by high endemism. The region is accordingly, listed as a centre of
plant diversity and endemism. Many species have highly localized distributions. The floral inventory
remains incomplete, and new species are continually being recorded. Some 127 mammal species, 300
birds, 142 reptiles and 144 amphibians have also been recorded. The region is considered an endemic
bird area. The invertebrate fauna is also very rich. Though less well documented than other taxonomic
groups, it is notable for containing an assemblage of ancient taxa that have largely been extirpated
elsewhere. Many species are highly specialised, having developed highly mutualistic relationships with
plants, and like the flora, tend to have very narrow range distributions.

                                                       3
                                                                                                        ISDS



Terrestrial habitat diversity is very high in the region. The natural environment includes semi-arid
ecosystems, with precipitation of less that 500 mm per annum, remnant temperate moist forests along the
eastern coast, and mountain ecosystems, with an altitude gradient ranging from sea level to 2300 meters
above sea level. Habitat diversity is a product of high topographical variation, and substrate and climatic
variation, and in turn influences alpha diversity. Importantly, these landscapes are characterized by a high
biogeographical turnover, manifest in exceptional gamma diversity. Accordingly, seemingly similar
ecosystems may have markedly different characteristics.

The region's freshwater habitats harbour 19 species of fish, all endemic or near-endemic. Numerous
small estuarine areas provide refugia for unique species and for juvenile fish. The coastal area is
influenced by two oceanic currents, the warm Agulhas Current on the East Coast and the cold Benguela
Current on the West Coast, which have their confluence on the Agulhas Bank off Cape Agulhas, the
southernmost point in Africa. 11,000 species of marine animals have been recorded in South African
waters, of which 3,500 are endemic to the region occurring only between Cape Point and Port Elizabeth.
The marine fish fauna is very rich with some 400 species recorded (including several notable endemics).
The nutrient rich Benguela Current, in particular, is noted for its productive fisheries, although the
Agulhas has greater absolute diversity. The mollusc fauna, and other benthic communities are also
exceptionally rich. These communities are characterized by a high rate of turnover across the seascape.
These ecosystems further harbour an array of rare fauna, including petrels, albatrosses, African Penguins
and other sea birds, important whale populations, fur seals and pelagic sharks.

Threats: The rich biodiversity of the CFR is under serious threat, as a result of the conversion of natural
habitat to permanent agriculture and to rangelands for cattle, sheep and ostriches, inappropriate fire
management, rapid and insensitive infrastructural development, over-exploitation of marine resources
and wild flowers, and infestation by alien species. Some important habitats have been reduced by over
90% and less than 5% of land in the lowlands enjoys any conservation status. The region has therefore
been identified as one of the world's `hottest' biodiversity hotspots. There is an urgent unmet need to
arrest these anthropogenic pressures, through the creation of an enabling institutional co-ordination
framework at the regional and local levels, the creation of a bio-geographically representative system of
protected areas, with different objectives and operated under various management arrangements, and
through mainstreaming conservation into the productive sectors, particularly agriculture, forestry and
fisheries. This will in turn require the creation of durable multi-stakeholder public-private partnerships.

Social and Economic Context: The CFR spans the provinces of the Western Cape and Eastern Cape and
has an estimated population of approximately 5,2 million. Some 20 ­ 30% of the population resides in
rural areas, which harbour the greatest biodiversity, although many urban communities also reside on or
adjacent to biologically significant areas.

The population is dispersed across a wide area and is characterized by diversity in terms of ethnicity,
language and culture. Socio-economic disparities are marked, as are disparities in skills and access to
resources. There are sizable pockets of poverty existing throughout, in both rural and urban areas. On the
whole, the population of the Western Cape enjoys a greater degree of human, economic and social
development than their Eastern Cape counterparts, where unemployment is estimated at 49%. Many
poorer rural communities are dependent upon wild resources, particularly marine resources and
medicinal plants for subsistence purposes and income generation.

A range of land tenure arrangements is in evidence, including large, medium and small free holdings,
state-owned land under different management arrangements, and a small proportion of communal land.
As much of the biological heritage rests on land outside the public land estate, there is a need to develop
tailor-made models encouraging conservation on private and communal lands-accommodating the

different cost-benefit and risk calculus of small, medium and large landholders and the various
communities.

Policy Context: South Africa confronts numerous pressing social and economic problems, most notably
widespread poverty and socio-economic inequities. The country ratified the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD) in 1995 and is moving to address its obligations under the Convention within a larger
framework for sustainable development that addresses the root causes of biodiversity loss, including by
ameliorating poverty, promoting the development of livelihoods compatible with conservation objectives,
and securing the participation of all sectors of society in implementation. This strategy is consistent with
the plan of action agreed by world leaders at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development
(WSSD).

In 2000, the Government approved a Medium-Term GEF Project Priority Framework, identifying
strategic areas for GEF investment needed to catalyse a broad spectrum of environmental management
endeavors of high national priority. In 1997, a White Paper entitled Conservation and Sustainable Use of
South Africa's Biological Diversity was approved as government policy. The White Paper informed the
design of elements of the GEF Framework addressing biodiversity conservation objectives. A key
objective is to expand conservation activities to encompass whole ecological landscapes, focusing on
biomes by seeking to "integrate conservation objectives into the productive sectors, strengthen land use
planning and monitoring functions, develop and support implementation of conservation models,
establish new institutional and operational mechanisms, and establish new conservation partnerships
bridging the public and private sectors" GEF Medium-Term Project Priority Framework 2000. The CFR was
identified as a top priority for GEF intervention, to secure these intended outcomes through a holistic and
long-term programmatic approach.

GEF Support: In 1998, the GEF provided US$ 12.3 million in funding through the World Bank for the
Project: Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation (CPBCP). The project provided funding to strengthen
management of and extend the globally significant Cape Peninsula National Park (CPNP), to
part-capitalize an environmental trust fund, the Table Mountain Fund (TMF), and to prepare the CAPE
2000 Strategy. These respective interventions have all successfully attained their expected outcomes.

The Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation Project in essence constitutes a pre-feasibility phase and
substantial site based investment for a broader initiative to protect the entire CFR. Its success, attributed
in large part to strong government commitment and stakeholder support, provides a strong assurance that
further conservation measures intended to realize the C.A.P.E. vision have a high probability of success,
both in terms of mitigating threats and engineering sustainability. These fundamentals provide the
conditions necessary for further GEF support, as part of a larger package of financing, to secure
biodiversity conservation objectives within the CFR.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The Program is designed to have a substantial positive global environmental benefit which
secures the CFR for future generations. The Project will support conservation actions including planning,
consolidation of protected areas and management planning as follows: Consolidation of 3 mega-reserves (
Baviaanskloof, Garden Route, Cedarberg) and establishing 2 priority freshwater and estuarine protected
areas ( West Coast and Garden Route). Some activities may automatically trigger South Africa's well
functioning environmental impact assessment legislation as well as in some cases Bank safeguards. As the
CAPE 2000 Strategy in essence constituted a major strategic environmental assessment for the whole of the
CFR, this exercise has not been repeated during preparation. Instead it is proposed that an Environment and

Social Management Framework (ESMF) is developed to address all safeguard issues requiring downstream
Program compliance, prior to appraisal. Whilst South Africa's environmental impact assessment legislation
is in the process of being redrafted, discussions with government indicate that the focus is primarily on
improving efficiency in implementation and not a relaxation of the intent of the legislation. Changes in
National legislation will be independently reviewed and provided to the ASPEN Team to verify consistency.
The program does not upfront trigger any environmental assessment requirements.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project is designed to remove threats and root causes to biodiversity losses in the CFR and to have a
positive impact on globally-significant biodiversity and cultural property. It is thus not expected to result
in any significant safeguard issues or negative impacts. An ESMF will however be developed in line with
Bank safeguard requirements for EA, natural habitats, forestry and cultural property. EA is triggered
through planning and provision of minor infrastructure as outlined in Section B above.The project
involves the restoration of natural habitats and the Garden Route activity is located in an important
indigenous forest area. Minor infrastructure in the planned areas could include roads, footpaths, fences
and overnight visitor facilities. For the purpose of addressing land acquisition/incorporation into
protected areas and issues related to potential loss of access to natural and economic resources
which may arise during project implementation, a combined Resettlement Policy Framework and
Process Framework will be prepared. The purpose of the RPF/PF and the ESMF, is to clarify
potential resettlement and compensation principles which may become applicable if land or
marine areas are incorporated into conservation areas (as well as land which is not protected) or
is required for project purposes".

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

                                                                                                              ISDS




II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
The program is expected to result in a long term positive impact on globally significant biodiversity and
the regional economy

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
As the preparation of the project has resulted in an assessment of the best spatial options for GEF support
    the decision framework and reasons for selection will be documented in the ESMF.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
TOR's are being developed for the studies triggered above and guidance is being provided by the Bank in
this regard. The guiding documents which will be produced will include an ESMF and a RPF/PF.
The RPF/PF are guiding documents which describe the principles which will be applicable
should the project require land/marine resource conservation or cause loss of access to natural
and economic resources. The actual resettlement/compensation plans would only be prepared
once the spatial definition of project interventions is determined.

The ESMF and RPF/RP will therefore establish the triggers for when more detailed Bank
safeguard policies need to be complied with, how the recipient will take these decisions, how
these decisions will be reviewed by the Bank and the relevant safeguard reports reviewed,
approved, disclosed and implementation of decisions monitored by the Bank.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Stakeholders will be consulted as per South African environmental impact assessment and land use
planning legislation as legislative requirements are triggered as well as for forward and strategic planning
as happened during the original design of the CAPE 2000. South African legislation requires all interested
and effected parties to be notified when an environmental impact assessment is to be undertaken and to
invite them to participate in the process ie for a detailed site based intervention

Regarding Bank requirements, the ESMF will be disclosed to stakeholders prior to appraissal. The ESMF
will largely be compiled from the detailed information which has already been provided through extensive
involvement of stakeholders during the preparation of the PCD. Site based interventions will involve
detailed consultation with stakeholders as per South African legal requirements. South African legislation
finally makes provision for review of environment related decisions by the Minister of Environment and
ultimately by court where a stakeholder wishes to appeal a decision.

The CAPE process is currently steered by an Implementation and Coordination Committee both of which
will be continued. This will include consultation on an annual basis around the CAPE work program. Key
stakeholders are represented at political and technical level on these structures.

Where Resettlement Action Plans may at later stage be required these will be developed in detail with
affected parties.
The ESMF and RPF/PF will be separately disclosed on the internet and in hard copy and to the Cape
Implementation Committee prior to appraisal as well
as to the Infoshop. Hard copies of the reports will be made available to stakeholders, the World Bank
Country office (PIC) and HQ including the Infoshop. If the development process indicates that other
disclosure mechanisms are required this will also take place.
