RIO 4LICHO H=DROELECTRIC PROJECT
COSTA RICA
.3Ur; K;Y
i.        This report covers an appraisal of a project in Costa Rica con-
sisting of the first stage of the Rio Macho hydroelectric scheme, the
expansion of existing transmission facilities, and the provision of addi-
tional diesel generating plant. A Bank loan of $8.8 million equivalent
has been requested to cover the foreign exchange cost of the project, the
total cost of which is estimated to be the equivalent of $18.5 million.
ii.       The borrower, who will design, construct and operate the project,
would be the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), a wholly-owned
corporation of the Government of Costa Rica.
iii.      The project will provide 30 MW of hydroelectric generating capacity
at Rio Macho, 8 MW of diesel generating capacity at Colima, and 1 TV of diesel
generating capacity at Limon, an isolated plant on the East Coast. Although
the initial capacity of the hydroelectric scheme is only 30 PRW, the size of
tunnels and other essential features will be sufficient for an ultimate
capacity of 90 NW. The output of the Rio Macho and Colima generating plants
will be fed into the ICE Central Transmission Network, which is being
developed to cover the Central Zone of the country. All generating plants
operated by ICE and other utilities in the zone are, or will be, connected
to this network. The utilities will continue to operate their generating
plants when they are connected to the network, but will be subject to
direction by ICE to insure that system generating capacity is utilized
economically.
iv.       The management of ICE is experienced and its technical staff is
capable of designing and constructing the project in an efficient manner
and at a reasonable cost. The project is scheduled for completion in
April 1963. This construction schedule is realistic. The operational
organization of ICE is sound and fully capable of operating the project after
completion.
v.        The financial position of ICE has been unsatisfactory, due to
grossly inadequate rates, since operations commenced in 1953. Financial
results for the years 1958 and 1959 show an improvement. It is expected
the losses accumulated during the years 1953 through 1956 will have been
liquidated in 1960.
vi.       Although revenues now cover operating expenses they are still
insufficient to give an adequate return on investment. After the rate
increases detailed in paragraph 73 of this report are made effective, the
return on investment should be not less than 7.5%, and about 50% of the funds
necessary for ICEts expansion program should become available from internal



- ii -
cash generation. Debt service coverage should increase from 1.0 in 1960
to 2.7 in 1964 and stay at about this level during the period 1964 to 1969.
The debt/equity ratio is expected to increase from 19/81 in 1959 to a
maximum of 37/63 in 1967.
vii.      The increase in power demands in the service area justifies the
project, which offers the most economical means of providing the required
additional generating capacity.
viii.     The project is considered suitable for a Bank loan of $8.8 million
equivalent, for a period of 25 years, including a grace period of three years
on amortization payments.



RIO MACHO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
COSTA RICA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) consisting of the first stage of the
Rlo I4Iacho nydroelectric scheme with an installed capacity of 30 MW, the
expansion of the existing transmission facilities of ICE, and the provision
of 9 MW of diesel generating plant. Although the initial capacity of the
hydroelectric scheme is only 30 I-nW, the size of tunnels and other essential
features will be sufficient for an ultimate capacity of 90 MW. The estimated
cost of the project is equivalent to US$18.5 million.  The Bank has been
requested to make a loan to cover the foreign exchange cost, estimated to be
equivalent to US$8.8 million, including interest during construction.
2.        The borrower would be the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad
(ICE), a wholly-owned corporation of the Government of Costa Rica.
3.        The project has been designed and planned by ICE, which will also
be responsible for its construction. This repcrt is based on information
obtained by a Bank mission which visited Costa Pica in October 1959, and a
report submitted by ICE.
II. THE BORROWER
4.        The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) is a wholly_
owned statutory corporation of the Government of Costa Rica. It was
established in April 1949 to deal with problems related to the electrifi-
cation of the country according to a well planned and coordinated long-term
development program.
5.        Article No. 8 of the law establishing ICE states:
"As an autonomous institution, the Instituto shall exert
its administrative and technical activities with absolute in-
dependence from the Executive Branch of the Government, guiding
itself exclusively by the decisions of the Board of Directors,
who will act according to their best;` Jlpr-'.t-and will observe
the laws, regulations and technical principles, and will be fully
responsible for their actions."
6.        ICE is subject to the provisions of the 'Ley de Administracion
Financiera de la Republica" (General Finance Administration Act) wrhich lays
down the purchasing procedure to be followed by statutory bodies and requires
their accounts to be audited by the Comptroller General. It is also subject
to the provisions of the National Electric Service Law and supervision by
the regulating authority, the "Servicio Nacional de Electricidad", created
by this law. (For details see paragraph 14,)



- 2-
Organization and Management
7.        The Board of Directcrs consists of a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman
and five other members. Appointments to the Board are made by the President
of the Republic, for periods of eight years. To give continluity and to
guard against political interference, only two members can be appointed
once every four years. Of the seven members, there must be at least three
engineers, one lawyer and one economist.  The present chairman is Senor
Elias Quiroz, President of the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica. Members are
eligible for re-election and four members of the present Board, including
the chairman, have been re-elected.
8.        The chief executive officer of the Board is the General Manager,
who is appointed by the Board. All officers of ICE are under the control
of the General Manager, except the auditor who reports directly to the Board,
ICE is well managed and oDerated, the caliber of its staff is high and its
organization, which has been built up over the past ten years, is sound and
adequate to meet present requirements and those of the foreseeable future.
9.        Although the accounts of ICE are audited by the Government
Comptroller General, as required by law, the audit usually takes place some
time after the close of the financial year. The Board of Directors of ICE
find this unsatisfactory and are appointing a firm of chartered accountants
as external auditors, who will also be able to advise on accounting procedure.
10.       ICE has well organized design and construction departments, staffed
by capable engineers, who gained considerable experience during the con-
struction of the 30 MiW La Garita hydroelectric scheme, wlhich was completed
in 1958. This project was designed by ICE. Advice on som.e features was
received from Electricite de France. Practically all construction work was
carried out by ICE using direct labor, local contractors being used only for
minor works, and as a result valuable experience was gained on dam, tunnel
and power plant construction on a project that is similar, in many respects,
to the Rio Macho scheme.
11.       With the experience gained on La Garita, the staff of ICE are
capable of designing and constructing the Rio Macho project in an efficient
manner and at a reasonable cost. The operational organization of ICE is
fully capable of operating the project after completion.
Financial Position
12.       The financial position of ICE, which is more fully described in
Section VIII of this report, has been unsatisfactory due to inadequate rates
since operations commenced in 1953. Since 1956 the situation has improved
because of large increases in bulk sales at better rates. Revenues now
cover operating expenses but are still insufficient to give an adequate
return on investment and do not provide reasonable sums for expansion. The
regulating authority (Servicio) and the Government have now agreed that
ICEts rates shall be adjusted to produce, during each fiscal year beginning



3-
January 1, 1964, a return on the investment of not less than 7.5%. Details
of the rate increases approved to bring the return to this level in 1964
are given in paragraph 72 of this report.
III.  THE EIZCTRIC POW   1. INDUSTRY IN COSTA RICA
13.       The electric power industry in Costa Rica is regulated by the
National Electric Service Law passed in 1941, which created the regulating
body, the "SerTicio Nacional de Electricidad".
14.       This authority has powers to award franchises for the production
and distribution of electric energy, subject to the approval of Congress,
and is responsible for the appraisal and regulation of rates and service
standards. The rate provisions in the National Electric Service Law are not
specific and only state in general terms that electricity rates shall be
computed as nearlyr as possible to the cost of the service, plus a fair com-
pensation for the use of capital. No time limit is set for the regulating
authority, Servicio, to reach a decision on any application for rate adjust-
ments. Any decisicn by Servicio has to be approved by the Government.
l5.       For the purposes of electricity supply Costa Rica may be divided
into two areas:
a)   The Central Zone, which is the most densely populated and
industrialized area. Most of tne water resources of the
country are located in or near this zone and an integrated
transmission system to cover the area is being developed.
(See map attached as an Annex.)
b)   The rest of the country, which is sparsely populated, is
supplied and will continue to be supplied by small isolated
generating plants.
16.       The principal public utilities supplying power in Costa Rica are:
a)   The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)
b)   The Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL)
c)   The Servicio Electrico Nvlunicipal de Alajuela
d)   The Servicio Electrico Municipal de Heredia
e)   The Alfonso P4adriz Company
Of the above only ICE operates outside the Central Zone.
17.       ICE and CNFL are by far the lar.-est of the five utilities.  On
December 31, 1959 they were supplying 89% of the total consumers in Costa
Rica and their combined generating capacity accounted for 93% of the
countryts total,



- 4 -
The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)
18.       ICE, the borrower, operates generating plants whose combined capa-
city accounts for 52% cf the total installed capacityw in Costa Rica, and is
developing a transmission system to cover the Central Zone.
19.       The principal generating facilities of ICE are situated in the
Central Zone and consist of seven hydroelectric plants with a total capacity
of 4.61 MW, one, La Garita, wPrith a capacity of 30 bW, and two diesel plants
with a capacity of 13.69 IW. Outside tne Central Zone four isolated diesel
plants, with a total capacity of 1411 MW, are operated to supply remote
areas.
20.       An integrated transmission system, called the Central Transmission
Network, is being developed by ICE to corer the Central Zone, and all genera-
ting plants operated by ICE and other utilities are, or will be, connected
to this system. The various utilities will continue to operate their gene-
rating plants when they are connected to the network, but will be subject
to direction by ICE to ensure that system generating capacity is utilized
economically. The Rio Macho project when completed will feed into the
network.
21.       ICE sells energy wholesale to utilities in the Central Zone and
retails enerey in districts outside the franchise areas of these utilities
and in other parts of the country where it operates diesel generating plants.
The total number o' consumers supplied by ICE in December 1959 was 19,075,
about 23% of the total consumers in Costa Rica. Of this total, only 4,645
consumers were situated outside the Central Zone.
The Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (C51FL)
22.       CNFL is a subsidiary of the hmerican and Foreign Power Company.
It was established in 1928 and supplies enerey to consumers in the San Jose
metropolitan and neighboring areas. There has been for some time a strong
feeling in certain quarters in Costa Rica that the company should be national-
ized. The Government recognizes that, under the terms of the existing agree-
ment with CNFL, it would have to give compensation if such action is taken.
This would amount to a considerable sum, possibly between $12 and $15 million.
Hence, in other quarters it is considered more advisable to devote public
funds to the expansion of ICE's present facilities.   The CNFL franchise
expires in 1966 but it is probable the company will continue operations on
present terms and conditions after this date.
23.       The public service contract, executed in 1941 with CNFL, is
administered on behalf of the State, by Servicio.  CIFL is not subject,
however, to any provisions of the National Electric Service Law which would
override or contradict the terms and conditions of the franchise contract
which was signed prior to the law being passed by Congress. The rate pro-
visions in the contract provide for an increase in rates if it can be shown



that revenues, during the year under review, are insufficient to meet operating
expenses and provide a 10% return on net investment capital, i.e. total fixed
assets less depreciation and debt. A summary of the rate provisions in the
contract is given in AnrLex 1.
24.       CNFL may not, however, increase the capacity of its generating plants
without first obtaining permission from Servicio, the regulating authority.
As water resources in Costa Rica are now nationalized it is extremely doubt-
ful if any hydroelectric expansion would be approved, as this would require
an act of Congress, but permission to expand thermal capaci-ty might be granted.
At the present time the capacity of generating plants owned and operated by
CNFL amounts to 38.87 IN, about 41% of the total installed capacity in Costa
Rica. As the output from these plants is insufficient to meet demands on the
CINFL system, which supplies about 66% of the total consumers in Costa Rica,
energy is purchased in bulk from ICE to make up any deficiency. As the
operation of CNFL generating plants is subject to direction by ICE, the amount
of energy purchased in bulk varies from time to time and depends on the amount
of water available to both the ICE and CIFL hydroelectric plants.
Other Utilities
25.       The Servicio Electrico Municipal de Alajuela and the Servicio
Municipal de Heredia operate small hydroelectric plants with a combined
capacity of 3.01 MW, and on December 31, 1959 they were supplying 9,658
consumers in the two cities and in the neighboring areas. As the output of
their hydroelectric plants is insufficient to meet demands, bulk supplies
of energy are purchased from ICE to make up deficiencies.
26.       The Alfonso 11Hadriz Company operates two small hydroelectric plants,,
with a combined capacity of 3.92 NW, and sells the total output to ICE.
IV. THE POPJT.R MARKET
Existing Generating Capacity
27.       The present generating capacity in Costa Rica totals 95.21 MW.
Of this total, 94.i NW, about 98%, is in the Central Zone of the country
and feeds into the central transmission network. Details of installed
capacity are.

Outside the Central Zone, ICE operates four isolated diesel plants, with
a total capacityj of 1.11 Ml.
j:ver4l-l Consumption in Costa Rica
28.       The consumption of electrical energy in Costa Rica is the highest
per capita in Central America and one of the highest in Latin America, being
nearly 260 kwh in 1959.
29.       The Central Zone of the comutry, with an area of about 1,500
square miles, out of a total of 19,700 square miles, is the area of greatest
economic activity and highest population density. About 63% of the total
population of just over one million lives in this area, and sales of energy
in 1.959 were 290.8 million kwh out of a total for the whole country of
298.9 million kwh.
30.       About 73% of energy sold in the Central Zone in 1959 was supplied
to residential consumers, sa2es to commercial and industrial consumers only
accounting for about 21%. The average consumption by residential consumers
in the metropolitan area of San Jose, where 80% have electric ranges, was
3,670 kwh, in eight of the large towns 2,000 kwh, and in 23 smaller towns
1,166 kwhr These averages, which are high, compare favorably with U.S.
fi-gures.
31.       The total number of consumers in Costa Rica in December 1959 was
84,160, of which 79,515 were in the Central Zone. A breakdown of consumers
in the zone is given in the following table:

32.       Prior to the first stage of the Central Zone integrated transmission
system being commissioned in 1956, the area was supplied by a number of in-
dependent generating plants, and reliable information on the total kuh genera-
ted and sold per annum is not available.
33.       The market for powier in Costa Rica may be broadly divided into three
categories: (a) residential sales, (b) cornmercial and industrial sales, and
(c) other sales, which include sales to Government, municipalities, institu-
tions and for street lighting. A breakdown of sales in these categories
for the years 1956, 1957, 1958 and 1959 is given in the following summary:

Sales outside the Central Zone amounted to less than 3.0% per annum of the
above totals.
Sales by ICE
34.       ICE commenced operations in 1953 with small independent plants
which were previously privately owned. In every case, plant capacity was
insufficient to meet demands.  In 1956 the 11.88 IW Colima diesel plant and
the first stage of the central transmission network was commissioned by ICE.
Power fed into the nrtwork fron this diesel l-:nt onabled CNFL to meet
increased demands without installing additional generating capacity. In
1954 ICE commlenced the construction of the 30 M4W La Garita hydroelectric
scheme and completed it in 1958.
35.       Sales by ICE during the years 1953 to 1959 have shown a very high
rate of increase, particularly in the wFholesale sales, and are summarized
as follows:

Forecast of Future Sales
36.       The pattern of sales in Costa Rica is not expected to change in
the foreseeable future.  ICE estimates for the Central Zone for the period
1960 through 1969 show an average percentage increase per annum of about
7/%, which would double present sales in 10 years.  Their estimate for other
parts of the coumtry show a slightly higher rate of increase, about 11%.
In the light of past experience these estimates are reasonable.
37n       A table showing the actual and estimated sales in the Central Zone
and the remainder of the country for the years 1956 through 1969 is attached
as Annex 2. This table gives a breakdown of sales into three main categories,
the percentage increase per annum, the percentage of total sales for each
category and over-all percentage increase per annum. The only known large
industrial plant likely to be connected within the period under review
is a cement works with an estimated annual consumption of 11.3 million kwh,
which is due for completion in 1962.
Forecast of Sales by ICE
38.       The actual and estimated sales by ICE for the years 1956 through
1969 are shown in Annex 3. The estimates, which are considered reasonable,
show an average percentage increase per annum of 9.5% in retail sales,
11% in wholesale sales, and 10.7% in total sales, during the period 1960
through 1969. The increase in wholesale sales during the period 1956 through
1959 was very high and was due to the output of the ICE diesel plant at
Colima and the La Garita hydroelectric plant, being utilized to meet in-
creasing demands on the central transmission network, and to supply power
in place of the CNFL 10 MW steam plant which, after the commissioning of
La Garita in April 1958, has been used only during dry seasons when water
available for hydro plants was low, as it is costly to operate. From 1960
onwards the estimated rate of increase of wholesale sales is much lower.
This is because only increases in system demands will have to be met. The
CNFL steam plant will still be operated during the dry season but on a reduced
scale as it will be used as a peaking plant.



- 9-
Forecast of Load Growth
39.       The maximum demand on the central transmission network has
increased from 64.6 1W in 1956 to 86.0 SW in 1959 and is expected to reach
159.6 14W in 1969. The actual increase has been 10.1% per annum and the
increase forecast to 1969 is 6.4% per annum. A table showing the actual and
estimated kwh generated and system demands, based on actual and estimated
sales, for the years 1956 through 1969, is attached as Annex 4. A chart is
attached as Annex 5 which shows graphically the curve of system maximum
demand in relation to installed generating capacity. By reference to the
chart it will be seen that the system maximum demand exceeded installed
generating capacity by about 8 MET in 1957 and is expected to again exceed
installed generating capacity by about 5 :-1 in 1961 and 7 KWi in 1962. As
the system maximum demand occurs in December, then ample water is avail-
able, it was met in 1957 by operating all available hydro and thermal
plants at maximumi overload capacity during peak load periods, which are of
I-elatively short duration. The same operating procedure will be followed
in 1961 and 1962. Increased generating capacity to meet future load growth,
in addition to that being provided in 1962 and 1963, will be required in
1965 and again in 1968. To meet increasing demands outside the Central
Zone, ICE will install additional diesel plant as and when required.
40.       The Rio Macho hydroelectric project is scheduled for completion
in April 1963, but system maximum demand is expected to exceed existing
plant capacity long before this. To avoid a power shortage during the
interim period 8 SW of additional diesel plant is to be installed at Colima
by April 1962. This plant is used chiefly for peaking purposes and is
more suitable than a steam plant for this type of operation. Originally
the Rio Macho project was scheduled for completion in June 1962 and the
Colima expansion by June 1961 but work has been delayed due to shortage
of funds.  As explained in the previous paragraph it should be possible
to meet system demands during 1961 and 1962 by operating plant on overload.
In addition to the facilities included in the project, ICE plans to have
30 MW of additional generating capacity in operation in 1965 and another
30 MW in operation in 1968. Adequate stand-by generating capacity will
not be available until these plants are commissioned.
41.       The installed capacity of generating plant at Limon, an isolated
system on the East Coast, is 1.70 14W. The peak demand, which is of short
duration, now exceeds the installed capacity and is met by operating plant
on overload. The additional 1.0 14l of diesel generating plant included
in the project for this system must be installed without delay if load
shedding is to be avoided in the near future.
V.  SOURCES OF HYDROELECTRIC POWER IN COSTA RICA
42.       The water resources of Costa Rica, which can be developed economi-
cally, are estimated by ICE to have a power potential of some 1,500 M4W. A
mountain range divides the country lengthwise and also forms a central



- 10 -
plateau of some 1500 square miles with altitudes ranging between 460 meters
and 1,400 meters.  Practically all major water resources are located on or
near this plateau, known as the Central Zone. The map of Costa Rica attached
as an annex shows the Central Zone.
43.       The average annual rainfall on the Pacific slopes of the mountain
range is about 70 inches and on the Atlantic slopes about 100 inches. On
the Pacific slopes and in the Central Zone there is a definite dry season,
which commences in December and usually continues through April. On the
Atlantic slopes rainfall is more evenly distributed throughout the year but
the months of January, F'ebruary and March have a lower rainfall.
44.       A number of possible sources of power have been investigated by
ICE on the Rio Grande de Tarcoles and the Reventazon rivers and their tributa-
ries, two of the most important drainage outlets of the Central Zone.  The
Rio Grande is located near the center of the zone and flows towards the
Pacific. The Reventazon, which is located near the eastern end of the zone,
flows to the Atlantic. Ten sites, with an estimated total capacity of 525 JAWr
have been selected by ICE as suitable for development, eight of these with a
total capacity of 445 I1W being on the Reventazon river and its tributaries.
45.       Three sites on the Rio iMacho, a tributary of the Reventazon river,
have been chosen by ICE as projects to form the first stage of the integral
development of this river.  These projects are Rio Macho No.l, Rio Macho
No.2, arid the Tapanti project.
46.       The Rio Macho No.1 project will utilize the section of the river
located between elevration 1,560 meters and 1,100 mnters, with a drainage area
of 28 square miles, The initial capacity of this project will be 30 MW but
provision will be made for an ultimate capacity of 90 MW.
47.       The Rio Macho No.2 project, a subsequent stage of development,
will utilize the upper reaches of the river and a reservoir for seasonal
regulation will be included in this scheme. The capacity of the project
will be 30 MW, but the water after being used will go directly into the
regulating reservoir of Rio Mviacho No.1 project, thus allowing the capacity
of this scheme to be increased to 60 11W.
48.       The Tapanti project, which can be considered an extension of the
Rio Macho No.1 project, will divert water, through some 10 miles of tunnel,
from the Tapanti river into the regulating reservoir of Rio MIacho No.1
project, thus allowing its capacity to be increased by a further 30 MW.
49.       The total capacity of the development will thus be 120 MNW, con-
sisting of 90 11W at the No.1 project power plant and 30 NW at the No.2
power plant. All the water used in these projects will flowi into the
Reventazon river and can be utilized again in downstream schemes. The map
attached as an annex shows the proposed development of the head waters of the
Reventazon river.



VI. TIHE PROJECT
50.       The project selected for immfediate development and for Bank financ-
ing is the Rio Mlacho No.1 scheme with an initial capacity of 30 IS.  This
is essentially a run of the river scheme but in a subsequent stage, Rio MTacho
No.2, seasonal storage will be provided in a reservoir to be constructed at
Belan. ICE plans to operate Rio Kiacho No.1 chiefly as a peak load plant.
A general plan of the project is shown on the map attached as an annex*
51.       The waters of the Rio Macho river will be diverted at a site known
as "El Salto", through a free flow tunnel, 1,502 meters in length, into a
regulating reservoir with a capacity of 470,000 cubic meters. The reservoir
will be formed by two earth dykes, which will close a natural depression.
From this reservoir, water will flow through a pressure tunnel, some 2,247
meters in length, to the power plant. The gross head developed will be 460
meters.
52.       The initial capacity of the scheme will be 30 Mvi but the size of
the tunnels and other essential features will be sufficient for an ultimate
capacity of 90 NW.
53.       The generating plant will consist of two 15 ml sets, but provision
will be made for the expansion of the plant to a total of six 15 NW sets at
a later date. The average annual output of the project is estimated to be
100 million kwh. A tailrace some 760 meters in length will carry the waters
from the power plant to the Reventazon river.
54.       The project includes an outdoor step-up substation adjacent to
the power plant, outdoor step-down substations at Colima, Barranca and
La Garita, and apDroximately 80 kilometers of 138 Kv single circuit trans-
mission line. The hydro scheme is planned for completion in April 1963.
To avoid a power shortage in 1962, the project includes additiona'l diesel
generating plant, consisting of two 4 ;W sets, which are to be installed in
an existing station at Colima, where space is available for the expansion of
the building. Additional generating plant consisting of two 0.5 INW diesel
generating sets is also included for Limon, an isolated system on the East
Coast. This plant is urgently required as the system peak demand already
exceeds installed capacity.
Status of Engineering
55.       The project has been planned and is being designed by ICE, who
will also be responsible for its construction. Practically all design work
has been completed and construction has commenced.   Dr. Miguel A. Quinones,
who was previously the Chief Engineer of the Puerto Rico Water Resources
Authority, has been engaged to advise on design and construction, and advice
is being obtained from experienced consultants on the design of such specialize(
features as the earth dykes for the regulating reservoir and the steel and
concrete lining of the pressure tunnel.



- 12 -
56.       Preliminary construction work cormenced in February 1958.  Access
roads to the intake and reservoir sites have been completed and a construc-
tion camp has been ouilt.  Tunnel excavation comrienced in April 1959, about
75% of tunnel No.3 and 95% of tunnel No.1 has been excavated. The regula-
ting reservoir spillway has been completed and preliminary work on the intake
is well advanced.
Construction Schedule
57.       Notices were published in the international technical press and
in the local press about a year ago advising contractors that bids would
soon be invited for various works and equipment. International bids have
now been received for all major items of plant and equipmernt, but contracts
cannot be signed until a Bank loan has been negotiated as foreign exchange
to meet progress payments is not at present available. Civil engineering
works are being carried out by contractors or by ICE using departmental
labor. The project is scheduled for completion by April 1963.
58.       The scheduled dates for the conunencement and completion of the
main features of the project are as follows:

the principal features are shown in the following table. (A more detailed

Basis of Estimated Costs
60.       The costs of civil engineering works are based on the actual unit
costs for similar work carried out by ICi. on the La Garita project, suitably
adjusted to cover increases in the costs of labor and materials which have
taken place since that project was completed in 1958.
61.       Costs of plant and equipment are based on quotations obtained from
manufacturers, and transmission line and substation costs are based on actual
costs, adjusted to cover price increases, of similar work previously carried
out by ICE.
62.       To cover increases in the cost of labor and materials during the con-
struction period, and to provide a margin for unforeseen constructional diffi-
culties, contingencies have been included at the following rates:
Major civil works, such as tunnel
excavation, intake works and the
power plant structure                   -     Local and Foreign Costs 15%
Other civil works                        -   Local and Foreign Costs 10%
Hydroelectric plant and diesel
electric plant                          -    Local and Foreign Costs 10%
Transmission lines and substations      -    Local and Foreign Costs 10%



63.       The cost estimates are realistic and should be adequate providing
no major unforeseen difficulties occur during construction. The sums included
for contingencies should be sufficient to cover any normal increases in the
cost of labor and materials, and to provide a reasonable margin to cover
increases in civil engineering costs which may arise due to constructional
difficulties.
Unit Construction and Generating Costs
64.       The estimated cost of the project, including interest during con-
struction is 103,9 million colones, or US$18.5 million, which includes provi-
sion for the hydroelectric scheme and various other facilities. The esti-
mated cost of the hydroelectric scheme alone is 72.6 million colones or
US$12.92 million including interest during construction, but included in
this cost is a sum equal to US$0.5 million for construction equipment which
will subsequently be available for use on other projects. The depreciated
value of this equipment after the completion of the Rio Macho scheme is
US$0.25 million and, if this sum is deducted, the estimated cost of the
hydroelectric scheme becomes UtS$12.67 million or 71.14 million colones, or
US$422 per KW installed. This is a reasonable figure, as, although the
initial capacity of the scheme is only 30 MW, many features are designed for
an ultimate capacity of 90 P1W. The cost estimates for the subsequent stages
have not yet been prepared but preliminary figures indicate the cost of the
completed development will be below US$300 per KW installed.
65.       The cost of energy generated by the Rio Macho No.l hydroelectric
scheme, delivered to the central transmission network, is estimated at
13.57 U.S. mills per kwh, or 7.6 centavos. Operating costs of the scheme
are based on the actual costs of the La Garita hydroelectric project, and
orovision for depreciation, interest on capital, administration and other
fixed costs which have been taken into account.
Cost of a Thermal Alternative
66.       A thermal plant of similar capacity (30 MW) operated as a peaking
plant would be required if the Rio Macho scheme is not carried out. Assuming
such a plant would be a steam plant, as the capital and operating costs of a
diesel plant of 30 MW capacity would normally be greater, a reasonable capital
cost for a steam plant consisting of two 15 MW sets, constructed adjacent to
the existing Colima diesel plant would be US$200 per KW installed. The
operating cost of such a station would be high as there are no fossil fuels
in Costa Rica and imported Bunker 'IC" fuel oil costs US$3.69 per barrel,
excluding tax.
67.       The capital and operating costs of a hypothetical steam plant
and the Rio Macho scheme are compared in Annex 8. The comparison gives a
rate of return of about 13% for the additional investment required for the
Rio Macho scheme and justifies the higher capital cost of the hydro project.

VII. FUTURE EXPANSION PRPOGPAM
68.       In addition to the increase in generating capacity and the expan-
sion of transmission and distribution facilities covered by the project,
provision has been made in the ICE financial forecast for the years 1960
through 1969 for the following items:
Estimated Cost
Expressed in Millions of:

a)   30 1V of additional hydroelectric capacity
and associated transmission facilities to be
cr,mmissioned in November 1965                  12.71          71.35
b)   30 NW of additional hydroelectric capacity
and associated transmission facilities to be
commissioned in April 1968                      14.11          79.22
c)   Additional diesel generating capacity and
improvements to existing generating plants       0.97           5.42

Note: The estimated costs do not include interest during construction.
VITI.  F..- 
Rates
69.       ICEts rates for both wholesale and retail supplies are established
in accordance with the provisions of the National Electric Service Law which
states rates shall reflect as closely as possible the cost of the services.
For this purpose the law defines the cost as including depreciation calculated
on a straight line basis, interest paid on all debts, plus a fair return on
net invested capital. The regulating authority for the power industry is the
Servicio Nacional de Electricidad, whose decisions have to be approved by the
Government.
70.       The present wholesale rates of ICE were approved in 1958, and
provide for a return of only 4%. The retail rates of ICE up to July 1960,
were substantially the same as those existing before the acquisition of the
various utilities by ICE in 1952. Revenues provided by the retail rates were
grossly insufficient as they covered only 60% of operating costs. Retail rates
were increased 23% on July 1, 1960, but are still much too low.



- 16 -
71.       The regulating authority, Servicio, and the Government have now
agreed that ICEts rates shall be adjusted to produce, during each fiscal year
beginning January 1, 1964, the initial year of full operation of Rio 1Macho,
a return on the investment of not less than 7.5%.
72.       To bring the return to 7.5% in 1964, the following rate increases
have been approved. Retail rates will be adjusted so that the average
revenue per kwh from retail supplies will be increased by 11% on July 1, 1961
and by a further 11% on July 1, 1962. Wholesale rates will be adjusted during
the wet seasons of 1961-1962 and 1962-1963, when ample water is available for
hydro generation and the fuel surcharge for thermal generation is low, so
that the average revenue per kwh from wholesale supplies will be increased
each month by 1% over the previous month, during the periods, from June 1, 1961
to February 28, 1962, and from June 1, 1962 to April 30, 1963, and by 2% each
month over the previous month, from May 1, 1963, when the Rio Macho No.1
hydroelectric scheme is commissioned, until a return of 7.5% is obtained.
Computations based on present sales estimates indicate the rate increases
obtained by September 1963, which should amount to about 34% in wqholesale rates
and 22% in retail rates, should provide a 7.5% return in 1964. Rates will be
adjusted to maintain this rate of return in each subsequent fiscal year, as
and when necessary.
Present Financial Position
73.       ICE was established in 1949 but commenced operation only in 1953.
Condensed balance sheets and income statements for the years 1953 through 1959
are attached as Annexes 9 and 10.
74.       On December 31, 1959 capitalization amounted to 0135.7 million
($2.2 million), consisting of 026.4 million ($4.7 million) of long-term debt
and 0109.3 million ($19.5 million) of equity, the debt/equity ratio being
19/81. This ratio takes into account the transfer of V30 million from debt
to equity, as a result of the taking over by the Government of an ICE bond
issue of corresponding amount as explained in paragraph 77. Fixed assets in
operation (which are shown at original cost because of the stability of the
currency) amounted to $115.8 million ($20.6 million) after depreciation.
75.       The long-term debt, details of which are given in Annex 11,
included:
$ 2.9 million in 6% bonds maturing in 1967.
.14.0 million representing the amount withdrawn of a 19-year
loan of 26 million colones at 8% interest maturing in
1977, negotiated with the Caja Costarricense de Seguro
Social (CC0S), a government agency.
$ 7.4 million from loans negotiated with local and foreign
banks which include two loans each of 72.8 million
($0.5 million) from the Bank of America and the
Chase IManhattan Bank at 6% and 6.5% interest respectively,
for neriods of 3 years, maturing in 1962.
¢ 2.1 million in suppliers' credit-s.

76.       Equity consists entirely of Government contributions on 1/nich no
dividends are paid. These contributions amounted to f112.5 million
($20.0 million) as of December 31, 1959.
77.       The Government contributions, shown in detail in Annex 12, were
obtained in three different forms: equipment, proceeds of certain taxes and
budget appropriations. The amounts are as follows:
Equivalent
Millions of      Value in
Colones      Millions of $
Equipment                              2.6             0.4
Proceeds from taxes                    8.2             1.5
Government budget appropriations     101.7            18.1
Total            112.5            20.0
During the period 1949-1959 the major part of the Government contributions
came from budget appropriations. These budget appropriations were limited, by
a law passed in 1956, to 10 million each year up to and including 1965. A
revision of the law in 1959 reduced the contributions to 06 million a year
from 1960 onwards, and to compensate for the reduction the Governmaent releasedi
ICE of the obligation to pay interest and amortization, from 1960 onwards, on
ICE's 1953 030 million 4% bond issue maturing 1960-1965, which is now shown as
equity in ICE's books. The new law does not fix any limit to the period
during which the annual contribution of 06 million will be paid and7 moreover,
the contribution no longer depends on budget appropriations but is paid
monthly out of the profit of the "Fabrica Nacional de Licores", a Government
monopoly.
78.       The current position of ICE in 1957 and 1958 was far from satis-
factory, as current assets including inventories were less than current
liabilities. The position improved in 1959 after two loans, each of ¢12.8
million ($0.5 million), for periods of three years, had been negotiated with
U.S. banks and current assets covered current liabilities 2.0 times as of
December 31, 1959.
Past Earnings Record
79.       During the period 1953 through 1957 due to grossly inadequate
rates, revenues from operations were insufficient to zover operating expenses,
and on December 31, 1957 the accumulated loss, after charging interest,
amounted to Afh.1 million ($0.7  million).!!  In 1958, as a consequence of
increasing bulk sales at more realistic rates, net income from operations
showed a surplus of 00.5 million and, after charging interest, net profit
1/ ICE is not required to pay any income or local taxes.



- 18 -
amounted to Z0.01 million. In 1959 net income from operations amounted to
g3.7 million and net profit to 00.9 million. In 1960 it is expected these
figures will have increased to gh.1 million and V3.2 million respectively.
The rate of return (ratio of net income from operations to net fixed assets
in operation) was 0.4% in 1958, 3.2% in 1959, and is exFected to be 3.6% in
1960, which is still too low. It is expected that the loss accumulated to
1957 will have been liquidated in 1960.
Financial Plan
80.       A ten year forecast of Sources and Application of Funds is given
in Annex 13 based on assumptions cited in Annex 14.
81.       Construction and working caDital requirements during the period
1960-1969 are estimated to aggregate '276.0 million ($49.0 million).   A
breakdown of these requirements and of the corresponding estimated sources of
funds is as follows:
Cost of Construction Program - 1960-1969
Millions of   Equivalent in
Colones     Millions of $
The proposed project consisting of
the first stage of the Rio iacho
hydroelectric scheme and transmission
lines and additions to the Colima and

If the above program is carried out as planned, the fixed assets of ICE at
the end of 1969 would be valued at 0333 million (459.3 million), nearly three
times their present value.
82.       The Government equity contribution to ICE is estimated at 0'i 1.0
mil'lion during the period 1960-1969; this sum would include the ¢5 million
representing the second half of the 1959 contribution paid early in 1960 and
the annual contribution of ¢6.0 million for each of the years 1960-1965, in
accordance with the law discussed in paragraph 78.   The forecast shows annual
contributions will no longer be required after 1965 and they have, therefore,
been omitted, although as previously stated, the law does not fix any time
limit on the payment of these contributions to ICE.
83.       The construction of the 'aio Macho project will represent the major
part of the expansion program during the period 1960-1963. The project was
started in 1958 and is scheduled for completion in April 1963. The total
cost of the project is estimated at A103.9 million ($18.5 million) and the
expenditures to be incurred during the period 1960-1963 would amount to
Z82.6 million ($l1.47 mi'lion).  In 1962, a 30 M',J hydro project scheduled
for completion in 1965 wouid be commenced and another similar project scheduled
for completion in 1968 would be commenced in 1965. The estimated costs
of these two projects are 071 million ($12.7 million) and ¢79 million
($14.1 million), respectively, excluding interest during construction.



-20 -
84.       The foreign exchange part of the expenditures for the Rio Macho
project, including interest during construction, would amount to !Z4h9.3 million
($8.8 million) and would be financed by the proposed Bank loan which for the
purpose of the calculation has been assumed at 5-3/4% interest and a term of
25 years including 3 years of grace. Amortization is assumed to begin in
May 1964 and end in November 1985. No definite plans have been made for
financing the future 1960-1969 expansion program other than the proposed
project. It has been assumed that the foreign exchange requirements of the
remainder of this program would represent 50% of the total cost, would amount
to ¢85.0 million ($15.0 million), including interest during construction and
would be provided for by two additional foreign loans. The first one would
be effective in 1962 and the second one in 1965. These loans would have
terms of 25 years including 4 years of grace and an interest rate of 5-3/4%.
85.       Local currency requirements for the above ten year construction
program, including the proposed project would amount to $141.6 million
($25.2 million) and would be covered by internal cash generation, Government
contributions and local borrowings. The funds produced by ICE's operations
during the over-all period 1960-1969 should be sufficient to finance 45% of
the total construction program, including the present project; after 196)4,
ICEIs contribution would cover more than 50% of the requirements. The fore-
casts show an accumulated cash surplus at the end of the period under considera-
tion of 0)46.o million ($8.2 million). In practic9 these sums would be
required to finance a further expansion program which would probably start in
1969.
86.       As regards local currency requirements, however, the period
1960-1963 will be critical, due to the slow development of the generation of
internal cash by ICE. The figures for this period are as follows:
Cost Of Construction Program - 1960-1963
(in millions of Colones)
Rio Macho project                            82.6

- 21 -
ICE would provide only 9% of the total requirements. Local currency expendi-
tures would have to be financed mainly from Government contribution and
borrowing. Total borrowing would come to 66% and the Government contributions
would finance 25% of the program. For the Rio Macho project ICE has borrowed
from the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social g26 million at 7% interest and
for a term of 19 years; the proceeds of the loan not yet drawn down amount to
Z12 million.  An additional short-term loan of about 08.4 million ($1.5
million) will be required to meet local currency requirements in 1961 and
1962 and arrangements are being made by ICE for such a loan through the Banco
Nacional de Costa Rica. The loan is expected to be repaid in 1963 from
internal resources when ICE will be getting benefit of the increases in rates
described in paragraph 72.
Estimated Future Earnings
87.       The forecast of earnings for the 10-year period ending 1969, are
shown in Annex 10.  Net income before interest is expected to increase from
4h.1 million ($0.7 million) in 1960 to 013.3 million ($2.4 million) in 1963,
the year when the Rio Macho project is scheduled for completion. In 1969 net
income is estimated at V25.9 million ($4.6 million).
88.       The return on net fixed assets in operation, excluding work in
progress, would increase from 3.6% in 1960 to 7.7% in 1964, the first full
year of operating Rio Macho. From 1964 onwards, as agreed by the Servicio de
Electricidad and the Government, this return should amount to a minimum of
7.5% each year. On the basis of the proposed construction program and financ-
ing plan, figures show that the return on net fixed assets in operation
would fall below 7.5% in three of the following 5 years although this would
average 7.5% over the six-year period. Some adjustment in rates may be
required to obtain the minimum return of 7.5%. However, the forecast of
revenues is based on conservative assumptions of increase in sales; if sales
increase at a slightly higher rate than has been assumed, these adjustments in
rates may not be necessary.
Debt Service Coverage
89.       When the rate increases are put into effect, it is expected that
the year end debt service coverage, estimated to be slightly above 1.0 in 1960
would improve gradually and would be 2.69 in 1964 and 2.68 in 1968.   These are
satisfactory coverages.
90.       Under the terms of the proposed loan agreement ICE is precluded
from incurring new debt other than for the project, except by agreement with
the Bank, until the project is completed and in commission. Thereafter, ICE
may not incur debt (without the Bank's consent) unless at tne time of the
proposed borrowing its annual revenues adjusted to reflect the rates in effect
at the time, are not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service in any
future year on existing debt plus the proposed new debt.



- 22 -
Debt/Equity Ratio
91.       The year end debt/equity ratio decreased in 1959 from 39/61 to
19/81 as a result of the Government taking over a part of ICE's debt as
explained in paragraph 77. The debt/equity ratio in 1961, assuming the Bank
loan is made, would be 32/68, and would increase to 35/65 in 1964 and 37/63
in 1967. The sizable expansion program proposed will, therefore, place the
debt/equity ratio in approximately the same position as it was in 1959, before
the Government assumed part of ICE's debt.
Security
92,       Since the CCSS loan is secured by a mortgage, ICE has agreed to
give the Bank ar?ropriate security.
IX. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
93.       The project is needed to meet the growing demand for power in the
Central Zone of Costa Rica. The market for power in this area justifies the
installation of the proposed facilities which are expected to be fully
utilized by 1965.
X. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOIPENDATIONS
94.       The project to be executed by the Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (ICE) is technically sound, the estimated cost is reasonable
and construction schedules are realistic.
95.       The project is necessary to meet the expected load growth require-
ments of the Central Transmission Network. There is no alternative method
of meeting these requirements which would compare favorably on an economic
basis.
96.       The management of ICE is experienced and its technical staff is
capable of designing and constructing the project in an efficient manner and
at a reasonable cost. The operationa'l organization of ICE is sound and
fully capable of operating the project after its completion.
97.       The financial Dosition of ICE has been unsatisfactory  due to
grossly inadequate rates, since operations comrnenced in 1953. Nhe
development of the Central Transmission Network by ICE, and increasing bulk
sales at more realistic rates from 1956 onwards resulted in improved financial
results in 1958 and 1959 and it is expected that the loss accumulated during
the years 1953 through 1956 will have been liquidated in 1960.
98.       Although revenues now cover operating expenses they are still
insufficient to give an adequate return on investment. After the rate increases
detailed in paragraph 72 of this report are made effective, the return on
investment should be not less than 7.5%, and about 50% of the funds necessary



- 23 -
for ICETs expansion program should become available from internal cash
generation.
99.       The accounts of ICE are audited by the Government Comptroller
General, as required by law, but the audit usually takes place some time after
the close of the financial year. The management of ICE agree the present
position is unsatisfactory and are appointing a firm of chartered accountants
as external auditors.
100.      During negotiations the Bank has obtained satisfactory assurance
that:
a) The rate increases detailed in paragraph 72 of this report will
be implemented.
b) ICE and the Government will agree to a rate covenant which will
insure adequate earnings in the future.
c) A firm of chartered accountants will be appointed as external
auditors.
d) ICE will agree to give the Bank appropriate security.
e) ICE will agree to a debt limitation covenant linking debt
service to revenues.
101.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of $8.8 million equivalent,
for a period of 25 years, including a grace period of three years on
amortization payments. The borrower would be the Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad.



AN1hEX 1
Summary of the Rate Provisions in the CIFi' Franchise Corntract
1.        The contract between the Governrment of Costa Rica and C1JFL,
which was signed in 1941, defines the franchise area and the terms and
conditions governing the conpanyts operations.   The contract expires in
1966, but it is probable CNsFL will continue operations on present terms
and conditions after this date.
2.        According to this contract the rates charged by C1FL should be
sufficient to cover the cost of providing the service, including operating
and maintenance exDenses, which are specified, the cost of energy purchased
from other utilities, taxes (excluding income tax), depreciatiorn, and a
fair compensation for the use of capitel.
3.        The annrual charge allowabte for depreciation is determined by
applying a depreciation rate wrhich varies from 2.5,% to 2.0% of the average
gross value of the fixed capital during the year, according to the ratio
of the denreciation reserve to gross fixed capital. When the ratio is
15% or less, the 2.5% rate is applied, and vhen the ratio is 30% or more
then tlhe 2.0,% is applied, with variations of 0.1% in the rate for each
3% change in the ratio between these limits.
4.        The comipensation for the use of capital covers the payment of
interest on all debts at the existing rates, plus a return of 10%s on the
average net capital investment during the year. This average net capital
is determined by deducting from the gross capital invest,-;ent the amount
in the depreciation reserve and the total debt, and adding a sum equal
to 3.5% of gross fixed capital to cover working capoital. This figure is
further adjusted by adding or subtracting any accumulated deficit or
surplus of yearly revenues.
5.        Whenever the gross income during any calendar year is higher or
lower by 55 than the amount necessary to mieet all the above costs for
that year, CN4FL or Servicio may, within the next 6 months follow-ing, re-
quire rates to be adjusted so that the gross income for the following year
is equal to the estirated costs.
6.        Wiithin 60 days from the date either party has given notice of
its desire to revise rates, CNFL shall submit to Servicio, the regulating
authority, the rate modifications it requiires, together with all the
information necessary to show that such a revision is justified. Should
CLiFL fail to submit an application within the said period, then Servicio
shall propose modifications within the following 30 days.
7.        Once CPJFL has submitted such an application, Servicio shall within
the next 60 working days, study the data presented and decide whether an
adjustment of rates is proper. If Servicic decide in the affirmative, it
shall approve the changes proposed by C&FL, or with modifications which it
considered proper in order to adjust the.m to conform to the provisions of



AiYu: 1, p. 2
the contract. Should Servicio fail to act within 60 working days, the
modifications in rates proposed by COTL shall be considered approved.
8.        If the decision of Servicio is not acceptable to CNFL, it shall
appeal to the Cassation Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice which,
acting as a tribunal of equity, shall definitely decide the points in dis-
pute, in accordance with the provisions of the contract.

Detailed Description of the Project
1.        The Rio Macho No. 1 hydro-electric scheme will be situated in
the Central Zone, about 20 miles southeast of San Jose, the capital city.
The works will be between elevations 1,100 meters and 1,560 meters above
sea level.
2.        The scheme is well located in respect of transport facilities as
the power plant will be adjacent to a paved road which forms part of the
country's highway system. Loads of up to 50 tons can be moved by rail from
either the Pacific coast seaport of Puntarenas or the Atlantic coast port
of Limon to Paraiso, about 5 miles from the power plant, where they can be
off-loaded and moved to site by trailer. To enable various works in con-
nection with the scheme to be reached, about 8 miles of access road has
been constructed.
3.        A report on the geology of the Rio Macho area has been prepared
by ICE, who received advice on a number of aspects from Dr. Berlen C.
Moneymaker, Chief Geologist of the Tennessee Valley Authority.   In general,
it can be said the intake works and all tunnels are expected to be in fine
grained quartzose sandstone or silica bearing limestone, and no unusual or
difficult construction problems are anticipated.
4.        The topography of the country in the region of the Rio M4acho river
is very precipitious and the only possible site where any appreciable storage
can be obtained is at Belen, where a reservoir is proposed as part of the
subsequent Rio Iviacho No. 2 scheme. A small regulating reservoir is to be
provided as part of the Rio IM1acho No. 1 scheme, but its capacity will be
very limited and the scheme will be essentially a "run of the river" scheme
until the No. 2 scheme is developed.
The Rio MIacho Catchment Area
5.        The Rio MIacho catchment area is located on the high slopes of the
Talamanca mountains, in the Atlantic water shed. It commences at the
Continental Divide, 2,500 meters above sea level and ends at the junction
of the Rio Macho and Reventazon rivers at 1,100 meters above sea level.
About 90% of the area is under forest, the remainder being natural pasture.
At elevations above 2,000 meters, the mean annual termerature is about
50°F and at 1,100 meters about 70°F.  The catchment area of the Rio Macho
No. 1 scheme, which will utilize the section of the river between eleva-
tions 1,560 meters and 1,100 meters, is 28 square miles. An analysis of
rainfall data obtained from 13 stations located in the Rio Macho and
Reventazon river water sheds shows the Rio Macho water shed has an average
annual rainfall of 208 inches and the Reventazon 102 inches.
Hydrology
6.        Information on rairfall and ran-off has been obtained by ICE
from a number of stream gauging and rainfall recording stations in the are
Continuous flow records of the Rio Macho river for the period 1952 througl



ANINEX 6, p. 2
1958 show the most critical 12-month period occuirred between July 1953
and June 1954, when a miniMum flow of 1.2 cubic meters per second was
recorded. A comparison made by ICE of flows in the Rio Aacho with flows
in the Reventazon river and studies of rainfall records show the Rio T4acho
flows during the critical period afford. a reasonable basis on which to com-
pute the average annual energy oultput and the installed capacity of the Rio
iNacho No. 1 scheme.
Installed Capacity and Energy Output
7.        The capacity to be installed in the Rio Macho No. 1 power plant
has been determined by taking into consideration the amount of water avail-
able, the additional generating capacity required for the integrated trans-
mission system, and how the scheme is to be operated.  The scheme will be
operated as a "peak.ing plant" with its output varying in a.ccordance with
water availability from the Rio lNIacho and from rivers supplying other hydro-
electric plants feeding into the transmission system. Since the scheme will
be a "run of the river" scheine a regulating reservoir to increase availability
during dry seasons is desirable, and a suitable site has been located for a
reservoir of 470,000 cubic meters capacitwy- which will provide weekly regula-
tion. After studying the various factors involved, ICE hlas decided. on an
initial capacity of 30 I'W, consisting of two 15 iM sets, and this is con-
sidered a satisfactory and acceptable arrangement.
8.        Operating as a peaking plant, it is estimated by 1964 the total
capacity of the schemie, 30 iAW, will be required during peak load periods.
This represents a flow of 8.3 cubic meters per second but during wet seasons
(9 months of the year) when ample water is available, it is estimated system
demands will only require a daily output of 320,0CC kwh, which is equal to
a daily average flow of 3.7 cubic meters per second and a daily load factor
of 45.5%, and water will be spilled.  On the basis of flow duration curves
for the critical period July 1953 through June 1954, it is estimated lack
of water during dry seasons will cause tne output to drop to a minimum of
129,000 kwhi per day and the annual output of the scheme is estimated, at
100 million kwh, which is equal to a load factor of 383.  A larger output
during dry seasons will be obtained after the construction of the Rio ,Nacho
No. 2 scheme which will provide a seasonal regulating reservoir.
v? -PDescription of Civil Works
9.        Although the initial output of the scheme will be 30 NW, the main
features are being designed to allow for expansion, through subsequent
stages, to an ultinate capacity of 90 i;W at the power plant.
Intake Works
10.       Originally the waters of the Rio IIacho were to be diverted at a
site known as "El Salto" by means of a svaall arch overflowT dam but borings
indicated sound rock to be at a considerably lower level than first assumed.
This factor, plus some concern about the disposal of boulders transported
along the stream bed led ICE to consider the use of a bottom type intake.
This type of intake is particularly suitable for fast flowiing mountain



ANMEYX 6, p. 3
streams such as the Rio Macho which have clear water with very little sus-
pended matter and with sediment mostly consisting of large boulders.
11.       The design adopted consists of an open canal across the bottom
of the stream protected by a slightly inclined grid. Only the stream flow
and any small sediment will be diverted into the cainal; any large boulders
will roll over the grid. The canal will lead into a tunnel with a sand
trap and sluices to remove small sediment; the clear water will skim over
a weir into the main tunnel.
Tunnel No. 1
12.       This tunnel will be 1,502 meters in length and 2.5 meters in dia-
meter. It will be concrete lined and horseshoe shaped in section. The
tunnel will be practically horizontal and will permit a flow of' 18 cubic
meters per second at a velocity of 3.5 meters per second. The maximum flow
required for an output of 30 PM will be 8.3 cubic meters Der second but
the flow will be increased to about 18 cubic meters per second when subse-
quent stages of the scheme are developed.
Regulating Reservoir
13.       A regulating reservoir at El Llano will be formed by two earth
dykes, one 120 meters long with a maximum height of 11 meters and the other
250 meters lon- and 20 meters high.  The two dykes will close a natural
depression and fcrm a reservoir with a capacity of 470,000 cubic meters.
14.       During most of the wet season sufficient water will be available
to enable the plant to be operated in accordance -with. system requirements
with little or no regulating storage. When the flow drops to 3.2 cubic
meters per second, the daily average flow required to produce 277, 500 kwh,
the minimum storage required to produce this output, and 30 1P during the
peak load period, will be 115,000 cubic meters.
15.       In dry seasons the plant will be operated as a peak load plant
during six days of the week only, as on Sundays the system peak drops con-
siderably.  To produce a minimum of 129,00C kwh each of the six days and
30 bW during the peak period a storage of 154,000 cubic meters will be
required for weekly regulation. The capacity of the reservoir will be more
than suf-ficient to meet these requirements.
Pressure Tunnel
16.       The pressure tunnel will consist of two sections, tunnels Nos. 2
and 3, which will be designed for a flow of 25 cubic meters per second,
sufficient for an ultimate capacity of 90 111. Tunnel No. 2 will be practi-
cally horizontal, except for a short length at the upstream end, and will
be 757 meters in length, circular in section, 3.35 meters in diameter and
concrete lined throughout.  The velocity in this tunnel with a flow of
25 cubic meters per second will be 2.84 meters per second.



ANNEX 6, p. 4
17.       Tunnel No. 3 will be 1,i490 meters long, circular in section,
2.70 meters in diameter and concrete and steel lined to meet hydraulic
pressure conditions. The upstream section 1,090 meters in length, will
be inclined at an angle of 220 30', and the downstream section, 400 meters
long, will be practically horizontal. The velocity in this tunnel with a
flow of 25 cuLbic meters per second will be 4.36 meters per second.
Surge Tank
18.       A restricted orifice type surge tank will be installed at the down-
stream end of tunnel No. 2.   The tank will be of steel, cylindrical in shape,
and will be designed for total load rejection on the basis of an ultimate
capacity of 90 11W.
Power Plant
19.       The power plant will be housed in a steel framed building with
brick walls.  Initially only two 15 NW sets will be installed, but pro-
vision -will be made for the exnansion of the building and other works to
cover an ultimate total of six 15 NN sets.
20.       The turbines will be of the double nozzle Pelton type, each with
a rated capacity of 24,500 BHP which will provide for a 155>; continuous
overload capacity on the rated out-ut of the alternators.   Each turbine
will be directl- coupled to a 3 phase, 60 cycle, 13.3 Kv alternator with
a rated output of 18.75 TVA at 0.8 psoer factor and an overload capacity
of 15%.
Tailrace Channel
21.       The design of the discharge tuiinel in the power hlouse is being
checked b- means of a hydraulic model and advice will also be obtaiined
from the rinanufacturers of turbines which are to be installed.  In order
to provide an ample margin against the possibility of load rejection by
one or more sets affecting the operation of the remaining sets, the ori-
ginal design of the tailrace has been increased by 15%Q.  Suitable energy
absorbers will be specified as part of the turbine equipment to dissipate
the energy of deflected jets during load rejection. The tailrace channel
wili be 760 meters in length, 4 meters square in section, and will carry
the waters from thae power plant to the R.eventazon river.
Transmission Lines and Substations
22.       An outdoor type duplicate bus bar step-up substation will be con-
structed adjacent to the power plant.   The substation will have two 21.5 HvrvA
13.8/138 Kv transformers controlled by 138 Kv circuit breakers with a
rupturing capacity of 2,500 d VA. There will be one outgoing 138 Kv circuit
to Colima initially but provision will be made for a second circuit.



AN NEX 6, p. 5
23.       A 138 Kv trarismission line 38 Km in length will connectthe scheme
to the integrated system at Colima substation.  Steel towers suitable for
two 60 MVA 3 phase circuits will be provided but only one circuit will be
installed initially. The capacity of Colima substation will be increased
by the installation of a 30 MVA 138/34.5 Kv step-down transformer and switch-
gear to control the incoming 138 Kv line from Rio Macho and additional out-
going 34.5 kv lines, will be installed.
24.       A single circuit 138 Kv transmission line 42 Km in length will be
erected from La Garita hydro-electric scheme where additional switchgear
will be installed to a new substation at Barranca. This substation will
step down the incoming supply from 138 ikv to 34.5 Kv and 13.8 Kv and will
connect the Pacific system Twhich is at present isolated to the integrated
transmission system.
Expansion of Colima Diesel Generating Plant
25.       This plant, which is used chiefly for peaking purposes, consists
of four 3 1NWJ Norburg 2 stroke diesel alternator sets which 2re operated on
Bunker "C" fuel oil. The total capacity of the sets is derated for alti-
tudes from 12.0 N to 11.88 1NW.  The output of the sets is fed into the
integrated transmission system through an adjacent substation. Apple space
is available for the expansion of the station and two 4 NW sets are to be
installed and commissioned by April 1962.
Expansion of Limon Diesel Generating Plant
26.       The generating plant at Limon, a seaport on the East Coast, con-
sists of a small hydro-electric plant with a capacity of 0.7 HW, and two
0.5 FIJ diesel alternator sets. As the system demand already exceeds the
installed generating capacity additional plant is urgently required. The
station building is to be extended and two 0.5 1NW diesel alternator sets
installed.
