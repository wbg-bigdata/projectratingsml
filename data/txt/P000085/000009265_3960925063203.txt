PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
1.        This report presents a completion evaluation of the Fourth Highway
Project and the Third Feeder Roads Project in Benin for which Credit 1142-BEN
in the amount of US$11.1 M was approved on May 14, 1981, and Credit 1485-BEN and
SF23-BEN in the amount of US$12.0 M was approved on May 29, 1984, respectively.
Approximately US$0.21 M was cancelled from Credit 1142-BEN on May 11, 1988, while
approximately US$10,000 and US$3,000 was cancelled from Credits 1485-BEN and
SF23-BEN, respectively.
2.        The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department, Africa Regional Office. It is based
on a review of correspondence files, on the findings of a short mission to Benin
in October 1988, a completion report submitted by the Government on the Fourth
Highway Project, and on discussions with Bank staff assigned to the project.
3.        The completion'report for the Fourth Highway Project noted some useful
lessons on the problems in implementing the project. These include: (a) there
is no doubt that small local contractors can make a useful contribution, but they
were handicapped by inadequate capital and slow payments for work performed;
(b) the next project should provide for longer technical assistance, especially
for the accounting service; and (c) more training of the field maintenance
brigades should have been provided.
4.        This PCR was read bv the Overations Evaluation Department (OE.D).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and Cofinanciers for comments and
they are attached to the Report as an Annex.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT, CREDIT 1142-BEN
THIRD FEEDER ROADS PROJECT, CREDITS 1485-BEN AND SF23-BEN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
A. Obiectives
1.        The objectives of the Fourth Highway Project were to continue the
strengthening of the DRB and the improvements in the efficiency of routine and
periodic road maintenan?e begun under previous highway projects.  To achieve
these objectives, the project was to;
(a)  improve the organization and administrative procedures of DRB;
(b)  train field, workshop and office staff at different levels to carry
out road maintenance tasks;
(c)  continue the program for rehabilitation of paved and laterite roads;
and
(d)  institute axle-load control and road safety programs.
The main objectives of the Third Feeder Roads Project were to: (a) support rural
development by the construction and maintenance of feeder roads; (b) improve
local capacity to plan, coordinate and execute such works; and (c) test the
effectiveness of complementing feeder roads construction with upgrading some
adjoining footpaths to low standard tracks.
B. Implementation Experience
2.        Performance on works by contract for the Fourth Highway Project was
poor, but it was good on the works by departmental fcrcea on both the Highway
and Feeder Roads Projects. Performance on institutional building on the Fourth
Highway Project, and the extension of this work under the Feeder Roads Project
was poor. However, performance on the remaining institutional components of the
Feeder Roads Project was good (paras 5.02-5.06).
3.        Performance of the consultants on the Fourth Highway Project was
unsatisfactory, but the consultants on the Third Feeder Roads Project performed
well (paras 6.01-6.04).
C. Results
4.        The reevaluated rates of return for the rehabilitation of the paved
and laterite road components of the Fourth Highway Project are acceptable. A
reevaluation of the Third Feeder Roads Project is not possible at this time
because the data used at appraisal are not available (paras 4.02-4.04).



- vii -
5.        Both projects demonstrated the importance of having well coordinated
and motivated teams of local staff and competent technical assistance to
implement them (para 8.01).
6.        Labor intensive methods contributed greatly to the success of the
Feeder Roads Project.   They were generally successful in Benin, although as
elsewhere, their effectiveness is limited (a) to areas where labor is readily
available; (b) to roads where a high degree of compacting is not required; and
(c) to road building which does not require the hauling of large quantities of
earthworks over long distances (para 8.04).
D. Sustainability
7.        With the help or follow-up lending operations, the project benefits
are likely to be sustained.
E. Findings and Lessons
8.        The Fourth Highway Project demonstrated over again, the problem of
r1lowing state enterprises to bid on Bank work (para 8.07).
9.        Performance of the Association was mixed.  Some of the contracting
aspects of the Fourth Highway Project should have been supervised more closely.
On the other hand, the monitoring of the Third Feeder Roads Project was
satisfactory (paras 7.01-7.04).
10.       Lessons learned include the followings  (a) even ongoing works from
an earlier project that are being financed under a new project should be
carefully reviewed to ensure that the design is satisfactory, costs ar lip-to-
date, and the works are justified; (b) works being executed by cont^gct, or for
that matter, departmental forces, should be adequately supervised by on-site
staff; and (c) state enterprises should not be allowed to bid on Bank-financed
civil works (para 8.09).

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT. CREDIT 1142-BEN
THIRD FEEDER ROADS PROJECT, CREDITS 1485-BEN AND SF23-BEN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project completion reports for these two projects are presented
together because they complemented each other, and because they were implemented
at about the same time by the same executing agency, the Directorate of Roads
and Bridges (DRB).
1.02      The audit of the First Highway Project noted that the planned training
program in highway maintenance and technical assistance for transport coordina-
tion components were not completed, and the Government was unable to provide
sufficient local funds for road maintenance.  The audit of the Second Highway
Project reported that the institution building objective for road maintenance
(continued from the previous project) wac largely unfulfilled, and that the
transport coordination was deferred to the subsequent project upon the
Government's request. On the other hand. under the Third Highway Project, the
tecinical assistance component was considered generally effective. As regards
the First and Second Feeder Roads Project, the combined PCR noted that while
performance was poor under the First Feeder Roads Project, the Second Feeder
Roads Project achieved 95Z of physical targets, and that institutional
development was satisfactory.
1.03      At the time of appraisal, the DRB included three main divisions:  the
Division of Road Maintenance (SER), the Division of Feeder Roads (SRDR) and the
Division of Equipment Maintenance (SEMTP). The responsibility for carrying out
the Fourth Highway Project was entrusted to the SER.  The responsibility for
implementing the Third Feeder Roads Project was entrusted to the SRDR whtch had
been created several years earlier, and organized as a semi-autonomous entity
with its own administrative and financial services. Both the SER and the SRDR
were supported by the SEMTP.
1.04      This report is based on a review of the correspondence files, including
supervision reports, on the findings of a short mission to Benin in October 1988,
a completion report submitted by the Government on the Fourth Highway Project,
and on discussions with Bank staff assigned to the Project.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. The Fourth Highway Proiect
2.01      In 1975, shortly after execution of the Third Highway Project had
started, the Bank discussed with the Government of Benin (GOB) the possible
scope of a follow-on project which would address both feeder roads and the
maintenance and rehabilitation needs of the main gravel roads.   Feasibility
studies were conducted by the consultants in charge of the First Feeder Roads
Project and of the Third Highway Project.  In early 1980, an initial project
brief was prepared. The two main project components were later divided into two
separate projects.



- 2 -
2.02      The Fourth Highway Project was appraised in mid-1980.  It included
the rehabilitation of about 500 km of main gravel roads and technical assistance
for training personnel and implemeating the project. The main project issue was
the financing of a cost overrun of the paved roads rehabilitation works carried
out under the Third Highway Project. This overrun was caused by the weakening
jf the US dollar which represented a loss in credit value of about US$2 M in CFAF
and, also, by an unusual rainy season in 1978 which caused the break up of about
28 km of paved roads.   This road had to be fully reconstructed instead of
resurfaced as originally scheduled.   The Association agreed to finance the
overrun under the project at an estimated amount of US$6.6 H, and in the absence
of cofinancing, to increase the IDA allocation from US$11 M to US$16.5 M to cover
the entire project cost evaluated at US$20.3 M.
2.03      Negotiations were held in March 1981, at which time confirmation was
received from the OPEC Fund that it would cofinance an amount of US$G.0 M. The
proposed IDA credit was consequently reduced to US$11.3 M. Part of the credit
was to be used for retroactive financing of the paved roads rehabilitation works
already underway, and for the extension of an office building for DRB, the
construction of which was also underway.   The GOB had committed itself to
prefinance these works through the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA).
Proiect Obiectives and Description
2.04      The objectives of the project were to continue the strengthening of
the DRB and the improvements in the efficiency of routine and periodic road
maintenance begun under previous highway projects. To achieve these objectives,
the project was to:
(a) improve the organization and administrative procedures of DRB;
(b)  train field, workshop and office staff at different levels to carry
out road maintenance tasks;
(c) continue the program for rehabilitation of paved and laterite roads;
and
(d) institute axle-load control and road safety programs.
2.05      The project financed the following items:
(a) construction of office space for the new Administrative Division of
DRB;
(b) the rehabilitation, expansion and re-equipping of two existing workshop
buildings and some equipment for the Cotonou workshop;
(c)  a training program for field, office and workshop staff of DRB;
(d) equipment, fuel, and supplies for two brigades to rehabilitate 500 km
of laterite roads;
(e) pavement rehabilitation totalling 35 km and resurfacing of 49 km, by
contract, of sections of the Cotonou-Hilacondji and Come-Lokossa roads;
(f) a research program on pavement construction materials;



- 3 -
(g)  constructing and equipping vehicle weighing stations at Godomey and
Seme;
(h)  a line-marking machine and road signs;
(i)  constructing and equipping a vehicle inspection center in Cotonou;
and
(j)  technical assistance for the above components:  (i) aid in establish-
ing the Administrative Division in DRB; (ii) training for field,
workshop and office staff of DRB; (iii) assistance in the rehabilita-
tion of 500 km of laterite roads and 84 km of paved roads; and
(iv) starting up the new vehicle inspection center in Cotonou.
The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1984.
B. The Third Feeder Roads Proiect
2.06      This project was prepared in 1982 by the SRDR with financing from the
Second Feeder Roads Project. The selection of the roads to be incorporated in
the project had been proposed by the Rural Roads Development and Maintenance
Coordinating Committee (CNAERDR) created under the First Feeder Roads Project.
It was intended that the project would be a continuation of the two previous
projects, and, also, that it would serve as a support of a Rural Development
Project underway in the central provinces of Zou and Borgou.
2.07      The First and the Second Feeder Roads Projects had tested three
different road construction methods comprising equipment intensive, moderately
equipped and labor intensive brigades.  The resulting experience showed that
the heavily mechanized brigades had management difficulties and severe problems
with operational availability of equipment, and that in some regions, the labor
intensive brigades were adversely affected by a scarcity of manpower. Therefore,
a mix of construction technologies was adopted to ensure a better balance between
the need to reduce excessive dependency on labor on the one hand, and to reduce
the dependence on a few items of heavy mechanized equipment and concomitant
supplies on the other. It was also decided to include in the project a pilot
scheme of building low standard t.acks to link small remote communities to the
feeder roads network.  The condition for such construction would be that the
beneficiary communities would be willing to assure labor for their maintenance,
the cost of which would be supported by the local budget.
2.08      The project was  appraised in May 1983.   A technical assistance
component was incorporated in the project to strengthen DRB and SEMTP. The IDA
lending program allowed for a credit of US$11 M for the project, the total cost
of which was estimated at US$13.2 H. Taking into account the difficult financial
situation of the GOB, it was evident that cofinancing was needed, but it could
not be obtained. Finally, it was agreed that IDA would provide a US$6 H credit
and another US$6 H from the IDA Special Fund. This reduced the GOB contribution
to less than lOZ of the total project cost.
2.09      Negotiations were held in April 1984.  The GOB agreed to an action
plan to assure financing and execution of the feeder roads maintenance program.
It also agreed to implement a socio-economic impact study to develop more
specific criteria for selecting low standard tracks to be included in a possible
follow-on project.



Proiect Obiectives and Description
2.10      The main objectives of the project were tot   (a) support rural
development by the construction and maintenance of feeder roads; (b) improve
local capacity to plan, coordinate and execute such works; and (c) test the
effectiveness of complementing feeder roads construction with upgrading some
adjoining footpaths to low standard tracks.
2.11      The project included the following;
(a)  construction/improvement ofs  (i) 840 km of feeder roads; and (ii) on
a pilot basis, low standard low cost tracks connecting selected remote
villages to these feeder roads;
(b) maintenance of about 2,000 km of feeder roads covering almost 1002 of
the constructed feeder road network;
(c) equipment and some tools for the existing four labor intensive
brigades, for one bridge brigade, and the mechanized brigades;
(d) technical assistance: (i) to SRDR for implementing the proiect and
the training program; (ii) for a socio-economic impact study to monitor
the growth of traffic and analyze motives for trips generated, assess
the medium-term (10-year) needs for feeder roads in the country, and
monitor the pilot scheme for low-cost tracks; and (iii) for the
training center in Cotonou and for SEMTP; and
(e) future project preparation.
The project was expected to be completed by September 30, 1987.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Fourth Highway Proiect
3.01      The office building extension consisted of the addition of a third
floor to the two story building which was started under a previous project.
The works were awarded by an addendum to the original contract to a state-owned
contracting firm which secured the lnitial construction work. The structural
work was executed promptly but the interior finishing was extremely slow,
resulting in about a two-year delay. Since the contractor was state-owned, the
GOB was reluctant to take any remedial measures. The workshop renovation works
in Parakou and Nattitingou were also delayed by about one year until DRB decided
to cancel the contracts and continue the works by force account. In both of the
above cases, the delays greatly slowed the institutional reorganization programs
of DRB and SEMTP.
3.02      A training center was established in a renovated building near the
SEHTP workshop in Cotonou. The renovation works were executed by force account.
The training experts were professional teachers with poor practical experience.
Out of the forty man-months spent on their program, more than half had been
devoted to the preparation of training material and lecturing. The results of
this training program were so poor that the GOB had to develop a follow-on
program which was ultimately financed by the Third Feeder Roads Project then
under preparation.



3.03      Invitations to bid for equipment and supplies were sent out in
March 1981 and all the contracts were awarded in the first quarter of 1982.
Due to the GOB's adverse financial situation and its poor management capacity,
the Administration was late in disbursing t.e advance payments and this resulted
in long delays in delivery. Most of the equipment was delivered during 1983;
some essential pieces, however, remained blocked in the Port of Cotonou for more
than one year as a consequence of a dispute between the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
and the supplier. The DRB could not persuade the MOF to resolve the issue, and
the delay slowed down the gravel roads rehabilitation program.
3.04      The laterite rc. ds rehabilitation works continued without interruption
between the Third and th - Fourth Highway Projects. According to the consultant's
final report, 531 km of roads were rehabilitated which is somewhat more than
the 501 km included in the project at appraisal (see Table 1).  The Beninese
staff in charge of operating the mechanized brigades were assisted by an
efficient technical assistance team composed of a laterite road maintenance
specialist and a field mechanics expert.  A special program was developed to
maintain these roads which remained in a good condition in spite of two
successive  heavy  rainy  seasons.    The  rehabilitation  works  included  the
construction of small drainage structures which was successfully carried out by
force account. The construction of four large structures was awarded by LCB to
small Beninese contractors; these, however, did not receive special guidance and
suffered many difficulties in managing their contracts. First, the local banks
refused to prcvide the guarantees for the advance payments which were essential
for them to start the works, and, secondly, the administration was slow in
effecting the supervision and disbursing payments due. The local contractors
were unable to contend with these difficulties, and this resulted in substantial
delays.
3.05      The pavement rehabilitation works were awarded during the Third Highway
Project to a joint venture of a French contractor with a state-owned contracting
firm for the international road Cotonou-Hillacondji-Lome and the national road
Come-Lokossa-Dogbo. These works were continued without interruption under the
Fourth Highway Project; however, they were carried out in the absence of
supervising consultants whose contract was in the process of being renewed. The
CAA did not honor its commitment to prefinance part of the work so that at the
time of effectiveness of the Fourth Highway Project, invoices amounting to more
than US$3 M remained due to the contractor. The latter firm, being unpaid and
lacking supervision, and being politically influential due to association with
a state owned firm, did not pay much attention to work quality, which declined
steadily.
3.06      Shortly after the project  started,  deterioration on the already
rehabilitated sections appeared and increased to a point that it was decided to
concentrate on the Cotonou-Hillacondji road and reduce the work on the Come-
Lokossa road. Later on, in 1984, when all other project components were well
under control, the Association agreed to allocate the remaining uncommitted funds
for complementary strengthening works on the Cotonou-Hillacondji road.   The
closing date was consequently extended. Further, the OPEC Fund agreed to follow
the same policy and allocated US$700,000 for these strengthening works which were
tendered by ICB procedures.  A contract for about US$2 M was awarded to the same
contracting firm as on the previous works. Under this arrangement, heavy repairs
and resealing were carried out on about 76 km of road, including 15 km on the
Come-Lokossa road.  The works started in November 1986 and were completed in
January 1988. The closing date was once again extended. Currently, new failures
are appearing on sections not restored under this program.



3.07      The IDA contribution to the research program on the use of local
materials was modest (US$50,000) and was considered only as an incentive for
the GOB to finance this type of research.  The final report was presented in
late 1987, and should be useful to contractors in locating materials.
3.08      The  Credit Agreement provided  that  the  procurement  of  two new
weighbridges was conditional on the rehabilitation snd re-opening of the two
existing weighbridges in Parakou and Malanville. The new weighbridges were not
operational until mid-1987. Currently, all installations are in operation, but
no penalties are applied for operating overloaded vehicles. Efficient axle load
control can only be applied if the two neighboring countries to the north of Togo
and Benin closely coordinate their actions in that matter. Axle load enforcement
is difiicult and must be done on a regional basis.   This is now being done
through a study of tariffs, and a regional corridor transport study is also being
prepared.
3.09      The road safety program was expanded in the course of the project.
Bids were opened at the end of 1984 for the vehicle inspection center and its
equipment. Due to the continuous difficult financial situation of the GOB, the
contractors were not paid on time, and the works were delayed until the end of
1986. The National Center for Road Safety (CNSR) started work in December 1986
with the assistance of the specialist who prepared the program.  Its dynamic
and motivated manager is willing to expand the work program in the northern
provinces, and the time now seems favorable to review the situation and fix new
operational and budgetary objectives for the next several years.
3.10      The technical  assistance component was negotiated with the same
consultants who were responsible for technical assistance under the Third Highway
Project. The consultants were selected by the GOB in view of their excellent
prior performance.   Due to the gap between the Third and the Fourth Highway
Projects, the former team was no longer available, and the consultants had
difficulties to field a new team acceptable to the GOB. Three successive Mission
Chiefs were appointed to manage the project (para 6.01).
3.11      The  total  cost  of  the  project  was  estimated  at  appraisal  at
4,465.8 million CFA,  while  the  project  was  completed  at  a  cost  of
6,506.1 million CFA (Table 2).  The value of the US dollar to the CFA franc was
substantially higher during the years of project execution, which permitted the
execution of considerably more work than foreseen at appraisal, especially on
the rehabilitation of bitumen roads.   The financing plan at appraisal and
completion is shown in Table 3. The average value of the CFA franc was 331.9
to the US dollar.  The weighted value of the CFA franc to the US dollar, based
on IDA disbursements over the project life, was 373. This is reasonably close
to the average value of 331.9, especially if it is assumed that the Government's
contribution was spent at a somewhat earlier pace than IDA disbursements and thus
at a lower rate. On the other hand, IDA disbursements usually reflect processing
and submission delays. OPEC's disbursement schedule is not available.
B. Third Feeder Roads Proiect
3.12      The  road  construction works  were  started  by  force  account  in
January 1985.   The initial productivity was low, due to the fact that the
complementary equipment provided to reinforce the capacity of the labor intensive
brigades had not yet been delivered. However, productivity eventually increased
and the SRDR, impressed by this good result, proposed to increase the level of
mechanization.   The Association agreed, and a second lot of equipment was



procured. As a result, productivity improved above that originally expected.
Due to funding limitations, the works were stopped at the end of 1987, with about
85Z (714 km) of the appraisal targets met and within the scheduled time limit.
3.13      The construction of low standard tracks was lcng delayed due to
objections of some local remote communities to being linked with lower standard
tracks than other communities and, in addition, being made responsible for the
routine maintenance of these tracks. Eventually, out of the 150 km of tracks
scheduled, only 50 km were constructed. However, the GOB now favors a system
of such tracks which are adequate for the low traffic, consisting mainly of light
motorcycles.
3.14      Execution  of  the  feeder  road  maintenance  component  progressed
satisfactorily with increased productivity resulting from an increase in
mechanization. By 1987, about 94Z of the feeder road network of 2,000 km was
under maintenance. These results were considered satisfactory by the consultants
who noted that the overall condition of the network was good. However, this was
not sustained after project completion since no permanent financing source for
the maintenance budget could be arranged, and the newly created Feeder Roads
Maintenance Section in the SER could not be merged with the SRDR because of its
poor performance.  Action in this matter is being taken under the follow-on
Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation (TIR) Project now underway through the
establishment of a comprehensive maint nance plan.
3.15      Procurement of equipment and tools was implemented without problem.
The changes in construction technology resulted in a doubling of the expendi-
tures for equipment purchases. Amendments to Credit 1485-BEN and the Special
Fund 23-BEN were signed on November 20, 1987 in order to readjust the disburse-
ment schedules.
3.16      The technical assistance (TA) team was in place before the start of
the project so that the institutional objectives and the training component
could be carefully monitored and coordinated with field activities.   The TA
component was divided into two different parts, the first directly affected to
the SRDR and the second, addressed mainly to the DRB (para 2.08). As regards
SRDR, the objectives were to expand computerization, to improve administrative
operations and cost accountancy, and to help carry out the works in the field.
These objectives were achieved satisfactorily.
3.17      The main objective of the follow-on TIR Project was to assure a
continuity between it and the Fourth Highway Project, and to continue the actions
initiated but not achieved by the TA team on the Fourth Highway Project. Further
progress is needed on (a) the extension of the SRDR administrative computerized
system to the DRB Administrative Division; (b) the continuation of training
activities; and (c) the reorganization of SEMTP. These activities are now all
underway, and the Association agreed to extend for the duration of the TIR
Project, the experts involved in this program.   In addition to the initial
program, a Road Management Division was created in DRB and an equipment
maintenance section was reactivated in Abomey, at about 130 km north of Cotonou.
3.18      The socio-economic impact study was expected to be carried out by the
SRDR; however, a copy of the study has not yet been received.



3.19      The project cost eotimates at appraisal and completion are shown in
Table 5, while the financing sources at appraisal and completion are given in
Table 6.   The cost of the project was slightly higher than the appraisal
estimate. The main differences between the appraisal and actual costs are that
considerably more was spent on maintenance and equipment, and less on road
construction and periodic maintenance.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A. Fourth Highway Project
Paved Road Rehabilitation and Resurfacing
4.01      The vehicle operating costs used in the appraisal report are shown in
Table 4, Section A. A more recent appraisal 1/ using the Bank's HDM Methodology
with Beninese data and assuming a traffic mix of 752 light vehicles and 252 heavy
vehicles is shown in Table 1, Section B. Table 1, Section C shows the VOC in
the appraisal report converted to the same traffic mix. It assumes the roughness
index corresponds somewhat to the type of road, that is, the cost per km of
travelling over a 9,000 mm/km of roughness is about the same as the cost per km
for a barely passable b.rack.   The more  recent VOC using the Bank's HDM
methodology are more conservative.
4.02      The appraisal report states that both the Cotonou-Hilacondji and
Come-Dogbo roads were cat ryovers from the Third Highway Project and required
resealing of a remaining 49 km and reconstruction of 35 km, in stretches up to
3 km. The average traffic on the sections requiring reconstruction was 1,215 vpd
(1981), with a growth of 52 p.a. The average on the sections (Come-Dogbo Road)
requiring resealing was 465 vpd (1981). The rate of return for the entire 84 km
was expected to be 25Z. The Come-Dogbo Road (61.5 km) was evaluated in 1987 for
the Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Credit 1807-
BEN). Traffic ranges from 300-700 vpd. This evaluation projects an internal
rate of return of 302 when the rehabilitation is completed.
Rehabilitation of Laterite Roads
4.03      The final cost of the program for rehabilitating laterite roads is
about two thirds that estimated at appraisal (CFAF 1,367.2 million vs.
865.2 million -- Table 1).  There is no indication in the supervision reports
that the works were not carried out satisfactorily. This suggests that either
the costs at appraisal were overestimated or that all the works anticipated at
appraisal were not carried out. Approximately 200 km of the 530 km of the roads
rehabilitated under the program were included in the follow-on Transport
Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project. However, it is difficult
to assess the quality of the rehabilitation works now. The economic reevaluation
thus takes a very conservative approach and assumes that the works were not
completed to the appraised design standards. The economic reevaluation assumes
that regravelling was required every five years instead of every seven years;
no residual value was assumed for drainage (502 at appraisal); and while the
technical assistance costs were considered, these were cancelled out by the
residual value of the equipment. In addition, only 802 of the vehicle operating
1/   Staff Appraisal Report, "People's Republic of Benin, Transport Infrastruc-
ture Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project," April 30, 1987.



- 9 -
costs savings for the first year were applied with each subsequent year being
reduced by one half.  Average traffic growth for the project roads is 6.31,
slightly higher than that estimated at appraisal  (5Z).   Using the above
assumptions, the overall rate of return is 182 compared to the appraisal's
estimate of 341.
B. The Third Feeder Roads Proiect
4.04      A  reevaluation of the project applying the methodology used at
appraisal is not possible as neither the farm model data nor the working papers
describing the farm models and assumptions used at appraisal are available. A
socio-economic impact study, which is being carried out by SRDR, will collect
data relevant to the reevaluation of this project. The terms of reference call
for the calculation of the benefits and rates of return for similar feeder road
projects. SRDR has been requested to reevaluate the project roads using the data
from their study, following the approach outlined below.
4.05      The initial evaluation was based on the producer surplus approach,
using the assumption that agricultural production would increase if reliable
transport services were provided. The factors for the growth of this increased
production were the difference between the average population growth for the
country (2.59Z) and the average population growth for the provinces concerned
(ranging from 1.2Z to 2.01) 2/ plus increased yields for certain crops less the
costs of inputs for all crops. A subsistence area with below average rate of
population growth could, with proper incentives -- e.g., improved transport --,
increase its production to at least the average rate of growth for the entire
population.
4.06      The proposed approach to be used by SRDR would use the same factors
for the with- and without-project. From the information to be obtained from the
socio-economic impact study, the net value of production per typical farm by
province would be determined. The net value of production would exclude farm
and market losses as well as on-farm consumption. 3/ Where yields are increased,
the costs of inputs, e.g., fertilizer and technical assistance, would be
deducted. The net value of production without the project road over a ten-year
period (assuming periodic regravelling in year seven) would be deducted from the
with-project road net value stream and the difference compared to the investment
cost of the project road to arrive at the economic rate of return.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      During implementation of both projects, the Government's financial
position remained precarious.  The Association several times had to threaten
disbursement suspension because of non-payment of debt service. The financial
management of the two projects was the responsibility of the CAA, whose overall
financial capacity was low.
2/   Borgou 2.02;  Mono 1.2Z;  Oueme 1.2Z;  and Zou 1.21.
3/   The marketable surplus or the ratio of these losses and on-farm consumption
to total production from the socio-economic impact study would be compared
to those in the appraisal report which are:  Borgou North, 02;  Borgou
South, 31Z; Mono North, 182; Mono South, 122; Oueme North, 502; Oueme
South, 162; Zou North, 552; and Zou South, 301.



- 10 -
A. The Fourth Highway Project
5.02      The C M  did not honor its commitment to prefinance the civil works
carried out by contract without interruption during the period between the Third
and the Fourth Highway Projects.   This seriously handicapped the GOB in its
dealings with the bankrupt state contracting enterprise, and with the local banks
when it tried to help small Beninese contractors who needed a guarantee for
advance payments.
5.03      Regarding civil works carried out by force account, such as laterite
road rehabilitation and building renovation, performance was satisfactory. The
works were executed within the schedule and the cost estimate. The force account
works represented about 402 of total project costs.
5.04      The civil service suffered from a lack of stability.  At the beginning
of the project, the Director of DRB was suspended for about one year without
being replaced.   About one year after having returned to his job, he was
transferred to another service and replaced by the former Director of DRB who
had been removed about six years earlier. Managers of the SER, SEMTP and the
training center lacked experience. The Chief of SER, in charge of implementing
the project, was transferred to another service and replaced by a young but
inexperienced technician. Overall, institutional performance was poor.
B. The Third Feeder Roads Proiect
5.05      All the civil works were carried out by force account, and by the same
staff who were responsible for two earlier projects. Thus, the performance on
this component by experienced personnel was good indeed.
5.06      The other project components were mainly managed by the technical
assistance team. Unfortunately, the Chief of the Training Center and all its
Beninese trainers, who had been appointed during the implementation of the Fourth
Highway Project, were transferred to other services at the end of the project.
Thus, no lasting institutional benefits can be attributed to the project.
VI. CONSULTANTS' PERFORMANCE
A. The Fourth Highway Project
6.01      Following a gap of about five months between the Third and the Fourth
Highway Projects, the consulting firm selected to continue assisting the DRB
under the latter project had many difficulties in reassembling a satisfactory
technical assistance team (para 3.10).  Three successive Mission Chiefs were
appointed. The first left for health reasons about a month after his appoint-
ment. The second, who was inefficient, stayed on the job about two and a half
years despite the numerous protests and complaints by the Administration and
supervising Bank staff.   In hesitating so long before recognizing the poor
qualification of its employee, and replacing him, the consultants jeopardized
the outcome of the project.
6.02      Of the other experts assembled to provide technical assistance, few
had prior experience in Africa and they did not receive guidance from their team
leader who was unable to grasp what was expected of him.   Thus, there was
virtually no coordination of the work to be done.  The training experts, for



- 11 -
example, had been in the country ten months before any training was provided
under the project.   When the third team leader arrived, it was too late to
overcome the poor performance of the team.
B. The Third Feeder Roads Proiect
6.03      To  remedy  these  poor  results,  the GOB,  in agreement with  the
Association, decided to include further technical assistance in the Third Feeder
Roads Project, then under preparation, with the objectives of continuing
assistance to the training center, to help reorganize the DRB administrative
division, and restructure SEMTP.  The TA team in charge of these activities
performed well and they are continuing their work under the TIR Project.
6.04      Thanks to the efficiency of the SRDR in project preparation,  the
technical assistance team in charge of the Feeder Roads Project was in place at
the right time to continue the momentum developed under the Second Feeder Roads
Project.  They adapted readily to the new work technology for labor intensive
methods, increasing the productivity and, thus, the motivation of the SRDR staff.
The performance of these consultants was excellent.
VII. THE ASSOCIATION'S PERFORMANCE
A. The Fourth Highway Project
7.01      This project was a continuation of the works started under the Third
Highway Project. In agreeing to finance this component of the project without
calling for a new engineering and feasibility study, the Association failed to
properly evaluate the project. Despite the enormous advantage resulting from
the increase of more than double the dollar value in relation to the CFA, only
60Z of the appraisal targets under the paved road component was achieved. The
Association was wrong in agreeing with the GOB to continue the paved road
rehabilitation works with the same contracting joint-venture as before, and to
allow the work to proceed without the supervising consultants being present on
site (para 3.05).
7.02      The above decisions were made in a period of internal reorganization
in the Region, and many changes of supervising staff occurred at that time.
After this more or less confusing period, the Bank's supervision staff made
every effort to improve project performance.  The initial scope of the paved
roads works was scaled down to the 602 currently completed, and an engineering
study was requested for the remaining 402 of the alignment which crossed
difficult terrain.  In coordination with the cofinancier, OPEC, credits were
reallocated in order to permit all necessary repairs and resurfacing of most of
the sections already completea.  These works were awarded through ICB to the
same contracting firm which had previously carried out the works in association
with a Beninese state enterprise.
7.03      Despite efforts spanning two decades and a series of six projects, it
is difficult not to conclude that while progress on civil works varied from
mixed to good, progress on institution building and training has been less than
satisfactory. It is beyond the scope of this report to take a detailed look at
the effectiveness of technical assistance and training. A closer study may be
needed, not only of Benin, but for similar countries in Africa as well, to
determine whether IDA objectives are set too high and its programs too ambitious,
and what, if anything, can be done to achieve better results in institution



- 12 -
building in future.  This needs to be looked at in the light of a continuing
si.ortage of local currency which alro handicapped project execution, another
frequently encountered problem in West Africa.
B. The Third Feeder Roads Proiect
7.04      The Association's performance in monitoring the Third Feeder Roads
Project was mostly satisfactory.   The project was well prepared and was
implemented by an experienced and motivated team of Beninese in association with
competent TA experts. Problems which arose regarding feeder roads maintenance
were addressed effectively.   However, disbandment of the local staff of the
Training Center at the end of the project (para 5.06) was a step backwards. As
in many other countries, road maintenance is not yet considered a high priority
task, and the Association's efforts must be continued in the framework of the
on-going TIR Project.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      Both projects demonstrate the importance of having well coordinated
and motivated teams of local staff and competent technical assistance to
implement them.   In the case of the Fourth Highway Project,  the SER was
mismanaged and was assisted by an inefficient TA team leader. The project failed
in most of its institution building objectives. In the case of the Third Feeder
Roads Project, the experienced SRDR staff, which was well motivated by its
successful performance on earlier projects and associated with a compe tit TA
team, was fully successful.
8.02      Performance of the consultants on the Fourth Highway Project was
unsatisfactory, but the consultants or. the Third Feeder Roads Project performed
well. The former team provided a more useful completion report than the latter.
8.03      On both projects, work implemented by force account was successful,
particularly the rehabilitation of grav;el roads.  This type of work has been
traditionally implemented by force account, and local staff have long experience
in executing it.   They should not be discouraged by requiring that future
rehabilitation works be executed by contract.
8.04      Labor intensive methods were generally successful in Benin, although
as elsewhere, their effectiveness is limited (a) to areas where labor is readily
available; (b) to roads where a high degree of compacting is not required; and
(c) to road building which does not require the hauling of large quantities of
earthworks over long distances.   Institutional and staffing stability, and a
willingness to adapt work methods to the local situation, greatly contributed
to the success of the Feeder Roads Project.
8.05      The road safety program has been implemented, and Benin is now well
equipped to enforce axle load controls. But the legislation remains insuffi-
cient to dissuade the truckers from overloading their vehicles. Weight scales
are now operated full time, but no penalties are applied since there are no legal
provisions, and no physical facilities ixist to enforce the unloading of the
vehicles. The Government seems reluctant to go ahead in this matter unless Togo,
the competing neighbor country on the South-North axis to the land-locked
countries, follows the same policy. This matter is being carefully reviewed in
the light of these competing needs and existing agreements and lekislatlon in
the neighboring countries (para. 3.08).



- 13 -
8.06      The reevaluated rates of return for the rehabilitation of the paved
and laterite road components of the Fourth Highway Project are acceptable. A
reevaluation of the Third Feeder Roads Project is not possible because the 'data
used at appraisal are not available.
8.07      The Fourth HIghway Project demonstrates once again, the problems of
allowing state enterprises to bid on Bank work. Generally, state construction
enterprises in Africs do not perform satisfactorily; their workmanship is poor,
and quality is difficult to control as they use their political influence to
allow them to circumvent their contractual responsibilities.   Lastly, state
enterprises discourage private industry from bidding as it is generally realized
the state enterprises will get the job, usually by underbidding.  A contract
between a state enterprise and the state is not an arms length transaction; it
is the enterprise that benefits from its failure to p-operly perform, not the
state which is saddled with poorly built roads which it has to maintain.
8.08      A closer study may be needed, not only of Benin, but for similar
countries in Africa as well, to determine whether IDA objectives are set too
high and its programs too ambitioua, and what, it anything, can be done to
achieve better results in institution building in future.
8.09      Lessons learned include the following:  (a) even ongoing works from
an earlier project that are being financed under a new project should be
carefully reviewed to ensure that the design is satisfactory, costs are up-to-
date, and the works are justified; (b) works being executed by contract, or for
that matter, departmental forces, should be adequately supervised by on-site
staff; (c) other road construction methods than those employing fully mechanized
units can be made to work well if properly adapted to local conditions; and
(d) state enterprises should not be allowed to bid on Bank-financed civil works.
