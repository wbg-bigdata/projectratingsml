IIImplementing Agency    Ministry of Development and International Cooperation

  Amount                EURO 116.1million (US$l50 millionequivalent)

  Terms                  Commitment-linked, Fixed-Spread Loan (FSL) of EURO 116.1 million
                         (US$l50 million equivalent).       A capitalized front-end fee of EURO
                        580,500 (US$750,000 equivalent). The lendingrate applicable is six month
                        LIBOR plus a fixed spread for FSLs denominated in EURO. The loan
                        repayment period will be 16.5 years, including a five year grace period.
                        Interest and other charges will be payable semi-annually on February 15
                        and August 15 of each year. The final reimbursement date is August 15,
                        2021.

  Tranching             Two tranches of EURO 58.5 million each (US$75 million equivalent), the
                         first one to be disbursed after effectiveness and the second one 18 months
                         after effectiveness, following the Bank's review of policy actions
                        implemented as per the loan agreement.

                        The program will support mutually reinforcing development objectives:
                         (a)   maintaining a sound and reactive macroeconomic framework, in
                        particular by promoting fiscal consolidation and strengthening the medium
                        term fiscal framework;
                        (b) improving Tunisia's private investment climate and increasing private
                        investment opportunities; and
                        (c)    reinforcing the financial sector's capacity to finance growth, by
                        supporting initiatives to reduce the level of non-performing loans, further
                        strengthening the regulatory framework for bank intermediation, and
                        fostering development of contractual savings, especially in the insurance
                         sector.

                        Benefits would result from a stronger macroeconomic framework, from an
                        improved investment climate creating more opportunities for private
                        investment and from a better functioning and more efficient financial sector,
                        better positioned to support higher growth and investment. This should
                        contribute to better preparing the Tunisian economy to the challenges of its
                        insertion inglobal markets, o f the full roll-out of the Association Agreement
                        with the European Union and of progressive move towards full
                        convertibility of the Tunisian Dinar.

                        The main risks are an unfavorable exogenous and/or endogenous shocks, a
                        weakening drive for reform or slow pace o f change and technical capacity
                        constraints. The pace of reduction of the level of NPLs would depend on
                        improvements in the relationship between the banks and some key
                        corporate borrowers, which could be opposed by vested interests. Private
                        investors' reactions (both inthe on-shore and inthe off-shore sectors) to the
                        progressive evolution of the incentives framework will be key to comfort
                        the Government's reformist stance.

                                  TO THE REPUBLICOF TUNISIA




                                        I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The loan supports a reform program including actions to improve Tunisia's private investment
climate, strengthen competition, enhance corporate transparency and governance; take further steps to
improve the quality of banks' loan portfolios and reduce the amount of non-performing loans in the
banking sector, liberalize the insurance sector, while reinforcing the regulatory and supervisory
framework in securities markets and the insurance sector, and further strengthen the medium-term
macroeconomic framework. The proposed program is based on the work of the authorities inpreparing
the next (ll*) development plan and on the recommendations of recent Bank reports: the
                five-year
Financial Sector Assessment Program, the Development Policy Review and the Accounting and Auditing
Report on Observance of Standards and Codes.

2.      The loan supports Tunisia's macroeconomic stability.         Tunisia has demonstrated its firm
commitment to prudent and forward-looking macroeconomic policies and has established credibility
among international investors and domestic economic agents. Uncertainties in the extemal environment
and emerging competitive pressures could lead to pressures on the balance of payments by increasing
financing requirements or by temporarily raising the cost of borrowing on international markets. In
response to surrounding risks in the external environment, the authorities have strengthened the fiscal
framework and debt managementpolicies and stand ready to adopt additional measuresif necessary.

3.      The proposed operation would be the fourth in a series. The first ECAL, (ECAL I)      introduced
wide-ranging first generation actions aimed at promoting private sector development (PSD); the second
ECAL (ECAL, 11) supported improvements in the soundness, efficiency, and competitiveness of the
banking system. ECAL IIIconsisted of a broad range of second generation measuresaimed at enhancing
private sector development, pursuingfinancial sector reform and expanding it to the non-bank financial
sector, and supporting the liberalization of the telecommunications sector. The ECDPL IV i s designed
with the aim of furthering this set of reforms, in a de facto programmatic approach, with an emphasis on
financial sector development, in particular by removing impediments to the efficiency of the banking
sector stemming from the high level of non-performing loans. At the same time, the program supports
the creation of new opportunities for private investment, by improving the regulatory framework for
investment and facilitating market entry through the strengthening of competitionpolicy.

4.      The proposed loan is consistent with the base-case scenario reflectedinthe Bank Group Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tunisia discussed by the Executive Directors on June 3rd, 2004. The
proposed loan amount is in line with the level of development policy lending foreseen inthe CAS. The
proposed operation has been prepared in collaboration with the European Union (EU) and the African
Development Bank (AfDB) who will support the Government's program on the basis of a common action
matrix with the EUproviding a grant of EURO 78 million and the AfDB, expected to match the Bank's
loan of US$150million equivalent. The macroeconomic framework and performance indicators for this
operation have beendefined inclose collaboration with the Intemational Monetary Fund(IMF).

                                      11.       COUNTRY CONTEXT


A.       RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSINTUNISIA

5.       Thanks to a steady pace of structural reforms and sound macroeconomic management,
Tunisia experienced fast and sustained growth. Sustained structural reform efforts since the early
1990s, supported by the World Bank and other                   Figure 1 Average annual realGDP growth-Tunisia and mmparalon (in%)
multilateral institutions,   prudent macroeconomic            9

policies, and deeper trade integration in the global          8

economy, have created an enabling environment for             7

growth of the private sector             and improved         0

competitiveness of the economy'. Growth accelerated
to 5.2 percent during the Ninth Development Plan
(1997-2001), outpacing MENA and middle-income
countries' average, even though it was slower than in
other fast growing countries (Chile, Korea, Malaysia,
Mauritius, Thailand-see      Figure 1). Strong growth
has contributed to a sharp reduction in poverty                   1982-1986       1987-1991       1992-lSsB       1997-2001      2002-2003


between 1995 and 2000, with the core poor (thoie living below a lower poverty line, reflecting a
minimumconsumption expenditure level) accounting for only 4 percent of the population in2000.

6.       Growth has been resilient, even when Tunisiafaced an unfavorable external environment. In
2002, growth slowed to 1.7 percent, from 4.9 percent in2001, due to a drop intourism and manufactured
exports and severe drought for a third year in a row. Sluggish growth inthe EUand the prolonged effect
of September 11, 2001 on tourism and transport, have hampered export growth. But non-agricultural
GDP was resilient, growing by 3.5 percent, supported by construction and other services, especially
telecommunications. Thanks to favorable rainfall in the 2002/03 season, agricultural production
recovered strongly, by 21.5 percent, in 2003 and 9 percent in2004. This has boosted GDP growth to 5.6
percent in 2003 and 5.8 percent in 2004. However, reflecting weak domestic demand, non agricultural
GDP has grown in 2003 at the same pace as in 2002, below the goals set in Tunisia's Tenth Economic
Development Plan (2002-06), but has accelerated to 5.4 percent in 2004. GDP growth may slowdown to
5 percent in 2005, owing to a projected decline in agricultural GDP by 4 percent, although the recovery
in non agricultural GDP growth will continue at a rate surpassing 6 percent. Despite healthier growth,
private investment remains weak and in2004 has declined as a share of GDP for a thirdconsecutive year.

7.       Despite strong growth, unemployment remains high, at around 14 percent, reflecting
demographic pressures, the decrease in the employment intensity of growth, and increased
competition. Although demographic growth is slowing down, strong labor force growth i s expected in
the years ahead, because educational attainment i s improving while, at 26 percent in 2001, labor force
participation by women still remains low. Inthe coming years, tensions inthe labor market will also be
intensified by the shedding of labor out of agriculture (22 percent of total employment) and traditional
industries such as textile (10percent of total employment). While unemployment remains highest among
those with primary schooling or less (86 percent of the unemployed), job creation for skilled workers has
slowed in recent years, so that unemployment of people with formal education has increased. Sustained,


 At above 70 percent of GDP, Tunisia's trade flows (the sum of imports and exports of non oil goods and services)
indicate the highest degree of international trade integration among countries included in the EU Neighborhood
policy initiative.

                                                         - 3 -


high growth rates, of about 6.5 percent, will be needed to reduce unemployment. Growth of high-skill
sectors would also beneededto absorb the continuous flow of new graduatesto the labor force.


B.        MACROECONOMICOUTLOOK AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

8.       Forward-looking macroeconomic policies have helped preserve external and internal
balances. Despite strong GDP growth over the 1990s, prudent demand management helped bring
inflation down, to levels below those seen inother fast-growing comparators (Figure 2). Tunisia's current
account deficit-reflecting      the sizeable trade deficit, at      Figure2 :Tunisia-inflation and externalbalance (10902003)
over 10 percent of GDP-was           also kept under control,     15                                                                    1
at around 3 percent of GDP for most of the late 1990s.
However, the external current account deficit surpassed
4 percent of GDP in 2000 and 2001, and in early 2002,
the external shocks were further exacerbating the
pressures on the current account. The authorities
tightened fiscal and monetary policies, thus containing          -10
domestic demand pressures. The current account deficit           -15
was brought under control, also with support from                     io90       io92         io94       1996       1008     zoo0  2002

strong agricultural production, reaching 3 percent of GDP in 2003 and 2.1 percent of GDP in 2004.
Foreignexchangereserves have stabilized at the equivalent of three months of imports since early 2003.

9.       Fiscal consolidation has progressed, but a primary budget deficit still persists. After an
important fiscal consolidation effort during the 1990s, in 2000-2001 fiscal policy turned expansionary
and the primary budget deficit broadened to 0.7 percent of GDP. The fiscal stance was tightened in the
2002 and 2003 budgets, but the primary budget deficit remained at 0.5 percent of GDP in 2003, due to
the weakness of tax receipts. In 2004, the primary budget (excluding grants and privatization receipts)
turned into a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP, mainly resulting from additional non-tax receipts and other
one-off factors.2 The primary budget deficit will reach 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005, and its persistence
prevents a rapid reductionof public debt.



persistent primary budget deficit, public debt hovered at
around 60 percent during the 1990s (of which, 39                                 Figure3 :Foreigndebtin% of GDP (2001)

With foreign private debt representing an additional 13            60

percent of GDP, Tunisia's total foreign debt amounted              40
to 52 percent of GDP in 2002. The debt service ratio               20
was brought down to around 15 percent of exports in
recent years. Tunisia is among the few emerging market
borrowers that have investment grade rating. Prudent                "$<8       .\saP%o            .          *         ~        ~  Qae~    ~    ~    ~    G

  The non-tax additional receipts reflect 25 MD from the natural gas fee; 75 MD from premiums linked to treasury

reflecting one-off operations, also contributed to the improvement in fiscal balance.

                                                     - 4 -


11.       Monetary and exchange rate policies have supported macroeconomic stability, while
responding to changing conditions. The policy mix in Tunisia has traditionally relied on a prudent
monetary policy. Monetary policy was swiftly tightened in 2001, with the aim of better aligning credit
expansion with the growth in domestic demand. With current account pressures easing, monetary
conditions were relaxed in 2003. At the same time, targeting a constant real effective exchange rate has
contributed to maintaining a good level of competitiveness and the prudent budget management has
provided a necessary anchor for this exchangerate policy. The real exchange rate rule was implemented
in a more flexible manner in 2002 and 2003, as the government allowed some real exchange rate
depreciation in order to support Tunisia's ongoing trade liberalization and the preparation for a more
flexible exchange regime inthe future.

12.       Balance-of-payments exposure to changes in oil prices is limited, but the budget remains
vulnerable owing to remaining energy subsidies. Currently, higher oil prices have a negligible impact
on the external current account because Tunisia's energy trade i s about balanced. However, this i s slowly
changing, because exports of oil are on the decline, while domestic energy consumption i s growing.
Domestic prices for some energy products (especially LPG) are subsidized, so that, in the absence of
domestic price adjustments, increasesin the price of oil impinge on the budget through higher transfers to
the distribution companies. It i s estimated that, in the absence of price adjustment, a US$ 10increase in
the price of oil increasesthe budget deficit by about TD 350 million, or by 1percent of 2004 GDP. This
i s far from negligible, given that the actual deficit i s hovering at around 3 percent of GDP. To mitigate
the impact of higher oil prices on the budget, the government adjusted retail prices in early 2004 and
again inFebruary 2005. The 2005 budget i s basedon an assumption of US$45/barrel for the price of oil,
in line with the projections of the World Bank and the IMF.Under the US$ 45harrel assumption, the
cost of subsidies to the budget would be TD 480 million without corrective measures, but recent retail
price increases will bring the overall cost to the budget down to an estimated TD 200 million-thus
offsetting the impact of oil price hikes on the budget deficit. The Government stands ready to take
additional measures should developments duringthe rest of the year drive the price of oil beyondcurrent
projections.


                               111.     THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A.        GROWTH,EMPLOYMENT AND MACRO-ECONOMICPOLICY

13.       Reducing unemployment remains the priority of the Government, and calls for a significant
acceleration of growth, spurred by much higher private investment. In the years ahead, the need to
maintain a sound fiscal framework (see below) will limit the potential for job creation in the public
sector. Bolstering private investment and the creation of small and mediumenterprises i s thus the key for
stepped up job creation. At the same time, Tunisia will have to maintain strong productivity growth,
because improving competitiveness i s a prerequisite to meet the challenge of intense global competition.
On current trends in labor force growth and participation rate, reducing unemployment by about 3
percentage points in 5 years would call for growth of about 6.5 percent per year. All else equal,
especially regarding productivity growth, this would require a much stronger private investment effort-
an increase of its share in GDP of about 7 percentage points. The government i s aware of the challenge to
create opportunities for private investment and i s considering options to further improve the investment
climate.

14.       Greater integration into global markets will raise challenges,first, for the import-competing
manufacturing industries-the       first challenge that faces Tunisia i s to "extend" the offshore sector
performance to the rest of the economy, which will be exposed to increased competitive pressures with

                                                      - 5 -


the completion of the Association Agreement with the EU (AAEU). The regulatory framework of
investment incentives and trade facilitation, which currently discriminates in favor of the offshore sector,
will have to become more even and supportive to the onshore sector, in particular by lowering
transactions costs for this sector. Without proper changes inthe regulatory framework for investment and
a more predictable business environment, the onshore sector faces the risk of a serious setback as a result
of exposure to stiffer competition.

--and, second, for the traditional exporting sectors. The second challenge is to help exporting firms
strengthen their competitiveness, upgrade their market niches, and position into new, higher value added
exports, while improving the quality and reducingthe cost of services that facilitate trade. This will help
exporting firms reap more benefits from the free-trade zone with a 25-member EU, and deal with
upcoming threats. With the phasing-out of the Multi-fiber Agreement (MFA) quota system, Tunisia's
textile exporters will face stiffer competition from low-cost producers in traditional European markets.
They will need to upgrade their market niches and their ability to respond to rapidly changing market
demand, with more support from a much better transport and ICT infrastructure, supported inter-alia by
reduced barriers to entry in those sectors. This would call for bold steps in the liberalization of trade-
related services that still burden Tunisian exporters with high costs. Strengthening competition policy
and the quality of the regulatory framework of network industries and infrastructure services would
greatly contribute to these efforts.

15.     Taking early steps to achieve resolute medium-term fiscal consolidation would provide the
neededfiscal room for maneuver to deal with surrounding risks. After a fiscal tighteningin 2002, in
the face of external shocks, the fiscal stance has turned neutral inthe 2003 and 2004 budgets. However, a
constant fiscal consolidation effort should be maintained. The budget deficit (excluding grants and
privatization receipts) diminished to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2004, against 3.2 percent in 2003, but i s
anticipated to slightly increase to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2005. Ina context of sluggish fiscal receipts, the
fiscal balance has been preserved through a continuous squeeze of capital expenditures, to the potential
detriment of long-term growth. Healthy growth in the years ahead would offer a window of opportunity
for a more ambitious fiscal consolidation effort. This would call for creating an appropriate primary
budget surplus (central government, excluding privatization receipts and grants), and should be
underpinned by initiatives to rationalize public expenditure and enlarge the fiscal base as tax revenue
collection declines due to the final removal of tariffs on imports from the EU. An issue of particular
importance i s the management of the sizeable government wage bill, which, at close to 12 percent of
GDP, is among the highest inMENA.The large wage bill introduces rigidity inthe budget that limits the
fiscal room for maneuver when adjustment i s needed, typically leading to cuts in the public investment
budget, as in2002-03.

 16.    Main benefitsfrom fiscal consolidationwould include:

         Securing domestic finance for greater investment, by mobilizing more public savings, so as to
         minimize pressures on the external balance over the mediumterm.
         Reducing the level of public debt. This would further bolster the confidence of domestic and
         foreign investors. At 60 percent of GDP, public debt remains high by international comparison
         and possibly denies Tunisia a more favorable access to international capital markets.
     0   Creating enough room in the budget to: (i)       adjust to severe shocks; and (ii)
                                                                                          possibly conduct
         counter-cyclical action, to offset part of the impact of adverse external shocks.
     0   Creating room for expanding the social safety nets, to offset the social impact of structural
         changes due to deeper trade integration.

                                                      - 6 -


B.       TRADEREGIME

17.      The upcoming completion of the free-trade zone with the EU in 2008 is promoting private
sector development in a more competitive environment. Implementation of the tariff dismantling
schedule under the AAEU is on track, with around 55 percent of the tariff reductions already in place.
Tariffs have been totally dismantled for capital goods since 1996 and for raw materials and intermediate
goods since 2000. Import duties on consumer goods and imported goods that are also produced locally
have been cut by about one half and one fourth respectively by the end of 2001. Initiatives have beenalso
taken to rationalize and reduce tariffs on non-EU imports, in both the 2004 and 2005 budgets. The
number of custom duty rates has been reduced from 54 to 14 and their level has been reduced across the
board while tariff peaks have been eliminated. Moreover, the 2005 budget granted the government
regulatory powers to adjust trade tariffs on a discretionary basis (via a ``dbcret permanent"), instead of
having recourse to the budgetlaw.

18.      However, despite progress in nominal tariff reduction, the trade regime remains protected,
and Tunisia still lags behind in regulatory reform to open services to competition. Although recent
initiatives go inthe right direction, Most-favoredNation (MFN)tariffs are still highinTunisia compared
to other EUNeighborhood countries. Targeting tariff reductions that bring Tunisia's MFNtariffs as close
as possible to the EU's external tariffs for industrial products would be essential to prevent distortions
from possible trade diversion as a result of the free-trade zone with the EU. Most importantly, services
liberalization remains limited. While Tunisia has granted WTO commitments for tourism, financial
services and communication services, market opening i s proceeding slowly, and the absence of
commitments in other key sectors, such as the transport and distribution, i s of concern for
competitiveness. Finally, imports of several products, such as petroleum products, drugs, cereals, seed
oils, tobacco, alcohols, coffee, sugar, and tea, remain monopolized by state trading boards or public
 enterprise^.^ The government i s aware of the challenge of further promoting trade liberalization to take
fully advantage of Tunisia's deeper international trade integration and has committed to pursuing the
processinparallel with the evaluation of the impact of the free-trade zone with the EU.


C.       PRIVATEINVESTMENT CLIMATE

19.      The Government has maintained a long standing commitment towards promoting private
sector development. The Tunisian authorities have maintained a policy of generous privileges for
investments in selected economic activities and for exporting, by supporting the creation of "offshore"
firms. Over the years, this strategy has helped address the import substitution bias of Tunisia's trade
policy and thus contributed to promoting export-oriented growth. Measures have also been implemented
to reduce transaction costs (fast registration, reduction in the number of procedures and of customs
documents, new system of normalized and simplified documentation for external trade transactions).
Attention has also beenpaid to develop financing mechanisms to Small-and-Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
and start-ups. The Tunisian authorities have recently extended to 2007 the main investment advantages
granted to the export-oriented activities. They have in parallel also taken some discreet steps to reduce
the gap between the incentives framework for offshore companies and others, without laying out however
a broader vision of the overall investment promotion framework after 2007.

20.      Tunisia suffers nonetheless from a structural private investment gap.                     Despite solid
macroeconomic fundamentals, private investment remains compressed below potential, at around 14
percent of GDP (Figure 4). Several factors account for this situation: heightened business uncertainty,

  Dismantling of trading monopolies in products where domestic prices are subsidized (cereals) or administered at
below international prices (some petroleum products, coffee, tea, soybean oil), would call for appropriate
adjustments of domestic prices, which will require more time and preparation, especially inpetroleum products.

                                                         - 7 -




of strong government interference in the economy and                    1970.74 1975-79 198084 198569 1990-94 199599    1



21.      Tunisia has taken significant steps towards privatization but recent scheduled transactions
have been delayed or less successful. In the context of ECAL 111, the authorities have made public a
privatization program and a related timetable. Progress has been achieved in the meantime, including in
the context of ECAL III.        However, the divesture from the Socie'te' Nationale de De'veloppement des
Hydrocarbures has not proceeded as quickly as expected. In addition, the outcome of the privatization
process for the Banque du Sud was unsatisfactory, as no proposal was eventually filed.

22.      Against this background, the authorities have emphasized in the ldhdevelopmentplan their
commitment to further promote primate investment, higher-skill exports and services, while
facilitating the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. Liberalization initiatives inthe ICT sector
have started to pay off, with large pent up demand boosting growth especially of mobile communications
services. Promoting the liberalization agenda in the trade-related and employment creating services
would greatly help achieve the Government's goals for better competitiveness and catching up with the
front runners inthe knowledge-based economy. Among MENA countries, Tunisia appears relatively well
positioned in attracting investment and in the emergence of such a knowledge-based economy. It i s
however ina less favorable position than direct competitors in other developing regions.


D.        FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

23.       Tunisia presents an overall well-developedfinancial sector, even though the banking sector
remains the key source of finance for the economy. It has also put in place a rather satisfactory legal
and institutional supervisory and regulatory framework, although enforcement remains an issue.
Important strides have been achieved, with support of ECAL ll(banking sector) and ECAL 111(insurance
sector) operations, to put the banking sector on a more sound footing, by making progress in absorbing
non-performing loans of public enterprises, and improving the non-banking financial sector, with a far-
reaching revamping of the insurance sector framework. However, market reaction has so far not been as
positive as expected (inparticular for life insurance).


4 Examples of lack of transparency and predictability of the regulatory framework include: the process for obtaining
prior authorization for private sector investments in the sectors where private investment i s restricted and for
majority ownership of Tunisian firms by foreign investors; the process of limiting VAT reimbursements to non-
exporting firms (cconshore), sector), which are submitted to the unpredictability of fiscal controls; the absence of
sufficient safeguards for taxpayers in terms of fiscal examinations and claims and the absence of administrative
appeal processesfor taxation matters; the inconsistent way by which auditing rules are applied to firms which borrow
significant amounts; the absence of a legal framework on concessionswhich would clarify the rule of engagement for
private firms participating in infrastructure investments.

                                                     - 8 -


24.     A key impediment for Tunisia's financial sector development remains the level of non-
performing loans in the banking system. Despite progress over the 199Os, the level of non-performing
loans (NPLs) is still large, at 23.6 percent of commercial bank total claims in 2004, according to Central
Bank of Tunisia provisional estimates. Recent trends have not improved the situation, as NPLs
experienced a 17 percent increase from 2001 to 2003 - while the claims under litigation were
experiencing a 22 percent decrease over the same period. Non-performing loans of the services sector
represented 50 percent of total in 2002. It i s recognized that, on current trends, the stock of NPLs will be
only marginally reduced by 2008 (to an estimated 18 percent of total bank assets, from 22 percent in
2003). Owing to heavy reliance on real estate collateralPven though its liquidity i s doubtful-the      level
of provisioningof these NPLs stands low, at 49.2 percent in 2000 for commercial banks, and has recently
decreasedto 45 percent in 2004, according to Central Bank of Tunisia provisional estimates. HighNPLs
increase the cost of bank intermediation, and imply inefficient credit decisions, highly leveraged
borrowers and poorly performingprojects. Realestate guarantees also posefinancial risks to the banking
system because they are illiquid and possibly overpriced-in       view of the questionable viability of some
loss-making borrowers (especially inthe tourism sector). By reducing risk-taking, the high level of NPLs
has also reduced the banks' ability to finance private investment (including SMEs), in a situation where
securities market have not so far been used as alternative funding sources. Drawbacks in the availability
and quality of financial information (in particular for non-listed companies and family-owned
conglomerates), insufficiencies in the design of corporate and credit registries, lack of enforcement of
corporate governancerequirements also weaken the quality of credit assessment and risk managementby
banks.

25.     The development of securities market has been hindered by excessive reliance on easy bank
financing for large companies, and by weaknesses in Tunisia's corporate sector. Corporate ownership
in Tunisia is characterized by a strong prevalence of family-owned business (and of family-owned
holdings), which are more than often wary of diluting their control and of adopting transparency
requirements. Improving transparency of these family-owned businesses and holdings i s necessary,
including to encourage more accurate and informed risk-taking behaviors by the banking sector. In
addition, this corporate ownership structure so far relying on lending and bank financing coupled with
the relatively small size and young age of the average Tunisian enterprise (in terms of both capitalization
and turnover) have impeded the development of securities markets. At the same time, the weak corporate
governance framework, with insufficient protection of minority shareholdersand low quality of financial
disclosure and accountability requirements for corporate managers and directors, has not contributed to
promote confidence in the integrity of the securities market. The conclusions of the auditing and
accounting ROSC provide strong evidence of the need for reform to improve trust and confidence in
financial information. The absence of sanctions of key securities crimes (insider trading for instance)
and more broadly the weak enforcement of the current regulatory framework also impair investor
confidence. The limited scope of the privatization program so far, which has not privileged public
offerings and remains timid in terms of opening the capital of public utilities, and the limited role played
by contractual savings and collective investment schemes have also impeded the development of capital
markets.

26.     Strengthening the soundness of the banking system, and improving the diversification of
sources of finance is key to ensuring adequate finance for private investment. The Government has
taken important steps to strengthen the supervision of the banking system, absorb non-performing loans
of public enterprises in 1997, and modernize the infrastructure and the regulatory framework of financial
markets. But important elements remain in the financial sector reform agenda. Reducing the level and
improving provisioning of non-performing loans i s a key element, because it would hedge major risks
posed to the banking system by excessive reliance on illiquidreal estate guarantees. This would also help
reduce the cost of financial intermediation and improve access to finance by sustainable SMEs. The
authorities have also engaged a reflection on the possibility of a public plan of support to the tourism

                                                    - 9 -


sector, which would, in their view, contribute to decrease the level of NPLs. At the same time,
energizing the non-bank segments of the financial system i s key to promoting diversification of the
sources of finance for private investment; better mobilizing long-term savings; reducing refinancing and
currency risks for public debt; and avoiding overstretching of the banking system that has served until
now as the major conduit of investment financing. Rebalancing the sources of finance towards greater
access to capital market financing with an increased supply of own funds and lowering of enterprise
leverage would also contribute to redirecting part of bank financing towards smaller enterprises.
Improved governance, both of domestic banks and non-financial enterprises, along with better corporate
transparency and financial disclosure, are at the core of the reform agenda. Reforms would be mutually
reinforcing: with little progress on the banking front, banks would keep taking limited risks, directing
credit inpriority to the safest large enterprisesthat would be diverted from seeking finance on the capital
markets.


                  IV.     BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

A.       LINKTOCAS

27.      ECDPL IV is expected to support the Governmentof Tunisia in addressing thefirst challenge
identified by the CAS: strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more
competitive, internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the Tunisian
economy. Inline with the expectations laid out in the CAS, ECDPL IV intends to contribute to four of
the CAS outcomes under this objective: improved incentives systems and increased transparency of the
regulatory framework; reduced transactions costs for firms, leading to increased production and exports;
a banking sector more responsive to the needs of the private sector, increased budget flexibility, and
better fiscal mobilization to reduce public debt.


B.       COLLABORATIONWITH OTHERDONORSAND THE IMF

28.      ECDPL ZV is being prepared jointly with the European Commission and the African
Development Bank, building on the overall successful experience under previous ECALs. Intensive
coordination has taken place from the outset, with dialogue on the diagnostics and on the key policy
actions to be supported. All preparatory missions have been jointly conducted. Inaddition, drawing the
lessons of ECAL III,ajoint policy matrix will be the common reference for disbursement of the various
tranches.

29.      The WIF has been closely involved in the preparation of the operation, especially on the macro-
economic framework, the trade agenda, and the restructuring of the banking sector. The macroeconomic
framework underpinning the program has been elaborated in consultation with the IMF mission to
Tunisia for the Article IV consultation.


C.       RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANK OPERATIONS

30.      ECDPL I V i s strongly related to the series of three previous ECALs, building on their
achievements and on the lessons learnt from their implementation. As far as on-going operations are
concerned, the Export Development Project IIpursues objectives which are complementary and cross-
reinforcing with those of ECDPL IV,by targeting trade facilitation and reducing hurdles to international
trade.

                                                  - 10-


D.      LESSONSLEARNED

31.     Zn its Project Performance Assessment Report on the three Economic Competitiveness
Adjustment Loans (ECALs) in Tunisia, OED noted that the ECAL programs successfully promoted
policy reforms. Substantial financial sector reforms were achieved, as well as the removal of some of the
disincentives for investment and the privatization of public enterprises and banks. The implementation
of the AAEU led to an economy considerably more open to the outside world. The main areas of
structural reform supported by the ECALs contributed critically to the long run competitiveness of the
Tunisian economy.

32.     According to OED, the main lessons to be drawn for the series of ECALs are:

        Tunisia's successful economic performance was due to three attributes: ownership and broad
        political consensus, a well-developed human resource base, and a stable macroeconomic
        environment.
        Experience in privatization and the financial sector shows the need for the Bank to be flexible.
        Developmentpartners should stay the course and show flexibility intheir support, provided there
        i s evidence of genuine and sustainedreformefforts. For example, by accepting partial reforms in
        some areas, and building on partial successes to deepen them in subsequent operations, the
        support from the Bank and other partners was ultimately effective. Patience, perseverance and
        flexibility paid off.
        An important lesson for other small emerging countries seeking to lay the foundations for
        sustainable growth and poverty reduction i s the success of Tunisia in creating a competitive
        economy by the coordinated use of macro and structural policies and reforms.

33.     Inaddition, the Bank identifiedthree design-related lessonsfromECAL III:

        The need to set clear and precise (measurable) loan conditions.
        The need to step away from "transactions-related" loan conditions, in the context for instance of
         state divesture.
        The need to avoid sector-based tranches as they complicated the disbursement mechanisms and
        didnot allow the Bank to accompany the progressive implementationof the reformprogram.


E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

34.     ECDPL ZV builds on sound analytical underpinningsfor all its components, resultingfrom
extensive dialogue with the authorities. The Development Policy Review (DPR) undertaken in parallel
to the CAS preparationprovides an overall picture of the challenges facing Tunisia bothinterms of fiscal
management and policy mix and of the structural reforms and a detailed analysis of the main sector
reforms to be undertaken to address these challenges. In the financial sector, the Financial Sector
Assessment Program provides an in-depth analysis of the Tunisian financial sector, focused on the key
stability risks and on the conditions for further development. These analyses were complemented by
studies undertaken in the context of ECAL I11focused on the non-performing loans, which provided an
up-dated picture of the related issues and reviewed various options to accelerate the reduction of the
stock and inflows of non-performing loans. On the investment climate, the Private Sector Development
Strategy prepared in 2000 continues to provide useful indications on the challenges facing Tunisia. It had
been usefully up-dated and complemented by the FIAS study realized in the context of ECAL 111,
notwithstanding the differences of points of views with the authorities on some of its recommendations.
On top of these broad analyses, ECDPL N also builds on more targeted ESW, such as the accounting
and auditing ROSC for instance. In addition, several studies (capital market development, insurance

                                                          - 11-


market development, debt strategy) were used to design sub-components of the proposed reform
program.

A.        OPERATIONDESCFUPTION

Objectives and Structure of the Program

35.       Theprogram will support mutually reinforcing development objectives:

   (a) maintaining a sound and reactive macroeconomic framework, in particular by promoting fiscal
          consolidation and strengthening the mediumterm fiscal framework;
   (b) improving Tunisia's privateinvestment climate and increasingprivate investment opportunities;
   (c) reinforcing the financial sector's capacity to finance growth, by supporting initiatives to reduce
          the level of non-performing loans, further strengthening the regulatory framework for bank
          intermediation, and fostering development of contractual savings, especially in the insurance
          sector.

36.       ECDPL ZV builds on the achievements of previous adjustment operations supported by the
World Bank and other donors. A number of reforms will be pursued with support from ECDPL N,
based on measures initiated inthe context of ECAL lTI and previous programs (see Box 1).Most notable
among these reforms are: further steps in banking sector restructuring (increases in provisioning,
reduction in the level of NPLs, improved risk-taking behaviors); additional improvements in the
relationship between tax payers and the tax administration (VAT reimbursement mechanisms);
enhancements in the financial disclosure framework. In addition, in the logic of the de facto
programmatic approach under the series of ECAL operations, ECDPL IV intends to pave the way for
further reforms to be supported by future programs, particularly with a view to further strengthening the
investment climate, by reforming the system of investment incentives and pursuing liberalization
initiatives -in line with the objectives set out by the authorities and the CAS.

37.       To address these challenges, the project will include measures in three components:
macroeconomicframework; investment climate;financial sector development. All three components
will be reflected in each of the two tranches of the operation. Given the mixed experience under ECAL
III, proposedoperationwouldcomprisetwo"horizontal" tranches,eachcoveringallthecomponents
     the
 of the operation, so as to better reflect the progressive sequencing in the implementation of the reform
program. Inview of the policy priorities outlined above, horizontal regulatory reforms to strengthen the
 environment for private sector development, and reforms aimed at restructuring and privatizing public
 enterprises will be highly complementary and mutually reinforcing. However, these initiatives will need
 to be sequenced appropriately. The proposed program will support in priority efforts to deepen key
 horizontal regulatory reforms, with the aim of strengthening the investment climate and lay the
 groundwork for more successful public enterprise restructuring and commercial operations inthe future.

 38.      The project will          encompass a substantial reinforcement of                     key institutions, by:
 (a) improving the enforcement of the competition policy by strengthening the related institutions
 (Competition Council); (b) enhancing the role of the financial sector supervisory bodies and their
 coordination mechanisms; and (c) improving the transparency and decision-making processes of several
 Government of Tunisia bodies (public debt managementauthorities, tax authorities).


 Maintaining a Sound Macroeconomic Framework

          i. Medium-termprospectsandpolicygoals

 39.      The medium-term macroeconomic framework for the program assumes a generally benign
 external environment, despite a gradual projected increase in interest rates. It i s assumed that
 undisrupted growth will be maintained in the EU over the period covered by the program, providing
 overall support to Tunisian exports. No major terms-of-trade shock or reversal of capital flows i s
 foreseen, with oil prices evolving according to World Bank projections. International interest rates are
 projected to gradually increase as from 2005, in line with World Bank projections for the global
 economy. Assuming a strong macroeconomic framework will be maintained, the spreads of Tunisian
 bonds will remain unchanged. Domestic interest rates will follow an upward trend, with a somewhat
 increasing premium over international rates to reflect the need to offer attractive enough returns to
 domestic savings in the context of a progressive easing of restrictions on capital flows-especially to
 foreign investment by residents. The macroeconomic framework assumes a stable real exchange rate,
 despite possible pressures on the external current account as a result of the completion of the free-trade

                                                        - 13 -


zone with the EU or the removal of the MFA quotas. The need of offsetting real exchange rate
movements will be inversely related to productivity and competitiveness gains resultingfrom structural
reforms pursued by the Government.

40.      The medium-term framework assumes a stepped up pace of structural reforms. Accelerated
reforms, supported by the proposed program, will pave the way for healthy growth, despite increased
international competition, with GDP growth reaching 6 percent by 2007. Non agricultural GDP growth
could accelerateto a projected 6.4 percent by 2007, from an estimated 5.4 percent in2004. Exports could
grow steadily due to the development of new markets, although at a more moderate pace due to stiffer
competition as a result of the removal of MFA quotas. Improvements inthe business environment could
lead to a gradual increase of the investment-to-GDP ratio by more than 1percentagepoint of GDP over
2004-07. However, given the continuing strong growth of the labor force, and assuming no growth of
employment inthe public sector and agriculture, the unemployment rate will be reduced only marginally,
to slightly below 13 percent by 2007 from 13.9 percent in2004.

41.      Continuedstructural reform efforts andprudent demand management will help keep inflation
and the current account broadly under control. Inflation, as measuredby the GDP deflator, i s expected
to recede to 3 percent in 2005, from 3.8 percent in 2004, and remain contained to this level thereafter,
due to a prudent policy mix, the favorable impact of tariff dismantling on EU imports and the effect of
increased competition, particularly in the service sector. The external current account will also face
pressures owing to: (i)   the impact of the tariff reductions associated with the completion of the AAEU;
(ii) needtoincreaseimportsoncapitalandintermediarygoodstosustaingrowth;(iii) impactof
    the                                                                                              the
the loss of export market share associated with the removal of the MFA quotas and the possible loss of
market share in t~urism.~    However, reflecting a continuing improvement in competitiveness, thanks to
structural reforms to be supported by ECDPL N and future programs, and sustainedfiscal consolidation
efforts, the deficit of the current account could be maintained at around 3 percent of GDP on average
during 2006-07.

42.      A continuingfiscal consolidationeffort will help reduce Tunisia's public debt to GDP ratio,
which remains high by international standards. The proposed medium-term fiscal framework for the
program assumes a relatively moderate but constant fiscal consolidation effort, with the primary fiscal
balance (excluding privatization receipts and grants) turning to zero in 2007 and into a surplus as of the
2008 budget, from a projecteddeficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in2005. This will help mitigate pressure on
the current account and also support the reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. The fiscal
consolidation factored inthe macroeconomic framework will reduce the public debt to GDP ratio to 58.3
percent by 2007, from 59.5 percent in 2004. Foreign debt in percentage of GDP will be reduced to 51.5
percent of GDP by 2007, from 62.9 percent in2004.

43.      Theprojected fiscal consolidation in 2006 and 2007 could be achieved through expenditure
savings and enhanced revenue mobilization. Efficiency gains in public expenditures could be realized
through savings on low-value programs, with support from the gradual introduction of medium-term
expenditure planning and performance-based budgeting. The World Bank i s providing support to the
Government's initiatives inthis area through the ongoing Public Expenditures Review (PER).Enhanced
revenue mobilization i s expected to be achieved through the simplification of tax rates, broadening the
base of the VAT; and the reduction of tax exemptions and preferential tax regimes, with support from
initiatives basedon the tax reform study to be conducted inthe context of the proposed program.


 Tunisian tourism growth i s losing steam, in spite of the recent economic recovery. Tunisian tourism sector i s losing
market share owing to more competitive tourist destinations in the region, such as Egypt and Turkey. In addition,
total revenues per visitor are on decline and remain considerably weak when compared with competitors, such as
Morocco.

           11.  Policy measures

44.        To assist Tunisia in its efforts to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework, the program will
support the implementationof the following macroeconomic policy measures over the period2005-06:

i) Setting appropriate goals for fiscal consolidation and performance by: (a) reducing the primary
budget deficit, to achieve an agreed fiscal consolidation that will help accelerate the reduction of the
public debt to GDP ratio; and (b) enhancing revenue mobilization through the simplification of tax rates,
broadening the base of the VAT; and the reductionof tax exemptions and preferential tax regimes. Inthis
regard, the program will support the preparation of a comprehensive assessment of the Tunisian tax
system.

ii) Strengthening medium-term expenditureplanning. The budget is currently prepared with a one-year
timeframe perspective, limiting the ability of the authorities to factor in medium-term risks and
opportunities stemmingfrom the evolution of the international and domestic environments. The program
will support the introduction of a rolling, medium-term budget framework by 2006, as part of the
 "Budget Economique", prepared annually to review the execution of the five-year Development Plan.
This will also help improve the quality of the annual budget formulation. The medium-term budget
framework will envisage a positive primary fiscal balance (excluding grants and privatization receipts) as
of 2008. The Public Expenditure Review that i s being conducted in FY05 will help the Tunisian
authorities to define the contents and preparation process of the medium-termbudget framework.

                                                   - 15 -


iii) Strengtheningpublic debt management. Strengthening public debt management will benecessary to
reduce debt service over the medium-term. Public debt management i s currently scattered across three
different administrative units, making it difficult to develop a more integrated view of the public debt
portfolio and implement a more active risk management strategy. The policy measures supported by the
program include: (a) the setting up of a middle ofice in the Ministry of Finances specialized in the
formulation of public debt management strategy; and (b) presentation of an action plan to consolidate
debt management functions into a single entity. These measures aim to ensure a better coordination
among the different administrative units currently responsible for public debt management: the Ministry
of Finance, the Central Bank of Tunisia and the Ministry of Development and International Cooperation.

Strengthening the Private Investment Climate

45.      ECDPL ZV will support measures to improve the investment climate and create more
opportunitiesfor private investment. The programwill buildon three pillars:

     0   To support new businessopportunities, it will focus on:
         -   facilitating primary investment, in particular in activities targeting markets still sheltered
             from competition, yet with scope for efficiency gains, growth, andjob creation. Inanumber
             of activities-generally  in the on-shore sector-general   restrictions apply to investment by
             bothdomestic and foreign investors, which i s subject to prior authorization. Despite steps to
             reduce the number of such administrative controls, 260 activities still remain restricted. The
             authorities have announced a plan to reduce the number of prior authorizations, by 90
             percent by 2009. They have accepted in the context of this program to accelerate this
             process to reduce the number of authorizations to no more than 120 by 2006. The program
             would support substitution of "codes of duties" / "cahiers des charges" for prior approvals.

     0   To facilitate businesscreationand operations, the programwill aim at:
         -   easing the financial conditions for creating a company, in particular by reducing the
             minimumamount of capital requiredat registration.
         -    improving the relations between the corporate tax-payers and the tax authorities. An
             increase in the number of companies benefiting from accelerated VAT reimbursement will
             be supported, by targeting all companies presenting certified accounts. Inthis context, this
             program will support a re-balancing of VAT rates and an increase of the VAT
             reimbursement to 100percent as of 2008, on the basis of the recommendations of the study
             on tax reform.     Efforts to improve the relationships between the tax authorities and
             companies will be also supported, by tackling existing practices that remain below
             internationalbest practice. Steps inthis direction have been undertaken by the enactment of
             the Code of Fiscal Rights and Procedures supported by ECAL ITI. The operation will
              support a change in the composition of the Commission on fiscal offences, to increase its
             independence.

         To strengthen competition and facilitate market entry and efficiency, the programwill support:
         -    enhancing the institutional framework and enforcement of competition policy. The program
             aims at improving the implementation and enforcement of the existing Competition law,
             which is broadly satisfactory, in particular by enhancing the authority and the autonomy of
             the Competition Council. It will also grant the Competition Council's ability to initiate
             cases, while considerably strengthening its human and financial resources. Finally, the
             responsibilities of the Competition Council and the regulatory / supervisory authorities in
             the regulated sectors will be clarified by law.

46.    At the same time, the program will pave the way for the more fundamental revision of the
investment incentivesframework that will have to take place with the completion of the Association
Agreement with the EU. Inorder to preparethis revision, the project will support a comprehensive study
of the Tunisian tax regime, which would inform the preparation by the Government of an Action plan
covering the overall tax framework (VAT and corporate taxation in particular), with a view to
harmonizing the incentives system. This study, to be realized in close collaboration with the IMF,will
build on existing analysis (such as the FIAS study) but will adopt a broader perspective by considering
together all the elements of the tax policy (personal taxation, VAT and corporate taxation), in order to
have a comprehensive view of the resulting incentives framework and of the relationships between these
elements.

Promoting Financial Sector Development

47.    In thefinancial sector, the program will, in priority, aim tofacilitate the restructuring of the
bunks' NPLportfolio. Inthis context, main initiatives to be supported would include:

        -     increasing provisioning and strengthening incentives for loan write offs, by enhancing
              prudential regulations related to provisioning shortfalls (reduction of current limitations on
              the amount of tax-exempt profits that can be used for provisioning; compelling banks to
              cover provisioning shortfalls in excess of their annual earnings; suppression of conditions
              for loan write-offs, clarification of the modalities for transfer to existing Asset Management
              Companies and improvements inthe efficiency of these AMC).
        -     an analysis of the NPL stock, with specific attention to the tourism sector, so as to better
              assess the quality of the underlying guarantees and collateral and agree on a strategy to
              dispose of the NPLs.
        -     analysis of the tools to deepen and accelerate restructuring of the NPL portfolio, including
              a study at the individual bank level of the quality of the NPL stock, a review of the
              effectiveness of the existing legal framework, in particular following the revision of the
              Code of Civil and Commercial Procedures (Code des Prockdures civiles et commerciales),
              and of the qualityhmpact of its enforcement. This analysis will inter-alia aim at improving
              the banking regulator's toolkit to foster enhanced provisioning, in particular by developing
              comparisons between banks' provisioning practices.

48.     Inview of the structural nature of the NPLs,the studieswill be conducted with the aimof setting
the conditions for more decisive actions on the older NPLs, around three main options: improving loan
recovery by realizing the associated collateral; transferring the claims to independent asset recovery
companies; and increasing provisioning to 100 percent. The program will require the Central Bank of
Tunisia to strengthen prudential supervision as appropriate for banks to increase provisioning of NPLs,
including inexcess of earnings in2004 and 2005, to cover provisioning shortfalls assessedby the Central
Bank. This will also require attention to be paid to the role and contribution of asset recovery companies,
buildingon the lessons learned from the ones currently inplace - which are almost all bank subsidiaries
-and amending as appropriate the related legal framework. This should contribute to improving the
banks' balance sheets at a faster pace, and without relying excessively on the impact of a possible
resumption of growth. The program will support the realization of such a study in the second tranche,
with concrete action to also be taken as part of the secondtranche measures.

49.     The additional steps considered in the program will consolidate measures already adopted over
the past years, with support by the World Bank, to improve the legal framework and gradually reduce the
NPL stock. The proposed measures will create a more conducive environment for accelerated
restructuring of the NPL portfolio, while more in depth analysis of the quality of real estate guarantees,

                                                    - 17 -


to be conducted with support from the program, is expected to help design stronger and more resolute
interventions over the mediumterm.

50.     At the current juncture the authorities are concernedthat stronger measures to clean-up the banks
balance sheet may have a negative impact, across-the-board, on the financing of the economy by the
banking sector. They are concerned, in particular, that SMEs may be disproportionately affected, with a
negative impact on economic growth and job creation. However, more decisive action on NPLs will
strengthen bank balance sheets and i s expected to improve risk-taking behavior. This i s indeed likely to
translate into more rigorous risk-screening by the banking sector, including on Sh4Es. However, at the
same time, as provisioning needs will decrease, a reduced level of NPLs will free up bank resources for
extending credit to sound and productive new investments, in support of improved risk taking behavior
by banks.

51.     ECDPL IV will also support the implementation and enforcement of the recent improvements
to the securities market and insurance sector regulatory and supervisoryframeworks

        -     in the insurance sector, ECDPL IV would aim to: (i)strengthen the efSiciency of the
              insurance regulator (in particular its autonomy in the perspective of achieving full
              independence); (ii) the insurance sector toforeign investors, by lifting the restriction
                                   open
              on majority shareholding of foreign investors in insurance companies; this measure i s
              expected to strengthen competition in the sector and promote an increased efficiency of
              Tunisian insurance companies; and (iii)     secure the implementation of the action plan on
              automobile insurance agreed in the context of ECAL III(including the related regulated
              automobile insurance premia increases). The programwould also support measures to tackle
              more aggressively the restructuring of the still ailing insurance companies - including the
              ones where unanticipated weaknesses in technical provisions have been identified. The
              project would also aim at improving the operations of all insurance companies - so as to
              bolster public trust intheir capacities and thereby foster the development of life insurance.
        -     to promote domestic securities market development, the program would aim to strengthen
              the authority of the regulator and its enforcement tools, but also to improve trust in the
              market, in particular by reinforcing market integrity. The program could also support
              measures to promote the depth of the markets, by improving public debt management (see
              macroeconomic component), developing new products (mutual funds), and enhancing the
              transparency of transactions.

52.     Thefinancial component of the operation would support enhanced availability and quality of
financial information-a key underpinning of a sound financial system. Key initiatives would
include:

     0  improving the quality of the accounting standards and bridging the gap with international
        standards, in particular for consolidated corporate accounts-based       on the recommendations of
        the ROSCreport,
        enforcing the transparency requirements for companies that obtain significant amounts of bank
        credit,
     0  enforcing the transparency and accounting requirements for non-listed companies, with the aim
        of reducing the "transparency gap" with listed companies that currently constitutes a disincentive
        for listing,
     0  improving the availability of financial information to the general public by sanctioning related
        failures.

53.     The operation could inter-alia support the law on financial security currently prepared by the
authorities as a main instrument to strengthen the regulatory framework, and promote more effective
corporate governance. It could also support a reinforcement of the accounting profession. The
conclusions and recommendations of the ROSC on accounting and auditing have largely been taken into
account inECDPL IV.


B.      LOANAMOUNT AND TRANCHING

Loan Amount and Tranching

54.     The proposedloan, inthe amount of EURO 116.1 million (US$150 million equivalent), will be a
two-tranche operation disbursed in equal tranche of EURO 58.5 million (US$75 million equivalent), and
covering the period2005-06.

55.     One important issue i s to preserve an appropriate balance between the first and second tranche,
including making sure that the first tranche supports a critical mass of concrete measures. A first tranche
would therefore be disbursed upon effectiveness, and the second tranche before the closing of the loan
scheduledfor June 2007.


Conditionsof Tranche Release

56.     The conditions for tranchereleasefor this operationwould support three mainobjectives:

57.      The release of each of the two tranches would be conditioned on: (i)  the maintenance of a stable
macro-economic framework, which will be monitored based on the performance indicators outlined in
the policy matrix (Annex 2); (ii)     progress on the implementation of reforms in each of the three
components of the program; and (iii)the following specific actions linked to each tranche and

      (viii)Macro performance indicators
      (ix) Formulation of a medium-term fiscal framework satisfactory to the Bank, envisaging a
            positive primary fiscal balance (excluding grants and privatization receipts) as of 2008, and
            presented to the Chamber of Deputies as part of the economic budget documentation for FY
            2006

58.      In addition to the indicators included in the macroeconomic framework of the program, the
impact of this programwill also be monitored through the following focused set of indicators:

    9 Levelofbankprovisioningas ashareofNPLs
    9 Numberandamountofnew lifeinsurancecontracts
    9 Jobcreationbyprivatesector, anddecomposition by levelofeducation
    9 Evolution ofinvestment by on-shoreandoffshore companies
    9 Evolution offoreigndirectinvestment


C.       POLICY AREAS

59.      The main policy areas of the proposed operation are macroeconomic stability and fiscal
consolidation, private sector development and financial sector development.


                              VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

A.       POVERTY AND SOCIALIMPACTS

60.      The Social Safeguardpolicy pertainingto Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) does not apply
to this project.

61.      The project's objectives to improve competitiveness will have a direct and positive impact on
growth and ultimately job creation. However, the opening up for more competition from imports could
lead to the decline of currently protected activities and lay-offs, which may hurt segments of the
population. However, the program intends to better prepare Tunisia's private sector to the impact of the
full roll-over of the AAEU, which will take place independently of ECDPL IV. This operation aims
precisely at mitigating some of this potential short-term negative impact by improving up-stream
Tunisia's competitiveness and attractivity.


B.       SUPERVISION

62.      The Ministry of Development and International Cooperation and will be the main entity
responsible for overall implementation of the proposed operation and for reporting progress and
coordinating actions among other concerned agencies (Central Bank, insurance regulator and capital
market authority). The World Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the implementation of
the proposed operation. At the same time, the overall status of the government's program will be
monitored during supervision to determine whether the specific conditions of the proposed operation
have changed. In addition, supervision missions will not only allow the Bank to continue the policy
dialogue with the institutions involved in the implementation of the program of reform, but also will
ensure the deployment of staff and consultants able to advise the government in all of the policy and
technical areas involved inthe reforms.

                                                   - 22 -


C.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

63.     The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), a core diagnostic undertaken by the
Bank, shows that the fiduciary framework of the Government of Tunisia (GOT) i s basically sound and
provides a strong control environment. The main findings of the CFAA are that the Tunisian public
financial management system is reliable and that the related fiduciary risk i s low. The complete budget
process (preparation, planning, and negotiation with line-ministers) is sound. The budget execution i s
also of good quality and reliable.

64.     The reporting and accounting are reliable, even though there i s a room for improvement and
modernization; the computerization of the budget and accounting i s rather simple, but well spread among
the public operators and its architecture allows a timely reporting. The cash and debt managements are
made in a professional way, due notably, to a strong technical assistanceof the Bank. The whole area of
control and audit i s comprehensive and reliable, but still lacking sufficient public disclosure, notably for
the annual report of the Cow des Comptes which i s only partially disclosed.


D.      DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

65.     The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
loanskredits. The approved tranches will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the
development policy programand not tied to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will
be needed.

66.     Once the loan i s approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the first tranche
will be deposited by IBRDin an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the World Bank
at the Central Bank of Tunisia at the request of the Borrower. The proceeds of the secondtranche will be
deposited after all the conditions of the secondtranche release are met. The Borrower should ensure that
upon the deposit of the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in the treasury current
account at the CentralBank.

67.     The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account
and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to promptly
upon notice refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to the
Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this loan will be the responsibility of
the Central Bank.


E.      ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

68.     Since this proposed project i s a Development Policy Lending (or DPL) it falls under the recently
approved OP/BP 8.6. Policies supported by the proposed adjustment loan are not likely to have any
significant direct effects on the environment and natural resources; safeguard policies (such as OP 4.01
Environmental Impact Assessment) do not apply to this operation, and an Integrated Safeguard Data
Sheet (ISDS) i s not needed. Although the proposed policies will probably have an overall positive impact
on the environment, some indirect impacts could arise but are expected to remain marginal.


F.      RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION

69.     (i) Unfavorable exogenous and/or endogenous shocks could hit the economy, with growth
slowing temporarily or persistently, depending on the duration of the shocks. Regional instability and

                                                   - 23 -


increased concerns of terrorism attacks could affect Tunisia in the coming years, with tourism failing to
reach the expected levels, and Tunisia losing some of its attractiveness for foreign investors. At the same
time, greater integration into global markets, in particular, the completion of the M U , will increase
exposure to volatility and put pressure on the current account, while the removal of the MFA quotas may
pose competitive threats and slow down growth. Such unfavorable developments would be reflected in
economic performance falling short of the projections underpinning the macroeconomic component of
the program. However, dramatic changes in the external environment are unlikely over the period of the
loan, and risks would be mitigated through close monitoring of the macroeconomic framework, in
cooperation with the IMF,and through quick adoption of appropriate corrective measuresif needed.

        (ii) Weakening drive for reform or slow pace of change. The economy's resilience would
partly depend on the quality of policy adjustment (as in 2002), and partly on the strength of the
investment climate and the soundness of the banking system. Yet, in light of economic and political
uncertainties, the Government may choose to slow down or hold back on important reforms in an effort
to maintain internal stability. A slowdown in the pace of reforms, inparticular a failure to strengthen the
investment climate as needed in the face of stiffer competition would create unsustainable external and
budgetimbalances, increasepublic and foreign debt, and leadto increasing unemployment andlower FDI
inflows.

        Risks to specific program components. The pace of reduction of the level of NPLs would
depend on improvements in the relationship between the banks and some key corporate borrowers, some
of which could have a vested interest to oppose such NPLreduction. Inaddition, the role of the judiciary
will be central inensuring the realization of guarantees and loan collateral; expected improvements could
not materialize as quickly and firmly as expected. As for the investment climate component, private
investors' reactions (both in the onshore and in the offshore sectors) to the progressive evolution of the
incentives framework will be key, including to comfort the Government's reformist stance (and hopefully
to induce an evenmore ambitious approach).

        (iii) Technical capacity constraints. Notwithstanding the overall highquality of Tunisian public
administration, some of the proposed areas of reforms (performance-based budgeting, debt management,
financial markets) could be delayed by capacity constraints.

70.     Riskmitigation measures:

  (0    Furtherstrengthening the macroeconomic framework will help Tunisia reduce its vulnerability to
        exogenous shocks. Strengthened fiscal consolidation will mitigate the external pressures on the
        current account over the medium term and help reduce public debt at a faster pace, thus boosting
        investor confidence and improving terms of foreign financing.

ANNEX 1:LETTER OFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


Unofficial Translation

REPUBLICOF TUNISIA


The President of the World Bank
1818 HStreet, NW
Washington, D C 20423


                                LETTEROF DEVELOPMENTPOLICY

Mr.President:

Tunisia's performance, particularly over the past fifteen years, i s the result of a choice made in the late
1980sto embark on a path leading to modernizationand openness. The structural reforms undertaken in
the wake of the 1986 crisis, which have been deepenedon a sustained basis, have paved the way for the
Tunisian economy to transition from a planned and protected economy to one that i s dynamic,
diversified, and open.       As a result of these reforms, along with rigorous management of the
macroeconomic framework and the social policies implemented, Tunisia has achieved rapid and
sustained growth during this period, in parallel with harmonious social progress. A number of these
reforms have been initiated as part of the various Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loans (ECALs)
supported by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the European Union, through a
structural adjustment facility, and that are now approaching a fourth phase (ECDPL IV),which serves as
a key mechanism for boostingthe competitiveness of the national economy.

Taking into account the commitments made during the transition to liberalization and an open market
economy, Tunisia firmly believes that the reform effort should be continued and deepened, in order to
address the host of challenges facing the economy and to safeguard the economic and social progress
made, while at the same time maintaining sound and stable macroeconomic equilibria.

The performance of the economy, particularly most recently, the main reforms undertaken, the challenges
to be faced, and the main thrusts of the ECDPL IV are discussedbelow.

Recent Economic and Social Developments in Tunisia

The reforms undertaken since 1986 have put the Tunisian economy back on a growth path, and through
its membership in the WTO, it has pursued its strategy of gradual openness to the global economy. This
process was subsequently reinforced by the Association Agreement, concluded in 1995, which should
lead to the establishment of a free trade zone with the European Union by 2008.

As a result of these reforms, Tunisia has posted impressive results duringthe period of the 9* Plan (1997-
2001), reflected in the following main indicators:

    -    An annual averageGDP growth rate of 5.3 percent, a figure higher than the 4.6 percent achieved
         under the previous Plan(1992-1996);

    -    Greater diversification of the productive base, with the share of manufacturing industries rising

                                                     -25 -


        to 21 percent of GDP in 2001 against 19.4 percent in 1996, and the contribution of services to
        national wealth increasing from 54.3 percent to 57 percent, respectively;

    -   An annual average 11 percent increase in overall investment, which pushed the rate of
        investment to 26.1 percent of GDP in 2001 against 23.2 percent in 1996, and the private sector
        share of investment from 53.4 percent in 1996 to 55.6 percent in 2001, reflecting the positive
        effect of the incentives extended to private investors;

    -   Improvement inthe business environment and basic infrastructure, which led to the attraction of
        more foreign direct investment, the volume of which more than doubled between 1996 (TD 306.8
        million) and 2001 (TD 718.3 million), and inturnto the creation of new enterprises andjobs;

    -   An increase in foreign trade; which in the case of exports, stood at an annual average of 7.4
        percent thanks to both the traditional and new sectors, and in the case of imports, at 7.3 percent,
        owing largely to the robust growth rate;

    -   A consolidation of national savings to 23.3 percent of national disposable incomein2001;

    -   The preservation of macroeconomic equilibria, through the containment of the current account
        deficit to an average of 3.5 percent of GDP, despite an unfavorable international environment; of
        the budget deficit, which dipped to under 3 percent of GDP compared to an average of 3.7
        percent during the previous Plan; of the debt ratio, which stabilized at 52.3 percent of gross
        national disposable income in 2001; of the debt service, which fell to 13.6 percent of current
        revenue in2001 against 17.6 percent in 1996; and of inflation;

    -   From a social standpoint, 322,000 jobs, covering 92 percent of additional demand, were created
        and per capita income rose from TD 2,090 to TD 2,966 between 1996 and 2001; the poverty rate
        fell to 4.2 percent compared to 6.2 percent in 1995; life expectancy improved; the infant
        mortality rate declined; and the rate of illiteracy fell. The significant increase inconnection rates
        to safe water and electricity inrural areas and the decline inthe proportion of rudimentary houses
        also reflect the improved living conditions of the population and equitable distribution of the
        benefits derived from growth.

All these achievements, in both the economic and social spheres, have strengthened Tunisia's position
and its ability to attract more foreign investment, as evidenced by the credit ratings Tunisia has received
from specialized international agencies and, in general terms, its global competitive position, which led
the Davos World Economic Forumto rank it first among African countries.

The Tenth Development Plan (2002-2006) i s underpinned by the continuation and consolidation of
economic reform efforts, centered around three main areas, namely: bolsteringthe competitiveness of the
economy, strengthening social progress achieved, and maintaining overall equilibrium and a stable and
sustainable macroeconomic framework. The development agenda adopted for the period covered by the
Tenth Plan provides for the attainment of an annual average growth rate on the order of 5.7 percent, in
line with a 4.8 percent increaseinper capita income, supported primarily by:

    -   A higher overallproductivity of inputs(44 percent against 36 percent during the previous Plan);

    -   A sustained increase in exports despite increasingly competitive conditions resulting, inter alia,
        from the presenceof new competitors inthe European market;
    -   Consolidation of private investment, the volume and efficiency of which should increase;

                                                   - 26 -

    -    Promotion of savings through the adoption of appropriate measures aimed at containing the
         budget deficit with a view to enhancing fiscal balance and the ability of the economy to
         withstand unexpected exogenous shocks.

This Plan started under difficult conditions, in view of the continuation of the drought in 2002 for the
fourth consecutive year, adverse international events that have led to a slowdown in global economic
growth, and a contraction in trade, tourism, and capital flows. The tourism, air transport, insurance, and
foreign investment sectors were the hardest hit by this difficult environment.

Despite these factors of instability, the Tunisian economy achieved positive growth, and internal and
external financial balance was preserved through the measures and policies implemented to contain the
negative effects of economic conditions. As a result, Tunisia's standing with international financial
institutions and specialized agenciesremained intact.

This performance was strengthened in 2003 and 2004 by improved climatic conditions and the recovery
of the global economy. As a result, along with the preservation of macroeconomic balance, a growth rate
of 5.8 percent was posted in 2004, despite the surge in the prices of raw materials and oil on global
markets, pressure exerted on public finance in particular, and inflation. Savings continued to trend
upwards, climbing to 22.4 percent of disposable income in 2004, against 21.9 percent in 2002.
Investment increased by 6.5 percent in 2004, after its relatively weak performance in recent years -
virtual stagnation in 2002 (0.9 percent) and a decline in 2003 (-1percent), which ledto a drop inits share
of GDP in 2004 to 22.9 percent, compared to 23.4 percent in 2003 and 25.4 percent in 2002.
International trade returned to satisfactory levels, thereby facilitating higher cover rates of 73.7 and 76
percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Incombinationwith the increased revenue generatedby tourism,
this improvement in international trade held the current account deficit at 2 percent of GDP in 2004,
compared to 3 percent the previous year.

All in all, the performance of the different sectors was affected by the international environment and
domestic conditions. However, it must be stressed that the reforms implemented over the past two
decades have fostered conditions conducive to progress, as a result of a more enabling business climate
and the continuing efforts of the Government to develop human resources through training and to
improve basic infrastructure: ports, airports, the road and highway network, the telecommunications
network, the electrical grid, and the supply of safe water.

The Tunisian economy is currently evolving and will continue to do so, in a later phase, in an
environment characterized by more rapid globalization and the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean
common space. This environment, into which Tunisia has opted to integrate, presents challenges that
must be faced as well as opportunities that must be seized. Tunisia's capacity to do so is contingent on
its adaptability and on opportunities to enhance its competitiveness, taking into account in particular the
dismantling of tariffs underway, agreedto under the Partnership Agreement concludedwith the European
Union, which is entering a crucial phase for Tunisian enterprises, as well as the expansion of the EUto
25 members and the phase-out of the MultifiberAgreement.

Moreover, free trade, which thus far has been limited to goods, will be expanded to include services. In
this regard, negotiations are underway within the WTO and should soon start with the EUand the Arab
Free Trade Zone. In addition, the phase-out of the Multifiber Agreement runs the risk of creating
hardship for a large segment of the industrial base, while the new neighborhood policy could give
impetus to the reforms already underway.

The Tunisian Economy Future Trendsand Constraints
                          -

The presidential program "Tunisia of Tomorrow" outlined the objectives of and trends in the Tunisian
economy for the 2005 to 2009 period.          This program opens up new possibilities for Tunisia by
identifying, in 21 points, future trends and objectives to be achieved during the upcomingphase that will
prepare Tunisia for tomorrow.

Drawing support from all segments of Tunisian society, this program i s an affirmation of the resolve to
forge ahead with reforms in order to ensure the sustainability of economic growth and social progress. It
places employment at the helmof nationalpriorities, bearing inmindthe constantpressureexerted on the
labor market and the increase inthe percentageof university graduates among the mainjob seekers.

The main thrusts of this program, implementation of which started early this year, focuses on several
areas that will pave the way for a more effective positioning of the national economy. The key areas,
which are economic in nature, pertain to employment, which tops the list of priorities, the need to
provide a solid foundation for building a knowledge-based economy, more rapid creation of enterprises
and projects, boosting exports, achieving a higher economic growth plane through a greater level of
integration into the international environment, modernization of the banking and financial system, a
move that would transform the region into a hub for development, and improving living conditions
mainly through higher incomes and greater consumer protection.

Building on the progress achieved, Tunisia has decided to continue on a path to development while
taking into account the current and future constraints of the next phase, in particular, the top position
accorded to employment on the list of priorities. The preservation of this progress and the sustainability
of development work remain, however, contingent on the degree of execution of these reforms, taking
into account the plethora of constraints that the economy will face in 2005 and beyond, many of which
will be imposed on Tunisia by the changing international environment, especially since a number of
commitments will fall due early this year, inparticular the phase-out of the Multifiber Agreement.

Tunisia will therefore face a host of constraints and challenges, the biggest being strengthening the
foundation for growth that is sufficiently sustainable to attain the objectives related to employment in
particular, through the achievement, on an ongoing basis, of a growth rate on the order of 6 percent at a
minimum, quickening the pace of structural reforms, fostering an enabling business climate and
restructuringthe financial system inorder to provide further impetus to the country's economic activity.

Job creation

The first of these constraints, however, continues to be employment, which has always been among the
priorities of the development effort. The unemployment rate, estimated at 13.9 percent in 2004, i s
considered relatively high despite the fact that it i s trending downward, but the structure of the
unemployed labor force i s changing and now includes graduates from higher education. Owing to a
number of demographic factors, including increased female participation inthe labor market, the opening
up of the economy continues as does the increased competition resultingfrom this opening; labor market
pressures will continue to place a burden on the development effort, making it necessary to achieve a
faster pace of wealth accumulation on a sustainable basis inorder to address these pressures and attend to
a steadily mountingdemand for jobs.

Promotion of private investment

The employment challenge i s also tributary of greater private sector participation in the investment effort,
which is still regardedas insufficient and falling short of the objectives of the Tenth Plan, as the share of

                                                  - 28 -


private investment in total investment will have to increase further in order to reach the objective of 58.5
percent by the end of the current Plan (2006) and 60 percent by 2009 as set by the "Tunisia of
Tomorrow" Program.

A number of factors come together to explain this shortage of private investment, including: the
extension of the Enterprise Upgrading Program (programme de mise u niveau) for major enterprises to
cover medium-sized and small enterprises, which necessarily reduces the overall volume of investment;
the structure of the economy, which has further diversified into services, areas of activity which do not
require sizable investments; the major privatization operations; and the reduction in investment in the
agricultural sector duringa period of drought.

Heightened competition

The reforms introduced over the past 20 years have enhanced the competitiveness of the Tunisian
economy and consolidated its position, in particular following the Association Agreement with the
European Union and Tunisia's entry into the WTO.           Even greater insertion into the international
economy i s foreseen with the liberalization of certain activities in the agricultural and services sectors,
meaning that the Tunisian economy will be called upon to evolve in an ever more competitive
environment.

This new context has created additional constraints that Tunisia will have to address in the years ahead,
among which i s the MFA elimination and all that this implies, especially for the textile sector, as regards
both production and exports. At the same time, these new rules of the game will have an impact on the
labor market and the unemployment rate.

Policies and reforms for achieving these Objectives

Tunisia's development objectives for the years ahead are embodied in the PresidentialProgram "Tunisia
of Tomorrow," which has identified the reforms to be pursued and the policies to be adopted with a view
to achieving the objectives set inresponseto the challenges of a globalizedeconomy.

Inthis context, the aimis to strengthenthe partnership with the EuropeanUnion, consolidate cooperation
with Arab and African countries at the bilateral, multilateral, and tripartite levels, and promote the
prospectsfor cooperation with the countries of the Americas and Asia.

This greater opening to the outside, which is both necessary and replete with challenges, appears to be
the only path toward progress and prosperity. It demands a strengthening of market mechanisms, the
promotion of private initiative, and consolidation of the competitiveness of the economy, while
continuing to build a free and pluralistic society by strengthening the institutions of government and
enhancing the role of civil society so as to guarantee that all citizens participate in the development
effort.

Improving the competitiveness of the economy depends upon three pillars:

         Continuingthe modernizationand consolidation of the banking and financial system; and
        Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework that can ensure sustainable development.

To spur private investment, both Tunisian and foreign, the Tunisian authorities propose to continue the
reform of the administration to adapt it to the new economy and to improve administrative services to
enterprises, both by eliminating authorizations and replacing'them by codes of duties, and by mandating

                                                    - 29 -


shorter responsetimes to requests submitted to the Administration.

Improving the transport and communications infrastructure, reducing the cost of public services, creating
new industrial zones and business centers, strengthening support structures, and encouraging innovation
and scientific and technological research-to     which end 1.25 percent of GDP will be devoted by 2009-
are also part of the action programenvisagedwith a view to spurring private investment.

The Tunisian authorities are convinced that development no longer depends solely on capital
accumulation, and now depends more and more on the mastery of technology and the skills of workers
and entrepreneurs, together with their capacity to adapt to change, act in innovative and creative ways,
and demonstrate initiative. Consequently the authorities will continue their efforts to builda knowledge-
based economy by enhancing the flexibility of the educational system through the diversification of
curricula and specialties, and by ensuring greater complementarily with vocational training, scientific
research, and production. Inthis context, it i s planned to support public efforts inthis regardnot only by
strengthening the research centers associated in particular with promising and leading edge sectors as
part of the policy to create technological hubs and enterprise nurseries, but also by gradually establishing
a partnership betweenthe researchinstitutions and the private sector.

At the same time, the Government will continue its policy of withdrawing from the productive and
commercially profitable sectors in order to concentrate its efforts on establishing, first, a modem
infrastructure base and an appropriate training system and, second, a legal and institutional framework
conducive to the proper functioning of the rules of the market as well as the elimination of obstacles to
Tunisian and foreign private investment. In addition, the Tunisian authorities plan to promote private
investment in the social sectors such as education, higher education, vocational training, or health, as
well as municipal public services. What i s more, there are plans to offer additional infrastructure
projects to the private sector under concessionor license arrangements.

The modernization of the Tunisian banking system and its reorganization, as well as the consolidation of
its financial base, will receive special attention so that the system i s able to mobilize additional domestic
and external resources for use in financing investments. Strengthening the financial market to make it
possible to channel greater amounts of private investment toward the productive sectors will constitute an
important focus of government efforts in the years ahead. These are necessary steps in order to make
progress toward fully convertibility of the dinar. Progress inthese areas will help make Tunisia a global
center for trade and services.
Finally, to preserve macroeconomic balances, the Tunisian authorities will endeavor to curb inflation to a
maximum of 3 percent and to limit the current deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2009, while continuing to
reduce the debt ratio and to implement tight fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. Such measures
are essential in order to enhance Tunisia's credibility on international financial markets and attract a
greater volume of foreign investment.

Theaction program ahead

Building on the progress it has made, Tunisia i s now embarking on a critical phase in its economic and
social development, marked by far-reaching changes both nationally and internationally and by the
aspirations and demandscharacterizing the next development stage.

Insodoing, itwill continue itseffortsto intensifyandfurther acceleratethe structuralreforms inrelevant
areas such as the financial sector and the investment climate, endeavoring to make the objectives it has
set a reality and, in the process, move to a higher growth plane in which the Tunisian economy's
integration into the global sphere i s consolidated and its capacity to address ever stiffer competition i s
enhanced.

Building upon the programs implemented to improve the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy,
ECDPL IV, the continuation of the three earlier components, will support the Government's efforts inthe
following areas:

    -
    -    Spurring private investment;
         Strengthening the financial sector; and
    -   Maintaininga stable and responsive macroeconomic framework.

Spurringprivateinvestment

Increased interest has been shown in private investment in recent years, as reflected in the various
measures enacted principally to improve the business climate, build up investment in regional
development, support small and medium-sized enterprises, and facilitate business creation and
investment in promising sectors while strengthening the upgrading program (programme de mise h
niveau), as well as the various programs relating to human resource promotion, improving performance
in the Administration, modernizing the banking and financial sector, consolidating infrastructure,
establishing technologicalhubs, and continuing the privatization program.
The aimis to increase the share of private investment intotal investment to 58.5 percent by the end of the
Tenth Plan. This aim i s expected to address the need for diversifying the national production base and
meeting the challenges of competition, exports, and especially employment, which now has the highest
priority.

To this end, as part of this program, the Government plans to carry out the following:

    -    Actively continue efforts to reduce the number of activities requiringprior authorization, either
        by eliminating such authorizations or by replacing same by codes of duties. This effort will
         make it possible further to simplify administrative procedures and spur private initiative. It i s
         important to stress at this juncture that, first, an initial program aimed at reducing prior
         authorizations has been carried out and covered 60 percent of the activities calling for such
         authorization, and, second, that the "Tunisia of Tomorrow" programtargets continuing this effort
         in order to boost this proportion to 90 percent by 2009. The measures to be included under
        ECDPLIV are aimed at reducingthe number of activities subject to prior authorizations to fewer

    -    than 120 by end-2006;
        Facilitate business creation and operation by lowering the regulatory requirement of minimum
         capital neededto createnew firms, whatever their legal form;

    -   Improve the mechanism for immediate reimbursement and refund of proven credits against the
        value-added tax in order to ease the tax burden on enterprises with audited accounts while
         guaranteeing adequate collections of tax revenue in light of the progress being made with the
        program to dismantle customs tariffs and the need to protect the sustainability of fiscal balance.
        The rate of the "immediate reimbursement" of the VAT, currently set at 15 percent, will be
        raisedto 35 percent for those enterprises with certified accounts;

    -    Strengthen competition policy through a revision of the legal and institutional framework for
         competition, aimed largely at consolidating the administrative and financial autonomy of the
         Competition Council; and

    -   Improve the tax environment for companies by conducting a study focused on evaluating the
        reforms already implemented and on identifying future approaches to take in light of anticipated
        developments, in particular the effective introduction,of the free trade area with the European
        Union.

                                                   - 31 -


Strengthening the financial sector

The reform strategy being implemented for the financial sector is aimed at meeting the financing
requirements of the economy as best as possible, enhancing the efficiency of financial institutions, and
continuing to external financial liberalization.
These reforms have focused in particular on modemizing and reorganizing the banking sector to
consolidate the financial base of the banks, on enhancing the efficiency of intermediation operations and
buildingthe related institutional and organizational capacities, and on improving the quality of services
offered and the mobilization of sufficient resourceswhile ensuring optimum resource allocation.

In addition, major reforms have been brought to the financial market as regards the role it plays in
tapping savings and channeling themtoward the productive sectors.

Efforts will continue with a view to deepening and advancing further with these reforms. The major
actions to be taken under this program will be focused principally on:

    -   Continuing and speeding up the process of rehabilitating banks' portfolios of classified claims
        and improving the terms for recovering claims while ensuring that bad debts are not accumulated
        inthe future. It is important to recall, at this level, that inrecent years, substantial efforts have
        been made as regards the capitalization and provisioning of banks, improving recovery, and
        enhancing the flexibility with which loss provisions are treated and the conditions under which
        classified claims may be written off bank balance sheets. These efforts have been accompanied
        by operations aimed at cleaning up banks' classified claims by the Government assuming
        responsibility for the claims on public and quasipublic enterprises;

    -   Strengthening the transparency rules for companies listed on the stock market by promulgating
        the law on financial security; and

    -   Conducting a study on asset recovery companies and the quality of the provisions for impaired
        claims, with a view to making appropriate recommendations and identifying actions to be taken.

 The insurance sector has received close scrutiny since the early 199Os, and has benefited from far-
reaching reforms aimed at reorganizing and modernizing the sector. The actions taken have included
development of the legal and institutional framework, improving the major insurance arrangements, and
starting a program for upgrading insurance companies. These actions should contribute to increasing
insurance companies' earnings, bettering the quality of the services rendered, and improving the
technical and financial performance of the sector ingeneral.

These efforts will be intensified during the period ahead in order to enhance the competitiveness of the
sector and prepare it to face foreign competition. The major actions covered by ECDPL IV relate in
particular to:

    -    Improving the oversight bodies by reorganizing the General Committee on Insurance so as to
        make it autonomous;

    -    Continuing the restructuring of some insurance companies by adopting and carrying out
        restructuring plans for the companies concerned;

    -   Rehabilitatingthe auto insurance sector by continuing to develop the associatedlegislative and
        regulatory framework and raising auto insurance premia; and

                                                   - 3 2 -


    -   Eliminating the requirement for prior authorization by the HighCommissionon Investment for
        majority participation by foreign investors.

Maintaininga stable and responsivemacroeconomicframework

One of Tunisia's major concerns has been maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework despite the
changes and disruptions that have continually affected the national and international environment.

Inthis regard, the macroeconomic approach has been focused on the pursuit of rapid growth, making it
possible to achieve investment and job creation goals while preserving domestic and external financial
balances.

Inthiscontext themajoraimsincludedinECDPLIVinclude:
    -   Maintaining the macroeconomic and fiscal framework;

    -   Assessingmacroeconomic performance on the basis of appropriate indicators identified in
        advance;

    -   Strengthening fiscal managementby formulating a medium-termframework; and

    -   Improving external debt management by more carefully defining external debt management and
        makingbetter use of the financing instruments available internationally.

All of these aims bear witness to Tunisia's determination to continue to strengthen the reformprocess,
especially as regardsthe financial and insurance sector, the business climate, and the upgradingprogram.
Actions will also be taken with a view to enhancing the dynamism of private investment by boosting the
productivity of production factors and enhancing the competitiveness of Tunisian output.

Macroeconomic framework

The macroeconomic framework of the years ahead will be characterized by the gradual implementation
of the policies and objectives set forth inthe presidentialprogram"Tunisia of Tomorrow," which defined
the basic directions of future development efforts, delineated Tunisia's economic and social development
prospects for 2005-2009, and established specific objectives. Inaddition, the programlaid out a cohesive
approach toward meeting these objectives throughout the period covered.
This macroeconomic framework i s laid out ina context characterized by changes which are at the root of
new challenges arising from the strategic choice to become gradually more integrated in the global
economy. The Tunisian economy will have to meet these challenges inthe years ahead, makingthe most
of opportunities which can be used to advantage, dealing with new constraints that require additional
efforts, and engaging in an ongoing reform process affecting the various core mechanisms of the
economy.

The challenges for the Tunisian economy include: the phase-out of the Multifiber Agreements and the
impact this is expected to have, in particular on the performance of the textile sector confronted by ever
harsher competition owing to the admission of new competitor countries into the European Union, our
principal market; the possible repercussions of expanding the EU to include ten new countries from
Central and Eastern Europe which constitute as many potential competitors; and the continuing opening
toward the EUin the context of the Association Agreement signed with this partner, which calls in short
order for the end of the transition period, leading in 2008 to the creation of a free trade area with the EU
for industrial products.

                                                    - 3 3 -


The international context for the years ahead also entails a number of difficulties which could arise from:

    -    The strong likelihood that the prices of crude oil, petroleum products, and certain other
         commodities will remain high and give rise, as they did in 2004, to strong pressures both on the
         government budget and on inflation and shrinkingpurchasing power;

    -    The increased opening of the economy to the outside, with what this implies as regards the
         increased penetration of the domestic market by foreign products and the more intense
         competition resulting from this in view of the commitments made, given that negotiations with
         the WTO and EU will commence in 2005 with a view to the future liberalization of certain
         activities inrespect of services and agriculture; and

    -    The possible downturn in domestic economic conditions, principally owing to climatic
         conditions and their unfavorable impact on the agricultural sector and, as a result, on overall
         growth.

All these events constitute decisive moments for Tunisia, which will have to adequately prepare its
economy to cope with the new constraints arising from them inthe years ahead.

Inconsequence, the orientations embodied inthe macroeconomic framework are part of a global vision
based, on the one hand, on the continuation of the reforms already initiated, inparticular under the three
earlier components of the ECDPL (ECAL I-III) on the other hand, on the identification and
                                                       and,
implementation of other reforms which take account of the economic outlook as described in the
presidential programcovering 2005-2009.
Effectively meeting the objectives set out will require, for the period ahead, achieving increased wealth
accumulation rates so as to fulfill national aspirations as regards jobs. This objective, once again boosted
to the level of top priority inthe development effort, absolutely must be accompanied by the preservation
of the domestic and external macroeconomic and financial balance.

Accordingly, efforts will be made to enhance the dynamism of private investment by continuing the
reforms initiated with a view to further spurring investment by the private sector. The aim is to further
improve the business climate and the general environment in which companies operate and to facilitate
and intensify the pace at which businesses are created, this inpursuit of the objective of creating 70,000
enterprises and projects as stipulated by the presidential programfor the next five years.

The measures planned to this end are likely to generate opportunities for the private sector through the
simplification of administrative procedures, this by continuing the program to reduce the number of
activities subject to prior authorization requirements-which        will be replaced by codes of duties or
eliminated-and     by further opening up investment to Tunisian nationals and foreigners. Such measures
are likely to help meet the objective for 2009 laid out in the presidential program, namely to reduce the
number of activities subject to administrative authorizations, eliminating them for 90 percent of activities
in2009 as against the 60 percent achieved to date.

The resurgence in economic activity recorded since mid-2003, after the various disruptions that had
characterized the international environment and significantly affected the performance of the Tunisian
economy, has led to satisfactory outcomes in particular as regards growth, jobs, and the preservation of
domestic and external financial balances. Future efforts will focus in particular on new market niches
and innovative sectors with high value-added, such as information and communications technologies,
which are drivers of economic growth owing to their strong contribution to increasing gross domestic
product, loweringthe unemployment rate, and enhancing overall competitiveness.

                                                   - 34 -


Efforts will also be intensified with a view to, first, further promoting exports through more targeted
guidance for exporters and increased diversification of the production system and, second, boosting
national savings, in particular long-term savings, by continuing the effort to modernize the banking
sector, enhancethe dynamism of the financial market, and reform the insurance sector.

Other areas in which additional efforts will be made are: the pursuit of a fiscal policy which targets
improving the level of domestic revenue, in particular tax revenue, and controlling public expenditure,
especially operating expenditure, while continuing the focus on increasing the outlays on infrastructure
modernization and human resource development, especially those devoted to scientific research,
education and higher education, vocational training, and health.

The primary objectives set are aimed at:

     -   Continuing to achieve relatively high levels of GDP growth, with the objective of gradually
         reaching the higher levels that will create more jobs, respond to increased demand, and reduce
         the unemployment rate, which currently stands at 13.9 percent;

     -   Reducingthe current account deficit of the balance of payments from 3.6 percent of GDP in2002
         to 3 percent in 2007, inkeeping with the objective set forth inthe presidentialprogramto bring it
         down to 2.5 percent by 2009;

     -   Maintaining foreign exchange reserves at a level sufficient to cover 3.5 months of imports on
         average;

     -   Limitingthe budget deficit to lessthan 3 percent of GDPby 2007;

     -   Boosting the savings rate in the years ahead to a level compatible with the objective set forth in
         the presidential program (a rate of 25 percent by 2009), through a substantial increase in the
         contribution to savings mobilization made by the financial market; and

     -   Achieving higher per capita income, moving gradually toward the objective set forth in the
         presidentialprogram, namely TD 5,000 in2009 as compared to about TD 3,500 in 2004.

The reforms to be implemented are also focused on improving the debt indicators, with the objective of
lowering the debt ratio to 45 percent of gross national disposable income by end-2009 as compared to the
current level of about 49 percent. Successfully meeting this objective makes it all the more necessary to
introduce a dynamic debt management system that will permit the proper formulation of debt strategies
and policies and reduce borrowing costs through the more rational use of the new mechanisms offered by
the international financial market.

Notwithstanding the solid economic performance of recent years, and in light of recent international
developments and the constraints resulting from existing commitments and the global situation, Tunisia
i s resolved to continue and strengthen the reformprocesses initiated in various areas, particularly in the
financial sector and the business environment. Tunisia i s also cognizant of the fact that achieving the
objectives set for the years ahead will require, in addition to the national effort, more intensive
cooperation with its partners in order to bring that cooperation to a level consistent with the issues at
stake as well as the constraints of the stage ahead.

In the event of any significant deviations, the Government intends to initiate consultations with donors
and lenders and with the IMF in order to take stock of macroeconomic performance on the basis of a
periodically updated set of indicators, so as to incorporate the changes that have occurred and ensure the

                                                  -35 -


sustainability of the overall balances.

Achievement of all the objectives set forth in this Letter of Development Policy requires, in addition to
the national effort, increased support from our partners through the diversification and intensification of
international cooperation. For all these reasons, and in view of the importance of ECDPL IV for the
Tunisian economy and its future growth, the Tunisian Government requests the support of the World
Bank, the African Development Bank, and the European Union in the form of a structural adjustment
facility for financing this program, the implementation of which will consolidate the progress already
made under the program's three earlier components.

                Principal Assumptionsof the ECDPLI V Macroeconomic Framework


The macroeconomic framework envisagedfor ECDPL IV covering 2005-2007 reflects the objectives set
forth for the forthcoming period, namely higher GDP growth, greater diversification of the productive
base, an increased investment effort accompanied by a larger private sector contribution, increasedjob
creation which should lead to a reduction in the unemployment rate, a faster pace of export growth, and
the consolidation of national savings, all within a framework which ensures the preservation of
macroeconomic balances.

Inaddition, this framework takes account of the constraints relatingprimarily to:

    -   The international economic environment, which will be characterized above all by the
        competitive pressures that will have to be addressed invarious sectors, such as the textile sector
        owing to the phase-out of the Multifiber Agreements and the arrival of new competitor countries,
        as well as the gradual establishment of the free-trade area with the European Union;

    -   The economic policy measures that will be taken with a view to enhancing the competitiveness
        of the economy inthe years ahead; and

    -   The measures to strengthen the budgetary framework so as to continue the fiscal consolidation
        effort and speed the pace of reducingthe public debt.

ECDPL IV will help achieve the objectives established and will enable the Tunisian economy not only to
address the various constraints, but also to implement the reforms envisaged in various areas, in
particular enhancing the dynamismof the private sector and rehabilitatingthe financial sector.

The scenario adopted for the macroeconomic framework for 2005-2007 i s based on the following
principal assumptions:

    -   GDP growth of 5 percent for 2005, with a trend toward a higher pace in subsequent years with
        the objective of reaching 6 percent by 2007;

    -   An internationalenvironment that allows for increasing exports despite the constraints affecting
        certain sectors:

    -   An increase in investment, relating in particular to the measures planned under the ECDPL IV
        program, which are expected to spur private investment duringthe period under review thanks to,
        among other things, the easing of administrative formalities;

    -   Greater fiscal consolidationwith a view to offsetting the pressures on government finance; and

    -   The achievement of balanced budgets and, in general, the preservation of the macroeconomic
        equilibria.

 Over the past decade, Tunisia's economic performance has been one of the strongest in the region,
reflecting gradual but continuous structural reforms, well targeted social policies, and prudent
macroeconomic policies. Tunisia signed an AssociationAgreement with the EU (AAEU) in 1995, marking
the beginning of a significantopeningto trade with the EU. Fiscal and monetary discipline has contributed
to macroeconomic stability, in the context of a real effective exchange rate (REER) targeting framework
with controls on capitalflows.

The strength of the Tunisian economy continued in 2003 and the short-term outlook is favorable.
Favorable agriculture production and robust nonenergy exports contributed to high growth and a
narrowing of the external current account deficit in 2003. A rebound in tourism, a pick up in European
demand, and continued real depreciation of the dinar is projected to sustain this strength in 2004.
Monetary policy remains prudent and inflation under control. Greater exchange rate flexibility and the
appreciation of the euro vis-a-vis the US dollar have led to a depreciation of the dinar in real effective
terms. This flexibility has improvedTunisia's competitivenessand helpedstrengthen its external position.
On the fiscal front, a low tax buoyancy did not permit further consolidation in 2003, despite the recovery in
economic activity. The central government deficit remained at 3.5 percent of GDP in 2003 (excluding
grants and privatization receipts), about 0.8 percentage points higher than the budget target.
Nevertheless, this allowed for a reduction in the public debt by 0.7 percentage points of GDP, to
61 percent. The 2004 budget deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP is within reach thanks to measures on
the VAT and on subsidies expenditures and higher-than-expected profit transfers from state-owned
enterprises.

Bankingsector indicatorsdeterioratedfurther in 2003, in part due to difficult economic conditions in certain
sectors such as tourism, as well as competitive pressures, which Tunisia is facing in the context of

 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff
team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the October 27, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

growing openness. NPLs as a share of bank assets increased by three percentage points to 24 percent
in 2003. While these weaknesses do not pose systemic risks in the near term, current lending practices
dampen Tunisia's growth potential by increasingthe cost of capital.

Despite Tunisia's favorable economic performance, its objective of approaching lower-tier OECD income
levels has not been met and unemployment remains high. Meeting this challenge will require
strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework and accelerating structural change. Regarding the
former, the authorities are preparing to gradually open up the external capital account. To maintain a
measure of monetary policy independence, the authorities have begun a gradual transition toward a
floating exchange rate regime. They are also in the process of developing a new monetary policy
framework, which should be implementedshortly.

On the structural side, the authorities are implementing reform supported by the World Bank, the African
Development Bank, and the EU, under the Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan. Aside from
banking sector weaknesses, impediments include a still restrictivetrade regime (especiallyvis-a-vis non-
EU countries), labor market rigidities, and a business climate not yet fully conducive to private sector
dynamism. On trade, measures were taken in 2004 to lower and simplify MFN tariffs and streamline
customs procedures.

Tunisia continues to improve the quality and dissemination of statistical data and increase the
transparency of its economic policies. Tunisia has published all Executive Board documents and staff
mission statements in recent years and intend to publish the 2004 Article IV Staff Report and Selected
Issues papers.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Tunisian authorities for the success in maintaining the economy's
resilience and strength, notwithstanding recent shocks and sluggish growth in Europe-Tunisia's main
export market. Directorsnotedthat forward-looking and outward-orientedstructural policies, in conjunction
with prudent macroeconomicmanagement and well-targetedsocial policies, have put Tunisia among the
leaders in the region in terms of growth and market-oriented reforms. They praised the authorities for
maintainingclose and productivedialogue with the Fund.
Directors noted that, while the economic outlook for 2005 remains favorable-underpinned by a rebound
in tourism, agriculture, and exports-the main challenge for Tunisia is to solidify conditions for strong,
sustainable growth to attain lower-tier OECD income levels and reduce unemployment. They therefore
encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the current environment to accelerate reforms aimed at
raising the economy's potential and creating a business environment conducive to private investment.
Appropriate sequencing of these reforms while maintainingsocial cohesion will be key to the success of
such efforts.

Directors welcomed the fact that the mix of monetary policy and gradual increase in exchange rate
flexibility has helped improve external competitiveness and strengthen the external position. They agreed
that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate, but encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant
against price pressures as the economy expands, in order to safeguard the competitive gains that have
been achievedthus far.

Directors endorsed the authorities' phased approach to liberalizing capital flows and plan to eventually
float the dinar. They underlinedthe need to lay the groundwork for such a transition by strengthening the
banking sector, reducing public debt, and deepening the development of money and foreign exchange
markets. Directors welcomed the recent steps to increase the role of market forces in determining the
exchange rate-including     the decisions to reduce the surrender requirement and to eliminate the
requirement for banks to transfer foreign exchange balances to the central bank on a daily basis, the
"nivellement"-and encouraged the authorities to discontinue posting bid/ask spreads for the exchange
rate. They noted the considerable progress that has been made in developing a monetary framework
aimed at pricestability, which is a prerequisite for a floating exchange rate.

Directors expressed concern that banking sector weaknesses, especially the high level of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) could potentially constitute a major vulnerability.They welcomed the steps taken recentlyto

                                                       - 63 -


strengthen supervision and accounting standards, reduce NPLs, and increase provisioning. However,
Directors noted that additional measures are needed and urged the authorities to adopt stricter
provisioning rules, enforce sanctions against bankswith insufficient provisioningor capital, and reduce the
government's role in the financial sector. They also encouraged the authorities to broaden the banking
sector reform agenda in line with the FSAP recommendations.In this connection, Directorswelcomed the
authorities' intention to request an update to the 2002 FSAP. They underscored the importance of
consolidating the banking sector before any substantial progress is made toward an exchange rate float
and capital account liberalization.

Directors commended the authorities' efforts to contain the negative impact of high oil prices on the 2004
budget and supported their intention to carry out a broad reform of the tax system, with technical
assistance from the Fund. They stressed the needto adopt a budget for 2005 consistentwith the objective
of reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio, especially external debt, over the medium term. This, together
with prudent debt management, will help strengthen confidence in the currency. Directors urged the
authorities to redouble their revenue-enhancing efforts, through improving tax collection and
administration, phasing out tax exemptions, and widening the tax base. They also encouraged the
authorities to undertake a reform of the subsidies system and to consider a broad-based civil service
reform to enhance the efficiency of the public administration and contain the wage bill, while protecting
allocations for health and education. In this regard, the planned introduction of a performance-based
budgetingsystem should help guide budget decisions.

Directors commended the authorities' structural reform efforts and noted that emphasis should remain on
enhancing the business climate, attracting foreign direct investment, and improving the regulatory
framework. They welcomed, in particular, the progress in integrating trade with the European Union and
the continued efforts to enhance regional integration within the Maghreb region. Directors nevertheless
highlighted the benefits of accelerating trade liberalization on a multilateral basis, in terms of improved
productivity and greater trade opportunities. To this end, they encouraged the authorities to continue
lowering most-favored-nationtariffs within the 2005 budget law, and to reduce nontariff barriers, including
by pursuing further reforms in customs administration, and liberalizing the distribution and transportation
sectors. Directorswelcomed the decisionto study options for dismantling state import monopolies.

Directors notedthat the recent measures to enhance labor market flexibility are importantsteps to reduce
unemployment and support labor reallocation in response to changes in the economic structure. They
encouragedthe authoritiesto streamline labor regulations,continue to pursue active labor market policies,
and explore further ways to enhance labor market flexibility, with a view to ensuring that growth translates
into reduced unemployment.

Directors commended the authorities' record of transparency. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to
improve the quality and dissemination of statisticswithin the framework of the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), as well as the intentionto updatethe 1999 data ROSC.

Directors welcomed the recent creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and the adoption of a law on anti-
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AMUCFT). They looked forward to the full
implementationof the law, which is expected to contribute to a significant improvement in the country's
AMUCFT regime.


   Public information Notices (PINS)form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF'sviews and
   analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PlNs
   are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance
   of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member
  countries with longer-term program engagements. PlNs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
   general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
