REPORT AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE   CECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO SIDERURGICA LAZARO CARDENAS
- LAS TRUCHAS, S.A. AND NACIONAL FINANCIERA., S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A STEEL PROJECT
10          I submit the following report and recommandat±ons on a
proposed loan in various currencies equivalent to $70 million jointly
to Siderir:gica La.zaro Cardenas - Las Truchas, S.A. (SICARTSA) and
Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFIh) to assist in finarLcing a new steel
plant at Lazaro Cardenas* The loan would be guaranteed by United
Mexican States and would have a term of 15 years, including five years
of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum, The Mexican
Government would charge SICAdRSA a gnarantee fee of 1-3/4 percent, per
annum on the ou1tstanding amount of the Bank loan, br-nging the cost of
the loan to SICARTSA to 9 percent per annum, The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) will participate in the financing of the project
with a loanx for $514 million and bil&teral financing xill amount rvo about
$180 million.,
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.          My report and recommendation dated Mayr 30, 1973 on tihe Mexico
City Water Supply Project (P-1207a-ME), gave recent information on the
Mexican economy. This is reproduced and updated in Annex I, following the
country data. The Basic Economic Report (192-KE) of June 27, t973 was the
subject of a Board Seminar on July 26, 1973. The Report concludes that
Mexico continues to be creditworthy for substantial amounts of Bank loans.
The ratio of debt service payments to receipts from exports of goods and
non-factor services, which was estimated at less than 20 percent in 1972
is expected to peak in the late 1970's at near 25 percent and should
decline thereafter. During the next few years Mexico's annual gross ex-
ternal borrowing requirements are estimated at about $1,400 million, of
which, as in the past, about 75 percent is lik-ely to be raised from
private sources. The IBRD's share in total annual debt service obligatiorns
is expected to remain near 10 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
3.          The Bank Group operations in Mexico were also recently reviewed
in the aforementioned Mexico City Water Supply Project report, and an up-
dated statement as of July 31, 1973 is presented in Annex TI.

a0          In lending to Miexico, the Bank tries to assist the
Goverrunent irn ach.ieving four major interdependert and complementary
objectives:
a)    to spread the benefits of growth more widely than before;
b)    to hielp Mexico continue to achieve the re-markable gromath
oL output of the past two decades;
c)    to help Mexico mobilize exuternal reEources to com=leaent
. GS cuite a-,preciable domestic savings; and
d)   -to contribute with funds and expertise to the solution of
cri;°cal adjustrient problems that are thenselves a result
of Mexico'3 contrnued growth, such as urban concentration,
enviroraerital p,ro&blems  etc.

> t IlI TKE STEEL SECTOR
t.aneral
MaeXLcols '-dustrial sector has been the most dynamic element
Ln the economioy over tfhe last 25 years. Its average annual rate oZf growth
accelerated to 83o6 percent in real terms during the 1960's, from 7.5 per-
cent ir, the preceding decades. With a one-third share of GDP and about
2, *zercent oi^ the national labor for-ce, it thereby was a major contributor

Ia-st decacO. Constracti_o_ ..;as been another buoyant sector, with an average
arnual grs -,. rate duri.ng the 1960's of over 9 percent. The two sectors
together hive been the nrimua.y determinants of increasing demand for steel.
Yocz     aron; ad steel industry is one of the oldest in Latin

Because of technical limitations, the effective capacity of the above

Steel Demand and Sual
8.       Apparent consumption of steel products in Mexico has increased
at an annual average of 8.3 percent over the past decade, reaching an
estimated 3.1 million tons in 1972 - equivalent to about h42 million tons
of crude steel. It is projected that the future growth of consumption
will accelerate to 10.4 percent annually and lead to an estimated product
demand of 6.7 million tons by 1980o This forecast justifies substantial
increases in Mexican production capacity, both for crude steel and for
finished steel products, provided costs are internationally competitive.
9.       The consumption of light non-flat products,1/ which are of specific
relevance for the SICARTSA steel project, constitutes roughly 40 percent
of the present steel market and grew at an annual rate of about 6.8 per-
cent over the last decade to 1.2 million tons in 19720 Fhture demand for
these products is expected to grow at a faster average annual rate of 9
percent to 2.8 million tons in 1980, due in part to the projected acceler-
ation in Government housing and public works programs. The present
effective rolling capacity for light non-flat products is estimated at
1/ Wire rods, bars and shapes.



millIon tons, but no more than two-thirds o:' this level has acually
been utilized in anj one year due to i.balances in. the various production
units. Using conservat-ive assumptions with regard to increased crude
steel and rolling capacity utilization for the 2uture, it has been projected
th,at the supply of light non-flat products without SICARTSA would be about
one million tons short of projected demand in 1980.
10i          ex:ico imfqports about 600,000 tUons of' scrao per year for use
,rrmarily in the se-    'e-rated steel planits. Imports of rero-llable
--terir' ~-o;nt -vo about 160,000 tons annually and imports of finished
seel products - mainly specialty steel's - have levelled at about 180,000
'COi. aXEMiZaIlly in recent': yea-ro  Eports of stieel. products have been sporadic
ad have not exceeded 30C>9,000 tons in any one year.  Imports and exports
o-' the types of produc"c. SI"-t4C.SA -will produce have been negligible in the

,e-IerElly h.:igher than world market Drices. Mex:Lcan p-rocuacers have operatec

>-ru:ch has anabbled them to remaia financially viable despite some ineff-
'ciencies caused by poor plant locations (vis-a-vis raw materials and
.._rkets) and outdated technology. The industry today. therefore, is
cnaracteri.ed by L;> Laces anong production units and poor economies of
5cale, yielding relatively high production costs.
T2 his situaltion hn  not been static, however.  AXMSA is now
completing a product-ion balancing scheme that should improve its efficiency,
and simila. steps are under way at 3tndidora, which last year took on
-`iopon Ste,i- Corporation of Japan. as an equity anid technical partner.
£till. nei;her oe thsse .I Lits offers the opportunity for significant
eo,noniWs ,hrougn; eZcpanSiorL, due primarily to locational problems. The
_conomic eqpansion potertial of the smaller producers also is seriously
ccn,t-rained
AiI ' o these f'actors havre created a need -'or Mexico's next
~a  r production increase to be undertaken in a .aew location following
>`ferent ;riaciples than were applied in the pE.st. W*With this has come
-c parallel need to rethink the steel pricing structure of the country



so as to best utilize, for the benefit of Mexico, whatever efficiencies
such new capacity will introduce. And, finally, improvements in the
institutional structure for defining and administering national policy
towards development of the steel industry have been found necessary.
Steel Sector and Project Objectives
14.         Bank participation in the Las Truch-as Project is designed to
help Mexico meet the above needs. It is a pro;ect structured in accord-
ance with sound technical and economic principles, and promises to yield
production economies that will make it internationally competitive and
encourage improvements in other Mexican plants under competitive con-
ditions. Institutionally, the project has served as a vehicle for the
Government to form a National Iron and Steel Coordinating Commission with
the task of analyzing the structure of the existing Lndustry and recommenc-
ing future policies for production, expansion, promotion of technology,
and incentives. The Government has undertakenr.
i)    to prepare a plan for the coordination of future steel
expansion;
ii)    to approve or support further expansion of existing steel
plants only when market demand and economic justification
have been clearly established;
iii)    to carry oat reviews of steel prices fro:n time to tize in
order to maintain prices at levels that (a) are reasonably
related to Mexican production costs and xorld pr-ice levels
and (b) are such as to allow steel consumers in Mexico to
share in any decline in production costs through redactions
in steel prices.
Furthermore, the project's role in a general economic sense is broadened
by its support for the Government's goal of directing public investment
towgards under-developed areas of Mexico and away fromL the concentrated
wealth and economic activity of the nation's major urban areas.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
15.         A report entitled "Appraisal of the Las Truchas Steel Projec-t9S,
No. 220-ME of August 10, 1973, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A summary of the Project is in Annex III.
16.         The Las Truchas project was appraised by Bank missions in
several stages between November 1972 and June 1973, in close cooperation
with the Inter-American Development Bank. Negotiations took place from
August 6 to August 10, 1973. SICARTSA was represented by Ing. !.i Orive
Alba, Director-General;  NAFIN by Lic. P. Galicia Estrada, !Manager;  and
the Government of Mexico by Lie Carlos Vidali, Advisor to -the 7ubdirector



of Public Credit I  rlis-niy of Finance. Negotiat,ions bOetween- the -DB
and the Mexicaon Delegat-cn took place in parallel to the Bank's nego-
ti ations. The 1D3 loan s-Uri be for $54 million, The IDB expects to

Iron Ore
20.         The Las Truchas iron ore is located in sev. eral deposits, all
in close pC:;mi0 y &nd roughly 19 kca fro-m the plant szte. The primary
ores are r_g.: t :c:, wirh haematite  iri the upper layers of some of the
denosits. Nieaeb-le resk _ es of' the Las Truchas deposIts are expected to



- 7 -
total over 76 million tons with an average soluble fron (Fe) co.tent
of about 51 percent. These reserves will be sufficLent for over 30
years of Stage I operation or, alternatively, wrill allow a significant
portion of Stage II production to be based on t:his -ron ore. In addition
to the proven reserves, it is likely that mineable raserves will amount
to more than is known today, bearing in mind that the mining exploration
program will continue in the Las Truchas area.
Other Inputs
21.         Coal will be entirely imported since no suitable coking coals
are available in the vicinity of the project aud transporting Hexico s
relativel2y low-quality coals from the distant northern part of the country
would be uneconomic. Long-term overseas coal sources are being studied
and no supply problems are anticipated. Limest-one, :uanganese ore,
bentonite and minor raw materials will be obtained 4rom Mexican sources.
Electric energy will be available from the nearby La Villita hydroelectric
power station, and water will come from the adjacentu Balsas River.
Infrastructure
22.         SICARTSA will utilize the new port of Lazaro Cardenas which ia
already under construction by the Government5 Tilth a 200-me-ter cuay
reserved for SICARTSA traffic - initially imports of equipment and coal
and out-ward shipments of about 10 percent of finished products. The port
plans have been reviewed by the Bank and are considered technically and
economically sound. A new city of Lazaro Cardenas is to be constructed by
a Governrent trust fund providing residential and commercial facilities
for SICARTSA's 4,000-man Stage I work force.
23.         Most of SICARTSA's output will be :Juoved inland to the princip;L
markets. There are a nunber of transport alte:;rnatives, reqairing varyviln
amounts of invesument for new faciiities or im:rovezaents to existing trans-
port systems. After exhaustive studies to detarmine the means of trans-
porting the projected steel output at the lowest eccnomic cost, the
Governmernt has opted for a two-stage solution. During the first two years
of operation, road transport over the existing highway to Nueva Italia
and from there by rail to final destinations i3 considered to be the best
solution, unless studies still in progress demonstrate that it is preferazle
to ship part of the output of Las Truchas by sea to Manzanillo during this
period for onward transport by rail. In 1978 a new railway link will be
completed to connect Lazaro Cardenas with the rest of the railway system
at Nueva Italia, and products then will be shipped by rail. The Government
has assured the Bank that it will allocate sufficient financial resources
to carry out the necessary transport infrastructure investments0
Environmental Protection
24.         The steps being taken by SICARTSA to minimize the adverse
environmental effects of the mine and steel works are above average for
a project of thds type. Hore general environmental problems are
associated with development of the port, the city, and regional infrastructure.

sources:

Total Financing                   678.5
30.         The Company's equity requirement during the construction
period of $300 million equivalent will be met by the existing share-
holders, according to an agreed schedule (para. 17).
31.         The proposed Bank loan to SICARTSA of $710.0 million would be
for 15 years, including a five-year grace period. In addition to the
interest payable to the Bank of 7-1/4 percent per anaum, the company would
pay to the Govern.ment a guarantee fee of 1-3/4 perceat per annum on the
outstanding amount, thereby raising the total (cost to 9 percent. The ID"
loan would be on similar terms, but at 8 percent annual interest plus a
single payment of three-eighths of one percent as a guarantee fee. Both
Banks are recommending five-year grace periods in order to ease SICARTSA? s
expected liquidity problems during the start-up period when production wiLll
be well below capacity (see para. 40 below). This means that the first
repayment would not fall due until about 2 years after project completion.
32.         The proposed Bank loan is intended to fizance some $62 million
(c, & f.) costs of equipment, spare parts and building structures acquired
through international competitive bidding, and about $8 million of interest
during construction, The Bank loan is expected to be utilized as follows,

Since no Mexican supplier could meet prequalificatior± criteria for
such overall responsibility, an incentive to use Mexican reso-urces is
given to non-Mexican bidders by way of a 15 percent margin of preference
(or the prevailing import duty in Mexico, if lower than 15 percent) on
the clearly identified Mexican components of non-Mexican bids. For this
purpose, a component is dfined as being of Mexican origin when supplied
by a company incorporated in Mexico and the costs of local materials,
labor and services used in its manufacture are aot less than 50 percent
of the total value of the component. In those cases where Mexican companaes
can prequalify to bid directly, and not simply as sub-suppliers, their
bids are considered entirely Mexican when Mexican value added reaches 50
percent. Procurement under the IDB loan will follow similar principles.
Bilaterally financed items are being procured under the same general
principles of international competitive bidding as those folio-wed for the
Bank and IDB items, except that credit terms are being taken into con-
sideration during bid evaluations.
36.         Initial letuters of intent to place orders for items proposed
for Bank finance were issued by SICARTSA in July, and some firm orders were
placed during August with full adherence to the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement and in full consultation with Bank staff. In view of the need
to maintain project schedules, I recommend that the Executive Directors
agree to retroactive financing of up to $3 million to cover the expenditures
likely to be made prior to the signing of the proposed loan.

in light non-flat steel products expected to reach about one million tors
by 1980. The details are shown below:

of the Government Is ratLon&I'zation of the existing price structare
(para. 13)   For I  _osos of the L'.s Truchas appraisal, it has been
assumed that some increase in price ceilings will be allowed before
SICARTSA begins proCduct-ior in 1976 and that real prices at that tine
will be  oUi,u 2-3 percent above present price levels,  On this basis,
the average price n. 1973 currency for the assuried SICARTSA product miLx
will be about $185 per tcor  delivered Me:ico Cii-y. A2ter 1976, the basic
assumption is tit, SICAYTSA's real prices will d1ecrease by about one per-
cenr;; p  ,_s-: relative to ,costs. This very posoibly will be the Situat0on

42.         Using constant prices, the financial rate of ret-rn on total
capital is projected at 11 percent. Profitability forecasts show losses
for the 2 year start-up period, but increasing profits after that.  Cumulative
net cash generation through 1985, the tenth year of operations, is pro-
jected at $325 million, providing a substantial contribution to new in-
vestment and expansion.
43.         A sensitivity analysis was run on the basis of the expected
production and sales build-up period of 2-1/2 years and another assuming
an extended 5-1/2 year build-up period. Variations of these options in
turn were run to determine the likely effect of an additional cost/price
squeeze of one percent per annum, an increase or a reduction in 4he capital
costs of $60 mil lion, a one-year production start-up delay, and a 15 percent
increase in operation costs. The most detrimental hypothesis - a start-up
delay and cost overrun, together with a 5-1/2 year build-up period - reduced
the rate of return to 8 percent.
44,         Debt service coverage during the critical years of operation -s
shown in para. 41. The lower 1976 and 1977 figures are consistent with
SICARTSA's projected needs for additional financing during those years (the
overrun guarantee will still be in effect) From 1978, the company begins
to cover its interest and principal payments obligations, and a healthy
coverage of two times or greater is projected.
Economic Justification
45.         The Las Truchas Project is judged the best of various alternatives
for the next step in Mexico's steel expansion program.  The project's
location adjacent to its iron ore supply and a deep-water port facility
will give it raw material advantages unmatched at arn of the locations of
the existing Mexican producers and is in line wfith the emerging worldwide
pattern of placing new steel works at coastal sites. Its proximity to the
main steel markets in Mexico will give the project further long-run
advantages over its major competitors.
46.         The basic economic rate of return is 12-13 percent for the
likely range of import prices discussed above. This has been calculated
using the financial cost estimates, with taxes removed, and with economic
price increases for energy, port and transport costs. Using a combinatiori
of unlikely unfavorable events, the return could drop as low as 8 percent
but, overall, the probability of an economic rate exceeding 10 percent is
very high.- Regional or secondary effects of the project have not been taken
into account in the analysis, although they may be considerable and should
contribute to the Government's objectives of regional development.

THE ECONOMY
(This is a reproduction, with some updating, of paragraphs 2-13
of the Presidentts Report P-1207a-XE dated May 30, 1973)
1.        During 1960-70 Mexican GNP in real terms grew, on average, at 7.1 per-
cent per annum, and in 1972 reached a level of about US$750 per capita. During
the decade of the 1960's the share of manufacturing in total output rose front
23 to 34 percent while the share of agriculture declined from 16 to 12 percent.
Agriculture continues to be the main source of employment although its share in
the labor force, which was 58 percent in 1960, had fallen to 39 percent by 1>70.
Labor employed in manufacturing, during the same period, rose from 16 to 23 per-
cent of the labor force. Income disparities between social groups fn Mexico
historically have been great, and continue to be sD, notwithstanding that Mexico
is one of the few countries in which a major land reform :- a result of the
Revolution of 1910 - has taken place, and in which about one-half of all crop
land is exploited on a communal (ejido) basis.
2.         The high rate of population growth (3.4 percent) and the relative
scarcity of arable land have contributed to the very rapid growth of the urban
population. Since 1960 it has risen by some 5 percent annually, and in 1970
accounted for about 60 percent of tthe total population, the metropolitan regions
of the three largest cities, Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara grew ever
faster than the overall urban population.
3,        Unemployment was recorded at around 9 pe:ccent in 1970 while an additional
30 percent of the economically active population were employed in activities of
such low productivity as to be cornsidered underemployed.   Moreover, because of
the increase in population and its present age structure, the labor force will
continue to grow very rapidly.
4.        President Echeverria, who has held office since the end of 1970, has
stated that his Government is strongly committed to a po-licy of economic growth
with income redistribution, and has expressed particular concern for the problem
of rural poverty. In the past two years the Government has initiated several
measures designed to improve the earning and living conditions of the rural poor.
These include the enactment of a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new Water Law
(1971), instructions to the banking system to channel part of its resources to
small farmers and ejidatarios, and the appropriation of funds in the national
budget for an integrated rural development and works program. The new Agrarian
Reform Law is directed to strengthening the legal bases oL the ejido, to accel-
erating the awards of final land titles and to granting individual small holders
similar rights to those of ejidatarios. The new Water Law restricts individual
land holdings in new irrigation districts to 20 ha.; the excess land is to be
distributed to small farmers and landless families. The small farmers' credit
program seeks to improve credit institutions and increase amounts to ejidatarios
and small farmers. The rural development program, for which the Government ha.
appropriated Mex$2.5 billion (US$200 million) in the fiscal 1973 budget, withL the
intention of spending about Mex$15 billion in 1973-76, is in the process of bei?g
defined and is meant to help the landless and seasonally unemployed poor as well
as to improve the productive base of small holders and ejidatarios. It is too
early to evaluate the impact of these policies, but they undoubtedly respond to
some of Mexico's most serious development problems.

Between 1960 and 1971 :i.l share of investment in GDP rose from about
17 to almost 20 percent.   By 1971 some 88 percent of gross domestic investments
- 16.4 percent of GDP - were being financed by internal savings. While total
savings are thus cuite high, public sector savings need to be increased:    Public
investr.menLs amount to less thari one-third of totail investmc-fit, but public savings
mpake up only about one-fourLh of total savings.   It is the unusually great wi' Iilna-
ness of t!-e ?7-'ate sector to save that has ?er-mitted tse Gover,nment to m..aintain
taxes at the low level of 9 percenz or GDP, but a greatar pul-ic savings effort

7, ,      Between 1960 and 1970 exports of goocds and services rose by arn average
of 9 percent Der annum; merclnarnase exports grew at a 6.3 pe--cent per annum rate
ane tourist earnings at 15 perce.e-t per annu-im.  Export g:-owthi slowed appreciably
in 1971, ,ecause of tnle U.S. recession and because of uncertainties in tne irter
national monetary s,tuation.   -n 1972, however, expansion res,med; in the 'irst
n!.-' --e mtionthris exports of -man-;ufactures -cse Dy about 30 percen- and tota! merchandise

tl-.e scope of tax rcfunds for exporters and the legislation on border industries
s_te  especially promising.  The :oreseeable ra-e of growth of manufactured
exzr-Dts over the n2xt few; years is of t-.e order of 18 percen' per an-num.
While ?u--,ic external borrowing increased aga-n during 1972 wit:n
s tepec-up? public investmentr, the Gove-rn-ment's sournd debt ma-agement policies
CG-.:I ned with subsZantial lendi ng- by th-e Wor-ld Bank and the 1DB have kept the
matrity and terLms structure of .,uch borrowings within reason,able limits.
Private capital inflows have cor,ninued at a hich level.   Overall, Mexico's net
inr.er-ational rese--ves increased by $190 million during 1972 to $1,200 million.
The ratio of payments fo-L debt service to receipts from exports of goods and
ser-vices, wh!ich in 1972 was an e. i-iated 2v pe!-cent, is expected to peak in the
_at.- t seven:ies at near 25 percent a-nd should decline thereafter.  During the

10.       Mexico has demonstrated over a considerable time that it can absorb,
and utilize effectively, appreciable amounts of external capital. At the same
time the external finances have generally been handled in a prudent manner, while
domestic policies have generated private sector confidence both in the currency
and in the economy.  Indications are that these policies will continue as the
public sector initiates a more ambitious expenditure policy in order to address
Mexico's more intractable development problems, especially those of the rural
poor. If such policies are supported by corresponding action to channel more
resources to the public sector, Mexico will remain creditworthy for substantial
external borrowing on conventional terms.
ll.        In addressing some of the socio-economic problems referred to above,
public investments will have to grow in sectors in which the import component of
investment is small. Moreover, Mexico has a highly developed industrial sector
and increasingly Mexican products are competing successfully under international
competitive bidding.  External lenders, if they are to make a suitabLe contribution
to MexicoTs development, and one that is consistent with overall balance of payments
requirements, will have to cover part of the local expenditures of the projects to
which they attach their financing.
12.        During the first half of 1973 the Mexican economy has been subjected to
the same inflationary strains as most other countries. Imported inflationary
pressures were strengthened by a domestically generated increase in money supply
which has its causes in expanded Government outlays and an increased private ssctor
demand. GDP grew at an annual rate of 8 percent in real terms so far this year.
The Mexican authorities are somewhat concerned about the danger of overheating of
the economy and have recently taken a number of monetary measures, including an
increase in the reserve requirements of the banking system, raising the interest
rates for bankiing liabilities in order to attract both domestic and foreign savings,
and selected increases in lending rates of the banking system.   The financial
authorities are also considering the early implementation of a number of measures
in the public finance field which focus on the restructuring of prices of public
enterprises.  Beyond this, they have already made considerable progress in improving
tax administration in order to increase tax revenues.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
(The following is a reproduction, updated and shortened, of paragraphs
14-18 of the President's Report, P-1207a-ME of May 30, 1973).
1.          The Bank has made 32 loans, for a t'otal of US$1,529.3
million net of cancellations, of which at the end of July 1973 the
Bank held US$1240.9 million, including US$505.6 million not yet dis-
bursed.  Most of these loans have been made for power, roads and agri-
culture0  Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory. As I have explained to the Executive Directors (R73-23
of February 1, 1973) the Government has not found it possible to effect
the needed power tariff increase and orly $35 million of the $125
million loan (834-ME) would be drawable unless the CFE adopts adequate
measures to present an acceptable program for financing itis investment
needs.
2. *IFC has made ten investment commitments in Mexico amounting
to US$53.1 milion, of which. as of July 31, 1973, US$35.3 million had
been sold, terminated or cancelled. The US$17,8 million held by the
Corporation consists of US$i6.0 million in loans and US$1.8 million in
equity. ThIs Annex presents a summary of Bank loans and IFC investments
as of July 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
3.          The FY73 lending program consisted of a Mexico City Water
Supply Project and a Livestock and Agriculture Development Project,
totalling US$200 million. In the nextW six months or so I hope to oressent
to the Executive Directors three projects that are in an advanced stage
of preparation. Now in the process of appraisal are two irrigation
projects - on the Sinaloa and Panuco Rivers - end a highways project.
In addition, we are holding discussions with the Mexicans or several trans-
port, forestry and rural development projects, some of which are expected
to be ready for consideration later in FY74.
4.      ... The irrigation projects are designed not only to help provide
a rapidly growing population with its food, fiber, and foreign exchange
requirements, but also to support the Governmernt's policies on income
redistribution as expressed in the Land Reform and Water Laws, both of
1971.  Loans in the transport and power sectors are designed explicitEly
to help inprove institutional structures and policies in sectors that play a
vital role in irdustrial eand agricultural production and ir the generaStion
and utilization of public sector resources. The recent Bank-assisted
agricultural credit project has a component earmarked for low-income
farmers and peasants; if this operation is successful it should lay the
foundation for a wider attack on rural poverty in the future. At the same
time, the Government, together with the Bank, is attempting to prepare
integrated rural investment projects in regions in which income levels are
low but where some productive potential can be identified.

747        Third Livestock and Agriculture Project:  $75 million loan of
June 9, 1971; closing date:   September 30, 1       Disburse-
ments are somewhat behind earlier projections but commitments
of sub-loans are proceeding well and the loan funds are expected
to be fully committed by December 1973.
793        Tourism I, Zihutane.jo:  $22 million loan o   janua  22. 1972;
closing date: December 31, 1975. Though the loan became
effective only on March 31, 1973, the Dhysical performance under
the project is satisfactory.
820        Ports I:  120 million loan of May 17, 1972; _closin   date:
June 30, 1976. The proJect is going ahead satisfactorily,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender doc-umernts0
The operations consultants financed under the loani have
completed much of their work. An exte:.sion of their contract
will be necessary, however, in order to implement their
recommendations and to complete tariff studies.  Negotiations
are under way between the Government and the firm selected to
carry out the National Ports Development Study.
824        Industries II, FONEI:  $35 zillion loan of June 2, 1972;   closing
date: June 30, 1976. The loan became effective on October 12,
1972. It has taken more time than was originally envisaged to
staff and organize FONEI fully.  Two sub-loans have recently been
approved. Discussions with the Bank ase in progress on how to
expedite execution of the project.
825        Railways II:  $75 million loan of June 2, 1972;   closing date:
December 31, 1975. Implementation of -,he Investment Plan and
procurement financed by the loan are p-ogressing well;   a slow
stiart has been made on the Plan of Action, and little progress
has yet been made on several required studies. A new management
team was appointed in May 1973. Operating results to date have
been much as forecast, with an improved operating ratio. Trans-
port planning at the Government level has, however, made little
progress.
834        Fourth Power Sector Program:   $125 million loan of June 23, 1972-
closing date: December 31, 1974. The loan became effective on
April 13, 1973. Increase in power tariffs by December 31, 1972
was originally a condition of effectiveness of this loan.   In
December 1972 the Government and CFE (the borrowing Federal
Electricity Commission) informed the Bank that for reasons of
domestic economic policy, they would not be able to put the elect-
ricity rate increase in effect by December 31. The loan inclueci
$35 million for joint financing of further payments due on orders
placed before December 31, 1971. With the approval of lxecutive
Directors (R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the Loan Agreemzent was
amended to separate this $35 million from the remainder;   this
