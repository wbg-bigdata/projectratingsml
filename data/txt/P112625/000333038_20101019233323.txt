Financing Data           Standard IDA Terms, 20 years to maturity including a 10-year grace period
ODeration Tvoe           Development Policy Operation (DPO)
Main Policy Areas        (i) Economic management, (ii) private sector development.
                         Key outcome indicators which mutually support economic recovery and social
                         protection against the crisis, are:
                         (i) Increase in road maintenance budget;
                         (ii) Increased share of agricultural subsidies spent on investment and received by
                         individual farmers;
Key Outcome Indicators   (iii) at least 2 thirds of eligible beneficiaries receive TSA in 20 10;
                         (iv) Increased volume of wine exports; higher real farm gate prices for grapes;
                         (v) No further accumulation of arrears for gas supply;
                         (vi) At least one private operator licensed to connect cross-border fiber optic
                         cable;
                         (vii) Reduced times to register a business.
                         The program's objectives are to:
Program Development      Adequately fund priority expenditures for economic recovery and social
Objective(s) and         protection during fiscal correction and lay foundations for a sustained post-crisis
Contribution to CAS      recovery through exports and private investment.

                         This proposed operation replaces and scales up the third annual PRSC identified
                         in the FY09-FY 1 1 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The proposed operation
                         realigns World Bank policy based lending support to reflect the changed
                         economic and political realities. The reform program supported by the operation:
                         (i) aligns behind the policy shift signaled by a new Government, and (ii) responds
                         to the new challenge of addressing the global crisis by complementing an IMF-
                         supported program for fiscal correction with measures to improve the
                         composition of the budget and structural measures to stimulate economic
                         recovery. The increase in funding from $10m to $25 million reflects the need for
                         additional budgetary funding to smooth over fiscal correction of a deficit of close
                         to 7 percent of GDP in 2009.
                         Moldova faces the likelihood of a third round of Parliamentary elections before
                         September 2010, after Parliament again failed to elect a new President. This
                         political backdrop heightens the risk that some overdue fiscal and structural
                         policies may not get implemented on time, leading to less orderly adjustment and
Risks and Risk
                         prolonged recession. Economic recovery depends strongly upon recovery in the
Mitigation

                         deterioration in their loan performance. As the global crisis and the energy and
                         food crises and wine export ban which preceded it all show, as a small open
                         economy Moldova is highly susceptible to balance of payments shocks.

                               OPERATION MOLDOVA
                                  I.    INTRODUCTION
1.     This program document describes a proposed Economic Recovery Development
Policy Loan of US $25 million equivalent to the Republic of Moldova. It supports a reform-
minded Government as it starts to implement measures to address a deep fiscal crisis brought on
by the global recession and pre-election spending and policy drift. It does so during a period of
continued political uncertainty in which the new Parliament has twice failed to elect a President,
meaning that another round of general elections is likely in the second half of 2010. The
operation is therefore designed as a bridge to a longer term program of annual support which
could be developed once political uncertainty abates.

2.     This proposed operation realigns World Bank policy support lending to reflect
Moldova's greatly changed economic and political priorities. The Moldova Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) programmatic series, which consisted of three operations of
US $10 million each, was discontinued after PRSC2. In the run-up to two elections in April and
July 2009, several actions proposed under the cancelled PRSC3 were delayed and partially
implemented. Now in the wake of elections and after the full impact of the global crisis has
taken its toll on the economy, Moldova's financing needs have increased dramatically and the
new Government has set out a new policy framework to stabilize the economy through fiscal
correction (with IMF support) and stimulate medium term growth in trade and investment. The
IMF staff estimates that US$ 1.25 billion in external financing will be required over the three
years from 2010-12. On January 29th the Executive Board of the IMF approved a three year
arrangement providing US $574 million including US $150 million as budget support to
maintain stability with strong but phased fiscal adjustment. This operation starts the realignment
of World Bank policy based support with the Government's `Economic Stabilization and
Recovery Program'. The Bank intends to continue to help the Government to complete their
reform agenda for economic recovery once the political situation is resolved.

3.    The operation will support short-term corrective policies in the new Government's
`Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program' in two ways. The program supports many
actions that are mutually reinforcing: they aim both to stimulate economic recovery, and to
cushion the impact of the severe crisis-induced recession on poor people.

  0   First, the program helps to protect priority expenditures for economic recovery and
      social protection during fiscal correction. The operation supports enhanced fimding
      for targeted social assistance and road maintenance and a redirection of agriculture
      subsidies towards more efficient investment grants. The latter two actions should enhance
      economic activity. Whilst reducing vehicle operating costs in the economy and
             preserving public investments, the increase in road maintenance will also help employ
             returning migrants and recently unemployed construction workers.

         0   Second the operation will lay the foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery
             through exports and private investment. It will assist Government to remove long-
             standing structural policy constraints and cumbersome regulations which retard
             improvements in Moldova's productivity and competitiveness, restrain exports, limit
             foreign direct investment, and which have led to jobless growth in recent years. The
             removal of these constraints should dampen the recession and place Moldova on firmer
             foundations for growth and job creation once export demand recovers. Since the impact
             of the crisis on poor people in Moldova will be more acute in rural areas, emphasis is
             placed on measures which could stimulate traditional wine exports. Complementing these
             measures the program seeks to initiate reforms which first make the energy sector
             financially viable and which then pave the way for an injection of private investment in
             energy and telecommunications. The energy sector reforms supported should stem the
             drain of subsidized heating on Moldova's fiscal space, whilst protecting poor people from
             rising heating costs and providing a framework for cost-cutting energy efficiency
             measures in future. With limited scope for a fiscal stimulus in Moldova, and slow
             recovery forecast in the region, attracting new foreign investment in telecommunications
             and eventually energy could provide a much needed private investment stimulus to the
             economy in the coming years. Despite the global crisis, there is interest from private
             investors in both sectors.

4.    The proposed operation, is underpinned by extensive economic and sector work.
This was conducted over the last five years and is summarized in the Policy Notes prepared for
the new Government'.

                                                       CONTEXT

    5.     Last year was a turbulent year in Moldovan politics, which ended - as it had started
    - with political uncertainty.                                                         '
                                    Two fiercely fought Parliamentary elections (April 5 and July
    29') distracted Government from economic management priorities just as the onset of the
    global crisis on Moldova was becoming most evident. The results ofthe first Parliamentary
    elections were contested in demonstrations that spilled over into civil unrest. Following the
    second Parliamentary elections, a new coalition of four liberal democratic parties eventually
    formed the Alliance for European Integration (AEI) in Au ust 2009. Holding 53 of 101 seats in
    Parliament, they formed a Government on September 25t f, replacing the Party of Communists
    of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) who had been in office for 8 years. The new Parliament
    failed twice to elect a President2. Another round of general elections is therefore likely in the
    second half of 201 0.

6.     Moldova reacted late to the economic crisis. Being more focused on April 2009
elections, the previous Government reacted slowly and inappropriately to the sharp rebalancing
of the economy which the worsening external environment in 2009 had caused. Against falling
tax revenue, they increased public servants' wages and pensions well above available budget
resources in the run-up to April elections, and then promised two further wage increases for
teachers and all public servants in advance of July elections. This has resulted in Moldova
having one of the highest public wage bills in Eastern Europe, and bucking the trend of wage
cuts elsewhere in the region in response to the crisis. Early in 2009, facing pressure on the
exchange rate from reduced remittances, the National Bank of Moldova lost a third of their
international reserves in attempts to defend the currency. This sharply tightened liquidity and
hiked up real interest rates despite falling inflation and economic activity, and an increase in
non-performing bank loans. The introduction of new targeted social assistance and gradual
reform of the old schemes was delayed, preventing improved targeting to those most in need. In
May 2009 the previous Government allowed the IMF supported PRGF program to expire. In
June, after inviting the IMF back to Chisinau for an assessment, they were reluctant to make the
necessary fiscal correction in the face of political tension and facing a second election.

7.     Even with political uncertainty, the new Government has begun to implement
comprehensive reform that will entail a shift in economic management and international
development relations. Immediately upon taking office in late September, Government took
on the challenge of correcting for the impact of the global crisis on Moldova's economy. In
October, the Government launched the `Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan' (ESRP)
which sets the policy framework for this development policy operation. In early November they
had reached agreement in principle with the IMF staff on a program for the use of Fund
resources, which formed the basis of a 3 year Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund
Facility program approved in January 20 10. Under the ESRP, Government began implementing
a comprehensive and detailed action plan of legal and administrative reforms to "de-regulate,
liberalize and de-monopolize" the economy. Government also began implementing an action
plan for integration with Europe, entitled "European Integration: Freedom, Democracy, Welfare
2009-2013", which aspires to make the Republic of Moldova eligible for EU accession "in a
reasonable time". The strategy also seeks to develop strategic partnerships with the EU,
Romania, Ukraine, Russian Federation and the USA. In response, the European Union is
proposing to include Moldova into the EU Eastern Partnership initiative. At the end of
November the Government concluded a Compact Program with the US Millennium Challenge
Corporation which was signed late January 2010.

8,     The international community is providing strong support. The Consultative Group
meeting on Moldova, jointly organized by the EU and the World Bank in March 2010,
reinforced the donor's commitment to support Moldova's socioeconomic development plan,
summarized in its strategic document Rethink Moldova. The CG meeting raised a total of US$
2.6 billion to support the implementation of the reform strategy over the period 2010-12.

9.     Moldova's economy is in recession. The global crisis undermined all of the main
sources of growth in previous years - remittances, private consumption, exports, and private
investment, resulting in weaker domestic and external demand, fiscal imbalance, limited
financial intermediation, and an increase in the level of poverty.

10. Prior to the crisis, economic growth in Moldova had averaged 6 percent between
2004 and 2008, on the back of strong domestic and external demand. The massive inflow
of migrant workers' remittances (averaging about 31 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2008)
fuelled a rapid increase in consumption and an even larger increase in the private investment
share of GDP, with most of this coming as construction of residential property. Domestic
absorption by 2008 had reached 151 percent of GDP, with private absorption at 128 percent.
Consumption rose in real terms by an average of 6.7 percent over the period 2004-2008 (see
Figure 1). Offsetting a gradual decline in terms of trade from an increased price of imported
energy and shocks to agricultural exports, the increase in disposable income propelled growth in
imports of goods and services, leading to a deterioration of the current account deficit from 1.8
percent of GDP in 2004 to 16.3 percent by the end of 2008. At the same time, strong currency
appreciation pressure from foreign exchange inflows and an improvement in Moldova's
investment climate brought about a sharp rise in private investment expenditure, especially from
2006. Investment was partly financed by the banking sector - domestic credit to the private
sector rose by over one third from 27.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 36.9 percent of GDP in 2007
(36.5% in 2008), as a result of the enhanced growth of loan demand from the industry and trade
sectors. Net foreign direct investment became an important source of financing for investment
in 2007 and 2008, reaching 12.2 percent of GDP in 2007, and remaining at 11.7 percent in 2008
compared to just 5.6 percent in 2004. While 2009 data are still being finalized, early indications
- discussed below - are that foreign direct investment collapsed to just 1.6 percent of GDP in
2009, whilst remittances ended the year down 37.4 percent on 2008 levels.

1 1. Growth was driven by remittance-financed consumption and investment from 2004
to 2008, which together widened the balance of trade. Whereas real exports grew faster than
real GDP during the period (figure l), export growth was mostly in services and non-traditional
exports. Service exports closed the gap on merchandise exports, growing from one third of
merchandise exports in 2004 to two thirds by 2008. However, service export growth was almost
wholly offset by growth in service imports. Traditional primary exports (wine, agriculture and
livestock based products) fell sharply as a share of GDP in the decade 1998-2008 (figure 2), but
especially in the 3 years following Russia's export ban on Moldovan bulk wine in 2006. As
discussed below, new Moldovan regulations on the wine sub-sector are seen as having
accentuated the impact of the wine ban on the sector. Private investment expenditure outpaced
that of consumption, making significant contributions to economic growth - Gross Fixed
Capital Formation (GFCF) grew by an average 14.3 percent between 2004 and 2008, compared
to an average of 6.7 percent real growth in final consumption. Investment and GDP statistics
both suggest that private investment was largely in residential property, as households used
remittances to build and buy housing. On a sectoral basis, the service sector accounted for all of
the increase in value-added growth between 2004-2008, as both agriculture and industry
declined on average. Real estate was the main sectoral contributor to annual real growth in gross
fixed capital formation, accounting for well over one third of total real growth in GFCF between
2004 and 2007. National accounts data also suggest an investment price boom - the fastest
growing deflator between 2004 and 2008 was the private investment deflator. The second
fastest growing was the public consumption deflator.

    12. The government maintained fiscal balance with a modest deficit of 1 percent of GDP
    in 2008. Fiscal balance was driven more by increasing revenues than by expenditure restraint,
    since fiscal prudence should have generated budget surpluses during the period of high growth.
    Instead, between 2004 and 2008 growth in Government spending in Moldova kept pace with
    GDP growth. Buoyant revenue performance was driven mainly by robust VAT on remittance-
    funded imports. Tax revenues crept up by 3 percentage points of GDP between 2004 and 2008.
    Between 2005 and 2008, the cumulative growth in wages and capital expenditure exceeded
    those of tax revenue components. Perhaps most troubling, national accounts data show that
    between 2004-2008 public consumption rose by 5 percentage points of GDP. Total public
    current spending increased in this period by 4 percentage points of GDP (see Figure 3). Thus
    although there was balance in the fiscal accounts before the crisis, the public sector was
    expanding on the back of buoyant private foreign inflows. As noted in paragraphs 18 and 20,
    this deteriorating fiscal trend was greatly accentuated in 2009 when the former Government
    substantially raised public sector wages and pensions.

    13. The exposure of the private sector to external financing rose sharply between 2004
    and 2008. The private sector's external borrowing increased from 4 percent of GDP in 2004 to
    14 percent of GDP in 2008 - a high share of external debt by international standards. While
'
    banks' debt rose by nearly 700 percent within the period to USD 578 million in 2008, the bulk
    of private sector debt is non-bank consisting of trade credits, arrears, and other payment
    liabilities mostly from the imports of natural resources. The payment liabilities were generated
    as a result of heating tariffs being set below cost recovery levels in Chisinau, which led to
    arrears from the transmission and distribution company to the power generator, who in turn ran
    up arrears to the gas importer.

    14. The strong economic growth associated with rising real incomes played a critical
    role in the rapid reduction in poverty. According to the poverty assessment report and the
    recent poverty updates, poverty in Moldova fell from 30.2 percent in 2006 to 20.4 percent in
    2008. Extreme poverty also declined rapidly, falling from 4.5 percent in 2006 to below 2
    percent in 2008. The depth of poverty, measured by the poverty gap, also fell from 7.9 percent
    in 2006 to 5.2 percent in 2008. The level of inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient



                                                                 6
 remains around 30 percent, which is relatively low by international standards, but average by
 ECA regional standards. The decline in poverty was largely concentrated in urban areas and
 thus poverty in Moldova is becoming increasingly a rural phenomenon - in 2008, 73.2 percent
 of the poor lived in rural areas.

Impact of the Global Crisis

 15. The downturn in Moldova?s economy in 2009 is estimated to have increased the
 incidence of poverty in Moldova by 5 percentage points to 32 percent (see Figure 4). These
 staff estimates are derived from simulations that use the current macroeconomic projections for
 2009, and project the impact of a fall in all households? consumption in line with the decline in
 private consumption. These projections suggest that the poverty rate in Moldova will remain
 above the 2008 level until at least 201 1.

 16. The global crisis led to a sharp decline in GDP, exposing the unsustainable nature of
 remittance-financed and import-intensive economic growth. The effects of the global
 meltdown were transmitted to Moldova in the fall of 2008, as the recession hit major trading
 partners - Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Western Europe, leading to sharp falls in remittances
 and export earnings. Remittances drastically declined - by 37.4 percent (year on year) in 2009
 to 20.8 percent of GDP (from about 30 percent of GDP in 2008, see Figure 5), leading to a
 collapse in domestic demand. As a result, consumption expenditure shrunk by 6 percent (year
 on year) by the end of 2009. The volume of imports into Moldova also dropped by around 20
 percent (year on year) in 2009, much faster than the 7.8 percent fall in exports (see Figure 6)
 thereby narrowing the current account deficit to US $439 million in 2009, from US $987
 million in 2008. Similarly, investment expenditure was badly hit. By the end of 2009, GFCF
 had dropped by 31.3 percent from the previous year. The net flow of FDI also fell sharply
 during 2009, from US $707 million in 2008 to just US $86 million (see Figure 7).

17. The slowdown in investment, remittances, and exports put pressure on the exchange
rate. As foreign exchange inflows dried up and the Moldovan Lei came under devaluation
pressures in late 2008, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervened in support of the Lei,
resulting in the loss in international reserves of about 60 percent from the September 2008 peak
to US $1.1 billion by the end of March 2009 (see Figure 8). The fall in international reserves is
also traceable to the 8 percent points lowering of the required reserves of freely convertible
currencies of banks - a measure taken by monetary authorities to ease pressure on the banking
sector. From April to the end of December 2009, the Lei depreciated gradually vis-a-vis the US
dollar and the euro by 12.2 percent and 22.1 percent respectively, while international reserves
increased to USD 1.48 billion due primarily to the IMF's SDR allocation of US $185 million.

18. The recession widened the fiscal deficit. The fall in remittance-financed consumption
and imports led to a serious drop in VAT receipts, import duties and non-tax revenues, causing
fiscal revenue to fall by 8.8% in 2009 from a year earlier. Against this loss in revenues, wage
and pension spending increases and social payments caused recurrent public expenditure to rise
by about 5 percent by December 2009. Consequently the fiscal deficit increased from 1 percent
of GDP in 2008 to an unprecedented 6.8 percent of GDP by the end of 2009.

 19. All sectors in Moldova's economy contracted sharply in 2009 as the impact of the
 global meltdown weighed heavily on the real sector, putting downward pressure on prices
 and jobs. The 6.5 percent contraction in GDP in 2009 (see Figure 9), can be linked to the 22.2
 percent fall in output in the industrial sector3 during the year. Several sectors - including
 mining, agriculture and construction, recorded declines in output ranging from 12 percent to 60
 percent during 2009. Resulting job losses have pushed annual unemployment rates to 6.4
 percent, from 4 percent at the end of 2008 (see Figure lo), although with minimal effect on the
 growth of real (total) wages. Deflationary trends also emerged as a result of falling demand and
 output - annual inflation dropped to -0.6 percent at the end of the fourth quarter in 2009, from
 around 11 percent in September 2008.

 20. In contrast to the private sector, wages in the public sector are rising. Workers in the
 private sector have seen a significant decline in their real incomes in spite of disinflation.
 Annual growth in real wages in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and wholesale and
 retail trade (which together account for about 55 percent of the pre-crisis total labor force) has
 fallen dramatically since the onset of the crisis - construction workers have seen an 13.1
 percent pay cut on average. Total employment in these sectors combined fell by 8 percent
 (nearly 60,000 jobs) during 2009, compared with the previous year. In contrast, public sector
 wages are growing fast: average real wages in public administration and education sectors
 increased by around 14.1 percent and 28 percent in 2009 - a source of concern for the widening
 budget deficit.

 21. The banking sector's stability has come under severe strain as a result of the crisis
 and profits have been considerably hit. At the end of September 2008, the quality of the loan
 portfolio of the banks was relatively high - only 4.6 percent of loans were classified as non-
 performing, and loan loss reserves were almost at par i.e. 4.5 percent of total loans (see Table
 2). However, a rapid deterioration in loan quality occurred throughout 2009. The stock of NPLs
 stood at 16.3 percent of total loans while loan loss provisions lagged behind at 9.65 percent at
 the end of 2009. While banks have significant buffer to absorb some risks (i.e. capital adequacy
 ratio average about 32 percent, far above the minimum requirements of 12 percent), NPLs are
 expected to rise further, raising credit risks within the economy. The drop in remittances and
 early runs on deposits also exerted some pressure on liquidity - within a year of the


 Growth in the industrial sector has stalled since 2005 and the value of output has been dropping, owing to various
shocks, including energy price increases, drought, and the Russian ban on Moldovan exports.

commencement of the crisis in September 2008, total deposits in the banking system had fallen
by about MDL 3 billion (or 11 percent) to MDL 24.9 billion but recovered strongly to MDL
26.4 billion by December 2009. Bank profits have also fallen by more than 100 percent, i.e.
returns on assets and equity turned negative at the end of 2009.

22. Moldova is experiencing a credit crunch. Banks have responded to higher credit risks
and falling but ample liquidity by curtailing credit to the economy. While credit growth peaked
around January 2008 prior to the onset of the crisis, growth in credit to households and private
firms fell into negative territory for the first time in 2009 (see Figure 11). Risk-averse banks
have kept lending rates high in spite of falling inflation. Interest rates on MDL loans fell 400
basis points from a year earlier to around 18.6 percent in December 2009 whereas annual
inflation dropped 900 basis points to -0.6 percent within the same period. The real cost of
borrowing has therefore increased, making access to loans for working capital and investment
expensive for firms compressing demand (see Figure 12), and prolonging the "credit crunch"
which presents significant risks to economic recovery.

Medium Term Economic Prospects

 23. In spite of the recent downturn, medium-term economic growth is expected at 5
 percent per annum. But it will likely take about 4 years for the poverty rate in Moldova to
 return to the 2008 level. With the gradual recovery of external demand and remittances,
 investment is expected to grow by 6.8 percent in 2010 and at a lesser rate in subsequent years
 (see Table 3). GDP growth is projected at 2.5 per cent in 2010, recovering to an average of 5
 percent per annum by 2012. Aside from real investments, exports are also expected to be an
 important driver of growth once (i) trade partners recover from the crisis, and (ii) structural
 reform and liberalization in the business environment propel growth of services. Real export
 growth is projected at 5 percent by 2012.4

 24. The NBM is expected to adopt price stability as the primary objective of monetary
 policy. In reversal of the pervasive disinflation in 2009, consumer price inflation is projected to
 rise to 8.4 percent by end-2010 on the back of price pressures in the global energy market,
 recovery in demand, and monetary policy easing (if necessary). The focus on inflation targeting
 is expected to keep inflation low at around the 5 percent mark in the medium term. To this
 effect, the NBM has started (from January 2010) to publish quarterly reports providing analysis
 of monetary policy performance and inflation forecasts.

 25. The current account deficit is expected to narrow marginally to around 10 percent
 of GDP in the medium term, as export recovery outpaces growth in imports. While
 expectations for FDI inflows and higher energy prices may marginally widen the deficit position
 in the short term, it is projected that the increased competitiveness of Moldova's exports
 coupled with improvements in the terms of trade should gradually narrow the deficit to below
 10 percent by 20 13.




 These assumptions are conservative on the rebound in remittance growth, because at this stage little is known with
certainty about whether migrants have returned home to Moldova since the crisis.

26. Budget consolidation and a tighter fiscal policy are expected in the coming years
and are the cornerstone of the IMF-supported program. Expenditure restraint is central to
the Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program and to the IMF-supported program (Table 5
shows the fiscal correction which has already been taken into account in revising the 2009
budget and in formulating the 2010 budget). The fiscal adjustment program as set out in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with the IMF lays out the strategy
for the reduction of the deficit. The IMF program for 2010 targeted an adjustment in the
structural fiscal balance of 2 % percent of GDP in 2010. In the short term, the rationalization of
current expenditure through (i) postponing all wage increases for 2010 until 2012-13,
generating savings of MDLl.8 billion, (ii) freezing budgetary sector employment, yielding
savings of MDL 400 million, (iii) reducing agricultural subsidies by MDL 350 million; (iv)
raising excise tax rates to increase revenue by MDL 500 million, and (v) raising the VAT rate
on natural gas from 5 to 6 percent to achieve a gain of about MDL 200 million is expected to
reduce the general government deficit to 5.8 percent in 20 10. Longer term measures are expected to
drive down the deficit to 4 percent in 201 1, and to a manageable 2 percent of GDP by 20 12.

27. The level of public debt is projected to peak in 2011 as the result of IMF financing,
but to remain sustainable. Figure 13 presents results of debt sustainability stress tests. In the
base case scenario (see also Table 3), public debt (13.1 percent of GDP in 2008) is expected to
rise sharply as a result of the on-going economic crisis and rising fiscal deficit, reaching 34.9
percent by 201 1, Moldova has an unusually large private debt (the legacy of heating arrears)
hence external debt stock is projected to reach 79.9 percent of GDP by 2012. Total external debt
service will remain high at 19 percent of exports of goods and service until 2014. In a

pessimistic scenario, a significant depreciation of the exchange rates is expected to push public
debt around 40 percent of GDP by 201 1. (Refer to Joint Staff Debt Sustainability Analysis
IDA/SecM2010-0060).

28. These macroeconomic projections are consistent with the Government's three year
program with the IMF, which the World Bank team considers provides a credible medium
term macro framework. The Fund supported program hinges on reversing the fiscal
deterioration that occurred in 2008-9, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves whilst managing
inflation, and ensuring financial stability through early detection and strengthening the
framework for bank rehabilitation and resolution.

29. The outlook for household poverty is set to improve gradually (Figure 4 above).
Using these medium term economic projections, households' consumption per capita in real
terms will decline by close to 8 percent in 2009 (see Figure 14), but will marginally increase by

1.8 percent in 2010. Following the decline in consumption, the poverty headcount is projected
to increase from 27.4 in 2008 to 32.4 percent in 2009 i.e. about 210,000 people will fall into
poverty. The majority of this impact is expected to be in the rural areas. The expected decrease
in remittances of 25-50 percent could increase poverty by 2 to 4 percentage points (Box 1). In
other words, the fall in remittances will comprise 1/3 to 1/2 of the overall impact of the crisis on
poverty. Only by 2012 is the level of poverty in Moldova expected to return to pre-crisis levels.

   111.    THE GOVERNMENT'S STABILIZATION AND ECONOMIC
          RECOVERY PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES
30. In October 2009 the new Government immediately launched their "Economic
Stabilization and Recovery Plan for 2009-2011". The Plan includes a sequence of measures
which aim to; (a) cut inefficient and low-priority public spending; (b) help businesses to
withstand the economic slow-down and emerge less burdened by public administrative
requirements; (c) protect vulnerable households from a drop in consumption due to the
recession and fiscal contraction. The three priorities on which the Plan is built are; (i)
Stabilization and streamlining of public finance; (ii) Economic recovery; and (iii) Securing an
                                                          ih
efficient and fair social protection. In consultation w t the IMF, Government corrected the
2009 Budget in early December. The macro program agreed with the IMF focuses primarily
upon fiscal policy measures to reverse the fiscal deterioration which occurred in 2008-2009 and
to restore the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level by 2012. Fiscal measures in the macro program
are fully consistent with policy recommendations from the World Bank's Public Expenditure
Review, The dialogue under this DPL is therefore strongly linked to pillars (ii) and (iii) of the
Government's Plan.
                  A.              AND
                       STABILIZATION STREAMLINING PUBLIC FINANCE
                                               OF

3 1. The Government's stabilization pillar hinges on correcting a sizeable fiscal
imbalance, whilst protecting public investment and social spending. The aim under the IMF
program is to gradually bring the deficit down to 2 percent of GDP by 2012. However, sizeable
correction has been achieved both prior to and under the IMF program agreed in January 2010.
Relative to a counterfactual of unchanged policies in 2009 and 2010 which would have allowed
the deficit to reach almost 14 percent of forecast GDP, fiscal measures adopted by Government
(excluding new budget support grants) narrowed the deficit by some 5.8 percentage points of
estimated GDP in 2010 (Table 5). With an increase in budget support grants, this left the IMF's
projected fiscal correction by end-2010 at an impressive 7 percentage points of GDP, but it still
left a deficit estimated at 6.8 percentage points of GDP. The IMF program target for 201 1 is 5
percent of GDP - a further correction of 2 percentage points of GDP. Preliminary figures for
end-2009 and the first quarter of 2010 suggest the Government may in fact exceed this fiscal
correction.

32. The Government plan also recognizes key fiscal challenges of a structural nature
that must be tackled in the medium term to restore fiscal sustainability. These involve
broadening the tax system to avoid excess reliance on border taxes and VAT on imports,
shifting expenditures in line with Moldova's aging population, and freeing up `fiscal space' for
infrastructure maintenance. Others relate to re-orienting public spending in support of economic
recovery and social protection. The Government's fiscal corrections will target a reduction in
public employment, starting in the 201 1 budget with a reform of educational institutions. The
World Bank contributed extensively to both the short-term fiscal corrections and the
Government's medium term structural agenda for fiscal correction through the "Policy Notes"
publication and through several background papers prepared under the 2009/10 Public
Expenditure Review which were shared with Government and the IMF team.

challenging: in the coming years, Moldova needs to close schools, retire teachers and
consolidate the school system. Student numbers are declining. There were 26 percent fewer
students in 2007/08 compared to 2002/03. By 2014 there will be yet 15,000 fewer students. This
combines with high numbers of poorly paid teaching and non-teaching staff to make the school
system inefficient. The pupil teacher ratio is very low, averaging 13 pupils per teacher in 2007-
08 compared to 18 on average in Europe. In addition, 37 percent of school employees are not
teachers. Running schools is costly; most have excess space but insufficient non-salary budgets
to stock and maintain the space they use. Some schools need to close, but since most of these
are rural, school 'optimization' cannot happen without safe transportation to neighboring
villages. Significant numbers of teachers could be retired under this process, but this would
affect Government's pension liabilities. The overall pension system does not yet create a
disproportionate fiscal burden in Moldova, but this is partly because pension replacement rates
are the lowest in Europe (at 27.4 percent of gross wage and 35.1 percent of net wages).
Collection and compliance rates for pensions are low. The Bank is assisting the authorities to
evaluate experience with piloting school optimization in two Districts, with a view to rolling out
the program more broadly.

34. Through the 2010 Budget, Government is taking short-term measures for fiscal
correction whilst improving the quality of spending on programs to support economic
recovery and social protection. Road maintenance received a sizeable increase compared with
the approved Budget for 2009. Overall funding in the Budget for agricultural subsidies was
reduced, with inefficient and inequitable subsidies on VAT inputs and outputs being abolished.
An increased share of the new agriculture subsidy budget now supports investment (although in
2010 Government must first clear unpaid subsidies due in 2009). The Budget includes measures
to increase funding and improve the eligibility formula for targeted social assistance, whilst
freezing levels and entrants for other nominal assistance schemes without a break in benefits. At
the end of December 2009, Government reconstituted a newly independent energy regulator
(ANRE) whose first new task was to set the heating tariff for the 2010 heating season at a rate
which would cover operating costs. The 2010 Budget also provides for an increase in overall


                                                         16
    public capital investment spending by 26 percent over 2009. Along with supplementary
    financing for the World Bank-supported Social Investment Fund (SIF), this should allow an
    increase in job-creating small scale capital works and road projects, although challenges remain
    over how to ensure this budgetary increase is effectively used.

    35. The stabilization program allows for monetary easing during 2010, and strengthens
    financial sector monitoring and the framework for bank resolutions. With headline
.   inflation at -1 -6 percent year-on-year, well below the National Bank's target, and with monetary
    policy being increasingly focused on managing inflation instead of exchange rate stability, the
    authorities have decided to ease monetary policy during the start of 2010. This measure along
    with a clear re-statement of monetary policy objectives by the National Bank of Moldova is
    expected to help bring down the very high risk premium reflected in commercial bank lending
    rates and interest rate spreads. The banking sector's capital-asset ratios remain safely above the
    statutory ratio of 12 percent. To ensure continued stability in the banking sector, the National
    Bank of Moldova is conducting monthly stress tests and has initiated an independent diagnostic
    study of bank portfolios. The National Bank is amending the legal framework to allow it to
    intervene in problem Bank's after the failure of one bank (Invesprivatbank) in June 2009.

                                                  RECOVERY
                                        B. ECONOMIC

    36. The Government's economic recovery program presents a credible and extensive
    list of long-awaited reforms to stimulate domestic and foreign investment and to increase
    Moldova's exports. Implementation has started strongly, with many reforms to simplify,
    liberalize and de-regulate business already having already been implemented. These reforms
    recognize that the past model of remittance-funded and consumption-led economic growth in
    Moldova is not sustainable, and that fbture growth requires improved productivity, export
    competitiveness and investment. Government also recognizes that in the absence of a significant
    fiscal or monetary policy stimulus, Moldova needs to stimulate private investment and exports
    to shorten the recession and kick-start the economy. Since Moldova is a much more heavily
    regulated economy than many of its competitors, there is substantial scope to provide a stimulus
    through policy reforms. Despite the impact of the global downturn on their export markets,
    existing Moldovan businesses - and especially exporters         -  can achieve significant cost
    improvements through Government implementing basic market liberalization, and through
    easing the administrative burden on firms from Government regulations, licensing, certification
    and reporting procedures. This is why the recovery component of the Plan (and the Action Plan
    for excluding administrative constraints to the business environment see Annex 4) identifies an
    extensive list of short-term actions to liberate businesses from public controls (Annex 4 . Over
                                                                                             )
    time, reforms in the recovery plan to improve the efficiency of energy and telecommunications
    sectors, to make markets more competitive and imported goods cheaper, and measures to
    improve the competitiveness of the banking sector will add to these more direct measures to
    make Moldova a lower cost economy for exporters and private investors.

    37. To lay foundations for foreign direct investment and domestic investment,
    Government is looking to improve the regulatory environment in the energy sector.
    Government established an independent regulator (ANRE) to regulate tariffs at commercial
    rates (which addresses quasi fiscal costs). This is seen as key to fiscal sustainability in the
    medium term. It is also a first step in potentially attracting private investment in the energy
    sector, where there is interest from private companies in electricity generation. The World Bank


                                                   17
staff is discussing options for a debt work-out for the gas company Moldovagaz and the heating
distributor Termocom as part of a plan to restructure the energy sector and attract much needed
investment. Private operators have already expressed an interest in purchasing the assets of
such a merged company. Together with better regulation of the sector and better energy
efficiency use through ratification and implementation of the new energy efficiency law, these
measures should improve the efficiency and quality of the energy sector. In the
telecommunications sector, private telecommunications companies have now connected their
fiber optic networks directly to Romania and thence the EU. The Government has removed
policy constraints, and has issued directives to allow this investment to proceed. It is now
working to simplify the approvals process to enable future cross-border connections. This has
ended the de facto monopoly of state telephone company Moldtelecom on external
communications, which led to market inefficiencies. The measure, when combined with the
telecommunications regulator ANRCETI's moves to strengthen competition regulation in the
sector, should help lower costly external communications, and improve the quality and Internet
access. Not only would this reduce costs for existing export businesses, but it should also
stimulate the expansion and opening up of new ICT businesses, including service exporters.

38. To stimulate exports, Government has first targeted the wine industry. Wine has
long been Moldova's main export. The sector has strong potential in traditional CIS markets as
well as new EU markets, and can have strong multiplier effects through rural Moldova, so long
as the policy environment improves. Government has therefore taken steps to remove barriers to
exports, simplify the certification procedure, and cut the number and cost of certification
procedures for wine exports, whether in the form of bulk wine, bottled wine, or grapes and
vines.
                            AN        AND
                  C. ENSURING EFFICIENT FAIR     PROTECTION
                                            SOCIAL

39. The ESRP aims to support vulnerable groups through more efficient channeling of
social assistance and through promoting social inclusion. Immediate actions under this
social protection component of the Government's program aim to: (i) prevent unpredictable
pension reappraisals based upon monthly payment increases, (ii) implement measures to remove
monopolies in the provision of socially sensitive products, (iii) monitor the prices and market
conditions of "goods of social importance", (iv) start up projects from external credits for social
infrastructure rehabilitation, (v) increase the tax allowance for dependents to ease the burden on
large families, and (vi) increase monthly allowances for child care.

40.    Expand targeted social assistance. To improve the targeting of the social care system
for disadvantaged families based on means-testing, Government intends to gradually replace the
nominative compensation system and scale up targeted social assistance. In the 2010 Budget,
Government announced that they would freeze rates of nominative compensation rates and
prevent new entrants to nominative compensation schemes, starting on 1 January 2010. To
make the means tested scheme more attractive to new applicants, Government increased under
the 2010 Budget, the guaranteed minimum income under the scheme from 430 to 530 Lei per
month. For the 2010 heating season, Government has also provided and additional flat rate
compensation for heating tariff increases of Lei 130 through the targeted scheme.

41. Expand coverage of social insurance. Under the ESRP, the Government intends to
improve the fairness and coverage of social insurance for poor people. Measures include;
extending the obligation to pay for mandatory social insurance to all workers in Moldova;


                                               18
removing pension benefits for wealthy individuals who retain the position that made them
wealthy in the first place; unifying retirement age and the way pensions are calculated for all
groups of pensioners; and reviewing the feasibility of modernizing to a two-tier pension system
comprising a base and insured pension. The ESRP also announced measures to improve the
coverage and affordability of the mandatory healthcare insurance, to encourage public private
partnerships in health service provision, and to extend the availability of `compensated'
medicines to include children under 14.

42. Help the unemployed and returning migrants to find work and re-train. Another
component of the ESRP on social protection aims to better inform the population about labor
market demand and supply, including for migrants getting back home after having lost their jobs
abroad. Immediate actions include scaling up retraining courses for the unemployed and for
returning emigrants and setting up (with Bank support under the SIF) short-term public works.
Medium term actions aim to expand unemployment benefits to include agricultural workers and
migrants.

Participatory Process

43. The new Government immediately consulted the public about the severity of the
crisis and corrective measures needed within days of taking office. Before announcing their
intention to negotiate a reform program with the IFIs and seek loan financing, the Prime
Minister, Minister of Economy, and Minister of Finance each briefed the public at press
conferences on the severity of the fiscal situation, the impact of the crisis on economic growth
and the balance of payments, and on the need for corrective policy measures.

44. The Bank also consulted widely on recommendations made in the AAA which
supported the design of this operation. A joint press conference was held between
Government and the World Bank and IMF to discuss the "Policy Notes" publication and the
measures within them being recommended by the international community. These notes were
posted on websites and widely discussed by chat groups on the World Bank Country Office's
popular Facebook page.

45. Government then led participatory consultations on the measures supported by the
DPL under the ESRP.. The Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan was developed by a
preparation committee made up of members of trade unions, private sector groups, and a
number of NGOs, civil society leaders and international development agencies. Their views
were incorporated in the design of the Plan through the committee's working group meetings
and wider consultations. The preparation of the document was led by the Deputy Prime-
Minister, Minister of Economy Valeriu Lazar and developed by the Committee following
extensive participatory discussions between sector ministries, their stakeholders, and Moldova's
development partners. For the first time in Moldova's history a full day retreat bringing together
the entire Cabinet, the press, the EU, IFIs and development partners consulted on the country's
crisis response and post-crisis economic growth solutions.

46. At each stage of policy implementation under the DPL, Government has held press
conferences to explain the measures being taken. Early in 2010 a Government Decision on
transparency established a participatory committee comprising a council of NGO
representatives with specific terms of reference to consult on all policies at planning,
implementation and evaluation stages. In the case of the most controversial measure -

                                               19
increasing heating tariffs, Government worked with focus groups headed by the Mayor of
Chisinau to design compensating measures that would quickly reach the most vulnerable
groups. The Minister of Social Protection conducted widespread publicity campaign to raise
awareness and enrollment in the new targeted social assistance program, and to explain the
reforms to nominative compensation. Press conferences were held to announce the agriculture
subsidy reforms, and the granting o f permits to private telecommunications companies to cross
the Romanian border with fiber optic links. The Parliamentary working committee on the
budget and economy widely discussed reforms to business registration in early readings of the
amendments, and with the help of investor groups revised the amendments to further reduce
rent-seeking possibilities.

      IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
                     A. LINK THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
                            TO

47.    The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY09 - FY12 aimed to assist in laying
the foundations for inclusive economic growth by addressing three interrelated challenges
closely-linked to the objectives of the Government of Moldova's National Development
Strategy (NDS)for 2008 - 2011. These are: (i) improving economic competitiveness to
support sustainable economic growth; (ii) minimizing social and environmental risks, building
human capital, and promoting inclusion; and (iii) improving public sector governance. DPL
support in the areas of agriculture and energy (see policy matrix) are based on technical
assistance (TA) activities to assist the government in defining and developing its reform
program in these sectors, as set out in Pillar I - "Competitive Market Environment, Stability,
and Pro-poor Growth", of objectives of the CPS.

48. At least one single-tranche budget-support operation within the period was
envisaged to support economic recovery. In addition to these broad objectives, the CPS
which was prepared at the onset of the crisis and political uncertainty, emphasized the need for
flexibility in the lending program of US$45 - $50 million per annum during FY09 - FY12
(depending on IDA'S performance-based allocation system) in response to the impact of the
global financial crisis and political uncertainty. With IDA commitments in FY09 backloaded,
IDA has been positioned to respond strongly to assist the authorities in mitigating the impact of
the crisis in FY 10, with overall IDA commitments, including the present DPO in FY 10 reaching
U S 6 9 million.

Link to the Objectives of the Crisis Response Window

49. The case for using Crisis Response Window (CRW) resources to finance this
operation is strong. The different components of the program aim for Moldova to stabilize
the economy cushion the impact on the poor and stimulate recovery. These objectives are
consistent with those of the Pilot Crisis Response Window, in particular with the aim to provide
financial assistance to protect core spending to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis.
As described in Part I1 of this document, severe compression of aggregate demand though
declining remittances and exports has led to a major loss of welfare, reflected in rising poverty
in Moldova. The strong transmission of the crisis to Moldova's fiscal balance has opened the
fiscal deficit which - even under a well-financed IMF program - can only be closed through
structural measures in the medium term. To prevent excessive compression of public investment
and non-salary expenditures which could prolong the crisis and damage public services,

budgetary support is needed in the short-term. Whereas the Bank has front-loaded IDA to
respond to the crisis, the provision of CRW resources for Moldova will limit the extent to which
the Bank needs to postpone previously planned and much needed IDA-financed investment
projects.
                   B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
50. The IMF and World Bank maintain close collaboration in Moldova. In October the
IMF, World Bank and UNDP presented recommendations to the Government on the pillars of a
first draft ESRP at a Cabinet Retreat which was attended by all heads of embassies and
development agencies. The Bank has assisted the Fund staff in the design of fiscal stabilization
measures through the 2010 PER. The Bank staff also collaborated closely with the Fund on
energy sector reforms under this operation.

5 1. Moldova receives developmental funding from several multilateral and bilateral
donors and collaboration with the Bank is growing. The Policy Notes that supported the
DPL operation's .dialogue with the Moldovan government were developed jointly with the UN,
the IMF, the EU, DFID, and SIDA. The Bank's team worked closely with the IMF on issues
related to short-term fiscal adjustments in the macroeconomic framework. Policy measures
under this proposed operation complement the IMF's structural reform agenda in the Extended
Credit Facility and the Extended Fund Facility Arrangements initiated in October 2009.

52. Complementing the IMF and Bank operations, the EU is providing budget support
of EUR 50 million to contribute to the sustainable economic development of rural areas, as
envisaged under the EU-Moldova Action Plan. The EU's operation supports priority areas
under the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2008 - 201 1, and the new government's Anti-
Crisis Plan (2009 - 201 1) - (i) enhancing competitiveness, and (ii) regional development, and
(iii) gender issues (in conjunction with Swedish SIDA). It will cover policy issues, institutional
development, stimulation of business development, regional development, and improvement of
public finance management (PFM). On the PFM part, IMF and Bank assessments of their
respective operations will be used for performance monitoring and criteria for disbursement.

53. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), USAID, SIDA, and DFID provide
lending and technical assistance operations in infrastructural development and social
protection. The MCC signed a US$ 262 million Compact with the Moldovan government in
January 2010. The Compact focuses on irrigation sector reform, the reconstruction of irrigation
systems, access to agricultural finance, as well as the rehabilitation of a section of the country's
national road network. The DPO's policy action on the road sector and those of the MCC's road
rehabilitation project are similar. This DPO operation builds upon DFID's proposed reforms in
the government's Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program.

54. The EU and the World Bank organized a Consultative Group meeting on Moldova
jointly on March 24 in Brussels. The meeting reinforced donors' overall commitment to
support Moldova's socio-economic development anchored on a strategy of integration and
harmonization with the EU. The Government's strategic framework and request for donor
assistance is summarized in a short programmatic document, Rethink Moldova. The
Consultative Group meeting raised a total of US$ 2.6 billion in support for the implementation
of this strategy over the period 2010- 13.



                                                21
                                     C. LESSONS
                                              LEARNED
5 5 . The formulation of this policy-based operation draws lessons from the preceding PRSCs
and earlier policy operations in Moldova, as well as from extensive policy dialogue and analysis
in preparation of the policy notes for the new Government. The choice of instrument and
balance of responsibilities between the IMF and World Bank programs were informed by
experience through the ECA region with crisis response, and through sustained collaboration
and dialogue between the Bank and the Fund.

56.    The following lessons were applied to this operation:

       Policy based loans are useful in crisis response. Previous crises have shown that the
       impact on poor people can be severe or lasting if the response to crisis results in over-
       compression of the Government's fiscal position and hence to pro-poor public services or
       growth-enhancing infrastructure. Thus, policy based loans, a fast-disbursing instrument,
       with appropriately designed prior actions can respond effectively to finance a country's
       fiscal gap.

   a   Good public expenditure and Jiscal analysis was critical for designing the crisis
       response. The public expenditure analysis, as summarized in the Policy Notes, was
       critical in the crisis response operations of the World Bank and the IMF. Given the
       relative timing of Fund and Bank programs and the effectiveness of collaboration
       between the two agencies on Moldova, IMF support focused on the stabilization pillar of
       the ESRP and the Bank was able to focus its fiscal prior actions on the quality of the
       fiscal adjustment, concentrating on priorities for economic recovery and social protection,
       and to focus on the structural agenda for economic recovery. The World Bank team was
       actively involved in early discussions with the IMF on priorities for fiscal tightening with
       the Government and the IMF. The fiscal actions for the Fund program were entirely
       consistent with the findings of the Bank's public expenditure review work, as noted
       above.

       Government ownership of the policy agenda is key and it is best established through
       extensive engagement and dialogue. This single tranche operation is fully aligned with
       the Government's Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan which in turn was heavily
       influenced by technical consultations between the Bank and the new Government on the
       Bank's "Policy Notes" publication. More importantly, the Government achieved
       ownership of the program within the Alliance and with broader civil society through
       intense consultations. Government also presented the Plan at a joint
       Government`Development partner Retreat in October 2009.

       Public sector reforms and institutional reforms take time, and are dijjJicult to achieve
       across-the-board. The experience of PRSCs underscored for Moldova the findings of the
       IEG public sector evaluation. Centrally driven public sector reforms in Moldova may
       have generated a substantial understanding of the weaknesses of the public sector, but
       without yet having a major impact on conditions of service for public sector workers or -
       most importantly - the size and efficiency of the public sector. Furthermore the change in
       administration, political uncertainty and the onset of the crisis mean that the time is not
       right to press for rapid implementation of public sector reforms.


                                                22
             An up to date stock of quality analytic work is an essential underpinning for policy-
             support loans. Over the past 5 years the Bank has prepared two multi sector public
             expenditure reviews (PERs), an agriculture PER, a comprehensive DTIS , two FSAPs,
             two PEFA studies, and Institutional and Governance Review, and a Country Economic
             Memorandum. This equipped the Bank with a good stock of current knowledge of the
             constraints to trade, growth and service delivery in Moldova. It helped the Bank to advise
             the previous Government over several years, and when the new Government came to
             power, the Bank was ready to respond with comprehensive advice.

                            V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION
                                      A.           DESCRIPTION
                                           OPERATION

  58. The objectives of the proposed operation are to support the Government's efforts to
  adequately fund priority expenditures for economic recovery and social protection during
  fiscal correction, while laying the foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery through
  exports and private investment. The World Bank has provided technical inputs and advice to
  the Government in the design of structural macro fiscal measures5. In the face of corrections and
  contractions in public spending, Moldova does not have scope for a fiscal stimulus. The private
  sector therefore needs to be unleashed from over-regulation, limiting restrictions, and unfair
  competition. This operation helps to lay foundations for a private sector-led recovery.

  59. The proposed Development Policy Operation (DPO) is a single operation of $25
  million (SDR 16.6 million equivalent, including SDR 7.4 million in Pilot CRW Resources).
  It helps the new Government to implement reform measures whilst meeting a dramatically
  increased financing gap in the aftermath of the effects of the global crisis. It does so during a
  period of continued political uncertainty, with another round of general elections likely in the
  second half of 2010. The single operation is therefore designed as a bridge to a medium term
  program of annual support which could be developed once political uncertainty abates. This
  section therefore sets out both the details of the short-term program measure-by-measure, and


  World Bank (2009); `Moldova: Policy notes for the New Government', and World Bank (2010) forthcoming
 "Moldova: 2009 Public Expenditure Review".

outlines future medium term priorities in each area for in the form of challenges. The medium
term agenda will be discussed in future dialogue.

60. The IMF is supporting fiscal correction measures under the stabilization pillar of
the Government?sEconomic Stabilization and Recovery Plan. The Fund-supported program
includes several high priority fiscal measures (set out in Table 5 ) which were set out in the joint
World Bank and development partner publication ?Policy Notes for the Government?. On the
expenditure side these include; (a) postponing and reducing wage increases, freezing hiring and
eliminating 4,000 staff positions, (b) cutting goods and services expenditures by 20 percent
whilst protecting high priority sectors, and (c) reducing the value of recurrent agriculture
subsidies.

61. Bank support under this operation complements the Fund-supported program by
focusing on the quality of adjustment in 2010 and upon structural measures to accelerate
economic recovery. Emphasis is placed on measures in the Government?s Economic
Stabilization and Recovery Plan which should; (i) re-prioritize public spending to support
economic recovery into the medium term and better target social assistance to the poorest and
most vulnerable in the short term; (ii) lay the policy and institutional foundations for investment
and productivity in telecommunications and energy sectors, (iii) remove restrictions which
deflate farm gate prices, depress productivity and restrict trade in wine and grape products, thus
depressing the rural economy; (iv) reduce bureaucratic red tape in Moldova to reduce the
overheads faced by businesses and in dealing with the Government.

62. Measures under this operation closely complement the stabilization and
streamlining of Public Finance component of the ESRP. This operation proposes to support
measures in two broad areas:

   I, Adequately fund priority expenditures in the budget during f i c a l correction, in
         particular;

               i. better maintain roads;
              ii. redirect agriculture support towards investment and;
             iii. better target social assistance to protect the poorest Moldovans.
   II. Lay foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery in exports and investment.

 I.       Adequately Fund Priority Expenditure in the 2010 Budget during Fiscal Correction

A. Better maintained roads

63. A key challenge facing Moldova is to adequately maintain its existing road network,
which for the population and land area is regarded as a broadly adequate network. The
network is in bad shape, the legacy of at least a decade and a half of under-funded routine and
periodic maintenance. About 58 percent of the national roads and 75 percent of local roads are
classified as in poor condition. Only 10 percent of national and 5 percent of local roads are in
good condition. An urgent effort is needed to save what's left of the road network and,
eventually, rehabilitate the rest. The road maintenance budget during 2009 was again well
below the minimum requirement to avoid further depreciation. The reform of road maintenance
financing and a large increase in funding for road maintenance have been conditions for road
investment financing by external partners for some time. PRSCs 1 and 2 sought increases in the
roads maintenance budget. The cancelled PRSC3 planned to do so also. The DPO program
therefore maintains this measure as a prior action.

64.       Consistent with the road sector discussions, thepriur action is:

      0   Adequate provision for road maintenance made in 20 10 Budget.

65. Road sector discussions between Government and development partners agreed that an
overall amount of MDL 582.9 million should be allocated for road maintenance in 2010,
compared with MDL 242 million in 2009. The figure of MDL 582.9 million is deemed
adequate by the Bank for 2010. Of which: (i) MDL 448.9 million should be for routine and
winter maintenance on public roads, and (ii) MDL 134 million should be for public road capital
repair works. On December 29*, 2009, the 2010 Budget approved by Parliament became
effective. The overall amount for road maintenance to be transferred to the Road Fund was
agreed in Law 138 dated December 29, 2009 which proposes that 50 percent of excise duty be
used for road maintenance. Government Decision number 300 of April 21" 2010 established a
Steering Committee of the Road Fund, and another Government Decision (to be passed) will set
out how the road maintenance budget will be disaggregated by the Ministry of Transportation.

66. In the medium-term, Government intends to provide an annual road maintenance
budget at an amount equivalent to a higher share of excise tax on fuels. Government's
commitment to increase road maintenance spending will not only protect Moldova's transport
network from further depreciation, it should also provide a welcome boost to demand for labor
on maintenance contracts during the recession.

B. Reduce inefficient agricultural subsidies.

67. Agriculture should be an engine of growth in Moldova, but between 2003 and 2008
it contributed very little to value added growth, which was driven entirely by growth in
services. Key challenges facing agriculture in Moldova have been poor price incentives for
outputs and inputs use, poor access to markets, unpredictable policies and regulations,
inadequate food safety standards, and inequitable and inefficient public spending - most of it
through recurrent subsidies. The largest and, economically, the least rational agriculture
subsidies were those that reimbursed all farmers for VAT paid on fertilizers and pesticides, and
those that reimbursed some farmers (those above the VAT turnover threshold) for VAT they


                                                26
charged on their outputs. Both were recurrent subsidies. Both have benefited larger commercial
farms, and may have encouraged them to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides. In fact recurrent
subsidies constituted 45% of total subsidies in 2008. These subsidies distort input and output
prices and so interfere with market equilibrium. In 2008, only 7.8% of recurrent subsidies went
to small and medium-scale farmers, the so-called "individual farmers". In contrast, in 2009,
23.6% of all investment subsidies went to individual farmers. In the 2010 Budget through Law
number 137, Government reduced total subsidies for agriculture by 6 percent. Within this
overall reduction, the World Bank has supported the protection of investment support -
recommending that recurrent subsidies be cut. In line with this advice, Government abolished
the VAT reimbursement subsidies for inputs and outputs f o 2010, and will reallocate these
                                                              rm
resources towards investment subsidies. In addition, they plan to introduce a cap on public
support for each farm in order to increase the share of the support going to smaller farms.

68.       Theprior action supported under this operation is:

      0   Redirect the subsidy scheme to increase support for investment while reducing recurrent
          subsidies by approving a Government Decision on the 2010 Regulation of the Use of
          Agricultural Support `Fund Resources.

69.                                                                                 ,
                                                                                    '
          This prior action was met through Government Decision number 167 of March 9 2010.

70. In the medium term structural reforms and public investments are needed to
improve productivity and efficiency. These should remove monopsonies in the purchase of
outputs, liberalize the use of EU seeds and seedlings, enhance the quality of food products for
export, reform research and agricultural education, build suitable irrigation systems and cold
storage facilities, and improve the overall investment climate for agri-business. However, in
order to free up resources for a more positive role for public investments in the agriculture
sector, and to create a level-playing field between commercial and individual farms, it is first
necessary to redirect a declining budget for agriculture towards supporting investment. The
chosen prior action is therefore a politically challenging strong first step in the direction of
medium term sector reform. World Bank technical assistance is already supporting reform of
the research institutions and the Bank is discussing with the Government on other partners how
best to support a paying agency for agriculture subsidies, and how to help improve food safety.

C. Better targeted social assistance.

7 1. Moldova's key challenge in social assistance during this recession and economic
reform program is how to protect poor people by better targeting an adequate macro level
of social assistance spending to reach poor families. Until recently, Moldova has relied
exclusively on numerous categorical benefits as the main instrument in its social safety net. In
2008, total expenditure on social assistance benefits was approximately 2.7% of GDP, on par
with spending as a share of GDP in OECD countries and higher than the ECA average of 1.6%.
In terms of targeting accuracy and cost-effectiveness in addressing poverty, Moldova's social
safety net (SSN) ranks among the worst in the Eastern European and Former Soviet Union.
About 28% of overall social assistance spending in Moldova is estimated to reach the poorest
20% of the population. The Government's policy priority is therefore not to increase such
spending under the 2010 Budget, but to improve its targeting. The largest social benejt is
compensation for utilities payments, which represents about 40% of the total expenditure on


                                                27
SSN. This is followed by a number of different child benefits (which sum to 20%), then war
veterans allowances, Chernobyl allowances, compensation for disabilities, then other numerous
and small benefits to different categories considered to be deserving of social support.

72. In mid-2008, Moldova developed and launched a new "Targeted Social Assistance
Program" (TSA) that verifies eligibility based on income and proxy-means. The program is
being scaled up. Eligibility and the amount of the benefit are contingent on an income gap
between a household monthly income and the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) that is set
each year in the State Budget law. Since actual income can be under-reported by households, a
proxy score has been added to the formula to exclude non-poor households and reduce errors of
inclusion of the non-poor. However, in 2009, the proxies were changed by Parliament through
changes in the regulation determining the formula and benefit administration, distorting the
intended targeting results of the new formula. Partial and preliminary data for 2009 shows that
80% of households pass the proxy test irrespective of their income, and 90% of households that
pass the income test also pass the proxy test. So the current proxy test does not add significant
gains in accuracy to the targeting mechanism. Implementation results for 2009 point to
problems in the formula and administration that the new Government is willing, and planning,
to improve. Government has worked with DFID consultants to restore the formula and improve
it, so the new Government resolution # 167 contains all the necessary improvements.

73.    In 2010, the Government of Moldova suggested further improving the new
program; increasing funding by 74 percent, while down-scaling categorical benefits,
starting with a freeze in utilities payments and integrating the means-tested child benefit
into the new TSA6. This operation proposes to support these changes by supporting the
adoption of 3 Government resolutions, one for each program as prior actions for the operation.

74.    The proposed prior actions are:

       Improve targeting accuracy of new TSA and increase its coverage of the extremely poor
       by adopting a Government resolution which: (a) revises proxies system to improve
       targeting; (b) Ignores cadastre income when household is exclusively elderly, disabled or
       children, (c) Reintroduces income `disregard' in calculation of the household's monthly
       income of applicants. This prior action was met in full on February 2"d 2010, through
       Government Decision number 37.

   0   Prevent Nominative Compensation from expanding at cost of the new social assistance
       scheme: (a) Freeze the level of Nominative Compensation for utilities for current
       beneficiaries and allowing no new beneficiaries, and (b) Abolish through a Government
       Decision the child allowance with a threshold of 54 lei and integrating it with the TSA.
       This prior action was completed on December, 29th 2009 through the passage of Law
       number 135 and Government Decision number 19 of January 19,2010.

75.    The medium term reform agenda includes consolidation of the remaining multiple
small benefits to the groups of beneficiaries, and downscaling categorical benefits while
extending the Targeted Social Assistance. This gradual approach to consolidating benefits
into the TSA program and downsizing categorical schemes is needed for political-feasibility.
However, savings generated by downscaling old programs would come at a slower pace than

Means-tested child benefit in Moldova is a small allowance. The larger universal child benefit will not be affected.


                                                       28
the needs for TSA expansion. The Government and the World Bank staff are discussing how to
build on these initial crucial steps to expand the targeted assistance scheme.

 11.      Lay foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery in exports and investment

Remove trade restrictions to raise the profitability of traditional exports and rural product
markets.

76. In the absence of fiscal space for a public investment stimulus, Moldova faces a
serious challenge of how to stimulate the economy into recovery in the face of recession
amongst trading partners. On the export side there seems to be scope to undo export
restrictions and regulations to give a boost to exports in the short-term. As a result of several ad
hoc export bans over the past years, output for a number of products in Moldova has suffered
from low farm-gate prices compared with those in neighboring countries. Low profitability in
the agriculture sector has led to out-migration from rural areas, mainly to other countries as
other domestic sectors have had little capacity to absorb excess rural labor. With the out-
migration of labor, increased labor productivity has compensated somewhat for the decreased
labor input. However, real prices for farm products have tended to fall by more than the
increases in productivity, and despite input subsidies, farm input prices are rising much faster
than output prices, so farm incomes have been squeezed in real terms. Household survey data
suggest that many small farms are loss-makers, and that over time a higher proportion of poor
people in Moldova are farmers. Instead, remittances have functioned as a complementary
income support. With lower labor demand from abroad leading to slower migration under the
global recession, increasing the profitability of agricultural activities and thus increasing rural
labor demand in Moldova's recovery will protect rural households from falling firther into
poverty.
                  Box 3: Agriculture's Importance for Recovery in Moldova


       Agriculture in Moldova remains an important contributor to the wider economy. About a third
       (31.1%) of Moldova's labor force is still engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing; more
       than industry ( 12%, which includes agro-processing industries), trade, hotels and restaurants
       (17%). Agricultural and Food exports account for 37.4% of total exports. Until 2007 Moldova
       was one of the few CIS countries with positive net exports in food products. This compares
       with net exports at -51.0% for total goods, and -62.1% for non-agricultural trade in 2008).
       Hence a short-term strategy for Moldova to boost private sector activity through policy reform
       by necessity needs to involve agriculture. Despite a decline over the past years as a share of
       total current price GDP (reaching an all-time low of 9.8% in 2008), primary agriculture still
       accounts for about 22% of GDP in constant prices. Such a relative decline in the real prices of
       agricultural products would be good news for Moldova if it had been driven by commensurate
       gains in land and labor productivity - because farm incomes would be increasing and the food
       share of households' consumption would be falling. However, the decline in real farm gate
       prices since 2003 has been more rapid than the rise in productivity. Export bans, export
       restrictions and regulations have driven declines in farm-gate prices - by forcing farmers to
       sell their produce domestically. So too have monopsony purchases in many product markets,
       some designed to keep urban food prices low, others seemingly designed to subsidize food
       processors. Wholesale reform is needed to liberalize agricultural product markets.




                                                     29
    77. The wine sector has traditionally been the main contributor to agro-based exports
    from Moldova, with an estimated 70,000 producers, most of them smallholder farmers. In
    addition there are around 15,000 individuals involved in wine processing. Wine accounted for
    12 percent of total exports and 33 percent of agro-food exports in 2008. As a result of both
    internal and external trade restrictions, grape and wine output prices and exports decreased
    significantly since 2006'. This not only affected the rural economy, but Moldova's total exports.
    Liberalizing the trade of grapes and alcoholic beverages would simultaneously raise Moldova's
    overall exports and inject a boost to rural incomes. Actions included under the program are a
    first step to doing away with formal trade restrictions and to support the recovery of one of
    Moldova's important industries.

    78.       The proposedprior action is:

          0   Liberalize wine exports by: (a) abolishing restrictions on the exports of bulk wine, grapes
              for wine, and distilled wine, (b) eliminating certification for each shipment of wine, (c)
              eliminating state trademarks on alcoholic products for export, (d) dissolving the
              independent agency Moldova Vin, and delegating its functions to the Ministry of
              Agriculture and Food Industries. This prior action was completed with the passage of
              Law 31 on October 7*, 2009, and amendments to Law 91 on trademarks, and
              Government Decisions numbers 597 of October 21Stand 793 of December 2nd,2009.

    79. In the medium term, Moldova needs to develop an export oriented agriculture and agri-
    business growth strategy. Though labor productivity in agriculture rose, the land productivity of
    Moldovan agriculture and crop yields remain low compared to other European countries,
    resulting in low incomes and under-investment. Transport costs are high. Crop prices in
    Moldova remain systematically low compared to trends on world markets and levels in
    neighboring countries, and have fallen steadily relative to the GDP deflator since 2000. Agro-
    food exports are growing faster than agricultural GDP value added, while agro-food imports
    have grown faster and now exceed exports in US dollars. Limited access to high quality inputs
,   (in the form of seeds and seedlings) has contributed to low productivity. Actions under the
    Government's program therefore aim at decreasing input prices and facilitating exports,
    especially to the EU. Food safety standards in Moldova are well below EU market entry
    standards, providing a barrier to exports. The medium term policy agenda that the Bank will
    pursue with Government will therefore includes measures to; facilitate trade in higher value
    export products for the EU market, to provide farmers with better access to price information
    and better access to new seed varieties, to reform food safety institutions, and to reform research
    and agricultural education institutions and programs. Since efficient land utilization is an
    important determinant of farm profitability, the team will also review how well the rural land
    market is functioning. Finally, the World Bank Group will help export facilitation through the
    on-going Competiveness Enhancement Project and through advisory services on the "doing
    business" agenda, and in follow-up to the DTIS.

    More commercially viable energy sector

        80. A key challenge to macro/fiscal sustainability has been the build-up of arrears in the
        heating company. The District Heating and Gas sector in Moldova is in a dire situation, which
    7
     The farm-gate price of technical grapes in 2009 was 1.5-2.0 leiikg, compared to 2.8-3.6 leikg in 2006.
    The volume of bulk wine exports in 2009 was just 3,719 thou dal, down from 10,193 thou dal in 2006.


                                                            30
 has been building up for more than a decade. On the instructions of the municipal council,
 Termocom, the District Heating Company (DH) in Chisinau has been charging heating tariffs
 below-cost. Termocom is consequently bankrupt, and has been under insolvency proceedings
 since 2001. In turn, Termocom has been supplementing its shortfall in revenue by non-payment
 to its heat suppliers - the Combined Heat and Power plants (CHPs). The CHPs in turn pass on
 the financial burden as non-payment to Moldovagaz for the gas they use. They also cross
 subsidize some of their losses on heating by hiking up the price of electricity. Accumulated
 arrears to Molodvagaz have now reached close to MDL 1.8 billion. The arrears led to a
 temporary cut off of gas supply in winter 2008, and is now a threatening not only the energy
 supply security of Moldova, but the welfare of vulnerable population in Chisinau, who are
 dependent on DH system for heating during the harsh winter season.

8 1. Higher electricity tariffs have knock-on effects on Moldova's export
competitiveness, especially in energy intensive industry, and in particular in the promising
ICT sector. Moldova's electricity market is small, preventing economies of scale in the sector
and limiting the attractiveness of private electricity providers. Progress towards efficient pricing
in electricity therefore also requires that Moldova resolves the losses made by Termocom. The
shift to more commercial tariffs needs to be accompanied by investments in energy efficiency
energy savings and development of renewable energy sources. To provide incentives and other
measures to facilitate investments in energy efficiency, Government developed an energy
efficiency law.

 82. The prior actions to improve the commercial viability of the energy sector whilst
 compensating poor people are:

   0    Submit to Parliament the Energy Efficiency Law.
This prior action was met through the Government Decision number 306 dated April 23,20 10.

   0   ANRE ensures district heating tariff for Chisinau at a level high enough to allow
       Termocom to be current on its payables while implementing capital programs
       submitted in its tariff calculation.

This prior action was met on January 14' 2010 through ANRE Decision number 364 after
ANRE had been granted tariff setting authority through Law number 107 of December 17th
2009.

   0   Government approves the Law for Social Compensations for the Cold Period of the
       Year 2010 to protect poor people from higher heating prices,

This prior action was met on March 5*, 2010 through Government Resolution number 162,
following passage by Parliament of Law number 15 on February 26th2010.

83. The medium term priority is to restructure the energy sector to maintain financial
sustainability and facilitate investments. For over a decade Termocom has been unable to
work itself out of bankruptcy. Private investors have signaled that only after a comprehensive
corporate restructuring for both Termocom and CHPs will they consider investing in either the
heating or the electricity sector in Moldova. The World Bank is therefore providing advice to
Government on options for developing a comprehensive restructuring plan. The plan, starting in


                                               31
2010 aims to: (a) Ensure cost recovery tariff by transferring district heating tariff setting
authority to ANRE (prior action); (b) restructure the energy sector in Chisinau during 2010 to
address corporate governance and clear the debt to Moldovagaz by adopting proposed measures
which could include:

   0   Valuing gas pipelines built by the state and owned by Districts;
   0   Preparing a sector reform program which will cover debt restructuring and corporate
       restructuring in the energy sector;
   0   As part of this sector reform program, the Bank team has suggested considering the
       merger of Termocom and CHPs - before the next heating season - through a debt-to-
       equity swap to address the debt stock between them, the inefficiency of the generation
       and distribution system, and corporate governance;
   0   Approving the Energy Efficiency Law and an Energy Efficiency Action Plan to reduce
       inefficiencies and cushion the impact of higher tariffs;
   0   Preparing a program to protect the vulnerable population from the increase in tariffs; and
   e   Preparing an investment plan to increase the efficiency of the integrated energy system in
       Chisinau, which could potentially be supported by World Bank and other international
       organizations.

84. Although policy discussions on restructuring are still at the stage of considering
options, much of the technical work needed to inform the choice of options has begun. In
addition to supporting the development of such a plan, the World Bank is providing technical
assistance with energy efficiency policy, and an assessment of the investments requirements of
the state-owned CHPs to improve the efficiency of energy supply.

Lower barriers to private investment in telecoms

85. The ICT sector probably has the most potential to quickly attract new private
investments. Telecommunications and Internet investments could also stimulate economic
recovery through productivity gains from product innovation and service exports, where
emerging Moldovan business services potentially provide a low-cost alternative for European
out-sourcing businesses looking to cut costs. A key challenge for Government policy is that
current regulatory imbalances make the telecommunications sector in Moldova a drag on the
economy when it should be an engine of growth. Adequate supply of international connectivity
is essential to support growth in service exports, to reduce the price of international calls to and
from Moldovan migrants, to bring down the cost of remitting, and to spur Internet use in
Moldova. However, although Moldova's international segment is on paper liberalized, private
licensed telecommunications firms face numerous administrative barriers and are prevented
from installing cross-border cables for their voice and Internet services.

 86. Government has indicated that three licensed electronic communications service
 providers are ready to connect their fiber-optic networks across the border to Romania.
 Government has committed to issuing a clear set of instructions to the relevant authorities
 confirming the legal right of these operators to build such cross-border networks. The Minister
 of ITC issued a public statement to this effect, indicating that the telecommunications sector
 will be hlly "de-monopolized". This operation therefore proposes to de-monopolize cross-
 border fiber optic cable access.



                                                32
87. The pre-existing procedure for approving permits was arduous and bureaucratic
and resulted in no permits being granted to private providers. Under existing rules,
licensed electronic communications service providers (ECSP) first approach ANRCETI and six
other agencies (including Ministry of Environment, Customs, Border Security, and local
authorities) individually for permission to access the border and initiate construction of the
cross-border cable facility. Then, upon approval of the request, the ECSP begins construction of
the cable facility, connecting it with the other operator. On completion of construction, the
ECSP seeks inspection of the facilities individually from ANRCETI and the five agencies
(without local authorities) also individually so as to approve its operation. After clearance and
approval by the other agencies, ANRCETI would provide a final clearance to the ECSP to begin
operation of this facility.

 88.   For this operation the prior action is:

       De-monopolize cross-border fiber optic cable access, by: (i) Issuance of a Government
       letter to MTIC and a letter from MTIC to ANRCETI providing formal confirmation of
       the legal rights of all licensed electronic communications service providers (ECSPs) to
       construct and operate cross-border telecommunications cable facilities; (b) ANRCETI
       sending an approval letter to at least one ECSP's request to construct and operate a cross-
       border telecommunications cable facility from a permitted ECSP.

These prior actions were met in full by the end of April 2010. On January 29th Government
wrote to MTIC, and of February 22"d MTIC's wrote to ANRCETI providing formal confirmation
of the legal rights of all licensed electronic communications service providers (ECSPs) to
construct and operate cross-border telecommunications cable facilities. Government has since
issued licenses to two of the three licensed ECSP applicants, whereas only one permit was
expected to be issued at the time of pre-appraisal. On March 17" the Prime Minister formally
requested that the Minister for ICT simplify current procedures, and on March 22"d the Ministry
committed in writing to do so.

89. Government is committed to important short and medium term measures to
stimulate competitiveness and private investment in the sector, bring down international
call rates, and move tariffs closer to costs. The short-term measures include the submission
by MITC and ANRCETI to Government amendments to the Government Resolution No. 974
dated August 12 2008 to simplify the procedures through which ECSPs may apply for and
receive approvals to construct and commission cross-border telecommunications cable facilities
in the future through a simple, transparent, and time-bound process. In the medium term,
measures include implementation of a comprehensive tariff rebalancing program to eliminate
internal cross-subsidies within Moldtelecom, and issuing further licenses for next generation
broadband wireless services (e.g. WiMAX or LTE). These measures will further develop a level
playing field in the ICT sector. The next specific step in policy reform after private cross-border
cable links are built is to prepare regulations for the bulk resale of international bandwidth.
Beyond this, the capacity of the sector regulator (ANRCETI) needs to be built to ensure
regulations are reliably enforced. These areas will be discussed as possible follow-up actions
under a subsequent development policy operation. Meanwhile the World Bank and EBRD will
collaborate in supporting competition and expanding access to international connectivity in the
coming years, with the Bank providing technical assistance and financial support through the e-
Moldova project, which is currently in preparation.


                                                 33
Reduced red tape

90. To develop a more internationally competitive and export-led economy,
Government faces key challenges of de-monopolizing the domestic suppij and demand o       f
strategic goods and services and reducing bureaucracy. Moldova has implemented two
stages of business regulatory reforms since 2004. These reduced the time spent by Moldova's
business managers on regulatory compliance by 25%. The Doing Business 2010 Report
recorded Moldova among the top 10 reformers worldwide. Still, there is plenty of scope to
further improve Moldova's relative business environment.

91.    The prior action to reduce red tape is:

       Approve and submit to Parliament amendments to the law on State Registration of
       Companies (Law 220 of November 19,2007 to enable the Chamber of State Registration to
       become a one-stop-shop for registration for health, statistical and social insurance
       purposes (CNAM, BNS, and CNAS).

 92. This action would substantially reduce the time and costs of business registration
 during recession. It could be an important measure to attract small and medium enterprises -
 who are most likely to recover first from the recession - into the formal sector.
The prior action was met through Government Decision number 282 of April 15* approved the
amended law, which was submitted to Parliament April 20th.

 93. The Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan sets out an impressive list of short
 and medium term measures to make Moldova a more competitive, lower cost economy.
 More recently the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published a detailed and ambitious Draft
 Action Plan of some 59 short and medium-term measures to eliminate administrative
 constraints. This is to form a Government order signed by the Deputy Prime Minister. The
 World Bank Group is supporting the Ministry of economy with advisory services through FIAS
 to assess what it would take to reduce the costs of doing business, and to implement the
 necessary actions. Meanwhile IDA'S recently extended Competitiveness Enhancement Program
 supports these and other measures designed to improve the investment climate.

Links to the preceding PRSC Series

 94.     Whereas the global crisis has changed the context and urgency of policy actions,
 this operation maintains some of the momentum and extends some of the policy areas
 supported under the preceding PRSC series. It narrows down the coverage of the PRSC
 series to focus on areas most relevant to the Government's response to the global crisis. It opens
 support to new areas on trade liberalization and telecommunications, designed to provide a
 growth stimulus to the private sector. The operation has achieved a missed 2009 trigger on road
 maintenance which was proposed at identification stage under the cancelled PRSC3. By
 changing the Regulation on Agricultural Support Fund resources, it has solidified the intended
 reforms under PRSC 1 to shift subsidies towards investment and create a level playing field
 between individual and large commercial farms. Similarly, the measure on targeting social
 assistance under this operation has fine-tuned regulations for implementation of the Law on
 Targeted Social Assistance which were being discussed under the PRSC. In energy, the
 operation supports two components of the energy strategy that was developed as a prior action



                                                 34
for PRSC2; (i) set energy tariffs at cost recovery, and (ii) develop incentives and other measures
to promote and facilitate energy efficiency. This is a change in direction from what was
proposed under the PRSC series which was focused instead on cross-border trade management,
power system balancing, and gradual power market opening. The actions to reduce red tape in
the business climate under this operation also mark a shift from the focus on competition laws
under the PRSCs. The competition agenda was postponed, but is on Government's list of
measures for implementation later this year. The main departure from the PRSC under this
operation is that it has dropped the longer-term agenda of public sector reform, which is on hold
in Moldova whilst Government focuses on fiscal stability. In addition, it focuses - through
telecommunications and wine liberalization - on generating a short-term growth stimulus.

                               B. OPERATION
                                          IMPLEMENTATION

95. Supervision of the program will be aligned with the existing government-led
monitoring and evaluation system for the ESRP and the Moldova-EU Action Plan. The
Interministerial Committee for Strategic Planning will be responsible for monitoring the
program and all benchmark and outcome indicators. The specific benchmarks and outcomes to
be monitored have been drawn from the Government's overall development program, thus
providing significant benefits in reducing transaction costs for the Government. The overall
reform effort will be reviewed by the Government in close coordination with regular multi-
donor missions to ensure continued implementation of the program within an adequate
macroeconomic policy framework. Given satisfactory progress, Moldova's reform program will
be supported by subsequent development policy operations under a programmatic lending
framework, subject to the approval of the Board of Executive Directors.

                               c.   POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

96. Prior to the crisis, in 2008, poverty was most common amongst rural Moldovan
households, those headed by retired persons, farmers, those with limited schooling, and
those with 3 or more children (Figure 15). Poverty was significantly lower in households
receiving remittances, although these same households share many of the other characteristics
of poor households; they tend to be rural, headed by elderly people, and they tend to be farmers.
Analysis of household data on small farm incomes and costs suggests that farm households with
remittance income tend to be those most commonly making losses from farming activities. For
this reason, those receiving remittances, particularly remittance-receiving farm households,
should be included amongst the most vulnerable to the crisis, because remittances into Moldova
fell by around one third in 2009. We estimate that the fall in remittances alone could have
forced as many as 3 percent of Moldovans into poverty.




                                               35
                      Figure 15: Who Were the Poor in Moldova in 2008?




97. This profile of the poverty impact and vulnerability to the crisis in Moldova steered
the inclusion of prior actions under this operation. Emphasis is placed on measures to
stimulate small farmers' incomes whilst boosting exports. Household survey data show 2008
grape sales provided 20 percent of sales income for the smallest 5 deciles of farms by land size,
whilst wine provided a further 7 percent. The shares for small farmers in general are slightly
lower (Figure 16). This result holds on a regional level too. Household data suggest that small
farmers in the Southern wine growing regions had the lowest returns from farming since 2006,
when grape and wine prices were driven down by the bulk wine buying restrictions and trade
restrictions - restrictions that are now being lifted.

           Figure 16: Structure of Small Farmers' Incomes in Moldova in 2008




                              22.6%                      8.0%




                                              36
Impact of the Program

98. Better targeted social assistance is a pro-poor action. Bank staff simulations using
household data suggest that the proposed measure to improve the targeting accuracy of social
assistance in 2010 should increase the proportion of Moldova's expenditures on social care
going to the poorest quintile from 28 percent to 32 percent. This target is derived from the
additional 40,000 households enrolled in the TSA scheme by the end of 2010. Since data on
what constitutes `32% of the lowest quintile' is contingent upon the number of additional
households and will not be available until mid-201 1, it is agreed to use the additional 40,000
households as the indicative measure. Better targeting also mitigates the poverty impact of
macroeconomic shocks more broadly. Moldova operates a number of different types of child
benefits which account for 20% of the social safety net. The majority of these are universal, but
their overall targeting accuracy is relatively high. This stems from the high correlation between
the presence of children in the household, and poverty. For this reason, this operation does not
suggest either a freeze or abolition of categorical child benefits. On the contrary, the team
suggested indexing these child benefits for inflation. The child benefit which is being abolished
under this operation is means tested and is much less significant, totaling 0.1 percent or even
less of GDP. It is for Lei 50 per family for any family whose monthly income falls below Lei
54 per month. There are very few such households receiving this small amount. By
comparison, the income threshold for targeted social assistance is 530 lei, and the average
benefit is 600 lei. A recent study of performance in 2009 showed that the targeted scheme has
successfully targeted poor recipients of previous social protection programs. The net income
effect of expanding coverage and benefits under the targeted social assistance whilst abolishing
the Lei 54 child allowance will be positive for the recipients of the old targeted child allowance

99. The removal of VAT subsidies on outputs and inputs, with the subsidy being
transferred for investment by individual farmers is also pro-poor. In the 2010 Budget,
VAT at 8 percent on agricultural products replaced VAT at 20 percent. Therefore the VAT
inclusive price of farm products produced by those within the tax net should decline. More
importantly, the subsidy on outputs was only given to farmers with an annual turnover above
the VAT threshold. So it was provided exclusively to more wealthy farmers, not to smaller
farmers. Smaller farmers who are out of the VAT net received no output subsidy. Whereas they
pay VAT on fertilizer and pesticide (the two inputs on which the VAT input subsidy was paid)
they use a lot less pesticide and fertilizer than larger farmers, who also received the input
subsidy. Small farmers can pass the VAT paid on fertilizer and pesticide to consumers in
slightly higher prices (these inputs are small compared to their value added). The elimination of
both subsidies will mean a net loss in fiscal transfers received by relatively wealthy farmers.
That some of this reduction is to be used to support farm investments through a scheme with
much better targeting to smaller individual farmers makes the action pro-poor.

100. Increased road maintenance is neutral in its poverty and social impact. Much
depends upon which roads are maintained with the increase in the maintenance budget. Rural
roads are certainly in worse shape, and are important for prosperity in rural areas where almost
three quarters of poor people live. However, prioritization on the basis of traffic counts would
tend to focus funding on the main trunk roads around cities and towns.

101. Liberalization of grapes and wine exports is expected to benefit the rural economy,
where Moldova's poorest and most vulnerable people live. Stimulating traditional exports in
the wine industry is expected to increase employment and wages in the sector and demand for

                                              37
wine grapes, which should help offset a decline in demand for rural services caused by the
crisis. Under the 2004 DTIS, the Bank staff estimated that a 6 percent increase in export prices
in Moldova (of which grapes and grape products are significant) generates average gains in the
order of 5 percent in household expenditure. The analysis of household data referred to in
paragraph 97 shows that grapes and wine remain important income earners, especially for
smaller farmers.

102. The prior action on raising heating tariffs was accompanied by better
implementation of targeted subsidies to compensate vulnerable households in Chisinau
(see Annex 6 . In January 2010, the regulator, ANRE recommended an average 29 percent
               )
tariff increase for heating tariffs in the capital city of Chisinau. To offset the negative poverty
and social impact of increased heating tariffs this winter, Government introduced a temporary
Law for Social Compensations for the Cold Period of the Year 2010 which was approved by
Government on March 3th, 2010 (G.R. No.162, 5/03/2010).The monthly amount of the
compensation under this law is 130 lei, which will be provided to three groups. These are; (a)
beneficiaries who are entitled to the targeted social assistance - around 40,000 families
estimated to be entitled this past winter (152,000 individuals); b) Public sector employees
receiving pay in the lowest 7 public pay scales (scale I to VII) - 67,700 individuals; c)
pensioners and social allowances beneficiaries (+ 65 years) who receive less than 700 lei per
month - a total of 115,582persons. The World Bank provided analysis of the impact of higher
energy prices on poor households (see Annex 6) and the Bank's social protection team assisted
Government to design the compensation scheme.

103. The other prior actions on business environment and telecoms are not expected to
have a negative or direct effect on poor people.

                                               ASPECTS
                                 D. ENVIRONMENTAL

104. Heating tariffs at cost-recovery levels and the passage of the energy efficiency law
are expected to have strong positive environmental effects. The removal of implicit
subsidies on the price of heating in Chisinau should increase incentives for loss reduction and
when coupled with the update to the Energy Efficiency Law, will make it simpler for utilities
and economic agents to become more energy efficient. Together these measures should improve
air quality and reduce green house gas emissions in Moldova.

105. Conducting road maintenance activities, if poorly implemented may have
environmental effects. Generally road maintenance activities will not generate any major
environmental impacts. Most will be temporary and local, and will cause only minor, localized
and short-term negative effects, being linked with works such as leveling, grading, potholes
patching, cracks priming, surfacing, quarrying, use of hazardous materials, such as combustive-
lubricating ones, bitumen, etc. These impacts are common in road maintenance works and can
be mitigated by existing management techniques. Maintenance activities will also have positive
indirect impacts on human welfare, safety, health and socio-economic environment through
reduced vehicles operating cost, decreased number of accidents; reduced air pollution resulted
from vehicles emissions on rehabilitated road sections; better access to settlements and markets,
development of new business opportunities, etc. The ongoing WB "Road Sector Program
Support Project" is helping to ensure that there are no significant environmental effects from the
road rehabilitation program. The project Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SER) stipulates
all environmental protection requirements for both rehabilitation and maintenance phases.

                                                38
Furthermore it is specified these requirements should be included in technical specifications for
contractors. Supervision and monitoring of environmental performance of these activities will
be carried out on the site by the SRA environmental specialist.

106. Expansion of wine exports may also have negative effects for Moldova's
environment by increasing pesticide use on vineyards and by generating larger amount of
wastes associated with wine processing. A number of ongoing projects financed by the World
                       1
Bank (RISP; RISP 1 ; GEF POPS Project) have been designed to mitigate the effects of
increased agricultural activity on the environment. For example, among the components of the
Bank's "Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) Stockpiles Management and Destruction Project"
are those aimed at institutional strengthening, the modernization of current legislation (Le.,
those related to the Stockholm Convention), and the introduction of broader chemical safety
approach in the country consistent with European Union legislation. The project also has a
special activity under "Prevention of new Stockpiles of Obsolete Pesticides" that aims to
provide support in promoting best practices in Pest Management in crop production, including
Integrated Pest Management. The wine industry also may pose some environmental risks, in
particular by generating ferrocyanide wastes which are the result of clarification and
stabilization of wines. In Moldova currently there are few thousand metric tons of such wastes
stored at different wineries. In recent years Moldovan environmental authorities made good
progress in disposing them, using a special technology designed by specialists from the
Moldova Technical University, Thus the amount of ferrocyanide wastes was reduced by more
than 50 % (from about 7,000 metric tons). Disposal is carried out at one of the largest wineries
"Vismos". It is imperative that this work be continued to keep newly generated wastes under
control, minimizing their potential environmental impacts.

107. The abolition of VAT subsidies on fertilizer and pesticide inputs could offset
negative effects by bringing better relative pricing of inputs in agriculture. This should
reduce relative under-pricing and inefficient use of fertilizers and pesticides. The net effect on
the environment from actions taken to support agriculture under this program could in fact be
positive.

108. Telecoms, business environment and social assistance measures supported under
this program are unlikely to have any effects on the environment.


     VI.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION
                                    A, FIDUCIARY
                                               ASPECTS

109. Public Financial Management (PFM)). The crisis has confirmed that Moldova's system
remains vulnerable to macro-fiscal and political shocks and requires further strengthening. The
priority reform areas include: (i) improving public resource allocation by introducing modern
budget preparation practices; (ii) strengthening financial discipline by modernizing the treasury
system and budget execution procedures; (iii) improving public debt management to minimize
debt service costs; (iv) improving fiscal administration and increasing the effectiveness of
financial controls; (v) increasing the efficiency of budget management through introduction of
an integrated financial management information system; and (vi) harmonizing the budget and
fiscal legal fiamework with European Union standards. As noted in the 2006 and 2008 PFM
assessments based on PEFA methodology, the weaknesses in the current PFM system in


                                               39
Moldova are mainly due to institutional capacity issues typical for a country in transition.
Progress achieved in the main areas of PFM reforms and the remaining weaknesses are
summarized below.

110. Budgeting. The Government has been consolidating budget formulation and increasing
the policy focus of the budgets. The main remaining weaknesses in budgeting include failure to
adhere to the budget calendar, and the soft link between the budget and sector policy priorities.
Last year `revealed vulnerability to in-year electioneering and macro-fiscal shocks. Deviations
between the approved and executed budgets increased in 2009, and preparation of 2010 budget
could not follow the regular budget calendar. Efforts to better link policy priorities with the
budget at a sector level are underway, with DFID support. Strengthening budget formulation is
also a component of the PFM project which is under implementation.

111. Internal controls over budget execution. Moldova has made important progress in
developing the national treasury system. Controls over budget execution have been significantly
strengthened through gradual expansion of treasury coverage that started in 1997. Significant
improvements were made in the last years in functioning of the treasury single account, cash
management and forecasting. However, the outcomes of 2009 budget execution confirm that the
budget execution procedures are not yet robust enough to assure stable execution of the budget
under unfavorable revenue. Accumulation of new expenditure arrears could not be fully
prevented in 2009 and the practice of cash rationing - abandoned for many years - had to be re-
introduced. Weaknesses in treasury operations are largely being addressed under the PFM
project through developing improved budget execution procedures and creation of a
comprehensive FMIS expected to become operational in 20 12.

112. Procurement. Overall, the public procurement system is favorable and challenges
include improving implementation of procurement legislation and strengthening institutional
arrangements. The practice of single source tendering has been significantly reduced while the
percentage of contracts awarded using an open tender procedure has increased. A new public
procurement law, which entered into force in October 2007, has largely brought Moldova
legislation in line with international good practices. The remaining legal weaknesses relate to
inadequate institutional arrangements for complaints resolution. The new Government
implemented important changes to strengthen control over public procurement through
reorganizing the Agency for Material Reserves, Public Procurement and Humanitarian aid and
establishing the Public Procurement Agency in subordination of the Ministry of Finance. The
Regulations on the organization and functions of the Public Procurement Agency and its
structure have already been approved. It is expected that with this change the operational links
between the procurement and budget execution processes will be strengthened. The Bank
completed a draft Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) at the end of April 2010
through close coordination with the Government, and will develop an action plan to improve the
shortcomings of the system over the summer of 2010.

113. Accounting and reporting. Under the PFM project, the Government is preparing for
important changes in public sector accounting and reporting. The new integrated budget
classification and chart of accounts system is being developed on the basis of the GFS2001
standards to be launched with the new FMIS. It is expected that in the medium-term the
Government will maintain cash-based accounting for the treasury and modified cash based
accounting for the budget institutions. The new FMIS will enable the Government to produce



                                               40
consolidated financial statements showing financial position of the Government, and not only
the budget execution reports, as is the practice at the moment.

114. Internal auditing. Internal audit in Government is still at an early stage of development.
Small internal audit units have been established in the Ministry of Finance (MOF), State Tax
Service, Customs and National Social Insurance House. In addition, there is a Control and
Revision Service (CRS) under the Ministry of Finance. In most cases, the CRS is performing
ex-post verification of budget execution. Development of a modem internal audit function
within the Government is a component of the PFM project. The goal of the reform is to
establish Public Internal Financial Control system (PIFC) based on EU model across the budget
entities.

115. External auditing. The Court of Accounts aims to develop into a modern external audit
institution and has made important steps in that direction over the last few years. A new Law on
the Court of Accounts was approved in late 2008, but its implementation and the introduction of
modem audit practices remain challenging. Until recently, parliamentary oversight remained
weak as there was very little follow up on the Court of Accounts' findings. The recently elected
Parliament has taken a more proactive stance and has indicated an intention to establish a closer
collaboration with the Court of Accounts through its Economy and Budget Committee. Further
capacity building for application of the modem audit and techniques is also required. Technical
assistance is being provided by the Swedish and British national audit offices, as well as a
recipient executed multi-donor trust b d managed by the Bank, to support the implementation
of the COA's Strategic Development Plan.

1 16. Reforms to strengthen the public financial managementframework. Weaknesses in the
Moldovan public financial management system are well understood and a broad PFM reform
program has started. As a result of these efforts, the credibility of the Moldova PFM framework
has been enhanced, as evidenced by improvement of PEFA scores between 2006 and 2008.
Major assistance is already being provided by the Bank under the PFM Project, co-financed by
SIDA and the Dutch Government. The project is supporting improvements in: (i) budget
preparation and execution; (ii) accounting and reporting; (iii) development of FMIS and cash
management; (iv) internal auditing; and, (v) PFM related training. TA for the Court of Accounts
is under implementation and the dialogue on procurement reform agenda is ongoing. The
existing instruments already mobilized through a concerted multi-donor effort appear to be
sufficient to support the critical PFM agenda. The fiduciary risk for the present DPO is therefore
regarded as acceptable.

 117. Central Bank and Foreign Exchange Management. The IMF updated its safeguards
assessment of the NBM in 2006 and found that while the NBM has made progress in
strengthening its safeguards framework, certain weaknesses remain. To further improve the
NBM's safeguards, the updated assessment recommended: (i) the IMF program data
compilation procedures be formalized delineating responsibilities of the involved departments,
and the Internal Audit Department should include regular audits of the process in its audit plans;
and (ii) the NBM Law be amended to better align profit distribution rules with recapitalization
requirements, and formalize the financial relationship between the NBM and the Ministry of
Finance. NBM financial statements have received unqualified (clean) audit opinions from
external auditors (Ernst & Young) for the past three years (2006, 2007 and 2008). In view of
this, there are no additional fiduciary safeguards considered necessary as far as management of
the foreign exchange is concerned.

                                      B. DISBURSEMENTS
118. Disbursement and Fundsflow. The proposed Credit, SDR 16.6 million (US$25 million
equivalent), will follow the Bank?s disbursement procedures for development policy lending.
The Credit will be disbursed in one tranche immediately upon effectiveness and is not tied to
any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. The funds.wil1 be
deposited at the existing treasury USD account used for held by Ministry of Finance/State
Treasury with the NBM. The proceeds of the funds will be used for domestic budget
expenditures or for repayment of foreign debt. If the Association determines at any time that an
amount of the Financing was used to make a payment for an Excluded Expenditure, the
Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Association, refund an amount equal to the
amount of such payment to the Association. Amounts refunded to the Association upon such
request shall be cancelled.

119. Accounts and Auditing. The administration and accounting of the Credit proceeds will
be the responsibility of the State Treasury of the Ministry of Finance. The standard country
rules will be followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The Government will
maintain accounts and records, or ensure that such items are maintained in accordance with
existing Government system for budgetary spending. The MOF will be responsible for the DPO
administration and for preparing the withdrawal application. The DPO will be subject to
ratification by Parliament before it becomes effective. The MOF, with the assistance of the
NBM, will maintain records of all transactions under the DPO in accordance with sound
accounting practices. Within 30 days of the NBM being credited, the MOF will provide to the
Bank a confirmation that the amount of the DPO has been credited to an account that is
available to finance budgeted expenditures.

                                C.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

120. This proposed operation faces a number of risks, given continued political
uncertainty and Moldova?s inherent vulnerability to external shocks. The main risks that
could subsequently jeopardize achievement of the intended development results include: (i)
political economy risks, especially the fiscal risks which stem from these; (ii) external shocks to
economic growth; and (iii) financial sector risks. The macroeconomic implications of (i) and (ii)
                          1
are discussed in section 1 .

121. Political economy andfiscal risk. Unless there is a change to the Constitution (which
now seems unlikely), a third round of Parliamentary elections will have to be undertaken before
Spring of 201 1. In advance of these elections, it will be politically difficult for Government to
get started on civil service reform, school consolidation and pension reform. Given sensitivity
and complexity of school reforms on the scale needed to restore structural sustainability to
Moldova?s fiscal policy in the medium-term, it is unlikely these can be implemented in the
short-term. This creates risks for the 2011 Budget. The World Bank staff is working with
Government to develop a feasible path of school reforms, and to identify alternative cost-saving
measures in the budget. Similarly, heating price increases have proven politically challenging to
the Government, especially in the capital of Chisinau. Further increases will be needed in fiture
to avoid Termocom running up new arrears with gas suppliers, and increasing contingent
liabilities for the Government during the 2010-1 1 winter season. Should elections be held in the
Spring of 201 1, further reform in the energy sector prior to the heating season would be
unlikely, and either arrears or contingent liabilities could re-emerge.


                                               42
122. Reversibility of Policy Actions. There remains a risk that some measures (for instance in
agriculture and deregulation) may be reversed, or that the pace of reform could slow down
should there be another change in Government after repeat elections. To mitigate such risk,
some measures were selected for inclusion under this operation because in addition to bolstering
recovery, they are populist and therefore less reversible. For instance de-monopolizing cross
border fiber optic cable is already reported to have improved internet service speed and
reliability, and has reduced charges by Moldtelecom the previous state monopoly and led to the
announcement that tariff rebalancing is needed. The Bank is designing an eGovernment project
which will help deepen telecommunicationsreforms and support the reforms initiated under this
proposed operation. In the energy and agriculture sectors, the Bank is providing TA to support
the reform efforts with technical analysis and to widen the pro-reform coalitions. Nonetheless,
the interests and lobby groups that prevented reform in the past remain present and could regain
their strength should there by another change in Government.

123. External shocks and balance of payments risk. Moldova is vulnerable to external
market developments. On the import side, the price of natural gas imported in Moldova will
continue to rise to European levels over the next five years. Higher energy prices may have
significant poverty implications, with the burden of the price increase falling disproportionately
on the poor and on households with limited alternative sources of fuel. Regarding exports, any
tightening by Russia of license requirements for the export of wine and alcoholic beverages8
may widen the current account balance beyond the level presented in the medium term
prospects presented.

 124. Financial Sector Risk. The rapid deterioration of the quality of commercial banks' loan
portfolios has significantly curtailed the banking sector's appetite for risk. In spite of ample
liquidity, credit to the private sector - especially to vulnerable but growth-oriented SME and
informal sector has stalled. Real interest rates on loans have also risen sharply due to a
slowdown in inflation. Given the downward pressure on profitability, banks are less willing to
cut lending rates regardless of base rate cuts by the NBM hence the cost of lending is too high
prohibiting access to much-needed credit for firms. A survey of the business environment
reveals that access to finance is a major obstacle to firms' growth in Moldova. To ensure the
success of the government's stabilization plan and to foster economic growth, the extension of
credit to private sector firms must resume promptly, especially to the key export and SME
sector. Policy measures to stimulate bank lending need to be introduced concurrently with the
implementation of the reform agenda. To mitigate financial sector risks, the Bank team has in
parallel with this operation helped continue dialogue with Government on measures to reduce
the risk of capital volatility in the banking sector, and to improve exporters' access to credit
under the foreign exchange law. These mitigating measures are likely to be adopted by the
Government. The IMF and US Treasury are also working with Government and the Bank to
strengthen the credit environment, bank supervision, non-performing asset management and
procedures for failed bank resolution.


125. Governance and publicfinancial management risks. Moldova remains a relatively poor
country with a commensurately limited administrative capacity. There remains a risk that
limited institutional capacity could hamper Government's ability to fully implement the 'actions
in the ESRP that support the objectives of this operation. Increased support for reform reflected

In 2006 Russia imposed a ban on Moldovan bulk wine exports.


                                                        43
by the international community at the recent Moldova Consultative Group Meeting in Brussels
should help to mitigate this risk, as donors commit additional technical assistance to Moldova.
It will be necessary to improve procurement to avoid a repeat of mis-procurement problems in
the roads sector. The fiduciary measures mentioned in section VI A above are designed to
mitigate PFM risks.

                          REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
              ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND RECOVERY PROGRAM
                                2009-2011

BACKGROUND

The economy of the Republic of Moldova is in deep crisis. The depth of the crisis is proven by
having basically all sectors of the economy stagnating, the aggregate demand for consumption
shrinking, following a drop of remittances, and an entailing decrease in foreign trade, combined
with a significant increase in the budget deficit. Economic shortages lead to even more social
tensions following people's undermined trust in the financial sustainability of the budget and
Government actions.

The crisis stems abroad - for a country vulnerable to external shocks, as is the case of Moldova,
the shrinking economies of the key partner states played a critical role which, starting in late
2008, triggered the reversal of economic development trends. At the same time, a delay in
implementing crisis control measures has deepened recession, yielding pessimistic forecasts in
the short and medium run.

The framework within which this Program is being carried out in the Republic of Moldova is an
extremely difficult and tension-prone one, as economic shortcomings impact the national public
budget which, in turn, can no longer act as an efficient and effective tool to support vulnerable
groups. Hence, people's vulnerability is directly proportional to economic stagnation and crisis
depth.

The ruling Government is aware of the depth of economic recession, as well as of how
vulnerable certain groups of people are to the adverse effects of crisis. Despite the worldwide
recession subsiding to the efforts bent by governments around the world, with some first signs
pointing out to the world's economy recovering in the second half of 2009, the beneficial impact
of these positive world trends upon the economy of the Republic of Moldova will show up later.
Under the given circumstance, the Government should undertake urgent steps towards stabilizing
and upturning the country's economy, in order to prevent the economic crisis from further
worsening in the Republic of Moldova.

Considering the sluggish model that the previous Government adopted for economy management
in general and for budget in particular, the ruling Government has limited leverage and little
room for maneuver today. Nevertheless, identifying the opportunities and the most efficient
intervention tools is a priority for the Government. Following the investments made, the
Government took a number of reform measures aiming at un-bureaucratizing and
demonopolizing the business environment, at improving the efficiency of public expenditure, and
at bettering the efficacy of public administration. This Program provides for an array of actions
to carry on the efforts that are already being implemented by the Government and which are to
be carried out starting with the fourth quarter of 2009 and running up until the end of 201 1.




                                               47
The tools that the Government is planning to make use of in order to stabilize and recover the
country's economy vary from measures aiming at stimulating consumption and economy to
measures meant to facilitate the access of business people to more affordable f h d s , and include
well-accepted measures along with less popular measures of reformative nature yet critical given
the current circumstances. The selection of these tools had a participatory approach, with the
support of the country's development partners, business environment representatives, academia
and civil society. In order to avoid the country's insolvency, the Government has to make sure
that the sparse budgets are adequately earmarked and channeled specifically towards the
vulnerable groups and towards working out the burning issues. Therefore, the Government will
make sure not only to push up the pace of economic recovery, but also to significantly increase
the budget support for vulnerable groups. Thus, regardless of the actions taken, it is a certainty
that the Government will start implementing the Program with strengthening public
administration and building efficient, sustainable and reliable state bodies.

The Government will bend efforts to find a socially acceptable tradeoff between sacrifices and
benefits, so that the burden of imperious reforms does not adversely impact upon those who
count on support or who are weakened, whereas those who incur loss today to be repaid in full
once the economy takes an upward-sloping trend. Therefore, all throughout the implementation
of the Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program, the Government relies, first and foremost,
upon its own efforts, but also relies on the understanding and trust of the whole society, along
with the support provided by the country's development partners, without the support of whom
the envisaged ambitious reforms would have not been possible. In the context of the dialogue
with the general public and aiming at ensuring the full understanding of the message
disseminated by this Program, the Government will develop a communication strategy
explaining in detail the need and impacts of actions included.

The receptivity of the whole society is critical to keeping up the European integratiofi agenda set
by the Government as a top priority in the context of its ruling agenda. The Economic
Stabilization and Recovery Program is not meant to substitute for the ongoing ruling agenda, the
National Development Strategy (NDS), European integration policy agenda or any other public
policy papers, but rather to complement those with concrete and specific actions, aiming at
reaching the goals set within the current strategic framework and in the context of crisis today.

SITUATION ANALYSIS

The current picture of the crisis is grim. Although the first signs of economic stagnation, which
stirred up countless controversial debates, showed up as early as in September-October of 2008,
the evolvement of the economy this year points out at deepening and ramified effects of the
crisis. In this vein, is the first half of year in 2009, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dropped
by 7.8 per cent as compared to the same time span last year, whereas the forecasts for the 2009
year-end were changed from negative 5 per cent to negative 9 percent. The shrinking overall
consumption demand, coupled with a decrease by over one-third in the amount of remittances
sent back home in the first seven months of the year, underpinned the economic stagnation that
has been built based upon an unsustainable growth model, which heavily relied on consumption
and imports and to a lesser extent was driven by investments and exports.




                                                48
The economic downturn was also driven by the involution of the industrial sector, wherein
outputs dropped by 24.3 pe cent during January-September 2009 as compared to the same period
of the previous year, primarily owing to decreasing outputs within the mining industry by 32.4
per cent and within the processing industry by 26.8 per cent. At the same time, although the
agricultural sector reported a better performance than that reported within the industry, and
agriculture outputs went down by 11.8 percent in January - September 2009, the harvesting of
agricultural crops in farms indicates a considerable decrease in the average amount of harvested
crops - by 38 per cent, and agricultural production still is mostly uncompetitive. A significant
decrease was reported in construction industry - a sector that shrank by some 33.7 per cent in the
first half of this year, but the sector reporting the most dramatic drop in outputs was the
transportation industry, where the total output of transported goods dropped by 59.2 per cent in
January - September 2009. When compared across other sectors, this industry was affected the
most by the crisis.

A 1.7-time increase in payroll arrears was reported during a cut by 34.5 per cent of remittances
sent back home during January-July, as compared to the same time interval last year, and amidst
growing fears of uncertainty about their future among population, leading to a 10.4 per cent
reduction of consumption in the first half of 2009. The shrinking overall demand for
consumption by 38.3 per cent during January-July resulted in a decrease of imports that enjoyed
an amazing high pace of growth over the last years, as well as a decrease by 24.2 per cent in
exports. The negative expectations of the economic development prospects in the short run also
led to fewer foreign direct investments (FDI). Thus, in the first half of 2009, the foreign direct
investments made within the national economy (net value) amounted to merely USD 34.6
million - an 8.9-time reduction as compared to the same time span during 2008.
The negative economic trends in the first 9 months of 2009 have also impacted upon the
consumer price index. Thus, since the beginning of the year, a slowdown in the pace of growth
of the key sectors of the economy resulted in a 2.9 per cent decrease in average consumer prices,
while in September the prices went up by 0.6 per cent as compared to August CPI. While
contributing to a raise in people's purchasing power in the short-term, deflation may have a long-
term negative effect on the country's economy in general and on businesses in particular.

The crisis has also affected the budget revenues, which dropped by 6.9 per cent during January-
August, causing an unprecedented budget deficit amounting to over MDL 2.5 billion. This
budget deficit is 8.6% greater than that incurred during the same period of 2008. The reduction
of revenues pouring into the national public budget was caused by a decrease in collected VAT
for imported goods and in taxes on foreign trade and on international operations. At the same
time, the increase in national public budget expenditures was owing to the former Government's
observance of its social obligations, which did not match the amount of funds available for
payout. Keeping its social payments up, coupled with a significant drop in budget revenues, has
resulted in an increase by 33.6 per cent of its internal state debt, as compared to 3 1 August 2008.
Its limited internal leverage to control crisis is further proven by a decrease by 26.6 per cent in its
official reserve assets during January-August this year, as compared to the same time span last
year.

The deepening crisis was accompanied by a growing reticence of the banking sector in granting
loans to the private sector. Thus, during the January-August interval in 2009, the amount of loans



                                                 49
granted within the economy dropped by 3.7 per cent, as compared to the same time interval last
year, and the amount of non-performing loans reached 12.8 per cent of total loans versus 5.9 per
cent at the year-end in 2008. The National Bank's decision to cut the basic rate from 12.5 per
cent to 5 per cent and the mandatory reserves for commercial banks from 17.5 per cent to 8 per
cent did not result in an expected drop in interest rates on loans for the time being. The interest
rate on loans granted in national currency dropped by about 5.2 percentage points, as compared
to August 2008, whereas the interest rate on loans given in foreign currency increased by 0.31
percentage points. The overall amount of deposits reported a more significant decrease than that
reported for loans - by 8.9 per cent, as compared to August 2008 versus an 8.6 per cent drop as
of the beginning of this year. The dropping number of deposits is indicative of slower regaining
of people's trust in the banking sector. The decrease of deposits in national currency is a key
factor in having a 7.6 per cent drop of its monetary pool (M3) during January-August, as
compared to the same time span last year.

The economic crisis that quickly took up the country's entire economy could not but exert
adverse effects on the population. During the January-August timeframe, the number of the
formerly reported unemployed increased 1.7 times, whereas 25.7 per cent fewer unemployed
managed to get a job, as compared to the last year. The upsurge of unemployment emphasizes a
problem not only in Moldova, but in other countries as well - where Moldovan migrants work -
with some of them having already come back home. This builds up the burden on both the state
budget (Le., more unemployed translates into more unemployment payments being made) and on
the real economy, unable to take up the unemployed, including those getting back home from
jobs abroad.

For the first time in the last three years there was an increase in the poverty level reported in the
Republic of Moldova in 2008. Hence, the absolute poverty rate increased by 0.6 percentage
points, as compared to 2007, whereas the extreme poverty rate went up by 0.4 percentage points.
These trends may as well continue down the road, as the policy impact upon consumption and
poverty is not felt right away.

GOVERNMENT VISION

Regaining people's trust in Government actions and in working and living opportunities in the
Republic of Moldova and bringing the country's economy back on trails to accomplish growth as
well as strengthening the premise for developing a steady economy are among the Government's
prerogatives in the context of this Program.

The actions to be implemented within the framework of the given Program aim to resuscitate the
economy, so as to accomplish upward trends within the country's economy already by 2010.
Economic recovery will come along with enlivenment of the investment process, including direct
foreign investments, an upsurge of outputs within industry, agriculture and services, revival of
foreign trade, waning budget deficit and a drop in unemployment.

The Program sets the foundation for the medium-term and long-term actions to underpin a
competitive economy, driven by knowledge, high technologies, free of any obstacles for growth
and prosperity and will back the setting up of a modern society, sharing contemporary values and




                                                 50
  upholding advanced living standards. The Government will strive for Republic of Moldova to
  become a country of law where the freedoms and rights of citizens are observed as well as
  ownership rights and the right to a decent living.

  PRIORITIES UNDER THE PROGRAM

 The Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program aims at three priorities, as follows:

  1, Stabilization and streamlining of public finance;

 2. Economic recovery; and

  3. Securing an efficient and fair social protection.

 The three priorities that the Government set to withstand the devastating effects of the economic
 crisis and to prevent an even worse financial and social crisis are cross linked. At the same time,
 the depth of crisis makes it necessary to implement certain "conflicting" actions - to widen the
 tax base in order to collect budget revenues and to cut down spending on certain non-priority
 sectors and less-vulnerable groups of population, as well as to take measures to ease the tax
 burden, stimulate economy and support those affected by crisis.

 One may not ensure a tradeoff between these burning yet somewhat competitive needs without
 securing a number of indispensable conditions. In this vein, the goals set within the above
 priorities may be reached only if the following preconditions are ensured: i) getting a stable
 political situation in the country; ii) donor support to finance the key projects and actions of
 major importance, for which there is no Government h d i n g available; and iii) Government and
 society partnership in accomplishing the above goals. Although the three above pre-conditions
 are equally important, the chance of fulfilling this ambitious yet much-needed Program will be
 close to none without having secured this partnership.

1 I.   Stabilization and streamlining:of nublic finance                                        I
 Economic stagnation and the shrinking foreign trade have led to eroding the tax base and, as
 such, to a considerable reduction of tax revenues. The dropping public revenues in 2009, coupled
 with huge social payouts, have inevitably resulted in growing budget deficit. Budget funds can
 no longer cover the current needs in terms of maintenance and social needs today, let alone the
 investment programs and structural reforms, which imply additional costs. Under this
 circumstance, should there be no actions taken to stabilize public finance, the budget deficit may
 go over 15 per cent of GDP. In order to prevent the Government from becoming insolvent, amid
 a growing vulnerability of the country's economy and population in general, the Government
 will have to streamline the budget spending, while at the same time widening the tax base and
 identifying sources from outside to temporarily finance the key important economic and social
 programs, as well as cover the budget deficit. Hence, the following objectives and short-term and
 medium-term actions are set within the context of public finance stabilization:

I 11. Economic Recovery
 The shrinking of aggregate demand for consumption, coupled with a growing administrative
 burden on business people, resulted in lower outputs of industrial goods, of services, especially
 within the transportation sector, of exports and demoralized the current and potential business
 people. The banking sector having reserve in granting loans to the private sector, as well as the
 still high interest rates on loans, make up another obstacle to starting up and carrying out
 business in Moldova. The economic growth in recent years, driven mostly by consumption and
 imports, is no longer feasible as an economic development model for the country, as it may no
 longer be secured, even more because of a significant drop of remittances starting this year. The
 economic crisis has once again proven that the current model of economic growth in the
 Republic of Moldova is not sustainable. Therefore, today the Government has the task not
 merely to safeguard those sectors and companies that have felt the devastating ripple effects of
 the crisis, but also to provide for the conditions that are adequate to operating and scaling up, as
 well as to the founding a new model of economic growth, based upon investments, enhanced
 productivity and higher competitiveness. In this context, the following objectives and actions
 have been set:

1 111.   Ensuring an efficient and fair social protection

 The economic crisis has had adverse effects not only on the country's economy, but also on the
 groups of people at risk even before the crisis hit, or who turned vulnerable once the recession
 stroke. The country's shrinking economy led to an increase in the unemployment rate, including
 because of emigrants getting back home, creating a limited number of jobs, payroll cuts or fewer
 working hours imposed by employers, amid sparse leverage that the Government could make use
 of to support the affected. The drop of remittances which previously used to provide for decent
 living conditions for the people and made it possible to avoid poverty, is the critical challenge
 factoring in making the population vulnerable today. The Government will bend efforts to find a
 balance between the first two priorities of the Plan and this priority, to establish an economic
 development model which not merely contributes to collecting public and private revenues but
 rather channels adequate amounts of public spending to the truly needy, as to avoid social
 exclusion and diminish the poverty risk. Under this circumstance, below one may find the
 following objectives and actions for this priority:

PROGRAM MONITORING AND EVALUATION

The implementation of the Program will be constantly monitored aiming at tracking the
performance of proposed actions and results achieved so that, if necessary, adequate
modifications can be made to public policies promoted by the Government in the context of this
Program. Every quarter, on the basis of the inputs of responsible public authorities, the State
Chancellery will develop monitoring reports where it will analyze the progress of implementing
the Program, indicate difficulties and make recommendations for removing constraints occurring
in the process.

Every semester, the State Chancellery, together with responsible central public administration
authorities, will develop semiannual monitoring reports. The outcomes of implementing the
Program, outlined in these reports, will be presented every six month at the sessions of the
Government and the Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program Monitoring Board lead by
the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy and consisting of representatives of the
Government, civil society and development partners. Responsible public authorities will be in




                                              71
charge of monitoring the implementation of Program actions based on a set of quantitative and
qualitative monitoring indicators established for each action included in the Program.

The evaluation of the Program is a one-time procedure carried out at the end of the Program. The
Evaluation Report, developed by the State Chancellery based on the inputs of responsible public
authorities will contain both an analysis of the performance of implementing Program actions
and the impact of these actions on the economy, the budget, population, in general, and
vulnerable population, in particular. Both during the monitoring process and during evaluation,
the Ministry of Finance will provide its advisory support to the State Chancellery and to other
public administration authorities on estimating the impact of the Program on the budget, certain
economic sectors and vulnerable categories of population.

        ANNEX 3. IMF PUBLIC INFORMATION NOTICE (PIN)

IMF Executive Board Approves US$574 million ECF/EFF Arrangements
for Moldova
Press Release No. 10/21
January 29,20 10

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved three-year
arrangements for the Re ublic of Moldova under the Extended Credit Facility and the
                          P
Extended Fund Facility.- With each facility providing an equal amount, the combined
financial assistance will be equivalent to SDR 369.6 million (about US$574.4 million) to
support the country's economic program aimed at restoring fiscal and external
sustainability, preserving financial stability, reducing poverty, and raising growth. The
approval makes an amount equivalent to SDR 60 million (about US$93.2 million)
immediately available, with the remainder available in installments subject to semiannual
reviews.

The new arrangements follow a three-year program supported by a Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility, which was approved by the IMF Executive Board in May 2006 and
expired in May 2009 (see Press Release No. 06/91). Following the Executive Board
discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, said:
"The global economic crisis led to a rapid deterioration in the Moldovan economy in 2009.
Falling demand in trading partners caused a severe downturn in exports and workers'
remittances; FDI and other capital inflows fell dramatically as well. As a result, domestic
demand collapsed, causing a sharp GDP contraction and deflationary pressures. Fiscal
pressures were exacerbated by pre-election spending hikes. "The authorities' program for
2010-12 aims to restore fiscal and external sustainability and boost growth. Fiscal policy
targets a gradual return to a sustainable position by 2012 or earlier if possible. Monetary
policy will focus on maintaining price stability. Structural reforms will support the
recovery, including by increasing the flexibility of the highly regulated economy.

The program will also increase spending for essential social services and poverty reduction.
"Fiscal policy in 2010 seeks to balance a much-needed adjustment with large public
investment and social spending needs. To reduce the deficit, the authorities have
rescheduled unaffordable wage increases and rationalized spending on materials and
subsidies. At the same time, the budget envisages a rise in targeted social assistance
spending to help protect vulnerable households. "Taking advantage of low inflation,
monetary policy will be supportive of the nascent economic recovery. To ensure that the
exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, intervention in the foreign exchange market will
be limited to smoothing short-run fluctuations. The central bank is closely monitoring
banks' financial soundness and stands ready to take preemptive action if needed.
"Structural reforms are designed to unlock the economy's growth potential and support the
fiscal program. A wide-ranging program of liberalization and deregulation is aimed at
stimulating competition and fostering private sector-led growth. To keep the social
insurance system financially sustainable, early retirement privileges of the civil servants
will be gradually phased out, and sick leave compensation will be revamped. The
authorities will also address the large quasi-fiscal arrears in the heating sector."


                                            76
Recent Economic Developments
The global economic crisis hit Moldova hard, leading to a sharp weakening of the
economy. In the first half of 2009, falling demand in trading partners led to a severe
downturn in exports and remittances. While GDP dropped by nearly 8 percent over the
same period, domestic demand declined even faster, and the current account deficit
contracted to about 11 percent of period GDP. At the same time, the balance of payments
moved from a surplus to a large deficit as Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and other
capital inflows fell dramatically. Deflation pressures persisted for most of 2009.

Program Summary
The program aims to restore fiscal and external sustainability, preserve financial stability,
and raise growth. To facilitate the adjustment, the program provides for adequate budget
financing.
Specifically, program objectives include:
(i) reversing the structural fiscal deterioration that occurred in 2008-2009 while
safeguarding f h d s for public investment and priority social spending;
(ii) keeping inflation under control while rebuilding foreign reserves to cushion the
economy from external shocks;
(iii) ensuring financial stability by enabling early detection of problems and strengthening
the framework for bank rehabilitation and resolution; and
(iv) raising the economy's potential through structural reforms.

The program will also help mobilize resources for successful implementation of the
poverty reduction agenda. To promote poverty reduction, the program sets a floor on
priority social spending. Moreover, social assistance spending will be increased by 36
percent in 2010 relative to 2009 to support vulnerable households.

         ANNEX 6. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT - SIMULATIONS OF
                      ENERGY TARIFF INCREASES

Gas, heating and electricity expenditures in Moldova have been rising for the last ten years.
Despite these increases, residential heating tariffs remained subsidized. In January, residential
utilities tar@ were increased, and in particular the heating t a r 8 was set by the regulator
ANRE at a rate consistent with cost recovery. The impact of the increases in utilities tar@ is
estimated to disproportionately affect the middle-class and relatively rich deciles of the
population. Nonetheless the poor are affected. Pensioners and the low paid in Chisinau are
affected through heating price increases. Poorer rural families are affected through electricity,
and all groups of the population are affected through increased gas targs. The compensation
scheme designed by Government with the World Bank's help (and described in the PSIA section
of this program document) offsets the worst of the impact.

Increases in Moldovan utilities tariffs over the last decade have increased household expenditure
on gas, electricity, all type of other fuels, central heating and expenditures on water and
sanitation from 5.4percent in 1998, to 14 percent in 2008 of total household consumption.
Moldova now ranks above the average of countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia on this
measure, and has the highest share of the utilities expenditure to total household consumption
among low income CIS countries (figure 1).

As Figure 2 shows, the composition of utilities expenditures in Moldova differs significantly
across sectors and income groups, making the impact of tariff increases uneven across population
groups, depending on the utility. Moldova's middle class faces the highest burden of tariff
increases because they consume a higher share of utilities in total consumption. Households
between 4* and gthdeciles of the consumption distribution have the highest shares of utilities in
consumption. In contrast, the first 2 deciles (the poor population) have the lowest, suggesting the
impact of the tariff increase will have a relatively more pronounced impact on the middle class
than on the poor. Poor people spend a much higher proportion of their utilities consumption on
electricity, followed by gas, but spend much less on central heating, and a small proportion on
other fuels. Central heating -though a politically charged issue - makes up a relatively small

 Excluding water and sanitation component the utilities expenditure level in Moldova is around 11 percent.

Figure 3 shows the composition of households' expenditures by type of utilities, location, and
age group. Households in Chisinau rely more on electricity and central heating, while households
in other cities spend more on gas and other alternative sources of fuels. Rural households spend
less on electricity and much more on wood, coal and alternative energy sources. Younger people
spend more on electricity and less on the alternative energy sources. Income groups also
consume more of some utilities than others. Poor people spend relatively more on electricity and
are thus more vulnerable to changes in electricity tariffs than heating.

Table 1 shows the proposed increase in the utilities. The World Bank staff analyzed the impact
of the increase in the utility tariffs on poverty, and estimated the monetary loss of income
deciles. Our analysis assumes a loss in the household's income equivalent to the increase in the
tariffs multiplied by the household's current level of consumption. It is important to emphasize
that this partial analysis does not take into consideration the elasticity of consumption or the

poverty is presented in the figure 4.

The results are:
           Poverty rates are projected to increase by 1.2 percentage points.
       0   As low income groups are more dependent on electricity, the increase in electricity
           tariffs has a stronger impact on poverty; even though the magnitude of the proposed
            increase in electricity is lower than for other utilities.
       0   Pensioners are vulnerable to the increase in all tariffs. Gas and heating tariffs
            significantly affect pensioners. The overall tariff increase is estimated to have
            stronger effect on pensioners than other population groups, increasing their poverty
            by 2 percentage points.
       0    Central heating has an important impact on poverty Chisinau.
            As electricity is associated with low income groups in general, all groups of the
            population are impacted significantly by higher electricity tariffs, with the impact
            most prominent in rural areas. (This is a significant finding, because in Moldova high
            electricity tariffs have tended to cross-subsidize low central heating tariffs, as CHPs
            attempted to compensate for losses on heating through higher tariffs for electricity.

Figure 5 decomposes the fiscal burden of the proposed tariffs increase by deciles of income
distribution and location. Households in the top 10 percentile of the income distribution will pay
24 percent of the tariff increases. Poor people, mostly found in lowest 3 deciles of the
distribution, will pay 12 percent of the cost of the program. Thus, the majority of the estimated
cost falls on middle and rich group of the population. Nevertheless, taking into consideration
low incomes, the burden on the poor population is significant, and requires special attention.

The targeted social assistance program proposed in the DPO program should compensate poor
families for these losses.
