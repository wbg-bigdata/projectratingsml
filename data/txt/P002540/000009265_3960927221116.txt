CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe
Beneficiaries:            Sponsoring agencies comprising central and local
government agencies, civic groups, cooperatives,
religious groups and private entrepreneurs.
Amount:                   SDR 3.9 million (US$5.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Standard, with 40 years maturity
Onlending Terms:          The proceeds of the Credit would be passed on as
grant to SIF. In turn SIF would finance sub-
projects in Classifications I (Social Assistance,
SA) and II (Social Infrastructure Improvement,
SI) on a grant basis; and subprojects in
Classification III (Economic Improvement, EI)
through loans. Loans for capital improvements
will be for a maximum maturity period of 15 years
including up to 5 years of grace and would bear
an interest rate set at 2Z above the long term
inflation rate. Loans for working capital would
normally have shorter maturities and interest
rates would be linked to the commercial rates
charged by the Banco Nacional de Sao Tome e
Principe.
Finarcing Plan:           Government                US$1.0 million
IDA                       US$5.0 million
Co-financing              US$2.0 million
TOTAL                     US$8.0 million
Economic Rate of Return: All subprojects under Classifications II (Social
Infrastructure Improvement) and III (Economic
Improvement) with an estimated cost equivalent to
US$50,000 or more would require a minimum ERR of
122. Approved Water Supply and Market
Subprojects have an estimated ERR of 14% and
232 respectively.  (Water Supply Subproject 14Z;

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
FOR A MULTI-SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for
SDR 3.9 million (US$5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and
would help finance a multi-sector project. The project would be cofinanced
by other donors for SDR 1.5 million (US$2 million equivalant).
2.        Background.  The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe
(STP), a country of about 110,000 people and with an area of about 1,000
sq. kms. is facing the major task of rebuilding its economic and physical
infrastructure which has been deteriorating for some time. The combination
of failing to maintain the cocoa estates (Rocas) and unfortunate economic
decisions in the past resulted in a substantial drop in export earnings and
a heavy public investment program financed by non-concessional loans that
brought about a deepening economic and financial crisis. In reacting to
this crisis, the Government adopted a comprehensive Structural Adjustment
Program (SAP) with the obiective of liberalizing production and trade.
Because of the macro economic imbalances described above and despite the
Government's commitment to a program of structural adjustment, the economic
recovery program is not likely to benefit some of the most vulnerable
groups in the near future. These include the urban and rural poo., the
unemployed or underemployed workers who were already suffering economic
hardship in the failing economy prior to the SAP, as well as small farmers
in rural areas with low productivity. STP has initiated the implementation
of policies to deal with macro-economic problems.
3.        Rationale for IDA involvemenL.  IDA's involvement is critical at
this juncture to help this small country cope with economic decline, by
protecting the most vulnerable groups while the SAP takes effect. IDA's
involvement would help ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place for
short-term recovery from the curren_ crisis and long-term economic
development. Furthermore, IDA's lead in this project would further
encourage involvement by the international donor community and provide much
needed planning and coordination of donor activities.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project seeks to mitigate the
social and economic cost of structural adjustment by generating income and
employment opportunities for the low income and underemployed urban and
rural household and to the civil servants to be retrenched. The proposed
project would help improve, in the start-up phase, basic services through
education, health, water supply rehabilitation and provision of a market
facility. Subsequent phases would include other social sectors and would
also support and encourage the development of the country's emerging
private sector.
5.        Project Description.  To meet its objectives the proposed
project would help in the organization of the Social and Infrastructure



-2-
Fund (SIF) that will finance the preparation and implementation of priority
subprojects with high economic and social rates of return. SIF would be an
autonomous financing and monitoring agency with full administrative,
technical and financial autonomy. The proposed project would help
establish SIF's management procedures and operating criteria to allow the
appraisal and monitoring of viable subprojects covering both employment,
income generation and social assistance projects implemented by sponsoring
agencies, such as entities of the national or local government, civic and
religious organizations, cooperatives, Non-Governmental Organizations, and
individuals or corporate entities from the private sector, under the
technical supervision of appropriate agencies. SIF would be adequately
staffed and technical assistance would be provided to ensure an expeditious
implementation of the project. Three major classifications of subprojects
have been identified, and at least one subproject in each classification
(Textbook Printing, Education Planning, Malaria and Endemic Disease
Control, Health Planning and Management, under Classification I: Social
Assistance; Water Supply Rehabilitation, under Classification II: Social
Infrastructure; and, Peira do Ponto Market under Classification IIT:
Economic Improvement) has been appraised and would be implemented during
the start up phase to permit on-the-job training and direct operational
experience to SIF. Economic Improvement subprojects will mostly come on
stream after SIF's appraisal capabilities have been strengthened. The
proceeds of the Credit would be passed on as grant to SIF. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$8 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$5.4 million (67? of total cost). A project cost summary
and tentative financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Project procurement
arrangements and IDA credit disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in STP are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No.7663-STP dated May 15, 1989 is attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with the Government
and SIF to: (a) establish SIF's internal organization acceptable to IDA;
(b) take immediate action regarding SIF's staffing needs and if qualified
candidates are not available, to retain fixed-term consultants;
(c) establish no financial institution for providing credit for subprojects
similar to those for economic improvement financed under SIF, without prior
approval of IDA; (d) submit to IDA for comments and approval, beginning
November 30, 1990 and by November 30 of each subsequent year, SIF's
proposed action plan covering its operations for the following twelve
months; (e) ensure that all subprojects will be appraised, implemented and
supervised according to criteria acceptable to IDA; and (f) submit to IDA
quarterly progress reports covering all areas of SIF operations, including
information on the effectiveness of meeting the objectives of financed
subprojects. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness will include:
(a) execution by Government and SIP of the Subsidiary Administration
Agreement and the adoption of SIFPs bylaws acceptable to IDA;
(b) preparation of the final version of the Action Plan covering the first
year of all SIF operations; (c) recruitment of a Project Management
Consultant and assumption of duties; (d) preparation and adoption of an
Operational Procedures Guide for appraising, processing and monitoring
subprojects; (e) submission of a model agreement for each subprojert
classification; and (f) establishment of an accounting system in SXF.
Conditions of disbursement will include: prior review and approval by IDA



- 3 -
of all subprojects up to an aggregate of US$2.1 million, all subprojects in
Classifications I and II costing more than US$100,000 and all subprojects
in Classification III costing more than US$50,000.
7.        Benefits.  The essential project justification lies in the
benefits of employment generation and the improvement of social standards
in the country. All subprojects to be financed are essential items that
need to be undertaken in any case, and would be justified on their own
merits. Furthermore, SIF would introduce discipline in the evaluation of
subprojects and it will be the first step toward introducing the concept of
cost recovery. Subprojects would help to improve sanitation, health,
education, basic infrastructure and would encourage the implementation of
programs promoted by the private sector. The project would increase
productivity, improve the management of public enterprises, and will
stimulate growth of the emerging private sector that would increase the
country's revenue base and employment opportunity for the population. The
Water Supply and the Market subprojects have an estimated economic rate of
return of 14? and 23Z respectively.
8.        Risks.  Possible risks relate to SIF's untested capacity to
maintain an adequate standard of subproject appraisal and management of the
implementation process and the limited experience of the government in
dealing with autonomous entities that could impede the role of the Board of
Administrators and of SIF's Executive Administrator. However, the project
would provide adequate technical assistance at an early stage by
experienced consultants who would work alongside local counterparts. This,
coupled with an agreed appraisal criteria, comprehensive conditionalities
including an Operational Procedures Guide and close monitoring of progress
through joint reviews of quarterly reports and action programs would
effectively mitigate these risks. Assurances were received from the
Government that SIF's independence would be maintained.
9.      Recouiendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the International Development
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
