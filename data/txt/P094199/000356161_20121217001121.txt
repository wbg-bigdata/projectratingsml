                                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.     This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the Municipalities of Bagé,
Santa Maria and Rio Grande to amend the Loan Agreements for their respective
individual Integrated Municipal Infrastructure Projects, within the scope of the Rio
Grande do Sul Integrated Municipal Development APL Program (Programa de
Desenvolvimento Municipal Integrado do Rio Grande do Sul – PDMI): Bagé Rainha da
Fronteira (7582-BR), Projeto Santa Maria 2020 (7648-BR) and Programa Rio Grande
2010: Uma Visão de Futuro (7682-BR). These are three of the five participating
municipalities under the PDMI.

2.      The amendments encompass the following changes: (i) adjustments to the scope
of loan-financed activities to reflect changing municipal priorities and a reduced
implementation period, with a reduction in scope due to the exchange rate fluctuations
and the steep increase in construction costs since the projects were appraised; (ii) revision
of the results framework to reflect the proposed adjustments and reduction in scope, to
make indicators more monitorable and to incorporate core indicators; (iii) reallocation of
funds between expenditure categories and in some cases an increase in the percentage of
loan financing to offset the impact of the delay in Project implementation and accelerate
loan disbursement; and (iv) correction of a typo in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) specifically related to the Project safeguard category for the Bagé Project. In
addition, the Municipality of Santa Maria has requested a 12 months extension of closing
date. These proposed changes do not require or entail changes to the original Program or
Projects Development Objectives (PDO).

3.      The Program consists of three components, followed by the individual projects:
(1) Municipal Strengthening, which includes Public Service Modernization and Project
Management; (2) Employment and Income Generation, which includes (i) preparing local
economic development strategies, and facilitating micro and small business access to
micro-credit and improvement of the effectiveness of such business, and (ii) providing
support to productive subprojects in the agriculture sector; and (3) Infrastructure Service
Improvements, which includes, inter alia, urban and street upgrading, water and
sanitation improvements and integrated municipal solid waste management activities.

4.     The original Projects’ costs estimates are as follows:

                                             Loan Amount         Counterpart   Total Project

Projeto Santa Maria 2020 (7648-BR)              $13.95              $9.25         $23.20

Futuro (7682-BR)
5.      The Borrowers’ primary reason for requesting a restructuring of their respective
Projects is to better align the planned activities to the current context and priorities of
each Municipality, including the adjustment to the remaining timeline available. These
restructurings were thoroughly discussed with each Municipality since the mid-term
reviews, which took place between end-2009 and mid-2010. The proposals were
subsequently finalized by the individual Borrowers and were sent to the Federal
Government for its endorsement as Guarantor. The following factors are the main drivers
of the proposed restructurings:

a. The Brazilian Real (BRL) has appreciated significantly against the United States
   Dollar (USD) since Project preparation, going from an average of BRL 2.2 for USD 1
   at the time of appraisal/approval to an average exchange rate of BRL 1.77 since 2010,
   corresponding to the contracting and disbursement launch periods;
b. There has been a significant increase in construction costs in Brazil, accompanying the
   scaling up of Federal Government’s investment in infrastructure and economic growth.
   The national index for building costs (INCC) for instance posted a 23 percent increase
   in the last two years. Therefore, the cost of Project activities, mainly works, came out
   higher than originally estimated;
c. Important Federal Government funds for infrastructure (the Growth Acceleration
   Program, PAC) and housing (the Minha Casa Minha Vida Program) became available
   after loan approvals, and have in some cases been mobilized / used by municipalities
   to finance investments originally earmarked for loan financing. Such changes were
   deemed necessary by the Municipalities to maximize the use of available funding and
   thus prompted the need to revise the original investment plans to reallocate loan funds
   to other complementary/interlinked activities that contribute to achieving the PDOs;
d. There were long gaps between appraisal, loan signing and effectiveness reflecting the
   time needed by each municipality to satisfy the requirements of the Fiscal
   Responsibility Law. This resulted in reduced Project implementation periods, thus
   necessitating adjustments to the scope of the Projects. There were also delays in
   initiating some activities related to the procurement processes and/or the finalization of
   the detailed designs. In some cases, changes to the municipal government’s priorities
   also were reflected in the adjustments.

6.      As a result, the total costs of key loan-financed activities, especially works,
increased from the original estimates. In response, the municipalities were eventually
able to increase their share of counterpart financing by leveraging Federal Government
resources. Ultimately, however, the reduced implementation timeframe and the resources
available to the municipalities were insufficient to carry out all of the planned activities
and achieve the expected results and impacts by the Projects’ closing date. Consequently,
an overall reduction in scope has become necessary.

     PHASE 3: INTEGRATED MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
                (BAGÉ RAINHA DA FRONTEIRA) – 7582-BR



B. PROJECT STATUS

7.    This Project was approved by the Board on July 23, 2008 in the amount of
US$6,600,000. The Loan Agreement was signed on November 11, 2008, and the Project
became effective on January 7, 2009.

8.      The Project has three components: (1) Municipal Strengthening, which aims to
strengthen the Municipality’s capacity to more effectively and efficiently execute its
programs, respond to demand for the provision of water and sanitation services, and
implement and mainstream improved appraisal, fiduciary and environmental and social
procedures; (2) Employment and Income Generation, aimed at strengthening the
Municipality’s capacity to generate employment and income through training for small
and micro businesses and supporting rural productive activities; and (3) Infrastructure
Service Improvements, which encompasses investments in urban and street upgrading
and water and sanitation.

9.      The Project is evidencing solid implementation progress. Up to November 1,
2012, the Project had disbursed US$ 5.96 million or 90.3% of the loan amount. The large
part of Project activities have been completed or are well underway. Activities under
Component 2, including the LED strategy, training to SME staff, and support to
productive activities in the agriculture sector, have all been completed. Under Component
3, the rehabilitation/paving of 5.3 kilometers (km) of streets with drainage systems has
been completed. Infrastructure for the macro-metering of water was completed and over
2,000 individual water meters were installed. The expansion of the sewerage system,
including 36 km of pipes and seven small wastewater treatment facilities was also
completed. Under Component 1, the preparation of the Municipal water and sanitation
master plan and the cadaster of water users are well underway. There are no safeguards or
fiduciary compliance issues.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

10.     Adjustments to Project activities. The appreciation of the BRL against the USD,
the increase in construction costs, and the delays between Project appraisal, approval and
implementation launch have all led to the total costs of Project activities exceeding
original estimates. Although the municipality was eventually able to increase its share of
counterpart financing, the available implementation timeframe and resources remained
insufficient to carry out all planned Project activities by the closing date. This contributed
to the need to restructure the Project through some adjustments in Project scope,
including the addition of an activity to enhance the sustainability of urban roads
investments and the reduction of other activities. Specifically, under Component 1, the
preparation of a geographic Information system for the water users’ cadaster was
postponed due to higher than anticipated costs. Under Component 3, the acquisition of
maintenance equipment for roads was added in the scope of the Project to strengthen

                                              3
      municipal capacity to perform its functions sustainably in the future. The rehabilitation of
      segments of the water supply system and expansion of the water distribution network is
      proposed to be excluded as alternative funding under PAC was made available and the
      implementation timeframe was adjusted accordingly. The increase in water treatment
      reservoir capacity is also proposed to be excluded due to higher than anticipated costs. As
      for drainage investments, while these were implemented in all streets paved/rehabilitated
      by the Project, alternative sources of funding are being sought for system expansion.

      11.     Results/indicators. Revisions to the Project’s results framework are proposed in
      the table below to reflect the adjustments and reduction in scope of the Project. These
      revisions also streamline the indicators and are more suited to monitor and capture the
      Project’s impacts in line with its revised scope. Where feasible, revisions are proposed to
      align the specific Bagé Project indicators with indicators from the other individual
      Projects under the PDMI APL, to allow aggregating results across the Program. Core
      indicators are also introduced. See Annex 1.

12.      Safeguards. While there are no changes to the safeguards categories or activities,
this restructuring corrects a typo in the original PAD (datasheet and in Annex 16), which
incorrectly listed the Project as Environmental Category A. In reality, the Project is an
Environmental Category B, as appraised and approved by the Board and as reflected in
all official documentation. A corrigendum had been sent to the Board in June 2009.

13.    Financing plan and disbursement estimate. The revised financing plan,
included below, reflects the increase in counterpart funding mobilized by the
Municipality. The disbursement estimate is also reflected below.

14.     Reallocations of funds amongst expenditure categories: The proposed
reallocation of loan proceeds between expenditure categories is as follows. The
percentage of expenditures financed under expenditure categories 1(a) and 2(a) is also
increased to 100 percent to enable a further acceleration of disbursements and a full use
of all loan funds before the Project Closing Date. Categories 1(b) and 2(b) have been
fully disbursed.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

15.    Technical. Activities excluded from the Project have neither impacted the PDO
nor the main objectives of each component. Exclusion of originally planned activities
was thoroughly discussed with the Borrower, and although not financed with loan funds
or implemented in the Project’s timeframe, the Municipality is fully committed to
mobilize resources, where none is yet available, to guarantee their execution.

   PHASE 4: INTEGRATED MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
 (PROGRAMA DE DESENVOLVIMENTO SUSTENT?VEL PARA A REGIÃO
      DE SANTA MARIA – PROJETO SANTA MARIA 2020) – 7648-BR



E. PROJECT STATUS

16.   This Project was approved by the Board on December 23, 2008 in the amount of
US$13,950,000. The Loan Agreement was signed in March 4, 2010, and the Project
became effective on June 2, 2010.

17.     The Project has three components: (i) Component 1: Municipal Strengthening,
focusing on capacity to implement fiduciary, environmental and social aspects of
projects, and improve the quality and efficiency of municipal services; (ii) Component 2:
Income and Employment Generation, focusing on improving municipal capacity to
promote entrepreneurship, improving recycling and solid waste management as an
income generating activity, implementing a technological park and a Business Innovation
Incubator; and Component 3: Infrastructure Services Improvements, supporting
improvements in urban and rural roads, and environmental rehabilitation of water bodies
through water, sanitation, drainage and paving.

18.      Up to November 2012, the Project had disbursed US$ 4.22 million or 30% of the
loan amount, and US$ 5.59 million or 79% of counterpart funds. The full remaining loan
amount is either committed (around 60 percent) or being procured. Several Project
activities have been implemented or are ongoing. Under Component 1, engineering
designs for selected infrastructure projects were concluded while the preparation of a
transport master plan is underway. Under Component 2, the implementation of a
technological park is underway, expected to be concluded in May 2013. Under
Component 3, multiple improvements to the municipal road network were completed,
while another 3 km are underway, to be concluded in January 2013. Maintenance
equipment for rural roads was provided. Improvement of environmental quality and
preservation of a river micro-basin and improvement of drainage, infrastructure, public
facilities and open spaces in a residential neighborhood is ongoing. There are no
safeguards or fiduciary compliance issues.

F. PROPOSED CHANGES

19.     Adjustments to Project activities. The appreciation of the BRL against the
USD, the increase in construction costs, and the delays between Project appraisal,
approval and implementation launch have all led to the total cost of Project activities
exceeding original estimates. Moreover, a new municipal administration came into office
after loan negotiation and before signing. Related change of municipal staff, including the
project implementation team, and the timeframe needed to understand the Project and
implementation procedures delayed the Project’s take off. The new administration
proposed some changes in Project activities within the scope of the PDO and the
objectives of each component. These activities were discussed in the May 2011 mid-term
review, after which implementation accelerated. The main works and consultancies

                                            7
effectively started in June 2012 after conclusion of the bidding processes. Activities
underway comprise 63% of the loan amount and activities equivalent to another 35% of
the loan amount are under procurement.

20.     Key proposed adjustments to the Project scope include the following. Under
Component 1, new proposed activities include an urban aero-photogrammetry survey to
identify land development possibilities and improve property taxation collection, a
municipal water supply and sanitation master plan as required by law for municipalities
to sign concession contracts with utilities, and a Master Plan for Information Technology
(IT). Acquisition of IT equipment was dropped, as the Master Plan is needed to identify
the needs. Training of municipal staff was concluded with local funds. Under Component
2, activities to promote entrepreneurship would include the preparation of a strategy to
promote microcredit, capacity building, and set up of a community facility. Solid waste
recycling and support to waste collectors would be financed with different sources, and
related planned investments would be postponed until the Municipal Integrated Sanitation
Master Plan, currently underway, is concluded. The business incubator was excluded as it
was financed by the University of Santa Maria, while the central warehouse facility
improvement was excluded after the rail company that owns the facility identified an
alternative use for the site.

21.     Under Component 3, the scope of the urban road improvements was reduced due
to lack of resources, while the rehabilitation of rural roads and bridges was reoriented to
municipal funds. Activities related to the construction of resettlement housing and
infrastructure improvements in the Cancela stream area were excluded after the
mobilization of PAC funding, and will follow a different timeframe. To support
environmental improvement, the preservation of river basins and the improvement of
quality of life of the local population, the implementation of two urban parks were
integrated, together with preparation of environmental management plans for
conservation areas. The restructuring reflects the transfer of the coordination of the
Project from the General Secretariat to the Secretariat for Strategic Planning and Special
Projects (PLANEPE). Finally, the restructuring reflects a proposed extension of closing
date of 12 months, until December 31, 2013, to enable a satisfactory conclusion of
planned activities.

22.     Results/indicators. Revisions to the Project’s results framework are proposed in
the table below to reflect the adjustments and reduction in scope of the Project. These
revisions also streamline the indicators and are more suited to monitor and capture the
Project’s impacts in line with its revised scope. Where feasible, revisions are proposed to
align the specific Santa Maria Project indicators with indicators from the other individual
Projects under the PDMI APL, to allow aggregating results across the Program. Core
indicators are also introduced. See Annex 2.

24.     Reallocations of funds amongst expenditure categories: The proposed
reallocation of loan proceeds between expenditure categories and adjustments to the
definition of the categories (including merger of sub-categories) is as follows. The
percentage of expenditures financed under each category remains the same at 100
percent. It is important to note that procurement processes for newly proposed activities
were carried out following Bank guidelines, thus making them eligible for reimbursement
under revised financing percentages if requested by the Borrower.

G. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

26.     Technical. The new changes to Project activities have been discussed with the
Borrower. New proposed activities (and related technical documents and safeguards
requirements) have been thoroughly appraised by the Bank. The new proposed activities,
combined with the original ones, would contribute to achieving the PDO. The Municipal
government’s commitment to the Project remains firmly in place to execute the Project in
an effective and timely basis.

   PHASE 5: INTEGRATED MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
(RIO GRANDE: PROGRAMA RIO GRANDE 2010: UMA VISÃO DE FUTURO) –
                          7682-BR



H. PROJECT STATUS

27.   This Project was approved by the Board on July 07, 2009 in the amount of
US$8.10 million. The Loan Agreement was signed on February 25, 2010, and the Project
became effective on April 16, 2010.

28.     The Project has three components: (1) Municipal Strengthening, aimed at
strengthening the municipality’s capacity to more effectively and efficiently execute its
programs and implement and mainstream the appraisal, fiduciary and environmental and
social procedures; (2) Employment and Income Generation, aimed at supporting
employment and income generation by preparing a long-term LED strategy and a strategy
for the tourism sector, and improving the business environment; and (3) Infrastructure
Service Improvements, aimed at improving selected urban roads and drainage services,
and preparation of an environmental rehabilitation, resettlement and socio-economic
integration plan for the Henrique Pancada community.

29.     Up to November 01, 2012, the Project had disbursed US$ 6.48 million or 80.0%
of the loan amount. Several Project activities have been completed or are ongoing. Under
Component 1, activities concluded include acquisition of equipment to facilitate client
responsive services, automation of computer systems and integration of databases, staff
training, and implementation of an IT wireless network linking public facilities buildings
including schools and health centers. Under Component 2, the preparation of the LED
and tourism sector strategies are underway. Under Component 3, 12 km of urban roads
and a drainage system were completed, and the paving of a main urban transport corridor
of 21 km was underway. There are no safeguards or fiduciary compliance issues.

I. PROPOSED CHANGES

30.     Adjustments to Project activities. The appreciation of the BRL against the USD,
the increase in construction costs, and the delays between Project appraisal, approval and
implementation launch have led to the total costs of Project activities exceeding original
estimates. This together with the unforeseen availability of other sources of funds for
some Project activities originally up for financing with loan resources and the reduced
implementation period all led to the need for restructuring and adjustments in the Project
scope. Proposed changes are as follows. Under Component 2, the remaining
implementation timeframe was not adequate to retaining the streamlining of firm
registration procedures as part of the effort to improve the business environment, and as
such it is proposed to be dropped and implemented with local funds in 2013. Under
Component 3, it is proposed to drop the activity related to the preparation of an
environmental rehabilitation, resettlement and socio-economic integration plan for the
Henrique Pancada community, as the loan which the Municipality intended to contract to
implement such works did not materialize. Instead, the Municipality proposes to include

                                           13
another activity with an equivalently important socio-environmental impact, namely the
regularization of land titling for some 3,500 urban lots to provide security of tenure for
14,000 residents. With this activity, the Municipality will have completed the
regularization of land titles for 95 percent of its population.

31.     Results / indicators. Revisions to the Project’s results framework are proposed
in the table below to reflect the adjustments and reduction in scope of the Project. These
revisions also streamline the indicators and are more suited to monitor and capture the
Project’s impacts in line with its revised scope. Where feasible, revisions are proposed to
align the specific Rio Grande Project indicators with indicators from the other individual
Projects under the PDMI APL, to allow aggregating results across the Program. Core
indicators are also introduced. See Annex 3.

33.     Reallocations of funds amongst expenditure categories: The proposed
reallocation of loan proceeds between expenditure categories is as follows. The
percentage of expenditures financed under each expenditure category is also increased to
100 percent to enable a further acceleration of disbursements and a full use of all loan
funds before the Project Closing Date. It is important to note that procurement processes
for newly proposed activities were carried out following Bank guidelines, thus making
them eligible for reimbursement under revised financing percentages if requested by the
Borrower.

J. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

34.      Technical. Activities excluded from the Project neither impact the PDO or
component objectives. Exclusion of originally planned activities was thoroughly
discussed with the Borrower, and although not financed with loan funds or implemented
in the Project’s timeframe, the Municipality is fully committed to mobilize resources,
where none is yet available, to guarantee execution. The inclusion of technical assistance
and services to provide ownership rights for around 3,500 urban plots will benefit
approximately 14,000 inhabitants with important positive socio-economic and
environmental impacts. Implementation support has been initiated by the Bank and
activities are underway. When concluded, the municipal government will have
regularized land titles for 95% of the municipal population. New proposed activities (and
related technical documents and safeguards requirements) have been thoroughly
appraised by the Bank.
