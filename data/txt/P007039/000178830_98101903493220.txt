ECUADOR
APPRAISAL OF AN EDIJCATION PROJECT
SUNMARY
The Government of Ecuador has requested International Development
Association financial assistance for an education project. An appraisal
mission visited Ecuador in October, 1967.
ii.     The proposed project is the priority program of a comprehensive
education development plan which aims at improving and expanding the system and
relating its output to the projected needs of the economy, with particular
reference to the source of middle-level manpower - the second cycle of secon-
dary education.
iii.    To economize on scarce resources, technical, agricultural and teacher
training schools are to become second-cycle only and be concentrated in a
small number of well-equipped schools including the project schools.
iv.     This consolidation program also incliues the conversion and moderniza-
tion of existing secondary schools. These and newly constructed schools would
conform to the re-organization requirements and permit introduction of recent-
ly developed modern curricula in which practical subjects and the sciences
have been emphasized.
v.      The proposed project is designed to promote achievement of these
planned objectives. It comprises construction and equipment of 28 secondary
schools, a technical assistance component to assure efficient operation of the
project schools, and establishment of a special unit to supervise execution of
the project. Construction consists of: (a) extensions to four agricultural
schools; (b) one new technical school and extensions to three others; (c) four
new primary teacher-training schools and extensions to one existing school;
(d) eight new and extensions to one first cycle schoolss and three new and
extensions to three schools offering both first and second cycle in general
secondary education.
vi.     Total enrollments in the project schools would be 19,600, an addition
of 13,100 over present enrollments in the existing project schools. Total
annual output would be 5,600. Annual output of over 2,000 in the 13 agri-
cultural, technical and teacher training schools would compare with the 1,600
from 76 such schools now operating. The proposed project thus would provide
64%s 53% and 50% of the estimated required total output in 1975 from agri-
cultural, technical and teacher training schools respectively, and about 7% of
the projected first and second cycle general secondary school output.
vii.    Teacher-training in-service and pre-service programs have been prepared
and it is essential that these be implemented if the teacher supply for the
project schools and for the rest of the planned improvement of secondary
education is to be assured.
viii.   Technical assistance will be required to assist in the conduct of
these programs and to give on-the-job training to directors and teachers of the
project schools.



- ii -
ix.     The supply of qualified entrants into the project schools is assured,
as are job opportunities for those graduates who do not proceed to further
studies.
Xe      The project schools are suitably located; 21 of 28 sites have already
been selected and acquired and are satisfactory. Schedules of acconmodation
and equipment are economical and consistent with functional needs. Estimated
costs of constructions equipment and furniture are reasonable. Contract
awards and procurement would conform to international competitive bidding
procedures.
xi.     A project unit and employment of private architects will be necessary
for implementation of the project. There is no shortage of competent local
building contractors and adequate building skills are available.
xii.    The Government is able to meet its share of the capital cost of the
proposed project and the consequential recurrent expenditures. However, the
Government's capacity to meet the foreseeable expansion in the education
system as a whole is doubtful if secondary school enrollment is not strictly
regulated.
xiii.   The estimated cost of the project is US $10.2 million, of which 38% is
for construction of teaching accommodation, 5% for dormitories, 1% for staff
housing, 28% for furniture and equipment, 5% for site development, 5% for
project unit costs and professional fees, 3% for technical assistance and 15%
for contingencies. The foreign exchange component is estimated at $4.5 million
or 44% of the estimated total cost of the project.
xiv.    The project is considered suitable for a credit of $5.1 million or
50% of the total cost for a period of 50 years including a grace period of 10
years. The disbursement period would be four years; construction should be
completed by the middle of 1972.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN ECUADOR
1. INTRODUCTION
The Request
1.01    In October, 1966, a Unesco project identification mission cooperated
with the Ecuadorian authorities in establishing priority educational needs.
In July-August, 1967, a Unesco project preparation mission assisted Ecuador
in the elaboration of a request to IDA for assistance to expand and improve
secondary education facilities.  The request was submitted in August, 1967 and
an appraisal mission composed of Dbssrs. C. L. Germanacos (general educator),
A. Nacris (agricultural education), F. Lethem (economist), K. Andersen (Unesco,
architect) and R. Eyles (consultant, technical education) visited Ecuador in
October, 1967.
1.02    The proposed project is part of a ten-year educational development
plan initiated in 1964 which seeks to modernize the education and training
system, bringing it nearer to the economic needs of the country, particularly
in regard to technical, agricultural and teacher education, and to effect
economies by redeployment of resources and consolidation of facilities.
1.03    The proposed project, which underwent minor modifications during
appraisal, consists of:
(i) extensions to and equipment of four agricultural secondary
schools;
(ii)  construction and equipment of a new technical secondary school,
and equipment of and extensions to three existing technical
secondary schools;
(iii) construction and equipment of four primary teacher-training
schools and extensions to and equipment of one other;
(iv) construction and equipment of (a) eight new and extensions to one
first cycle general secondary schools, and (b) three new and
three existing schools offering both first and second cycle
general secondary education;
(v) technical assistance of 12 man-years to provide specialists in
teacher-training and project school administration;
and    (vi)  establishment of a project unit to supervise execution of the
project.
The possible enrollment of the 28 schools would be 19,600 of which some 13,100
would be additional places. The total estimated cost is US $10.2 million
equivalent.
Salient Socio-Economic Features
1.04    Population: Ecuador's population, estimated at 5.4 million in 1966,
is expanding at a rate of 3.4% per annum, leading to heavy pressure on the
school system (para. 2.20). Relatively more favorable economic and social,
including educational, opportunities in Quito and Guayaquil, the major cities



- 2 -
in the Sierra and the Costa Regions respectively, attract migration fram the
rural areas where population has been growing at only 2.2% per annum. The
educational plan makes allowance for these migratory trends, but also aims at
decelerating the movement by providing better educational opportunities in
canton and parish centers.
1.05    Labor Force:  Some 55% of the labor force, estimated at 1.6 million
in 1965, was employed in agriculture, 14% in small industry and handicrafts
and 13% in services. About 30% of the total labor force is illiterate. As
in many developing countries, the education sector is one of the major
employers of manpower with secondary and university level training (Annex 1).
The average female participation rate of 20 percent in the labor force is low;
it is expected to rise to 40% by 1975 for school leaving girls.
1.06    Economic Situation: Between 1961 and 1965 the average gross domestic
product growth rate was 4.9% per annum, largely as a result of the growth of
agricultural exports (banana, coffee, cocoa). Agriculture alone in 1966
accounted for 35% of GDP and more than 90% of the countryts foreign exchange
earrnings. The manufacturing industry is small both as an employer and as a
contributor to GDP and has failed to absorb manpower at a rate matching the
growth of the urban labor force. lmployers, aware of the need to increase
productivity, are relying increasingly on better qualified workers and
trained technicians as they become available to the labor market.
1.07    Development Plans:  The ten year plan for social and economic
development (1964-1973) assumed an average annual GDP growth rate of more than
6% but this has been revised downward to 5.5% as a result of deteriorating
export prospects. In view of the performance of the economty until 1965
(para. 1.06), for the purpose of projecting manpower needs in this report
GDP has been assumed to grow at an average rate of 4.9% per annum from its
1962 level, and productivity per man at 2.1% per annum. This would result in
a total employment of some 2.1 million by 1975 against a total labor force
of 2.2 million (Chart 4), thus leaving unemployment at 5% or about its 1962
level.
2.  EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The Structure and Administration of Education
2.01    The education system as re-structured by the Education Development
Plan, 1964-1973, provides for a six-year obligatory primary course followed
by a three-year first or basic cycle secondary school course (Chart 1). The
latter is terminal in itself, but selected students may progress into a second
or diversified cycle of three years where, according to their aptitude and
interest, they are channelled into general secondary, teacher-training,
technical industrial, commercial, or agricultural studies. The general
secondary schools will emphasize courses with a mathematics-science content
or a social studies content. All second cycle courses lead to the Bachillerato
award, the graduation certificate of full secondary education. Entrance to
the autonomous universities is controlled by faculty entrance examinations.
2.02    The Ilinistry of Education, municipalities and private authorities
administer their respective sectors of the system at primary and secondary



- 3 -
level. The ultimate authority lies with the Minister of Education who
formulates policy, prescribes educational legislation and regulates in
particular curricula, syllabi, diploma awards and certification of teachers.
This control is highly centralized, but government policy is sometimes
negated by misdirected initiative assumed by municipal and private authorities
and even by some directors of public schools. A high-quality inspectorate
could help improve liaison between the schools and the central authority.
It is planned to up-grade the present large supervisory body, but more field
visits are required if it is to work effectively.
2.03    The various departments of the Ministry of Education are directed
by a sub-secretary, the administrative head (Chart 2). The professional
services, headed by a director-general, deal alsq with administrative matters
so that their technical skills are inadequately utilized. The Planning
Department of the ministry works closely with thejcentral Planning Board.
Preparation of the proposed project has brought about some coruwnication
betwTeen the Planning Department and the Schools' Cpnstruction Department and
other rLinistry departments.
2.04    The Minister of Agriculture administers a nimber of public agricultural
secondary schools through a department of agricultural education. Other public
and private agricultural secondary schools fall within the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Education.
Primary Education
2.05    In 1965-1966 enrollment in some 6,700 primary schools with 21,400
teachers was 800X500, equivalent to 80 percent of the 6-12 years age group,
but over-age students numbered 90,000 (Chart 3 and Annexes 2 and 3). Private
schools, catered for 18/o of the enrollment, public schools for 70S and mmnici-
pal for 12o. The teacher-pupil ratio was 1:38  but less than 56, of the
'teaching force held teaching diplomas (Annex 45.
2.06    The 1974 enrollment target of 1,274,000, equivalent to 92 percent
of the 6-12 years age-group is attainable. Recently introduced curricular and
structural reforms should improve the flow of students through the system and
reduce the present 'drop-out' rate of 78 percent.  This improvement would be
stimulated further by better-qualified teachers.
Second Level Education
2.07    Second level enrollments have trebled in the last decade (Annex 2).
In 1965-1966 the enrollment of 118,40O in all types of secondary schools was
equivalent to 18 percent of the 13-18 years age-group. Over 52;< of the students
attend public schools (Annex 3). Enrollments in the second cycle were 55%
in general secondary, 16% in primary teacher-training, 23% in commercial
education and only 6% in other types of technical education.
2.08    Rising enrollments have not been matched by the provision of adequate
facilities.  Many schools are small, uneconomic units with particularly small
numbers in the second cycle. The bigger schools are overcrowded. Few schools
have satisfactory laboratory or workshop facilities, or are adequately
supplied with teaching materials. Mt1aintenance is neglected.



- 4 -
2.09    The teaching force of 8,500 is almost entirely a part-time force
(Annex 4) including university students and practising layers, doctors,
dentists and engineers. Most teachers work in two or more schools. Only
18 percent held some recognized secondary school teacher qualification. About
a half of the remainder are adequately equipped academically for secondary
school teaching but lack specific professional training.
2.10    These defects result in limited and low quality output.  Particularly
handicapped are the vocational type schools where the scarce resources of
skilled teachers, materials and equipment are dispersed over a large number
of small uneconomic units -- 22 technical industrial, some 170 commercial,
16 agricultural, and 38 teacher-training schools.  The resources are further
fragmented by the fact that these schools still accept students into the first
cycle; these students in fact use up most of the resources (Annex 3); in
addition, the drop-out rate is especially high in such schools in conse-
quence of the many misfits resulting from too early an entry of students into
vocational schools before aptitudes can be ascertained.
2.11    In all types of secondary education, introduction of the recently
developed curricula has been delayed because the facilities have been lacking.
The curricula in the general secondary schools are highly theoretical; the
teacher-training schools under-estimate the importance of educating as well
as training the prospective teacher, and the vocational schools lack clear
objectives. In these circumstances teaching techniques are traditional also,
with active student participation the exception.
2.12    However, what improvements are possible are witnessed in the better-
endowed schools where skilled teachers have been able to iltroduce new and
purposeful curricula. Prerequisites to improvement of the quality of secondary
education of all types are the provision of relevant facilities and qualified
teachers.
2.13    Ministry of Agriculture Schools:  In addition to the six agricultural
secondary schools administered by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of
Agriculture operates nine such schools. Three offer full secondary courses
(grades 7-12), three give 3-year courses (grades 7-9), and three practical
schools train farmers and low-level agricultural technicians through a two-
year program of practical instruction. Enrollments in all were 800 in 1967;
the full secondary schools graduated 50. A forestry training center trains
sub-professional staff and provides special courses for agriculturists employed
in the forestry services.
Youth and Adult Education
2.14    A promising feature of the education system is the opportunity given
to working youths who have dropped out of the system to continue and complete
their studies in evening schools. Some 35 evening general secondary and 19
commercial and technical schools operate in day school buildings; enrollments
were 12,000 with 800 graduates in 1966.
2.15    The Ministry of Social Service and Labor administers a vocational
training school at second cycle level,sponsored and staffed by the Federal
Republic of Germany. This well-equipped school with 95 students is setting
high standards of craftsmanship; the graduates are in immediate demand by

industry. Another center, with an enrollment of 120, administered by the
tlinistry of Defence, provides intensive one-year courses in general mechanics
and auto-mechanics. The school aims at meeting military needs and at
helping soldiers about to be discharged to prepare for civilian life. This
school also sets high standards, and its output is in demand.
2.16    Since 1960 the Ministry of Education assisted by US AID has conducted
short courses for 13,300 workers in industry. This pioneer work will be of
great assistance to the Servicio Ecuatoriano de Capacitacion Profesional
(SECAP), a semi-autonomous organization created in 1966 to plnn, co-ordinate
and implement training programs for workers, supervisors, artisans, and smaU
businessmen. Utilization of appropriate facilities, existing and proposed, in
technical and other schools is an integral part of the SECAP plans.
2.17    A widely supported adult literacy program is receiving UNDP aid;
literacy skills are taught in conjunction with acquisition of elementary
work skills. New practical facilities in the reformed first cycle secondary
schools will prove invaluable to adequate implementation and extension of
the literacy program.
Higher Education
2.18    Enrollments in the seven universities, two polytechnics and five other
establishments of higher education have increased rapidly in the last decade
(Annexes 2 and 5). Over half of the students are enrolled in scientific and
technical disciplines. The faculties of education have more than doubled
their enrollments in the last 5 years.  Output of these faculties has
increased from 86 in 1962 to over 200 in 1966, with a possibility of 400
graduates in 1970. Furthermore, there has been a marked increase in the num-
bers of students preparing for mathematics and science teaching.
2.19    Agricultural education at the higher level is offered by five
agricultural and veterinary faculties (Annex 5). Assistance was obtained
from UNDP and the Inter-American Development Bank for strengthening the
agricultural faculties of Quito and Guayaquil, but there is no provision for
agricultural teacher-training in an  of the faculties.  Some teachers have
gone abroad for courses of a speciaized nature but not in agric urtura±
education proper.
Secondary Education Development Targets
2.20    The Ecuador Education Development Plan projects an enrollment of
250,000 in secondary level education in 1973-1974. However, unless restraint
is exercised, the mission calculates that enrollments could reach 335,000 in
1973-1974 and 400,000 in 1974-1975.  Such enrollments would place very heavy
demands on the national expenditures for education with little assurance that
the administrative and technical problems of such expansion could be solved
in time; well-conceived prograns for qualitative improvement would be frus-
trated. In addition, employment opportunities for graduates are unlikely to
increase at a proportionate rate (see para. 4.07).



- 6 -
2.21    If the secondary school system is to stay within manageable limits
the Government would have to restrict intake as from 1968. All calculations
in this report assume that such restrictions will be applied and consequent]y
estimated enrollments in secondary education in 1974-1975 would be 250,000
(Annex 6), with 180,000 in the first cycle and 70,000 in the second cycle, of
which89,000 and 35,000 respectively in public schools. Second cycle distri-
bution, after rationalization, by type of education is given in Annex 6 and
is consistent with the projected needs for the various types of graduates
(see para. 4.07).
2.22    Teacher supply:  Over-all qualified teacher demand and supply may be
summarized as follows:

Special short courses:                    2800            -         2800

4100         1600        570
2.23    For an enrollment of 250,000 in 1974 the equivalent of some 10,000
full-time teachers would be required. This would imply the introduction intc
the education system between 1968 and 1974 of the equivalent of some 5,700
new full-time qualified teachers. Average annual input requirement is there-
fore 800 qualified teachers. The universities are expected to reach an
annual output of 400 by 1970, with a total output of 2,350 between 1968 and
1974 giving an average annual output of 330 in the period. To supplement this
output, programs have been prepared jointly by the Ministry of Education and
the universities to train teachers specifically for the first cycle of second-
ary education in special courses of one and two years duration. These courses
will be provided for experienced but unqualified secondary school teachers and
for newcomers. The projected output of these special courses by 1974 is
2,800 or an annual output of 400. In total 5,150 qualified teachers would be
made available in the period 1968-74 leaving a deficit of 550 to be made good
by university graduates who have not been trained specifically for teaching.
The supply of such graduates has presented no problem in the past.
2.24    The supply is inadequate to the demand in the next two years but then
matches the annual demand and in the early seventies exceeds the annual demand
so that by 1974 some 70,C of the teaching force would be qualified as compared
with 18, in 1965.  The sppcci2 in-scrvico rnd prc-socrvi3c ahcrt

main effort is scheduled for preparation of teachers of mathematics, science
and industrial arts whorc tho main deficiencies lie, but additional prograzms
will be prepared to train toachers of agriculture, hone economics and handi-
crafts in the required numbers. Inauguration of the special training programs
cannot be delayed without jeopardizing the successful iLplementation of the
educational plan.
School Building in Ecuador
2.25    Construction: The quality of architectural design and building varies
considerably throughout the country and is best in Quito and Guayaquil where
the more competent professional and building services are concentrated. There
are no building by-laws, fire or health regulations. Some of the larger
municipalities have their own building laws but these are incomplete and anti-
quated.
2.26    Building materials are locally produced, but structur-1l steel, hard-
ware, sanitary and electrical fixtures and glass are imported. The building
industry has coped adequately with recent building activity and would not be
overloaded by additional business resulting from the proposed education project.
There are about 12 large construction firms situated in Quito and Guayaquil
with experience in comparatively large-sized projects including multi-storey
structures, and a large number of medium and small firms throughout the country.
There is no overall shortage of skilled and unskilled labor but skilled labor
is not evenly distributed.
2.27    Professional services: iResponsibility for design and execution of
public buildings rests with the client ministry or municipality. The design
and execution of the Ministry of Education school building program is now
handled by the ministry's own buildings' department which has a professional
staff of one architect, six engineers and part-time draughtsmen. The Ministry
of Agriculture technical office has one architect and two draughtsmen. The
supervision of Ministry of Education construction is carried out by six super-
visors who visit building sites irregularly. The Ministry of Agriculture
architect carries out the supervision of this ministry's construction work.
The two ministries are not adequately staffed to undertake execution of a
major project.
2.28    The country has a number of local architectural firms, concentrated
in the Quito and Guayaquil areas, working mainly for the private sector. At
present there are no foreign architectural firms established in Ecuador;
Government regulations require that foreign firms associate with a local firm.
Most of the firms of private architects operate with a small professional
staff but some have experience in school building design.
2.29    Impartation and Procurement: Importation and procurement of building
materials is the responsibility of the builders' merchant. Occasionally for
government projects the Government imports directly. Except in the case of
government projects, a heavy customs duty is imposed on imported raw and
finished material for building, fittings and equipment. Furniture and other
finished goods which are being manufactured in Ecuador may not be



- 8 -
imported by Government and related agencies, except where dispensation is
granted by the Minister of Industry and Commerce. This protection/prohibition
and high duty lead to unwarranted high costs for school furniture.
2.30    The tendering and contract award procedures: Government procedures
for tendering are satisfactory. With few exceptions, tendering is public
and the award of contracts rests with a special tenderst committee in which
the interested ministry is represented. Architects and engineers follow an
acceptable system of professional practice and procedures for contracts.
3. EDUCATION FINANCE
Present Expenditures
3.01    Total Ex  nditures: In 1966, total expenditure on education was
sucres 750 million cr 3.7 percent of the GDP, a considerable increase over
the 1961 level of 2.7 percent of GDP. Expenditures on education from Central
Government funds were only 66 percent of the 1966 total; 14 percent was spent
by the municipalities and by the educational institutions (universities and
secondary schools) from their own revenues (earmarked taxes, etc.); the re-
maining 20 percent represents expenditures of the private sector.
3.02    Structure of Expenditures:  During the period 1961-1966 the average
annual growth of Central Government recurrent expenditure on education was
16 percent (12 percent at constant prices), from sucres 229 million to sucres
490 million with the highest increase for technical and agricultural studies
(Chart 5). Of the sucres 490 million about 53 percent was spent on primary
education, 19 percent on general and commercial secondary education, 13
percent on higher education, 4 percent on teacher training, 3 percent on
technical and agricultural education (Annex 7). In 1966 expenditure per
student for school maintenance and materials was estimated at about sucres
1.5 in primary and averaged sucres 85 in secondary education. Such allocations
are totally inadequate.
3.03    In the same period 1961-1966, of the sucres 20 million average annual
capital expenditure, 45 percent went to primary education and 25 percent to
secondary education construction, and the remainder to equipment supply,
architectural studies, and higher education construction.
3.04    Foreign Aid:  Between 1962-1966, foreign aid committed to education
projects amounted to US $8 millions or about half the total cost of these
projects.  About US $5.5 million was granted by the UNDP for equipment,
technical assistance and scholarships for technical education (Escuela
Politecnica Nacional, Conocoto Forestry Training Center the Faculties of
Agronomy and Veterinary MIedicine in Quito and Guayaquil) and for the adult
literacy program. Unicef granted teaching aids for primary teacher training.
Germany has set up a technical institute under the Ministry of Social
Service and Labor and assisted a private technical school. The Netherlands
sponsored a training center in dairy farming. Two loans were made by the
Inter American Development Bank to the public universities of Quito and
Guayaquil for a total of US $1 million.  US AID contributed grants of
US $1.5 million for primary school construction; it has also provided
considerable technical assistance in teacher-training, textbooks and
instructional aids' production, and university re-organization.



- 9 -
3.05    The Government of Ecuador recently contracted with US AID for a loan
of US $5.3 million for the construction of 3,000 classrooms in primary
education, three teacher-training schools, the production of primary school
textbooks and the training of teachers and administrators for primary and
teacher-training schools. The total project cost is estimated at US $10
million.
3.06    In vocational training the government has presented a request to UNDP
for the organization and equipment of SECAP (para. 2.16). The total estimated
cost is US $2.2 million. With regard to technical assistance, the most
important new program involves US AID, the Organization of American States,
the Ministry of Education and the faculties of education in the preparation of
first cycle secondary school teachers (para. 2.22).
3.07    Private Cost of Education: Education is provided free of charge in
government schools except that an enrollment and examination fee of between
sucres 150-200 per year is charged by the secondary schools and boarding,
wherever available, costs about sucres 300 per month. Students pay for text-
books and sometimes for materials to be used in practical work. Fees charged
by private schools show wide variations.  To supplement these revenues, the
Government makes annual transfers to the denominational private schools which
reached in 1965 sucres 3.6 million. This support is likely to increase.
Financial Projections
3.08    Providing adequately for planned expansion of primary and secondary
education (paras. 2.06 and 2.21) would require a total capital expenditure
of sucres 730 million between 1967-1974 of which sucres 450 million would be
necessitated by the secondary school program - a much higher amount than
originally planned.  In arriving at this figure, it is assumed (i) that 15,000
of the projected enrollments in public general secondary and commercial
schools will be added without the construction of new places, and (ii) that
all new places in public secondary schools outside the project will be of the
same standard as the project school places. The total cost of the proposed
project represents 40 percent of the 1967-1974 investment needs in secondary
education. As a result, taking into account the US AID loan to primary
education, the Central Government would be expected to finance from its own
resources for all levels of education some sucres 70 million per year or twice
the average of the peak years 1964 and 1965 when it was sucres 34 million and
33 million respectively.
3.09    Central Government recurrent expenditures on education would increase
from sucres 490 million in 1966 to sucres 939 million by 1975 or by an average
of 7.5 percent per year to take care of increased enrollments alone, that is,
without quality improvement (Annex 7). Another 2½ percent per year would be
needed for qualitative improvements (higher proportion of qualified primary
teachers, full-time secondary teachers, increased expenditure on materials
and maintenance) and would bring the total to sucres 1,135 million. The cost
per student on which this estimate has been made is given in Annex 7.
3.10    Assuming that by 1975 recurrent expenditures are sucres 1,135 million
and capital erpenditures sucres 70 million per annum, the Central Government
would be spending on education about 26 percent of its expected current

4. MANPOWER AND EDUCATION
Relating the Education and Training System to the Economic needs
4.01    The Education Plan:  The Ecuador Education Plan (1964-1973) aims at
integrating education development with national development plans. The
objectives and the measures to achieve these are:
(a) Expansion and modernization of the secondary school system planned
to meet the projected needs for middle-level manpower and for entry to higher
education institutions which are to satisfy the professional level needs.
Ehrollment targets are some 250,000 in secondary schools by 1974 (para. 2.21).
Distribution of enrollments in the second or diversified cycle is given in
Annex 6. Modernization is to be effected by the introduction of new curricula
and improved facilities.
(b) Improvement of the efficiency of the system by ensuring higher
quality and increased output with proportionately smaller inputs than at
present. The modernization measures should improve quality. In additions
the secondary school system is to be re-structured so that vocationally-
biased courses begin in the second cycle. This should ensure selection of
students for the vocational courses who have real interest in and capacity for
these studies. Higher retention rates should result. Improved teacher-
training, pre-service and in-service, programs will support these developments.



- j1 -
(c) Restructuring -to facilitate consolidation of resources and
hence economies. Technical education is to be concentrated in eight,
agricultural education in four, teacher-training in 10 or 12 schools as
compared with 22, 16 and 38 respectively today. This program will ensure
availability of skilled teachers in the consolidated schools.  In the
general secondary school sector, the rationalization program entails the
conversion of small secondary schools into first cycle schools, amalgamation
of schools, and construction of new schools of an economic size.
4.02   Mlanpower Needs:  In projecting manpmoer needs by 1975, account was
taken of the government aim of nine years of education to all who seek it.
This implied raising the level of educational requirements for initial entry
into wage employment but otherwise no fundamental change in the existing
distribution of the work force by occupations and corresponding educational
requirements (Ann- 8).
4.03    In agriculture, the estimated need for "agronomos" with six years
secondary education is based on the findings of the 1965 CIDA (Inter-American
Committee for the Development of Agriculture) study. It takes into account
the additional needs, resulting from several recent foreign loans to agricul-
ture, for farm managers, agricultural credit supervisors and others with a
sound agricultural education base.
4.04    In industry, the estimated needs for skilled workers have been based
on the recent occupational trends in newly established enterprises and, after
cross-checking with major employers, development institutions and CENDES, the
productivity center.
4.05    Annual primary teacher needs by 1975 have been projected to meet the
requirements of an expected average annual increase in primary pupil enrollment
of about 60,000 between 1966-1974 and to raise the proportion of trained
teachers from 56% in 1966 to 70; of the total by 1974 (Annex 9). Among the
workers at professional level the education sector would absorb about half
the annual output of the universities as secondary school teachers.
4.06    All these projections are in line with the main characteristics of
today's labor market.  The graduates frcm efficient industrial and agricultur-
al training institutions are finding better employment opportunities and
higher initial remuneration or are setting up their own enterprises. The
number of applicants to these schools shows awareness of the situation. on
the other hand, the employment prospects of the graduates of the general
secondary schools will improve only if the education system makes them more
trainable for job opportunities.
4.07    The resulting projections of annual manpower needs by 1975 (Table
below, column 1) demonstrate that the education and training system should be
expanded to avoid a gap most critical in the areas of industrial and agricul-
tural middle level skills and primary teachers (column 3), but restraint
should be exercised in expansion of general and commercial secondary level
studies:

The Need for the Project
4.08    On the assumption that financial aid would be availables, Ecuador has
determined the priorities for implementation of the Education Plan to satisfy
economic needs. Priority is given to improving and expanding technical and
agricultural education and teacher-training facilities and to beginning implementa-
tion of the reforms in the first and second cycles of general secondary education
to provide a sounder base and serve as testing grounds for further curricula
development and other reforms. This approach is consistent with achievement of
longer-term strategic objectives (para. 4.01) and Ecuador has designed a project
in these terms. However, Ecuador needs financial assistance to implement the
program.

3/ Output at second cycle level of all project general secondary schools
5.02    Relation of the Project to the Needs:  A comparison of the output of
the project schools and the manpower demznd (para. 4.07) shows that the
proposed project is directed towards making an important contribution to
meeting middle-lovel manpcaor needs in agriculture, industry and education.
The output of the project schools forms 64%, 53% and 50% of the estimated
required total output in 1975 from agricultural, technical and teacher-training
schools respectively. Moreover, the enrollments and location of these schools
have been decided on the basis of the program for consolidation, hence economy,
of resources.
5.03    Expansion caused by the project in general secondary school enrollment
is limited to what is needed to provide places (i) for students displaced from
the first cycle of the project existing vocational schools on restructuring
of these schools, (ii) to make good the inadequacies of places in the two
major cities and the smaller capitals of the cantons and parishes, and
(iii) to meet the more urgent consolidation requirements (para. 4.01(c)).



- 14 -
5.04    However, the more significant impact or the proposed project is in
the improvement of the quality of the output.  The project schools can become
more efficient and more productive. Appropriate facilities with particular
emphasis on construction and equipment of workshops, laboratories, and other
practical teaching spaces (Annex 12) and provision of audio-visual teaching
aids makes possible the application of the reformed curricula by qualified
teachers.  The learning situation will be improved by the adequacy of the
physical facilities; the proposed schedules of accommodation are consistent
with the enrollment structure given in Annex 13 which are to be adhered to
so that the schools may function effectively. This does not exclude the
possibility of maximising use of these facilities by operation of some form
of shift' system, or other measures as practicable. In addition, evening
school education and out-of-school training given by such organizations as
SECAP can be improved and expanded by using the project school resources.
5.05    To ensure that the quality of the project schoolst output is improved
to the greatest possible extent, the government has undertaken (i) to staff
the project schools with qualified teachers who devote their full time to the
schools, and (ii) to appoint to the project schools qualified and experienced
directors.
5.06    Student Population:  Total enrollment in the project schools would
be 19,600 of which 13,100 would be additional to enrollment in existing
project schools. Intake for the schools is assured since the projected output
of primary education is more than adequate (para. 2.20 and 2.21), and output
from the first cycle secondary greater than the required input into all second
cycle secondary schools including the project schools (Annex 6). In addition,
there is an ever-increasing demand for places in the vocational schools.
5.07    Hostels and staff Housing: As the agricultural, technical and teaclher-
training schools are to recruit throughout the country, a total additional
hostel accommodation for 1,200 is required in nine of the schools (Annex 10).
The heaviest concentration of hostel Dlaces will be at the agricultural
schools because of their comparative remoteness, and because of the nature of
the school program.  For the same reason, and in order to attract teachers,
these schools are provided with staff housing.
5.08    Locations and Sites:  The location of the project schools accords with
the geographic distribution of the population (see *iap) and the principle of
centralization of facilities enunciated in the education development plan.
Twenty-one of the 28 required sites are available and are satisfactory. The
government has agreed, by September, 1969, to:
(i) formally acquire the sites already selected for project items
Nos. 10, 152 16, 22 (Annex 10);
(ii)  select and acquire sites for items Nos. 1h4  17, and 26;

Elements of the Project
5.09    The agricultural schools:  A recent study by the Ecuador Government
and UNDP concluded that training of sub-professional agricultural technicians
should be concentrated in a small number of schools offering a 3-year
course at the upper secondary level. The study stressed the need for these
schools to be supplied with the necessary physical facilities and with
well-trained teachers. The four agricultural schools in the project are to
implement this reform. Each school will enroll 300 students for an annual
output of 80 technicians. The curriculum will be balanced with general and
technical subjects as well as with farm and workshop practice. Instruction
will be job-oriented and also adapted to the farming patterns prevailing in
each region. The trainees should thus be able to apply their knowledge in
the region where they studied and also to adapt it to different environments.
iMost of the trainees are expected to be directly employed either in the
Government services or in the private sector, but some exceptionally capable
students may follow higher studies.
5.10    The project provides the academic facilities, instructional and farm
equipment to ensure an effective education and training program. Effective
implementation demands the services of two experienced agricultural education
specialists to advise on curriculum and school administration, and to organize
and conduct pre- and in-service training courses in the preparation of
teaching materials, the use of effective teaching methods, and the supervision
of student projects and farm practice. There are sufficient professional
agriculturists teaching but all lack preparation as teachers. Teacher
training should become an organic function of the agricultural faculties,
and these faculties should help both formal agricultural teaching and
extension education for the farm population.
5.11    The technical schools:  Technical industrial education is to be
concentrated in six public and two private schools; four of the public
schools are included in the project. The new project school at Quito will
replace an existing technical school which will become a first cycle
secondary school. The three project schools at Guayaquil, Ambato and Manta
require additional facilities, re-equipment and some conversions. The schools
will offer courses in general mechanics, auto-mechanics, electrical installa-
tion and electronics. The curricula have an acceptable balance between
general, workshop and related subjects - 27%p 45% and 28% respectively -
and are job-oriented. The more able students could, with additional private
study, qualify themselves for university entrance. It is proposed to esta-
blish formal links with industry and relate course content to local needs.
The premises in the evenings would be available for accelerated courses for
workers in the manufacturing and construction industries.
5.12    Estimated requirements for skilled technical workers are 2,000 per
annum by 1975. The eight technical schools together would provide an output
of 1,370, including the four project schools (720), as compared 'with the
present 250 from 22 schools. It is expected that the German-Ecuadorian
technical school, the military school and the up-grading program of SEGAP
will meet the deficit.



- 16 -
5.13    Consolidation of technical education facilities will release the
best teachers of the existing 22 schools for employment in the selected
smaller group of schools including the four project schools so that the
teacher supply is assured. Refresher and up-grading courses for these
teachers are in hand.
5.14    The teacher-training schools:  The annual output of trained teachers
must be increased from the present 1,460 to 2,000 by 1972 to meet the needs of
an enrollment of 1,274,000 in the primary schools in 1974, and to raise the
proportion of trained teachers in the force from 56% to 70 (Annex 9).
Improvement of the quality of the output is as important as the expansion.
This will be effected through concentration of resources and application of the
reformed curriculum.
5.15    The five project schools, together with three schools to be con-
structed or modernized by the US AID, form the main part of the proposed
centralization scheme of teacher-preparation. The project schools would have
an annual output of 1,000 qualified teachers, half the total requirement.
5.16    The reformed curriculum blends academic with practical and profession-
al studies. Teaching practice sessions are introduced in the last two years
when the students have the maturity to function adequately. The schools will
be equipped and staffed to assure better learning conditions, hence better
quality output. Concentration of the best teacher-trainers in a few schools
ensures an adequate supply of qualified teacher-trainers. In addition, the
universities, with US AID assistance, have organized upgrading courses for
teacher-trainers.
5.17    The general secondary schools:  Projected enrollments in the 15
project schools of 10,400 at the first cycle and 2,240 at the second cycle
would constitute 6 percent and 5 percent respectively of the projected
enrollments in these levels of general secondary education in 1974. The
projected maximum output is 2,920 from the first cycle and 660 from the
second cycle. The project contributes modestly to the expansion program in
this type of education (para. 5.03); its main objective is improvement of the
quality of the graduate by promoting in the schools the appropriate teaching
conditions for the application of more modern and balanced curricula.
5.18    In the first cycle, the curriculum has been revised to include
practical work - industrial arts, home economics, handicrafts and agriculture -
as an integral part of general education. In the second cycle, the sciences
and mathematics are emphasized in one stream, social studies in the other.
The majority of students in the second cycle will follow the maths-science
course and consequently improve the input into the technical faculties of the
universities.
5.19    Teacher requirements of the project schools are given in Annex 14.
Output of the schools of education assures an adequate supply of teachers for
the second cycle. The project first cycle could be staffed with qualified
teachers only by depriving other general secondary schools of their best
teachers. Consequently, staffing of the project first cycle should remain
dependent on the arrangements made for the total system. The needs can be



- 17 -
met provided the program for preparation of first cycle secondary school -
teachers commences operation at the latest by September, 1968 (paras. 2.22-
2.24).
5.20    Technical Assistance:  The Iinistries of Education and Agriculture
will need expert advisers to assist in the detailed programming of the reform
plan (para. 4.01), and more specifically to help in the on-the-job training
of the directors and staff of the project schools. The specialists required
are:
(i)  three specialists in school administration and organization -
one for general secondary education, one for technical education
and one for agricultural education. These three specialists
would devote most of their time to counselling the directors and
staff of the project schools, and training their counterparts
in the techniques of supervision;
(ii)  two specialists, one in technical and one in agricultural
education, to assist with the rationalization programs and with
the teacher-training courses;
(iii)  one specialist in secondary teacher-training to assist with the
teacher-training programs.
5.21    These six specialists should be on post in September, 1968 for a
period of four years. Ecuador will be able to obtain some of this assistance
from bilateral and international sources and possibly by appropriate recruiting
in Ecuador. However, in case difficulties are met, the cost of three special-
ists is included in the project, that is, 12 man-years at a total cost of
$300,000.
5.22    The Project Unit:  Since this unit would be involved in the implementa-
tion of the project, it is described under "Implementation" at para. 5.32
below.
Cost of the Project
5.23    The total estimated cost of the project is sucres 185 million or
US $10.2 million equivalent; the estimated foreign ecchange component is
US $4.5 million or approximately 44t% of the total cost. The analysis of this
cost by type of educational facility provided is given in Annex 11. By major
category of expenditure, 44p/O of the total cost is for construction (38% for
teaching administration areas, 5% for boarding facilities and 1lo for staff
quarters), 5% for site development, 9% for furniture, 19% for equipment,
5% for professional fees and project unit costs, and 3% for technical assist-
ance (Annex 11). Contingencies account for 15%. The government of Ecuador
is providing the sites; their cost is not included in the estimate of project
costs.
5.24    The construction cost estimates have been derived from recent building
experience and are based upon gross buildings costs per square meter in Quito.
Each category of building was analyzed and the costs adjusted to take account
wherever pertinent of modifications, completions and necessary improvements.
A local cost adjustment factor has been introduced to compensate for variations
in the costs at different locations in the country.



- 18 -
5.25    The recent increase of about 4 percent per annum in building costs
may be expected to continue and consequently a total price increase allow-
ance of 12 percent has been included in the project construction costs. A
further 10 percent has been introduced for unforeseen site development and
construction costs. A similar provision of 15% is made to cover possible
increase in the cost of furniture and equipment. Consolidated, contingencies
thus form 15 percent of the total costs.
5.26    Schedules of accommodation follow economic space standards and are
consistent with functional needs. Average capital costs (excluding contin-
gencies and professional services) per student place are considered reasonable
at $325 for a first cycle secondary place, $300 for a general secondary
school with both first and second cycles, $300 for a teacher-training place,
$850 for a technical school place, $450 for a hostel place.
5.27    Equipment and furniture lists for all the schools have been reviewed
and are satisfactory. Estimated costs are reasonable.
5.28    Additional recurrent expenditures generated by the project schools in
1974-1975 would be sucres 46 million or 4 percent of the education recurrent
budget. Ecuador should be able to meet these expenditures and also its share
of the capital expenditures of the proposed project.
Implementation
5.29    Standardization: The climatological conditions in the Sierra and
the Costa regions in all project school locations make a unified design
approach possible in each region. The Government intends to standardize the
basic building components as far as practicable for the entire project,
to take advantage of mass production, modular coordination and buying in
quantity.
5.30    Bidding and Awards: The government will follow international bid-
ding procedures for the construction of the schools in the proposed project
and for the supply of the equipment and furniture. To attract good bids,
facilitate construction work and supervision, and to effect economies in cost
and time: (i) tenders for construction will form sizable bid packages each
made up of schools grouped on a geographical basis, for example as illustrated
in Chart 6; (ii) furniture and equipment tenders will be grouped for bulk
purchase with delivery schedules fixed.
5.31    Maintenance: The Government has given assurances that the recurrent
expenditure budgets for the project schools will contain annual allocations for
maintenance on a graduated scale rising from 1% of the construction cost one
year after the completion of construction of a school to 1.5% five years
later, as well as provisions for efficient operation of the schools. The
Building Department of the Ministry of Education and the technical office of
the lMnistry of Agriculture will be responsible for the regular inspection
and repair of project school premises, furniture and equipment.



- 19 -
5.32    Project Unit:  Throughout the period of disbursement, the Ministry of
Education will maintain a special administrative unit to initiate, co-ordinate
and supervise all aspects of implementation of the project. It will be
headed by a project director assisted by a project architect or engineer, an
educationist, and a qualified accountant, all acceptable to IDA. The unit
will be provided with such ancillary staff as may be necessary, including
supervisors of works. The costs of this unit are estimated at $280,000 over
the four year period required for completion of the project. The Ministry of
Agriculture education department and construction unit will be consulted in all
matters pertaining to construction and equipping of the project agricultural
schools.
5.33    Professional Services:  The design and supervision of the proposed
project are beyond the capacity of the ministries' technical services. The
Government willp therefore, employ local architectural consultant firm(s)
acceptable to mA and on terms and conditions to be approved by IDA. As none
of the local firms as constituted at present is big enough to cope adequately
alone with execution of the design work of the project, it may be necessary
for two or more of these small firms to form a consortium. The consultant
firm(s) will be responsible also for supervision and for the certification
of contractors' bids. It is reconmended that the consultants selected should
also prepare standard drawings for school furniture.
Disbursements
5.34    An IDA credit of US $5.1 million would represent 50% of the total
estimated project cost. It wiould cover the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent of US $4.5 million and 10% of local costs.  The government would cover
through budgetary appropriations the balance of funds necessary to complete
the project.
5.35    IDA would disburse or reimburse (i) 100% of foreign exchange costs for
equipment and technical assistance, (ii) civil works and costs of the project
unit on a percentage basis and (iii) furniture on a percentage basis if
procured locally or the entire foreign exchange costs if imported. In case of
a change in the total cost of the project, these percentages would be adjusted,
by agreement, in order to spread disbursements throughout the construction
period, and to the extent practicable to maintain an average contribution of
50% by IDA towards the total cost of the project. The funds would be disbursed
over a four-year period (Annex 15 and Chart 6).

6. CONCLUSIONS AID RECOiM9DATIONS
6.01    The proposed project is intended to reinforce and accelerate
implementation of a priority program of secondary school improvement and
expansion closely related to national economic and social development plans
(paras. 4.01, 4.07).  It would be of special significance in meeting middle-
level manpower requirements of industry, agriculture and education (para. 5.02).
6.02    The proposed project would provide the facilities now lacking for
introduction of modern curricula and teaching techniques, and for a more
rational deployment of resources (paras. 5.o2-5.o4). The revised curricula
to be applied in the project schools are well balanced and consistent with the
objectives of the schools (paras. 5.09, 5.11, 5.16, 5.18).
6.03    The proposed project would thus improve the quality of the intake into
and output of the secondary schools, and increase the productivity of the
system (para. 5.04). The required intake into the first cycle and second
cycle schools is assured and the output can be absorbed (paras. 4.07, 5.06).
6.O4    The 21 available sites are satisfactory; acquisition proceedings
remain to be completed for seven more (para. 5.08).  The location of the
schools accords with the population distribution (see Map) and with priorities
established by the rationalization programs.
6.05    School design, schedules of accommodation, equipment and furniture
lists are adequate, and estimated costs are reasonable (paras. 5.04 5.26,
5.27). Procurement procedures will be in accord with Bank/IDA guidelines
Wpara. 5.30).
6.06    The establishment of a well-staffed project unit will assure efficient
execution of the project (para. 5.32).
6.07    It is within the capacity of the country to meet its share of the
project costs and the recurrent expenditures generated by the project (paras.
3.10, 5.28).
6.08    During negotiations the Government representatives gave assurances
on the following matterst
(i)  appointment of an experienced architectural firm(s), acceptable
to IDA, as consultant architects (para. 5.33);
(ii)  acquisition of unacquired sites by September 30, 1969 (para. 5.08);
(iii)  maintenance of secondary education enrollment in public schools
at planned targets as far as is possible (para. 2.21);
(iv) adherence to the enrollment structure of the project schools on
the lines given in Annex 13 (para. 5.04);



- 21 -
(v)  commencement of the secondary teacher-training in-service and
pre-service programs at latest by September, 1968 (paras. 2.24,
5.19);
(vi)  appointment of appropriately qualified directors and teachers to
the project scliools on a full-time basis (para. 5.05), and
appointment of the three experts not included in the project
cost (para. 5.21).
6.09    The project provides a suitable basis for a credit of US $5.1 million
for 50 years, including a grace period of 10 years.

Aiming at these targets implies:
(i)    Controlling enrollment in 1968 in Grade 7 equivalent to 60.:: of primary school output from the present 84%, and in 1969
dropping if to the equivalent of 50% of primary output.
(ii)   Controlling enrollment in second cycle -to about 80% of first cycle output in 1972.
