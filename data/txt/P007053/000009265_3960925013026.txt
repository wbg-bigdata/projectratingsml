PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1459-EC)
PREFACE
This is the Project  Completion  Report (PCR) for the Agricultural
Credit I Project (Loan 1459-EC), carried  out by the Project Executing Unit
(PU) within the Ministry of Agriculture  (MAG)  in  Ecuador.  The loan was
approved by the Board on June  14,  1977, for an amount of US$15.5 million,
and was fully dlsbursed by October 20, 1985.
The PCR was  prepared  by  the  Latin America  and the Caribbean
Regional Office, Agricultural Division C, after a completion mission to
Ecuador in February 1986. The PCR is also based on a special report and
data prepared by the Borrower, the Staff Appraisal Report (Report No.
1499-EC), the President's Report (Report No. P-2098-EC), the Loan Agreement
dated November 3, 1977, supervision reports, and correspondence with the
Borrower. Interual Bank memoranda on project issues were also reviewed.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower for comments on February 25, 1988 and none were were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1459-SnC)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives
The Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1459-EC) was designed to
support the Government's objective  to increase agricultural output through
expansion into new areas and increased productivity, thereby improving
economic and socisl conditions in rural areas and increasing rutral
employment. To meet this objective, the Bank loaned US$15.5 million,
mainly to provide financial support to public and private banks for lending
oper ttions in livestock development, on-farm investments, small local
agroindustries, and agricultural consulting  services.    In addition, the
Bank loan supported -nlied research on agricultural production, and the
institutional development of the Project Unit (PU), the Cooperative Bank
and selected cooperatives (paras. 2.02-2.03).
Implementation Experience
The project was executed between 1978 and 1985, and was twice
extended. Extensions were necessary due to disbursement delays caused
mainly by the Government's inability to provide adequate counterpart funds
on a timely basis. The problem of counterpart funds was the central issue
affecting the execution of the project, followed by the poor level of
management by the PU (para. 3.02).
Despite  these  problems,  the   project  objective  to  increase
agricultural output was met.   Subloans  for  livestock production (712 of
project investments) had a positive impact and although productivity
increases were smAll,  there wa   a  significant  increase  in the area of
improved pastures and the total number of herds. However, productivity
increaser. were only marginal.   Conversely, the impact on crop production
was minor as the areas under production only increased marginally. Because
of inadequate records, the project's incremental impact on farmer's incomes
was not determined. Applied research under the project was particularly
successful in pasture development for the Amazon Region. However, the
project was unsuccessful in the area of institutional development. The PU
did not utilize the majority of funds provided for its development,
performed badly, and was eventually  terminated.  The Cooperative Bank and
the selected cooperatives also failed to take up the component provided for
their nstitutional strengthening (paras. 4.01-4.03).



-v v
Sustainability
The sustainability of the productive component of the project,
large-scale farmers engaged in beef and dairy production, appears to be
good as these types oZ farmers and their activities are viable. The
institutional strengthening of the National Development Bank has enabled it
to upgrade its accounting and record keeping to banking standards. The
institutional .trangthening of the project unit and the Cooperative Bank
did not take place.   The  development  of crop agriculture for small-scale
farmers is not sustainable.
Findinzs and Lessons
Several findings and lessons emerge from this project experiences
(a)   The PU consistently  showed  the  project  to  be fully committed;
however, the majority of the outstanding commitments h&d been
financed  from  other  sources  of   funds.    The  problems  were
aggravated by the deteriorating relationship between the Ministry
of Agriculture, the National Development Bank, BNF, and the PU.
At the end of December 1984, the project was 701 disbursed and was
incorrectly shown as being fully committed (para. 3.02).
(b)   While  credit  to  small   farmers   amounted   to  251  of  total
agricultural credit, compated to 302 allocated at appraisal, the
actual amount disbursed (US$3 million) surpassed the appraisal
amount by  14X,  as  a  result  of  reallocations  from unutilizei
agroindustries, technical assis.sance and unallocated funds for
modium- and large-farmers. BNF was by far the most active agent
in lending to small farmers. It delivered 791 of the total number
of subloans representing 64Z of the total amount loaned (para.
3.06).
(c)   While at appraisal, it was  expected  that subborrowers would pay
real  positive  interest  rates,   interest  rates  became  highly
negative from 1983 onwards. Due to local legal constraints, no
provisions were made in the subloans legal documents for interest
rate readjustments, causing the decapitalization of the loan
portfolio (para. 3.11).
(d)   BNF's responsiveness  to  the  bank's  critictss  of  its internal
control, accounting and auditing procedures helped to influence it
to become a much improved credit institution (parsa. 5.04-5.05).
(e)   Becauee of its inadequate  performance,  the  PU was terminated in
mid-January  1985,  and  BNF was  given  the  responsibility  for
completing the project (paras. 5.01-5.02).
(f)   Private financial  institutions  will  lose  their  interest  in a
project if counterpart funds are not ensured for discounting
(para. 7.02).



- vi -
(g)   Adequate financial  management  is  a  prime  requirement  for *11
credit-related projects (para. 7.02).
(h)   Institutions included for project  participation should first have
an understanding of the project and be committed to it (e*g.,
Cooperative Bank) (para. 7.02).



ECUADOR
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT - LOAN 1459-EC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1983, Ecuador's agricultural sector accounted for about 12% of
GDP and 35% of export earni ngs compared to 33% of GDP and 90% of export
earnings in 1970. While the decline in agriculture was due mainly to the
discovery and export of petroleum, agriculture (except for livestock,
forestry and shrimp production) grew slowly from 1970 to the mid-1980s, with
no substantial increase shown in the average yields of major crops. The
growth rate of real value-added for the major export crops during this
period-bananas, coffee, and cocoa--was about 1.7% per annum, with other
traditional crops growing at only 0.6% per annum, well below the population
growth rate of 2.5%. However, the picture in the livestock subsector from
1974 to 1984 was better, as the area under pastures increased by 53%, with an
annual average increase in meat of 3.5% and milk of 2.9%. At the same time,
poultry, meat and egg production increased by over 20% per year, and pig
production by over 5%.
1.02      Since 1984, the new Government has introduced a developmenL program
more supportive of agriculture which is designed to (a) raise farm prices;
(b) progressively eliminate consumer and producer subsidies; (c) achieve
realistic exchange rates; (d) introduce variable positive and unified
interest rates; (e) emphasize import substitution and export expansion;
(f) strengthen agricultural support services; and (g) reduce Government
intervention and generally improve the terms of trade for agriculture.
1.03      At end-December 1985, the total outstanding credit of the finencial
sytitem to agriculture production amounted to about US$576 million, of which
882 was outstanding to the Government-owned National Development Bank (BNF);
the remaining 12% was outstanding to the private banks, Including the
Cooperative Bank (CB) and financial coorporations.  Agricultural lending
during the past ten years has increased by an average of about 7% per annum
in real terms, with medium- and long-term credit accounting for about 35%.
Much of the agricultural subloan portfolio made by the financial institutions
are discounted by the Central Bank from special petroleum-generated and other
funds, and Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loans. The Bank,
in supporting the Government's agricultural development program has so far
financed through the Central Bank, three livestock development loans (a total
of US$15.3 million) and the first agricultural credit loan (US$15.5 mil-
lion).  The projects supported b: these loans were managed by a Project
Executing Unit (PU) within the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG). In addition to
providing resources, the Bank has supported applied research and technical
assistance, mainly related to pasture and livestock development.
1.04      The Monetary Board, which is set up by the Government, sets
policies related to interest rates, exchange rates, credit, reserves and



deposits. The Central Bank implements, and the Superintendency of Banks
monitors, controls and audits the Banking system.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The project was prepared by the PU as a continuation of the Dsnk's
assistance to livestock development, emphasizing lending to small producer",
and diversifying by providing credit for crops and the development of
agroindustries. The project was managed by the PU, with the National Center
for the Promotion of Small and Artisan Industries (CENAPIA) having a
secondary responsibility for agroindustries subprojects.  While Project
Completion Reports (PCRs) showed the previous projects as being successful in
Improving productivity and output on participating ranches, they noted
(a) the lack of a monitoring system and (b) the negative Impact arising from
subsidized interest rates. Also, the latest PCR (Credit 222-EC) referred to
inadequate accounting and auditing in the PU, and serious deficiencies in the
accounts and internal control of BNF, the principal participating bank.
Objectives and Description
2.02      The project was designed to support the Government's objective of
increasing agricultural output by expansion into new areas and increased
productivity, thereby Improving econom:.c and social conditions in rural areas
and increasing rural employment. Specifically, the project was to
(a) provide agricultural credit resources; (b, assist the development of farm
enterprise management; (c) support applied research for farm and pasture
development; and (d) provide technical assistance for the institutional
development of the CB and selected cooperatives, the PU, CENAPIA, and
participating MAG extension services.
2.03      The Bank loan of US$15.5 million was to finance the estimated
foreign exchange cost (432) of the project. The remainder of the project
was to be financed by Government counterpart funds (24%), participating banks
(16X) and producers (17x). At least 30% of the agricultural funds were
allocated to small producersl/. The credit resources were to finance
livestock development, crop Tarms in selected areas, agroindustries, and
agricultural consulting services.
Appraisal and Negotiations
2.04      At appraisal, the mission noted the National Development Bank's
(BNF's) poor financial position, poor internal control, the need for stronger
and more qualified auditors, and its poor relationship with the PU. However,
the Bank was assured that BNF was undergoing the required institutional
reforms; as a result, it desired greater autonomy under the project. It was
agreed that there would be a gradual delegation of authority for subloan
approval away from the PU to BNF and the private financial institutions,
provided the institutions' operations were satisfactory to the Bank. For
interest rates, Ecuador's Monetary Board permitted a revision of rates
substantially upwards; In 1979 inflation was 102, compared to interest rates
of 112 to small producers and 142 to others.
1/ Small farmers were defined as those with net assets under US$20,000,
excluding their housing.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The loan was approved in June 1977, signed in November 1977, and
became effective in June 1978. The delay was associated with the fulfillment
of the conditions of effectiveness and bureaucratic hurdles in the
Government. The estimated project completion date of end-June 1982 was
extended twice, and completion was not until end-December 1984; the loan
closed at the end of September 1985.
Disbursements
3.02      The delay of over two years in loan disbursement was due mainly to
the Government's inability to provide counterpart funds for discount through
the Central Bank on a timely basis (Annex 1). As a result, the participating
banks lost interest in the project.  Also, when funds did become available,
disbursements were slow, since the PU failed to advise the participating
financial institutions and to monitor for the speedy processing of
documents. For several periods, the PU showed the project to be fully
committed, when the majority of the outstanding commitments had been financed
from other sources and should have been cancelled. These problems were
f.rther aggravated by the deteriorating relationship between MAG, BNF, and
the PU. Also, the uncertainty of the status and future role of the PU
demoralized its staff, which lost interest in the speedy completion of the
project. As a result of the ineffectiveness of the PU, the new Government
terminated it in mid-January 1985, and BNF was given the responsibility for
the project's completion. At end-December 1984 the project had been 70%
disbursed, and BNF reported that the loan was fully committed. However,
because of the PU's lack of cooperation in the handing over of records and
project documents to BNF, the Bank extended the normal disbursement period
after project completion from six to nine months.
Reallocation of Funds
3.03      There were two major reallocations:  the first in November 1981 to
transfer  US$1.6 million from the non-performing agroindustries componenc to
agricultural credit; and the second in December 1983 to transfer unallocated
funds (US$2 million) and unutilized technical assistance funds (US$800,000)
to agricultural credit.  A final adjustment was made at the end of the
project to reflect remaining over- and under-disbursements (Annex 2).
Project Cost and Financing
3.04      The project cost of S/ 2,097 million (Annex 3) was more than twice
that estimated at appraisal (S/ 900 million), mainly due to the devaluation
of the sucres during the project period, The project was financed by the
Bank (42%), Government counterpart funds (24%), participating banks (17%),
and producers (17%). The Bank's funds were disbursed at an average of S/ 57
to US$1, compared to the appraisal estimate of S/ 25 to US$1.
3.05      As anticipated, the project was mainly a continuation of the
previous livestock project, with 71% of investments going to livestock
production, and 15% to crops (Annex 3a). The large number of crop loans
(1,000) which was estimated at appraisal was replaced by fewer and larger
loans (87). This change in composition was influenced by the higher delivery



- 4 -
cost to smal2 farmers, and the lower than planned participation of the
cooperatives. The agroindustries component declined significantly, and while
the number of subloans increased, agroindustrial investments only amounted to
6% of total investments compared to 26% estimated at appraisal. This ceecline
was mainly due to the poor performance of CENAPIA and the lack of counterpart
funds to finance the larger investments required for agroindustries.
3.06      While credit to small farmers amounted to 25% of total credit,
compared to 30% allocated at appraisal, the allocated amount at appraisal
(US$2.6 million) was surpassed as a result of reallocations from agro-
industries to medium and large farmers (para. 3.03). Also, as private
financial institutions were much more concerned with lending to medium and
large farmers, the small farmer component got off to a slow start. BNF was
by far the most active financial institution in lending to the small farmers,
delivering 79% of the total number of subloans, representing 64% of the total
amount loaned. The majority of subloans were maae to the Sierra region
(highlands). Annex 3b summarizes agricultural credit by beneficiaries,
regions, and financial institutions.
Technical Support
3.07      The technical support components of the project were only about 60%
utilized (Annex 3a). Technical support had been provided for (a) applied
research by the National Agriculrtral Research Institute (INIAP);
(b) institutional development for the CB and about ten selected cooperatives;
and (c) the institutional development of the PU. INIAP's reduced use of the
funds allocated was due mainly to the lack of the Government's timely
approval for the hiring of external consultants. However, INIAP carried out
a good research program for the development of pastures and legumes, and crop
rotation. Their main achievement related to the development of technology
suitable to the fragile ecology of the Amazon region, which would improve the
income of the established farmers and new settlers. Preliminary indications
were that a mixed-farming system based on livestock production would be
sustainable in the local environment and would provide a reasonable level of
income. The CB and the cooperatives did not utilize the funds allocated, as
they failed to provide a satisfactory program for institutional development
and refused to carry out an evaluation of their operations, as was required.
The CB thought that the funds were a grant, without any requirement for
repayment. The PU utilized less than 20% of the funds allocated to them, and
failed to engage short-term consultants for crop development, marketing
services and agroindustrial support, and an internationally recruited
financial advisor, as was required. At first, the Government failed to
provide the necessary approval for these consultants; later, when approval
was received, the PU claimed incorrectly that the advisor was no longer
necessary, as the project was fully committed.
3.08      Because technical support funds were available, and there was the
need for agricultural research and development in the poor province of Loja
and in the Amazon region, the Bank agreea to provide financial support to the
University of Loja and the Technical College of Chimborazo. Both programs
were considered by the Bank to be project-oriented, well-designed, and aimed
at developing a stable and productive land use system in these highly fragile
areas. The program included the selection, establishment and persistence of
tropical pastures and legumes.



-5-
3.09      While no funds were provided in the project for extension services,
the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) was required to provide extension support
services to smallholder borroiers. However, Bank supervision missions noted
that MAG's technical advice and assistance was frequently inadequate and did
not meet the standards envisaged at appraisal.
Sublending Terms and Conditions
3.10      Supervision missions noted that subloan evaluacion procedures were
of good technical quality. However, the procedures for approval,
disbursement, and Central Bank discounting were slow and cumbersome. Also,
the transfer of subloan approval to the participating financial institutions
was not carried out until the final year of the project. At end-1984, about
21% of loans falling due were in arrears to the financial institutions, equal
to less than 2% of the outstanding balances. As outstarding subloans are
automatically recuperated on due dates by the Central Bank, the outstanding
balances are entirely the responsibility of the participating financial
institutions.
3.11      At appraisal it was expected that subborrowers would pay positive
interest rates. However, interest rates became negative in 1983 when
inflation rose above normal levels (the 1984 inflation rate was 48%). No
provision was made in the loan documents for the automatic adjustment of
rates linked to inflation or any other indicator, and adjustments made by the
Monetary Board were significantly below the inflation rates.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.12      As a requirement of the project, the PU developed a special
department and system for the evaluation of its subprojects. However, with
the termination of the PU at end-1984, the records of the department
disappeared, leaving no information relating to the subprojects monitored.
Compliance with Loan Conditions
3.13      Subloan conditions were generally net, except that the Government
failed to provide on a timely basis the counterpart funds necessary for the
project. In addition, under the technical support component, it failed to
provide the necessary and timely approval to engage expatriate staff and
consultants for INIAP and the PU.
.          Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
3.14      Project financial accounts were maintained by the Central Bank and
the PU, and were audited annually by the Superintendent of Banks.  The audit
reports (received up to end-1984) showed that the accounts were reasonably
well maintained, and that the project funds were properly accounted for.
However, the management accounting records maintained by the PU to monitor
project implementation were fNequently inaccurate and lacked adequate
guidance. The records show that management consistently failed to update the
status of committed subloans or to adjust for the changes in the rates of
exchange between the commitment dates and disbursement dates. Project
reports were submitted to the Bank on a timely basis until mid-1984, after
which their submission became irregular.

IV. PROJECT IMPACT
4.01      The project's impact is based on an ex-post evaluation of a weak
sample derived from 88 subprojects financed between 1979 and 1982. The
sample showed that subloans financed had a positive Impact on production. In
particular, the livestock subsector which accounted for 71% of the
investments financed: (a) improved pastures rose from 37% to 50% of the
total area; (b) the number of cattle rose dramatically (152% in the
highlands, 128% in the Coast, and 268% in the Amazon); and (c) carrying
capacity rose for beef operations in the coast from 1 A.U. up to 1.5 A.U. per
hectare.   However, productivity coefficients indicated that management and
technical activities did not improve significantly. For example, mortality
rates in beef operations rose from 5% to 8% and in dairy operations from 10%
to 14%; milk production increases were modest, rising on a per hectare basis
from 1,600 to 1,900 liters per ha. The conclusions, based on the above
coefficients, are that the level of management was not good and that
technical assistance and veterinary support services to subborrowers were
inadequate.
4.02      While increased crop production for small farmers was a key
objective of the project, the project had little impact in this activity.
Under the project, annual crops only rose from 5.6% to 6.72 of the area
financed, and perennial crops only rose from 3.52 to 4.1%. There were no
records available to demonstrate comparative yields, but it was clear that
crop production received only minor attention.
4.03      Because of the lack of project records, in particular comparative
baseline data, it was impossible to determine the projects' incremental
impact on farmers' incomes. However, a comparison of current farm modele of
similar investment types show financial rates of return ranging from 30% to
37%, compared to the project's estimates of 192 for livestock operations and
26% for crops. Economic rates of return in current models range from 332 to
38%, compared to an average of 18% estimated at appraisal.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Project Unit (PU)
5.01      While the PU sacisfactorily completed the previous Livestock Credit
Project (Loan 222-EC), the Bank noted that its accounting arrangements
required strengthening, and consequently provided in the project for the
engagement of an expatriate financial/credit adviser. However, this adviser
was not engaged because (a) Government approval was delayed for over two
years; and (b) when approval was received, the PU submitted that the project
was fully committed and the adviser no longer required. It was unfortunate
that the adviser was not engaged, as the lack of adequate financial and
administrative leadership was reflected in the poor performance of the PU.
The PU was unable to efficiently deal with the problems arising from the lack
of counterpart funds, e.g., its inability to (a) initiate strong
intermediation with the Government and the Central Bank; (b) accelerate the
movement of documentation for discount and subsequent Bank reimbursement; and
(c) properly interpret and manage accounting and subloan information (para.
3.14). In addition, the PU suffered from its poor relationships with MAG and
BNF.



-7-
5.02      In summary, the PU's management consisted mainly of livestock
technicians, whose knowledge of proper administrative and management
procedures were inadequate. In mid-January 1985 the Government terminated
the PU and transferred to BNF the responsibility to complete the project.
The PU actively opposed its own termination, and refused to cooperate in the
handing over of some project records and information causing a delay in the
final three months of disbursements.
National Center for the Promotion of Small and Artisan Industry (CENAPIA)
5.03      While CENAPIA insisted on and obtained agreo-ent for 't to be in
charge of managing the agroindustri-s component of the project, it performed
poorly. During the project period, there were several changes in management
and it suffered from budgetary restrictions. Its management of subloan
records was poor, and it was not able to promote many subprojects (the
majority of agroindustrial subprojects were promoted and managed by BNF).
National Development Bank (BNF)
5.04      BNF is the main source of agricultural credit in Ecuador and under
the project loaned 79% of the number of loans and 64% of the amount loaned.
At the beginning of the project period, BNF had a poor institutional
reputation, with poor account1ing practices and an inadequate system of
internal control. With the assistance of an FAO/UNDP team of consultants,
BNF underwent a substantial program of institutional development and is
currently considered a reasonably good financial institution. However, it
still suffers from some decapitalization, caused mainly by its lending in the
past at negative fixed rates of interest.
5.05      BNF's management of the final stages of the project was efficient.
The PCR prepared was of reasonably good quality, after taking into
consideration the lack of cooperation from the PU and the unavailability of
several documents (para. 5.02).
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      Bank supervision was adequate and timely.  Throughout the life of
the project, the Bank's attention to the lack of counterpart funds
overshadowed all other problems. This problem was compounded by the
inaccurate subloan records maintained by the PU, and its poor management of
the project. During appraisal, the Bank was aware of the PU's poor
management and provided for the recruitment for a financial adviser. Also,
it noted the PU's poor relationship with BNF.  It was unfortunate that the
Bank did not insist strongly enough on the r:cruitment of the financial
adviser during project implementation, and was unable to influence an
improvement in the relationship between the PU and BNF, the most important
participating institution in the project.
6.02      The Bank's initial concern on the effect of negative interest rates
on the participating institutions was satisfied through the increase in rates
at the beginning of the project. However, the Bank was unable to obtain a
commitment for subsequent automatic adjustments during implementation to
reflect the future significant increase in inflation.



-8-
6.03      BNF's responsiveness to the Bank's criticism of its internal
control, accounting and audit procedures helped to influence it to become a
much Improved credit institution. This improvement resulted in BNF's
efficient execution of the final stages of the project, and its acceptance as
the recipient of the second agricultural credit project to Ecuador, which is
about to become effective.
6.04      The Bank contributed to the termination of the PU after having made
many unsuccessful efforts to improve that institution's performance.
However, supervision in general tended to focus heavily on increasing
disbursements and ensuring the timely availability of counterpart fdnds.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      While there are some areas of uncertainty, the main project
objectives set at appraisal were met. The project mainly supported
livestock, and while productivity only increased marginally, the area under
production and the number of animals increased significantly. The thrust to
deliver an increased number of small subloans for crop production was not
achieved, mainly because of the failure to obtain a closer working
relationship with the Cooperative Bank. While the technical support program
deviated slightly from the original plan, the contributions to pastures
development through INIAP, the University of Loja and the Technical College
of Chimborazo were quite significant. The main constraints suffered by
the project were: (a) the failure of the PU and CENAPIA to develop as strong
institutions; and (b) the lack of a variable interest-rate system to reflect
the changing levels of inflation.
7.02      Lessons learned were:  (a) private financial institutions will lose
their interest in those projects that are unreliable in meeting financial
obligations (lack of counterpart funds for discounting); (b) adequate
financial management is a prime requirement for all credit-related projects;
and (c) institutions included for project participation should first have an
understanding of the project and be committed to it (e.g., Cooperative Bank).
