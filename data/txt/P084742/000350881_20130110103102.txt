F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective was to increase water and agricultural productivity in
low and medium yield farm land areas; raise farmers' income and strengthen their
competitive capacity under post-WTO conditions; and demonstrate and promote


                                            iii
sustainable participatory rural water resources management and agro-ecological
environmental management in the 3-H Basin.

Although its objectives are similar to those of IAIL2, IAIL3 would focus more on raising
productivity of land and water, rather than only production; and on enhancing the farmer
income and the farmers' share of higher market values, rather than raising income solely
through higher production. And IAIL3 would add important innovations to modernize
agriculture and enhance farmer competitive capacity. The competitive challenges
resulting from China's entry into the WTO are driving these changes.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to enhance adaptation to climate change in
agriculture and irrigation water management practices through awareness raising,
institutional and capacity strengthening and demonstration activities in the 3H Basin.
This would assist in mainstreaming climate change adaptation measures, techniques and
activities into the national Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) Program
which is China's largest national investment program in irrigated agriculture.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 (a) Context at Appraisal (IBRD Project)

During 1993-2003, China’s annual GDP growth averaged 8.6 percent. China’s accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 had strengthened China’s economic
position but also opened the country to foreign competition. Despite rapid growth and
significant achievements in poverty reduction, more than 200 million people still lived on
expenditures of less than US$1 per day and more than 30 million people were below the
government’s rural income poverty line of CNY625 (US$77 equivalent) per annum. At
the time of appraisal, food security was an important strategic issue. National grain
production had peaked at 512 million tons in 1998 but had dropped to an estimated 465
million tons in 2004.

The basin of the Huang, Huai, and Hai rivers (3-H Basin), also called the North China
Plain, is China’s most important agricultural region. It produced 50 percent of the
national grain output, accounted for about 35 percent of national industrial output, and
supported a population of 425 million. Severe water shortages in the 3-H Basin
threatened both rural income growth and food security and were exacerbated by high
levels of water pollution. Water demand in the region was high and growing while
available water resources were already allocated and overexploited. Groundwater levels
were dropping in many areas, sometimes by as much as one meter per year.

While WTO membership provided new opportunities for increasing farm incomes, the
agricultural sector needed to undergo substantial structural change and modernization to
take advantage of those opportunities. Agricultural practices needed to improve to
produce safe, high quality and high value products, which accounted for an increasingly
larger share of the market. Water resources had to be used more efficiently, and
agricultural pollution had to be curtailed. These issues were high on the Government’s
priority list, with raised productivity levels, domestic self-sufficiency, reform of food
safety control, and international competitiveness included as central themes in China’s
Five Year Plans for National Economic and Social Development for 2001-2005 and for
2006-2010.

Improving performance of the agricultural sector in the 3-H Basin was critical to achieve
these strategic objectives. Major challenges towards achieving these objectives included:
the low efficiency and quality of agricultural production; low market value of farmers’
production; low efficiency of irrigation facilities; and weak irrigation management. The
Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Project 3 was designed with components to address
these key constraints.

Bank involvement in the project was justified for the following reasons: First, within the
framework of the WTO, China needed to participate and perform in internationally
competitive agriculture. The Bank was in the unique position to bring lessons and
experiences from the European Union as well as other WTO accession countries to China
to guide the design and implementation of the proposed project. Specific experiences to
be transferred to China included: crop diversification, modern cropping methods and soil


                                            1
conservation, and market-orientation and strengthening of agricultural value chains.
Second, the new project would build on the successful implementation experience of the
preceding Irrigated Agriculture Intensification 2 Project, and would deepen the integrated
program approach to irrigation investment promoted under the previous project. It would
support improved Water User Associations (WUAs) which had been successfully piloted
in the earlier project and were needed to improve local water management and operation
and maintenance of irrigation facilities. The new project would integrate the Bank’s
experience and innovation relating to water saving and groundwater management,
production and marketing of non-polluting or green food, Farmer Associations (FAs) for
specialized crop production and marketing. It would also pilot farmer-owned Farmer
Cooperatives (FCs) to improve farmers’ incomes and competitive capacity. Extending
these initiatives to the 3-H Basin offered a tremendous opportunity to deepen the Bank-
Government cooperation towards the strategic need of more competitive and resource
efficient agriculture.

1.1 (b) Context at appraisal (GEF-SCCF Project)

During the first two years of implementation of the project, the possible impact of climate
variability on agricultural production in China was subject to much discussion. It was
widely believed that the projected climate change could decrease water stream flows and
groundwater recharge in the 3-H Basin, while concurrently increasing irrigation water
demand and withdrawals due to higher temperatures and higher evapo-transpiration (ET).
Also, the stagnation of grain production for a number of consecutive years in the 3-H
Basin was linked to climate change. China’s irrigated agriculture was expected to be
negatively affected by climate change and adaptation measures needed to be designed to
address possible impacts.

In 2008, around the MTR, both the Bank and the Government concluded that while the
objectives of IAIL3 continued to remain fully relevant, the project components on water-
saving irrigation, drainage, agro-ecological environmental protection and management
needed to be viewed much more in the context of a broader strategy of climate change
adaptation than originally envisaged during project design. Some of the project’s
interventions had an adaptation element embedded in them, but this was not the result of
a calculated and systematic adaptation approach.

Based on such considerations, a GEF grant under the Special Climate Change Fund
(SCCF) was sought to complement the project. Specifically, the GEF grant was to
support the development of a systematic adaptation-oriented approach building on
climate change impact assessments, identification of appropriate adaptation measures,
and the demonstration of adaption measure in selected sites for possible uptake by farmer
groups. GEF support would also be used to modify and adjust interventions for the
remaining two years of implementation of the lending project, where needed. Support
from the GEF was also sought to assist Government in incorporating climate adaptation
as a core theme in China’s National Comprehensive Agriculture Development Program
(CAD).




                                            2
To promote an integrated approach to adaption in irrigated agriculture, a total investment
need of US$55.5 million was identified. The GEF contribution would amount to US$5
million, while IBRD loan funds of US$20 million and counterpart funds of US$30.5
million would be reallocated to adaption investments under the IAIL3 project. The GEF-
financed activities and targeted outcomes were envisaged to be scaled-up under IAIL3,
first with a focus on the 3-H Basin but with the potential for further scale-up to other
agriculture regions.

With its global perspective, the GEF in partnership with the Bank was well positioned to
bring knowledge and institutional experience gained from its programs worldwide to
China. The IAIL3 project, which at that time had another 2.5 years for implementation,
provided an excellent platform for demonstrating climate change adaptation measures.
The project area covered the primary grain production region in China that was
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Water saving irrigation and water saving
agriculture measures proposed under the IAIL3 project were among the most likely to be
affected adversely by climate change and therefore it was imperative to retrofit the
program of interventions to render them more climate-smart. The project was also part of
the CAD program and offered the possibility for mainstreaming innovative adaptation
measures into a major national program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Project Development Objective was to increase water and agricultural productivity in
low and medium yield farm land areas; raise farmers’ income and strengthen their
competitive capacity under post-WTO conditions; and demonstrate and promote
sustainable participatory rural water resources management and agro-ecological
environmental management in the 3-H Basin.

The main project outcomes were: (a) increased water and agricultural productivity and
resource use efficiency; (b) increased per capita income for farm households; (c)
increased high quality/value and non-polluting/green crop production; (d) adoption of
techniques leading to ‘real’ water savings and mitigation of adverse environmental
impacts including ET-management and Laser Controlled Land Grading; and (e)
establishment of institutional mechanisms for enhanced farmer involvement and
participation.

The project focused on raising productivity of land and water rather than on simply
increasing production per se; and on enhancing market values and farmer incomes and
their share of higher market values, rather than raising income solely through higher
production. The project also added important innovations to modernize agriculture and
enhance farmers’ competitive capacity. The competitive challenges of China’s entry into
WTO and the world economy were driving these changes.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)



                                            3
The Global Environment Objective was to enhance adaptation to climate change in
agriculture and irrigation water management practices through awareness-raising,
institutional and capacity strengthening and demonstration activities in the 3H (Huang,
Huai, Hai rivers) Basin. This would help mainstreaming climate change adaptation
measures, techniques and activities into the Comprehensive Agricultural Development
(CAD) Program, which is China’s largest national investment program in irrigated
agriculture.

The main expected project outcomes were: (a) increased climate change adaptation
awareness of farmers, Water User Associations (WUA) and Farmer Professional
Associations (FA) members, technical staff and officials; (b) relevant climate change
adaptation measures implemented in selected demonstration areas and by participatory
stakeholders; and (c) documents issued by state, provincial and country CADs integrating
adaptation policies, measures and activities (through policy briefs, government reports,
implementation and/or replication plans).

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target group beneficiaries were the farmers in the 107 counties of the five
project provinces, including Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong and Henan, and project
WUA member farmers in 16 counties of the five provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities, including Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Ningxia.
Additional project beneficiaries were: (a) SOCAD, POCAD and COCAD PMO members
and staff; (b) Water Resource Bureau (WRB), Agricultural Bureau (AB), Forestry Bureau
(FRB) and other government staff associated with the project; (c) consumers demanding
high quality and green produce; and (d) private investors associated with FAs and FCs.
The project aimed to benefit 1.4 million households or a total of about 5.45 million rural
people (2.77 million men and 2.68 million women).

Under the GEF-SCCF project, about 400,000 households in 10 project counties and the
other extended areas under IAIL3 were to benefit either from participation in
demonstrations or from the adoption of the demonstrated adaptation measures.

1.7 (a) Original Components (as approved)

The IAIL3 Project included the following four components:



                                            4
Component 1: Water-saving Irrigation and Drainage (US$316.14 million, of which
US$142 million financed by IBRD). Main activities included: (a) improvement and
construction of local irrigation and drainage systems at the tertiary and on-farm level for
about 500,000 ha of low-and medium-yield land; (b) implementation of engineering
water-saving measures; (c) implementation of agronomic water-saving measures; (d)
implementation of water-saving management measures, including WUAs in the five
project provinces and in other selected provinces, and installation of water measuring
facilities and equipment at all sites; and (e) preparation and implementation of
groundwater management plans in water-short project counties in Hebei Province.

Component 2: Agricultural Modernization and Organization Development
(US$65.47 million, of which US$21 million financed by IBRD). The primary
activities: (a) strengthening and modernization of agricultural services and support
systems; (b) high quality and specialized crops demonstration, extension and production;
(c) development and support of farmers’ organizations; and (d) applied technology and
institutional training for farmers, agricultural technicians and farmers’ professional
organizations.

Component 3: Agro-ecological Environmental Protection and Management
(US$24.46 million, of which US$11 million financed by IBRD). Main activities
included: (a) establishment of shelterbelt forest networks around farmlands; (b)
Integrated Pest Management for forestry development; (c) environmental monitoring and
management; (d) training on environment and soil and water conservation; (e)
demonstration and extension services on environment and ecology; and (f) preparation
and execution of groundwater management plans in project water-short counties.

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management Support
(US$57.11 million, of which US$26 million financed by IBRD). This included
financing of institutional strengthening and support under the project and capacity
building in the state, provincial and county CAD offices, including: (a) domestic and
international training; (b) domestic and international study tours; (c) use of specialized
domestic and international technical assistance, including mobile expert teams; (d)
scientific research and demonstrations; (e) provision of office facilities; (f) development
of and maintenance support for an upgraded computerized project Management
Information System (MIS); (g) survey, design and supervision work for implementation,
including disbursement, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

Of the total project cost of US$463.7 million, US$50.5 million were set aside as
counterpart contribution to the GEF project (to be implemented during 2008-2010 of the
IAIL3 implementation period). These funds were used primarily for water-saving
initiatives under Component 1 (about 78% of the amount set aside). Component 2
(improved seeds, IPM technology demonstration, and establishment of WUAs and FCs)
was allocated about 5%, Component 3 (wind-breaking forest belts) about 6%, and
Component 4 (training) about 8% of the total. Bio-gas facilities and greenhouses were
new initiatives and received 3% of the total.




                                            5
1.7 (b) Original Components (as approved)

The GEF-SCCF Project included the following three components:

Component 1: Identification and Prioritization of Adaptation Options (US$0.50
million from GEF). Main activities included: (a) assessing the impact of climate change
in 3-H Basin and project area; (b) conducting a gap analysis and study on adaptation
measures to identify the needed adaptation measures and help integrate those measures
more broadly into IAIL3 and the CAD program; and (c) prioritizing and selecting
adaptation measures and demonstration areas, including consultations with farmers and
discussions with provincial and county experts to help incorporate empirical experiences
into the adaptation measures during project implementation.

Component 2: Demonstration and Implementation of Adaptation Measures
(US$48.43 million (US$2.25 million from GEF; US$46.18 million from IBRD). This
component aimed to: (a) introduce, demonstrate, and implement specific climate change
adaptation measures in selected demonstration areas under the GEF project; and (b)
integrate appropriate adaptation measures into the implementation of the IAIL3 project to
help reduce vulnerability to climate change in the 3-H Basin. The adaptation measures
would focus mainly on agricultural production and practices, and irrigation water
management and use, taking into account expected temperature increases resulting from
climate change. Adaptation measures would be carried out under the on-going
companion IAIL3 project, and would be expanded to cover as much of the project area as
possible.

Component 3: Mainstreaming Adaptation into National CAD Program and
Institutional Strengthening (US$2.25 million from GEF; US$4.32 million from
IBRD). The component aimed to integrate and mainstream climate change adaptation
into the ongoing national CAD program. Activities included a series of capacity building,
technical assistance, knowledge sharing, and public awareness activities, and preparation
of a National Climate Change Adaptation Plan for CAD.

1.8 Revised Components

The components were not modified in substance during implementation, either for the
IAIL3 project or for the GEF-SCCF project. At the Mid-term Review of the IAIL3
project, some components were slightly downsized to accommodate the impact of the
RMB appreciation against the US$. The components were also downsized somewhat
since the Government’s own programs had already provided funds for some activities,
such as provision of high quality seeds and agricultural mechanization. Following the
MTR, the GEF-supported adaptation approach was incorporated into irrigation
investments under the IAIL3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 (a) Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry – IAIL3 Project

The Bank included the agenda for the preparation of IAIL3 in the last several supervision
missions of IAIL2, with SOCAD and the POCADs undertaking high quality preparation
work and providing their contributions based in part on the advice and guidance of the
Bank missions. Due to the advanced state and high quality of preparation, the pre-
appraisal mission was converted to appraisal. A challenge for the Bank was the
formulation of the project legal documents, approval process, and disbursement
procedures to enable the incorporation of the five additional participating provinces that
had not been identified originally.

Although the project was large in terms of the projected cost, the project design was
straight-forward. The three key components (water-saving measures, agriculture
modernization, and agro-ecological environmental management) clearly addressed the
main constraints to the realization of the new opportunities brought about by China’s
entry into the WTO, namely the need to become more competitive, to more effectively
utilize water resources, and to move towards vertical integration in the agriculture sector.

Lessons learned from IAIL2 and other water resources projects, including the local level
operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes, the “user pays? principle, participatory
WUA management, institutional capacity building, and others, were adequately reflected
in the design. Risks related to the functioning of the WUAs were well identified,
including appropriate mitigating measures. Strong government commitment and
intensive participation by the SOCAD, POCADs and COCADs during preparation
improved considerably the quality and relevance of project content.

2.1(b) Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry – GEF-SCCF project

The Bank and SOCAD were proactive in identifying the need for a strategic approach to
adaption in irrigated agriculture. The Bank and SOCAD were highly effective in the
design of an innovative approach to climate change adaptation. SOCAD had commenced
preparatory work with strong technical support on the climate change impact analysis
provided by the Bank’s expert team in late 2006. The Bank’s international expert team
also supported capacity building and TA to all experts and officials involved (including
national scientists, local line agency experts and SOCAD/POCAD officials) at the early
project preparation stage, especially on topics such as climate impact analysis/modeling
studies for typical selected areas to identify and prioritize adaptation options and specific
measures for each demonstration area, to improve project preparation. SOCAD had a
solid proposal for review and appraisal by the Bank in late 2007. The lower level CAD
Project Management Offices (PMOs) contributed significantly to the preparatory work
and this ensured their buy-in at an early stage. Since the GEF grant was relatively small
(US$5 million), the preparation team rightly focused on identifying climate change-
related issues in irrigated agriculture, gaps in adaptation measures, limited
demonstrations in selected activities and geographical areas, capacity building, and
working towards mainstreaming the adaptation concept into the overall CAD program.

2.2 Implementation

The SOCAD Central Project Management Office (CPMO) and PMOs and units
implemented the project efficiently, and completed or exceeded all output targets as
planned. Project investments were completed ahead of time and within the project
budget (other than exchange rate changes), with strong, effective and innovative
leadership from the project management team. The Bank provided quality supervision and
specialized technical implementation assistance, especially on innovative topics like
design of comprehensive water saving measures, sustainable WUAs, gender-based
training, FAs/FCs and green and organic crop production and modernizing agriculture.
Specialized technical support was also provided through the Pro-poor Rural Water
Reform Project (PPRWRP), particularly on the innovative M&E components to monitor
the impacts of on the improved WUAs.

The Bank and SOCAD effectively and successfully seized the opportunity to integrate the
climate adaptation into the project interventions by blending it with a parallel GEF
project and with counterpart funds sourced from IAIL3. This provided a new direction to
the improvement in irrigated agriculture initiatives and eventually embedded this
approach into the overall CAD program. The project team made full use of the
restructuring options available to reallocate funds across components and address
exchange rate changes under IAIL3 (2008) and GEF-SCCF (2011).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Project M&E consisted of three parts: (a) the project MIS; (b) the project M&E system;
and (c) the specialized WUA M&E system. All parts were multilevel, computerized and
internet-based, and integrated with each other. These systems together enabled the
CPMO and lower PMOs to monitor and evaluate activities closely.

The MIS and WUA-M&E were based on systems developed and implemented under
IAIL2 and PPRWRP. Before project start-up, they were adapted to meet IAIL3
requirements. The MIS enabled management to track procurement, physical progress,
financial progress, and disbursements/reimbursements in near real-time and to closely
monitor and control financial accountability. The project M&E was developed during
start-up, and consisted of a very wide range of indicators on which information was to be
collected at the county/farmer level.

These systems were operational early during implementation and were integrated into
project implementation from the beginning, starting with the baseline surveys. The M&E
and WUA-M&E enabled project management to monitor and evaluate implementation
status and quality of progress almost in real time and thus take any corrective measures
needed rapidly. The specialized WUA-M&E monitored many aspects of the improved
WUAs under the project, ranging from economic benefits (calculated by comparison to
control groups), to quality (such as availability of operational water measurement
facilities, election of WUA chairmen) to their financial operation (e.g., whether water
charges covered their costs of O&M). The WUA-M&E was also linked to the
reimbursement section of the MIS to help ensure that improved WUA quality


                                           8
requirements specified in the project legal documents were met before disbursements
were made.

Overall, the M&E system was well designed and implemented. The M&E
implementation units were established at SOCAD and every POCAD and COCAD PMO
level with adequate staffing, training and supervision. The periodic M&E reports were
produced and consolidated at provincial and state level, and the reliable information was
generated and analyzed, and put to use to monitor the progress towards the achievement
of PDO.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The safeguard policies triggered under the IAIL3 project included: Involuntary
Resettlement (OP4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OP4.10), Safety of Dams (OP4.37) , and
Pest Management (OP4.09). Activities under the GEF-SCCF project were intended to
protect vulnerable eco-systems from climate change impacts. Since the scope of
activities and the physical areas of their implementation were identical with those of
IAIL3, any issues relating to safeguards compliance were to be handled under the IAIL3
Resettlement Policy Framework and Ethnic Minority Development Plans.

Environmental Safeguards The project was correctly assessed as a Category “B?
project. A comprehensive environmental assessment was carried out in accordance with
the policies and procedures of the Government of China and the Bank. The
implementing agencies established independent environmental management teams that
were responsible for implementation, supervision and monitoring of the Environmental
Management Plans (EMP). These were adequately funded. The EMP was implemented
satisfactorily. Environmental monitoring was carried out by certified institutions and
included: monitoring of groundwater level and quality; soil fertility monitoring; and
water quality monitoring in the project areas. The monitoring data indicated that the
groundwater extraction in most province counties was reduced, and both soil and water
quality in the project areas improved compared to the baseline. The environmental
impacts resulting from the project construction were also mitigated and controlled to
acceptable levels.

Based on a post-evaluation of the environmental assessment and management of the
project, compliance with environmental requires was satisfactory. In addition, the
following measures and arrangements ensured that the project objectives was achieved in
an environmental friendly and sustainable manner: (a) considering water resources
conservation and management as key aspect for environmental management in project
areas; (b) defining clear responsibility for environmental management in the project
areas; (c) enhancing analysis, evaluation and utilization of environmental monitoring
data; (d) ensuring budget allocation for environmental management and monitoring; and
(e) including the key mitigation measures into the contract and enhancement of project
on-site environmental supervision.

Social Safeguards The project implemented a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
which had been developed to guide any potential involuntary acquisition of land. The


                                           9
project added 5,747 mu of cultivated land to the existing irrigated areas (instead of
occupying land) through supporting measures, including the construction of culverts to
replace the open canals, completion of auxiliary canal structures, and land leveling, the
project. Some activities included in the component for development of agro-service
system, such as construction of buildings for good quality seed production, and agro-
technical service centers at township level, were all rehabilitation or expansion within the
existing land and buildings. So was construction of nurseries for forestry activities.
Because of the adjustment and re-distribution in the canal-farmland-tree-road systems,
land adjustment occurred and involved some individual farmer households. The
consultation mechanism established under the project for such land adjustment in the
CAD process was satisfactorily employed. Not a single dispute occurred due to land
adjustment, and the very high recognition by the farmers of the need for land adjustment
facilitated project implementation. In order to avoid losses of green crops, construction
of on-farm works were all scheduled for time periods after autumn harvest, before the
winter sowing season, or during the winter fallow season, with full farmer consultation,
mitigating the need for compensation.

Yunnan Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region included some ethnic minority groups in the project areas, including Mongol,
Miao, Yao, Hui. Ethnic Minorities Development Plans (EMDP) were prepared to direct
project activities in these areas.

At project completion, a total of 293 WUAs had been established in these three provinces.
These WUAs functioned well in irrigation management, water saving practice, and
farmer participatory capacity building. More than 700,000 farmers participated in the
WUA development process, of which 67,705 (of 10%) were from ethnic minorities.
Ethnic women participation was a specific focus of the WUA formation as was ensuring
that ethnic minorities and women were adequately represented on the WUA executive
committees. The covenants of the WUA charter ensured equal rights for the ethnic
minority groups. Of the 293 WUAs established, 67 had ethnic minorities acting as
chairpersons, including five female ethnic minority chairpersons, and totally 141 ethnic
minority women were members of the executive committee

Safety of Dams. Under the project, 36 dams serving the project area required inspection.
These were inspected regularly and a Dam Safety Report was submitted to the Bank
annually in compliance with Bank policy and the provisions of the legal agreements. All
of the 36 dams were all in normal operation, safe and in reliable condition.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM activities were organized and carried out by
county PMOs in cooperation with plant protection stations and agro-technique extension
stations of the local agricultural departments. Mobile expert panels at the province and
city levels provided comprehensive guidance and technical assistance to all project areas
and monitored performance. Investment was made in pest observation and forecast sites,
equipment, and about 26,000 person-months of IPM training were provided. The project
focused on establishing demonstration areas for integrated pest and disease control and
prevention for various crops. IPM activities covered 534,961 ha or 96.5% of project area.



                                            10
Fiduciary Requirements. Compliance was ensured through regular supervision by the
CPMO and PMOs and through the MIS. Regular Bank supervision missions reviewed
project financial management and fiduciary compliance at all levels.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The project was designed in part to introduce innovations into SOCAD management and
the CAD program. In the course of the project, SOCAD replaced the traditional
government budget allocation system and introduced the reimbursement system method
followed under the project into the CAD program. This helped SOCAD to ensure that
CAD construction and other field activities are carried out according to specified
standards. SOCAD also issued a requirement that a portion of the investment budget for
CAD land improvements program should be used to train WUA member farmers for
improved agriculture and to support WUA establishment. O&M of irrigation facilities
constructed under the project are being managed by WUAs. In non-WUA areas, O&M
plans were prepared early in the project and implemented locally to mainstream the
process. Many activities, such as strengthening of the agro-technical service centers
under the ABs, are being operated through existing government programs. Windbreak
and forestry plantations under the project are being maintained by local villages and
farmers. The institutional arrangements for post-project operation of the facilities and
organizations established under the project are adequate and functional.

The project achievements have successfully offered a clear demonstration and path to
mainstream adaptation measures into the both irrigation and agriculture sectors The
SOCAD/POCADs are committed to scale up project success in their major ongoing
national comprehensive agriculture development program, particularly: (a) the
development of available water resources and comprehensive water-saving
technologies/approach integrating the engineering, agronomic and institutional water
saving management; (b) adopting application of adaptive cultivation and new anti-
adversity varieties for drought-resistant, water-logging-resistant, high (or low)-
temperature of-resistant and disease resistance, e.g., in response to higher frequency
warm winters and increased extreme events; and (c) institutional development of WUAs,
FAs and FCs, and continuous participation throughout the investment program
empowered farmers, scientists and government officials. The good practices and lessons
are also being scaled-up through the provincial CAD program and a Bank-financed
follow-on project, notably the China-Integrated Modern Agriculture Development Project
(IAIL4), which is under preparation and will be implemented by SOCAD and six
provinces in the China’s other grain production regions. In addition, some of the
technical and institutional innovations introduced under project are being adopted in
policy, planning and investment for climate change adaptation into the SOCAD’s
national CAD investment program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives and design of the project continue to remain highly relevant. The need to


                                          11
improve farm incomes and the environment, and enhance adaptation to climate change in
agriculture and irrigation water management practices which were the primary focus of
project, are both recognized as key strategic objectives for China. The PDO and project
design remained highly relevant and consistent with national policy priorities and the
World Bank-China Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006-2011 that succeeded the
Country Assistance Strategy of the preparation and design period. The Government’s
11th and 12th Five Year Plans (2006-10 and 2011-15) placed high priority on a
‘harmonious society’ that balances economic growth with income distributional and
ecological concerns. The project directly contributed to two outcomes of the CPS’s
“Supporting Greener Growth? strategic theme: promoting sustainable agricultural
practices and demonstrating sustainable natural resources management approaches.

The project’s innovations range from improved WUAs, to water savings techniques to
climate change adaptation, all of which are critical for agricultural sustainability and for
increasing production, saving water, ensuring food security, raising rural incomes, and
reducing the long-term environmental and ecological impacts of agriculture.
Consequently, design continues to remain satisfactory. Regarding implementation, all
project activities were executed as designed, and implementation of IAIL3 was further
bolstered by the addition of the GEF funded activities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives

The project fully achieved its three development objectives. Given the attainment or
surpassing of virtually all of the PDO indicators and Intermediate indicators as discussed
below in detail (and presented in the Results Framework analysis in the Datasheet), the
achievement of PDO and GEO is rated Highly Satisfactory.

IAIL3 PDO Indicators

Indicator 1: Increased per capita farm household incomes. The average per capita net
income (including non-agricultural income) of farmers in the project area increased
higher than estimated target (about 151% of the appraisal estimate) through increased
high quality/value crop productions. Since the extent of increase varied across the
economic status of the farmer group, an assessment was made of income increase for
three distinct income groups: (a) per capita income of households with high incomes
increased to 3,742 yuan 1 from 2,464 yuan at appraisal (151.9% of appraisal estimate); (b)
per capita income of households with medium incomes increased to 3,067 yuan from
1,423 yuan at appraisal (155.3% of appraisal estimate); and (c) per capita income of
households with low incomes increased to 2,541 yuan from 1,135 yuan at appraisal
(156.5% of appraisal estimate). The increase in incomes could be broadly attributed to
increased production and water productivity (Indicators 2, and 3 and 4 respectively,



1
    Yuan is the unit measure on the Chinese currency of Renminbi.



                                            12
discussed below), and higher per unit sale realization. The per capita income of
households involved in farmers specialized production associations increased to 4,031
yuan from 2,231 yuan (181% of appraisal estimate).

The shift from traditional low value grain production to high value cash crops, non-
polluting, green and organic products contributed to dramatic increase in household
incomes. For example, monitoring results indicate that per capita income of households
producing green agro-products increased to 4,639 yuan by project completion. Annual
area devoted to production of crops in this new group increased from virtually zero to
about 100,000 hectares.

The project, through its mechanization initiatives, created an unexpected third source of
income – resulting from saving of time from agricultural operations which helped
generate off-farm income for the farm families. Likewise, effective irrigation
management by project-established WUAs helped to reduce time and labor the
households spent on irrigation. As a result, some members of the households could work
as migrant workers supplementing their family income. According to results of WUA
monitoring, the ratio of perennial migrant workers to the local population in the 5
provinces increased to 7% in 2010, up from 3% in the previous year. This was
significantly higher than in the non-project areas control group. Increasingly, farmers in
the project area are now working in businesses such as animal husbandry, fishery, fruit
forestry, agro-product processing and transportation, enjoying broadened employment
opportunities. The amount of additional income from these sources is not quantified but
is estimated to be substantial.

Indicator 2: Increased high quality crop production, including high value, green, non-
polluting and organic crops production to strengthen farmer’s competitive capacity
under post-WTO entry conditions. The crop production in the project areas increased as
follows: (a) grain production – from 3.2 million tons to 4.2 million tons; (b) cash crops –
from 4.4 million tons to 4.6 million tons; and (c) non-polluting green and organic crops –
from zero to about 100,000 hectares being allocated to these crops.

This increase could be attributed to two specific groups of activities: (a) increased water
availability and improved water productivity (Indicator 3 and 4, discussed below); and
(b) modernization of agriculture.

Before the project implementation, most of the farmland in the project area was in poor
irrigation condition and some farmland was not leveled, with undulating surface and poor
water and nutrient retaining capacity, which, coupled with extensive farming and
irrigation practice, resulted in poor irrigation efficiency and soil erosion. Through project
implementation, on-farm water conservation initiatives were introduced and matched
with auxiliary structures which enhanced the anti-disaster (drought/flood) capability of
the farmland. This created a solid foundation for increased production of grain and cash
crops, with the multiple planting index in the project area increasing by 4%, from 183%
at appraisal to 187% at project closing.




                                             13
Agricultural modernization contributed significantly to increased production too.
Compared to baseline, coverage of project area for high quality seeds rose from 88% to
100%, IPM from 67% to 97%, and for mechanization 66% to 81%. Additionally, the
quality of extension advice also improved, becoming more personal, with a single worker
supporting 25 farmers compared to 65 at appraisal.

Along with improvement of basic agro-production conditions, the project encouraged
adjustment of cropping mix by farmers, and relied on extensive demonstrations and
training to promote development of modern, highly efficient agriculture. In the project
areas, planting of good quality seeds and high value cash crops increased, indicating a
shift from traditional low value agriculture to high yield, improved quality, high value,
and high efficiency agriculture. Monitoring results in the project provinces indicate that
the planting area ratio of grains to cash crops changed in favor of cash crops, increasing
between 2% to 4% in the project areas (Heibei: cash crops planting area up from 36% to
38% of total production; Jiangsu: 20% to 24%; Anhui: 29% to 31%; Shandong: 25%-
29%; and Henan: 26% to 29%). This compares with a maximum incremental 1% planting
area being devoted to cash crops.

The environmental and price advantage of non-polluting, green and organic agro-
products has spurred the farmers in the project areas to venture into this area aggressively.
Monitoring indicators show that during the project period 250 agro-products produced in
the project areas were certified as non-polluting agro-products, 117 agro-products were
certified as green food, and 18 agro-products were in the conversion period for organic
food certification. The total area covered was about 100,000 hectares (59,000 hectares
for non-polluting products, 35,000 hectares for green products, and 3,000 hectares for
organic products). This has not only strengthened farmer incomes but also improved food
safety and agro-ecological environmental management in the project areas.

Indicator 3: Improved water productivity: Water usage at project completion dropped to
3,809 m3/ha or 60% of the appraisal target of 6,306 m3/ha, compared to baseline usage
of 6,892 m3/ha. With increased production, water productivity rose from the baseline of
1.06 kg/m3 to 1.55 kg/m3 at completion, exceeding the appraisal target of 1.45kg/m3.

Most of the improvement could be attributed to comprehensive water saving measures
taken to reduce the on-farm water consumption and irrigation quota, increase overall
water availability, improve irrigation efficiency,, and improve overall participatory
management of the resource through WUAs. Under the project, three specific groups of
real water saving measures to reduce the real water consumption (ET) and increase water
availability and upgrade water use efficiency were adopted: (a) engineering water saving
measures such as canal lining, construction of low pressure pipelines, use of sprinkler
irrigation and micro-irrigation, completion of canal system, combined use of canals and
wells, and surface and groundwater to increase the irrigation efficiency and reduce the
water application; (b) agronomic water saving measures such as land leveling, deep
plowing, adjustment of agro-production structure based on local natural resources and
economic conditions, use of crop residues to conserve moisture, and water-saving
irrigation scheduling and water-saving planting methods to reduce evapo-transpiration of



                                            14
crops and increase yield; and (c) managerial water saving measures such as river basin-
based unified surface and underground water management, reform of water management
system and maintenance, promotion of self-managed irrigation areas, and cost
recovery/levying adequate water charges through WUA development and effective
operations. Implementation of a combination of these measures produced water-saving
benefits, resulting in increase of canal water use efficiency from 58% (pre-project) to
79% (post-project).

Indicator 4: Establishment of institutions for enhanced farmer participation and
involvement: To enable, promote sustainable participatory water resources management,
and support increased farmer participation, 1,022 WUAs with a membership of 490,000,
and covering about 225,000 hectares for participatory irrigation management, 207
Farmers’ Associations (FAs), and 20 pilot Farmers’ Cooperatives (FCs) were established
and operated.

As an important managerial water-saving measure, establishment of WUAs was a key
initiative under the project. Results from monitoring WUAs over the project period show
that yield of crops and farmers’ income in the areas with WUAs tended to increase each
successive year. At project completion, incremental yield of crops from the WUA-linked
farmers ranged from 5 to 32 kg per mu on average, and the annual unit yields were 9 to
177 kg higher than farmers from the non-WUA control group. Per capita annual income
of the households involved in the WUAs ranged from 5,318 yuan to 12,131 yuan,
including 2,773 yuan to 5,366 yuan of farm income. Incremental per capita annual
incomes of households in the WUA geographical areas and those in non-WUA areas
ranged from 130 yuan to 1,437 yuan and from 58 to 766 yuan, respectively.

The 207 Farmers’ Associations have a membership of about 153,941 household members
and 331,705 households of radiation led farmers. The 20 Farmers’ Cooperatives have a
membership of 5,783 households and 45,077 households of radiation led farmers. These
specialized farmer organizations provide information, techniques and marketing services
to their members, and have become the “bridge? linking up farmers with markets. They
are playing an important role in agro-production process, and are functioning in
facilitating agro-production restructuring, upgrading farmers’ scientific knowledge and
educational quality, and assisting farmers to increase their incomes. Per capita income of
households involved in specialized farmer associations increased to 4,031 yuan at project
completion from 2,321 yuan at appraisal. Per capita income of households involved in
pilot FCs increased to 4,160 yuan at project completion from 2,637 yuan at appraisal.

GEF-SCCF GEO Indicators

GEO Indicator 1: Increased climate change adaptation awareness of farmers, Water
User Associations (WUA) and Farmer Professional Associations (FA) members,
technical staff and officials: About 56% of the stakeholders appear to have become
aware of the potential impacts of climate change and the adaptation measures.

Awareness among Staff of SOCAD, POCADs, COCADs and Research Groups. Special
subject studies on adaptation to climate change organized by SOCAD and POCADs and


                                           15
carried out by national scientists and local experts were treated as an important element
for awareness raising among the project implementation and management officials and
staff at all levels. Twenty-seven climate change adaptation related studies were completed
with 215 scientists and experts involved from national Academy of Science and
Agriculture Science, Ministry of Water resources, and provincial technical research
institutes and universities, with substantial technical assistance supported by the Bank’s
international expert team on climate change impacts, specific adaptation options,
implications for farming and water management technologies, and inputs for policy
relating to CAD program. There was tremendous learning and awareness resulting from
such extensive studies and participation.

Awareness among Farmers, WUA/FA members, technicians and officials. Training
materials about global climate change and China’s policies for coping with it were
distributed to farmers in both the ten demonstration areas and the IAIL3 project areas, in
order to increase awareness about adaptation. These stakeholders, in both the ten
demonstration areas and the IAIL3 project areas, through their direct participation and
involvement in implementation, learned about climate change adaptation. Under the GEF-SCCF
project, a total of 210,659 ha of selected demonstrated areas by 298,732 participatory
stakeholders were covered, and under the IAIL3 project, 172,868 ha of farmland were covered,
including working through WUAs/FAs, and also establishing greenhouses and biogas tanks.

Awareness among the Broader Civil Society Members. SOCAD, POCADs and COCADs
proactively disseminated climate change adaptation knowledge (331 publications, about
102% of PAD target) and measures through website, booklets, newspapers, technical
magazine, TV, presentations on conferences and radio coverage at provincial, national
and international level (the project was selected by WRI and GEF as the good practice
dissemination project at Durban and Doha international climate change conferences).
This has resulted in deepening the understanding and appreciation of climate change
adaptation activities among civil society members.

Thematic Training and technical assistance. Cutting across various stakeholder groups,
extensive training on CC adaptation were carried out through workshops, seminars, study
tours and publications of training materials, including scientific understanding of climate
change to enhance awareness of farmers, technical staff, and officials on climate change
adaptation in agriculture and water sectors, and improve the institutional capacity for
project implementation and management. The training program covered 37,659 persons.
Reports and associated training materials (58,052 documents) were distributed to various
levels of government offices, technical implementation agencies, and farm villages.
Thirty four consultation and coordination meetings were held with the government
leaders and officials of related agencies to strengthen their capacity and awareness of
climate change adaptation and to promote the climate adaptation concepts and related
technical measures and options for the field implementation in specific demonstration
pilots. Climate change adaptation concepts have been widely accepted by the
government officials and farmers, and are reflected in the support offered to, and in the
implementation of, these initiatives in the project areas.




                                            16
GEO Indicator 2: Relevant climate change adaptation measures implemented in
selected demonstration areas and by participatory stakeholders: Climate change
adaptation measures were implemented in a total of 208,152 ha of selected demonstrated
areas (112% of PAD target) and IAIL3 project areas by 298,732 participatory
stakeholders (113% of PAD target). The adaptation measures were implemented by
farmers in the ten selected counties as demonstrations of integration of adaptation
measures under GEF-SCCF project, and scaled-up as adapted water-saving initiatives in
the IAIL3 project areas.

Adaptation in GEF-SCCF Demonstration Areas. Since implementation in 2008 in the
ten pilot counties, eight types of water and agriculture adaptation measures have been
demonstrated, including 314 sets of storm collection and storage facilities built, 33
adaptation agricultural technologies demonstrated, 450,000 kg of adaptive crop varieties
promoted, 3,880 sets of biogas tanks and 1,237,225m2 of greenhouses built, 710 ha of
forestation carried out, 183 WUAs/FAs developed, and groundwater monitoring (in
Hebei) enhancing water resources management and adaptation capacity carried out. In
terms of actual adaptation of adaptation measures, a total of 35,284 ha of farmland and
145,005 households of participatory stakeholders in GEF-SCCF demonstration areas
have accepted the climate change concepts and introduced adaptation measures in their
operation.

Adaptation of IAIL3 Project Interventions. A total of 172,868 ha under IAIL3 project
were supported with adaptation measures covering 13 million m3 of channel excavation
and dredging, 691 sets of small water storage facilities, 1.8 million m2 of anti-seepage
channels, 4.5 million m2 of buried low-pressure pipelines, 39,000 hectares of land
leveling, 19,000 ha of mulching, introduction of 1.55 million kg of pest tolerant variety of
seeds, replication of pest control and prevention in 1,825 ha, greenhouse facilities of 1.2
million m2, and 1,230 sets of biogas tanks. As a result, the water and agriculture
productivity had been increased from 1.1 kg/cum to 1.39 kg/cum in project areas, and the
production per unit of ET had been improved from 55,000 kg to 114,000 kg.

A key indicator of the level and depth of climate change adaptation awareness is the
extent to which the four groups of interventions under IAIL3 during 2008-2010 were
modified to reflect the adaptation approach: (a) in terms of water resources, it was to
reinforce and optimize currently used measures and realize optimal water resources
utilization - upgrade the utilization efficiency of precipitation; implement combined
allocation, regulation and management of multiple water sources to upgrade overall water
use efficiency; develop alternative water sources; reduce non-productive or other
improper agricultural water consumption through            comprehensive water-saving
technologies to integrate engineering water-saving, agronomic water-saving and
regulation water-saving; (b) in terms of agricultural aspects, farming pattern and
production systems were aligned with farmland development to expand cultivation of
cash and feed crops and facilitate a transformation to a three-element structure of food,
feed and cash crops. The farming pattern was adjusted to develop multi-seasonal maturity
and higher re-vegetation frequency. Efforts were made to cultivate adversity resistant
varieties, improve layout of crops and varieties and programmatically develop and select



                                            17
drought, flood, high-temperature and pest resistant varieties, and develop greenhouses
and bio-gas tanks; (c) in terms of ecological aspects, selection and cultivation of cold,
drought, pest tolerant trees was strengthened to improve the adaptation capacity of forest
during the course of climate change and migration periods; and (d) in terms of public
awareness, the project strengthened awareness campaigns, education, study tours and
training in the IAIL3 project areas on climate change adaptation and responsive measures,
all of which greatly improved the public awareness about the importance and urgency of
climate change adaptation.

GEO Indicator 3: Documents issued by state, provincial and country CADs integrating
adaptation policies, measures and activities (through policy briefs, government reports,
implementation and/or replication plans): 173 governmental official documents on
climate change impacts and adaptation policies and implementation plans and technical
standards were issued and published (102% of PAD target). POCADs, based on the
review of the impacts of climate change, local provincial conditions, and the range of
adaptation options available, proactively introduced a number of policies, which has
provided policy support to the implementation of climate change concepts and greater
climate change adaptation capacity in the provinces and the sector. SOCAD and all
POCADs have issued “Circulations to Strengthen Climate Change Adaptation in CAD?
to all CAD counties to guide their national and provincial CAD investment program.
Overall, the policy recommendations to integrate CC adaptation into CAD program have
been formulated to mainstream climate change adaptation activities into the national and
provincial CAD program in the Twelfth Five-year plan.

3.3 Efficiency

The IAIL3 project outcomes included substantially improved agro-production conditions
in the project areas, upgraded agro-productivity and marketing conditions, higher crop
and water productivity, greatly strengthened competitiveness of agro-products produced
in the project areas, markedly increased farmer incomes, and a clearly improved agro-
ecological environment, all of which promote sustainable development of the 3-H Basin.
The estimated economic rates of return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) for IAIL3 at
completion (see Annex 3 for the detailed economic analysis) as compared to appraisal
estimates for the total project as a whole, and for each project province are provided
below:




                                           18
With respect to the GEF-SCCF project, scaling up the adaptation component under
IAIL3 accounted for 90% of the GEF project cost. This investment is included in the
IAIL3 project cost to calculate the revised ERRs. Other outcomes of the GEF-SCCF
project were more qualitative in nature, namely, studies, awareness building, informing
policy, and training and accounted for US$2.9 million of the grant amount.
Demonstration pilots were carried over 35,000 ha with a total cost of about US$2.1
million. No separate ERR was calculated for the GEF project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The objectives of the project continue to be relevant to the current need for modernizing
Chinese agriculture. At completion, the project had fully achieved or exceeded almost all
PDO indicators, and the estimated ERR also exceeded the appraisal estimate. As a result,
the overall outcome is rated Highly Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. Of the total of 1.4 million project beneficiary households, the lowest
income groups showed a slightly higher percent gain in income as compared to medium
and high income groups.

Eleven key national level poverty counties and 27 provincial level poverty counties or
economically less developed counties were among the 123 project counties. The project
focused on the poor and disadvantaged groups by exempting the 38 designated poverty
counties from their counterpart funding responsibilities and by making arrangements for
the respective provincial finance bureaus to assume counterpart funding responsibilities.
Arrangements were made to convert cash contributions into labor contributions for poor
farmers.

Poor households that could not afford water charges were fully or partially exempted
from the payment or allowed to defer the payment to the WUAs. In the regulations of
FAs or FCs, support policies were included to stimulate participation of poor households.
Special attention was given to ensure equal participation, status and rights of poor
households in the project. During the implementation period, the number of poor
households in the project area declined from 67,692 (base year) to 39,357 (completion).
The number of poor decreased from 254,718 (base year) to 143,317. Net income from
farming activities of the poor households increased from 1,011 yuan (base year) to 1,987
yuan at completion.

Gender Aspects. In terms of gender, participation by women was emphasized and
substantially increased in WUA development, with specialized training provided to
women both in WUAs and to project staff in the provinces as well integrating this into
SOCAD policies to promote participation by women in WUAs. In the process of


                                           19
establishing FAs and WUAs, women were to be included as candidates for election of
members to the executive committee or board of directors. This upgraded women’s
awareness of democracy and participation. Monitoring indicators show that in the 741
WUAs evaluated: (a) there were 87,245 female members, accounting for 25.6% of the
total; (b) 837 women functioned as water user group leaders, accounting for 14.6% of the
total; and (c) 805 women were members in executive committees, accounting for 17.9%
of the total. This has led to upgrading women’s status and role in the rural communities.

Social Development. In the process of establishing WUAs, FAs and FCs, PMOs in all
project areas adopted participatory approach and carried out training and publicity
activities. This enabled the farmers to understand the nature of “self-decision making,
self-management, and self-service? which underpin the successful operation of these
farmer organizations, and to appreciate their rights to know, to participate, to manage,
and to supervise in the process of organizational operation and management. Increased
farmer awareness and the level of their organization supported rural development
activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Farmer organizations such as WUAs, FAs and FCs were established or strengthened
under the project, and intensive training to farmers was provided. In addition, PMOs and
CAD offices at various levels were strengthened, as well other government agency
offices such as WRBs, ABs and FRBs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Ancillary Industry Development. In addition to enhancing directly the development of
local farming, building and improvement of rural roads, the project has also furthered the
development of the related service and ancillary industries, such as supply of agricultural
materials, logistics, trade, financing, agro-processing and similar activities, not to
mention increased consumer spending resulting from higher farm incomes. Most of such
industries were tertiary (logistics, trade, financing, catering), which mushroomed in the
private sector to support the project needs.

Private Sector Agriculture-related Investment. Completed infrastructure in the project
area provided a platform for private sector agriculture-related investment. The project
areas attracted funds for soil testing and formula-based fertilizer application project,
problem-tackling project for high-yield wheat production, paddy quality upgrading
project (Anhui province). Another example is private sector investment of 10 million
yuan to contract land for modernized agro-production, which further increased
agricultural benefits.

Demonstration Effects. In the project areas, the standardized and tidy farmland parcels,
smooth roads, well-completed system of canals and ditches, beautiful tree-belts formed a
picturesque countryside. Counties adjoining the project areas requested the CAD land
improvement program to be implemented in their areas too. For instance, after project
implementation in Zhuxiao Township of Changfeng County, Anhui Province, people


                                            20
from the surrounding non-project townships including Taohu and Xiatang township
requested the township government to extend the program to their areas.

Improved Groundwater Quality. Indiscriminate exploitation of water in the project
areas was effectively controlled and the tendency of groundwater table declines was
slowed so that a balance between extraction and replenishment could be realized. The
introduction of science-based fertilizer application and IPM techniques reduced the
amounts of fertilizer and pesticides entering into water bodies, reduced water pollution,
and helped to improve water quality in lakes, reservoirs and rivers in the project area.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

Rating: Negligible

The IBRD loan closed in December 2010. None of the risks identified at appraisal have
materialized and no risks that could threaten the project’s development outcome are
anticipated for the foreseeable future. The project does not face any significant technical,
financial, economic, social, political or environmental uncertainties. It enjoys strong
governmental ownership as well as financial and technical support at all levels.
Ownership of the project among farmers, WUAs, FAs and FCs is strong.

Most project activities were designed to be integrated and mainstreamed into the ongoing
CAD programs. This has been done successfully and project activities have continued to
receive support as needed under CAD programs. Several important innovations, such as
WUAs and FAs, are now self-managed and self-financing farmer organizations. Farmer
support to WUA is also strong and this is expected to remain so. The institutional
innovations have helped to support many of the technical outcomes under the project and
to reduce the sustainability risks to project outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

IBRD Project. The Bank facilitated the identification, preparation and appraisal of the
project, and this was critical to ensuring high quality at entry, given the wide scope of the
project, especially the number of innovations introduced. The Bank team realigned the
IAIL2 focus from mere production increase to a shift to high value, high quality crops,
improved competitiveness, and enhanced water productivity. Good practice examples of
participatory management and implementation arrangements from IAIL2 areas, including
lessons learned, were reflected and incorporated in the project design. For example, the


                                             21
initiative of farmer-created and farmer-managed WUAs and FAs to grow specialty crops,
in many cases using WUA-managed water, was incorporated into the project design.
Bank supervision missions also included specialists as needed to support these early,
informal preparation activities, including introducing the concept of “real? water savings.
In addition, the project and PPRWRP have been closely associated, and the early Bank
technical assistance missions for PPRWRP provided specialized expertise and input on
WUAs for project preparation. Many of the lessons from PPRWRP, such as the Five
Principles for improved WUAs as developed under PPRWRP, were built into the project,
including incorporating these provisions into the legal agreements and project MIS for
monitoring during implementation. Similarly, to ensure that the MIS and WUA-MES for
the project were compatible with PPRWRP and to enable the project MIS and WUA-
MES to be operational as soon as possible, PPRWRP funded the initial costs for
adaptation and transfer of the PPRWRP MIS and WUA-MES to SOCAD. During
preparation, PPRWRP also provided critical training to project staff on improved WUAs
and related topics such as women participation.

GEF-SCCF Project. The Bank team and SOCAD were highly proactive in seizing the
opportunity to introduce climate adaptation approach into the IBRD project measures
through the companion GEF-SCCF project. Extensive preparation work was done well
ahead of project appraisal to ensure that the project content was realistic and doable.
Given the small size of the grant, the team focused more on the intellectual integrity of
the approach, including limited field demonstrations and mainstreaming climate
adaptation into the overall CAD program. It used the IBRD project innovatively to
provide counterpart funding to implement the identified agro-ecologically appropriate
climate adaptation measures.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank supervision missions successfully assisted SOCAD and the provinces in identifying
and resolving issues that could threaten the achievement of the project development
outcomes. Supervision missions included international experts for specialized topics,
such as water saving techniques, WUAs, FAs/FCs, green food, climate change adaptation,
and gender-based training. These experts brought fresh perspectives and new ideas to the
project and, at the same time, critically reviewed implementation performance, and
helped to identify and resolve any problems.

The Bank’s PPRWRP technical assistance missions provided direct support for improved
WUAs. The PPRWRP also provided substantial training and technical assistance to
project staff and farmers (especially women farmers) on WUAs, the project MIS and the
WUA-M&E. Bank missions effectively supervised fiduciary and safeguard compliance
and adjusted project’s water-saving and agricultural modernization components to
incorporate climate change adaptation approaches. The Bank missions recommended, at
an appropriate time, to restructure the project to address exchange rate variations, slow
progress of some components, and the complementary financing of some project
activities through government programs. Bank missions served as a continuous source of


                                            22
positive feedback and generated a productive working relationship and close partnership
between the Bank and SOCAD.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team strongly supported and facilitated project preparation which was
completed early and to a high standard, allowing the pre-appraisal to be upgraded to
appraisal. The Bank also strongly supported implementation through regular and high
quality supervision missions which reviewed implementation performance and
recommended critical actions to ensure the achievement of project development
outcomes. The Bank facilitated and supported introduction of climate change adaptation
activities into the project during implementation, and coordinated PPRWRP activities to
provide strong support to the project on improved WUAs during preparation and
implementation, as well as introducing gender-based training for both the project staff
and WUAs members. No opportunity for restructuring was lost, and the two projects
were brought to an orderly closure.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Government’s strong support for the project and its objectives from preparation
through completion was a key factor in the success of this large, complex and innovative
project. The government strongly supported the project’s project development outcomes
during both preparation and implementation, and continuously demonstrated a strong
ownership and commitment to project objectives, in relation to both the IBRD and GEF-
SCCF projects. At approval of the IBRD project, the government had already provided
for strong project leadership and implementation arrangements, already had staff in place,
and had begun some key activities under retroactive financing. SOCAD’s leadership to
the preparation of the IBRD and GEF-SCCF projects, with strong participation by the
POCADs, COCADs, and PMOs, was exemplary.

With government support, implementation issues were resolved quickly, often using the
project MIS and MES to speed problem identification and help guide decision making
and resource allocation. This support was especially clear in provision of adequate
counterpart funding especially in the face of strong Yuan appreciation, and in policy
support such as the recent Cooperatives Law which relates to FA and FC activities under
the project and SOCAD support for MWR’s guidelines on WUAs (Circular 502) under
the project.. This provided a strong enabling environment for key institutional reforms
under the project, which was reinforced at the field level by the many policy documents
issues by local governments in support of these reforms. For many project activities,
such as WUAs and FAs/FCs, a strong, effective program of stakeholder consultation was



                                           23
carried out as standard practice, and stakeholders were directly involved in
implementation and arrangements for O&M after completion.

SOCAD paid especially close attention to fiduciary issues, in particular ensuring effective
and strong financial management, establishment and efficient operation of the project
MIS at project start-up, adequate and timely flow of loan and counterpart funding, close
monitoring of loan and counterpart funds use, loan reimbursements and fulfillment of
covenants.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The performance of SOCAD and lower level CAD offices and PMOs in preparing and
implementing the project was outstanding. Management and leadership of the overall
project by SOCAD’s CPMO has been excellent, innovative and efficient, and has
demonstrated a strong commitment to and good understanding of project development
objectives and outcomes, while lower levels of project management have efficiently
implemented project activities to secure expected project outcomes. Effective and
efficient leadership and support at both levels were key factors in the project’s high level
of success. Throughout preparation and implementation, project management has shown
a strong commitment to achieving project development outcomes and objectives, and has
maintained an effective program of stakeholder consultation and involvement, especially
with farmers, local officials and WRB staff as well as CAD field staff.

The high level of support and commitment for the project was evident from the
beginning; preparation was efficient, and the project was fully ready for implementation
at Board approval with all implementation arrangements and key staff already in place.
During implementation, issues were resolved quickly and efficiently; financial
management, procurement, reimbursement, compliance with covenants and other
fiduciary requirements were met effectively, and effective M&E arrangements were
established and used effectively to help guide project management.               During
implementation, close relationships with related line agencies such as the WRBs, local
governments and villages/farmers were maintained. This not only facilitated efficient
implementation but also helped ensure effective arrangements for continued operation of
project activities after project completion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Both the government and SOCAD performance was excellent in preparing and
implementing the project, displaying a strong commitment to the project and its
objectives, and providing effective leadership and policy support to ensure success in
meeting project objectives.

6. Lessons Learned

   (a) The project has demonstrated that it is possible to provide a climate adaptation
       focus to most water and agriculture-related investments. Using small water
       harvesting tanks, additional extended channels, drainage lines to collect water for
       later use, recycling crop residues for soil moisture conservation, using pest
       tolerant seeds, precision application of fertilizers or pesticides, adjusting cropping
       pattern and crop-mix, among other measures have a huge climate adaptation
       impact and should indeed become an integral part of all projects focused on
       increasing water efficiency or agricultural modernization. Even with on-going
       agriculture and irrigation projects, retrofitting an already existing program to
       include integrated measures with a climate adaptation focus is not difficult.

   (b) The usual approach to intensification of irrigated agriculture is investment in
       infrastructure, in many cases, completely new. The project has demonstrated that
       identifying ways to improve efficiency of the water resource already available,
       obtaining “real? water savings, and improving water productivity should be the
       approach. This can be achieved with minimal investment, with huge gains to be
       realized.

   (c) It is eminently desirable to ensure that there are activities focused on knowledge
       generation, analyses, capacity building, and creation of an intellectual
       underpinning for an innovative operation which incorporates climate adaptation.
       An analysis of the impacts of climate change, nature of measures that may be
       required for adaptation, tailoring these to specific ago-ecological and climatic
       zones, and demonstrating the benefits for wider adoption is central to achieving
       adaptation objectives. The project used the GEF-SCCF grant for these activities
       and limited demonstrations. It was thus able to get a huge impact from a
       companion project by deploying the resources from a small grant.

   (d) It is critical to get all of the stakeholders to buy into the program. The project was
       able to work in a participatory mode with the provincial and county level
       command agriculture development program offices, with the scientific and
       research community, with the farmers and their associations, and with
       agriculture/water/forestry bureaus to develop a common and acceptable approach
       to climate adaptation menu of options. Dissemination of information to civil
       society and to government officials and political leaders to obtain their support to
       implement such initiatives was a key success factor.

   (e) Strengthened cooperation with research institutions and scientists and experts, and
       timely transformation of the latest research on climate change adaptation into
       practical action provided strong scientific and technical support for project design
       and implementation, and guided adaptation practices on the ground. The SCCF
       grant was used to contract top research institutions in China and the first-class
       international experts in the field to build up the scientific base for project design




                                            25
       and implementation, a new path of using scientific assessment to guide
       investment practices.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower indicated that a number of key factors were behind the success of the
Project: strong attention paid to project implementation by the government at various
levels; well-established institutions and close cooperation among concerned agencies; a
well-established institutional system for management; scientific and meticulous project
planning and design; active participation by the farmers; and focus on science and
technology dissemination and technical training under the project. The issues associated
with implementation included: exchange rate fluctuation made it difficult for project
implementation; price contingencies used by the Bank was not easy to understand by the
implementing agencies; and data requirements under the project demanded significant
amount of manpower and effort.

(b) Co-financiers
None.

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1 Financial and Economic Evaluation
Economic benefits of the project were mainly derived from increase in agricultural
outputs after improvement of basic infrastructure, and from expansion of cultivated areas
of high value-added crops and the resulted increase of the crops’ yield. Financial analysis
of the project was mainly based on data from annual project monitoring, while taking into
account assumptions at appraisal to ensure comparability of data at appraisal and ICR.
The analysis mainly applied the following assumptions:

   1)      Economic evaluation of the project was conducted in accordance with the
           principles and methods defined in the of the World Bank guidelines, and is
           based on market prediction and analysis, project construction scale,
           components and investment estimates;
   2)      Since this project was designed to be an irrigated agriculture project, it
           produced a certain amount of economic benefits through improvement of low
           and medium yield farmland and agro-production conditions, adjustment of
           cropping pattern, increase of high yield farmland and cropping area of good
           quality varieties. Therefore, the project was in nature a rehabilitation and
           expansion project, its economic benefits were analyzed by comparing the
           incremental benefits of the “with project? and “without project? scenarios;
   3)      Based on price tendency of agro-products in recent years, average market
           prices of 2008 were used for the main agro-products;
   4)      Financial benchmark yield and social discount rate were both set at 12%;
   5)      Project calculation period was 20 years, including 5 years of implementation
           period, and the base year was 2005;
   6)      Unit yield of each of the crops was based on results of typical investigations
           of the project area, representing an average level of the whole project area.
           Data of field surveys in 2003 were used for the “without project? scenario.
           The outputs consisted of main products and by-products. Inputs for each of
           the crops included seed, pesticide, chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer,
           plastic film, machinery cost, water charge, labor, animal power, agricultural
           taxes, etc., as the case might be;
   7)      According to results of surveys by the provinces and actual situation with
           IAIL2, after completion of the project, stable yields come in starting from year
           3 or year 4 for crops; for forestry, the starting year of stable yields ranges from
           year 6 to year 9. Since the project implementation lasted 5 years, stable yields
           would start from year 14 for the whole project area;
   8)      Agricultural tax: The national government had issued policy on exemption of
           agricultural tax. The provinces calculated their own agro-taxes based on actual
           situation with agro-tax exemption in their respective provinces,
   9)      Taxes and price contingencies were omitted in economic evaluation. A
           comprehensive tax rate of 5% was used for civil works investment, and
   10)     Financial analysis of the project was for the whole project based on cash flow
           analyses by the provinces.




                                             34
Results from the analysis show that Financial Internal Return Rate (FIRR) is 17.3%,
Financial Net Present Value (FNPV) is 2,378 million yuan, indicating financial
sustainability of the project. FIRR of the project is slightly lower than that planned at
appraisal and the main reason for this is great increase of labor cost in China in recent

Economic analysis of the project was based on financial analysis, with the following
differences also taken into account:

       1)        Prices used in the economic analysis: After China’s accession to the
                 World Trade Organization (WTO), its prices of agro-products and
                 agricultural means of production are gradually integrated with those in
                 international markets. Therefore, economic analysis of the project used the
                 same prices as they were in financial analysis;
       2)        Economic Costs of the Project: COSTAB was used to omit taxes and price
                 contingencies from the project investment and calculate conversion factor
                 of economic costs of the project; and
       3)        A social discount rate of 12% was used for economic analysis.

Using the above mentioned assumptions and references, the calculated Economic Internal
Return Rate (EIRR) of the whole project is 25.3%, and Economic Net Present Value
(ENPV) is RMB2,877 million, both of which are close to those estimated at appraisal.
Such results indicate that the project is economically sound. Table 3.2 that follows
contains more details.

3.2 Greatly Improved Basic Agro-Production Conditions and Substantially
Increased Yields of Agro-products
Before the project implementation, most of the farmland in the project areas was in poor
irrigation condition and some farmland was not leveled, with undulating surface and poor
water and nutrient retaining capacities, which, coupled with extensive farming and
irrigation practice, resulted in waste of water and soil erosion. Through project
implementation, on-farm water conservancy facilities in the project areas had been
completed and matched with auxiliary structures, and anti-disasters (drought, floods)
capacities of the farmland had been obviously strengthened, thus a foundation for
increased production of grain and cash crops was established. Over the five-year project
implementation, total output and unit yields of the main crops in the project areas had
been enhanced to various degrees. Compared with that in base year, unit yield of grain
crops reached 6,381 kg/ha, and total grain output reached 4.20 million tons, with an
increase of one million tons, being 100.2% of that planned at appraisal. Total output of
cash crops reached 4.578 million tons, with an increase of 220 thousand tons, being
105.1% of that planned at appraisal. Because of the improved production condition,
multiple planting index in the project area increased by 4%, from 183% at appraisal to
187%.

3.3 Further Optimized Cropping Mix and Apparently Upgraded Quality of Agro-
products
Along with improvement of basic agro-production conditions, the project encouraged
adjustment of cropping mix by farmers, and relied on scientific advancement to promote
development of modern, highly efficient agriculture. In the project areas, planting areas
of good quality agro-products and high value cash crops were noticeably increased,
which facilitated shift of traditional agriculture to high yield, good quality, and high
efficiency agriculture. Monitoring results of the provinces indicate that, there was an
apparent adjustment of cropping mix in the project areas after the project implementation,
and the ratio of grain crops to cash crops in the project areas changed greatly, with
planting area of cash crops increased by 2% to 4% after the project implementation,
being about 3% higher than that in the “control areas? (areas selected for comparison
purpose) in the non-project areas. For details see Table 3.3.

Because of their environmental and price advantages of non-polluting, green and organic
agro-products, production and development of such agro-products has been well accepted
by the local governments and the vast number of farmers in the project areas as an
important aspect for agricultural restructuring. Statistics show that, in the recent 5 years,
totally 250 agro-products produced in the project areas were certified as non-polluting
agro-products, 117 agro-products were certified as green food, and 18 agro-products were
in the conversion period for organic food certification, all of which indicate that the
project effectively promoted development of good quality, high efficient agriculture.
Among them, certification of 99 green products was supported by IAIL-3, covering a
total area of 17,972 ha. See Table 3.4 for more details.

 3.4 Markedly Increased Farmer Incomes
Increase of agricultural outputs and restructuring of cropping mix greatly facilitated
increase of farmer incomes. Per capita net income (including non-agricultural income) of
farmers in the project area increased to 5138 yuan from 3,406 yuan at appraisal,
accounting for 150.9% of that at appraisal. According to analysis of farming incomes of
the representative farmer households in 5 provinces, after project implementation, per


                                             37
capita income of households with high incomes increased to 3,742 yuan from 2,464 yuan
at appraisal, accounting for 151.9% of that at appraisal; per capita income of households
with medium incomes increased to 3,067 yuan from 1.423 yuan at appraisal, being
155.3% of that at appraisal; per capita income of households with low incomes increased
to 2,541 yuan from 1,135 yuan at appraisal, being 156.5% of that at appraisal; per capita
income of households producing green agro-products increased to 4,639 yuan from 3,423
yuan at appraisal, accounting for 135.5% of that at appraisal; per capita income of
households involved in farmer specialized cooperative organizations increased to 4,031
yuan from 2,231 yuan at appraisal, being 180.6% of that at appraisal; per capita income
of households included in pilot FCs increased to 4,160 yuan from 2,637 yuan at appraisal,
being 157.7% of that at appraisal.

Through analysis of incomes of representative households in the project area, it is clear
that, the project resulted in higher growth rate of incomes for farmers in the project area,
compared with that of farmers in similar areas in the same period.

3.5 Rapid Development of WUAs and the Resulted Notable Benefits to the Members
As an important managerial water-saving measure, WUA development was greatly
accelerated under the project, with extended area coverage and notable benefits brought
to the association members. Results of monitoring conducted specifically on the WUAs
in consecutive years show that, along with WUAs’ establishment and putting into
operation, unit yield of crops and farmers’ income in the areas with WUAs established
tended to increase year by year. At the end stage of the monitoring, incremental yield of
crops of the WUAs ranged from 5 to 32 kg per mu on average, and the annual unit yields
of the WUAs were 9 to 177 kg higher than those of the control group; per capita annual
income of the households involved in the WUAs ranged from 5,318 yuan to 12,131 yuan,
including 2,773 yuan to 5,366 yuan of farm income, and the incremental per capita
annual incomes of households in the WUA areas and those in non-WUA areas ranged
from 130 yuan to 1,437 yuan and from 58 to 766 yuan, respectively. Additionally,
establishment and operation of WUAs facilitated, to a certain extent, a rise out of poverty
of the poor population, as was shown by the increase of farm incomes of the poor
households. At the final stage of monitoring, income of poor households included in the
WUAs of the 5 project provinces ranged from 1,282 yuan to 2,414 yuan, with an increase
between 25 yuan and 410 yuan; per capita farm income of the poor households in the
WUAs of the 5 provinces ranged from 1.024 yuan to 1,221 yuan, with an increase
between 42 yuan and 382 yuan.

 COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER/RECIPIENT ON THE DRAFT
                   ICR ON DECEMBER 10, 2012

“We are pleased to receive and review the WB ICR which integrate the Irrigated
Intensification Agriculture Loan III (IAIL 3) project and the Mainstreaming Climate
Change Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture (GEF) Project, because of the implementation of
GEF project blended with IAIL 3 project. We think the ICR totally and truly reflect the
actual implementation of two projects, objectively and fairly evaluate the achievements,
lessons and impacts of two projects. We have no objection to ICR.

We highly appreciate the hard work and great effects of the task team leader and the
related experts. All of them did a great contribution for the successful implementation of
both projects.

SOCAD?

  SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR FOR THE IAIL3 PROJECT (prepared by the
                            Bank)

The Borrower prepared a comprehensive and a very good ICR. The first time was during
the November 2010, IAIL 3 Supervision Mission and the second time was during the
GEF CC Project Supervision Mission in March/April 2011. SOCAD prepared the
Borrower final ICR Report which was submitted to the Bank on May 1, 2011 (a copy of
the Report is kept the project files). The Borrower confirmed that the design of IAIL3
components closely centered around the PDOs and emphasized innovations in the project
design and those introduced during project implementation, while taking into full
consideration the real needs of the farmers, agriculture sector and rural development in
the project areas; and timely introduction of climate change adaptation concepts into
IAIL3 at MTR that made overall design of the project components more scientific and
rational.

The Borrower indicated that a number of key factors were behind the strong success of
the Project, especially: strong attention paid to project implementation by the government
at various levels; well-established institutions and close cooperation among concerned
agencies; a well-established institutional system for management (based on IAIL2
experience) and standardized management; scientific and meticulous project planning
and design; active participation by the farmers, which was strongly promoted and
supported under the project; and stressing science and technology dissemination and
technical training under the project. Other factors include the following:

   (i)     Government commitment to repay the laon: SOCAD requested US$ 200
           million loan from the World Bank to co-finance the project. MOF (the
           borrower) committed to repay the loan. The finance departments at various
           levels committed to provide counterpart funding to the project;



                                           43
   (ii)    Policy support: in addition to the commitment of loan repayment, provision of
           counterpart funding and the establishment of project management institutions,
           GOC has also provided policy support in various areas, including the issuance
           of series of documents in favor of project implementation;

   (iii)   Active participation by the beneficiaries. Farmers in the project area are the
           direct beneficiaries of the project. PMOs at various levels guided project
           farmers to actively participate in the whole process of project preparation,
           construction and maintenance, enabling them to become the owners of the
           project development, which is one of the important factors that impacted on
           the implementation achievements of the project; and

   (iv)    Effective contribution to the project design by the World Bank and effective
           supervision by the World Bank. The Borrower highly valued the guidance,
           advice and the technical input by the Bank’s missions at project preparation
           and during supervision. Accordingly, the World Bank performance was rated
           “Higly Satisfactory? by the Borrower.

The Borrower’s ICR also included a number of comments on the issues associated with
the project implementation. They include the following:

   (i)     Large exchange rate changes during the project period caused substantial
           difficulties for project implementation;

   (ii)    Variable rates for price contingencies based on the Bank’s methodology were
           used for making the annual project budgets, but this was beyond the
           understanding and capacity of the local implementing agencies and the
           cost/budget estimates were far from actual costs.

   (iii)   Data requirements under the project for monitoring, analysis, etc. were
           extensive and required a significant amount of organized manpower and effort.
           However, M&E and other data intensive activities were not treated like full
           project components, which made it difficult to manage data collection and use
           properly; for example, changes in personnel results in loose handling and loss
           of data in some cases.

To address the above issues, the Report recommended the following actions to be taken
into consideration in future projects:

   (i) The World Bank in future project implementation should explore more scientific
       project management method. From the perspectives of the PMOs, project
       activities should be scientifically phased. Project management should be
       strengthened to speed up the implementation. Reimbursement should be carried
       out timely so as to reduce the loss caused by foreign exchange rate variations;




                                           44
(ii) The World Bank should take into consideration more accurate estimates of
     inflation; adopt fixed calculation methods for the two contingencies to facilitate
     the budgeting work of the project implementers; and

(iii)Special attention should be given to collection, storage and use of data from the
     very beginning of project preparation, stability of the project data management
     staff should be maintained as it is for other project components, and proper
     transition from old to new data management personnel should be ensured. M&E
     and other data related activities should be treated as full project components in
     order to get the attention they need.

      SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR FOR THE GEF-SCCF PROJECT
                  (Borrower’s contribution: un-edited)


1.      Project overview
The Yellow River, Huaihe River and Haihe River Basin (3H River Basin) is one of the
three largest river basins of China, covering an area of 1.44 million km2. The 3H River
Basin is also an important agricultural economic region and one of the major producing
areas of grains and cotton of China. In recent years, the impact of climate change on
agricultural production in the 3H River Basin becomes increasingly evident. Therefore,
SOCAD started at the end of 2006 the preparation of requesting GEF grant for the
implementation of adaptation to climate change in comprehensive agricultural
development.

The proposal for the grant project envisaged the use of 5 million USD of GEF. In order
for the grant project to achieve the effects of seed funding and to leverage more resources,
SOCAD used the balance of 50.5 million USD of the then on-going IAIL3 of the World
Bank as counterpart funds to be implemented in tandem with the grant project. The 5
million USD of GEF fund served as a harbinger to improve and address the weakness in
terms of adaptation to climate change in the design of IAIL3, and the investment of 5
million USD also served as a platform and provided broader space to the introduction and
practical application and popularization of the rationales of adaptation to climate change.
The investment and activities of the grant program have been implemented as pilots in
the 10 counties with climate conditions identical to the surrounding areas, i.e. Changxian
County of Hebei, Xinyi Municipal and Suoyu District of Suoqian Municipal of Jiangsu,
Mingguan Municipal and Huaiyuan County of Anhui, Yanggu County and Gaomi
Municipal of Shandong, Wancheng District of Nanyang Municipal and Liangyuan
District of Shangqiu of Henan, and Tongxin County of Ningxia. Activities of the grant
project included adaptation measures with good ripping effects, replicability and
accuracy of targeting as the construction of rainfall harvesting works, demonstration of
agricultural technologies with climate adaptability, demonstration of crop varieties with
adaptability to climate change, demonstration of biogas digesters and greenhouses.

The overall objective of the grant project aimed at the incorporation of the rationales of
adaptation to climate change in the fields of water resource management and agricultural
development. Through activities of enhancing awareness, demonstration of adaptation
measures and institutional capacity building, the project would for the first time increase
the capacity of adapting to climate change in agricultural production in the 3H River
Basin. Furthermore, through capturing lessons learnt in the practice, the project would
provide exemplary demonstrations and recommendations of actions for the adoption of
the rationales of adaptation to climate change in larger scope.

2.      Project management and implementation
The setup of the implementation institution of the grant project used the same team of
IAIL3, which meant that the PMOs at various levels of the IAIL3 were also responsible
for the implementation of the grant project. Meanwhile, in line with the characteristics of


                                            46
the grant project, PMOs at various levels established mobile expert groups, through
which, experts of various disciplines contributed technical support and guidance to
project implementation, providing adequate human resource guarantee to the integration
of the grant project and IAIL3.
By the end of June 2012, project implementers had completed project activities reaching
or exceeding major output indicators.

3.     Assessment of outcomes
The grant project has delivered all activities and the objective has been achieved.

(1)      PMOs at all levels have used multiple media to extensively disseminate the
objective, rationales of project design and the outcomes of the project. Multiple media
and channels have been adopted to increase the awareness about the rationales of
adaptation to climate change.
(2)      On the basis of capturing the effects of the application of various adaptation
measures, PMOs of all levels in line with the actuality of the project area of the province
actively promoted and strengthened adaptation to climate change in agriculture and
irrigation management.
(3)      PMOs at all levels shared the experiences of adaptation to climate change of the
demonstration counties and adopted relevant measures of adaptation to climate change in
the project area of IAIL3 in an all round manner.

In accordance with the project implementation plan, project activities have been timely
and efficiently carried out and realized the intended objective of the project. County
PMOs focused on the implementation and demonstration of adaptation measures. The
national and provincial PMOs delivered training and study tours and organized related
consulting service providers to efficiently carry out studies on related subjects. Policy
recommendations were proposed for comprehensive agricultural development to adapt to
climate change. These activities have provided technical support and theoretical
foundation for mainstreaming of adaptation to climate change in comprehensive
agricultural development.

The implementation of the grant project has achieved good outcomes and fully realized
the PDO in an overall manner.

   •   Firstly, project’s actions and demonstrations of adaptation measures inspired
       actions of adaptation to climate change and provided references in comprehensive
       agricultural development.
   •   Secondly, through subject matter studies, the project established a checklist of
       adaptation measures to climate change and policy guideline in comprehensive
       agricultural development.
   •   Thirdly, through extensive information dissemination and training, the rationales
       of adaptation to climate change have been accepted by government officials of
       various levels and farmers of the project area and reflected and implemented on
       the ground.




                                            47
As illustrated above, the activities of the grant projects have been fully delivered and the
PDO has been realized. Therefore, the project is rated as highly satisfactory through the
assessment of the grant recipient side.

4.      Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes
In the process of project identification, PMOs of all levels fully considered various
factors faced by the project. Effective measures were adopted to enhance the soundness
of project identification, which laid solid foundation to the smooth delivery of the project.
The smooth delivery of the project is attributable to the efforts of the management of the
PMOs at all levels and to the intellectual support of the mobile expert groups, as well as
the positive impact of the external environment.

In order to accurately master project implementation progress, timely uncover and
resolve issues occurred in project implementation, assess the quality of project
implementation and the results and outcomes the project produced and ensure correct
decision making and effective monitoring of the PMOs at all level, the M&E indicators
were identified at project preparation with full consultation with the World Bank. M&E
system was established in which procedures and schedule of project inspection,
supervision and audit were clearly defined. M&E and supervision in project
implementation were efficiently carried out.

5.     Challenges faced
In order to ensure the sustainability of the project and fully achieve the ripping effects of
the project, PMOs at all levels made overall sustainability arrangement during project
implementation and after completion.

(1) Sustainability of project works
After certification of completion acceptance, CPMOs following the stipulations of fixed
asset management have completed the hand-over formalities for the works and facilities
as small-scale rainfall harvesting works, biogas digesters and greenhouses.
(2) Sustainability of institutional capacity
During project implementation, POCAD systems have gradually established the
mainstream framework of adaptation to climate change.
(3) Sustainability of policies
In recent years, governments at all levels have attached more and more attention to issues
of climate change and formulated and issued one after another policy documents in
relation to climate change, forming a policy support framework of national, local
governments and line agencies.

6.     Risk analysis
Since the possible risks of the project had been fully considered during project appraisal
with corresponding counter measures formulated, the risks during project implementation
had been effectively resolved, enabling the project to fully realize its PDO.

(1) Additional risk during project implementation and coping measures



                                             48
In line with the additional risks appeared during project implementation, effective counter
measures have been timely taken and there were no significant impact on the project.
(2) Post-completion risk analysis and coping measures
After completion of project implementation, there are certain risks for the sustainable
development of the project, a challenge to the sustainable development of project
outcomes. Through analyzing these risks and adoption of effective counter measures, the
probability of such risks can be mitigated or completely avoided.

7.        Performance of the World Bank and the recipient

(1) Assessment of World Bank’s performance

During project preparation and implementation, the World Bank brought in advanced
design rationales and project management experiences and timely and effectively guided
the recipient to undertake project preparation and implementation; it hence played
positive role in upgrading project implementation and management of the recipient. Its
performance in fulfilling the legal agreement of the project is highly satisfactory. The
performance of the World Bank is rated as highly satisfactory.

(2) Assessment of recipient’s performance

During project preparation and implementation, the performance of the recipient is highly
satisfactory.

8.        Lessons learnt and recommendations

8.1       Experiences

(1)     Meticulous and solid project preparation provided important foundation to smooth
delivery of the project.
 (2)    Strong technical support is indispensable guarantee to smooth delivery of the
project.
 (3)    Project management in accordance with relevant stipulations was the fundamental
(4)     Participatory approach is an important path to smooth project implementation.

8.2       Lessons

The project even though has achieved good results and fully reached the planned PDO,
there are inadequacies as follows:

      •   Firstly, the amount of SCCF grant is small and the application of adaptation
          measure is not sufficiently comprehensive.
      •   Secondly, due to the limited grant amount, the scale of the GEF CC adaptation
          project is small with limited scope of exploration of adaptation measures.




                                            49
8.3    Recommendations

When implementing future projects, recipient recommends that the successful
experiences of the project be fully used and lessons learnt in project implementation be
captured so as to continuously improve project design and implementation.
