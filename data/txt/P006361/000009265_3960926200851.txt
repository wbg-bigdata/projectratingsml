BRAZIL
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. LOAN AtMD PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           The Federative Republic of brazil.
Beneficiaries:     Accredited participating banks (PBs).
Loan Amount:        US$300 million equivalent.
Terms:              Repayable in 15 years on a fixed amortization schedule,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
Onlending
Terms:              The terms on which the Government would make loan funds
available to the PBs have been designed to enable the
Government to recover from the PBs the full costs,
including foreign exchange risks, of the Bank loan plus
the administrative costs. The final onlending terms to
subborrowers would be a market outcome based on the
negotiations between the PBs and their customers.
Proiect
Objectives:         To initiate the process of liberalizing farm credit
through the introduction of a completely commercial
investment credit line for farmers while simultaneously
contracting the supply of official (interest rate-
controlled) credit to the agricultural sector.
Proiect
Description:        Bank loan funds would be used by the Treasury (STN) to
refinance (discount) subloans made by PBs to farmers to
finance their fixed investment and associated working
capital requirements. All Banks in Brazil which are
accredited by the Central Bank (CB) as being financially
sound and having the appropriate loan appraisal/
management capability would be eligible to participate.
World Bank funds would finance up to 50? of subproject
investment and associated working capital costs; PBs and
subborrowers would finance the balance, with their
respective shares being negotiated between them.

Risks:             At present the demand for investment farm credit, as for
-                  most investment credit, although positive and
potentially high, is depressed due to the uncertain
economic environment.  However, in determining the size
of the proposed Bank loan, account was taken of these
factors.  Furthermore, recent Government commitments to
reducing the fiscal deficit, in its efforts to stabilize
the economy, and the renewed dialogue with the IMF are
encouraging signs.  Another risk is the competition from
official subsidized credit which could also reduce the
demand for the project's commercial credit funds;
however, the Government is comitted to reducing the
supply of official credit to the agricultural sector and
has begun to implement a program to this end -- a
program that will be regularly monitored and reviewed
annually with the Bank.
Estimated Costs:                                              US$ million
Investments and associated working capital                    600

II. THE SECTOR CONTEXT
A. Agriculture in the Economy
2.01     During the 1970s, the total area planted to crops in Brazil rose
at 3.3Z per year and sectoral GDP grew at an annual average rate of 62.
This high growth rate was fueled primarily by the development of export
crops (soybeans, citrus, tobacco, coffee and cocoa) and, in the latter part
of the decade, by sugarcane production for the alcohol program. Total
agricultural exports rose from US$2.03 billion in 1970 to US$9.43 billion
in 1980. Production was particularly dynamic in the expanding frontier
states of the Center-West (Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul and parts of Minas
Gerais) but also grew steadily in the traditional agricultural states of
the South.
2.02     After 1980, the sector entered a period of relative stagnation and
slow growth, caused in part by sector-specific Government intervention
(trade and price controls), overall macroeconomic management difficulties
and by falling world commodity prices. The total area planted to crops in
Brazil grew at only 1.7Z per year between 1980 and 1986 (compared to 3.3X
in the previous decade), and the output of many basic food crops (wheat,
maize, cassava, potatoes, rice, beans, meat and milk) remained relatively
constant and rose only modestly in 1984 and 1985, with the result that per-
capita food production declined significantly and food imports increased.
Agricultural exports exhibited a similar pattern, with virtually little or
no growth since 1980, except in 1984 when coffee and orange juice were
aided by favorable price movements. In 1987, rising domestic agricultural
prices, coupled with favorable weather conditions, contributed to a record
grain harvest of 65 million mt. Presently agriculture accounts for about
122 of GDP, 302 of employment and 332 of exports.
B. Parm Subsector
2.03     Based on the 1985 Agricultural and Livestock Census, it is
estimated that there are nearly six million farm establishments in Brazil
with about helf (48Z) located in the Northeast, 21Z in the South, 172 in
the Southeast, 9Z in the North and about 52 in the Center-West. Of the
total farm area of about 380 million ha, the Center-West, where there are
many large ranches, accounts for the largest share (31Z), followed by the
Northeast (242), the Southeast (20Z), the South (132), and the North (12Z).
The vast majority of farm establishments in the Northeast are less than
10 ha, whereas in the South and Southeast, a significant proportion of the
farms are in the 200 to 1000 ha range (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2).
2.04     With respect to the value of crop production, the South and
Southeast account for the greatest share (702) followed by the Northeast
(17Z), the Center West (92) and the North (4Z) (Annex 1, Table 3).
Using these figures and the estimated number of farm establishments,
average gross farm revenue (not including livestock income) in 1985 is



-4-
roughly estimated at Cr$ 38,000 (US$6,129) for the South and Southeast,
Cr$ 34,000 (US$5,484) for the Center-West, Cr$ 10,000 (US$1,613) for the
North, and Cr$ 7,500 (US$1,210) for the Northeast. The relatively
prosperous farms in the Southeast produce the majority of the country's
export and industrial crops (coffee, sugarcane and cotton) while the farms
in the South and Center-West are heavily concentrated in grains and account
for almost all of the wheat and soybean production and over half the maize
and rice production in the country. The farms in the Northeast primarily
produce food crops, including rice, maize, cassava and beans, although
sugarcane, cotton and cocoa are also important crops (Annex 2, Table 4).
C. Banking and Credit
2.05     There about 100 banks in Brazil, of which about 80 are private and
20 are owned by the federal and state governments; these banks have a
network of some 15,000 branches, of which the private banks account for
about 8,500. Supervision of the banking system is the responsibility of
the Central Bank (CB). The CB has improved the quality of its supervisory
work in the last several years by focusing attention on the overall
solvency positions of the banks and not just on their compliance with CB
regulations. Further progress is needed, however, in providing improved
regulations for the classification of l1-ans by default risk, for the
provision of potential loan losses and for the treatment of interest
accruals on doubtful loans.  In addition, financially troubled state banks
often do not comply with CB regulations. These weaknesses have been
identified in the context of the Bank's current sector work and are
intended to be addressed in a proposed financial sector operation now under
preparation.
2.06     All credit in Brazil is of two major types: "official" (which is
interest rate-controlled and administratively allocated and, therefore,
subject to various political pressures); and "commercial" (which is
supplied voluntarily at market determined rates). Official credit
comprises the bulk (presently nearly 90Z) of all agricultural (frequently
referred to as rural) credit. The major sources of official rural credit
have beens (i) compulsory applications (the requirement that a fixed
percentage of sight (demand) deposits in all commercial banks be used for
official rural credit); (ii) Government budgetary allocations (channelled
mostly through the federal commercial bank -- Bank of Brazil (BB); (iii)
the rediscount facilities of the Central Bank (CB), often with the
assistance of multi/bilateral funds; and (iv) more recently (since 1987),
the interest-bearing rural savings deposits held in BB and a few other
federal and regional banks. Official interest rates are determined by the
Monetary Council and have usually been well below market rates. For
example, throughout most of the present decade the gap between official
rates and market rates, as measured by the cost of Government Treasury
bonds, has been in the order of at least 15 percentage points a year on
loan balances, except in the North and Northeast where this gap has been
much larger, reflecting the lower official rates charged. The fact that
commercial banks are obliged to lend a percentage of their sight deposits
at controlled rates, leads them to set market rates at leve&s which are



-5-
generally higher than what they would otherwise be. Subborrowers often
receive a blended rate, with some funds under official terms and some under
market terms, effectively resulting in an average or "blended" rate
(para. 2.14). Official rural credit includes: (a) short-term (inputs)
credit, typically accounting for some 60Z of the total; (b) short-term
marketing credit which accounts for about 25X; and (c) medium- and long-
term investment credit (over 12 months), accounting for about 15Z.
2.07     During the 1950s and 1960s the volume of official rural credit was
small but it rose fourfold in real terms between 1969 and 1975. It then
remained relatively stable through 1982, declined by about half durirg 1983
and 1984, rose in 1985 and increased greatly in 1986 before declining
rapidly in 1987 to about US$8.2 billion (a decrease of 41? in real terms
compared with the preceding year) owing to the reduced availability of
funds (sight deposits) for compulsory applications and the erosion of
credit portfolios in the banks when indexation of financial assets was both
suspended for a short time and later, when it was restored, fell well short
of inflation. The volume of official rural credit by source over the last
couple of years is shown in Annex 2, Table 1.
2.08     Although during 1987, the volume of official rural credit declined
in real terms (as discussed in the above para.) and interest rates rose
(currently 9Z for short-term and 7X for investment with indexation), the
burden of credit subsidies has become unsustainable for the Government.1
Consequently, the Govermnent has indicated it would welcome Bank assistance
to help liberalize credit markets in the agricultural sector by expanding
the supply of commercial credit, while the Government reduces the supply of
official credit to the sector. The Government's three-year program to
reduce official credit to the agricultural sector is shcwn in Annex 2,
Table 2.
2.09     As can be seen from this table, the Government's program to
contract official credit to the agricultural sector over the next three
years (1988-1990) represents a significant move in the right direction,
with cuts in real terms in 1990 (compared to 1987 -- an already relatively
low base year) reaching 222 for long-term (investment) rural credit, 122
for short-term (inputs and marketing) rural credit, 19? for agro-industrial
investment credit supplied by BNDES, and the complete elimination of the
Government's discount facility for supplying agro-industrial credit. The
Government's own contributions to long- and short-term official rural
credit in 1990 compared to 1987 are planned to be cut by 80 and 15?,
1/ In 1986 and 1987, the cost to the Government (calculated as the
difference between controlled interest rates and the yield on
Government Treasury bonds multiplied by the volume of official rural
credit supplied by the Government) is estimated to have been
approximately US$557 million and US$285 million, respectively. In 1986
these interest subsidies accounted for about 6? of the fiscal deficit.
Furthermore, there is a considerable cash flow loss resulting from the
fact that official credit resources channelled through the government-
owned banks are, for the most part, not being recovered by the
Treasury.



-6-
respectively. The program will be updated annually, with a view to
achieving deeper cuts, and is intended to become a three-year rolling plan.
As under the Fourth Agro-Industries Credit Project, assurance was obtained
at negotiations that the Economic Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance
(SEAE) would prepare and submit to the Bank quarterly reports on the 'tatus
of implementation of this program; and that the Government would meet with
the Bank each year to review and update the program.
2.10     To exercise tighter control over the availability of official
credit and to make such subsidies more transparent, the Government recently
transferred all responsibility for administering official credit lines to
the Treasury (STN), including those previously administered by the Central
Bank (CB). The newly established Credit Limit Committee (CLC), comprised
of a representative from the CB, STN and SEAE, now makes all credit
allocation decisions for official credit currently administered by STN. In
addition, all such Government expenditures will now be shown in the
Government's fiscal budget instead of the monetary budget as was the
practice.
D. Farm Credit Demand
2.11     The demand for investment farm credit will be influenced by a
number of factors including the general outlook for the rural economy, the
need for on-farm investment, and the cost of credit funds. Each are
discussed below.
2.12     Following the large investments made in 1986, when investor
confidence and other factors were favorable, rural investment fell sharply.
The consensus in the agricultural community today is that in most of the
next several years, investment is likely to be more attractive than it was
in 1987. With annual sales of agricultural products estimated at about
US$20 billion, investment on capital items is expected to be in the order
of about US$4 billion per year.
2.13     Trends in farm machinery sales also give an indication of the need
for on-farm investment. The Brazilian wheeled tractor fleet is quite old,
with half having been purchased before 1980. The level of purchases has
been quite low throughout the 1980s and is considered unlikely to fall
below the 1987 level, estimated at about 40,000 units and valued at about
US$600 million to which should be added another US$200 million for
associated equipment. Sales of other agricultural equipment reached about
US$400 million in the depressed years of 1982 and 1983 and rose to US$743
million in 1985 and US$1.5 billion in 1986. Combine harvesters, considered
by farmers to be profitable, acccunted for between US$200 and US$300
million per year. This trend is expected to continue. While total
equipment sales in general were depressed in 1987 (about US$1.5 billion),
sales in future years are expected to be at least at the 1987 level if
there is no improvement in the macroeconomic environment and could be
considerably higher if this situation improves as expected.
2.14     The price of credit is another important factor that needs to be
taken into account in determining the demand for investment farm credit,



-7-
patticularly for project credit funds. If project funds were lent today
under one refinancing option (para. 3.11(iii)), the Interest or discount
rate to the participating banks would be approximately 122 (para. 3.14), to
which must be added the market-determined spread of the participating
banks (say between 2 and 4X) to obtain the rate to final borzowers. While
the resulting rate (14 to 16Z) is well above the current official rate
(72), it is just about equal to open market blended rates -- i.e., the
wilghted average rate resulting from the blending of official and market
credit funds (para. 2.06). However, strictly speaking there is no
comparable market rate for investment credit at present since all voluntary
lending today is short term. Thus, the competitiveness of project funds
essentially depends on the availability of cheap official credit; hence,
the importance of the Government's program to contract official credit
(para. 2.09). The fact that official credit declined significantly in real
terms in 1987 (para. 2.07), and the Government's planned reductions will be
in relation to this relatively low base, is encouraging so far as the use
of the project's commercial credit funds is concerned.
2.15     It is anticipated that even if the macroeconomic situation does
not quickly improve, annual rural investment would be at least US$3 billion
over the next two to three years and could be substantially higher if the
Government's stabilization measures are successful. in this context, the
demand for farm investment credit should be in the order of at least US$1.5'
billion per annum. The size of the proposed Bank loan to support an
investment credit line for farmers has been dimensioned accordingly.
E. Experience with Bank Lending
2.16     To date, the Bank has made 47 loans totalling US$3,652 million for
agricultural and rural development in Brazil. These loans includet two
sector operations -- the Agricultural Credit and Export Loan for US$303
million, approved in October 1983, and the Credit and Marketing Reform Loan
for US$500 million, approved in June 1986; supplemental financing of US$31
million under the Special Action Program; three loans totaling US$504
million for agro-industries; three loans totaling US$112 million for
livestock; one loan for US$18 million for grain storage; two for US$100
million for agricultural research; two loans totaling US$255 for
agricultural extension and training; one loan for US$100 million for land
tenure improvement; one loan for US$49 million for forestry development;
and 32 loans totaling US$1,681 million for various settlement, irrigation
and rural development projects.
2.17     Although the Bank to date has not given Brazil a free-standing
loa, for farm credit, it has in rural development and other agricultural
projects included components to finance farm credit. Invariably these
credit funds have been earmarked for particular investment purposes (e.g.
irrigation) or a specific group of farmers at official (controlled.)
interest rates and terms. The proposed project would be the first free-
standing farm credit project for the Bank and, more significantly, it would
be designed on totally commercial (unsubsidized) terms.



-8-
III. THE PROJECT
A.  Origin and Rationale for Bank Involvemer
3.01     The project originated from the Bank/Government dialogue on rural
credit in Brazil. Following the Government's recent decision to shift
dependence from official to commercial credit in the agricultural sector
and to have the Bank assist in this process, the Bank and the Government
began in earnest to prepare the proposed project which was appraised in
December 1987.
3.02     The proposed operation is the first step towards implementing a
strategy to replace most subsidized farm credit with commercial lending,
while gradually limiting the former to specifically well targeted and
justified cases. Because of the politically sensitive nature of farm
credit, the Bank's involvement in this process can be particularly
beneficial in helping the Government maintain a constant policy course in
the face of continued pressures from interest groups.
3.03     It is envisaged that future Bank support for credit in the
agricultural sector would come through a single credit line.   While the
proposed project does discontinue the practice of earmarking credit for
particular farmers or investment purposes, and therefore moves
significantly in the direction of consolidating credit markets, it still
reserves the funds for farm investment. Another proposed operation (the
Fourth Agro-Industries Credit Project), having a similar design, provides a
line of credit to agro-industries. These two pro4ects, therefore,
constitute an interim step towards eventually providing a single credit
line for the agricultural sector. This interim step is needed at this
stage to consolidate and build up support for a commercial approach to farm
credit following a long historical legacy to the contrary. After the
proposed project is firmly on track and commercial credit begins to replace
official credit, the Bank is planning to merge all its support for
agricultural credit into a single credit line to support the Government's
objective of integrating credit markets in the agricultural sector.
B. Pro3ect Objectives
3.04     The main objectives of the project are to support productive on-
farm investments and to initiate the process of liberalizing farm credit.
There would be no recourse to Government counterpart funding or subsidies.
Unlike the administrative allocation of official rural credit to particular
crops, regions or groups of producers, the application of project funds
would be determined by market demand based on producers' estimates of
returns on investments. At the same time, the project would help to
relieve Government concerns about the availability of credit for
agriculture, and provide such credit on terms fully consi3tent with the
objectives of phasing out rural credit subsidies and, more generally,
liberalizing rural credit.



C. Summary Description
3.05     The design features of the proposed project are similar to those
adopted for the proposed Fourth Agro-Industries Credit Project, which, like
the proposed project, is also a credit line being made available to banks
on commercial terms. Under the project, bank loan funds would be used by
the Government to refinance subloans made by accredited participating banks
to farmers and farm contractors to finance the latter's investment and
associated working capital requirements. The terms on which the Treasury
(STN) of the Ministry of Finance would refinance these subloans have been
designed to enable the Government to recover from the participating banks
(PBs) the full cost of obtaining and administering the Bank loan. The
terms on whlich the PBs would lend to their customers would be a market
outcome and, therefore, based essentially on the PB's refinancing costs,
plus a spread as determined by the market.
D. Detailed Features
1. Accrediting Participating Banks
3.06     In general, there is a well developed banking system in Brazil
with extensive geographical coverage for the purposes of rural credit. To
ensure that only qualified banks participate under the project, PBs would
need to be accredited by the Central Bank (CB), based on their financial
soundness, the quality of management and relevant loan appraisal
capability. Because the PBs would essentially manage the project credit
line, with only an oversight function provided by Government (para 3.20),
the accreditation process would need to be rigorous in order to exclude
weak financial intermediaries. Assurance that the following accreditation
criteria would be applied by the CB was obtained during negotiations:
(i) the existing Operational Limits required by the CB, covering debt
to equity ratios, exposure to individual loans and foreign debt
borrowing and lending (agreement was obtained at nego_iations that
the Government would promptly notify the Bank of any change in the
Operational Limits);
(ii)   arrears as a percentage of the total outstanding loans would ;.ot
exceed 102, with arrears defined as eitheL principal or interest
which is overdue for six months or more, including those overdue
payments that have either been capitalized, refinanced or rolled
over into a new loan; and
(iii) the number and qualifications of staff for appraising and managing
agricultural subloans and, where appropriate, the PBs past record
in agricultural lending, would be judged satisfactory.
2. Eligibility and Approval for Refinancing
3.07     The types of investments which would be eligible for refinancing
under the project would include, for example, land clearing and
preparation, soil conservation measures, irrigation works and equipment,



-10-
the egtablishment of permanent and semi-permanent crops and breeding herds,
infrastructure, plant, machinery and equipment, including storage
facilities, tractors, trucks and combine harvesters. The working capital
requirements associated with the investments, up to 502 of the investment
costs financed by the Bank loan, would also be eligible for financing.
3.08     The subborrowers of the investment credit would be:
(a) agricultural producers; (b) cooye-a ives of agricultural producers; and
(c) firms providing contract services to agriculture with mechanized
equipment (for example, land clearing and harvesting). A single
subborrower would not be permitted to borrow in total more than 52 of the
Bank loan (i.e. not more than US$15.0 million). Assurances on all of the
above eligibility conditions were obtained at negotiations.
3.09     For subloans below prescribed free limits (US$1.0 million),
accredited PBs would have the sole right of approval. The PB would only
need to inform STN that the subloan has been made by submitting the
appropriate subloan documentation, and, at the appropriate time, submit a
request for disbursement of the credit funds. This would eliminate the
need for Government discretionary authority in approving subloans for
refinancing which is one of the main objectives of this operation, namely
to replace administrative allocation decisions with market interest rates
in determining the allocation of credit. However, for those few subloans
at or above the free limit, the PBs, through STN, would submit proposals to
the Bank for approval. In addition, STN would send to the Bank for its
review, the documents on the first four subloans made. Assurances that
these procedures would be followed were obtained during negotiations.
3.    Refinancing Terms
3.10     The refinancing terms are the terms under which the Government
would refinance PB subloans. These terms have been designed to enable the
Government to recover from the PBs the full costs, including foreign
exchange risks, of the Bank loan, plus the administrative costs to the
Government.
3.11     The treatment of foreign exchange risk is fairly straightforward
if the refinancing of PB subloans is denominated in the same form that the
Government borrows from the Bank (i.e., in the Bank's basket of pooled
currencies which it uses for disbursement purposes) in which case the
outstanding principal would be adjusted in accordance with changes in the
value of the Bank's basket of currencies. However, some PBs may be
unwilling to incur this cross-currency risk, and, therefore, may be
discouraged from borrowing. Generally PBs and the subborrowers to whom
they lend, are willing to accept risk only in a form in which they are
reasonably familiar (essentially a psychological factor) and against which
they believe they can hedge, with the larger and financially more
sophisticated borrowers normally having more opportunities in this regard.
Therefore, to make the refinancing product more marketable to the largest
number of prospective customers, while still meeting the requirement that
Government recover from the PBs to the extent practicable, the full cost of



-11-
the Bank loan, the risk has been converted into a few other forms (all with
the same approximate cost in present value terms over the average life of a
subloan) in order to give PBs a choice in denominating their refinancing
terms. These options would include:
(i)   in the Bank's basket of currencies, in which case the PB would
take the foreign exchange risk in exactly the same form that the
Government does, and the applicable interest rate would be the
six-month adjustable interest rate the Bank charges IBRD borrowers
(currently 7.72Z); or
(ii)   in USS, thus taking the Cz$-US$ exchange rate risk as compared to
the cross-currency risk in (i) above, in which case the interest
rate in (i) above would be adjusted either upward or downward to
compensate for the difference in foreign exchange risk between
these two options; the differential between the weighted average
market yield on Bank bonds denominated in the currencies of the
basket and the market yield of US$ Bank bonds (based on publicly
traded bonds with a remaining maturity of 5 to 10 years) would be
used to reflect the difference in risk and added to or subtracted
from the interest rate in (i) above; for the calculation of the
weighted average market yield on the basket, bonds denominated in
five currencies (the US dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen and the
Netherlands guilder) would be used, as these currencies comprise
over 9O0 of the Bank's currency pool; the proportions that these
currencies represent in this subset of the Bank's total pool would
be used to weight the respective yields (applying the above
methodology at today's yields results in approximately a 3
percentage point premium which would need to be added to the
basket interest rate); the frequency of interest rate adjustments
would be the same as in (i) above; and
(iii)   in cruzados, with the principal adjusted in accordance with the
National Treasury Bond (OTN) index,2 in which case the applicable
interest rate would be as in (ii) above, plus not less than 0.8
percentage points and not more than 2.5 percentage points,
depending on the difference by which depreciation of the cruzado
vis-a-vis the dollar exceeds changes in OTN over the preceding six
months; this adjustment is to offset the higher risk in option
(ii) 2iat dollar/cruzado exchange rate adjustments will exceed
inflation as reflected in the OTN index (historically, over the
medium- and long-term, exchange rate adjustments have exceeded the
rate of inflation by about 2X per annum on average).
3.12     In order to launch the proposed credit line in Brazil, the first
year of the project would be treated as a promotional period during which
the interest rate at which the Government would onlend funds to the PBs
would be somewhat lower than that prescribed by the above methodology.
Specifically, during the first year the premium to be added to the basket
2, The National Treasury Bond index is used for purpose of indexing
financial contracts to take account of inflation.



-12-
interest rate in order to obtain the dollar interest rate would be set at
1.5 percentage points. After the first year the methodology described in
para. 3.11(ii) above would be applied in full'
3.13     The other refinancing terms would includes
(i)   0.25 percentage points interest annually to cover the costs to the
Government of administering the Bank loan;
(ii)   0.25 percentage points interest annually to cover the average
costs of the commitment fee which the Government pays on the
undisbursed balance of the Bank loan; and
(iii)   grace and amortization periods which would be the same as those
adopted in the subloans, with a maximum term and grace period of
12 and 3 years, respectively.
3.14     If calculated today, based on the above terms, the interest rate
at which the Government would refinance (i.e., discount) PB subloans under
each of the three currency options (basket, dollar and OTN cruzado) would
be 8.2Z, 11.22 and 12?, respectively, with the dollar and cruzado interest
rates being discounted to 9.72 and 10.52, respectively, during the first
year promotional period (para. 3.12). At negotiations, assurance was
obtained that the refinancing terms referred to in paras. 3.11 through 3.13
would be followed. As previously mentioned (para. 3.05), the final
onlending terms to subborrowers are intended to recover the PB's cost of
borrowing funds and would be a market outcome based on the negotiations
between PBs and their customers.
4.   Transmission and Repayment of Credit Funds
3.15     The process of channelling credit funds to subborrowers and making
loan repayments would work as follows:
(i)   after contracts between suppliers and subborrowers are signed, the
latter would request the PB to pay the supplier or himself
directly;
(ii)   the PB would then request reimbursement from STN; to affect this
disbursement, STN would authorize the CB to credit the reserve
account of the PB and transfer funds from the Special Account
(para. 3.24) to the Government's account;
(iii)   when repayment of the subloan is due, the subbo-rower would pay
the PB which would take its spread and repay the Government (in
accordance with the refinancing terms, paras. 3.11-3.13); the
repayment would be affected by STN authorizing the CB to debit the
PB's reserve account and correspondingly credit the Government's
account.
3.16     Assurance wac obtained at negotiations that these internal
procedures for disbursing credit funds to PBs and for making loan
repayments would be followed.



-13-
E. Project Cost and Financing
3.17     Bank loan funds would be used by the Government to provide a
commercial credit line to PBs to refinance up to 50Z of the investment and
associated working capital costs of each subproject approved for
refinancing; the balance would be negotiated between the PB and the
subborrower and could involve various possible combinations of PB,
subborrower and other (financial intermediary) finance: hence, no
Government counterpart funds would be needed. Assurance that these
financing arrangements would be followed was obtained at negotiations. The
project cost and financing plan are given in Annex 3, Table 1 and
summarized below:
Table 1: Project Cost and Financing
US million           2
Total Cost of Investments                   600             100
Financed by:
Bank                                     300              50
PBs, other lending institutions
and subborrowers                         300              50
3.18     Because of the range and variety of investments eligible for
project financing, t4xe foreign exchange and tax components are impossible
to calculate with any degree of accuracy. It is, however, estimated that
the foreign exchange component is likely to be in the order of 1OZ-152 of
total costs (most machinery and equipment components are domestically
manufactured), and taxes to be about 5Z (tractors and agricultural
equipment are exempt from tax).
3.19     The borrower of the Bank loan would be the Government.  Although
the refinancing terms (paras. 3.10-3.13) have been designed to hav.  the
Government recover from the PBs the full costs of the Bank loan, there
could be some discrepancies between the Bank lending terms and the
refinancing terms with regard to the treatment of exchange risks (as PBs
have one of three options each with different cash flow characteristics),
commitment fees (as the method chosen is only an approximation of the cost
to the Borrower) and grace and amortization period (as these will conform
to the subloans). Implicit in this formulation is the fact that the
borrower (i.e., the Government) would account for any difference; however,
these discrepancies are expected to be small.
F. Coordination and Management
3.20     The arrangements for coordination and management would be
essentially the same as those adopted under the Fourth Agro-Industries
Credit Project. Being essentially a credit line, the main management
function would be performed by the PBs who would be responsible for
reviewing and approving subloans and monitoring investment and repayment



-14-
performance after the subloans are given. To ensure that the banks which
participate in the project are qualified, they would need to be accredited
by the CB according to agreed criteria before they c2mild become PBs
(para. 3.06).
3.21     The CB, on behalf of the Government, would manage the Special
Account (para. 3.24), including the crediting and debiting of PB reserve
accounts (para. 3.15(ii) and (iii)). Within the CB, this function would be
performed by the Department of International Organizations and Agreements
(DEORI). Information needed for the accreditation of PBs would be
maintained by the CB's Department of Banking (DEFIB) which would make this
information available to the CB's Department of Rural Credit (DEPUR),
which, based on the agreed criteria (para. 3.06), would be responsible for
actually accrediting PBs under the project. In addition, DEPUR would
coordinate all the activities to be performed by the different CB
departments under the project and would be responsible for communicating
directly with the PBs, including informing them every six months of changes
in the cost of refinancing (interest rates and outstanding principal) based
on the different refinancing options (para. 3.11).
3.22     Overall project coordination would be the responsibility of STN
which, in addition to authorizing the CB to credit and debit PB reserve
accounts, would: (i) monitor overall project performance and report
progress to the Bank (para. 3.23); (ii) answer general queries from present
and prospective PBs and subborrowers concerning refinancing eligibility,
accreditation, etc.; and (iii) generally remove bottlenecks and solve any
problems that may arise. The unit in STN recently set up to administer all
official credit lines (para. 2.10) and which also has the responsibility
for overseeing the Fourth Agro-Industries Credit Project, would, in
addition, carry out the above functions for the proposed project. During
negotiations, assurance was obtained that STN would carry out supervision
of the project in a manner satisfactory to the Bank with management and
staff adequate in numbers, qualifications and experience and utilizing
appropriate financial control systems.
G. Procurement
3.23     The range of goods to be financed under the project would be
varied. Vehicles and computers, being reserve procurement, would be
excluded from Bank financing. In the case of most subprojects, the items
to be financed under the project would not be suitable for bulk
procurement. Accordingly, procurement for most subprojects would be in
accordance with standard practice for loans of this type and would follow
the normal commercial practice of private sector enterprises -- the
beneficiaries of the proposed loan. Although the possibility of packaging
contracts large enough to attract foreign bidders is extremely unlikely;
nevertheless, to allow for this possibility, international competitive
bidding procedures would apply in the case of contracts of US$3 million or
more. Brazilian contractors and suppliers would receive a 152 preference
over foreign suppliers.  During negotiations assurance was obtained that
the above procurement procedLres would be followed.



-15-
H. Disbursements
3.24     To facilitate Bank disbursements, a Special Account would be
opened in US dollars in the CB and operated under the same general
procedures applicable to other special accounts in the CB. The Special
Account would be opened with a deposit of US$25 million. Similar accounts
have been established under a number of previous Bank loans in Brazil and
are working satisfactorily. The advances would be used to finance only the
Bank's share of the project costs. The proceeds of the proposed loan would
be disbursed to the PBs on the basis of 1002 of the amount disbursed for
subloans (which would be up to 501 of the total subproject costs) and would
be made against statements of expenditure (SOE). The documents in support
of these SOEs would be retained by the CB and made available for inspection
by the Bank during project supervision missions and would be subject to
annual independent audit (paras. 3.29 and 3.30). During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances on these disbursement matters. In addition,
receipt by the Bank of the signed refinancing agreement between the PB and
the Government and the approval of the Bank for subloans at or above the
free limit (para. 3.09), would be conditions of disbursement.
3.25     Consistent with the disbursement profile for free-standing credit
projects in Brazil, disbursements from the proposed Bank loan are estimated
to take place over a five-year project implementation period and would be
as followss
Table 2.  Disbursements
(US$ Million)
FY89       FY90        FY91       FY92        FY93

Cumulative       40          90         150        220         300
The estimated project completion date would be June 30, 1993.
I. Monitoring and Reporting
3.26     Monitoring and reporting on the overall program of financing would
be the responsibility of STN: the progress of individual subprojects wouli
be the responsibility of the PBs. Each month STN would submit to the Bank
a summary report based on information provided by the PBs setting forth for
each PB: (a) the total number and principal amounts outstanding of new
subloans; and (b) the total amount disbursed to and repaid by each PB
during the relevant month.
3.27     Each quarter, the PBs would submit to STN a summary of the
progress made in making subloans, including information by subloan
regarding the number and principal amounts outstanding, and the
disbursements to, and repayments made by subborrowers, classified by region
and state and, as appropriate, by type of activity (e.g., livestock) and
investments financed (e.g., storage facilities, irrigation, tractors). The
Treasury would submit a summary of these reports to the Bank. On
completion of the project, STN would prepare a completion report.



-16-
3.28     During negotiations, the Government provided assurances on the
monitoring and reporting arrangements described above.
J. Auditing
3.29     The CB, on behalf of the Government, would maintain the Special
Account which would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. After the audit and not later than six months after the close
of its fiscal year, STN would transmit to the Bank certified copies of
these audited accounts, together with a certified copy of the auditor's
report which would include a description of the audi* procedures followed.
3.30     The auditors would, during the course of their annual audits,
carry out such test checks as were, in their professional judgment,
required of the internal controls over project transactions and of the
implementation of these controls. The test checks would specifically
include the preparation of statements of expenditure supporting
disbursement requests from the PBs and would confirm that the expenditures
at the subborrower level have been made for the stated purpose. The
auditors would include in their long-form reports such comments or
observations as they judged necessary on project transactions.
3.31     During negotiations the Government provided assurance on the audit
arrangements described above.
K. Environmental Impact
3.32     One of the major factors contributing to the degradation of the
environment is the divergence between the private costs perceived by
individuals and enterprises and the total social costs, including those to
the environment, associated with investment decisions.  In Brazil, the
availability of highly subsidized credit has kept the private costs
associated with many investment decisions substantially below the social
costs, often contributing in part to the excessive exploitation of natural
resources.  This can be seen most graphically in the more ecologically
fragile parts of the country (e.g. Amazonas) where various incentive
schemes (tax shelters and cheap credit) have made otherwise unattractive
investments more promising and contributed to an unsustainable rate of
settlement. By helping to remove these credit subsidies in the
agricultural sector, the project is expected to contribute to greater
husbandry and efficiency in the use of the country's limited natural and
other resources.
3.33     The environmental impact of the specific subprojects financed
under this operation would be subject to evaluation by state-level
environmental authorities (SEPAs), which are responsible for the
enforcement of national and state environmental control legislation. The
National Environmental Agency (SEHA) provides technical backstopping to the
SEPAs. Full responsibility for such enforcement was decentralized to the
SEPAs only in 1986, and in most states, they do not have the staff nor the
technical capacity to fully assume responsibility for effective



-17-
environmental protection. Also, the legislative and regulatory frameworks
are deficient in many states. Nevertheless, in the larger and more
advanced states, where many subprojects are likely to be located, there is
adequate capacity -- all have well-staffed and technically competent SEPAs.
In addition, under the Sao Paulo Second Pollution Control Project, the Bank
is financing programs to strengthen the pollution control capacity of SEPAs
in states other than Sao Paulo. This reflects the Bank's strategy in
Brazil of concentrating its efforts on helping to build a Brazilian
institutional and legal capacity to deal with environmental problems.
Under the proposed operation, however, the Bank would itself be reviewing
and approving all larger investment proposals (subloans at or over
SUS1 million) and would be in a position to identify potential
environmental issues and assure that they are referred to the appropriate
authorities.
L. Financial and Economic Benefits
3.34     The project would, in conjunction with private sector funds, lead
to the investment of some US$600 million equivalent in productive real
assets in agriculture, a sector of crucial importance for employment,
exports and domestic food production. The facilities provided to farmers
would also play an important role (presently unfilled) in Brazil's
financial markets. For all practical purposes farmers' options are limited'
to short-term credit at annual market rates of 25-401 or more, and to
official credit, which because it is subsidized and administratively
rationed, is not always available when needed.
3.35     The prospective returns from the investments financed should
exceed the interest rates charged on subloans; these rates in turn would
cover the cost of Bank funds mobilized on international markets and the
free funds of PBs mobilized domestically. The project's impact on poverty
would be indirect, but beneficial, through employment generation.
3.36     The project would help to maintain and update the capital stock of
agricultural firms. In physical terms, the decline and increasing average
age of the national tractor fleet has long been a matter of concern. The
project would help to restore the fleet with up-to-date equipment and would
encourage the growth of the fleet of combine harvesters. Investments in
irrigation and other agricultural equipment would also modernize and
improve productive efficiency.
3.37     By its reliance on market forces and the private sector for the
identification of investment opportunities, the allocation of resources and
the provision of financing, the project would embody policy changes needed
to liberalize rural credit markets in Brazil. The project would use no
public funds, and would, by providing a now source of funds, reduce
pressure on the public sector deficit.
M. Risks
3.38     At present the demand for investment farm credit, as for most
investment credit, although positive and potentially high, is depressed due
to the uncertain political and economic environment.  However, the proposed



-18-
loan amount takes these factors into account and was dimensioned
accordingly. Furthermore, recent Government commitments to reducing the
fiscal deficit and the renewed dialogue with the IMF are encouraging
developments. Competition from official subsidized credit could also
reduce the demand for the project's commercial credit funds; however, the
Government is committed to reducing the supply of official credit to the
agricultural sector and has begun to implement a program to this end
(para. 2.09).  This program would be monitored regularly and updated and
reviewed annually with the Bank.
IV.  Summary of Agreements and Recommendations
4.01     During negotiations, assurances from Government were obtained
thats
(a) SEAE would prepare and submit to the Bank quarterly reports on the
status of implementation of the Government's program to contract
official credit to the agricultural sector, and the Government
would meet with the Bank on an annual basis to review and update
this program (para. 2.09);
(b) participating banks would be accredited by the CB according to the
criteria described in para. 3.06;
(c) refinancing of subloans would be confined to eligible types of
investment activity and associated working capital costs
(paras. 3.07 and 3.08);
(d) a single subborrower would not be able to borrow in total more
than 5Z of the Bank loan (para. 3.08);
(e) for subloans below the free limit of US$1 million, accredited PBs
would have the sole right of approval and for subloans at or
above the free limit, the PBs, through STN, would submit them to
the Bank for approval (para. 3.09);
(f) the refinancing terms described in paras. 3.11 through 3.13.
would be followed (para. 3.14);
(g) the internal procedures for disbursing the credit. funds to PBs and
for making loan repayment as described in pa:a. 5.15 would be
followed (para.3.16);
(h) the proceeds of the Bank loan would be used to refinance up to 50Z
of the investment and associated working capital costs of a
subproject (para. 3.17);
(i) STN would carry out supervision of the project, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, with management and staff adequate in
numbers, qualifications and experience and utilizing appropriate
financial control systems (para. 3.22);



-19-
(j) procurement arrangements outlined in para 3.23, including the use
of ICB in the case of contracts of US$3 million or more, would be
followed;
(k) suitable arrangements would be made for the establishment and
operation of a Special Account in the CB (para. 3.24);
(1) STN would prepare and submit to the Bank monthly (para. 3.26) and
quarterly (para. 3.27) progress reports (para. 3.28)s and
(m) the audit arrangements described in paras. 3.29 and 3.30 would be
followed (para. 3.31).
4.02     Receipt by the Bank of the signed refinancing agreement between
the PB and the Government and the approval of the Bank for subloans at or
above the free limit would be conditions of disbursement (para. 3.24).
4.03     With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent at the
standard variable rate, with a term of 15 years, including a 5-year grace
period.
