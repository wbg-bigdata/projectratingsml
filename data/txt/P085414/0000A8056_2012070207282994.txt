                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The final joint DFID/Bank supervision mission was undertaken in June 2012 to review project performance since the start of the project in 2007.

                         The main objectives of the mission were to: assess the overall progress towards the project development objectives since the beginning of the project in 2007, including (i) statistical

                         infrastructure, adoption of international standards and metadata, (ii) Upgrading of physical infrastructure, (iii) Data production, including administrative data and priority surveys, (iv)
                         Progress towards building a NSS, (v) Data dissemination, including survey reports and microdata, (vi) Institutional reform, transition from CBS to KNBS, (vii) Project management,
                         including procurement and FM, (viii) Disbursements and financial sustainability of the project, (ix) Future World Bank and DFID support to statistics in Kenya. In addition, the mission
                         discussed issues around closure of the project, including the possibility of a closing date extension, disbursement and direct payment arrangements.

                         General findings of the mission:

                         Overall, since approval of the project in 2007 there has been appreciable progress in data production, institutional reform, capacity and infrastructure development, both physical and
                         statistical, and in coordination of the national statistical system. There has been less than expected progress in the areas of data dissemination, including micro data access, and
                         project management.

                         Areas of considerable progress. With respect to institutional reform, KNBS has been transformed from a Government department, Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), to a semi-
                         autonomous agency; Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, and Government has completed the planned staff transition process, including assimilation of all Government staff that had
                         been seconded to KNBS. Thus, all staff are now employees of KNBS. The project has funded 13 out of the 15 surveys undertaken under the current KNB Strategic Plan
                         (2008-2012), including a number of important economic surveys that have significantly improved the compilation of the national accounts. The Government of Kenya funded the
                         majority of the 2009 Census costs, which generated results in one year – one of the best results for the production of census reports in Sub-Saharan Africa. Impressive progress has
                         also been registered across the national statistical system, both with respect to data production from administrative records kept by various line ministries, departments and agencies
                         (MDAs), and coordination of data producers across sectors. In MDAs, in general, there has been a marked increase in the quantity and quality of data produced, and support from the
                         project has helped to reduce the production time in some MDAs.

                         The data access challenge. Despite the progress in data production, there has been limited progress in user access to the data and other statistical information produced by most the
                         MDAs. The Censuses and surveys undertaken by KNBS are traditionally launched in hard copy with only headline statistics being made available in electronic (pdf) format online.
                         Access to anonymized micro data is limited and KNBS’ dissemination framework is therefore largely viewed as functioning poorly by data users. The only indicators that are regularly
                         updated on KNBS' website is the monthly CPI, the quarterly GDP aggregates, and some basic monthly economic indicators, such as coffee and tea prices. Most reports of the many
                         economic and social surveys completed over the decades are not available online,. In addition, for a large period of the project, KenInfo, the national database for development
                         results, which is housed in KNBS, has either been inaccessible to users or key indicators have been several years out of date. However, recently, the Mid-Term Priority indicators in
                         KenInfo have been updated to the year 2010.

                         Progress towards the defined Project Development Objectives. Of the eight Project Development Objective (PDO) outcome indicators, six out of seven reached their target. One
                         indicator (3-a, on the IDA14 indicators) appears to be incorrectly defined as individual countries were not expected to report annually on the IDA14 indicators.

                         Progress towards the GDDS targets. The first four targets on data production in accordance with the General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS) have all reached their targets, e.
                         g. the production time of the full range of national accounts has been reduced from 24 to 9 months, the production time for the balance of payment statistics has been reduced from
                         12 to 9 months, while government financial statistics and banking statistics are now more comprehensive and of improved quality compared to the project baselines.

                         Progress on the dissemination targets. For indicator 2-a, the role of the Statistical Abstract to present the main Mid-Term Priorities (2008-2012) development indicators has largely
                         been taken over by the Annual Progress Report, which is produced by the M&E Directorate in Ministry of Planning. The MED has produced three Annual Progress Reports (APR)
                         since 2009 that contain many indicators produced by KNBS. Whereas the production time of the APRs is still around nine months, which is about five months too long to effectively
                         influence budget formulation, in comparison to the Statistical Abstract that took two years to produce, the production time for the national indicators has been significantly reduced
                         and the target achieved. However, the time to upload the same indicators on the KNBS website (indicator 2-b) varies from 9 to longer than 12 months, and the target of availing
                         produced information on the MDGs and MTP indicators (the latter are contained in the APR) on KNBS' website within three months has not been achieved. The MDG/IDA 14
                         indicators (only those available annually) are contained in the annual APR and MDG reports, which is good progress compared to the baseline. Thus target 3-b has also been

                         Transition of project management unit. Broadly, KNBS has achieved notable progress in data production during the period of the project, but failed to progress substantially in making
                         that data available to users. The other major area where progress has been inadequate is project management. The project management unit was named the Transitional Support

                         Unit (TSU) to highlight that its role would be to temporarily manage the project while building capacity within KNBS, so that by the end of the project KNBS would have that capacity.
                         Additionally, the project has had persistent financial management and procurement problems which have not been resolved.

                         Continuing procurement challenges. The experience with the procurement of netbooks for the National Sample Survey and Evaluation Program (NASSEP) provides an informative
                         case study of the impact of procurement challenges. NASSEP provides the “sample frame? that KNBS plans to use to draws samples for a variety of surveys, including the next
                         Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS). The NASSEP “listing? exercise involves field visits to all the households in the sample frame to collect their basic information
                         and exact location. Completion of the NASSEP listing must be completed before fieldwork can begin for all other household surveys, including the KIHBS. During the last year, the
                         World Bank team worked closely with the KNBS team, providing extensive technical assistance over several months in preparing KNBS to conduct the NASSEP listing using netbook
                         computers rather than pen-and-paper. Data collection via computer has the advantage that it greatly speeds data processing time after fieldwork. Conducting the NASSEP exercise
                         using netbooks was intended as a key step towards modernizing KNBS’s survey work and collecting data for other surveys, such as the KIHBS using computers in the field.
                         Unfortunately, due to problems with procurement, KNBS was unable to purchase the netbooks. The KNBS tender committee ultimately did not approve the awarding of the contract.
                         After considerable effort had been spent on this initiative, this was frustrating to both the KNBS technical staff and the World Bank team. KNBS consequently had to abandon the
                         netbook plans and conduct the NASSEP exercise using paper-and-pencil. This resulted in further delays in the NASSEP plans, which in turn resulted in delays in other planned
                         surveys. Additionally, the delays means that NASSEP was not completed during the STATCAP project period, and it is unclear if funding will be available to complete the exercise
                         later.

                         Disbursements. As of early June 2012, the project has fully disbursed the £6.5m DFID grant, while $10.9m out of the $21.2m IDA credit has been disbursed, equivalent to 51.5% of
                         the total credit. Approximately, a further $3.0m has been committed and is expected to be disbursed shortly. This would increase the total disbursed amount to around $14m, or 66%
                         of the total credit amount. A short project extension of 2-3 months is foreseen to complete the transfer of the remaining project funds.

                         Sustainability. The STATCAP project intended to lay the foundations for future GoK support to statistics in Kenya. GoK was expected to gradually increase its budget allocations to
                         statistical services at KNBS and other key MDAs. However, there is insufficient information on the financial contribution of GoK to the current Strategic Plan, beside funding most of
                         the Census, to conclude whether GoK development funding for statistics has increased or not. There is particular reason for concern with respect to future funding for economic
                         statistics, as STATCAP has funded 13 out of 15 surveys in the current Strategic Implementation Plan . Current levels of Government funding are therefore unlikely to sustain the
                         KNBS current program in both economic and social statistics. The situation is made more acute as the Kenya Constitution makes provision for 47 county administrations, for which
                         authoritative statistics will be needed in each county for their functioning. Neither the World Bank nor DFID, the main financial supporters of the national statistical system in Kenya
                         among DPs, have committed any immediate financial commitments to follow-up on the STATCAP project, although there are prospects for securing funding for priority surveys such
                         as the next KIHBS II survey. The UN agencies provide additional resources for some statistical activities, including KenInfo, but their combined contribution remains relatively modest.
                         The financial sustainability of core government statistics, particularly the national accounts and county level statistics, is therefore uncertain.
