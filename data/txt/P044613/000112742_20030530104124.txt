The 
Transport 
System 
(for 
details 
see 
Annex 
11). 
The 
transport 
infrastructure 
in 
Ethiopia 
comprises a 
road 
network 
estimated 
(in 
2002) 
at 
33,000 
km 
(of 
which 
about 
16,000 
km 
are 
federal 
roads 
and 
17,000 
km 
regional 
roads); 
a 78 1 
km 
railway line from 
Addis 
Ababa 
to 
Djibouti 
(about 
709 
km 
within 
Ethiopia); 
a 
national 
merchant marine; and 
air 
transport 
facilities 
including 
two 
international 
airports, 
seven 
major 
domestic airports, 
and over 
30 other domestic 
runways 
and 
airstrips. 
Ethiopia 
is 
a 
land-locked 
country 
and almost 
98 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
export and 
import 
needs 
are 
presently 
served 
through 
the 
Djibouti 
port. 
Road 
Transport 
Infrastructure. 
Road 
transport 
is 
the 
dominant 
mode 
of 
transport and 
it 
plays 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
supporting 
the economic and 
social 
development. 
The 
roads, 
in 
general, 
carry 
about 
95 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
passenger 
and 
freight 
traffic 
and 
provide 
the 
only 
form 
of 
access 
to 
most 
rural 
communities. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
road 
transport, 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
has 
been 
generally 
poor: 
only 
about 
12 percent 
of 
the 
road network 
is 
paved 
and 
road 
density 
remains 
one 
of 
the 
lowest 
in 
Africa. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
investments 
made 
under 
RSDP 
I, 
the 
share 
of 
federal roads 
in 
good condition 
has 
improved 
from 
14 
percent 
in 
1995 
to 31 
percent 
in 
2002. 
The 
road 
density 
at 
30 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
in 
2002, 
although 
better 
than 
in 
1994 
(at 
21 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km), 
is 
still 
below 
the 
average 
of 
50 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
for 
Africa. 
The 
access 
to 
ports, markets 
and 
services 
is 
limited. 
It 
is 
estimated that about 
75 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
area 
of 
the 
country 
is 
more 
than 
half 
a 
day’s 
walk 
from 
all-weather 
roads. 
Responsibility 
for 
the 
road network 
is 
divided 
principally 
between 
(i) 
the 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority 
(ERA), 
with 
an 
executive 
Board 
oversight, 
for 
federal 
roads 
and 
road 
sector 
policy 
implementation 
and 
coordination 
under 
the 
overall 
guidance 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Infrastructure; and 
(ii) 
Regional 
Roads 
Authorities 
for 
the 
regional 
roads 
within 
their 
boundaries. 
Road 
Transport 
Services. 
The 
registered 
vehicle 
fleet 
is 
estimated at 
about  134,000 
(in 
2000), 
representing 
vehicle ownership 
of 
over 2 vehicles 
per 
1000 
population, 
which 
is 
low 
in 
comparison 
with 
other 
SSA 
countries 
and 
is 
inadequate 
for 
satisfying 
the 
overall 
transport 
needs 
of 
the 
country. 
Most 
of 
the 
vehicles 
imported 
into 
the 
country 
are 
used 
vehicles. 
Due 
to 
old 
age 
and 
long 
service 
life 
of 
the 
vehicles, 
there 
is 
a 
high 
incidence 
of 
breakdowns, 
relatively 
low 
operational 
availability 
and 
high 
vehicle 
operation 
cost. 
Some 
studies 
estimate 
that 
only 
about 70% 
of 
the 
fleet 
are 
operational 
at 
a 
time. 
Prior 
to 
1992, 
motorized 
transport 
services 
were 
highly 
regulated 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
tariffs 
and 
modes 
of 
operation, 
and 
as 
a 
result, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
vehicle 
fleet 
in 
the 
10 years 
before 
1992 
remained 
largely 
stagnant.  Since 
1992, 
the 
Government 
policy 
to 
de-regulate services, encourage 
market 
competition, 
and 
provide 
tax 
privileges 
for 
mass 
transport 
vehicles, 
has 
resulted 
in 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
fleet. 
Over 
the 
period 
1994 
to 
1999, 
vehicle-kilometers 
travelled 
increased, 
particularly, 
for 
heavy 
vehicles, 
which 
is 
higher 
than 
for 
small 
vehicles. 
This 
increase 
in 
total 
vehicle 
travel 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
an improvement 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
road 
network, 
increase 
in 
vehicle 
fleet 
and 
greater 
utilization 
of 
trucks and 
buses. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
have 
been 
signs 
of 
much 
more 
efficient 
adaptation 
of 
types 
of 
trucks 
to 
types 
of 
market, 
for 
example, 
along 
the 
import-export corridor. 
Vehicle 
ownership 
is 
concentrated 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
and a 
few 
other 
major 
urban 
centers, 
and the 
impact 
of 
low 
vehicle 
supply 
is 
felt 
more 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
The 
use 
of 
motorcycles 
is 
also 
limited 
with 
the 
motorcycle 
fleet 
estimated at a 
total 
of 
1172 
vehicles 
(RTA 
1997/98). 
Government and 
NGO 
staff 
mainly 
use 
these 
vehicles 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Bicycles 
and horse-carts 
are 
also 
mainly 
in 
use 
in 
and around 
urban 
areas 
and 
on 
bitumen 
roads. 
As 
a 
result, 
traditional 
modes 
of 
transport 
(including 
walking, 
head 
loading 
and 
animal 
transport) have 
continued 
to 
be 
of 
great 
importance 
for 
rural 
transport, 
while 
motor 
-3- 
Page  10
vehicles 
remain 
the 
predominant mode 
in 
Ethiopia 
for 
long 
distance 
freight 
and 
passenger 
movements. 
Pack 
animals, 
primarily 
donkeys 
and 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent 
mules, 
are 
by 
far 
the 
most 
predominant and 
important 
means 
of 
transport 
used 
by 
rural 
households.  Intermediate 
means 
of 
transport 
(IMTs) 
provide 
supporting 
services 
to 
the 
motorized 
fleet 
by 
linking 
remote 
rural 
villages 
to rural 
and 
urban 
markets, 
as 
well 
as 
passenger 
and 
freight 
transport 
within 
urban 
areas. 
Urban Transport 
and City 
Growth. 
Addis 
Ababa, 
with 
a 
population 
of 
about 
3.0 
million, 
is 
the 
capital 
city 
and 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
African 
Union 
and 
a 
number 
of 
international 
organizations. 
It 
is 
the 
only 
major 
city, 
the 
next 
largest 
urban 
center 
being 
Dire 
Dawa 
with 
a 
population 
of 
only 
250,000. 
The 
urban 
transport 
environment 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
is 
characterized 
by 
heavy congestion 
during 
peak 
periods, 
low 
vehicle 
utilization, 
weak application 
of 
traffic 
management 
measures, 
inadequate 
facilities 
for 
pedestrian 
and 
non-motorized 
transport 
(NMT) 
movement and 
poor 
road 
safety arrangements 
leading 
to 
high 
accidents. 
Public 
transport 
in 
the 
city 
consists 
of 
bus 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
publicly 
owned 
Anbessa 
City 
Bus 
Enterprise, 
mini 
buses 
operated 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
conventional 
taxis. 
A 
scoping 
study 
of 
urban 
transport 
issues 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Urban 
Mobility 
Component 
of 
the 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa 
Transport 
Policy 
Program 
(SSATP) 
in 
October 
2002. 
According 
to 
the 
study, 
the 
motor 
vehicle ownership 
is 
low 
at 
one 
automobile 
per 
44 
persons 
(compared 
with 
39, 
and 
50 
for Dar 
es 
Salaam 
and 
Nairobi, 
respectively). 
The 
modal 
split 
in 
the 
mid-90s 
was also 
estimated 
at 
pedestrian 
trips 
(70%), 
public 
transport 
(26%) 
and 
cars 
(4%). 
Inadequate 
public 
transport 
services 
have 
constrained 
participation 
of 
city 
residents, 
especially the 
poor, 
in 
economic activities, 
as 
well 
as 
limited 
their 
access 
to 
other 
services (health, education, 
market, 
etc). 
A 
ring 
road 
and 
associated 
road 
improvements 
are 
under 
implementation 
and 
these 
should 
help 
cross-city movement. 
Since 
1975, 
the 
population 
and 
physical 
size 
of 
the 
city 
has 
more than 
doubled. 
Addis 
Ababa 
is 
therefore a 
growing 
metropolis 
that 
needs 
a 
holistic 
approach 
to 
the 
planning 
and 
provision 
of 
its 
transport 
needs. 
Railways, 
Ports 
and 
Marine 
Transport. 
A 
single 
narrow 
gauge 
railway 
line 
runs 
over 
78 
1 
km 
from 
Addis 
Ababa 
to Djibouti. 
The 
Governments 
of 
Ethiopia 
and 
Djibouti 
are 
joint 
owners 
of 
the 
Chemin 
de 
Fer 
Djibouti-Ethiopian railway 
(CDE). 
At 
present, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
the 
CDE 
carries about 
700-800,000 passengers 
and 
200-250,000 
toneslyear 
(about 
2.6 
and 
3.75% 
of 
the 
total 
movement, 
respectively) 
. 
The 
share 
of 
CDE 
has 
been 
declining 
over 
the 
past 
decade 
principally 
due 
to 
its 
weak 
ownership 
and 
management structure, 
lack 
of 
commercial orientation 
and maintenance 
resources. 
The 
CDE 
Board 
of 
Directors 
and 
the 
two 
Governments 
(joint 
owners 
of 
CDE) 
have 
agreed 
to 
introduce 
important institutional 
changes 
including 
the transfer 
of 
operation 
and 
management 
of 
the 
railway to 
a 
private 
sector concessionaire. 
The 
reduced 
access 
to 
sea 
ports 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
conflict 
with 
Eritrea 
has 
led 
to 
the 
predominant 
use 
of 
the 
Djibouti 
port, and 
this 
has 
prompted 
Government 
to 
explore 
the 
use 
of 
other 
potential, 
but 
less 
used 
ports 
(including 
Berbera, 
Port 
Sudan 
and 
Mombasa). 
However, 
economic 
feasibility 
for 
the 
use 
of 
these 
ports 
needs 
to 
be 
firmly 
established 
with 
due 
consideration 
to 
the 
sources 
of 
supply 
and demand 
for 
import-export 
goods, 
potential 
high 
costs 
of 
transporting over 
long 
distances, 
associated 
transport 
regulations and security 
requirements. 
A 
national 
merchant marine, 
the 
Ethiopian 
Shipping 
Lines 
(ESL) 
with 
twelve 
ships 
and 
vessels 
of 
gross 
and 
net 
registered 
tonnage 
of 
over 
100,000 
and 
50,000, 
respectively, 
operate 
along 
routes 
to 
western 
Europe, 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
far 
east. 
Civil 
Aviation. 
Civil 
aviation 
plays 
a 
more significant 
role 
in 
the transport 
sector 
of 
Ethiopia 
than 
in 
most developing 
countries 
because 
of 
the 
limited 
road 
infrastructure, 
rugged 
terrain 
and 
relatively 
long 
distances 
between 
major 
settlements 
and 
long joumey 
times). 
The 
civil 
aviation 
sector 
has 
an 
extensive 
infrastructure 
with two 
international airports 
(Bole airport 
at 
Addis 
Ababa, 
and 
Dire 
Dawa),  seven 
major 
domestic airports, and 
over 
30 
other domestic 
airports 
and 
airstrips. 
The 
national airlines (Ethiopian 
Airlines), 
with 
a 
commercial 
fleet 
of 
about 
25 
carriers, 
provides regular 
scheduled domestic 
air 
services 
-4- 
Page  11
to 
32 
points, 
with 
the 
remainder 
being 
served 
by 
charter 
flights 
operated 
by 
private 
camers. 
There 
are 
five 
private national 
operators licensed, 
two 
of 
which 
have already 
started operations. 
Internationally, 
Ethiopian 
Airlines 
not only 
provides 
a 
service 
to/from 
Ethiopia, 
but 
has also 
developed a 
highly 
successful 
hub 
and 
spoke 
operation 
connecting 
49 
international 
destinations 
in 
Asia, Europe and 
the 
USA, 
and Eastern 
Africa 
with 
Southern and 
West 
Africa: 
about 
60 
- 
65 
percent 
of 
international 
passengers, 
handled 
at 
Bole 
airport 
are 
in 
transit 
for 
other 
destinations. 
From 
its 
international 
operations, 
Ethiopian 
Airlines 
generates 
significant 
foreign 
exchange earnings 
for 
the 
economy 
1.2 
The 
Government 
Program 
for 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
(with 
Donor 
Assistance). 
Recognizing 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
the 
road 
transport 
in 
supporting social and 
economic 
growth 
and 
meeting poverty alleviation 
objectives, 
GOE 
has 
given 
priority 
to 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
the 
road 
infrastructure. 
This 
priority 
is 
reflected 
in 
Government’s  Sustainable 
Development and Poverty 
Reduction Program 
(SDPRP) 
approved 
for 
implementation 
in 
2002. 
To 
address 
the 
constraints 
in 
the 
road 
sector 
related to 
restricted 
road 
network 
coverage and 
low 
standards, 
GOE 
formulated 
a 
10-year 
Road 
Sector 
Development Program 
(RSDP,  1997-2007). 
The 
first 
five-year 
phase 
of 
the 
program 
(RSDP 
I), 
1997-2002 
to 
the 
planned 
total 
of 
$2757 
million, 
was 
officially 
launched 
in 
September 
1997, 
and 
ended 
in 
June 
2002. 
Under 
RSDP 
I, 
Government 
and 
donor-funded projects have 
been 
implemented 
to 
rehabilitate 
the 
most 
essential 
core 
network. 
The 
World 
Bank, European 
Commission, 
African 
Development 
Bank, 
OPEC 
Fund, 
Bank 
of 
Arab 
for 
Economic 
Development 
in 
Africa, 
Nordic 
Development 
Fund, 
and 
the 
Governments 
of 
Japan, 
Germany, 
Italy, 
Ireland 
and 
U.K., 
have 
provided 
external 
financing 
to 
the 
Program 
to 
supplement 
the 
contribution 
from 
GOE. 
Of 
the planned 
expenditure 
under 
RSDP 
I, 
overall 
commitments 
by 
the 
mid-term 
review 
of 
the 
project 
was US$1607.4 
million 
in 
February 
2001. 
In 
the 
event, 
actual commitments 
with 
some 
activities 
extending beyond 
the 
period 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I, 
was  US$1,447 
million, 
of 
which US$ 
817.9 
million 
(57%) 
was disbursed.

provided 
in 
successive 
but 
overlapping 
road 
sector 
projects. 
As 
a start, 
the 
IDA 
Board 
approved 
the 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
Support 
Project 
(RSDPSP) 
on 
January 
15, 
1998. 
The 
Credit 
(Cr. 
3032-ET) 
for 
an 
amount 
of 
SDR 
224 
million 
(USS309.2 
million 
equivalent) 
was 
signed 
between 
the 
Government 
and 
IDA 
on 
January 25, 
1998 together 
with 
a 
Project 
Agreement 
signed 
between 
IDA 
and 
the 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority, 
for 
implementing 
the 
Project. 
The 
RSDPSP 
was 
the 
first 
of 
a phased 
participation 
in 
a 
Sector 
Investment 
Program 
(SIP) 
designed 
to 
implement 
the 
10-Year 
RSDP. 
The 
Credit 
proceeds 
for 
RSDPSP 
mainly 
supported: 
(i) 
rehabilitation 
and 
upgrading 
of 
four major 
roads 
(1380 
km); 
(ii) 
capacity

The 
RSDP 
Progress 
To-date. 
A 
week-long 
review 
of 
RSDP 
I 
progress was 
held 
during 
the 
mid-term 
review 
in 
February 
2001, 
which 
enabled 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
participating 
donors 
to 
take 
stock 
of 
the 
program-to-date, 
assimilate 
lessons 
learned 
and 
redirect efforts 
to 
a 
more efficient 
implementation 
of 
the 
program. 
A 
similar end 
program 
review 
was 
undertaken 
in 
July 
2002 
and 
March 
2003. 
Key 
points noted 
were 
the 
overall 
priority 
given 
to 
RSDP 
since 1997, enhanced 
familiarization 
of 
ERA 
staff to 
donors’ 
policies 
and 
different 
procurement 
guidelines and streamlined procedures 
and 
processes, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
ERA 
to 
effectively 
address 
the 
social 
aspects 
of 
transport. 
The 
achievements 
made 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
program 
are: 
Impact 
on 
Accessibility. 
The 
total 
classified 
road 
network 
has 
increased 
by 
about 
40 
percent 
over 
the 
last 
five 
years; 
much 
of 
the 
increase 
(107 
percent) 
has 
been 
in 
the 
regional 
roads. 
The 
road 
density 
has 
increased 
from 
21 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
in 
1994 
to 
30 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
in 
2002. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
80 
percent 
of 
farms that 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
more 
than 
half 
a day 
walk from 
an 
all-weather 
road 
in 
1996, 
have 
now 
been reduced 
to 
75 
percent. 
Impact 
on 
Quality. 
The 
efforts 
of 
RSDP 
I 
in 
improving 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
road network 
have 
not 
fully 
met 
expectations. 
This 
is 
mainly 
because 
of 
an 
unrealistic 
original 
schedule 
coupled 
with 
the 
slow 
initial 
implementation 
of 
civil 
works. 
Despite 
this, 
the 
improved 
maintenance 
efforts 
and the 
completion 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
main 
road 
sections 
have 
improved 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
federal 
road network 
from 
18 
percent 
in 
“good” 
condition 
in 
1995 
to 
30 percent 
in 
2002.

Impact 
on 
TrafJic 
Flow. 
Since 1992, 
a comprehensive 
traffic 
analysis 
has 
been 
made 
on 
the 
Ethiopian 
road 
network 
including 
most 
of 
the 
RSDP 
roads 
in 
order 
to 
see 
the 
overall 
trend 
of 
traffic 
movement. 
An 
assessment 
of 
traffic along 
main 
roads 
has 
revealed 
rapid 
increase 
in 
volume; 
traffic growth 
along most 
roads 
has 
increased 
well 
above forecast 
levels 
with 
the 
growth 
rates 
as 
high 
as 
12 
percent 
per 
annum.

Capacity. 
One 
of 
the 
goals 
of 
RSDP 
I 
was 
to 
develop 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
road 
sector 
at 
federal and 
regional 
levels. 
This 
goal 
was 
pursued 
from 
the 
start 
with 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
administration and 
management 
of 
the 
road 
sector 
so 
that 
Federal and 
Regional 
Road 
Organizations 
would 
have 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
current 
road 
asset 
and 
future 
investments 
in 
the 
roads 
are 
protected. 
Key 
areas 
of 
reform 
included: 
(a) 
improvements 
in 
contract 
administration, 
financial 
management, maintenance management 
systems 
and 
planning; 
(b) 
establishment 
of 
a 
road 
functional 
classification and 
pavement management 
system 
and a 
road 
inspectorate 
unit; 
(c) 
a gradual 
move 
away 
in 
ERA 
from 
own 
force “project 
work” 
(rehabilitation 
and 
periodic 
maintenance) 
to 
concentrate 
on 
the 
routine 
and 
recurrent 
works; 
periodic 
maintenance 
work 
is 
being 
contracted 
out, 
freeing 
up 
District 
Maintenance Organizations 
(DMOs) to 
focus 
on 
routine 
and 
recurrent 
works; 
(d) 
improvements 
in 
ERA’S 
procurement 
capacity 
as 
evidenced 
in 
capacity 
assessment 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
RSDP 
I 
implementation; 
(e) 
a 
number 
of 
background 
studies 
have 
been 
conducted, 
including 
those 
on: the 
restructuring 
of 
ERA 
and Regional 
Roads 
Authorities 
(RRAs), 
Village 
Level 
Travel 
and Transport, 
Pavement 
Management and 
Road 
Functional Classification 
System, 
axle 
load 
control, 
transport 
regulation, 
road

management 
and accounting 
system,

Regional Road Authorities 
(RRAs) 
have 
been 
restructured, 
changing 
from 
departments 
in 
the 
Regional 
Bureaus 
of 
Works 
and 
Urban 
Department, 
to 
autonomous 
Regional Road Authorities 
established 
by 
Regional 
Governments’ 
proclamations. 
An 
organizational 
structure 
of 
the 
Amhara Regional 
Rural 
Roads 
Authority 
has 
been 
used 
as 
a 
model 
for 
the 
establishment of 
RRAs 
in 
four 
regions (Tigray, 
Amhara, 
Oromia 
and 
Southern 
Regions). 
The 
other 
four 
regions’ 
organizational 
structures 
were 
developed 
based 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
a 
study 
of 
the 
Rural 
Roads 
Department 
of 
the Beneshangul 
and Gumuz Region.  The 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
study 
recommendations 
in 
terms 
of 
improved 
incentives 
and 
placement 
of 
staff 
is 
at 
different 
stages. 
A 
number 
of 
initiatives 
are 
under 
way 
by 
different 
donors 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
RRAs, 
especially 
with 
regards 
to 
planning 
and contract administration. 
Impact 
on 
Road 
Network Integration. 
ERA 
has 
carried 
out 
a 
study 
which 
has 
led 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
coherent 
network 
based approach 
to 
federal 
road 
planning 
and 
management 
in 
the 
country, 
based 
on 
three 
objective criteria: 
(a) 
need 
to 
be 
responsive 
to food 
security 
and 
poverty alleviation 
objectives; 
(b) 
need 
to 
improve internal connectivity 
within 
the 
country; and 
(c) 
need 
to 
strengthen 
key 
export-import 
corridors. 
The 
Regions 
are 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
preparing 
road 
network 
master plans 
which 
together 
with 
the 
federal 
plan 
will 
be integrated 
into 
a 
national 
road network 
plan. 
Impact 
on Sustainability 
of 
Financing 
for 
Road Maintenance. 
The 
Ethiopian 
Road 
Fund 
(RF) 
was 
established 
in 
1997 
with 
the 
objective 
to: 
(a) 
commercialize 
road 
management; 
(b) 
increase 
efficiency 
of 
resource 
allocation 
and 
use; 
and 
(c) 
finance 
road 
maintenance 
by 
designated 
road 
user 
charges. 
Over 
the 
period 
1997 
to 
2002, 
fuel 
levy 
(including 
dedicated 
sales 
tax 
and 
municipality 
tax) 
has 
increased 
from 
about 
US 
Cents 
2.0 
to 
4.5; 
as 
a 
result, 
during 
this 
period, 
annual 
RF 
collections 
increased 
from 
ETB 
160 
million 
(US$23 
million) 
to 
ETB 
260 
million 
(US32 
million).  Total 
annual expenditure 
on 
road 
maintenance 
has 
increased 
from 
about 
ETB 
60 
million 
in 
1994 
(prior 
to 
setting 
up 
the 
RF) 
to 
ETB 
212 
million 
in 
2002. 
The 
RF 
is 
able 
to 
address 
more than 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
federal 
road network 
maintenance 
needs; 
however, 
the 
maintenance 
of 
regional 
and 
urban 
road network 
falls 
far 
short 
of 
the 
planned 
target 
(only 
about 
25-30 
percent). 
The 
constraint 
to maintaining 
the 
regional 
road network 
is 
not 
so 
much 
a 
lack 
of 
financial 
resources 
but 
rather 
a 
lack 
of 
capacity 
in 
the 
construction 
industry 
and 
willingness 
of 
experienced 
engineers 
to 
work 
in 
distant regions. 
The 
Road 
Fund 
Administration 
(RFA) 
has 
improved 
its 
effectiveness 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
with 
a focus on: 
(i) 
establishing 
efficient 
-8- 
Page  15
commercial 
operations.  Performance contract 
agreements have 
been 
developed 
between 
the 
RFA 
and 
ERA, 
which 
has 
resulted 
in 
improved 
accountability 
and 
efficiency 
in 
resource 
use. 
No 
longer 
is 
payment 
made 
on 
a 
cash 
flow 
basis 
but 
on 
submission 
of 
payment certificates 
(based 
on 
agreed 
unit 
rates), 
approved 
by 
a 
supervisor; 
and 
(ii) 
maintaining 
effective 
public information 
systems 
and 
transparency 
through 
independent 
financial 
audits 
and 
dissemination 
of 
information.

Impact 
on 
Social 
Assessment 
and 
Environmental 
Impact 
Monitoring. 
One 
of 
the 
key 
environmental 
and 
social 
policy 
measures 
proposed 
in 
RSDP 
I 
was 
to mitigate 
adverse 
environmental and social impacts 
(including 
HIV/AIDS 
mitigation) 
in 
the 
various 
phases 
of 
the 
project 
cycle. 
To 
that 
end, 
an 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
Branch 
(EMB) 
was 
established 
under 
the 
Planning 
and Programming 
Division. 
The 
work 
of 
the 
EMB 
has 
gone 
beyond strictly 
monitoring 
the 
mitigation 
of 
environmental 
impacts 
in 
IDA 
financed 
projects, 
it 
has 
also assisted 
other 
donors. 
Progressively, 
the 
EMB 
has 
been 
engaged 
in: 
reviewing 
EA 
reports prepared 
by 
design 
and 
EA 
consultants; 
monitoring 
all 
IDA 
sub-project 
operations 
and 
providing 
support 
to 
other 
donor financed projects 
in 
the 
mitigation 
of 
adverse 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts. 
Also, 
the 
EMB 
has 
been 
responsible 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Procedures 
Manual 
and the 
ResettlemenVRehabiIitation 
Policy 
Framework. 
Furthermore, 
the 
EMB 
prepared 
an 
HIV/AIDS 
strategy 
framework 
for 
the 
road 
sector, 
which 
is 
under implementation 
to 
include 
not only 
ERA 
personnel 
but 
also 
their 
spouses 
and/or 
suppliers 
of 
sexual 
services. 
The 
strategic 
framework 
is 
being 
used 
in 
ERA'S 
project 
preparation 
and 
will 
be 
instrumental 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
RSDP 
11, 
with 
regards 
to 
environmental and social impact 
analysis and 
mitigation 
of 
adverse 
impacts 
including 
HIV/AIDS 
Impacts. 
Impact 
on 
Developing a 
Rural 
Road and 
Transport 
Policy 
and  Strategy. 
The 
GOE 
and 
IDA, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I 
and 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Rural 
Travel 
and Transport 
Program 
(RTTP) 
of 
the 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa 
Transport 
Policy 
Program 
(SSATP)  and 
participation 
of 
other donors and 
stakeholders, 
collaborated 
to 
develop a 
Rural 
Roads 
and Transport 
Policy 
and 
Strategy 
(RRTPS). 
The 
strategy addressed issues 
related 
to 
travel 
and transport 
needs 
of 
the 
rural 
communities 
(accounting 
for 
more 
than 
80 
% 
of 
the 
country's 
population), 
which 
have 
mostly 
no 
access 
to 
motorized 
transport. 
The 
RRTPS 
was accepted 
by 
GOE, 
and a 
10-year 
indicative 
program 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
Ethiopian 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport 
Program 
(ERTTP) 
prepared. 
The 
start 
up 
phase 
of 
this 
component 
was 
presented 
as 
part 
of 
Government's 
program 
document 
for 
RSDP 
II.

proposals 
for

The 
proposal 
was 
appraised 
jointly 
by 
Ireland 
Aid 
and 
DFID, 
and 
both 
have 
agreed 
to 
provide

Harmonization. 
Since

in 
1997, 
donor coordination 
has 
been 
implemented 
mainly 
at 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
ERA. 
ERA 
has 
worked 
with 
the 
Bank 
and donor 
partners 
to 
ensure 
harmonization rather than 
duplication 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas, 
including: 
(i) 
the 
development 
of 
its 
Roads

and 
in 
financing 
various

1.5 
The 
Government’s 
Proposed 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
Phase 
2. 
With 
the 
closing 
of 
RSDP 
I 
on 
June 
30,2002, 
the 
Government 
has 
prepared 
RSDP 
I1 
to 
be 
implemented 
over 
5 
years (2002-2007) 
with 
the 
objective 
to 
further 
develop management 
and 
technical 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
road 
network. 
If 
RSDP 
I 
phase 
could 
be 
categorized 
as 
a 
“network rehabilitation” 
phase, 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
phase 
can 
be 
categorized 
as 
a “development” 
phase, 
with 
the 
focus 
on 
scaling 
up 
the 
impact 
of 
activities 
under 
RSDP 
I. 
Under 
this 
“development” 
phase, 
the 
road 
sector 
is 
seen 
as 
needing 
to 
increase 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
social and 
poverty reduction 
objectives 
of 
the 
SDPRP, 
thereby, 
contributing 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs). 
In 
this 
regard, 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
existing 
limited 
paved 
trunk 
road 
network 
and 
provision 
of 
funds 
for 
minimum 
maintenance alone 
will 
not 
be 
sufficient. 
Therefore, 
under 
the 
RSDP 
11, 
the 
continuing 
investments 
in 
follow-on projects 
are 
required 
to 
ensure 
that 
agricultural production 
does 
not 
suffer 
from 
inaccessibility 
and 
high 
transportation 
costs, 
and 
include:

to, 
in 
particular, 
reduce 
the 
average distances 
of 
rural 
settlements 
to 
all 
weather 
roads 
to 
improve 
their 
access 
to 
markets, 
and social 
and economic 
facilities. 
The 
physical 
and 
performance 
targets 
expected 
to 
result 
from 
planned improvements 
to 
the 
road network 
are 
given 
in 
Tables 
4 
and 
5. 
In 
addition, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
further 
strengthen 
the 
management 
and 
financing 
of 
the 
roads 
sector, 
Government’s focus 
is 
on: 
creating 
a 
more commerciallv oriented 
ERA, 
through: 
(i) 
defining 
business 
objectives 
of 
the 
new 
organization; 
(ii) 
identifying 
ERA 
activities 
consistent 
with 
various 
stages 
of 
the 
devolution 
process; 
(iii) 
identifying 
managerial 
functions 
to 
be 
delegated; 
(iv) 
upgrading 
systems 
and 
procedures, 
including 
contract 
management, 
planning, procurement and administration; 
(v) 
improving 
head 
office 
support 
services 
to 
the 
District 
Maintenance 
Organizations 
(DMOs); 
separating 
client 
(ERA) 
and 
contractor 
(DMOs) 
roles 
at 
the 
ERA 
operational 
district 
level; 
by 
addressing 
the 
management 
and 
administration 
of 
maintenance activities, 
i.e., 
the “client” 
side 
of 
the 
new 
ERA 
district 
set 
up 
resulting 
from 
client/contractor 
split, 
with 
a focus 
on: 
(i) 
identifying 
principles 
for 
effective 
planning; 
(ii) 
the 
management 
of 
equipment; 
(iii) 
performance 
reporting 
and 
implementation; 
(iv) 
providing 
a 
basis 
for 
improved 
management 
performance 
at 
all 
levels; 
and 
(v) 
developing 
a 
competitive environment 
for 
undertaking 
maintenance 
work; 
and 
(vi) 
addressing 
the 
creation 
of 
commercially oriented 
units, 
delivering 
cost 
effective 
maintenance 
services, 
i.e., 
the 
“contractor” 
side 
of 
the 
client/

with 
a focus 
to: 
(a) 
reflecting 
true 
equipment

in 
carrying 
out

activities; 
(b) 
developing

parts; 
(c) 
management 
of 
costs; 
(d) 
identifying 
relationship between organizational

and 
individual 
performance; 
(e)

of 
domestic 
construction 
industry 
and 
increasing 
their

The 
focus 
is 
on

The 
IDA-Supported Program 
The 
IDA 
Support 
to 
RSDP 
II 
is 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
Adaptable 
Program 
Lending 
(APL) 
instrument, 
and 
the 
phasing 
has 
been 
developed 
for 
implementation 
in 
four 
stages 
(APL 
1 
-APL4). 
From 
the 
commencement 
of 
APL 
1, 
subsequent 
stages 
will 
overlap 
with 
the 
previous 
one 
over an 
overall program 
implementation 
period 
of 
10 
years (2003-2013). 
The 
proposed 
components 
and 
stages 
are 
listed 
below. 
It 
is 
understood 
that 
the 
final 
list 
of

to 
be 
considered 
under 
the 
APL3 
& 
4 
(See 
Annex

priority 
roads, 
will 
be 
subject 
to

program 
is 
on: 
(a) 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
key 
links 
to 
remove 
constraints 
to 
growth 
and 
access 
and 
expedite

of 
the 
vast 
natural 
resources, 
integrate 
the 
country, 
provide 
access 
to

The 
physical 
target 
is 
to 
have an 
improved 
road 
condition 
and 
also 
to 
install 
regular 
maintenance 
on 
much 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
road 
network. 
In 
addition, 
network 
density 
(Km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
Km) 
is 
expected 
to 
increase. 
Through 
this 
process 
the 
management 
of 
the 
sector 
will 
be 
strengthened, 
and 
an 
efficient 
and 
self-sustaining construction 
industry 
that 
is 
capable 
of 
meeting 
the diverse 
needs 
of 
the 
sector 
will 
be 
developed.

Document number: 
25591-ET 
The 
program 
which 
was started 
with 
IDA 
support 
under 
Cr. 3032-ET 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
Bank 
group 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
17009 dated 
August 
19, 
1997 and the 
Interim 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
No. 21 
189 dated 
November 9,2000. 
A 
primary 
objective 
of 
IDA’S 
assistance strategy 
to 
Ethiopia 
is 
to 
reduce 
poverty, through 
a 
medium-term 
strategy 
focused 
on 
private 
investment-led 
growth 
and export 
diversification. 
Lowering 
transport 
costs, 
and 
improving 
reliability 
of 
access 
to 
infrastructure, 
is 
assumed 
in 
the 
CAS 
as 
a 
key 
element 
to 
facilitate 
business 
development, 
especially 
domestic contractors 
and 
consultants, 
and 
to 
support 
poverty 
alleviation. 
These 
still 
remain valid. 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
February 4,2003 
The 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS), 
March 
24,2003, 
supports 
Ethiopia’s 
Sustainable 
Development 
and Poverty Reduction Program 
- 
and 
focuses 
on 
improving 
human 
development 
outcomes, 
enhancing 
pro-poor growth, 
and 
reducing 
vulnerability. 
The 
planned 
strategic 
assistance 
comprises a 
mixture 
of 
lending, 
and 
analytical 
instruments 
designed 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
evolving institutional 
structures 
of 
the 
country, 
and 
is 
focused 
on 
supporting capacity 
building 
within 
the 
public, 
and 
private 
sector, 
supporting 
policy 
reforms and 
investment 
financing, 
providing 
crucial capital 
investment 
funds 
for 
infrastructure 
development, 
while 
addressing fundamental 
policy 
issues 
through 
the 
analytical 
agenda.

The 
FY03-05 
CAS 
presents 
three 
lending 
scenarios, 
though 
currently 
on 
the 
base 
case, 
which 
includes 
namely 
grants 
owing 
to 
its 
status 
of 
debt-vulnerable 
low-income 
country. 
The 
marked 
deterioration 
of 
Ethiopia’s 
debt 
sustainability, 
largely 
due 
to 
exogenous 
shocks, 
presently 
precludes extension 
to 
the 
high 
case 
lending, 
until 
a 
decision 
can 
be 
taken 
at 
the 
Heavily 
Indebted 
Poor Countries (HIPC) 
Completion 
Point. 
Thus, 
this 
priority 
investment 
in 
the 
road 
sector 
in 
FY03 
is 
on 
a 
grant 
basis, 
which 
also 
set 
the 
limit 
for 
the 
APLl 
project 
scope. 
The 
CAS 
also 
seeks 
to 
build 
a 
free 
market 
economic 
system 
to 
enable 
the 
economy 
to 
develop 
rapidly, 
reduce 
food 
aid 
dependence 
and 
step 
up 
the 
pact 
towards 
achieving 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs). 
The project 
will 
support 
the 
pillars 
of 
Ethiopia’s 
SDPRP 
by: 
(a) 
enhancing 
pro-poor 
growth 
by 
supporting 
increased 
rural 
productivity 
with 
the 
provision 
of 
effective 
road 
infrastructure 
services 
in 
transport, 
stressing 
urban 
growth; and 
building 
labor 
augmenting 
sectors 
of 
the 
economy; 
(b) 
improving 
governance 
by 
supporting 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
systems 
and 
strengthening 
decentralization 
to 
shift 
decision 
making 
closer 
to 
the 
grass 
roots; and 
(c) 
reducing 
vulnerability 
by 
contributing to improved 
access 
between 
rural 
centers 
and 
markets 
and 
urban 
centers; 
and 
enhancing 
programs 
to 
prevent 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS. 
By 
design, 
the 
project 
will 
also 
provide 
increased 
opportunities 
for 
domestic 
contractor and 
private 
consultants 
participation 
in 
the 
program 
implementation. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
2.1 
Sector 
Issues 
The 
SDPRP 
and RSDPSP have 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
key 
issues: 
Quality 
and Quantity 
of 
the 
Road 
Network. 
The 
road 
network 
is 
limited 
in 
both 
quality 
and 
coverage. 
More 
than 
half 
of 
the 
road network 
in 
the 
country 
needs 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
or 
reconstructed, 
and 
most 
of 
the 
remaining 
network 
is 
either 
in, 
or 
rapidly 
falling 
into, 
a 
state 
in 
which 
routine 
and 
periodic 
maintenance 
may 
soon 
be 
insufficient. 
Much 
of 
the 
country 
does 
not 
have 
access 
to 
all-weather 
roads. 
Estimates show 
that 
only 
30 
percent 
of 
Ethiopia’s 
area 
is 
served 
by 
the 
modem 
road 
transport 
system. 
Moreover, 
because 
the 
existing 
pattern 
of 
roads 
radiates 
from 
the 
capital, 
Addis 
Ababa, 
to 
major 
towns, 
adjacent 
regions 
often 
lack 
links 
between 
them. 
Such 
inter-regional 
roads, 
if 
they 
existed, 
would 
facilitate 
the 
growth 
of 
trade 
between regions and promote 
national 
unity. 
Project planning 
has 
been 
limited 
to 
the 
application 
of 
selection 
criteria to 
individual 
roads 
or 
groups 
of 
roads; 
there 
has 
been 
inadequate 
network planning and programming 
procedures. 
Institutional 
Reform 
and 
Commercialization 
of 
ERA 
operation. 
ERA’S 
capacity 
was enhanced 
through 
TA 
support and 
training 
during 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
planning, procurement 
and 
network 
management. 
However, 
with 
intensification 
of 
the 
work 
program 
as 
proposed 
under 
RSDP 
11, 
much 
more 
needs 
to 
be 
done 
to 
strengthen 
the 
critical 
areas 
of 
review 
and approval 
of 
road 
designs, 
internal 
regulations, 
project monitoring, 
evaluation 
and 
technical reporting. 
Key 
issues 
identified 
include: 
(a) 
the 
Contract 
Administration Division, 
set 
up 
under 
RSDP 
I, 
is 
understaffed and 
lacks 
efficient 
organizational 
structure 
to 
manage 
the 
expected 
increase 
in 
the 
roads 
program; 
(b) 
limited 
experience 
in 
dealing 
with 
complex 
technical, 
legal 
and 
commercial 
issues 
in 
international 
procurement 
and administration 
of 
services 
and 
works 
contracts; 
and 
(c) 
ERA 
is 
a 
large organization 
responsible 
for 
constructing 
and 
maintaining 
the 
strategic 
federal 
road 
network. 
It 
has 
over 
10,000 employees, 
of 
which 
about 
7,000 
are 
in 
DMOs. 
With 
such 
a 
large 
and 
geographically 
spread 
organization, 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
delivery 
of 
services 
is 
compromised. 
Regional 
Road 
Authorities 
(RRAs). 
The responsibility 
for 
construction and 
maintenance 
of 
regional 
road 
network 
has 
been 
handed 
over 
from 
the 
ERA 
to 
RRAs 
since 
February 
1993. 
However, 
the 
equipment 
-17- 
Page  24
and workshop 
facilities 
handed 
over 
to 
RRAs 
were 
not sufficient 
to 
carry 
out 
road 
maintenance/ 
construction. 
In 
addition, 
the 
formation 
of 
efficient 
RRAs 
requires 
a 
well-trained 
manpower. 
During 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I, 
a 
number 
of 
initiatives 
were 
undertaken 
by 
different 
donors 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
RRAs 
especially 
with 
regard 
to planning 
and contract 
administration. 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
further 
strengthen 
the 
role 
of 
RRAs 
to 
more 
effectively 
plan, 
program, 
mobilize 
and 
administer finance 
and 
other resources 
for 
the 
construction, 
rehabilitation 
and maintenance 
of 
regional 
roads. 
They 
also 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
in 
their 
ability to 
discharge 
their 
responsibilities 
with 
regard 
to rural 
transport. 
Adequacy 
of 
road 
maintenance 
andfinancing 
arrangements. 
The 
Road 
Fund 
(RF) 
has 
contributed 
to 
providing 
resources 
for 
road 
maintenance. 
Total 
RF 
allocations 
(including 
supplementary budget) 
over 
the 
past 
six 
years 
(July 
1997 
to 
December 
2002) 
were 
ETB 
1.3 
billion, 
of 
which 
ETB 
887 
million 
have 
been 
disbursed 
to 
road 
agencies. 
The 
direct 
Government 
contribution 
for 
road 
maintenance 
has 
gradually 
declined 
from 
ETB 
68 
million 
in 
FY98 
to 
ETB 
10.7 
million 
in 
FYOO. 
The contributions 
to 
the 
Road 
Fund 
have increased 
gradually 
over 
the 
past 
three 
years 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
dedicated 
fuel 
levy 
and 
sales 
and 
municipality 
tax. 
During 
FYOl 
, 
total 
collections 
from 
fuel 
levy 
have increased 
(as 
observed 
in 
Section 
A 
1.4) 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
increase 
in 
dedicated 
sales 
tax 
for 
petrol 
from 
0.249 
1 
Birr 
(prior 
to 
September 
2000) 
to 
0.3606 
and 
for 
diesel 
from 
0.1662 
Birr 
to 
0.1917. 
The 
RFA 
now 
appears 
to 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
its 
mandate 
to 
address 
routine 
maintenance 
financing 
needs 
of 
the 
road 
network 
and 
improving 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources. 
However, 
while 
routine 
maintenance 
needs 
of 
the 
federal 
road 
network 
are 
being 
met, 
the 
requirements 
of 
regional 
road network 
as 
well 
as 
periodic 
maintenance 
needs 
have 
not 
been 
addressed adequately. 
The 
economic 
justification 
of 
applying 
extensive 
low 
cost 
regravelling 
under 
routine 
maintenance has 
also 
not 
been 
clearly 
established. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
huge 
backlog, and 
efforts 
by 
the 
executing 
agencies 
to 
keep 
the 
network 
in 
a 
passable 
condition, 
a 
planned 
and 
closely 
monitored 
maintenance 
regime 
needs 
to 
be 
applied. 
Absence 
of 
linkages 
between 
the pavement 
management 
system, 
the 
maintenance 
management 
system 
and 
the 
road condition 
surveys 
has made 
it 
difficult 
to 
establish the 
overall 
maintenance 
needs 
of 
the 
current 
network. 
Of 
critical 
importance 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
to maintain 
roads 
in 
a 
passable 
condition 
especially 
with 
further 
improvement 
and 
possible 
expansion 
of 
the 
network 
during 
RSDP 
11. 
The 
needs 
could 
rise 
to 
a substantial 
cost 
to 
the 
economy 
and 
make 
the 
current dedicated 
maintenance 
resources 
insufficient 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
Hence, 
mechanisms 
to 
meet 
the 
shortfalls 
would 
need 
to 
be 
identified 
to 
ensure 
sustainability 
of 
road 
maintenance, 
including 
a 
need 
to 
diversify 
the 
sources 
of 
funding 
for 
the 
Road 
Fund. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Road 
Fund 
Administration 
is 
expected 
to finalize 
arrangements 
and 
carry 
out 
maintenance performance audits 
to 
ensure 
prompt 
and 
appropriate 
maintenance and 
make 
the 
best 
use 
of 
maintenance 
resources 
within 
the 
targets 
set 
under 
the 
ERA 
Maintenance 
Action 
Plan 
(2002-2007). 
Domestic 
Construction 
Industry 
(DCI). 
One 
of 
the 
stated 
objectives 
of 
the 
1997 
Government 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Policy 
was 
to 
strengthen 
the 
private 
contracting 
industry, 
including 
enhancing 
the 
capacity 
of 
local 
contractors 
and 
consultants. 
The 
objective 
was 
to gradually 
increase 
the 
share 
of 
contractor 
executed 
works 
from 
11 
percent 
in 
1998/99 
to 
41 
percent 
in 
2001. 
Achievements 
to-date 
fall 
short 
of 
the 
targets agreed 
in 
the 
Letter, 
mainly 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
capacity 
in 
the 
local 
industry 
as 
well 
as 
access 
to 
finance. 
The 
DCI 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
characterized 
by 
an 
inadequate 
capital 
base, 
old, 
limited 
and 
poorly 
managed 
equipment 
fleets; 
and deficiencies 
in 
technical, managerial, 
financial, and 
entrepreneurial 
skills, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
previous 
policies 
that 
were 
not 
favorable 
to 
its 
development. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
firms 
engaged 
in 
road 
works, 
prior 
to 
the 
1980, 
were 
either 
nationalized 
or 
forced 
to 
withdraw 
from 
the 
road 
sector 
and 
this 
has 
resulted 
in 
the 
lack 
of 
capability 
and 
competitiveness 
in 
the 
sector. 
Some 
reform 
measures 
were 
embraced 
under 
RSDP 
I 
to 
change 
this 
scenario 
and 
build 
local 
capacity 
and increase 
involvement 
in 
the 
various 
aspects 
of 
the 
program. 
ERA 
and 
RRAs 
have 
also 
contracted out 
works to 
the 
DCI 
along 
with 
changing 
some 
conditions 
of 
contract 
in 
Govemment 
financed 
projects, 
to 
create an 
- 
18- 
Page  25
enabling 
environment. 
The 
immediate 
requirement 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
DCI 
and 
increase 
their 
participation 
in 
road 
work 
contracts. 
Equipment 
Constraints: 
The 
shortage 
of 
equipment 
and 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
its 
supporting 
arrangements 
have 
been 
recognized 
as 
major 
constraints 
to 
effective 
road 
maintenance. 
The 
shortage 
results 
from 
inheriting 
equipment 
without 
a stock 
of 
spares 
and 
with 
a 
limited 
ability 
to 
both 
maintain what 
exists 
and 
procure 
replacements. 
As 
a result, 
much 
of 
the 
equipment 
is 
not 
suited 
to 
maintenance 
tasks, 
the 
general 
age 
profile 
is 
high 
and 
the 
equipment 
maintenance 
load 
becomes 
progressively 
more 
difficult to 
meet 
with 
a consistent 
decline 
in 
equipment 
availability. 
The 
ERA 
objective 
of 
devolution, decentralization 
and 
commercialization 
can 
only 
be 
effectively 
met 
when 
issues 
related 
to 
purchase, 
preventive 
maintenance, 
acquisition 
of 
spare 
parts, 
routine 
maintenance, 
major 
component 
overhaul have 
been 
resolved. 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport: 
The 
Village 
Level 
Travel 
and 
Transport Study 
(VLTTS) 
shows 
that 
domestic transport 
in 
and 
around the 
village 
account 
for 
more than 
70% 
of 
the 
trips, 
about 
60% 
of 
the 
travel 
time 
and 
93% 
of 
the 
transport 
effort 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
The 
two 
most important 
components 
of 
travel 
and 
transport 
in 
rural 
areas 
are 
collecting 
water 
and 
fuel, 
which 
together account 
for 
about 
90% 
of 
domestic 
travel 
and transport 
time 
and 
effort. 
These 
trips 
are 
relatively 
short, 
frequent 
but 
time 
consuming and 
energy sapping. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
rural 
people, and especially 
women, waste 
much 
time 
in 
fulfilling 
their 
basic 
needs 
instead 
of 
participating 
in 
productive 
activities. 
The 
key 
issues 
identified 
in 
RRTPS 
are: (a) 
absence 
of 
sound organizational 
structures 
to 
cater 
for 
the 
characteristics 
and 
levels 
of 
travel 
and 
transport requirements 
at 
the 
household and 
community 
levels; 
(b) 
absence 
of 
planning 
and 
programming 
methodologies 
to 
consider the 
nature and 
size 
of 
transport demand 
in 
improving 
access 
to 
economic 
and social 
services 
at 
the 
local 
level; 
(c) 
lack 
of 
coordination 
and 
popular 
participation 
in 
the 
identification 
and 
prioritization 
of 
rural 
roads; 
(d) 
lack 
of 
correspondence 
between 
design 
standards 
and 
travel 
and 
transport demand requirements; 
(e) 
shortcomings 
in 
the 
expansion 
of 
labor-based 
technology 
in 
the 
context 
of 
generating 
employment 
opportunity 
and 
promoting 
effective 
utilization 
of 
local 
resources 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
government’s 
overall 
strategy. 
Need 
to 
focus  on 
social 
aspects 
of 
transport 
and 
the 
broader 
development 
related 
issues. 
The 
focus 
in 
the past 
has 
been 
on 
road 
network 
expansion, 
rehabilitation 
and 
maintenance. 
The 
performance 
was 
measured 
by 
reduction 
in 
road 
roughness 
index, 
quality 
of 
roads, 
vehicle operating 
costs, 
length 
of 
roads 
constructed, 
etc. 
However, 
with 
a 
renewed 
focus 
on 
sustainability 
of 
investments, 
poverty 
alleviation, 
gender 
equality, 
participation 
and 
inclusion, social and environmental 
mitigation, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
design 
interventions 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
is 
improved 
and 
sustained 
for 
all 
the 
population 
in 
the 
project 
areas. 
This 
requires 
monitoring 
and evaluating 
the 
impact 
of 
road 
investments 
(in 
addition to 
improving 
the 
engineering 
standards) 
on 
improving 
access 
to 
all, increasing employment 
(with 
a special 
focus 
on 
female 
labor 
force), 
increasing capacity 
of 
domestic 
contractors, 
improving 
safety 
standards, 
and 
mitigating 
HIV/AIDS 
impact. 
There 
is 
also 
the 
need 
to 
address 
travel 
and 
transport 
needs 
at 
the 
village 
level 
as 
well 
as 
on 
the 
federal 
road 
network. 
The 
need 
to 
include environmental 
impact 
considerations 
during 
the 
planning 
and 
implementation 
phase 
of 
road 
works 
has also 
become a 
pressing 
issue. 
Of 
particular 
focus 
is 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
sector 
in 
terms 
of 
financial, 
institutional, 
environmental, 
operational and 
regulatory 
aspects.

2.2 
Government 
Strategy 
The Government 
has 
prepared 
RSDP 
11 
document 
including 
lessons 
learned 
from 
RSDP 
I, 
policies, 
proposed actions and 
scheduled 
which 
was 
presented 
to national 
and 
external 
stakeholders 
on 
March 
14, 
2003. 
The 
program 
document and 
other 
supporting 
documents, viz., 
Policy 
and Capacity 
Building 
of 
the 
Road 
Sector 
, 
December 
2002; 
and 
Maintenance 
Action 
Plan 
(2002 
- 
2007), 
February 
2003, 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Policy 
dated 
May 
6,2003, 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
(see 
Annex 
12). 
Key 
areas 
for 
strengthening 
the 
reform 
program 
and 
investment 
allocation priorities 
have 
been 
identified, 
including: 
Set 
up 
a 
more 
commercially oriented 
ERA 
organization, 
with 
a focus to: 
(a) 
build 
capacity 
in 
ERA 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
contract 
management, 
design 
reviews 
and 
monitoring; 
(b) 
contract 
out 
internal 
functions, 
such 
as 
procurement; 
(c) 
separate 
client 
and contractor 
roles 
at 
district 
level; 
(d) 
gradually 
open 
the 
competitive 
field 
to 
the 
district 
contractor; 
(e) 
introduce 
long-term 
performance based contracts 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis; 
(0 
improve 
balance 
between professional 
and 
administrative 
staff; 
and 
(g) 
introduce 
performance 
indicators, 
measures 
and 
targets 
for 
main 
business 
units. 
To 
satisfy 
these 
objectives, a 
long 
term 
needs 
assessment 
of 
ERA 
will 
be 
conducted 
identifying 
specific functions 
to 
be 
retained 
by 
it 
after 
commercialization 
of 
the 
DMO 
and 
other nonessential functions. 
Commercialization 
and 
decentralization 
of 
DMOs. 
Improve productivity 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
cost 
and 
profit 
centers, 
commercialization and 
decentralization. 
With 
DFID 
support, 
a 
District 
Management 
Organization Capacity 
Building 
Project 
has 
been 
started 
with 
the 
objective 
to 
decentralize maintenance 
activities 
at 
the 
district 
level 
by 
separating 
“client”  functions 
from 
“contractor” 
functions. 
The 
DMOs 
are 
expected 
to 
be gradually transformed 
from 
efficient 
cost 
centers 
to 
profit 
centers 
and 
finally 
as 
full 
commercial 
entities. 
Strengthen 
the capacity 
of 
the 
RRAs 
and 
weredas 
for 
decentralized 
delivery 
of 
improvements 
to 
rural 
travel 
and 
transport 
by 
facilitating 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
ERTTP. 
A 
key 
aspect 
of 
the 
implementation 
mechanism 
is 
that 
it 
firmly 
puts 
the 
weredas 
and 
communities 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
decision 
making 
on 
needed 
intervention through 
the 
participatory 
approach 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
WTTP 
and 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
implementation 
structures 
at the wereda 
and 
village 
levels. 
Improvements 
to 
the 
rural 
transport 
services 
will 
include 
expanded 
use 
of 
IMTs, 
provision 
of 
appropriate 
rural 
transport 
infrastructure, 
location 
of 
facilities 
and 
use 
of 
labor 
based 
technology 
in 
road 
construction and 
maintenance. 
Increasing 
Local 
Private 
Contractors 
Participation 
in 
Road 
Contracts. 
There 
is 
a 
recognition 
by 
the 
Government that sustainability 
of 
the 
road 
sector 
reform 
program 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
domestic 
construction 
industry. 
Since 
1991, 
various 
measures 
have 
been taken 
to 
encourage 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
road 
construction 
industry, 
which 
had 
stagnated 
during 
1970s 
and 
1980s. 
Under 
RSDP 
11, 
further 
measures are 
being 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
the 
private 
construction 
sector, 
including: 
first, 
enhancing the development 
of 
different 
classes 
of 
local 
contractors and 
consultants 
by 
training 
and 
involving 
them 
more 
in 
major road 
works 
contracts, 
reforming 
contract 
documents, 
and 
implementing 
contractual 
requirements 
that facilitatelguarantee 
access 
to 
local 
Banks’ 
financing 
support 
for 
advance 
payment 
guarantees, 
performance and 
bid 
bonds, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
meeting 
capital 
requirements 
through 
easing 
collateral 
requirements, 
and 
facilitating 
establishment 
of 
equipment 
leasing 
companies. 
The 
second 
objective 
is 
to 
progressively 
increase 
the 
amount 
of 
regular maintenance 
activities 
let to 
private 
contractors. 
In 
addition, 
with 
the objective 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
maintenance 
works and introduce 
commercialization 
concepts 
in 
the 
operations 
of 
direct labor 
projects, 
ERA 
has 
prepared a 
new 
manual 
for 
administration 
of 
works, 
entitled 
“Standard Procedures 
and 
Technical 
Specification 
for 
Maintenance Works”. 
It 
is 
also 
proposed 
to 
introduce 
length-person 
system 
for 
maintenance 
work 
on 
selected sections 
in 
various 
ERA 
districts 
under 
a performance 
agreement 
to 
promote decentralization 
of 
works 
and 
improve 
effectiveness 
in 
maintenance 
of 
the 
road 
network.

Strengthen 
the 
domestic 
construction 
industry. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Capacity 
Building 
has 
established a 
Construction 
Sector 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
(to 
be 
implemented 
in 
collaboration 
with 
ERA, 
etc.) 
under 
which 
the 
following 
initiatives 
have 
either 
been 
planned, 
in 
progress, 
or 
completed: 
(a) 
a 
human 
resource 
program to 
enhance 
construction 
skills, 
e.g., 
operators 
at 
Alemgena 
training 
and 
strengthen 
construction 
industry 
associations; 
(b) 
amend 
the 
licensing 
system 
for 
contractors 
and 
consultants, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
bid 
documents; 
adopting 
and adapting 
industry 
standards; 
drafting 
the 
Building 
Code, and 
setting 
up 
standard 
laboratories; 
(c) 
established the 
Office for 
Licensing 
and 
Equipment 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Infrastructure; 
(d) 
provide training 
to 
trainers, 
comprising 
57 
technical 
teachers 
from 
9 
existing 
vocational 
training 
centers, 
and 
50 
construction 
foremen, 
for 
skilled 
labor 
in 
roadwork, 
concrete, 
reinforcements 
and 
formworks, 
masonry, 
ceramics, 
plastering 
and electricity. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
formed 
a Steering 
Committee 
(DCI 
Development Board) 
with 
members 
from 
the 
public 
and 
the 
private 
sectors 
to 
follow-up 
implementation 
of 
the 
DCI 
development 
program. 
Strengthen 
Resource 
Mobilization 
and 
Road 
Financing. 
Further 
measures 
will 
be 
undertaken 
under 
RSDP 
I1 
to 
widen 
the 
financial 
base 
of 
the 
Road 
Fund 
(RF) 
and 
enhance 
community participation 
in 
road 
construction 
and 
maintenance. 
The efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
RF 
resources 
will 
also 
be 
strengthened 
by 
conducting 
independent 
technical 
and 
financial 
audits. 
Maintenance 
Action Plan. 
The 
Maintenance 
Action 
Plan 
will 
be 
updated 
to 
reflect provisions 
made 
to 
protect 
the 
length 
of 
the 
road network 
already 
in 
a 
maintainable 
condition 
(good 
or 
fair) 
and 
the 
needs 
for 
addressing 
backlog 
maintenance 
on 
roads 
kept 
in 
a 
holding 
condition. 
The 
resource 
requirement 
for 
maintenance 
(routine 
and 
periodic) 
will 
be 
further 
developed, 
integrating 
the 
pavement 
management 
system 
with 
the maintenance 
management 
system 
in 
identifying 
the 
improvement 
and 
maintenance 
needs 
program 
for 
hture 
interventions. 
Network Planning. 
The 
network planning 
study 
conducted 
at 
the 
federal 
network 
level 
will 
be 
integrated 
with 
the 
regional and 
community 
road network 
studies 
to 
develop 
a 
prioritized 
national 
road network 
plan, 
consistent 
with 
the 
overall 
Government 
strategy 
and 
the 
macroeconomic 
environment. 
Road 
safety 
and axle 
load 
regulation 
and compliance. 
Recommendation 
from 
two 
completed 
studies 
will 
be 
implemented, 
inter 
alia, 
through: 
(a) 
upgrading 
and constructing 
weigh 
bridges; 
(b) 
improving 
efficiency 
of 
controlling 
mechanisms; (c) 
issuing 
legislation 
on 
axle 
load 
limit 
and 
penalties; 
and 
(d) 
licensing 
based 
on 
axle weight. 
The 
road 
safety awareness 
will 
be 
enhanced 
by: 
(a) 
establishing 
a 
National 
Safety 
Council; 
(b) 
enforcing 
traffic 
regulations; 
(c) 
awareness 
campaigns; 
(d) 
enforcing 
vehicle 
inspection; 
(e) 
enhancing 
coordination 
of 
stakeholder 
activities; 
as 
well 
as 
(f) 
implementation 
of 
the 
road 
safety 
action 
plan. 
Enhanced 
focus  on 
social 
and other 
development 
related 
impact 
of 
transport 
investments. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to: 
(a) 
preparing 
RAPS 
for 
all 
road 
projects; 
(b) 
including 
and 
enforcing 
social and environmental 
safeguard measures 
in 
all 
contracts; (c) 
creating 
awareness 
of, 
and 
protection 
measures against 
HIV/AIDS; 
and 
(d) 
improving 
efficiency 
of 
right-of-way 
management. 
The 
poverty 
and 
other development 
impact 
of 
investments 
in 
roads 
will 
be 
evaluated 
by 
launching 
the 
Corridor 
Development 
Study. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
3.1 
Issue: 
Improve quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
the 
road 
network 
and 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport. 
Strategy. 
The 
focus 
of 
RSDP 
11 
is 
to 
continue 
the 
momentum to 
achieve 
the 
road 
condition 
targets 
and 
to 
provide 
a 
sustainable 
level 
of 
essential 
road 
infrastructure 
to 
the 
rural 
population. 
The 
investment 
allocation priorities 
in 
the 
program 
are 
based 
on 
discussions 
with 
national 
stakeholders 
and 
interested 
donor 
partners and 
include: 
(i) 
roll-over 
of 
projects 
commenced 
under 
Phase 
I; 
(ii) 
road 
projects 
initially 
proposed 
under 
Phase 
1 
for which 
funding 
was 
not 
secured; 
(iii) 
roads 
connecting 
areas 
of 
agricultural 
-21 
- 
Page  28
and 
economic 
potential; 
(iv) 
missing 
links 
in 
terms 
of 
importance 
to 
the 
national 
economy and 
roads 
contributing 
to 
regional 
balance; 
and 
(v) 
the 
provision 
of 
Rural 
Transport 
Infrastructure, 
promotion 
of 
rural 
transport 
services, and 
ownership 
and 
use 
of 
Intermediate Means 
of 
transport, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ERTTP 
implementation. 
With 
respect 
to 
the latter, the 
emphasis 
would 
be 
on: 
(a) 
providing 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
assignment 
of 
responsibility 
and 
accountability, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
rural 
roads, 
rehabilitation 
and 
maintenance, 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
planning, 
programming 
and 
administration 
of 
contracts 
for 
existing 
regional 
roads force 
account 
units; 
(b) 
strengthening 
RRAs’ 
ability 
to 
coordinate 
project 
activities 
at the 
Zonal 
and 
wereda 
levels; 
and 
(c) 
constructing 
low 
cost roads, 
footpaths 
and 
trails, 
and 
projects 
that 
contribute to 
reducing 
the 
burden 
of 
travel 
and 
transport, 
such 
as 
village/community 
water 
wells, 
grinding 
mills, 
local 
markets, etc. 
To 
improve 
quality 
and 
extent 
of 
the 
road network 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
the 
Government 
has 
developed 
the 
Ethiopia 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport 
Program 
(ERTTP) 
based 
on 
the 
RRTPS 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
RRAs 
to 
coordinate 
the 
provision 
of 
rural 
transport 
infrastructure, 
means 
of 
transport 
and 
other 
associated services. 
Whilst 
the 
RRA 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
coordinating 
implementation 
activities, 
actual 
implementation 
will 
be 
led 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committees 
(WDCs) 
and the 
Village 
Development Committees 
(VDCs) 
and 
involving 
locally 
based 
NGOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
first 
step 
in 
implementation 
of 
the Program 
has 
started 
with 
Ireland 
Aid 
funding: 
(a) 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Source 
Book which 
describes 
the 
ERTTP 
concept 
and 
approach and 
provides 
guidelines 
for 
the participatory 
identification 
of 
needed 
interventions 
and 
institutional 
and 
financing 
frameworks 
for 
implementation; 
(b) 
preparation 
of 
Wereda 
Travel 
and 
Transport 
Plans 
(WTTP) 
for 
eight 
pilot 
weredas; 
and 
(c) 
regional 
workshops 
for 
awareness 
creation. 
Implementation 
of 
these 
WTTPs 
in 
the 
pilot 
weredas 
will 
take 
place 
during 
APL 
1 
with 
funding 
by 
Ireland 
Aid 
and 
DFID. 
3.2 
Issue: 
Institutional 
Reform 
and Commercialization 
of 
ERA 
operations. 
Strategy. 
At 
present 
ERA 
is 
in 
a 
much 
better 
position 
than 
it 
was 
when RSDP 
was launched. 
The 
restructuring

had 
a 
major 
effect 
on

and 
future 
capacity 
of

As 
part 
of 
RSDP

process 
would 
be 
reinforced, 
especially 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
(a) 
capacity 
to 
plan, procure 
and 
administer 
civil 
construction 
and 
service contracts 
and 
manage 
contract 
claims and

contract administration, engineering 
design 
review, 
claims 
avoidance and dispute 
handling 
and 
financial 
management, 
accounting 
and 
control 
systems; 
(b) 
develop 
each maintenance 
district 
into 
self-accounting 
business 
units, 
capable 
of 
producing 
and 
implementing 
cost-effective 
annual 
maintenance 
programs; 
(c) 
create 
clear 
accountability 
for 
performance and 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
a 
competitive 
contractual relationship between 
those 
doing 
the 
work 
(Contractor) 
and 
those 
requiring 
it 
to

; 
(d) 
develop

contractors 
to 
undertake 
routine 
road 
maintenance 
work 
in 
addition 
to 
increasing 
their 
participation 
in 
civil 
work 
contracts; also encourage 
large 
local 
contractors 
to 
engage 
in 
routine 
maintenance 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
large 
packages 
of 
work, 
such 
as 
“term 
contract”  and “performance  based 
contracts”; 
(e) 
update

Strategy. 
The 
Government 
is 
implementing 
recommendations 
from 
its 
program 
document 
“Capacity 
Building 
Program 
in 
the 
Construction 
Sector” 
(March 
2001) 
drawn 
from 
a 
domestic construction 
industry 
assessment 
study 
financed 
with 
PHRD 
funds. 
The 
draft 
proposal 
includes private 
sector 
development, 
including 
private participation 
in 
delivery 
and 
financing, 
as 
well 
as 
possible contracting out 
of 
management 
functions 
by 
ERA 
for 
the 
expanded 
program 
under 
RSDP 
11. 
The 
Government 
is 
in 
the 
process

assessing 
the 
feasibility, options and 
additional 
requirements 
for

investment and financing. 
Key 
focus 
of 
the 
Government's approach 
will 
be 
on: 
(a) 
strengthening 
Domestic Construction 
Industry 
(Del). 
Enhance 
opportunities 
for 
the 
DCI, 
through: 
(i) 
identification 
of 
specific 
constraints 
and 
mitigating 
measures 
and an 
action 
plan 
developed 
to 
satisfy 
the 
agreed objective. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
proposed 
strategy, 
capacity 
of 
local 
contractors 
and 
consultants 
would 
be 
enhanced, 
training provided 
and contract 
documents 
of 
Govemment financed 
projects reformed. 
In 
addition, domestic contractors 
participation 
in 
major road 
works 
contracts 
would 
be 
enhanced, 
inter 
alia, 
through revised packaging 
of 
contracts; 
(6) 
based maintenance 
methods, 
a 
total 
of 
8,000 
km 
of 
district 
roads 
have 
been 
identified 
(out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
17,000 
km) 
which 
can 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
length-person 
system. 
The 
initial 
target 
is 
to 
have 
800 
km 
in 
each 
district maintained 
using 
length-person 
system 
over 
the 
next 
four 
years. 
A 
new 
labor 
based 
manual 
has 
been prepared and 
procedures 
for 
implementation through 
the 
DMOs 
have 
been finalized. 
The 
principal 
target 
group 
for 
this 
activity 
will 
be 
the 
small 
emerging 
contractors 
and 
community 
based 
organizations 
within 
each 
district, 
who 
will 
be 
provided training 
on 
labor-based maintenance contracting; 
supporting 
labor-based 
maintenance 
methods 
(LBM). 
As 
part 
of 
providing 
support 
to 
labor 
(c) 
deteriorating 
condition 
of 
maintenance 
equipment, 
arrangements 
for 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
equipment 
including 
possible 
plant 
leasing 
will 
be 
identified 
and implemented.  One 
of 
the 
options 
considered 
would 
be 
to 
establish 
commercially 
operated 
plant 
pools 
in 
support 
of 
which 
specific 
proposals and 
action 
plan 
will 
be 
developed. 
It 
is 
also 
proposed 
to 
develop 
a 
systems 
approach 
to 
provide 
adequate 
planning, 
forecasting, 
controlling, 
and 
information 
and 
management 
systems 
appropriate 
to 
supporting 
a substantial 
fleet 
of

Strategy. 
The 
road 
maintenance 
needs 
are 
expected 
to 
increase 
in 
the 
future 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
density 
and 
coverage 
of 
the 
road 
network. 
While 
the 
current 
dedicated 
funding 
for 
road 
maintenance 
is 
sufficient to 
address 
about 
80-90 
percent 
of 
the 
assessed 
maintenance 
needs, 
this 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
the 
case 
in 
future 
when 
maintenance 
needs increase. 
The 
focus 
of 
the 
strategy 
will 
be 
to: 
(a) 
clearly 
identify 
the 
mechanism 
to 
meet 
the 
shortfall, and Govemment 
has 
reflected 
its 
commitment 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Policy to 
give 
priority 
to 
maintenance 
needs; 
(b) 
improve 
resource 
mobilization 
and 
allocation. 
The 
road network planning 
and 
programming 
scope 
would 
need 
to 
adequately 
reflect 
the 
changing 
scope 
and 
volume 
of 
annual 
maintenance 
need. 
ERA 
will 
plan 
and 
monitor 
implementation 
in 
two 
critical 
areas 
of 
routineh-ecurrent maintenance 
needs 
for: 
(i) 
maintainable 
roads 
comprising 
mainly 
the 
recently 
improved 
roads 
and 
other roads 
in 
"good" and 
"fair" 
condition; 
as 
well 
as 
(ii) 
roads 
normally 
kept 
passable 
in 
a 
"holding 
state" 
while 
awaiting 
major road 
improvementshehabilitation. 
Efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources 
will 
be 
improved 
by 
expanding 
the 
scope 
of 
performance contract 
agreements 
to 
DMOs 
and 
RRAs. 
Arrangements 
for 
carrying 
out 
maintenance 
performance audits 
by 
the 
Road 
Fund 
Administration 
would 
be 
finalized; and 
(c) 
explore 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
financing 
of 
road 
infrastructure. 
Options 
for 
commercializing 
maintenance 
activities 
would 
be 
developed 
with 
a 
view 
to 
reduce 
overhead costs 
and 
improve efficiency 
and 
accountability 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
services. 
One 
of 
the 
options 
to 
be 
being 
developed 
for 
implementation 
is 
"term 
maintenance" 
which 
eventually 
lead 
to 
area-wide, 
multi-year performance 
based 
maintenance contracts 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
a 
single 
contract 
over 
an extended 
period 
of 
time; 
(d) 
ensure 
ownership 
of 
the 
proposed 
program 
by 
the 
communities 
by 
exploring 
options 
for 
participating regionskommunities to contribute 
up 
to 
about 
40% 
of 
the cost 
of 
the 
low-level 
rural 
road 
development 
projects.

on 
the

of 
the

to 
address 
food

into 
account 
the 
interdependence among 
different 
levels 
of

and 
the 
need 
to 
address 
community 
infrastructure, 
services 
and 
safety 
related 
issues. 
The 
Road Corridor

the 
planning 
requirements 
of 
local 
communities

the 
corridor 
of 
the 
roads 
under 
consideration. 
Most 
importantly, 
the 
study 
of 
road 
investment 
impact 
on 
poverty 
will 
help 
to: 
(i) 
develop an 
empirical 
approach 
to 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
road 
investments 
on 
poverty 
alleviation; 
and 
(ii)

4.1 
Program 
Description. 
The 
proposed 
Program 
will 
be implemented 
in 
four 
stages 
(APL1-4). 
The 
start 
up 
of 
the 
Program’s 
four 
stages 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
measured 
progress 
of 
implementation 
of 
components 
of 
each 
stage 
and 
the 
associated 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms, 
especially 
the 
readiness 
of 
the 
programs and contract 
awards 
for 
planned 
physical 
investments. 
The Program 
would 
support 
Federal 
Roads 
and 
Regional 
Roads 
rehabilitation 
and 
implementation 
of 
ERTTP. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Program 
would 
prepare 
sectorial 
work 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
road 
management 
and financing, environmental and social impact 
assessment 
and 
mitigation, 
social/poverty impact 
assessments 
along corridors, 
as 
well 
as

3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
Program, 
through 
rehabilitation, 
strengthening 
and 
upgrading 
of 
the 
national road 
network 
benefits 
the 
country’s economy 
and 
supports 
the 
major 
institutional reforms 
in 
the 
sector 
related 
to 
commercialization 
of 
the 
management 
and 
procurement functions 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
and 
provision 
of 
a 
sustained 
financial 
source 
for 
road 
maintenance. 
The 
road works 
would 
lead to 
substantial 
savings 
in 
vehicle 
operating 
and 
infrastructure 
maintenance 
costs, 
as 
well 
as 
reductions 
in 
travel 
time 
and 
transport 
costs 
for 
road 
users 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Since 
the 
identified 
sub-components 
are 
part 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
country-wide 
investment 
strategy 
for 
road 
development, 
they 
would 
contribute 
to 
fostering 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty alleviation through 
improvements 
in 
market integration 
and 
accessibility 
to 
transport 
infrastructure and 
basic 
social 
services. 
These 
anticipated impacts 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
strengthening 
economic infrastructure, 
which 
has 
been 
identified 
in 
the 
CAS 
as 
a 
key 
element 
in 
GOE’s 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
The 
target 
population 
would 
include: 
road 
users 
(includingpedestrians, 
IMTs/NMVs 
users 
and 
non-transport 
structure/sewices 
beneficiaries), 
who 
would 
benefit 
through improvement 
in 
road 
surfaces, 
availability 
of 
all-weather 
roads 
and 
road 
safety; 
producers and 
consumers, 
through 
improved 
access 
to 
municipal 
andor 
other 
basic 
social 
services, 
and 
in 
the transport 
of 
goods 
to 
the 
local 
markets 
and 
environmental protection; 
domestic 
construction industry, 
through 
enhanced 
opportunities 
to 
participate 
in 
business 
opportunities; 
road 
agencies, 
through 
improved 
management 
practices; and 
finance ministry, 
through 
greater 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources 
and 
reduced 
demands 
placed 
on 
the 
national 
budget 
for 
road 
development and maintenance.

Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
1. 
Administrative. 
The 
overall program 
coordination 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority 
(ERA), 
the 
legally 
autonomous 
Federal 
Government 
Road 
Agency. 
ERA 
will 
also 
manage 
and 
administer 
the 
Trunk 
and 
Major 
Link 
Roads Program, 
and 
initially, 
the 
ERTTP. 
ERA 
is 
organized 
into 
three 
main 
departments 
as 
follows: 
(A) 
Regulatory 
and 
Engineering 
Services 
Department, 
which 
carries 
out 
its 
responsibilities through 
four Divisions: 
Planning 
and 
Programming, 
Contracts 
Administration 
and 
Right-of-way, 
Contracts 
Formulation 
and 
Design 
Review, 
Research 
and 
Network 
Management, 
and 
the 
District 
Engineering; 
(B) 
Operations 
Department, 
which 
has 
responsibility 
for 
force 
account maintenance, emergency 
road 
construction and 
maintenance, 
and 
associated 
logistics 
support; 
and 
(C) 
Human 
Resource 
and 
Financial 
Management 
Department 
which 
carries 
out 
its 
responsibility 
through 
three 
Divisions 
Finance, 
Human 
Resources 
Development 
and 
Personnel 
Administration. 
Under 
its 
Planning 
and 
Programming 
Division 
of 
Department 
(A), 
ERA 
has 
six 
Branches responsible 
for 
Planning 
and 
Program 
Management, 
Programming 
and 
Budgeting, 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation, 
Management 
Information 
Systems 
(MIS), 
Environmental 
Management, and 
Rural 
Roads 
Technical 
Support. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
broad 
organizational 
setup 
for 
implementing 
the 
RSDP, 
ERA 
has 
set 
up 
a 
Program 
Advisory 
Office 
(PAO) 
under 
the 
General Manager. 
Staff 
of 
the 
PA0 
have 
been supported 
by 
technical 
assistance 
(TA), 
comprising 
an 
RSDP 
Advisor 
(a 
senior 
highway 
engineedcivil 
works 
contract 
administration 
specialist) 
funded 
by 
the 
EC, 
who 
is 
on 
the 
second 
three-year 
term 
of 
his 
assignment. 
The 
PA0 
advise 
the 
General 
Manager 
on 
matters 
related to program 
coordination, 
including 
the 
coordination 
of 
TA 
and 
the 
related 
multi-donor 
support 
and 
interests. 
In 
addition, 
a 
Road 
Inspectorate 
has 
been 
established 
which 
is 
accountable 
to 
ERA 
Board to 
provide 
independent 
inspection 
and 
monitoring 
reports 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
road 
sector 
operations. 
Maintenance 
of 
the 
federal 
trunk 
and 
link 
toads 
required 
to 
preserve 
the 
new 
road 
investments 
and 
keep 
existing 
roads 
passable, 
will 
be 
carried out 
both 
by 
the 
District 
Maintenance 
Offices 
of 
ERA, 
which 
is 
currently 
in 
the 
process 
of 
commercialization, 
and 
by 
private 
contractors, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
agreed 
Maintenance 
Action 
Plan. 
The 
Regional 
Roads 
Authorities 
(RRAs), 
which 
have been 
set 
up 
as 
legally 
autonomous 
Regional 
Governments 
Road 
Agencies, 
are 
responsible 
for 
managing 
and 
administering 
the 
Regional 
Roads 
Program. 
They 
will 
also 
maintain 
the 
regional 
roads 
either 
directly, 
or 
by 
contract 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
capacity. 
Village 
Development Committees 
(VDCs) 
whose 
activities 
would 
be 
organized 
and 
coordinated 
by 
Wereda 
Development Committees (WDCs) 
and 
the 
Wereda 
Rural 
Development 
Office 
will 
implement 
the 
Ethiopian 
Rural 
Travel 
and Transport 
Program 
(ERTTP). 
The 
WDCs 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
Regional Program 
Coordination 
Boards 
(RPCBs), 
and a 
Central Program Coordinating 
Board 
(CPCB). 
The 
CPCB, 
whose secretariat 
is 
ERA, 
will 
assume 
the 
leading 
role 
in 
policy 
formulation, 
legal 
dispositions, regulation, 
awareness 
development, 
and 
providing 
technical 
guidance 
and 
support, 
while 
the 
RPCBs, 
whose secretariats 
are 
RRAs, 
will 
guide, 
monitor 
the 
planning 
and execution 
of 
ERTTP 
initiatives. 
With 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
new 
Cabinet 
of 
Ministers, 
in 
October 
2001, 
a 
Ministry 
of 
Infrastructure 
has 
been 
formed 
with 
the 
responsibility 
of 
developing 
the 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
nation. 
This 
new 
ministry 
has 
taken over 
all 
the 
duties 
of 
the 
previous 
Ministry 
of 
Transport and Communications, 
the 
electric 
power 
function 
of 
the 
previous 
Ministry 
of 
Mines 
and 
Energy, 
and 
partially 
the 
duties 
(the 
works 
part) 
of 
the 
previous 
Ministry 
of 
Works 
and 
Urban 
Development. 
Under 
this 
new 
arrangement 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
executive 
agencies 
that 
are 
accountable 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Infrastructure. 
Among 
them 
are 
the 
Ethiopian 
Road 
Authority, 
the 
Civil 
Aviation 
Authority, 
the 
Roads 
Transport 
Authority, 
and 
the 
Ethiopian 
Road 
Fund. 
Having 
these 
key 
authorities 
that 
are 
involved 
with 
the 
different 
aspects 
of 
the 
transport 
sector 
under 
the 
same 
umbrella 
is 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
efficient 
resolution 
of 
the 
key 
crosscutting 
sectoral 
- 
28 
- 
Page  35
issues, 
without 
compromising 
the 
autonomy 
of 
the 
ERA. 
The 
responsibility 
for 
the 
administration 
of 
matters 
affecting 
the 
(DCI) 
including 
registration, 
local 
contract document 
certification, and 
approval, 
as 
well 
as 
implementation 
of 
the proposed capacity 
building 
program 
is 
also 
expected 
to 
fall 
under 
the 
same 
Ministry. 
These 
responsibilities 
were 
previously 
under 
the 
former 
Ministry 
of 
Works 
and 
Urban 
Development. 
The 
other 
aspect 
relates 
to 
the 
central coordination 
body 
for 
the 
ERTTP 
at 
the 
federal 
level, 
which 
is 
now 
benefiting 
from 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Rural 
Development 
which 
has 
also 
appointed the chair 
of 
the 
CPCB. 
This 
arrangement 
facilitates 
implementation 
by 
providing 
a 
direct 
linkage 
with 
the 
key 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
ERTTP, 
the 
rural 
community. 
The administration 
of 
the 
Road 
Fund 
is 
presently 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Road 
Fund 
Administration 
(RFA) 
under 
the 
Road 
Fund 
Board 
comprising 
representatives 
of 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
Regional 
States, 
ERA 
and 
local 
stakeholders. 
This 
arrangement 
is 
to 
continue. 
2. 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority 
under 
its 
Contract 
Administration 
Division 
or 
other 
divisions 
designated 
by 
the 
General 
Manager 
or 
the 
Deputy 
General 
Manager, 
Engineering 
and Regulation, 
with 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
ERA 
Board. 
Institutional 
Support 
to 
ERA 
for 
planning 
and procurement 
of 
projects, 
design 
review 
and 
approval, 
contract administration, claims 
avoidance 
and 
management 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
under 
this 
project. 
The 
IDA-finance 
under 
APLl 
and 
financing 
by 
other 
donor 
partners 
- 
AfDB, 
DFID, 
EC, 
would 
further 
equip 
ERA 
to 
implement 
the 
full 
scope 
of 
the 
procurement and 
contract administration 
responsibilities 
required 
for 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
implementation. 
It 
is 
further 
confirmed 
that procurement 
thresholds 
set 
in 
Government procurement regulations 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Economic 
Development 
now 
provide 
ERA 
management 
with 
authorization 
to 
approve 
procurement 
transactions 
of 
ETB 
2 
million 
(or 
about US$230,000 
equivalent),  an increase 
from 
ETB 
250,000 (about 
US$30,000 
equivalent). 
This 
is 
a 
positive 
step 
towards 
the 
expedition 
of 
procurement 
for 
road 
work 
activities 
which 
often 
require 
frequent 
purchase 
of 
spares 
and 
consumable 
items. 
Procurement 
(See 
Annex 
6(A) 
for 
further 
details). 
Procurement 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
Civil 
works 
will 
be 
awarded 
to 
pre-qualified 
contractors 
through 
international 
andor 
national 
competitive 
bidding 
procedures 
as 
appropriate 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
Guidelines 
for 
Procurement 
under 
IBRD 
Loans and 
IDA 
Credits 
published 
by 
the 
Bank 
with 
latest 
revision 
on 
January 1999. 
All 
associated supervision, 
as 
well 
as 
TA 
and 
other consultant 
services, 
will 
be 
awarded 
to 
qualifying 
consulting 
firms 
(international 
and 
locally 
reputable and 
qualified 
firms) 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
Guidelines 
for 
Selection and Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World Bunk 
Borrowers 
(January 1997, 
lastly 
revised 
January 
1999 
and 
May 
2002).

reporting 
system 
of 
ERA 
is 
capable 
of 
producing 
accurate 
and 
reliable 
information 
regarding 
project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
The 
system 
will 
provide reliable 
records and reports 
on all 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
financial 
transactions 
of 
the 
project, and 
sufficient financial 
information 
for 
managing 
and 
monitoring 
activities. 
ERA’S 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
designed 
to 
produce 
financial 
statements 
of 
the 
entity 
as 
a 
whole to 
be 
used 
by 
all 
donors 
and 
the 
government.

The overall 
program 
and 
project 
management 
and 
coordination 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority 
(ERA). 
ERA 
will 
manage 
all 
the 
components 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
APL, 
but 
in 
the 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
APL, 
the 
Regional 
Roads 
Authorities 
(RRAs) 
and 
Ethiopian 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport 
Program 
(ERTTP) 
Offices 
at 
all 
levels 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation. Currently, 
Ireland 
Aid 
and 
DFID 
are 
financing 
the 
pilot 
implementation 
of 
ERTTP 
physical 
activities 
in 
8 
weredas, 
and 
their 
experience 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
designing 
the

implementation and 
fund 
flow 
arrangements 
in 
the 
second 
and 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
APL. 
ERA 
is 
currently 
implementing 
two 
active 
projects financed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
Road 
Sector 
Development Program 
Support 
Project 
(RSDPSP, 
Cr. 
3032-ET) 
and 
components 
from 
Emergency 
Recovery Project 
(Cr. 
3438-ET). 
ERA 
had 
implemented 
various 
donor-financed projects 
in 
the 
past 
successfully, 
including 
the 
RRP 
(Cr. 
2438-ET), 
which 
was 
closed 
in 
December 
2002. 
In 
the 
existing 
active projects 
and 
the 
already closed 
ones, 
management 
and administration 
of 
funds 
are 
done at a 
central 
level 
by 
ERA 
and 
there 
has 
been 
no 
problem 
in 
disbursements 
and accounting 
of 
funds. 
ERA 
will 
open a Special 
Account 
(SA) 
at the 
National Bank 
of 
Ethiopia. 
IDA 
will 
transfer the 
initial 
advance 
and 
subsequent deposits 
to 
the 
created 
SA. 
ERA 
will 
then 
pay 
contractors and 
suppliers 
from 
the 
SA. 
Currently, the 
Audit 
Services 
Corporation 
is 
the 
external 
auditor 
of 
ERA. 
This 
arrangement 
will 
continue 
for 
the 
future. 
The 
annual 
audited 
financial 
statements, 
along 
with 
the 
management 
letter, 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
not 
later than 
six 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year. 
ERA 
will 
produce quarterly 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
and 
submit 
the 
same 
to 
IDA 
45 days 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each quarter. 
The 
FMRs 
will 
include 
financial, 
physical 
progress 
and procurement 
information. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
the 
financial 
reports 
must 
include 
the 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
funds, 
expenditures 
by 
main 
expenditure classifications, 
beginning 
and 
ending 
cash balances 
and other 
supporting 
schedules. 
ERA 
agreed 
to 
use 
Form 
2 
of 
the 
FMR 
for 
reporting 
purposes 
during 
negotiation.

the 
Bank. 
The 
first 
is 
the 
traditional- 
disbursement 
method, 
which 
uses 
SA, SOE and 
direct payment 
procedures. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
report-based method, 
in 
which 
regular 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMR) 
plus 
additional 
statements 
will 
be 
the 
basis 
for 
disbursement. 
ERA 
has selected 
the 
traditional 
way 
of 
disbursement 
using 
SA,

Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
1. 
detailed 
engineering 
studies 
for 
versus 
a 
phased 
implementation under 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Loan 
(APL). 
The 
former 
was 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
latter 
to 
allow for 
a phased 
implementation 
of 
the 
overall program 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
view 
of: 
(i) 
ERA'S 
capacity 
to 
manage 
programs; 
and 
(ii) 
need 
to 
ensure 
step-by-step 
achievement 
of 
key 
policy 
and 
institutional reforms 
critical 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
program. 
The phasing 
will 
also 
allow 
a 
systematic 
build 
up 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
which 
will 
be 
needed especially 
at 
the 
APL 
versus 
SIL. 
The 
alternatives considered 
included 
updating 
the 
economic 
feasibility 
and 
selected 
roads 
before 
implementation 
under 
a 
Sector 
Investment 
Loan, 
-

Page  37
regional 
and wereda 
levels, and 
the 
associated 
procurement processing 
through 
an 
APL 
instrument. 
In 
this 
connection, 
implementation 
of 
each 
road 
sub-component 
has 
been 
contingent 
on 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
following 
criteria: 
(i) 
economic 
viability 
established 
through an 
ERR 
of 
12% 
or 
above 
for 
federal 
roads; 
(ii) 
socioeconomic 
justification 
to 
be 
confirmed 
for 
the 
rural 
transport 
infrastructure under 
ERTTP; 
(iii) 
completion 
of 
bid 
documents 
for 
contract 
award; 
and 
(iv) 
when 
warranted, 
environmental/resettlement 
mitigation 
plans satisfactory 
to 
IDA. 
These 
criteria 
will 
be 
further 
tested 
during 
preparation 
of 
each 
subsequent 
Stage 
and 
fulfilled 
prior 
to 
proceeding 
with 
implementation. 
2. 
IDA 
Grant 
vs. 
IDA 
Credit: 
Five 
criteria 
have 
been 
set 
out 
by 
IDA 
donors 
as 
part 
of 
the 
IDA 
13 
replenishment framework: 
(i) 
HrV/AIDS, 
(ii) 
natural 
disaster, 
(iii) 
post-conflict, 
(iv) 
poorest 
IDA-only 
country, 
or 
(v) 
particularly 
debt-vulnerable 
poorest 
IDA-only 
country. 
Ethiopia qualifies under 
the 
fourth 
and 
fifth 
criteria 
(and 
with 
the 
recent drought, 
probably 
the 
second 
criterion). 
The 
RSDP 
I1 
(APL1) 
has 
been allocated 
100% grant 
financing 
from 
IDA 
so 
as 
to maintain 
the 
priority 
required 
for 
addressing 
the 
road 
transport 
and 
access 
needs 
to 
support the 
growth 
objectives 
of 
Ethiopia’s 
SDPRF’. 
APL 
1 
(i) 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
to 
address 
the 
social 
aspects 
of 
transport 
(through 
monitored 
outcomes 
related 
to 
the 
MDGs) 
such 
as 
mitigation 
of 
HIV-AIDS 
and 
other 
adverse 
social impact 
of 
investments, 
and 
provision 
of 
increased 
income 
and 
employment 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Ethiopian 
private 
sector 
and 
the 
rural 
poor 
along 
road 
corridors;  and 
(ii) 
establishes 
the 
plans 
and programs 
for 
achieving 
holistic 
improvements 
to 
the 
access 
and 
mobility 
situation 
of 
the 
rural 
and 
urban 
poor 
and 
their 
livelihood. 
3. 
Developing public-private partnership 
versus 
continued 
reliance on 
public 
sector 
based 
institutions 
in 
delivery, 
$financing 
and 
implementation 
of 
Project 
components. 
The 
alternatives considered 
include: 
(i) 
increasing 
ERA 
capacity 
through 
staff 
recruitment 
and training 
to 
the 
level 
required 
for 
the expanded 
program 
under 
Phase 
11, 
versus, 
(ii) 
possible 
contracting out 
of 
management 
functions 
by 
ERA 
to 
specialized 
private 
firms 
for 
managing 
the 
implementation 
of 
selected 
groups 
of 
contracts 
under 
the 
program, 
or 
(iii) 
implementing 
a 
mixture 
of 
the 
options. 
Option 
(iii) 
is 
favored 
since 
it 
allows 
the 
benefits 
gained 
from 
strengthening 
ERA’S 
capacity 
in 
contract 
administration, 
sector 
planning 
and 
program coordination 
to 
be 
sustained. 
The 
additional 
options 
included 
private 
sector 
development 
(PSD) 
to 
increase PS 
participation 
in 
delivery, 
financing 
and 
implementation.  The 
June 
2002 
workshop 
on 
public-private 
partnerships 
in 
Roads 
held 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
contributed 
to 
creating 
awareness 
of 
cross-country experience and 
opportunities 
which 
enabled 
GOE 
to 
further 
explore 
the 
ways 
of 
improving 
public-private 
sector 
investment 
and 
financing. 
Available 
options 
to 
be 
explored 
under 
the 
proposed 
project include: 
domestic 
financial 
capital 
markets; 
public-private 
partnerships 
with 
different 
mechanisms 
for 
government support 
and 
incentives; 
possible off-budget 
resources such 
as 
additional 
levy 
on 
fuel 
for 
the 
road 
fund; 
and 
increased domestic 
contractor 
participation 
in 
roadwork 
contracts. 
Institutional 
reform 
options 
for 
ERA. 
4. 
development 
impact 
related 
issues. 
The 
alternatives considered 
include: 
(i) 
improving 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
the 
road network 
as 
measured 
through 
engineering performance 
based parameters, 
such 
as 
length 
of 
network, 
roughness 
index, 
measurable 
benefits 
(reduced 
VOC); 
versus 
(ii) 
improving 
social, 
development, 
environmental, 
institutional 
and operational 
impact 
of 
investments 
in 
the 
sector 
(in 
addition 
to 
engineering 
standards). 
Option 
(ii) 
was 
favored 
since 
it 
directly 
links 
RSDP 
I1 
activities 
with 
the 
GOE’s 
SDPRP 
and 
the 
MDG 
thus 
enhancing 
its 
contribution 
to 
poverty 
alleviation. 
Accordingly, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
parameters 
have 
been 
developed 
to 
measure 
improved 
access, 
employment 
opportunities, 
gender 
impact, 
capacity 
of 
domestic contractors, 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
network, financing 
for 
road 
maintenance, 
improved 
safety 
standards, 
mitigating 
HIV/AIDS 
impact, 
etc.

RRA 
capacity 
for 
planning, 
contract 
management 
and 
executing 
of 
maintenance 
of 
regional 
rural 
roads 
and 
community 
roads, 
versus 
building 
RRA 
capacity 
for 
planning 
and 
programming 
with 
associated 
training, 
with 
works 
contracted out 
to private 
contractors; 
and 
weredas 
given 
responsibility 
for 
planning 
and 
execution 
of 
interventions 
relating 
to 
community 
roads. 
The 
latter 
was 
chosen 
as 
the 
model 
for 
implementation, 
as 
it 
provides 
a 
less 
expensive 
alternative 
to 
building 
up 
capacity 
at the 
local 
level 
for 
managing and 
execution 
of 
road 
works. 
Institutional 
reform

The 
alternatives considered

Major 
related 
projects financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and/or other 
development 
agencies 
(completed, 
ongoing and 
planned). 
There 
are 
two 
ongoing 
Bank-financed projects 
in 
the 
road 
sector whose 
implementation 
is 
underway 
satisfactorily: 
(1) 
the

trunk 
routes, 
with 
a 
total 
length 
of 
about 
1380 
km; 
(ii) 
consultancy 
services 
for 
supervision 
of 
the 
above 
civil 
works; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
Establishment

Inspectorate 
Office. 
(2) 
Emergency 
Recovery 
and 
Reconstruction 
Project 
(Cr. 
3438-ET),  has 
a 
road 
component 
covering 
maintenance 
and rehabilitation. 
The

In 
addition, 
the 
European Commission 
has 
continued 
its 
support 
to 
the 
RSDP 
with 
technical 
assistance 
and 
institutional 
support 
to 
ERA 
including 
policy

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
The 
importance 
of 
a 
realistic 
planning 
and 
programming 
within 
achievable goals 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
lessons 
that 
has 
been 
drawn from 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I. 
The 
targets 
set 
for 
RSDP 
I 
have 
not 
been 
fully 
realized 
partly 
because 
of 
inadequate 
funding 
and 
lack 
of 
capacity. 
The 
program 
objectives 
and 
targets 
therefore 
were 
reviewed 
and 
re-assessed 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
actual 
and 
projected 
progress 
in 
implementation, 
and 
how 
that 
could 
affect 
planning 
and 
programming 
for 
RSDP 
II 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
realism 
of 
proposed 
targets, 
the 
implementation 
capacity and budgetary 
requirements. 
The 
early 
capacity 
building 
provided 
to 
ERA 
in 
contract 
administration, 
financial 
management 
and 
planning 
served 
as 
the 
bedrock 
for 
the 
effective 
procurement processing and contract 
management 
on 
the 
program, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
reconciliation 
and 
bringing 
up 
to 
date, 
the 
ERA 
entity 
accounts. 
The 
experience 
gained 
in 
RSDP 
I 
further 
shows 
the 
importance 
of 
maintaining 
support 
to 
ERA 
for 
the 
continued 
establishment 
and 
implementation 
of 
effective 
functions 
for 
contract 
administration, 
financial 
management, 
planning 
and 
programming and review 
and 
approval 
of 
road 
designs 
identified 
for 
RSDP 
11. 
ERA’S 
proactive 
consultation 
and 
coordination 
of 
support 
from 
all 
agencies 
of 
Government 
- 
including 
customs and 
regulatory 
agencies, 
greatly 
improved 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
civil 
works 
program 
as 
compared 
to 
works 
executed 
prior 
to 
the 
start 
of 
RSDP. 
The 
experience gained 
would 
be 
further 
improved 
and 
extended 
in 
RSDP 
11. 
In 
this 
connection, 
the importance 
of 
ensuring 
finished 
designs 
and 
finished 
contract 
processing, 
as 
well 
as 
thorough 
pre-screening 
of 
contractors at 
pre-qualification 
stage 
have 
been 
essential prerequisites 
for 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
ongoing 
road 
improvement 
contracts. 
The 
association 
of 
local 
professionals 
and 
technicians 
with 
international 
firms 
have 
provided 
the ingredient 
for 
essential 
capacity 
building 
in 
the domestic 
private 
consulting 
industry, 
and 
for 
effective 
implementation 
of 
consultancy 
services 
within 
the 
country. 
Additional 
lessons 
drawn 
from 
RSDP 
I 
and 
reflected 
in 
RSDP 
I1 
project 
design 
include 
the 
need

their 
social 
needs. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
recipient 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
Four 
main 
factors 
are 
indicative 
of 
the 
Recipient’s 
commitment 
to 
the 
Program. 
First, 
Government 
considers 
the 
availability 
of 
basic 
road 
infrastructure 
as 
a 
key 
strategic 
element 
in 
implementation 
of 
the 
country’s  economic 
program 
as 
well 
as 
the 
core 
of 
its 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
As 
part 
of 
that commitment, 
ERA 
has 
prepared 
a 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
(2002-2007), 
with 
details 
on 
the 
road 
network, 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I, 
and 
progress made 
in 
the past 
five 
years, 
proposed 
works 
and 
improvements 
under 
RSDP 
II, 
specific 
targets 
to 
be 
realized 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Program. 
Various 
other 
studies 
have 
been 
completed, 
such 
as 
the 
Reform 
Study 
of 
ERA, 
the 
District 
Maintenance Organization Capacity 
Building 
(with 
support 
from 
DFID),

road 
master 
plan. 
ERA 
has 
developed 
a 
“Policy 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
of 
the 
Road 
Sector” (December  2002), 
with 
information 
on 
issues 
related 
to 
institutional 
strengthening, 
human 
resource development, 
road 
maintenance 
systems, 
capacity 
building 
at 
different 
levels 
and 
policy 
issues 
of 
the 
sector. 
In 
addition, 
a 
Maintenance 
Action 
Plan 
(2002-2007)  has 
been 
prepared 
with 
details 
on 
maintenance 
activities 
and 
identification 
of 
how 
maintenance 
contributes 
to 
improving road 
condition 
and 
reducing road 
roughness. 
Maintenance 
priorities 
are 
considered 
together 
with 
optimal 
maintenance 
policy. 
Finally, 
GOE 
has 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
ERTTP 
by 
adopting 
it 
as 
a 
key 
instrument 
of 
policy 
on 
rural 
development 
and 
setting 
up 
an 
inter-ministerial 
Board 
to 
oversee 
its 
implementation. 
Second, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Capacity 
Building 
(MCB) 
through 
its 
Construction 
Sector 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
(CSCBP) 
is 
embarking 
on 
a 
human 
resource 
development 
program 
which 
includes 
training 
of 
foremen, operators, 
and 
managers 
of 
local 
contracting 
firms 
for 
road 
construction works. 
In 
addition, 
in 
the 
APL 
1 
domestic contractors 
with 
experience 
in 
building 
gravel 
roads 
will 
be 
given 
opportunity 
to 
build 
up 
their 
capacity 
to 
execute 
works 
to 
paved 
road 
surface standards. 
Third, 
Government 
has, 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Road 
Fund, 
assured a steady 
financing 
for 
road 
maintenance, 
in 
real 
terms, 
showing 
commitment 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
proposed 
investments. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
updated 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Policy, 
Government 
has 
renewed 
its 
commitment 
to 
addressing 
road 
maintenance 
as 
a 
top 
priority. 
Fourth, 
as 
part 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP, Government 
has 
monitored 
the 
policy 
aspects 
included 
in 
its 
December 1998 
Letter 
of 
Road 
Sector 
Policy, 
with 
a 
specific 
focus 
on 
further 
strengthening 
the 
administration 
and 
management 
of 
federal, 
regional 
and 
rural 
road 
network, 
improving 
performance 
of 
maintenance works, 
strengthening 
capacity 
of 
local 
construction 
industry 
and 
reorienting 
the 
public 
expenditure 
to 
increase 
the 
overall 
size 
of 
the 
road 
budget. 
Government 
is 
also 
exploring 
alternative 
sources 
of 
financing 
including 
public-private 
partnership 
in 
financing. 
Nineteen 
indicators 
were 
developed 
to 
monitor 
the 
impact 
of 
RSDP 
I 
on 
an 
annual 
basis, 
which 
include: 
(1) 
road 
density; 
(2) 
traffic flow; 
(3) roughness 
and 
road 
condition; 
(4) 
vehicle operating 
costs; 
(5) 
freight 
and 
passenger 
fares; 
(6) 
fatalities 
and 
accidents; 
(7) 
travel 
time; 
(8) 
maintenance 
budget 
and 
expenditure; 
(9) 
kilometers 
maintained; 
(lo) 
maintenance 
cost; 
(1 
1) 
time 
elapsed 
for

time 
taken 
in 
contract 
administration; 
(13) 
share 
of 
private 
contractors;  (14) 
share 
of 
labor 
based 
construction; 
(1 
5) 
actual axle

labor; 
(1 
8) 
income 
generation; 
and 
(19) 
improvement 
in 
road 
sector/works 
skill 
levels. 
The 
report 
was presented 
and 
discussed 
at 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
launch 
meeting 
on 
March 
14,2003. 
The 
indicators 
would 
be 
revisited 
as 
part 
of  RSDP 
I1 
implementation 
to 
reflect 
the 
broader 
social and 
development 
impact 
of 
the 
proposed 
investments 
including 
outcomes 
associated 
with 
the 
MDGs. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
An 
important 
source 
of 
value added 
by 
Bank 
support 
is 
its 
comparative 
worldwide 
experience 
in 
the 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
major 
capital 
expenditure programs. 
The 
donor 
community 
active 
in 
Ethiopia 
has 
acknowledged 
and 
recognized 
the 
Bank’s 
leadership 
role 
during 
preparation 
of 
the RSDP. 
The 
Bank 
also 
benefits 
from 
the 
experience gained 
in 
implementing 
comprehensive 
road 
sector 
development programs 
with 
institutional 
reforms 
in 
other 
African 
countries. 
Another 
source 
of 
advantage 
is 
the 
Bank’s 
experience 
in 
road 
sector 
reform 
in 
the 
region 
gained over 
the 
last 
ten 
years 
through 
the 
steering 
of 
the 
Road 
Management 
Initiative 
(MI) 
and 
the 
Rural Travel 
and Transport 
Program (RTTP) 
both 
of 
the 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa 
Transport 
Policy 
Program 
(SSATP). 
This 
has 
provided 
the 
Bank 
with 
the 
goodwill 
of 
beneficiaries and 
donors 
in 
creating 
a 
cooperative 
framework 
where 
sector 
reform 
has 
gradually 
been 
shaped, 
implemented 
and monitored. 
The 
APL 
instrument 
has 
been 
confirmed 
- 
35 
- 
Page  42
to 
provide 
greater 
flexibility 
in 
adapting 
project 
design 
and 
financing 
to 
client 
needs 
as 
they 
evolve. 
For 
this, 
the 
Bank 
team 
has 
already gained 
the 
experience 
in 
developing 
transport 
project 
using 
the 
APL 
instrument 
through 
a 
second 
stage 
in 
Uganda. 
The 
Bank’s 
participation 
thus 
provides 
for 
better 
continuity 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
long-term national program 
for 
which 
an 
initial 
support 
is 
under 
implementation. 
A 
review 
of 
the 
social 
aspects 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
Africa 
Region’s transport 
portfolio 
provided 
important 
cross-country experience and 
lessons 
which 
were 
built 
into 
lecture 
and 
field 
training 
to 
create 
awareness 
among 
policy 
makers, 
ERA 
staff, 
local 
social 
scientistdworkers, 
including university 
graduate 
students, 
doctors and 
local 
community 
leaders 
and 
people.

Other (specify) 
The 
economic analysis 
is 
conducted 
for 
civil 
work 
components 
of 
the 
project, constituting 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
project 
financing. 
The 
project 
includes 
a 
number 
of 
investments 
in 
roads 
for 
which 
a 
detailed 
feasibility 
(including 
economic 
justification) 
was 
prepared 
under 
the 
Road 
Rehabilitation 
Project. 
As 
part 
of 
RSDP 
I1 
preparation, economic 
feasibility 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
investments were 
revisited and 
information 
updated 
to 
reflect 
new 
data 
and 
findings. 
The 
analysis 
is 
conducted 
for: 
(a) 
upgrading 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
(1) 
Nazareth-Assela section (79 
km) 
of 
the 
Nazareth-Dodola-Goba 
federal 
trunk 
road; 
(2) 
Woreta-Gob 
Gob 
section (99 
km) 
of 
the 
Woreta-Woldiya 
federal 
major 
link 
road; 
(3) 
Adigrat-Adwa 
section 
(1 
08 
km) 
of 
the 
Adigrat-Shire federal 
road; and 
(4) 
Nekempt-Mekenajo federal 
major 
link 
road 
(127 
km); 
and 
(b) 
the 
construction 
of 
Dera-Magna 
section 
(1 
19 
km) 
of 
the 
Dera-Mechara 
federal 
major 
link 
road 
to 
a 
high 
standard 
gravel 
road. 
Investment 
in 
roads 
were 
subject 
to 
specific 
cost-benefit 
analysis. 
The 
benefit 
stream 
for 
the 
four 
roads 
to 
be 
rehabilitated/ 
upgraded 
consists 
of 
savings 
in 
vehicle operating 
costs 
and travel 
time 
reductions. 
Economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
Dera-Magna federal 
road, 
to 
be 
constructed, 
has 
been 
computed 
using 
the 
producer 
surplus 
approach, 
with 
the 
benefits 
resulting 
from 
increase 
in 
agricultural 
outputs 
(hence 
generated 
traffic). 
The 
cost 
stream comprises 
the 
costs 
to 
the 
road 
agency 
arising 
from 
the 
proposed 
investments, 
net 
of 
incremental 
maintenance 
cost savings. 
The 
analysis 
period 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
20 
years. 
Normal 
traffic 
has 
been 
updated 
to 
take 
account 
of 
Em’s 
2001 classified 
traffic 
count. 
Traffic 
projections 
on 
the 
project 
road 
have taken 
into 
account 
past and 
future trend 
in 
GDP 
growth, 
population 
increase, 
agricultural 
activities, 
tourism, 
AADT, 
vehicle 
fleet 
and 
fuel 
consumption. 
These 
are 
among 
the 
major 
factors 
influencing traffic growth 
rates 
on 
the 
project 
roads. 
The 
HDM 
3 
model 
(in 
HDM 
Manager) 
has 
been 
used 
for 
the 
analysis. 
The 
proposed 
option 
has 
been 
compared 
with 
a 
“do 
minimum” 
case. 
The 
“do 
minimum 
case” 
assumes 
that  a 
minimum 
amount 
of 
maintenance 
of 
the 
existing 
road 
will 
be 
carried 
out. 
The 
economic 
analysis 
is 
based 
on 
benefits 
to 
road 
traffic 
(in 
terms 
of 
savings 
in 
VOCs 
& 
road 
maintenance 
costs) 
compared 
with 
the 
costs 
of 
rehabilitationhpgrading 
and 
maintenance. 
Discounted benefits 
are 
then 
compared 
to 
discounted 
costs 
to 
produce 
measures 
of 
worth. 
Sensitivity 
analysis was 
done 
taking 
into 
account 
three scenarios 
namely 
a 
20% increase 
in 
costs, 
a 20% 
decrease 
in 
benefits 
and the 
worst 
case 
(costs +20% 
& 
benefits 
-20%). 
All 
road 
sections have 
an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
of 
more than 
12%.

Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
fiscal impact 
of 
the 
actual expenditure 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I 
(between 
1997198 
and 
200112) 
and 
the 
projected 
expenditure 
of 
RSDP 
I1 
(2002/03 
to 
2005/6) 
were 
assessed 
during 
appraisal. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
annual revenue 
and 
grants, 
as 
well 
as 
the annual 
capital 
and 
recurrent 
expenditure 
are 
presented 
in 
Annex 
5. 
The 
assessment 
was 
made 
with 
due 
reference 
to 
the overall 
capital 
and 
recurrent 
expenditure 
for 
Ethiopia. 
Data 
on 
Public 
Expenditure 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Economic Development and reconciled 
with 
ERA'S 
and 
Road 
Fund 
data. 
The 
analysis 
shows 
the 
impact of 
the 
actual 
capital 
and 
recurrent 
expenditure 
under 
the RSDP, 
as 
compared 
with 
the other 
health 
and 
education SIPS 
and the 
overall 
expenditure 
over the 
period 
of 
the 
RSDP

Page  44
the 
possible 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
proposed 
road 
expenditure (construction, 
rehabilitation 
and 
maintenance) 
for 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
including 
the 
outstanding expenditure 
from 
RSDP 
I. 
Government 
will 
analyze 
projected 
expenditure 
implications 
annually and 
ascertain whether 
they 
are 
realistic 
in 
the 
context 
of 
public 
expenditure, 
and 
considering possible 
financing 
levels 
and 
sources 
from, 
Government 
revenue, 
the 
Road 
Fund 
and 
donors. 
During 
implementation, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
Government 
will 
review 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
find 
non-priority 
projects 
within 
the 
RSDP 
where 
planned 
expenditures 
could 
be 
reviewed 
as 
appropriate. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
main 
component 
of 
the 
Project 
comprises 
civil 
works 
and 
consultant 
services 
in 
respect 
of 
rehabilitation 
and 
strengthening 
of 
federal 
trunk 
and 
major 
link 
roads 
of 
paved (bitumen) 
standard, 
as 
well 
as 
construction 
of 
new 
sections 
of 
gravel 
surfaced 
regional 
roads, 
upgrading 
of 
low-class 
roads 
classified 
as 
major 
link 
roads 
to 
gravel 
road 
surface standard, 
as 
well 
as 
upgrading 
of 
gravel 
surface 
roads 
to paved 
(bitumen) 
standard. 
ERA 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
consultant 
services 
provided 
under 
Credit 
243 8-ET, 
completed 
economic 
feasibility 
analyses 
and 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
(EIA) 
reports 
for 
the 
roads 
proposed 
for 
consideration 
in 
Stage 
1. 
Consultancy 
services 
for 
detailed 
engineering 
designs 
for 
the 
selected 
roads 
are 
completed and 
the 
engineer's 
estimates 
formed 
the 
basis 
for 
estimating 
project 
costs 
during 
appraisal. 
The 
final 
designs 
are 
based 
on 
Ethiopia 
national 
(and 
other 
comparable 
international) 
road 
design 
standards 
and 
specifications. 
The 
design 
standards 
and specifications 
adopted 
for 
the 
individual road 
sections also take 
into 
account recommendations 
for improving 
road 
safety, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
provisions 
satisfactory 
to 
ERA, 
IDA 
and 
other 
donor 
partners. 
Contract 
documents 
are 
also 
being 
prepared 
under 
the 
same 
consulting 
services, 
and support 
is 
being 
given 
to 
ERA 
for 
the 
pre-qualification 
of 
contractors 
for 
the 
civil 
works 
contracts. 
The project 
costs 
have 
been 
confirmed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
completed detailed 
designs 
and 
engineer's 
estimates 
compared 
with 
available 
cost data 
from 
ongoing 
contracts. 
Construction supervision 
is 
to 
be 
entirely 
carried 
out 
by 
private 
consultants, 
who 
will 
comprise 
association 
of 
international and 
Ethiopian 
firms 
involving 
foreign 
and 
local 
engineers 
and 
technicians, 
as 
has 
been 
the 
practice 
during 
the 
RSDP 
Phase 
I 
implementation. 
Civil 
works 
in 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
APL will 
be 
implemented 
sequentially 
following 
satisfactory 
completion 
and 
acceptance 
of 
the 
results 
of 
economic 
and 
environmental 
feasibility 
analyses, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
resettlement 
action 
plans 
prepared and 
approved 
by 
IDA 
prior 
to 
appraisal 
of 
each 
stage. 
Road 
classification and numbering, 
as 
well 
as 
pavement 
management 
systems 
have 
been 
established 
with 
IDA 
support 
under 
Cr. 
2438-ET. 
The 
systems 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
road network 
administration 
and 
planning, 
as 
well 
as 
assessment 
of 
road 
maintenance 
and other improvement 
needs. 
An 
action 
plan for 
capacity 
building 
and 
the 
development 
and 
promotion 
of 
the 
domestic 
construction 
industry 
was 
presented 
by 
GOE 
as 
part 
of 
proposals 
for 
capacity 
building 
and Private 
Sector development, 
in 
general. 
Elements 
of 
the 
plan 
have been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
Program, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to allow 
the 
increased 
participation 
of 
domestic contractors. 
In 
addition, 
local 
consultants, 
with 
some 
advice 
from 
an 
experienced 
international 
rural 
transport 
consultant have prepared a 
Source 
book 
for rural 
transport 
infrastructure 
and 
services 
development, 
as 
well 
as 
proposals 
for 
pilot 
projects 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
8 
weredas 
for 
infrastructure 
and 
local 
level 
transport 
services 
improvements 
including promotion 
and 
improvement 
of 
intermediate 
means 
of 
transport. 
The 
proposals have 
been 
evaluated 
by 
consultants 
employed 
by 
Ireland 
Aid 
and 
DFID 
and 
discussed 
with 
IDA 
during 
their 
appraisal 
mission 
in 
November 
2002, 
and 
further 
confirmed 
during 
the 
IDA 
appraisal 
mission 
in 
March/April2003. 
Further 
implementation 
in 
the 
pilot 
districts 
will 
provide 
inputs 
for 
refining 
the recommendations 
from 
the 
consultant 
studies.

Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
project 
builds 
on 
existing 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
will 
contribute 
to 
a sustained 
effort 
of 
institutional 
strengthening 
for 
ERA 
and 
Regional 
Roads 
Authorities. 
As 
discussed 
under 
Section 
C.4, 
overall responsibility 
and 
management 
of 
the 
Project 
implementation 
rests 
with 
ERA, 
the 
autonomous 
Road 
Agency, 
with 
oversight 
provided 
by 
its 
Board. 
ERA’S 
program 
coordination, contract 
management 
and administration 
capacity, 
as 
well 
as 
transport economics 
and 
planning 
were 
greatly 
enhanced 
by 
donor-supported 
TA 
during 
RSDP 
Phase 
1. 
This 
was 
augmented 
by 
GOE’s 
commitment 
to 
contract 
administration 
capacity 
building 
in 
recruiting 
contract 
administration 
staff 
and 
through 
Bank 
and other 
donor-funded 
formal 
training 
and training-through-doing. 
In 
addition, 
ERA 
adopted 
and implemented 
the 
ERA 
Reform 
Study 
findings 
including 
the 
implementation 
of 
uniform 
contract 
reporting 
and 
monitoring 
system. 
ERA’S 
Contract 
Administration 
Division 
is 
responsible 
for 
processing 
and 
managing 
all 
construction and 
supervision consultancy 
contracts, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
consultancy 
services 
for 
the 
various 
studies. 
However, 
with 
the 
start 
of 
the 
RSDP 
Phase 
2 
activities, 
further 
support 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
enable 
ERA 
to 
handle 
the 
increased 
activities 
in: 
procurement, contract 
administration, design 
review 
and 
approval, 
adverse 
social 
impact 
mitigation 
and avoidance 
of 
claims. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Project 
management 
is 
to 
be 
coordinated 
by 
ERA 
senior core staff, together 
with 
staff 
of 
RRAs. 
TA 
has 
technically 
supported 
ERA 
and 
the 
RRAs 
for 
the 
management 
of 
RSDP 
Phase 
1. 
Roads Inspectorate 
Office, 
which 
was 
established 
within 
ERA, 
has 
carried 
out 
independent 
program 
implementation 
performance 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
Additional 
TA 
is 
being 
provided 
under 
APL 
1 
to 
support 
ERA 
in 
its 
increased 
load 
of 
procurement, 
design 
review 
and contract 
administration 
and 
management 
expected 
under 
Phase 
2. 
In 
addition, 
ERA’s 
financial 
management 
capacity 
was 
strengthened 
with 
support 
from 
IDA, 
and 
ERA’s 
entity 
accounts 
have therefore 
been 
brought 
up 
to 
date. 
All 
project 
and 
entity 
audit reports 
are 
now 
up 
to 
date 
for 
the 
FY 
2002. 
Project 
management 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
ERA 
with 
whom 
a 
separate 
Project 
Agreement 
will 
be 
signed. 
Procurement Management 
Systems 
were 
reviewed 
during 
project 
appraisal 
and 
action 
plans 
developed 
to 
ensure 
that the 
ERA 
and 
its 
associated agencies 
in 
the 
Regions 
will 
operate 
efficiently. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
ERA 
Contract 
Administration 
Division 
has 
shown 
sufficient 
capacity 
for 
procurement 
processing. 
A 
Country 
Procurement 
assessment 
review 
was 
completed 
and 
draft report 
submitted 
to 
GOE 
in 
June 2002. 
The 
CPAR 
is 
used 
to provide 
a 
firm 
basis 
for 
determining 
existing 
ERA 
capacity and any 
additional 
support 
needs. 
In 
order 
to 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
monitoring 
the 
procurement activities, 
ERA 
has 
prepared 
a 
procurement 
plan 
incorporating 
the 
detailed 
engineering 
design 
and contract 
administration 
activities 
continued 
from 
Cr. 
2438-ET, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
components 
under 
Stage 
1. 
This 
provided 
an 
additional 
basis 
for 
selection 
of 
components 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
the 
subsequent 
stages 
of 
the RSDSP 
II- 
APL 
3-4. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
Bank’s 
policy 
(OP 10.02) 
requires 
recipients and 
project 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
maintain 
financial 
management 
systems, 
including 
accounting, 
financial 
reporting and auditing 
systems, 
adequate 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
can 
provide 
to 
the 
Bank 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
regarding project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
The 
assessment 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
this 
project 
was done 
in 
line 
with 
the 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Sector 
Board 
in 
June 
2001. 
ERA 
has 
a 
Finance and 
Administrative 
Department staffed 
with 
adequate 
and appropriately 
qualified 
- 
39 
- 
Page  46
staff. 
The Project 
Finance Section 
in 
the 
department 
handles 
all 
project related 
transactions. 
Staff 
working 
in 
the section 
have 
very 
good 
experience 
and 
understanding and 
are 
capable 
of 
handling project 
financial 
transactions 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA’S 
disbursement 
guidelines 
and 
procedures. 
In 
the 
past 
four 
years, 
there 
has 
been 
a substantial 
improvement 
in 
the 
finance 
division 
of 
ERA 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
qualified 
manpower and 
quality 
of 
the annual 
financial 
reports. 
The 
backlogs 
in 
the 
submission 
of 
entity 
audit 
reports, 
which 
existed 
at the 
start 
of 
RSDP 
I 
have 
been cleared 
and 
currently 
ERA 
is 
up-to-date 
in 
closing 
the 
accounts 
and 
submitting 
the 
entity 
audit 
reports. 
The qualification 
points 
on 
the 
annual audit reports 
have also 
been reduced 
substantially 
in 
the 
last couple 
of 
years. 
The 
main 
qualification points 
mentioned 
in 
the 
last 
couple 
of 
years 
were 
long 
outstanding 
balances 
in 
goods-in-transit, 
debtors, 
creditors and 
cash 
at 
Bank 
accounts. 
IDA, 
through 
RRP 
Credit 
no. 2438-ET, 
provided 
TA 
support 
to 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
ERA. 
In 
this 
TA, 
the 
Organizational 
Structure 
of 
the 
Finance 
Division 
was 
clearly 
defined 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Management 
of 
ERA, 
chart 
of 
accounts was 
designed 
and 
are 
being 
implemented, 
long 
outstanding 
balances 
in 
bank, 
debtors 
and creditors 
accounts cleared, 
other related 
activities 
are 
done, 
and 
the 
computerization 
process 
is 
underway 
with 
support 
of 
TA 
financed 
by 
GTZ 
and 
DFID. 
With 
the 
GTZ 
support, 
the 
ACCPAC 
accounting 
software 
is 
currently 
being 
installed 
in 
the 
Head 
Office 
of 
ERA. 
Employees 
are 
taking 
training 
on 
the 
use 
of 
the 
ACCPAC 
software 
and 
it 
is 
intended 
to 
close 
the 
accounts 
of 
ERA 
using 
the 
ACCPAC 
software 
for 
the 
year 
to 
be 
ended 
7 
July 
2003. 
With 
the 
Support 
of 
DFID, 
the 
ACCPAC 
accounting 
software 
has 
been 
already 
installed 
in 
the 
district 
offices 
of 
ERA 
and 
training 
is 
underway 
to 
equip 
employees 
with 
the 
software. 
Other 
tasks 
may 
need 
additional financing 
from 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
depending 
on 
the 
scope 
and 
progress 
of 
the 
GTZ 
and 
DFID

in 
implementing 
the 
following 
activities:

Some 
of 
the 
resources 
from RSDP 
I1 
will 
be 
required 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
ERA 
are 
further 
strengthened 
in 
terms 
of 
quality 
of 
reports 
and 
adequately 
trained 
manpower. 
The 
resource, 
when confirmed 
with 
the 
cooperating 
donors, 
will 
be 
used 
to 
complete 
the 
already 
started 
computerization 
process 
by 
acquiring additional 
hardware 
and, 
if 
necessary, 
additional 
software, and 
training 
of 
staff 
to 
use 
the 
systems. 
ERA 
is 
implementing 
a 
program 
of 
commercialization 
of 
its 
district 
maintenance 
office 
activities 
with 
DFID 
support. 
The 
existing 
financial 
management 
systems 
would 
therefore 
need 
to 
be 
changed 
to 
accommodate 
the 
commercialization 
activities 
at 
the 
district 
levels. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
additional 
trained 
staff 
would 
be 
required 
and 
the 
systems 
would 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
to 
accommodate 
producing 
of 
profit 
and 
loss 
accounts 
for 
the 
districts. Associated 
with 
this 
is 
the 
decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting 
activities 
at 
the 
district 
levels. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
decentralization 
of 
the accounting 
activities 
at 
the 
district level 
will 
start 
on 
July 
8,2003 
when 
DMOs 
will 
become 
cost centers. 
They 
are 
also 
programmed 
to 
become 
profit 
centers 
by 
July 
2005, 
and 
commercial 
entities 
by 
July 
2006. 
Decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting activities 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
less 
problematic 
than 
the 
commercialization 
process 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
decentralization 
of 
accounting activities 
need 
only 
additional 
staff 
to 
use 
the 
existing 
systems, whereas 
the 
commercialization 
would 
require 
a 
change 
of 
systems.

Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation and 
disclosure) and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
potential 
negative impacts 
include: 
soil 
erosion, 
temporary 
loss 
of 
strips 
farmland along 
the 
road 
alignment, disturbances 
in 
the 
water 
quality, 
noise and 
dust 
are 
presumed 
to 
induce 
adverse 
physical 
environmental impacts 
during 
road 
construction work. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
resettling 
and 
compensation 
of 
the 
affected 
people, 
five 
individual 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plans have 
been 
prepared 
and 
approved. 
The

Under 
RSDP 
I, 
the 
recipient 
has 
laid 
the 
foundation 
for 
sound 
environmental and social 
management 
within 
the 
roads sector 
in 
Ethiopia. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I 
EA 
recommendations, 
an 
environmental 
monitoring 
branch 
(EMB) 
was 
established 
under 
the 
ERA. 
It 
consists 
of 
an 
ecologist, 
a 
sociologist 
and 
an 
engineer. 
The 
EMB 
has 
been 
mainly 
engaged 
in 
reviewing 
environmental 
assessments 
reports 
prepared 
by 
design 
and 
EA 
consultants. 
Environmental 
monitoring 
activities 
are 
also 
being 
undertaken 
by 
the 
EMB. 
EMB 
operations 
are 
supported 
by 
an 
Environmental 
Procedures 
Manual 
and 
a 
Resettlement/Rehabilitation 
Policy 
Framework 
prepared 
under 
RSDP 
I. 
Both 
documents have been 
reviewed 
and 
cleared 
by 
ASPEN. 
In 
year 
2003, 
the 
EMB 
changed 
its 
name 
in 
order 
to 
include 
safety 
issues 
in 
its 
functions. 
The 
Branch 
is 
now 
called, 
the 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
and Safety 
Branch 
(EMSB). 
Individual 
Environmental 
Assessments 
(EA) 
including 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
Plans 
(EMPs) 
for 
the 
first 
year's 
road 
program 
(5 
roads) 
have 
been 
prepared.  These 
have 
been 
approved 
and 
cleared 
by 
ASPEN 
and disclosed 
in 
Ethiopia 
as 
well 
as 
at 
the 
Infoshop. 
Likewise, 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plans 
(RAP) 
for 
the 
first 
year's 
road 
program 
have 
been 
prepared, 
approved and 
cleared 
by 
ASTEN 
and 
the 
same 
were 
disclosed 
in 
Ethiopia 
and 
at 
Infoshop 
prior to 
project 
appraisal. 
RSDP 
I1 
will 
continue 
to 
support 
EMSB 
to 
implement 
EMPs 
and 
RAPs 
prepared 
for 
each 
of 
the 
proposed 
road 
projects. 
The 
program 
will 
also 
strengthen 
the 
analytical and 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
unit 
through 
training 
and 
logistical 
support. 
The mitigation 
of 
adverse 
environmental 
and 
social impacts 
identified 
will 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
credit 
agreement. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
EMPs 
and 
the 
RAPs 
will 
be 
launched 
prior 
to 
commencement 
of 
civil 
works. 
Supervision 
of 
project 
operations 
will 
include 
a 
social 
scientist 
and environment 
specialists. 
Project 
progress 
reports 
shall 
include 
environmental 
and 
social development 
outcomes.

proposed sub-projects 
to 
be 
considered 
under 
RSDP 
II. 
The 
total road 
length 
is 
approximately 
2, 
250 
km. 
The 
preparation 
of 
Phase 
I1 
activities 
will 
integrate 
these 
findings 
on 
the 
selection, 
design 
and 
mitigation 
of 
the 
sub-projects. 
EMPs 
for 
each 
of 
the 
sub-projects 
have 
been 
prepared 
and 
will 
be 
implemented 
and monitored. 
In 
addition, 
RSDP 
I1 
will 
not 
only 
conduct actions 
ensuring 
environmental 
safeguards, 
but 
also 
undertake 
proactive environmental 
actions 
to 
enhance 
protection 
of 
the 
road infrastructure 
from 
floods, 
soil 
erosion 
and 
silt 
caused 
by 
environmental degradation 
in 
the 
catchments 
areas 
along 
the 
road 
alignments. 
Progressively, 
the 
EMSB 
has 
been 
engaged 
in: 
reviewing 
EA 
reports prepared 
by 
design 
and 
EA 
consultants; 
monitoring 
all 
IDA 
sub-project operations and 
providing 
support 
to 
other 
donor financed 
programs 
in 
the 
mitigation 
of 
adverse 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts. 
Also, 
the 
EMSB 
has 
been 
responsible 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Procedures 
Manual 
and 
the 
Resettlement/Rehabilitation 
Policy 
Framework. 
Furthermore, 
the 
EMSB 
prepared 
an 
HIV/AIDS 
strategy 
framework 
for 
the 
road 
sector. 
The 
three 
documents 
are 
finalized, 
they 
are 
being 
used 
in 
ERA'S 
project 
preparations 
and 
will 
be instrumental 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
RSDP 
11. 
Support 
to 
the 
EMSB 
will 
continue 
under 
RSDP 
11, 
in 
the 
aim 
to; 
a) 
strengthen 
the 
analytical 
capacity 
of 
the 
unit; 
b) 
strengthen 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
unit 
through 
training 
and 
logistical 
support and 
c) 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
EMPs 
prepared 
for 
each 
of 
the 
proposed 
road 
projects

How 
have stakeholders 
been consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts 
and 
proposed environment 
management 
plan? 
Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups were consulted? 
Public 
consultations 
were 
held 
throughout 
the 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
(EIA) 
and social impact 
assessment 
(SIA) 
processes 
in 
communities 
along 
the 
corridors 
of 
roads 
selected 
for 
design 
and 
inclusion 
in 
the 
program 
. 
The 
stakeholders 
included: 
local 
governments 
and 
administrations, 
community 
based 
organizations 
(CBOs), 
community 
based 
facilitators 
(CBFs), 
NGOs, regional 
governments, 
sectoral 
administrations 
and 
federal 
authorities. 
The 
consultations 
focused 
on 
assessing 
the 
viability 
of 
the 
project, 
identifying 
potential 
areas 
of 
conflict 
between 
stakeholders and 
define 
areas 
of 
collaboration. 
The 
social 
assessment 
training 
provided 
in 
February-March 
2003 
for 
the 
ERA 
and 
key 
stakeholders 
focused 
on 
the 
consultative 
and 
participatory 
techniques 
to 
be 
further 
employed throughout 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project.

What 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Environmental 
monitoring 
activities 
are 
being 
undertaken 
by 
the 
EMSB.

supported 
by 
the 
completed 
Environmental 
Procedures 
Manual 
and 
the 
Resettlement/Rehabilitation 
Policy 
Framework. 
The 
EMSB 
will 
produce progress 
reports 
to 
monitor 
environmental 
and 
social 
performance. 
The 
reports 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
overall project 
monitoring 
system. 
RSDP 
I1 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
continue 
to 
support 
EMSB 
to 
monitor EMPs 
prepared 
for 
each 
of 
the 
proposed 
road 
projects 
as 
well 
to 
strengthen 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
unit 
through 
training 
and 
logistical 
support. 
Transport 
- 
Poverty 
Observatories 
focusing 
on 
environmental 
and social indicators, 
will 
be 
established 
on 
each 
road 
alignment 
at 
local 
community 
level 
to 
monitor 
environmental 
and 
social 
impact 
in 
identified 
outcome

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and 
specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
To 
help 
the 
project 
strengthen 
its 
effectiveness 
in 
reaching the 
poor 
and 
the 
most vulnerable 
groups 
and 
achieve 
its 
planned 
development 
outcomes, 
the 
following 
social 
actions 
have 
been 
undertaken. 
A 
social 
impact 
assessment 
(SIA) 
was 
conducted 
by 
the government 
for 
each 
of 
the 
seven roads, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Environmental Impact 
Assessment 
(EIA). 
The 
EIA 
team 
included 
both 
social 
scientists 
and environmentalists. 
The 
socioeconomic 
data 
collected through 
review 
of 
existing 
documentation and 
public 
consultations, 
covered 
issues 
related 
to 
land 
acquisition, 
involuntary 
resettlement, 
road 
safety and 
HIVIAIDS, 
vulnerable 
groups, 
indigenous 
peoples 
and 
cultural 
property. 
The 
SIA 
concluded 
that 
project 
operations 
will 
have 
adverse 
social 
impacts 
induced 
by: 
a) 
land 
acquisition 
resulting 
in 
involuntary 
resettlement 
and 
b) 
dislocation 
of 
social 
values 
resulting 
in 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS. 
1763 households 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
involuntarily 
displaced 
by 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
5 
roads, 
i.e., 
about 
350 project 
affected 
persons (PAPs) 
per 
road. 
The 
ERA 
has 
existing 
resettlement 
/rehabilitation 
procedures 
(in 
the 
Resettlement 
Framework 
and 
in 
the 
Environmental 
Procedure Manual), 
providing 
guidance 
in 
the 
mitigation 
of 
adverse 
social 
impacts. 
The 
two 
documents 
have 
been 
approved 
by 
the Federal Government 
of 
Ethiopia 
and 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plans 
(RAP),  have 
been prepared and 
disclosed 
for 
sub-projects 
with 
or 
above 
200 
PAPS 
prior 
to 
appraisal. 
Drawing 
from 
lessons 
learned 
in 
RSDP 
I, 
RSDP 
I1 
will 
initiate 
pro-active social 
actions 
in 
terms 
of 
Accompanying 
Social 
Measures 
(ASM) 
that 
is, 
being 
formulated 
in 
a 
Social 
Action 
Program 
for 
RSDP 
11. 
The 
focus 
of 
the 
program 
is 
twofold: 
a) 
strengthening 
of 
capacity 
in 
social 
analysis, 
e.g., 
in 
Regional 
Road Authorities 
after 
a 
needs 
assessment 
and 
b) 
increasing the 
inclusion 
of 
social 
issues 
into 
road 
project 
designs. 
For 
instance, 
as 
part 
of 
RSDP 
I1 
(APL) 
preparation, a 
corridor 
development 
study 
financed 
by 
the 
Japanese 
PHRD 
fund 
is 
to 
be 
carried 
out. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
study 
is 
to 
identify 
and 
include 
into 
the 
road 
design, 
social 
issues 
of 
concern 
for 
the 
local 
communities 
along 
the 
road 
alignment; 
e.g. 
subjects such 
as 
local 
master plans, 
buss 
stops 
and 
market 
places, 
access 
to 
health 
services 
and 
schools. 
The 
expected 
social 
outcome 
of 
the 
study 
is 
to 
better 
serve 
local 
populations 
along 
the 
road 
alignment. 
Enforcement 
of 
social 
clauses 
in 
contracts 
will 
be 
enhanced 
by: 
a) 
strengthening 
ERA's 
analytical 
capacity 
to 
undertake 
social 
analysis and 
review 
outputs; 
b) 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
ERA's 
right-of-way 
agents 
to 
follow 
up 
on 
implementation 
of 
resettlement 
action 
plans, 
including 
the 
compensation payments 
to 
PAPs, and addressing 
ROW 
related 
issues; 
c) 
developing 
a 
practical 
procedures 
manual 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
right-of-way 
issues 
and 
c) 
improving 
the 
monitoring 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
relevant 
safeguard 
issues 
and social 
clauses 
of 
contracts. 
6.2 
Participatory Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
-43- 
Page  50
The 
design 
of 
the 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
(RSDP) 
is 
participatory 
at 
several 
levels. 
The 
SIA 
included 
consultations 
with 
stakeholders; 
local 
governments 
and 
administrations,  CBOs, 
NGOs, 
regional 
governments, 
sectoral 
administrations 
and 
federal 
authorities, 
the 
association 
of 
local 
contractors 
to 
ensure 
the 
full 
participation 
of 
the 
primary 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
final 
design 
of 
the program. Also, 
the 
consultations 
involved 
local 
communities, farmers 
groups, 
other 
nonprofit 
service 
providers, 
SMEs 
and 
informal 
sector, 
and 
focused 
on 
assessing 
the 
viability 
of 
the 
project, 
identifying 
potential 
areas 
of 
conflict 
between 
stakeholders 
and 
defined 
potential 
areas 
of 
collaboration. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
public 
consultations 
carried out 
in 
the 
SIA 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
EL4 
and 
ERA’S 
additional 
consultations, 
among 
others 
documented 
on 
video-films, 
confirm 
a 
solid 
support 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
Both 
local 
governments, 
civil 
society, 
e.g., 
the 
Fistula 
Hospital, 
NGOs, 
CBOs, 
CBFs and vulnerable 
groups 
such 
as 
women, 
youth, 
the 
handicap 
and 
the 
elderly 
are 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
project. 
To 
further 
improve 
stakeholders 
participation, the 
following 
actions 
are 
proposed: 
(i) 
within 
ERA, 
the 
creation 
of 
coordination 
committees 
that 
will 
include 
private, 
informal 
and 
public 
organizations 
representatives; 
(ii) 
conduct 
of 
training 
activities 
to 
increase 
awareness 
of 
relevant 
issues 
and 
actions 
and 
to 
introduce 
the 
culture 
of 
continuous 
public 
consultation and 
feedback 
in 
the 
planning, 
development, 
maintenance 
and operation 
of 
the 
road 
and 
transport 
network; 
(iii) 
increased 
consultation 
of 
project 
stakeholders, 
local 
governments, 
local 
communities and 
project 
affected 
persons 
(PAPS) 
along 
the 
road 
alignment 
during 
the 
APL 
1 
implementation and 
the 
various 
stages 
of 
the 
project cycle 
to 
improve 
the 
planning 
and 
design 
proposals 
for 
APL 
2 
- 
4. 
The 
consultations 
will 
provide 
the 
opportunity 
for 
the 
stakeholders 
(particularly 
rural 
stakeholders) 
to 
express 
their 
concerns 
and 
provide 
suggestions 
through 
public 
hearings 
and 
informatiodsensitization 
campaigns 
and 
to 
ensure 
that peoples’ 
needs 
have 
been 
taken 
into 
account. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Local 
governments’ 
participation 
has 
been requested 
at 
the design 
level 
to 
provide 
inputs 
to 
road 
alignments and at 
implementation 
level, 
to 
facilitate: 
a) 
the 
mitigation 
of 
social and environmental 
impacts; 
b) 
the 
construction 
of 
camps 
and 
administrative 
services. 
CBOs, 
CBFs 
and 
NGOs 
are 
expected 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
design 
and implementation 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
information 
and prevention 
campaigns. 
Sectoral 
and Federal administrations 
and 
authorities 
will 
coordinate 
all 
project 
operations, 
facilitate 
enforcement 
of 
regulations and 
cany 
out 
monitoring. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
site 
specific 
social 
analysis 
and 
the 
implementation of 
mitigation 
measures, 
will 
include 
the 
participation 
of 
CBOs, CBFs, 
NGOs, 
private 
and 
informal 
sectors, 
and 
local 
administrations. 
The 
aim 
will 
be 
to 
ensure 
that 
participation 
of 
such 
stakeholders 
is 
not only 
limited 
to 
preparation 
of 
the 
road 
design, 
but 
that 
it 
also 
includes 
their 
implementation. 
Social 
Contract:  One 
option 
to 
be 
pursued 
during 
project implementation 
would 
be 
to 
look 
at 
the 
possibility 
of 
initiating 
“Social 
Contracts” 
with 
local 
communities, 
especially 
regarding 
road 
safety 
and 
road 
maintenance 
activities. 
To 
increase 
communities’ ownership 
of, 
and 
commitment 
to 
the 
project 
objectives and 
ensure 
sustainability, communities 
would 
be 
provided 
space 
to participate 
in; 
a) 
safeguarding 
the 
road 
from 
right 
of 
way 
encroachment 
and 
b) 
maintaining 
agreed sections 
of 
the 
road. 
For 
the 
delivery 
of 
these 
services, 
participating 
local 
communities 
would 
be 
remunerated. 
Social 
contracts 
of 
the 
kind 
proposed 
would 
not 
only 
provide 
a continuous dialogue 
with 
local 
stakeholders, 
but 
also 
strengthen 
ownership 
and 
sustainability 
of 
the 
road 
services 
provided. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes?

Page  51
The 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
and 
Safety 
Branch (EMSB) 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
mitigation 
of 
adverse 
social impacts 
are 
effected 
by 
the 
contractors and 
the 
consultant 
engineers. 
Among 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
EMSB, 
is 
one 
social 
scientist. 
A 
second 
social 
scientist 
has 
been 
added 
to 
the 
team 
to 
focus 
on 
HIVIAIDS 
issues. 
The 
EMSB 
will 
continue 
designing 
the mechanisms 
for 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
the 
social 
mitigation 
measures. 
Monitoring 
and evaluation 
will 
also 
be 
carried 
by 
independent entities 
(including 
selecting 
from 
the 
local 
social 
scientists that 
have participated 
in 
the 
social 
analysis 
training) 
at 
different 
stages 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
social 
mitigation 
measures. 
The Right-of-way 
Branch 
has 
been 
merged 
with 
the 
Contract 
Administration 
Division 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
service 
delivery 
to 
PAPS, 
to 
contractors 
and 
enhance 
communication 
regarding 
right-of-way 
issues 
between 
the 
contract 
division 
and 
the 
contractors. 
Local 
social 
scientists 
and/or 
environmentalists 
will 
be 
recruited 
to 
become 
part 
of 
the 
consultant 
engineer 
team 
to 
ensure 
quality 
and 
compliance 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
social and environmental 
clauses 
of 
the 
contracts, 
including 
accompanying 
actions. 
As 
a 
follow-up 
to 
a 
recently completed 
ESW 
review 
of 
povertylsocial 
issues 
in 
the 
Africa 
Region 
Transport 
portfolio, 
AFTTR 
and 
AFTES 
have 
initiated 
a 
series 
of 
regional 
capacity 
building 
workshops 
for 
local 
social 
scientists, 
key 
government 
agencies 
and transport authorities, 
in 
the 
aim 
to 
better 
address 
social 
issues 
in 
their 
project/program 
operations. 
The 
Ethiopia 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
was 
selected 
for 
the 
first 
regional 
training 
which 
took 
place 
in 
Addis-Ababa 
from 
mid-February 
to 
mid-March 
2003. 
The 
overall 
objective 
of 
the 
training 
was 
to: 
(1) 
create awareness 
among transport 
authorities 
about 
the 
range and 
importance 
of 
poverty/social 
issues; 
(2) 
strengthen 
social 
analysis 
capacity 
of 
road 
transport 
stakeholders, 
e.g., 
members 
of 
the

road 
authorities, and 
relevant 
Federal 
Agencies, 
e.g., 
the 
Ethiopian Environmental

help 
create 
a constituency 
of 
advocates 
for 
these 
key 
issues 
among 
policy 
makers, 
transport authorities, donors 
and 
civil 
society. 
In 
the 
process 
of 
preparing 
the 
Ethiopian 
Rural 
Transport and 
Road 
Program 
(ERTTP),  a study 
on 
how 
to 
assist 
women 
to 
make 
better 
use 
of 
IMTs 
was 
prepared 
and 
a 
workshop 
on 
gender 
and 
rural 
transport 
was 
organized 
for the 
ERA 
staff involved 
in 
rural 
roads. 
Both 
activities 
were 
funded 
under 
the 
Gender 
and 
Rural 
Transport 
Initiative 
(GRTI) 
of 
the 
Africa 
RTTP. 
GRTI 
is 
also 
funding 
a 
pilot 
implementation 
of 
some 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
study 
and 
lessons 
learned 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
ERTTP 
operations.

How will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
RSDP 
I1 
will 
have a strong focus 
on 
monitoring 
and evaluation. 
Social/poverty 
development 
outcomes 
matrix 
has 
been 
designed 
which 
will 
be 
refined 
and 
monitored 
along 
other indicators 
and 
throughout 
the 
APL 
1 
and 
subsequent 
APL 
2-4 
project 
cycles 
by 
the 
EMSB 
and 
ERA’S 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
unit. 
Social 
clauses 
including 
HIV/AIDS 
will 
be 
included 
in 
contract 
documents. 
Together 
with 
the 
other 
main 
donors 
(EC 
and 
AfDB) 
of 
the 
program, 
RSDP 
11 
has 
developed 
road

indicators integrated 
with 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
(MDGs).

in 
terms 
of

The 
effort 
to 
evaluate 
the 
"before" and "after" 
impact 
of 
the 
roads 
will 
include 
setting 
up

will 
be 
executed

with 
local

Describe 
provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
An 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
and 
Safety 
Branch (EMSB) 
was 
set 
up 
at 
ERA 
under 
RSDP 
I, 
to 
ensure 
supervision 
and 
monitoring 
of 
environmental 
and 
social 
mitigation 
measures 
in 
compliance 
with 
Bank's 
safeguard 
requirements. 
Bank 
supervision 
of 
project 
operations 
will 
include 
both 
environmentalists and 
social 
scientists 
to 
ensure 
continuity, quality 
and 
sustainability. 
A 
road 
sector 
EM 
was 
prepared 
for 
ERA 
under 
RSDP 
I. 
Seven 
road 
specific 
EIAs 
were 
jointly 
prepared 
by 
environmentalists 
and 
social 
scientists. 
Additional 
studies 
will 
be 
undertaken 
to 
enhance 
project 
design 
and 
minimize 
adverse 
impacts 
during 
implementation, 
these 
studies 
include: 
a) 
the 
establishment 
of 
road 
corridor 
development 
plans 
incorporating 
into 
road 
design, 
the 
physical 
master 
plans 
of 
local 
community 
centers 
along 
the 
road 
alignment; 
b) 
an assessment 
of 
road 
poverty/social 
impacts 
of 
transport 
operations. 
Based 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
EIA, 
five 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plans (RAPs) have 
been 
prepared 
to mitigate 
adverse 
social 
impacts 
identified 
in 
the 
EIA. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
resettling 
and 
compensation 
of 
the 
affected 
people, 
five 
individual 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plans 
have 
been 
prepared 
and 
approved. The number 
of 
households 
affected 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
Total 
number 
of 
households 
affected by 
resettlement 
and/or 
compensation: 
Of 
the 
1,763, 
a 
total 
number 
of 
households 
which 
will 
be 
resettled 
and 
on 
their 
own 
land 
or 
will 
otherwise 
be 
affected 
in 
any 
way: 
Of 
the 1,763, a 
total 
number 
of

which 
will 
be 
resettled 
on

other 
than 
their 
own: 
1,763 
1,536

An 
environmental 
procedures 
manual (EPM) 
has 
been 
prepared and 
a Resettlement/ 
Rehabilitation 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
establishing 
principles 
for 
compensation and 
rehabilitation 
have 
been 
completed, 
approved 
by 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government 
and endorsed 
by 
the 
Bank. 
The 
Resettlement/Rehabilitation 
Policy 
Framework 
and 
the 
five 
RAPs 
were disclosed 
prior 
to 
appraisal. 
Right 
of 
way 
requirements have 
been 
revised 
in 
the 
project 
design 
phase 
and 
will 
be 
revisited 
during 
project 
implementation 
to 
reduce 
land 
acquisition and 
involuntary 
resettlement, 
where 
safety 
is 
not 
compromised. Social 
clauses 
including 
HIV/AIDS 
awareness 
and prevention 
operations, 
as 
well 
as 
road 
safety 
awareness 
will 
be incorporated 
into 
the

will 
be 
refined 
for 
each

Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The critical 
factor 
required 
for 
sustainability 
of 
the 
program 
and 
project 
benefits 
is 
continued 
Government 
commitment 
at 
the 
highest 
level 
to 
sector 
and 
institutional reform. 
Strengthening the 
institutional 
and organizational 
capacity 
of 
road 
agencies 
is 
essential 
for 
sustainable 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP 
and 
the up-keep 
of 
the 
road 
network. 
In 
addition, 
without 
fostering 
local 
contracting capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation 
works, 
the 
country 
will 
continue 
to 
face 
capacity 
constraints 
to 
execute 
road 
program. 
Without 
greater resource 
mobilization, 
Government 
will 
continue 
to 
face 
budgetary 
constraints 
in 
funding 
the 
required 
level 
of 
maintenance.

Detailed Project Description 
ETHIOPIA: 
ROAD 
SECTOR 
DEVELOPMENT 
PHASE 
I 
PROJECT 
GOE 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
and 
the 
Proposed 
Support 
The 
Government 
has attached a 
high 
priority to 
the 
Road 
sector 
in 
its 
overall 
economic 
development 
program 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
In 
1997, a 
major 
ten 
year 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
(RSDP) was 
launched 
in 
order 
to 
address 
the 
limited 
coverage 
and 
poor 
state 
of 
the 
road 
network, 
as 
well 
as, 
the 
growing 
transport 
requirements 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
Program 
was 
launched 
with 
a 
very 
significant 
donor 
support 
to 
create adequate 
capacity 
in 
the 
road 
sector, 
and 
to 
facilitate 
the 
economic 
recovery 
process 
through 
the restoration 
of 
essential 
road 
network. 
With 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
June 2002, 
the 
GOE 
embarked 
on 
the 
RSDP 
11. 
The 
program aimed 
at 
the 
further 
development 
of 
a 
strong 
management 
and technical 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
road network, 
in 
order 
to 
address 
key 
outstanding 
sectoral 
issues, 
along 
with 
the 
development 
of 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
domestic 
construction 
industry. 
The 
investments 
under 
the 
program 
will 
continue 
to 
restore 
and 
expand 
the 
road 
network, 
to 
improve 
access 
of 
rural 
communities 
to 
markets, 
off 
farm 
economic opportunities, 
and social 
services 
and 
facilities, 
which 
are 
still 
the 
major 
obstacles 
and 
impediments 
for 
a sustainable 
economic 
development. 
The 
RSDP 
11, 
estimated 
to 
cost 
about 
USD 
1.48 
billion, 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
financed 
in 
parallel 
by 
IDA, 
EC, 
AfDB, 
NDF, 
BADEA, 
OPEC 
Fund, 
Japan, 
Germany, 
Italy, 
Ireland, 
UK, 
Sweden, 
Several 
NGOs, 
Road 
Fund, 
Beneficiary 
Communities 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia. 
The 
target 
is, 
by 
2007, 
(i) 
to 
have 
45% 
of 
the 
roads 
in 
good 
condition 
from 
the 
current 
condition 
of 
30%, 
(ii) 
to 
install 
regular 
maintenance 
on 
the 
Ethiopian road 
network, 
(iii) 
to 
increase 
the 
road 
density 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
from 
30 
(the 
current 
Figure) 
to 
35 
by 
June 2007. 
The 
Government 
presented 
to 
IDA 
its 
proposal 
for 
IDA 
assistance 
over 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
period 
which 
is 
to 
be 
implemented 
through 
an 
APL 
instrument 
in 
four 
phases. 
The 
total 
cost 
of 
the 
proposed 
activities 
is 
US 
$ 
863.63 
million, 
out 
of 
which GOE 
has 
requested 
IDA 
financing 
support 
of 
US 
$570.30 
million. 
The 
support 
would 
cover 
primarily 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
upgrading 
of 
priority 
Federal 
Roads, 
rehabilitation 
and 
construction 
of 
priority 
Federal 
Link 
and 
Regional 
Roads, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport 
Program, 
along 
with 
the 
required 
TA 
support 
to 
ERA 
and 
the 
regional 
road 
authorities. 
Road Sector Development Support Program 
II 
- 
APL 
I 
The 
primary 
objective 
of 
the 
Road 
Program 
is 
to 
restore and 
expand 
Ethiopia’s 
road 
network 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
and 
increase 
employment through 
promoting 
growth 
and 
access 
in 
a 
socially 
and 
environmentally 
sustainable 
manner. 
The 
Program 
(APL) 
would 
support 
GOE’s 
Agriculture-Development 
Led 
Industrialization 
(ADLI) 
and 
Sustainable 
Development and 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Program 
(SDPRP) 
with 
the 
objective 
to realizing 
the 
MDGs 
and 
contributing 
to 
government’s 
decentralization 
efforts. 
GOE 
has 
submitted 
a 
proposal 
to 
IDA 
for 
implementation 
under 
RSDSP 
I1 
APLl 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
USD 
2 19.27 
million. 
However, 
the 
proposed 
IDA 
share 
of 
financing 
for 
the 
APL 
1 
amounts 
to 
USD 
126.80 
million. 
The 
phasing 
of 
the 
APL 
has 
been 
developed 
for 
implementation 
in 
four 
stages. 
The 
subsequent 
stages 
will 
overlap 
with 
the 
previous 
one 
over 
an 
overall program implementation 
period 
of 
10 years 
(2003-2013).

Rehabilitation 
and 
upmading 
of 
Federal 
Trunk 
and 
Link 
Roads 
The 
road 
sections 
to 
be 
financed 
in 
APL1, 
all form 
part 
of 
four 
roads proposed 
initially 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
upgrading 
under 
APLI 
and 
11. 
The 
feasibility 
studies, 
environmental 
impact 
assessments, 
and 
detailed 
engineering 
designs 
for all 
the 
road 
projects 
were 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
preparation 
of 
seven 
road 
projects financed 
under 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
2438 
-ET. 
It 
involves 
the 
rehabilitation and 
upgrading 
of 
412.9 
km 
of 
Federal 
Roads, 
out 
of 
which 
79 
km 
of 
existing 
asphalt 
paved 
trunk 
road 
is 
to 
be 
rehabilitated, 
while 
the 
remaining 
333.9 
km 
of 
trunk 
and 
link 
roads 
are 
to 
be 
upgraded 
from 
gravel 
to bituminous paved 
road 
surface standard. 
(i) 
The 
upmadinp 
of 
the 
NekemDt-Mekenaio 
road 
(127 
km) 
US$35.02 
million. 
The road 
is 
located 
in 
the 
western 
part 
of 
Ethiopia, and 
is 
entirely 
situated 
in 
the 
Oromiya 
Region. 
The 
route 
is 
situated 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
a 
coffee 
producing 
area, 
and 
is 
also 
a 
potential 
area 
for 
mining, 
mainly 
marble 
and 
gold, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
essential 
sources 
of 
foreign 
exchange earnings 
for 
the country. 
The 
area also 
experiences 
surplus 
production 
of 
cereals 
and 
grain 
for 
domestic 
needs. 
The 
road 
is 
fully 
engineered 
with 
gravel 
surface, 
7 
meters 
wide 
from 
shoulder 
to 
shoulder, 
with 
the 
riding 
surface 
in 
poor 
condition. 
The 
road 
is 
classified 
as 
trunk 
road 
and 
it 
is 
proposed 
for 
upgrading 
to 
an asphalt concrete surface 
with 
a 
7.0 
m 
width 
carriageway 
and 
1.5 
m 
wide 
shoulders. 
(ii). 
The 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
Nazareth-Assela 
road 
(79 
km) 
US$ 
19.35 
million. 
This 
section 
of 
the 
road 
is 
part 
of 
the 
rehabilitatiodupgrading 
of 
the 
Nazareth-Dodola/ 
Shashamane-Goba 
pavedgravel 
road. 
The 
other 
sections 
of 
the 
road 
have 
been 
proposed 
for 
IDA 
financing 
under 
APL 
11. 
The project 
road 
lies 
entirely 
in 
Oromiya Region 
in 
the South 
Eastern 
part 
of 
Ethiopia. 
It 
begins 
at 
Nazareth 
town, 
the 
riding 
surface 
is 
paved and 
has 
a 
width 
of 
7.0 
m. 
The overall 
road 
condition 
is 
fair 
to 
poor. 
The 
road 
is 
classified 
as 
a 
trunk 
road 
and 
is 
to 
be 
rehabilitated 
with 
an 
asphalt 
overlay 
surface 
to 
a 
7.0 
m 
width 
carriageway 
and 
1.5 
m 
wide 
shoulders. 
(iii) 
commences 
from 
the 
western 
end 
of 
the 
town 
of 
Woreta 
and 
terminates 
at 
Gob 
Gob, 
a 
small 
settlement 
on 
the 
Road 
leading 
to Woldia. 
This 
section 
is 
part 
of 
the 
Woreta 
- 
Woldia 
Road 
upgrading Project 
covering 
a 
total 
length 
of 
about 
293 
km. 
The 
other 
sections are 
proposed 
for 
financing 
under 
the 
APL 
11. 
The 
project 
road 
lies 
entirely 
in 
the 
Amhara 
Region. 
It 
is 
of 
high 
socio-economic 
importance and 
serves 
as 
a 
major traffic 
collector, 
traversing 
mostly 
difficult 
terrain 
to 
connect 
the 
Wollo 
and Gondar 
sub-regions. 
The road 
is 
classified 
as 
a 
major 
link 
road, 
and 
is 
a 
fully 
engineered gravel-surface 
road 
originally 
constructed 
between 
1977 
and 
1983, 
and 
later 
regravelled 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ERRP. 
The 
mountainous nature 
of 
the 
area 
traversed 
by 
the 
road 
has 
become 
a 
cause 
for 
erosion 
and 
surface wear. 
It 
is 
now 
recommended 
for 
upgrading 
from 
gravel 
to 
a 
double 
bituminous 
surface 
treated surface 
with 
carriageway 
width 
of 
7 
m 
and 
1.5 
m 
wide 
shoulders. 
The works 
on 
this 
section 
are 
to 
be 
packaged 
into 
at 
least 
3 
lots 
and contracted 
to 
enable 
increased domestic 
contractor 
participation 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project's 
domestic 
contractor 
capacity 
development 
objective. 
(iv) 
the 
Adigrat-Axum-Shire 
road 
that 
provides an 
important 
east-west 
link 
between 
the 
two 
primary 
North-South 
trunk 
roads 
in 
the 
northern 
region 
of 
Tigray. 
The 
mountainous 
terrain, 
which 
the 
road 
traverses, 
makes 
transportation 
difficult 
during 
the 
wet 
season. 
The 
existing 
road 
is 
a 
fully 
engineered 
gravel 
surface 
road 
with 
a carriageway 
width 
of 
7 
m 
covering 
an 
underlying 
Telford 
base. 
The 
Telford 
base 
is 
exposed over 
some 
sections 
of 
the 
road 
in 
spite 
of 
being 
regravelled 
under 
the 
ERRP. 
The road 
is 
approximately 
50-60 
years 
old 
and 
the 
present 
pavement 
condition 
is 
fair 
to 
poor. 
It 
is 
classified 
as 
a 
major 
link 
road 
and 
is 
recommended 
to 
be 
upgraded 
from 
the 
existing 
gravel 
road 
to 
an 
asphaltic 
concrete surface. 
The 
remaining 
section 
of 
the 
road 
is 
proposed 
for 
IDA 
financing 
under the 
APL

It 
runs 
through 
the 
villages 
and 
towns 
of 
Sire, 
Bulo, 
Moye,

which 
is 
only 
accessible 
by 
four-wheel 
drive 
vehicles 
during

for 
(a) 
the 
improvement 
of

including 
mechanisms 
for 
their 
sustainable maintenance; 
(b) 
the 
promotion 
of 
the

(c) 
the 
provision 
of 
small 
scale

facilities 
(e.g., 
water 
wells) 
which 
contribute 
to 
reducing 
the 
travel and

(d) 
improving 
the 
institutional 
and 
financing 
frameworks 
for 
sustainable service 
delivery; 
and 
(e) 
promoting 
income 
generating 
activities. 
These 
interventions 
will 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
the 
local 
economy 
and 
thus 
contribute 
to 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
weredas, 
for 
which 
these 
plans 
will 
be 
prepared, 
will 
be 
identified 
with 
due 
regard 
to 
regional 
balance 
through 
discussions 
between 
central 
and 
regional 
governments, 
collaborating 
donors, 
and 
their 
preparation 
steered 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Development Committee. 
The 
studies 
will 
be 
undertaken 
from 
2003/04 
to 
end 
of 
2005/06. 
Each 
consultancy 
contract 
to 
be 
financed 
will 
cover 
the 
preparation 
of 
five 
WTTPs, 
with 
a 
requirement 
of 
about 
50-man 
months 
per 
contract. 
The 
cost 
for 
the 
100 
weredas 
is 
estimated 
about 
US$ 
4,850,000. 
The 
studies 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
two 
phases, 
during 
which 
period, 
ERA 
will 
be 
supported 
by

The 
cost 
of 
these

One 
of 
the 
focal 
areas 
of 
the 
program 
is 
to 
create 
awareness 
among 
all 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
program. 
To 
achieve 
this 
objective, 
it 
is 
critically 
important 
to 
formulate 
an 
IEC 
Strategy 
that 
will 
serve 
as 
an 
instrument 
for 
launching 
a 
broad 
based 
awareness 
raising 
campaign 
for 
the 
rural 
communities, concerned 
stakeholders 
and donors 
on 
the 
rural 
travel 
and 
transport 
issues. 
To 
this 
end 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
study, 
which 
will 
investigate 
and 
make recommendations 
on 
how 
to 
raise 
awareness 
and 
monitor 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
ERTTP. 
This 
study 
will 
develop a 
strategy 
for 
providing 
relevant information, 
education 
and 
communication 
to 
all 
stakeholders 
on 
the 
ERTTP. 
The 
strategy 
formulation, implementation, 
Amharic 
translation, 
media promotion 
are 
the 
activities 
to 
be financed 
under 
this 
component.

: 
The 
activities 
under 
this 
sub-component 
include: 
(i) 
the development 
of 
capacity 
building 
strategy, 
(ii) 
development 
of 
GIS 
systems, 
(iii) 
provision 
of 
transport 
facilities, 
training 
workshops, 
and 
seminars 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
ERTTP 
structures 
at 
the 
National, 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
levels. 
The 
development 
of 
a capacity 
building 
strategy 
will 
involve 
the 
following 
tasks: 
(i) 
identification 
of 
the 
capacity 
building 
needs; 
(ii) 
identification 
of 
the people 
to 
be 
trained 
and 
or 
target groups 
from 
both 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sector; 
(iii) 
detailed 
design 
of 
the 
training 
activities 
including 
production 
of 
training 
materials and 
instruments 
at 
the 
wereda 
level; 
(iv) 
identification 
of 
trainers (external) and 
potential 
trainers (internal); 
(v) 
identification 
of 
local 
partner 
institutions 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
the 
training 
activities; 
and 
(vi) 
programming 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
training 
activities. 
The 
approach 
may 
also 
require 
the 
identification 
of 
the 
skills/experience 
gaps 
within 
the 
country 
that 
would 
need 
to 
be 
provided 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
implementation 
using 
international 
TA 
together 
with 
a 
time 
bound 
strategy 
for 
their 
replacement 
by 
nationals. 
The 
need 
for 
properly mapping existing and 
planned 
local rural 
infrastructure 
is 
a 
central 
part 
of 
ERTTP. 
Thus 
the 
establishment of 
GIS 
systems 
at 
the 
national 
and 
regional 
levels 
is 
envisaged 
under 
the 
APL 
1. 
The 
proposed activities 
for 
financing 
are 
training 
in 
GIS 
systems, 
and 
provision 
of 
GPS 
equipment 
and 
software 
for 
all 
regions. 
The 
responsible 
body 
for 
the 
ERTTP 
implementation 
at 
the 
wereda 
level 
would 
be 
the 
wereda 
ERTTP 
Coordinating 
OfficeIDesk. 
The 
regional 
Coordinator 
would 
be 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
and 
monitor 
the implementation. 
In 
order 
to facilitate 
this 
activity 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
provision 
of 
16 
double 
cabin 
vehicles 
for 
regional 
and 
Pilot 
wereda coordinators. 
In 
addition 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
ERTTP 
pilot 
implementation 
need 
to 
be 
disseminated 
at 
the 
different 
weredas. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
provision 
of 
continuous 
training, 
workshops 
and 
seminars 
through out 
the 
coming 
three-years.

:. 
The 
Ethiopian 
Government's 
HIV/AIDS 
policy 
urges 
communities 
at 
large, 
including 
ministries, 
regional 
governments, 
local 
governments 
and 
the 
civil 
society 
to 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
carrying 
out 
HIV/AIDS 
awareness 
and prevention 
campaigns. 
In 
line 
with 
this 
policy, 
and 
the 
findings 
of 
different 
studies 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
work 
places 
(which 
confirm 
that 
the 
transport 
sector 
a 
one 
of 
the 
breeding 
grounds 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
and a 
vehicle 
of 
the 
pandemic), 
ERA 
and 
the 
IDA 
had 
taken 
the 
initiative 
to 
retrofit 
HW/AIDS 
activities 
under 
the 
RSDP 
I 
operations. 
ERA 
since 
then 
has 
been 
engaged 
in 
the development 
and 
the implementation 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
awareness 
and 
prevention program 
within 
the 
road 
sector. 
Activities 
on 
the 
prevention 
and 
control 
measures have 
been 
started 
at 
project 
sites, 
especially 
under 
the 
major 
civil 
works 
contracts. 
ERA 
also 
submitted 
a 
proposal 
to 
the 
MAP 
with 
an 
estimated 
budget 
of 
1.2 
M 
USD 
for 
a 
three-year 
program 
and the 
first 
year's 
activities 
are 
underway 
with 
the 
approved 
budget 
of 
0.4 
M 
USD. 
Based 
on 
the 
proposal, 
ERA 
under 
the 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
Branch, 
has 
recruited 
two 
professionals 
(one 
Sociologist 
- 
project 
coordinator)  and 
one 
Health officer 
(assistant 
project 
coordinator) 
to 
carry out 
the 
day-to-day 
activities and 
implement 
the 
intervention 
measures. 
The 
tasks 
of 
the 
project 
coordinators 
include 
advocacy 
work, Information, Education 
and 
Communication 
(IEC), 
provision 
and 
distribution 
of 
protective 
devices, 
analytical 
work 
and 
outsourcing activities 
like 
increasing 
the 
access 
to 
prevention 
services 
regarding 
sexually 
transmitted 
diseases 
(STDs) and 
HIV/AIDS. 
The 
unit 
is 
working 
with 
a) 
ERA 
staff 
at 
Headquarters, 
Projects 
and Districts; 
b) 
Local 
and 
international 
contractors; 
and 
c) 
communities 
interacting 
with 
ERA 
road 
projects. 
In 
order 
to 
guide 
the 
coordinators, 
the 
recruitment 
of 
a consultant 
with

to 
carry out 
a baseline survey

is 
designed 
to 
complement 
the 
national 
MAP 
HIV/AIDS 
program 
of 
the 
country 
and 
further 
capitalize 
on 
the 
activities

The 
support 
to 
ERA 
will 
comprise the 
provision 
of 
a 
consulting 
service 
to 
enhance 
ERA'S 
capacity 
to 
plan, 
procure 
and 
administer 
civil 
construction 
and 
service 
contracts, 
and 
manage 
contract claims 
and 
disputes. 
The 
scope 
of 
services 
will 
be 
targeted 
at 
Project 
Planning, Procurement, 
Contract 
Administration, 
Review of 
Engineering 
Design, 
Claims 
Avoidance 
and 
Dispute 
Handling. 
It 
is 
also 
intended 
to 
train 
ERA 
personnel 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
planning 
and programming, environment 
and 
social 
impact 
management, 
and contract 
administration 
and 
management. 
One 
of 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
social and environmental supervision 
under 
RSDP 
I, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
workshop 
on 
social 
aspects 
of 
transport operations 
held 
in 
February/March 
2003, 
is 
that 
the 
project 
planning 
and 
implementation 
process 
need 
to 
increase 
inclusion 
of 
local 
communities and 
local 
governments along 
the 
road 
alignments. 
A 
strategic 
partnership 
with 
local 
communities 
in 
project 
planning 
and 
implementation 
doesn't 
only 
facilitate 
right-of-way 
issues 
(resettlement 
/rehabilitation/environmental 
impact mitigation) 
and 
the 
work 
of 
the 
contractors, 
but 
it 
also 
provides 
critical 
inputs 
into 
the 
road 
design 
and 
the 
poverty 
impacts 
of 
the 
road. 
Three 
activities 
that 
would 
be 
strengthened 
to 
increase 
social inclusion, and 
better 
address 
road 
constructiodtransport related 
poverty 
issues 
of 
local 
communities 
are: 
a) 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
road 
specific 
IEC 
programs focusing 
on 
road 
construction related 
issues 
(e.g. 
safety, 
right 
of 
way, 
resettlementhehabilitation, environmental 
impact mitigation, 
HIV/AIDS) for 
local 
communities 
and 
local 
governments; 
b)

and 
implementation 
of 
community

operations 
related to 
road 
construction 
work 
(e.g., 
relocation 
of 
market 
places, 
location 
and 
improvement 
of 
"bus 
stops'', 
location 
of 
water 
bore holes 
to 
serve 
both 
contractors 
and 
communities, 
planting 
of 
trees 
for 
shades 
at 
"bus 
stops", 
etc.) 
In 
addition, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
monitoring 
the 
impact 
of 
transport 
on 
poverty 
alleviation, 
transport 
- 
poverty 
observatories 
will 
be 
established 
on 
each 
road 
alignment at 
local 
community 
and household 
level 
to 
monitor 
environmental and 
social outcome 
indicators 
over a 
period 
of 
3-5 
years 
panel 
survey. 
This 
would 
enable 
ERA 
and 
GOE, 
under 
the 
RSDP 
11, 
to 
get 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
impacts 
of 
transport 
on 
poverty 
alleviation 
in 
terms 
of 
performance 
in 
social 
outcomes 
at 
the 
household 
level 
along 
each

This 
work 
will 
be 
crafted 
to 
be 
executed 
in 
a 
partnership 
between 
the 
ERA, 
contractors, 
universities 
and 
NGOs. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
observatories, 
will 
contribute 
to 
planning 
and 
designing 
roads 
that 
would 
better

Summary 
of 
Benefits and 
Costs: 
General. 
For 
the 
identified 
national 
and 
regional 
road 
projects, 
specific 
traffic 
counts 
and 
projections, 
as 
well 
as 
preliminary 
engineering 
designs, 
were 
prepared 
with 
a 
view 
to 
appraise 
their 
economic 
feasibility. 
The 
analysis 
is 
presented 
in 
three 
sections. 
Section 
A 
presents 
key 
assumptions, 
input 
data 
and 
methodology 
used 
in 
the 
analysis. 
Section 
B 
presents 
the 
economic analysis 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
upgrading 
of 
four 
federal 
roads: 
(1) 
Nazareth-Assela  section 
(79 
km) 
of 
the  Nazareth-Dodola-Goba 
federal 
road; 
(2) 
Woreta-Gob 
Gob 
section 
(99 
km) 
of 
the 
Woreta-Woldiya 
federal 
road; 
(3) 
Adigrat-Adwa 
section 
(108 
km) 
of 
the 
Adigrat-Shire 
federal 
road; 
and 
(4) 
Nekempt- 
Mekenajo 
federal 
road 
(127 
km). 
Section 
C 
presents 
economic 
analysis 
for 
construction 
of 
Dera-Magna 
section 
(1 
19 
km) 
of 
the 
Dera-Mechara 
link 
federal 
road 
to 
a 
high 
standard 
gravel 
road. 
A. 
Assumptions, 
Input 
Data 
and 
Methodology 
TrafJic 
Levels. 
Normal 
traffic 
has 
been 
updated 
to 
take account 
of 
ERA’S 
2001 
classified 
traffic 
count. 
The 
table 
below 
shows 
the 
Average 
Annual 
Daily 
Traffic 
for 
the 
base 
year, 
for 
the 
project 
roads. 
Traflc 
Projections. 
Traffic 
projections 
on 
the 
project 
road 
have 
taken 
into 
account 
past 
and 
future 
trend 
in 
GDP 
growth, 
population 
increase, 
agricultural 
activities, 
tourism, 
AADT, 
vehicle 
fleet 
and 
fuel 
consumption. 
These 
are 
among 
the 
major 
factors 
influencing traffic growth 
rates 
on 
the 
project 
road. 
Costs. 
Construction 
is 
assumed 
to 
start 
in 
2004 
and 
last 
for 
three 
years, 
thus 
the 
road 
will 
be 
open 
to 
traffic 
in 
2007. 
The analysis 
period 
is 
assumed 
to 
cover 
20 
years 
period 
i.e. 
up 
to 
the 
year 
2023. 
The 
investment 
spread 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
as 
follows: 
2004: 
lo%, 
2005: 
45% 
and 
2006: 45%. 
The 
financial 
construction 
and 
maintenance 
costs 
have 
been 
converted 
into 
economic 
costs 
by 
applying 
a 
conversion 
factor 
of 
0.76. 
The 
vehicle operating 
costs 
were estimated based 
on 
input 
costs 
from 
recent 
Ethiopian 
vehicle 
fleet 
data.

Methodology. 
The 
HDM 
3 
model 
(in 
HDM 
Manager) 
has 
been 
used 
for 
the 
analysis. 
The 
proposed 
option 
has 
been 
compared 
with 
a “do 
minimum” 
case. 
The 
“do 
minimum 
case”  assumes 
that 
a 
minimum 
amount 
of 
maintenance 
of 
the 
existing 
road 
will 
be 
carried 
out. 
The 
economic  analysis 
is 
based 
on 
benefits 
to 
road traffic 
(in 
terms 
of 
savings 
in 
VOCs 
& 
road 
maintenance 
costs) 
compared 
with 
the 
costs 
of 
rehabilitatiodupgrading 
and 
maintenance. 
Discounted benefits 
are 
then 
compared 
to 
discounted 
costs 
to 
produce 
measures 
of 
worth. 
Sensitivity 
analysis was done 
taking 
into 
account 
three 
scenarios 
namely 
a 
20% 
increase 
in 
costs, 
a 
20% 
decrease 
in 
benefits 
and 
the 
worst 
case 
(costs 
+20% 
& 
benefits 
-20%). 
Benefits. 
The proposed 
rehabilitationhpgrading 
of 
the 
project 
road 
would 
have essential 
benefits 
to 
the 
nation’s economy 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
environment 
including: 
e 
Reduced 
travel 
time 
e 
Increased 
road 
safety 
0 
Area 
development. 
0 
Reduced 
vehicle operating 
cost 
(e.g.

NPV/EIRR 
& 
Sensitivity 
Analysis. 
Five 
links 
have 
been 
defined 
on 
the 
Nazareth-Dodola-Goba 
road 
based 
on 
the 
engineering 
sections 
and 
homogeneous

(1) 
Nazareth-Assela; 
(2) 
Assela-Dodola; 
(3) 
Dodola-Melkawakena; 
(4) 
Melkawakena-Goba;  and 
(5) 
Shashemene-Dodola. 
The 
economic analysis 
is 
conducted 
for 
the 
first 
section 
of 
this 
road, 
to 
be 
included 
for 
financing 
in 
Stage 
1. 
Much 
of 
the 
stretch 
of 
the 
road 
would 
be 
upgraded 
to 
double 
surface treatment, 
while 
only 
the 
first 
link 
would 
be 
rehabilitated 
to 
a 
50 
mm 
thick 
asphalt 
concrete 
surface. 
Each 
link 
option 
has 
been compared 
with 
the 
“ 
do-minimum 
case” 
for 
the 
economic analysis. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Results 
The 
base 
case 
has 
resulted 
in 
an 
Economic Internal 
Rate 
of

of 
47.8% 
and a 
Net

The 
sensitivity 
analysis 
indicates  that  the 
EIRR 
values 
vary 
from 
37% 
to 
43% 
depending 
on 
the

EIRR 
in 
this 
case 
would 
be

Dera-Magna 
section 
(119 
km) 
of 
the 
Dera-Mechara 
link 
federal 
road 
The 
proposed 
road 
is 
a 
track 
accessible 
by 
four-wheel 
drives 
during 
the 
dry 
season. 
It 
is 
proposed 
to 
construct a 
feeder 
road 
with 
6.0 
m 
wide 
carriageway 
with 
shoulders 
1.5 
m 
wide 
each 
and 
the 
surface 
will 
be 
a 
gravel 
pavement. 
Economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
project road 
has 
been 
worked out 
using 
the 
producer 
surplus 
approach. 
The 
proposed 
construction 
option 
has 
been 
compared 
with 
a 
“without 
road” 
case. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
benefits 
will 
not 
accrue 
before 
the 
road 
is 
completed. 
The 
economic analysis 
is 
based 
on 
benefits 
in 
terms 
of 
increase 
in 
agricultural 
outputs 
(hence generated 
traffic) 
compared 
with 
the 
costs 
of 
construction and 
maintenance. 
Discounted 
benefits 
are 
then 
compared 
to 
discounted 
costs 
to 
produce 
measures 
of 
worth.

The

would 
have 
essential 
benefits 
to 
the 
nation’s 
economy 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
environment 
including: 
e 
Reduced 
travel 
time 
e 
Reduced 
noise 
and 
air 
pollution 
and 
Area 
development and hence 
traffic 
generation. 
In 
addition, 
during 
the 
construction period, 
the 
project 
will 
also generate 
employment 
for 
the 
people 
near 
the 
construction 
area. 
NPV/EIRR 
& 
Sensitivity Analysis. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
economic 
analysis 
has 
been 
worked 
out using 
the 
producer 
surplus 
approach. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Results 
From 
the 
economic analysis, 
it 
can 
be 
seen 
that 
the 
base 
case 
has 
resulted 
in 
an 
Economic Internal 
Rate 
of 
Return 
of 
20.9% 
and 
a 
Net 
Present 
Value 
of 
ETB 
180.8 
million. 
The 
sensitivity 
analysis indicates that 
the 
EIRR 
values 
vary 
from 
13% 
to 
17% 
depending 
on 
the 
sensitivity 
test 
applied. 
. 
The 
project 
would 
still 
be 
feasible 
with 
the 
worst 
case 
(benefits 
-20% 
& 
costs 
+20%)-EIRR 
in 
this 
case 
would 
be 
13.3%. 
The 
first 
year 
rate 
of 
return 
is 
below 
12 percent. 
However, 
as 
this 
is 
construction 
of 
a 
road 
passing 
through 
an 
agricultural 
area 
and 
the 
methodology 
is 
based 
on 
producer 
surplus 
approach, 
the 
growth 
in 
traffic 
(and 
the 
resulting 
benefits) 
will 
lag 
behind 
the 
actual construction.

that 
for 
the

construction 
costs 
would 
need 
to 
increase 
by 
over 
75% 
in 
order 
for 
the 
NPV 
to 
be 
zero. 
Similarly 
benefits 
would 
need 
to 
be 
reduced 
by 
more 
than 
40% 
to 
achieve 
the 
same 
result.

General 
The 
Federal Government 
Financial 
Proclamation 
No. 
57/1996 
(Part 
Eleven 
-Procurement Contracts) 
and 
subsequent 
amendments 
constitute the applicable 
procurement regulations 
in 
Ethiopia. 
It 
was based 
on 
the 
1995 
Constitution, 
by 
which 
the 
autonomous 
regional 
governments 
were 
made 
responsible 
for 
their 
own 
procurement. 
The 
"MOF 
procurement and 
contract 
directives regulations" 
were 
amended 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
August 
1998 
CPAR 
recommendations, 
and 
a 
"Procurement 
Manual" 
for 
use 
of

Ministries 
was 
drafted 
under 
Bank 
assistance 
and 
is 
currently 
the 
mandatory 
guideline 
for 
public 
sector 
procurement. 
A 
recent 
CPAR 
was also 
carried out 
and 
a 
draft 
report 
was 
sent 
to 
Government 
on 
June 
28,2002 
including 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
capacity 
of 
implementing 
agencies. 
ERA'S

capacity 
was also 
assessed 
as 
part 
of 
this 
exercise. 
The 
lessons 
learnt 
during

Procurement Capacity 
of 
ERA. 
1. 
The 
procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
ERA 
was also 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
ERA’S 
overall 
institutional 
capacity 
assessment 
for 
the 
appraisal 
and 
start 
of 
the 
RSDP 
in 
July 
1997. 
Since 
then 
the 
procurement capacity 
has 
been 
monitored 
continuously 
as 
part 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
three 
IDA 
financed projects 
under 
Credit 
2438-ET, 3032-ET 
and 
the 
Roads 
Component 
of 
the 
ERP 
Credit 
3438-ET. 
ERA 
has 
demonstrated 
its 
capacity 
throughout. 
However, 
additional 
institutional 
support 
is 
required 
for 
managing 
the increased 
scope 
of 
the 
program 
under 
the 
RSDP 
11. 
Institutional 
Support 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
ERA, 
under 
the 
APL 
I, 
in 
areas 
of,  among 
others, 
procurement, 
design 
review 
and approval, contract 
administration, and claims 
avoidance 
and management. 
The 
support 
will 
also 
include training 
of 
ERA 
personnel. 
In 
addition, 
the 
TA 
support 
being 
provided 
with 
funding 
by 
other 
donor 
partners 
- 
AfDB, 
DFID, 
EC, 
would 
further 
equip 
ERA 
to 
implement 
the 
full 
scope 
of 
the 
procurement and contract administration responsibilities 
required 
for 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
implementation. 
Based 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
General Manager 
of 
the 
ERA, 
the 
ERA 
Board 
is 
the 
final 
decision 
making body 
with 
regard 
to 
procurement 
related 
matters. 
The 
decisions 
thresholds 
set 
in 
Government 
procurement regulations 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
now 
provide 
ERA 
executive 
management 
with 
authorization 
to 
approve procurement transactions 
of 
ETB 
2 
million 
(about 
USD 
230,000 equivalent),  an 
increase 
from 
ETB 
250,000 (about 
USD 
30,000 
equivalent). 
This 
is 
a 
positive 
step 
towards 
the 
expedition 
of 
procurement 
of 
small 
maintenance 
works 
contracts 
and 
the 
associated 
supervision consultancy 
services. 
Procurement 
Plan. 
A 
procurement 
plan 
for 
the 
project 
has 
been 
prepared 
by 
the 
Borrower 
as 
part 
of 
a 
draft Project 
Implementation 
Plan 
(PIP) 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
in 
December 
2002. 
The 
plan 
was 
reviewed 
during 
appraisal, 
and 
discussed 
during 
negotiations 
and 
ERA 
will 
adopt 
the 
final 
PIP 
prior 
to 
grant 
effectivemenss 
date. 
The 
PIP 
includes, 
among 
others, a 
detailed procurement 
plan for 
civil 
works 
and 
consultancy 
services. 
Procurement 
Implementation 
Arrangements 
Procurement 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
ERA 
under 
its 
Contract 
Administration 
Division, 
for 
works 
and 
services, 
and 
the 
Procurement 
Division 
for 
Goods. 
ERA 
executive 
management 
has 
an authorization 
to 
approve procurement transactions 
up 
to 
a 
threshold 
of 
about 
USD 
230,000. 
The 
ERA 
Board 
will 
give 
the 
final 
decision 
with 
regard 
to 
procurement 
related 
matters, above 
this 
threshold,  based 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
General 
Manager 
of 
the 
ERA.

One 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the

is 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
domestic 
contractors 
by 
increasing 
their  participation 
in

executed 
by 
domestic  contractors 
in 
Ethiopia, over 
the 
three-year 
period, 
May 
1998 
- 
May 
2001, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the

and 
Eritrea, 
GOE 
have recommended, 
and 
IDA 
has 
consented, 
to 
reduce 
the 
annual

requirements 
for 
domestic contractors 
bidding 
for 
the

PHASE 
I 
PROJECT 
Financial 
Management 
1. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
Financial 
Management 
Introduction 
The 
Bank’s 
policy 
(OP 
10.02) 
requires 
borrowers and 
project 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
maintain 
financial 
management 
systems, 
including 
accounting, 
financial reporting 
and 
auditing 
systems, 
adequate 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
can 
provide to 
the 
Bank 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
regarding 
project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
The 
assessment 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
this 
project 
was done 
in 
line 
with 
the 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Sector 
Board 
in 
June 2001. 
Countrv 
Issues 
A 
final 
draft report 
on 
the 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA)-Ethiopia, 
was 
issued 
and 
submitted 
to 
Government 
on 
March 
3 
1,2003. 
The 
overall 
conclusion 
is 
that considerable 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
the 
rationalization 
and 
strengthening 
of 
budgeting 
process 
at 
the 
Federal level.  Despite 
some 
progress made 
in 
last 
three 
years, 
there 
are 
weaknesses 
in 
medium-term 
planning, 
accounting, 
auditing 
and reporting.  Remedial 
actions 
on 
the 
weaknesses 
will 
be taken through 
the 
Expenditure 
Management 
and 
Control 
Program (EMCP), 
the 
Capacity 
Building 
Project 
for 
Decentralized 
Service 
Project (CBDSD) 
and 
Public 
Service 
Delivery 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
(PSCAP). 
Implementinp 
Entities 
for 
the Roads 
Program 
The overall program 
and 
project 
management 
and 
coordination 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority 
(ERA). 
ERA 
will 
manage 
all 
the 
components 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
APL, 
but 
in 
the 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
APL, 
the 
Regional 
Roads 
Authorities 
(RRAs) 
and 
Ethiopian 
Rural 
Travel 
and 
Transport Program (ERTTP) 
Offices 
at 
all 
levels 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation. 
Ireland 
Aid 
and 
DFID 
have 
provided 
financing 
for 
the 
ERTTP 
pilot 
implementation 
activities 
in 
8 weredas, 
and 
their 
experience 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
designing the 
implementation 
and 
funds 
flow 
arrangements 
in 
the 
second and 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
APL. 
ERA 
is 
currently implementing 
two 
active projects financed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
Road 
Sector 
development 
Program 
Support 
Project 
(RSDPSP, 
Cr. 
3032-ET) 
and 
components 
from 
Emergency 
Recovery Project 
(343 8-ET). 
ERA 
had 
successfully 
implemented 
various 
Bank 
and donor-financed 
projects 
in 
the 
past, 
including 
the 
Road 
Rehabilitation Project 
(RRP, 
Cr. 
2438-ET), 
which 
was 
closed 
on 
December 
3 
1,2002. 
In 
the 
existing active projects 
and 
the 
already 
closed 
ones, 
management 
and 
administration 
of 
funds 
are 
done 
at 
a 
central 
level 
by 
ERA 
and 
there 
has 
been 
no 
problem 
in 
disbursements 
and accounting 
of 
funds. 
ERA 
has 
a 
Finance 
and 
Administrative 
Department staffed 
with 
adequate 
and appropriately 
qualified 
staff. 
The 
Project 
Finance 
Section 
in 
the 
department handles 
all 
project 
related 
transactions. 
Staff 
working 
in 
the 
section have 
very 
good 
experience 
and understanding 
and 
are 
capable 
of 
handling 
project 
financial 
transactions 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA’S 
disbursement 
guidelines 
and procedures. 
In 
the 
past 
four 
years, 
there 
has 
been 
a 
substantial 
improvement 
in 
the 
finance 
division 
of 
ERA 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
qualified 
manpower 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
annual 
financial 
reports. 
The backlogs 
in 
the 
submission 
of 
entity 
audit 
reports, 
which 
existed 
at 
the 
start 
of 
RSDP 
I 
have 
been 
cleared and 
currently 
ERA 
is 
-

- 
Page  96
up-to-date 
in 
closing 
the 
accounts 
and 
submitting 
the 
entity 
audit 
reports. 
The 
qualification 
points 
on 
the 
annual 
audit 
reports 
have 
also 
been 
reduced 
substantially 
in 
the last 
couple 
of 
years. 
The 
main 
qualification points 
mentioned 
in 
the last couple 
of 
years 
were 
long 
outstanding 
balances 
in 
goods-in-transit, 
debtors, 
creditors 
and 
cash 
at 
Bank 
accounts. 
IDA, 
through 
RRP

2438-ET, 
provided 
TA 
support 
to 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
ERA. 
In 
this 
TA, 
the 
Organizational 
Structure 
of 
the 
Finance 
Division 
was 
clearly 
defined 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Management 
of 
ERA, 
chart 
of 
accounts was 
designed 
and 
are 
being 
implemented, 
long 
outstanding 
balances 
in 
bank, debtors and 
creditors 
accounts cleared, 
other 
related 
activities 
are 
done, 
and 
the 
computerization 
process 
is 
underway 
with 
support 
of 
TA 
financed 
by 
GTZ 
and 
DFID. 
With 
the 
GTZ 
support, 
the 
ACCPAC 
accounting 
software 
is 
currently 
being 
installed 
in 
the 
Head 
Office 
of 
ERA. 
Employees 
are 
taking 
training 
on 
the 
use 
of 
the 
ACCPAC 
software 
and 
it 
is 
intended 
to 
close 
the 
accounts 
of 
ERA 
using 
the 
ACCPAC 
software 
for 
the 
year 
to 
be 
ended 
7 
July 
2003. 
With 
the Support 
of 
DFID, 
the 
ACCPAC 
accounting 
software 
has 
been 
already 
installed 
in 
the 
district 
offices 
of 
ERA 
and 
training 
is 
underway to 
equip 
employees 
with 
the 
software. 
Other 
tasks 
may 
need 
additional financing 
from 
the 
RSDP 
I1 
depending 
on 
the 
scope 
and 
progress 
of 
the 
GTZ 
and

Some 
of 
the 
resources 
from 
RSDP 
I1 
will 
be 
required 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
ERA 
are 
further 
strengthened 
in 
terms 
of 
quality 
of 
reports and adequately 
trained 
manpower. 
The 
resource, 
when 
confirmed 
with 
the 
cooperating 
donors, 
will 
be 
used 
to 
complete 
the 
already 
started 
computerization 
process 
by 
acquiring additional 
hardware 
and, 
if 
necessary, 
additional 
software, and 
training 
of 
staff to 
use 
the 
systems. 
ERA 
is 
implementing 
a 
program 
of 
commercialization 
of 
its 
district 
maintenance 
office 
activities 
with 
DFID 
support. 
The existing 
financial 
management 
systems 
would 
therefore 
need 
to 
be 
changed 
to 
accommodate 
the 
commercialization 
activities 
at the 
district 
levels. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
additional trained 
staff 
would 
be 
required 
and 
the 
systems 
would 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
to 
accommodate 
producing 
of 
profit 
and 
loss 
accounts 
for 
the 
districts. Associated 
with 
this 
is 
the 
decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting 
activities 
at 
the 
district 
levels. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the 
decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting activities 
at 
the 
district 
level 
will 
start 
on 
July 
8, 
2003 
when 
DMOs 
will 
become cost centers. 
They 
are also 
programmed 
to 
become 
profit 
centers 
by 
July 
2005, 
and 
commercial 
entities 
by 
July 
2006. 
Decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting activities 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
less 
problematic than 
the 
commercialization 
process 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
decentralization 
of 
accounting 
activities 
need 
only 
additional 
staff to 
use 
the 
existing 
systems, 
whereas 
the 
commercialization 
would 
require 
a 
change 
of 
systems. 
Flow 
of 
funds 
ERA 
will 
open a Special 
Account (SA) 
at 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Ethiopia. 
IDA 
will 
transfer 
the 
initial 
advance 
and 
subsequent 
deposits 
to 
the 
created 
SA. 
ERA 
will 
then 
pay 
contractors 
and 
suppliers 
from 
the 
SA. 
The 
amount 
for 
the 
initial 
advance 
and 
subsequent 
deposits 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
cash 
flow 
requirements 
of 
ERA 
for 
four 
months 
of 
estimated expenditure 
for 
the 
IDA 
portion 
only.

So 
far, 
no 
problems 
are 
anticipated 
in 
processing 
withdrawal 
applications and 
making 
payments 
to 
the 
contractors 
since 
all 
the 
payments are 
made 
centrally 
by 
ERA 
which 
will 
build 
on 
their 
experience 
in 
dealing 
with 
several 
contractors 
under 
the 
ongoing 
projects. 
Staffing 
ERA 
Head 
Office 
has 
adequate 
number 
of 
staff 
with 
the 
required educational background 
and 
experience. 
The 
districts 
are 
currently employing 
accountants, 
with 
BA 
degree 
in 
accounting, 
who 
will 
be 
handling 
the 
decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting activities 
at 
the 
district 
level, 
starting 
8 
July 
2003. 
Decentralization 
of 
the 
accounting 
activities 
will 
be 
the 
most 
challenging 
task 
for 
ERA 
under 
this 
process. 
Accounting 
policies 
and procedures 
ERA 
uses 
accrual 
basis 
of 
accounting 
using 
the 
double entry accounting 
system. 
ERA 
follows 
the 
International Accounting 
Standards 
(IAS) 
in 
recording 
and 
reporting financial 
transactions. 
ERA 
has 
developed a 
financial 
management 
manual 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a reference 
book 
for all 
the staff. 
The 
ACCPAC 
accounting 
software 
is 
installed 
both 
at 
the 
Head 
Office 
and 
districts 
is 
being 
tested 
and 
used. 
Internal 
Controls 
Internal 
control 
comprises 
the 
entire 
systems 
of 
control, 
financial 
or 
otherwise, 
established 
by 
management 
in 
order 
to, 
(a) 
carry 
out 
the 
project 
activities 
in 
an 
orderly 
and 
efficient 
manner; 
(b) 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
policies 
and 
procedures; 
and 
(c) safeguard 
the 
assets 
of 
the 
project 
and 
secure 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
the 
completeness 
and accuracy 
of 
the 
financial 
and 
other records. 
ERA 
has 
an 
Internal 
Audit 
Unit. 
The 
Unit 
reports 
directly 
to 
the 
general 
manager 
of 
ERA. 
The 
Unit 
mainly 
conducts special investigations. 
In 
order 
to 
enhance 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Unit 
to 
perform 
post 
audit 
activities, 
required 
staff 
with 
adequate 
experience 
and 
educational 
qualifications 
should 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
Unit. 
The 
Bank 
will 
assess 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Unit 
after 
one 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Reporting 
and 
monitoring 
The 
existing 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
system 
of 
ERA 
is 
capable 
of 
producing 
accurate 
and 
reliable 
information 
regarding 
project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
The 
system 
will 
provide reliable 
records and 
reports 
on all 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
financial 
transactions 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
sufficient financial 
information 
for 
managing 
and 
monitoring 
activities. 
ERA 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
designed 
to 
produce 
financial 
statements 
of 
the 
entity 
as 
a 
whole 
to 
be 
used 
by 
government 
and 
all 
donors. 
The 
sources 
from all 
donors 
would 
be 
easily 
identified 
from 
the 
chart 
of 
accounts and 
the 
expenditures 
could 
be reported 
by 
major 
categories 
of 
expenditure. 
ERA 
will 
produce quarterly 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
and 
submit 
the 
same 
to 
IDA 
45 
days 
after the 
end 
of 
each 
quarter. 
The 
FMRs 
will 
include 
financial, 
physical 
progress 
and 
procurement 
information. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
the 
financial

it 
will 
conduct

Disbursement Arrangements 
There 
are 
two 
ways 
in 
disbursing 
funds 
from 
the 
Bank. 
The 
first 
one 
is 
the 
traditional- 
disbursement 
method, 
which 
uses 
SA, 
SOE 
procedures and 
direct 
payment procedures. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
report-based 
method, 
in 
which 
regular 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMR) 
plus 
additional 
statements 
will 
be 
the 
basis 
for 
disbursement. 
ERA 
has 
selected 
the 
traditional way 
of 
disbursement 
using 
SA, 
SOE 
and 
direct 
payment 
procedures.

will 
retain 
all 
the 
Supporting documentation 
for 
SOEs, 
including 
completion 
reports 
and certificates. 
The 
supporting 
documents 
will 
be 
made 
available 
to 
IDA 
during 
project 
supervision 
and 
be 
audited annually 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Association. 
Disbursements 
for 
expenditures above 
these 
thresholds 
will 
be 
made 
against 
presentation 
of 
full 
documentation 
relating to 
those 
expenditures. 
During 
the 
project launch 
workshop, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
session 
on 
proper preparation 
of 
withdrawal 
applications, 
including 
the 
preparation 
and 
submission 
of

Special account: 
To 
facilitate 
disbursements 
against 
eligible 
expenditures 
under 
the 
Credit, 
ERA 
will 
establish a Special 
Account 
(SA) 
in 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Ethiopia. 
The 
authorized 
allocation 
for 
the 
Special 
Account 
will 
be 
$12,000,000. 
Upon 
effectiveness, 
IDA 
will 
deposit 
an 
initial 
deposit 
up 
to 
$6,000,000 
into 
the 
Special 
Account. 
Once 
the 
total 
disbursements 
from 
the 
Credit 
account, 
including 
commitments, 
have 
reached 
an 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
SDR 
15,000,000; 
the 
initial 
allocation 
may 
be 
increased 
up 
to 
the 
authorized 
allocation 
of 
$12,000,000. 
ERA 
will 
submit 
replenishment 
applications 
at 
least once 
in 
a 
month. 
The 
Special 
Account 
will 
be 
audited annually 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA. 
Counterpart 
funds 
ERA, 
in 
its 
annual 
budgets, 
will 
include 
the 
counterpart 
contributions 
in 
local 
currency 
to 
cover 
the 
projected 
expenditure 
for 
the 
following 
financial 
year.

The 
Transport 
System. 
The transport 
infrastructure 
in 
Ethiopia 
comprises 
a 
road network 
estimated 
(in 
2002) 
at about 
33,000 
km 
(all 
classified 
with 
unquantified 
other 
unclassified 
roads, 
paths 
and 
tracks); 
a 
780 
km 
railway 
line 
from 
Addis 
Ababa 
to 
Djibouti 
(about 
709 
km 
within 
Ethiopia);  a 
national 
merchant 
marine; 
and 
air 
transport facilities 
including 
two 
international 
airports, 
seven 
major 
domestic airports, 
and over 
30 
other 
domestic 
runways 
and 
airstrips. 
Ethiopia 
is 
now 
a 
land-locked 
country and 
almost 
98 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
export 
and 
import 
needs 
are 
presently 
served 
through 
the 
Djibouti 
port.

Road 
Transport 
Infrastructure. 
Road 
transport 
is 
the 
dominant 
mode 
of 
transport 
and 
it 
plays 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
supporting 
the 
economic and 
social 
development programs. 
The 
roads, 
in 
general, 
carry 
about 
95 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
passenger 
and 
freight 
traffic 
and 
provide 
the 
only 
form 
of 
access 
to 
most 
rural 
communities. 
Of 
the 
total 
classified 
road 
network, 
about 
16,000 
km 
are 
federal roads 
and 
17,000 
km 
regional 
roads. 
About 
4,000 
km 
(12 
%) 
are 
paved 
roads 
(all 
federal) 
and 
the 
remaining 
29,000 
km 
are 
gravel 
or 
earth 
surfaced.  Since 
1998, 
road 
transport 
has become 
even 
more important 
in 
connecting 
supply 
and 
demand 
centers 
because 
of 
a 
growing 
emphasis 
on 
poverty 
by 
connecting remote 
rural 
communities 
with 
the 
regional 
road network 
and 
improving 
accessibility. 
However, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
road 
transport, 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
has 
been 
generally 
poor: 
only 
about 
12 
percent 
of 
the 
road 
network 
is 
paved and 
road 
density 
remains 
one 
of 
the 
lowest 
in 
Africa 
(Table 
1). 
The 
road 
density 
at 
30 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
in 
2002, 
although 
better 
than 
that 
in 
1994, 
only 
21 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km, 
is 
still 
below 
the 
average 
of 
50 
km 
per 
1000 
sq. 
km 
for 
Africa 
(Table 
1). 
The 
access 
to 
ports, 
markets 
and 
services 
is 
poor. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
about 
70 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
area 
of 
the 
country 
is 
more than 
half 
a 
day’s 
walk 
from 
all-weather 
roads. 
Responsibility 
for 
the 
road network 
is 
divided principally 
between 
(i) 
the 
Ethiopian 
Roads 
Authority 
(ERA), 
with 
an 
executive 
Board 
oversight, 
for 
federal 
roads 
and 
road 
sector 
policy 
implementation 
and 
coordination 
under 
the 
overall 
guidance 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Infrastructure; 
and 
(ii) 
Regional 
Roads 
Authorities 
for 
the 
regional 
roads 
within 
their 
boundaries.

Fact

1996 
To 
address 
the 
constraints 
in 
the 
road 
sector 
related 
to 
restricted 
road network 
coverage 
and 
low 
standards, 
GOE 
formulated 
a 
10-year 
Road 
Sector 
Development Program 
(RSDP, 
1997-2007). 
The 
first 
five-year 
phase 
of 
the 
program 
(RSDP 
I), 
1997-2002, 
was 
officially 
launched 
in 
September 
1997, 
and 
- 
101 
- 
Page  108
since 
then, 
both 
Government and donor-funded projects 
have 
been 
under 
implementation. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
investments, 
the 
share 
of 
federal 
roads 
in 
good 
condition 
has 
improved 
from 
14 
percent 
in 
1995 
to 
25 
percent 
in 
1999 
(Table 
2). 
Some 
improvements have 
also 
been 
realized 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
regional 
roads 
especially 
in 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
share 
of 
roads 
in 
poor 
condition.

vehicle ownership 
of 
over 
2 
vehicles 
per 
1000 
population, 
which 
is 
low 
in 
comparison 
with 
other 
SSA 
countries 
and 
is 
inadequate 
for 
satisfying the 
overall 
transport 
needs 
of 
the country. 
Out 
of 
these 
registered 
vehicles, 
about 
50 
percent 
were 
reported 
as 
having 
undergone 
mandatory vehicle 
inspections 
in 
2001102 
which 
provides 
a 
rough indication 
of 
actual utilization. 
Most 
of 
the 
vehicles 
imported 
into 
the 
country 
are 
used 
vehicles. 
Due 
to 
the 
old 
age 
and 
service 
life 
of 
the vehicles, there 
is 
a 
high 
incidence 
of 
breakdowns, 
relatively 
low 
operational 
availability and 
higher 
vehicle operation 
cost. 
Some studies 
estimate 
that 
only 
about 
70% 
of 
the 
fleet 
are 
operational at 
a 
time. 
Prior 
to 
1992, 
motorized 
transport 
services 
were 
highly 
regulated 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
tariffs 
and 
modes 
of 
operation. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
vehicle 
fleet 
in 
the 
10 
years 
before 
1992 
remained largely 
stagnant. 
Since 
1992, 
the Government 
policy 
to 
de-regulate 
services, 
encourage 
market 
competition, and tax privileges 
for 
mass 
transport 
vehicles 
has 
resulted 
in 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
fleet. 
Table 
3 
shows 
the 
high 
growth 
rate 
in 
service vehicles 
compared 
to 
cars, 
between 
1992 
and 
1998. 
The 
registered vehicle fleet 
is 
estimated 
at about 
123,000, 
representing 
37,140

Table

shows the 
total

of 
travel 
from 
1994 
to 
1999. 
The most 
striking 
feature 
in 
traffic 
flow 
trends 
is 
the 
consistent increase 
in 
total 
vehicle-kilometers 
traveled, 
particularly, 
for 
heavy 
vehicles, 
which 
is 
higher 
than 
for 
small 
vehicles. 
The 
adjusted 
aggregated 
index 
increased 
from 
88.7 
in 
1994 
to 
-

100 
in 
1996, 105.6 
in 
1998 
and 
115.3 
in 
1999. 
This 
increase 
in 
total 
vehicle 
travel 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
an 
improvement 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
road 
network, 
increase 
in 
vehicle 
fleet 
and 
greater 
utilization 
of 
trucks 
and 
buses. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
have 
been 
signs 
of 
much 
more 
efficient 
adaptation 
of 
types 
of 
trucks 
to 
types 
of 
market, 
for 
example, 
along 
the import-export corridor. 
Kilometers 
traveled 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
economy's 
growth 
potential.

The 
vehicle ownership 
is 
concentrated 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
and 
a 
few 
other 
major 
cities, 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
low 
vehicle 
supply 
is 
felt 
more 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
The 
use 
of 
motorcycles 
is 
also 
limited 
with 
the 
motorcycle 
fleet 
estimated at 
a 
total 
of 
1172 
vehicles 
(RTA 
1997/98). 
Government and 
NGO 
staff 
mainly 
use 
these 
vehicles 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Bicycles 
and 
horse-carts 
are 
also 
mainly 
in 
use 
in 
and 
around 
urban 
areas 
and 
on 
bitumen 
roads. 
As 
a 
result, 
traditional 
modes 
of 
transport 
(including 
walking, head 
loading 
and animal 
transport) have 
continued 
to 
be 
of 
great 
importance 
for 
rural 
transport, 
while motor 
vehicles 
remain 
the 
predominant mode 
in 
Ethiopia 
for 
longer 
distance 
freight 
and 
passenger 
movements. 
Pack 
animals, 
primarily 
donkeys 
and 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent 
mules, 
are 
by 
far 
the 
most 
predominant 
and 
important 
means 
of 
transport 
used 
by 
the 
rural 
households. 
The 
Village 
Level 
Travel 
and Transport 
Study 
quotes 
recent 
reviews 
of 
equine 
utilization 
in 
Ethiopia 
which 
show 
the 
population 
of 
donkeys 
as 
3.9 
million, 
mules 
1.2 
million 
and 
horses 
1.6 
million. 
Camels 
are 
also 
used 
for 
load 
carrying 
in 
some 
more 
arid 
areas 
but 
no 
data 
has 
been 
found 
on 
numbers 
or 
extent 
of 
usage. 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
(MOA) 
surveys 
in 
the 
1970s 
estimated 
that 
about 
18% 
of 
households 
owned 
donkeys 
and 
about 
5% 
mules. 
More 
recent 
reviews 
suggest 
around 
27% 
of 
the households 
own 
donkeys 
and 
12% 
mules. 
Intermediate 
modes 
of 
transport 
(IMTs) 
provide 
supporting 
services 
to 
the 
motorized 
fleet 
by 
linking 
remote 
rural 
villages 
to 
rural 
and 
urban 
markets, 
as 
well 
as 
passenger 
and 
freight 
transport 
within 
urban 
areas. 
Urban 
Transport 
and 
City 
Growth. 
Addis 
Ababa, 
with 
a 
population 
of 
about 
3.0 
million, 
is 
the 
capital 
city 
and 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
African 
Union 
and 
a 
number 
of 
international 
organizations. 
It 
is 
the 
only major 
city, 
the 
next 
largest 
urban 
center 
being 
Dire 
Dawa 
with 
a 
population 
of 
only 
250,000. 
The 
urban 
- 
103- 
Page  110
transport 
environment 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
is 
characterized 
by 
heavy 
congestion 
during 
peak 
periods, 
low 
vehicle utilization, 
weak application 
of 
traffic 
management 
measures, 
inadequate 
facilities 
for 
pedestrian 
and non-motorized 
transport 
(NMT) 
movement and 
poor road 
safety arrangements 
leading to 
high 
accidents. 
Public 
transport 
in 
the 
city 
consists 
of 
bus 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
publicly 
owned 
Anbessa 
City 
Bus 
Enterprise, 
mini 
buses 
operated 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
and conventional 
taxis. 
A 
scoping 
study 
of 
urban 
transport 
issues 
in 
Addis 
Ababa 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Urban 
Mobility 
Component 
of 
the 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa 
Transport 
Policy 
Program 
(SSATP) 
in 
October 
2002. 
According 
to 
the 
study, 
the 
motor 
vehicle ownership 
is 
low 
at 
one 
automobile 
per 
44 
persons 
(compared 
with 
39, 
and 
50 
for 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
and 
Nairobi, 
respectively). 
The 
modal 
split 
in 
the 
mid-90s 
was also 
estimated 
at 
pedestrian 
trips 
(70%), 
public 
transport 
(26%) 
and cars 
(4%). 
Inadequate 
public 
transport 
services 
have constrained 
participation 
of 
city 
residents, 
especially 
the 
poor, 
in 
economic 
activities, 
as 
well 
as 
limited 
their 
access 
to 
other 
services (health, education, 
market, 
etc). 
A 
ring 
road 
and 
associated 
road 
improvements 
are 
under 
implementation 
and 
these 
should 
help 
cross-city 
movement.  Since 
1975, 
the 
population 
and 
physical 
size 
of 
the 
city 
has 
more than 
doubled. 
Addis 
Ababa 
is 
therefore 
a 
growing 
metropolis 
that 
needs 
a 
holistic 
approach 
to 
the 
planning 
and 
provision 
of 
its 
transport 
needs. 
Railways, 
Ports 
and 
Marine 
Transport. 
A 
single 
gauge 
railway 
line 
runs 
over a 
distance 
of 
78 
1 
km 
from 
Addis 
Ababa 
to Djibouti. 
The 
Governments 
of 
Ethiopia 
and 
Djibouti 
are 
joint 
owners 
of 
the 
Chemin 
de 
Fer 
Djibouti-Ethiopian railway 
(CDE). 
At 
present, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
the 
CDE 
carries about 
700-800,000 passengers and 200-250,000 
tondyear 
(about 
2.6 
and 
3.75% 
of 
the 
total 
movement 
respectively) 
. 
The 
share 
of 
CDE 
has 
been 
declining 
over 
the 
past decade 
principally 
due 
to 
its 
weak 
ownership 
and 
management structure, 
lack 
of 
commercial orientation and 
maintenance 
resources. 
The 
CDE 
Board 
of 
Directors 
and 
the 
two 
Governments 
('joint 
owners 
of 
CDE) 
have agreed 
to 
introduce 
important institutional 
changes 
including 
the 
transfer 
of 
operation 
and 
management 
of 
the 
railway to 
a 
private 
sector concessionaire. 
The 
reduced 
access 
to 
sea 
ports 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
conflict 
with 
Eritrea 
has 
led 
to 
the 
predominant 
use 
of 
the 
Djibouti 
port, and 
this 
has 
prompted 
the 
Government 
to 
explore the 
use 
of 
other potential, 
but 
less 
used 
ports 
(including 
Berbera, 
Port 
Sudan 
and 
Mombassa). 
However, 
the 
economic 
feasibility 
for 
the 
use 
of 
these 
ports 
needs 
to 
be 
firmly 
established 
with 
due 
consideration 
for 
the 
sources 
of 
supply 
and 
demand 
for 
import-export 
goods, 
and 
the 
potential 
high 
costs 
of 
transporting 
over 
long 
distances 
and 
the 
associated 
transport 
regulations 
and 
security 
requirements. 
A 
national 
merchant 
marine, 
the 
Ethiopian 
Shipping 
Lines 
(ESL) consisting 
of 
twelve 
ships 
and 
vessels 
with 
gross 
and 
net 
registered 
tonnage 
of 
over 
100,000 
and 
50,000, 
respectively,  and 
operate 
along 
routes 
to 
western Europe, 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
far 
east. 
Civil 
Aviation. 
Civil 
aviation 
plays 
a 
more significant 
role 
in 
the 
transport 
sector 
of 
Ethiopia 
than 
in 
most 
developing 
countries 
because 
of 
the 
limited 
road 
infrastructure 
( 
rugged 
terrain 
and 
long 
journey 
times). 
The 
civil 
aviation 
sector 
has 
an 
extensive 
infrastructure 
with 
two 
international 
airports 
(Bole 
airport 
at 
Addis 
Ababa, 
and 
Dire 
Dawa), 
seven 
major 
domestic airports, 
and 
over 
30 
other 
domestic 
airports 
and airstrips. 
The 
national 
airlines, 
with 
a 
commercial 
fleet 
of 
about 
25 carriers, 
provides 
regular 
scheduled 
domestic 
air 
services 
to 
32 
points, 
with 
the 
remainder 
being 
served 
by 
charter 
flights 
operated 
by 
private 
carriers. 
There 
are 
five 
private national 
operators 
licensed, 
two 
of 
which 
have already started 
operations. 
Internationally, 
Ethiopian 
Airlines 
not only 
provides 
a service 
to/from Ethiopia 
but 
has 
also 
developed a 
highly 
successful 
hub 
and 
spoke 
operation connecting 
49 
international 
destinations 
in 
Asia, 
Europe 
and 
USA, 
and Eastern 
Africa 
with 
Southern 
and 
West 
Africa: 
about 60 
- 
65 
percent 
of 
international 
passengers, 
handled 
at 
Bole 
airport 
are 
in 
transit 
for 
other 
destinations. 
From 
its 
international 
operations, 
Ethiopian 
Airlines 
generates 
significant 
foreign 
exchange 
earnings 
for 
the 
economy.

Subject: 
Ethiopian Letter 
of 
Road 
Sector 
Policy 
Dear 
iMr. 
Madavo, 
I 
am 
writing 
this 
policy 
letter 
to draw your 
attention 
and 
Ethiopia’s 
development 
partners 
especially 
in 
the 
road 
sector 
to 
the 
on-going efforts 
in 
designing 
and 
implementing 
instruments 
to promote 
the 
required 
institutional, procedural 
and 
policy 
changes 
as 
part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
facilitating 
an 
enabling environment 
for 
the 
second phase 
of 
the 
Road 
Sector 
Development 
Program. 
As 
you 
all 
recall, 
in 
early 
1990s, 
Ethiopia’s classified 
road 
network 
was 
limited 
to about 
23,000 
lulometers, 
of 
which 
about 
75 
percent 
was 
rated 
as 
poor condtion. 
Faced 
with 
this 
situation, the Government 
gave greater emphasis 
on 
improving 
the 
main 
road 
network 
and 
regonal 
rural 
road 
access 
to 
meet 
the 
agricultural 
and 
other socio-economic 
development 
needs 
of 
the country. 
The 
Government 
then 
proceeded 
with 
the preparation 
of 
the 
ten-year 
Road 
Sector 
Development Program 
(RSDP). 
The 
frst 
phase 
of 
the 
RSDP 
(1997-2002) 
is 
a 
culmination 
of 
the 
Government’s efforts, 
with 
significant 
support 
from 
the 
donor 
community, 
to 
create 
adequate 
capacity 
in 
the 
road 
sub 
sector 
to 
facilitate 
and 
hasten 
the 
economic 
recovery 
process and 
restore the essential 
road 
networks to 
acceptable 
condition. The Program 
that 
was 
launched 
in 
July 
1997, 
covered 
measures 
aimed 
at: 
(i) 
creating 
a conducive 
atmosphere 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
road 
sector 
throw& 
introducing 
a 
series 
of 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms, 
and 
(ii) 
rehabilitating 
critical 
roads that 
have 
been 
identified 
as 
major 
impediments towards 
the attainment 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Economic 
Recovery Program. 
In 
this 
regard, the 
rehabilitation 
of 
trunk 
roads 
and 
the 
upgrading 
of 
key 
link 
roads 
have 
been 
accorded 
highest 
priority 
as 
they had 
proved 
to 
be 
major 
impediments 
to 
the 
evacuation 
of 
crops, 
the 
delivery 
of 
agricultural 
inputs, 
and 
access 
to 
ports. 
This 
is 
now 
even 
more 
clear 
and reflected 
in 
Government’s 
Sustainable 
Development 
and 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Program 
approved 
for 
implementation 
in 
2002.

As 
it 
is 
clear 
for 
development partners 
most 
of 
the 
policy 
issues 
have 
been 
identified 
in 
the 
course 
of 
formulation 
of 
the 
RSDP. 
The 
subsequent 
discussions 
between 
the 
relevant 
authorities 
in 
the Government 
and 
Donors 
staff 
provided 
good 
opportunity 
for 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
expected 
overall 
commitment 
in 
establishing 
policy 
goals. 
It 
is 
with 
this 
background 
that 
the context 
of 
the 
policy reform 
was 
determined, 
designed 
and 
implemented. Indeed, 
the 
administrative complexities 
of 
policy 
changes are 
obvious 
and 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to monitor 
and 
re-design 
the 
appropriate 
instruments 
in 
the 
course 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP. 
Implementation 
of 
RSDP 
I 
1. 
During 
the 
proceedings 
of 
the 
conference and thereafter, 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
European 
Union, 
the 
African 
Development Bank, 
the 
Nordic 
Development 
Fund, 
OPEC 
Fund, 
BADEA, 
the 
Governments 
of 
Japan, 
Germany, 
Italy, 
U.K., 
Ireland, Sweden 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia 
and 
Road 
Users 
pledged 
financial 
support 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
the Program. 
A 
Donor’s 
conference 
was 
held 
in 
January 
1996 
to solicit 
funding 
for 
the 
RSDP. 
2 
. 
implementation 
of 
88 
% 
of 
the 
Program 
(as 
revised 
during 
the 
RSDP 
I 
Mid-term 
Review) 
with 
a 
corresponding 
disbursement 
rate 
of 
77 
%. 
All 
in 
all, 
Birr 
7,115 
million 
(US$ 
8 
18.0 
million) 
has 
been 
disbursed 
during 
RSDP 
I. 
Judged against 
the 
established 
objectives and 
benchmarks 
the 
overall 
performance 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I 
has 
been 
satisfactory. Substantial 
progress has 
been achieved 
in 
re-opening 
nearly 
all 
of 
the 
classified 
roads, 
accessibility 
has 
been 
improved 
and 
the 
percentage 
of 
roads 
in 
good condition 
has 
also 
increased 
although 
not 
as 
much 
as 
anticipated. 
At 
the 
same 
time, substantial progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
and 
in 
securing 
the 
required 
levels 
of 
funding 
for 
maintenance and 
capital 
works; a 
very 
positive 
development compared 
to 
the 
previous 
decades. 
It 
is 
the 
belief 
of 
the 
Government 
that 
we 
should 
take 
confidence 
from 
the 
gains 
made 
to 
date 
and 
move forward 
in 
implementing 
the 
Program 
in 
order 
to 
realize the 
full 
potential 
benefits anticipated 
by 
the 
various 
stakeholders 
during 
the 
Program 
formulation. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
RSDP 
ended 
in 
June 
2002 
with 
overall physical 
General Appraisal

. 
In 
general, 
the 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
introduced 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Federal Democratic Republic 
of 
Ethiopia 
has 
facilitated 
the 
implementation 
of 
phase 
one 
of 
RSDP. 
Several 
rehabilitation 
projects 
are 
currently 
under 
implementation, 
and 
progress 
is 
to 
be 
expedited 
as 
contractors 
improve their 
management, 
programming and 
resource 
utilization. 
Of 
course, 
certain 
shortcomings 
do 
occur, 
which 
necessitate 
the 
revision 
of 
schedules. 
ERA’S 
administrative capacity 
has also 
been 
enhanced 
following 
institutional 
restructuring 
and accompanying 
measures.

capital 
invested 
in 
the 
road 
network. 
This 
together 
with 
the 
more effective 
enforcement 
of 
axle 
loads, 
the 
gradual 
contracting out 
of 
periodic 
maintenance 
and 
the 
commercialization 
of 
maintenance 
districts 
will 
have considerable 
influence 
in 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
road 
sector. 
Overall 
this 
should 
support government’s 
effort 
to 
stabilize 
the 
economy 
and 
meet 
the 
challenges 
of 
poverty 
reduction. 
The Road 
Fund 
has 
helped 
to 
address 
major 
shortcomings 
in 
protecting

. 
Indeed, 
the 
success 
towards 
achieving 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
objectives 
depends 
upon 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
and 
the 
timely 
start-up 
of 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
RSDP. Rehabilitation, upgrading 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
existing 
network 
will 
continue 
to 
become 
a dominant feature 
of 
RSDP 
11. 
In 
view 
of 
a 
low 
road 
density 
substantial 
expansion 
of 
the 
network 
will 
also 
be 
required 
to 
support 
the 
economic 
development 
of 
the 
country. 
This 
is 
critical 
in 
increasing 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
and 
providing 
exports, 
raising 
incomes 
and 
improving food 
security. 
Related 
to 
this 
is 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Ethiopia 
Rural 
Travel 
and Transport 
sub- 
Program, 
which 
is 
viewed 
as 
a 
key 
intervention 
in 
support 
of 
the 
government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
rural 
development 
strategies. 
6 
. 
The 
Government,  however, 
believes 
that 
implementation 
of 
policy 
reforms 
is 
a 
continuing 
process, 
and 
is 
actively focusing 
on 
their 
implementation. 
As 
is 
clearly 
demonstrated 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
is 
now 
well 
underway. 
7 
. 
partial 
implementation 
would 
fail 
to 
yield 
the 
full 
potential 
benefits 
agreed 
among 
different 
stakeholders. 
Rehabilitation 
of 
the 
existing 
limited 
paved 
trunk 
road network 
and 
provision 
of 
funds 
for 
minimum 
maintenance alone 
will 
not 
ensure sustained 
protection 
of 
the 
network 
as 
a 
whole. That 
means 
without 
continuing 
investments 
in 
follow on 
projects included 
under 
RSDP, transport 
costs 
will 
remain 
high, 
and 
movement 
of 
agricultural 
inputs 
and 
outputs 
will 
continue 
to 
suffer. 
The 
investment 
and 
policy 
reforms 
in 
the 
road 
sector 
need 
to 
be 
continued 
since 
a 
The 
Second 
Phase 
of 
RSDP 
8. 
It 
has 
been realized 
that progress 
has 
been 
less 
than 
hoped, 
especially 
in 
projects, 
which 
were 
not 
started 
in 
the 
initial 
period 
of 
the 
Program. 
In 
particular, 
stakeholders 
have 
raised 
concerns 
about 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Program 
vis-&vis 
the 
implementation 
capacity 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and more 
critically 
the 
financial 
requirement 
of 
the 
Program 
on 
the 
other. 
The 
lessons 
learned 
have 
led 
to 
a 
critical 
examination 
of 
the 
whole 
planning 
and 
programming 
of 
the 
program. 
As 
a 
result 
the 
second phase 
of 
RSDP 
has 
been 
drafted 
with 
two 
scenarios: 
The 
RSDP 
I1 
basic 
program 
(low 
scenario) envisages: 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
1,014 
km, 
the 
upgrading 
of 
1,864 
km, 
the 
construction 
of 
5,693 
km, 
including 
low-class 
roads 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
comprehensive 
policy 
and 
institutional reforms 
that commenced 
during 
RSDP 
I. 
In 
addition, 
it 
includes 
heavy 
and 
routine 
maintenance 
in 
several 
types 
of 
roads, 
bridges 
works 
and 
studies 
for 
follow-on 
operation. 
The 
program 
is 
estimated 
to 
cost 
Birr 
12,898.9 
million 
(US$ 
1,482.6 
million). 
The 
estimated 
cost 
of 
the 
enhanced 
program 
(high 
scenario) 
for 
RSDP 
I1 
is 
about 
Birr 
14,550 
million 
(US$ 
1,673 
million); 
13 
% 
higher 
than 
the 
basic 
program. 
The 
high 
scenario 
involves 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
1168 
km, 
the 
upgrading 
of 
2045 
km 
and 
the 
construction 
of 
8383 
km 
of 
roads. 
9. 
A 
regular annual 
assessment 
of 
the 
RSDP 
budget 
is 
also 
to 
be 
carried out 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
overall 
macroeconomic 
environment and 
under 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy. 
Through 
this 
process 
the 
implementation 
rate 
of 
RSDP 
will 
be 
geared 
to 
the 
pace 
of 
macro-economic 
growth 
and 
a 
medium-term 
public 
expenditure 
framework 
to 
maintain fiscal 
sustainability 
of 
increased 
public 
expenditures.

major policy 
and 
institutional reforms 
that 
will 
make the 
investments 
in 
the 
road 
sector sustainable 
in 
the 
long-term. 
These 
reforms 
have 
now 
been directed 
towards 
ensuring 
adequate 
hnding 
for 
maintenance, 
increasing 
the 
capacity 
of 
ERA 
in 
areas 
of 
contract 
administration,  design and the increased 
use 
of 
domestic 
private 
contractors. 
Many 
of 
these 
policy

been 
implemented over 
the 
last 
few 
years 
and 
further 
concrete 
actions 
will 
be taken 
to effectively

RSDP 
in

conclusions reached among 
stakeholders 
at 
different 
times 
in 
the 
course 
of 
implementing

which 
has 
become an obstacle 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of

program, 
and 
to 
develop 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
road 
agencies 
to 
properly 
manage 
the 
networks. 
In 
addition to 
the 
infrastructure 
provision, 
the 
Program 
contributes 
to 
economic 
development 
by 
providing 
economic 
opportunity 
for 
the 
rural 
poor, 
creating employment 
in 
both rural 
road 
works and 
the 
development 
of 
appropriate 
and affordable 
means 
of 
transport. 
The 
second phase 
of 
the 
RSDP, 
like 
the 
first 
one, 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
economic 
policy 
of 
the 
country. 
It 
is 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Agricultural 
Development 
Led-Industrialization 
policy 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
food 
sufficiency, 
poverty 
alleviation, 
and assisting

objective 
of 
improving 
and 
expanding 
the 
road network 
so 
that 
it 
can 
enlarge 
social 
service coverage 
in 
the 
country.

The 
objective 
of

is 
to

Autonomy 
of 
ERA: 
The autonomy 
of 
ERA 
has 
been 
confirmed 
since 
the 
launching 
of 
the 
RSDP 
I 
and 
full 
responsibility 
has 
been 
given 
to 
ERA 
to 
take 
final 
decisions and make recommendations 
on 
matters 
related 
to 
the 
Road 
Sector 
in 
exercising 
its 
responsibilities and 
duties. 
ERA’S 
management 
is 
evaluated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
its 
annual 
work 
program 
in 
accordance 
with 
management 
controlled 
performance 
indicators. 
In 
this 
regard, 
ERA 
has 
been 
unequivocally given 
the 
authority 
and autonomy 
for 
day-to-day contract 
management 
(e.g. 
contractual 
progress payments 
to 
contractors 
following 
certification 
by 
the 
Engineers), 
as 
well 
as 
for 
prompt 
decisions 
on 
problems 
identified on 
site 
including 
readily 
endorsing 
and 
approving variation 
orders 
as 
required. 
Moreover, 
the 
Government 
has 
empowered 
ERA 
and 
its 
Board 
to give 
final 
decisions 
on 
award 
of 
contracts, 
procurement 
of 
goods, services

An 
important 
component 
of

District 
Maintenance 
Organizations, 
which 
will 
be 
a 
separate 
entity 
after

Institutional 
and Capacity 
Strengthening 
of 
Road 
Authorities: 
The 
provision 
of 
adequate 
program 
management 
capacity 
has 
been 
recognized 
as 
a 
critical 
issue 
which 
the 
Government 
is 
taking 
steps 
to 
address 
prior 
to, 
and 
during 
implementation 
of 
the 
RSDP. 
In 
this 
regard, 
following 
ERA’S 
reform 
and 
strengthening 
needs 
study, 
the 
new 
organizational 
structure 
was adopted, 
and 
a 
new 
salary 
scale 
has 
been 
approved 
in 
June 
1997 
for 
ERA 
staff. 
At 
the 
moment 
ERA 
is 
revisiting 
the 
reform 
study 
mainly 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
revised 
salary 
scale 
in 
Civil 
Service 
Commission 
and propose a 
new 
salary 
scale 
so 
as 
to retain 
its 
professionals. 
As 
with 
ERA, 
there 
is 
an 
on-going 
process 
to implement 
the 
reform 
study 
of 
the 
Regional 
State 
Rural 
Roads 
Authorities 
(RRAs) 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
Rural 
Roads 
Technical 
Support 
Branch 
within 
ERA 
has 
been 
strengthened 
to 
provide 
needed 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training to 
RRAs. 
In 
addition 
ERA 
will 
continue 
using 
the 
assistance 
being 
provided 
by 
donor 
partners 
on 
the 
identified 
technical 
assistance 
in 
areas 
of 
donors’ 
coordination, 
contract administration, 
planning, 
maintenance, 
rural 
roads, 
financial 
management, 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
program. 
These 
positions 
have 
been 
progressively 
tilled 
since 
March 
1997 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
these 
TAs 
has 
been 
substantial 
and positive. 
As 
a 
result 
ERA 
has 
demonstrated 
improved 
capacity 
in 
the execution 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
RSDP. 
However, the 
task 
of 
establishing 
the 
District 
Maintenance 
Organizations 
as 
fully 
commercial 
units 
remains 
an 
important 
milestone 
in 
the 
reform 
of 
ERA 
under 
RSDP 
II. 
16. 
The 
Government, however, 
realized 
that 
as 
ERA 
moves 
towards preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
second phase 
of 
the RSDP, 
the 
capacity 
of 
ERA 
would 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
more especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
contract 
management 
and design reviews. 
ERA 
has 
prepared a 
technical 
assistance 
project 
for 
submission 
to 
donors 
for 
developing 
in-house capacity 
to 
prepare 
and administer 
contracts 
for 
construction, maintenance and 
services 
of 
both 
ERA 
and 
RRAs, 
on 
a 
scale 
sufficient 
to 
implement 
the 
RSDP efficiently. 
17. 
Government 
established 
the 
Road 
Fund 
as 
a 
source 
of 
adequate assured 
maintenance 
funding 
and 
by 
statute has 
allocated 
fuel 
levies 
and 
Sales 
Tax 
on 
fuel 
for 
this 
purpose 
and 
has 
ensured 
that the transfers 
to 
the 
Road 
Fund 
are 
made 
fully 
and 
promptly. 
The 
Government 
intends 
to 
study 
the 
practical 
modalities 
of 
moving 
to 
a 
full 
road-user 
charge 
system, 
including 
the 
possibility 
of 
identifying 
other 
sources 
of 
road 
financing, and 
the 
macro-economic 
implication 
of 
alternative 
financing 
options. 
In 
the 
mean 
time 
every 
effort 
will 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
that 
funding 
levies 
are 
sufficient 
for 
full 
funding 
of 
routine 
maintenance 
and 
an increasing 
share 
of 
periodic 
maintenance. 
The goal 
is 
to 
attain 
financial self-sufficiency 
in 
all 
maintenance 
activities 
by 
the 
end 
of

The 
Road 
Fund 
has 
given 
ERA, 
RRAs 
and 
municipalities 
an 
assured source 
of 
revenue 
for road 
maintenance, 
primarily 
from 
a 
dedicated 
surcharge 
on 
fuel. 
The 
Fund 
raised 
a 
sum 
of 
over 
Birr 
1.3 
billion 
up 
to 
December 
2002, 
with 
a 
level 
of 
disbursement 
of 
about 
Birr 
887.0 
million. 
It 
can 
be 
realized 
from 
the 
above 
Table that the 
forecasted 
revenue 
from 
the 
Road 
Fund 
and 
the 
contribution 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
under the 
Emergency 
Recovery Program 
matches 
the 
maintenance 
need showing 
the 
sustainability 
and 
stable 
flow 
of 
fund 
over 
time. 
19. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
talung 
measures 
to 
improve road 
maintenance 
planning, 
programming and budgeting 
as 
well 
as 
managerial 
accountability. 
As 
a 
whole, the 
Governments’ 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
accounting 
of 
road 
sector 
institutions 
and 
to 
improve 
public 
expenditure planning, 
with 
emphasis 
on 
core 
program 
has 
been an 
essential aspect 
of 
strengthening the budget 
process. 
20. 
Commercialization 
of 
the force 
account 
of 
ERA: 
The institutional 
reform 
led 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
ERA 
as 
an autonomous 
organization 
with 
a 
clear 
focus 
on 
planning, 
contract 
management, 
road 
maintenance and 
monitoring 
functions. 
The 
reform 
has 
also 
involved 
the transformation 
of 
ERA 
from 
a 
centrally controlled, direct 
labor 
oriented 
organization 
to 
a 
decentralized 
one, 
with 
significant 
changes 
in 
staff 
rationalization, 
performance contracting 
and commercial 
accounting, 
as 
part 
of 
continuous goveminent 
activity 
aimed 
at 
gradual Corportization. 
21. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
effort 
a 
five-year

to 
cover 
ERA’S 
ten 
District 
Maintenance 
Organizations 
(DMOs). 
The overall objective 
of 
this 
project 
is 
to 
strengthen the 
DMOs 
so 
that 
they 
can 
undertake 
cost 
effective 
road 
maintenance 
and 
thus 
be 
able 
to 
complete 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
on 
equal 
terms. 
To 
achieve 
this 
objective 
a 
series 
of 
steps are 
envisaged: 
.................................................................

Note 
that 
the estimated 
costs 
are 
on 
a 
full

Firstly, 
the 
DMOs 
will 
be 
started 
to 
operate 
as 
Cost 
Centers 
in 
July 
2003. 
This 
is 
aimed 
at 
encouraging effective 
asset 
utilization 
and 
management, 
the 
elimination 
of 
waste, 
better 
cost 
control 
and 
productivity; 
b) 
Secondly, 
the 
Cost 
Centers 
will 
be 
changed 
into Profit 
Centers. 
This 
will 
change 
the 
management 
emphasis 
from 
controlling 
costs 
to 
making 
a 
profit. 
The 
operation 
of 
Profit 
Centers 
is 
scheduled 
to 
start 
in 
July 
2005; 
and 
c 
) 
Thirdly, 
the 
Profit 
Centers 
will 
be 
turned 
into 
Commercial 
Entities 
(by 
July 
2006) 
to 
manage 
their 
own 
business 
strategy 
and 
decision-making. 
At 
this 
stage 
all 
DMOs 
function 
as 
commercial 
units, 
delivering 
cost 
effective 
maintenance services 
within 
a 
framework 
of 
internal 
performance 
agreements. 
22. 
agreement 
whereby 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
control 
of 
maintenance 
activity 
of 
each 
District 
is 
supervised 
by 
engineers 
designated 
outside 
of 
the Operations Department 
of 
ERA. 
In 
the 
mean 
time 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
measures 
will 
be 
introduced 
which 
include: 
New 
management 
procedures 
and 
systems 
(covering 
cost 
accounting, 
finance, 
road 
maintenance, 
stock 
control, 
procurement, 
performance 
management 
and 
personnel), 
contract procedures 
(for 
the 
management 
of 
labor 
only 
contracts), 
training 
of 
district 
of 
personnel, 
installation 
of 
computer hardware and 
systems 
software 
will 
be 
introduced. 
In 
order 
to 
carry out 
these 
three 
stages 
ERA 
has 
already developed 
an 
internal 
23. 
Village 
Level Travel 
and 
Transport 
Study, 
which 
revealed 
the 
seriousness 
of 
transport 
burden 
of 
the 
rural 
population, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
design 
a 
program 
for 
rural 
travel 
and transport 
to 
address 
problems 
of 
access 
to 
facilities 
and 
services. 
The 
Government believes 
that 
the 
ERTTP 
will 
form 
an 
essential component 
of 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
rural 
development 
strategies, 
which 
re-affirm 
the 
government’s 
direction 
in 
meeting 
the 
central 
challenge 
of 
improving 
living 
conditions 
in 
rural 
areas, 
with 
special 
emphasis 
on 
agricultural 
production, 
economic 
and 
social infrastructure. The 
program 
has 
been 
developed 
specifically 
to 
address 
interventions that 
can 
be 
tackled 
by 
the 
decentralized 
local 
government 
structures 
at 
Woreda and 
kebele 
level.

of 
Woreda 
Travel 
and Transport Plans 
(WTTP) 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
same 
is 
a comer 
stone 
of 
the 
process. 
Each 
Woreda 
will 
have 
its 
own 
WTTP 
delivered through 
their 
participation 
in 
the 
light 
of 
local 
authorities 
development plans. 
This 
is 
expected 
to 
have a 
very 
positive contribution 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
the 
integrated 
transport 
system 
that 
the 
country 
wants 
to 
see. 
The 
strategies 
will 
include 
the 
construction 
of 
low-level 
rural 
roads, 
the 
provision 
and 
expansion 
of 
both 
conventional 
and 
intermediate 
means 
of 
transport, 
and 
the expansion 
and 
improvement 
of

arc 
subjected 
to 
rigorous 
technical, 
financial, 
economic, 
socio-cultural 
and 
environmental investigation. 
Crucial 
to project 
formulation 
is 
the 
economic 
feasibility, 
which 
has 
to 
show at least 
an 
Economic Internal 
Rate 
of 
Return 
of 
10 
percent, 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of

There 
are 
also 
other 
considerations 
in 
priority 
ranking, 
role 
of 
strategic

in 
the 
network, contribution 
to

other development objectives, 
In 
this 
regard,

has 
been 
completed 
by

As 
part 
of 
the. 
assignment, 
new

have 
been 
identified 
and evaluated 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
future 
road

development. 
26. 
As 
for 
rural 
roads, 
ERA 
is 
advising Regional 
Authorities 
to 
effectively 
structure 
the 
identification, formulation 
and implementation 
of 
their 
projects. 
There 
is 
a 
consensus 
that 
greater 
development impact 
can 
be 
ensured 
by 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
projects/programs 
by 
means 
of 
better 
project 
identification 
and 
preparation. 
Related 
to 
this 
is 
the 
increased 
awareness 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
integrating road 
investment 
programs 
into 
regional 
inter 
sectoral 
plans. 
Additionally, project

shall 
also 
be 
given 
due 
consideration 
in 
the 
planning 
and 
design 
of 
road 
projects. 
A 
basis 
is 
also 
laid 
to 
establish a 
National 
Road 
Safety 
Board. 
The 
Road 
Transport 
Authority 
(RTA) 
will 
be 
the 
main 
responsible 
body 
for 
road 
safety 
activities 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
An 
Interim 
Working 
Group 
including 
representatives 
from 
ERA, 
the 
RTA, 
the 
Road 
Fund 
and 
the 
Federal 
Police 
has 
been 
set 
up 
to 
coordinate 
and 
initiate 
work 
in 
this 
area. 
As 
the 
monitoring 
report 
for 
RSDP points out 
vividly, 
a 
rise 
in 
total 
casualties

and introduced incentives through 
tax 
exemptions 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
road 
transport 
services. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
fleet 
of 
commercial 
vehicles, 
both 
freight 
and 
passenger has 
gone 
up 
significantly. 
The 
deregulation 
process has 
led 
to 
greater 
competition 
between 
transport 
operators.

The Government 
has 
also 
introduced 
measures 
in 
improving 
the 
market 
and 
competitive environment 
by 
defining 
the roles 
of 
public 
transport 
enterprises. 
Individual 
public 
enterprises 
have 
been 
down 
sized, 
their 
objectives 
set 
and 
their 
performances 
evaluated. 
Improvements 
have also 
been 
made 
in 
accounting 
and 
financial 
auditing. 
As 
complete 
privatization 
has 
taken 
much 
time 
to plan 
and 
implement 
than 
initially 
anticipated, 
the 
reforming 
of 
these 
enterprises 
has 
contributed to 
the 
general 
improvement 
of 
the 
market 
environment. 
32. 
Increasing 
Capacity 
of 
Local 
Private 
Contractors: 
The 
Government believes 
that the 
sustainability 
of 
measures 
to 
be 
undertaken 
under 
the 
RSDP 
will 
depend, 
to 
a 
great extent, 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
domestic 
construction 
industry, 
which 
is 
now 
reemerging

under 
RSDP, 
after 
years 
of 
stagnation 
and almost non-existence 
in 
road 
subsector 
activities. 
The 
Government 
has, 
as 
one 
of 
its 
stated 
objectives, 
the 
encouragement 
of 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
road 
maintenance 
and 
construction 
program. 
Force 
account

growing 
industry 
as 
it 
emerges 
from 
a 
period 
of 
stagnation. Indeed, 
a 
few 
major 
contractors 
would 
appear 
well 
placed 
to 
expand 
their 
activities, 
both 
in 
periodic 
maintenance 
and 
increasingly 
in 
construction 
projects. However, 
many 
contractors face 
particular 
obstacles 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
finance, 
commercial 
management, 
project 
management 
and 
acquisition 
of 
heavy 
equipment, 
which 
need 
to 
be 
addressed. 
Specific 
activities 
are 
being 
introduced 
in 
RSDP 
II 
to 
assist 
these 
contractors 
through training 
and 
procurement programs. 
The 
use 
of 
long-term 
level-of-service  maintenance contracts 
is 
being 
considered 
as 
these 
contracts can 
provide 
emerging 
firms 
with 
a suitable 
continuity 
of 
work 
to 
finance 
equipment 
purchase. 
At 
present, 
the 
domestic 
road 
construction 
services sector 
is

These 
include 
enhancing 
the 
development 
of 
local 
contractors 
and 
consultants 
by 
offering 
training,  and 
involving 
them 
more 
in 
road 
works

and 
reforming 
the 
contract 
documents 
of 
Government 
financed projects 
as 
required, 
and 
facilitating 
the 
establishment 
of 
equipment

companies. 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
further 
facilitate 
the development 
of 
the 
industry 
based 
on 
the 
findings 
and 
recommendation 
from 
the 
Domestic Construction 
Industry 
study. 
Under 
the RSDP

further 
measures 
will 
be taken 
to 
strengthen 
the

only 
in 
constructiodupgrading works 
but 
also 
in 
maintenance 
works. 
Contractors 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
routine 
maintenance 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
RSDP 
11, 
whereas 
their 
involvement 
in 
periodic 
maintenance 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
to 
more 
than 
90% 
(in 
2006/07) 
from 
the 
current 
28%. 
Specific 
capacity 
building 
initiative 
is 
also 
underway 
to 
further 
facilitate 
the 
involvement 
of 
local 
contractors. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Government 
will 
waive 
(i) 
bid 
security, 
substituting 
it 
with 
other 
penalty 
to 
bidders 
failing 
to honor 
a 
bid; 
and 
(ii) 
performance 
bonds, 
to 
be 
substituted 
with 
the 
retention 
money. 
The 
Government 
will 
also 
facilitate 
the 
access 
to 
advance 
payments

provided 
by 
the 
local 
banks, 
for 
those 
domestic contractors that 
are 
awarded 
the 
contracts, based 
on 
submission 
of(i) 
a signed 
contract 
with 
the 
Government; 
(ii) 
an 
account 
maintained 
by 
the 
contractor 
in 
the 
bank 
providing 
the 
guarantee, and 
(iii) 
a 
formal 
letter 
from 
the 
govemment 
confirming 
that 
the 
advance 
payment 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
contract 
would 
be 
deposited 
in 
the 
contractor’s 
account 
held 
with 
the 
same 
bank 
upon 
receipt 
of 
guarantee 
from 
the 
bank 
provided 
the 
contractor 
has 
a 
good financial 
standing 
with

Social 
and 
Environmental 
Considerations. 
In 
both 
phases 
of 
RSDP 
the 
Government 
is 
not 
just 
concerned 
with 
roads 
and 
transport 
costs 
but 
also 
concerned 
with 
the social 
effects, 
A 
particular 
issue 
for main 
road 
development 
is 
the 
question 
of 
the 
possible 
disruption 
caused 
to 
communities 
living 
along 
the 
line 
of 
the 
road. 
For 
this 
reason 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
attention 
is 
given 
to 
resettlement 
issues 
and 
resettlement 
plans 
which 
are 
an 
important 
component 
of 
our planning. 
37. 
An 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
and 
Safety 
Branch 
whose 
part 
of 
its 
responsibilities 
cover, among other 
things, 
the 
development 
of 
a Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plans 
has 
continuously 
been 
strengthened. 
ERA 
has 
recently undertaken social 
impact 
assessments 
of 
a 
number 
of 
roads 
that 
help 
understand 
how 
communities 
may 
respond 
to 
the 
new 
road 
investments 
and 
to 
see 
how 
livelihoods 
of 
particular 
groups 
will 
be 
affected. 
A 
“Road 
Corridor 
and 
Poverty 
Impact” 
study 
is 
shortly 
to 
be commissioned 
that 
should 
help 
understand 
better 
the 
relationship 
between 
road 
investment and 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
poor. 
The 
Program 
also 
addresses 
a 
variety 
of 
social 
objectives 
including road 
safety, 
environmental protection, 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
and 
mitigation. 
38. 
Program 
Coordination and 
Monitoring: 
The 
RSDP 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
managed 
and implemented 
by 
ERA 
(together 
with 
rural road 
inputs 
from 
the 
Regions), 
the 
legally 
autonomous 
road 
management agency, 
and 
its 
line 
departments 
and 
district offices 
under 
the 
General Manager. 
ERA’s 
organization 
has 
three 
main 
departments 
as 
follows: 
(A) 
Engineering and 
Regulatory 
Department, 
which 
is 
to 
discharge 
the 
responsibilities 
through four 
Divisions 
of 
(i) 
planning 
and 
programming, 
(ii) 
contracts 
implementation, 
(iii) 
network 
management; 
and 
(iv) 
engineering 
services 
procurement, 
design 
and 
technical 
support 
(B) 
Operations Department, 
which 
is 
to 
discharge 
responsibilities 
for 
force 
account maintenance, emergency 
road 
construction 
and 
maintenance, associated 
logistics 
support; 
and 
(C) 
Human 
Resource and 
Finance 
Department. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
broad 
organizational 
setup 
for 
implementing 
the 
RSDP, 
ERA 
has 
a 
program 
advisory 
office 
(PAO) under 
the 
General 
Manager 
supported 
by 
TA 
comprising RSDP 
Advisor 
for 
program 
coordination, 
advice, 
including 
the 
coordination 
of 
road 
related multi-donor 
support 
and 
interests. 
To 
facilitate 
the 
monitoring 
functions, 
the 
Inspectorate 
Unit, 
which 
will 
continue 
as 
part of 
ERA’s 
normal 
organizational 
unit, 
has 
also 
been 
performing 
technical 
and 
financial 
audits 
to 
ensure 
the 
timely 
implementation 
of 
directives and report 
its 
findings 
to 
the 
Board. 
It 
is 
also 
providing 
suitable advice 
to 
ERA 
management 
for 
action. 
39. 
The 
Government 
has 
already 
recognized 
the 
need 
to improve 
the 
identification 
and 
monitoring 
of 
projects 
and 
the 
evaluation 
of 
their 
development 
impact, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to RSDP 
objectives, 
institutional 
requirements 
and 
implementation 
risks 
mitigation. 
A 
monitoring 
system 
for 
the 
RSDP 
has 
been

to draw 
lessons 
from 
the 
view 
points 
of 
benefits 
and 
sustainability. 
ERA’S 
management 
is 
particularly 
focusing 
on 
introducing 
measures 
in 
overcoming capacity 
constraints 
in 
road 
maintenance 
with 
much 
more 
emphasis 
on 
promoting 
the 
role 
of 
the 
private 
sector.

Risks 
Involved 
in 
the 
Implementation 
of 
the Program: 
The 
political 
and 
economic 
risks 
are 
low. 
The 
Government 
is 
totally 
committed 
to 
this 
program and 
hence 
problems 
that 
could 
arise 
in 
implementation 
is 
being 
dealt 
with 
an 
efficient 
and 
flexible 
manner. 
Institutional 
and 
policy 
reforms 
have 
been 
taken 
to 
enhance 
the 
existing 
capacity 
of 
ERA 
coupled 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Road 
Fund 
that 
provides 
funds 
for 
maintenance expenditures 
and 
lay 
the 
basis 
for 
a sustainable 
road 
maintenance program. 
If 
revenues 
from 
user 
charges 
accruing 
to 
the 
Road 
Fund 
fall 
below 
projections, 
which 
are 
to 
be 
reviewed 
annually, the 
shortfall 
will 
be 
met 
by 
increasing Government 
contributions 
to 
the 
Fund 
so 
as 
to 
obtain 
the 
required 
maintenance 
expenditure 
level. 
Should overall 
budgetary 
constraints 
occw 
to 
limit 
these 
contributions, 
priority 
will 
be 
given 
to 
maintenance 
over 
new 
investments. 
In 
conclusion, 
the 
Government realizes that 
although 
substantial 
progress 
has 
been 
achieved when 
ERA 
acts 
as 
the 
champion 
of 
change, 
the 
implementation 
of 
policy 
reforms 
would 
be 
complex 
as 
they 
involve 
many 
other 
ministries 
and 
agencies, Serious 
effort 
will 
be 
exerted 
to 
bring 
these 
ministries/agencies 
to 
the 
same 
level 
of 
change 
to 
keep the 
momentum. 
To 
this 
end 
the 
Government 
look 
forward 
to 
the 
continued 
generous 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Program 
donors 
and 
other stakeholders 
so 
that together 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
develop 
an 
appropriate 
road 
transport 
system 
that 
will 
serve 
efficiently 
all 
sectors 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
facilitate 
the 
improvement 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
all 
peoples 
of 
the 
country. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
take 
this 
opportunity 
to 
assure 
you 
and 
all 
development partners 
once 
again 
the 
commitment 
of 
my 
Government 
to 
speed 
up 
the 
needed 
changes 
in 
supporting 
the 
policy 
reform 
process.
