INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA FOR A THIRD
HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$27.5 million to
help finance a Third Highway Project. The loan would have a term of 25
years including a five year grace period with an interest rate of 8 1/2
percent per annum. The African Development Bank (ADB) is contributing
5 million Units of Account (presently equivalent to US$6.0 million) to
the total project cost. The ADB loan would have a term of 22 years
including 4 years of grace with an interest rate of 6 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Liberia in March, 1973.  Its report
"Liberia:  Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No.426a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) has been distributed to the Executive Directors.
Country data sheets are contained in Annex I.
3.        During the 1950s and 1960s Liberia experienced an unprecedented
rate of economic expansion, averaging close to 7 percent. This rapid
expansion has enabled the Government, for the first time in the country's
150-year history, to undertake significant investments in essential economic
and social infrastructure.
4.        The growth has been essentially based on foreign enclaves -- iron
ore mines, rubber plantations and forestry concessions -- with few link-
ages between the concessions and the rest of the economy. As a result,
the benefits of growth have been unevenly distributed. Annual repatriation
by foreigners of profits and savings equals about 20 percent of gross
domestic product; about 4 percent of the Liberians have per capita income
levels above US$3,000, while the vast majority are near subsistence level with
incomes below US$100. To help redress this imbalance the Government pro-
poses to increase its earnings from the enclaves and use the resources to
diversify the economy with increased participation of Liberians.
5.        To help achieve these objectives, the Government is preparing a
national development plan for the period 1976-1979. In this exercise, it
is assisted by a planning team  financed jointly by the Bank, the UNDP, the
USAID and the Government (President's Memorandum R74-61 of March 25, 197h).
Further improvement of public administration, the availability of foreign
capital and technical assistance will, in large part, determine the size of
the public development program.   The Government has initiated a major
effort to improve its administration and increase its capacity to



plan and implement investment programs. The United States, the Federal
Republic of Germany, and the Bank Group have been, and are expected to
remain, the principal sources of external capital. UNDP and USAID are
expected to be the main donors of technical assistance grants.
Recent Trends (1290-129h)
6.        With the transition from the 28-year rule of President Tubman
to the new administration of President Tolbert in 1971, the Government
initiated a number of necessary fiscal reforms, including tighter expend-
iture control and renegotiation of concession agreements. This action
has resulted in a significant improvement of Government's fiscal performance.
Nonetheless, the economy, particularly the non-enclave sectors, has been
under severe strain since 1970. Initially this was caused by uncertainty
in the private sector following the change in administration, and was
accentuated by the fact that rubber -- which, in addition to being an
enclave industry, is also the principal export crop of Liberian farmers --
experienced a price deterioration during 1970-1971 and again in 1974.
7.        The economic setback in the non-enclave economy has persisted
until the first months of 1975 because of the continued contraction, in
real terms, of the public sector and a significant, almost completely
imported, inflation. Three key items illustrate this inflation. First,
rice:  the domestic retail price for a 100 lb bag in March 1973 was about
US$10; at thle end of 1974 it was US$25. Rice is the staple food of
Liberians and dominates the cost of living index. Second, the impact on
internal transportation of higher petroleum prices; this has produced
an increase of about 40 percent in the price for transporting goods and
people. In addition, the cost of power has also gone up. Third, the
price of impor;ed machinery and equipment has increased substantially in
the past two years.   This, in turn, has seriously affected overall invest-
ment costs, particularly in agriculture and road building.
8.        On the export side, each of the three major exports -- rubber,
timber and iron ore -- has been affected differently in the past two years.
Rubber prices rose during 1973 and peaked in early 1974h, dropping sharply
thereafter as the recession in industrial countries set in. In the timber
industry, demand has continued unabated for choice primary species but has
fallen off significantly for secondary ones. In the iron ore sector, the
general shortage of raw materials experienced in 1974 and the relative
accessibility of Liberian ores have enabled the concessions to negotiate
compensation for higher energy costs and a further increase in the contract
prices for 1975 (30 percent higher for ore, 50 percent for pellets). At
the same time, serious interest is being expressed by foreign groups in
the development of three more iron ore deposits in Liberia. In the most
optimistic scenario, all three will be in production by the mid-1980s,
doubling the national output from the present annual 24 million metric
tons to close to 50 million. Concession agreements for two of these new



-3-
iron ore mines are almost completed.   While this would certainly be a
welcome development, it does not lessen the need to pursue a development
strategy of diversification. Opening of new iron ore mines will only
delay the inevitable decline of this sector by a decade or so.
9.        Owing in part to a successful program of fiscal reform
implemented by the Government, the fiscal picture looks reasonably good
for the next five or six years. Manpower constraints are likely to be
the main development bottlenecks in the immediate future.
Balance of Payments and Creditworthiness
10.       Since Liberia uses US dollars as the medium of exchange,
balance of payments analyses are at best tenuous.   In the 1964-1972
period exports grew at 10 percent and imports by 5.9 percent annually.
Thereafter, from 1972-74, following international inflations imports rose by 29
percent annually, exceeding the export growth of 22 percent a year.   Oil
imports increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974.
Nevertheless, Liberia achieved a trade surplus of US$96 million in 1974
which was more than sufficient to offset a deficit on current invisibles.
11.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed was estimated at
US$155 million in December 1974, The debt service ratio was 5.3 percent
in 1974, as compared to 7.1 percent in 1972. The ratio is projected to
fall further in the next few years as final portions of heavy debt incurred
in the earl;y 1960s are paid off' The Government has contracted little new
debt in recent years and most of it at concessionary terms. The proportion
of outstanding debt owed to the Bank/DA is currently about 15 percent.
Even with an expanded public borrowing program and assuming the most adverse
external conditions, Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1 980s is
estimated to remain below 5 percent of exports.   The country should,
therefore, be regarded as creditworthy for the proposed Bank loan.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
12,       The Bank Group has made 10 loans for projects in Liberia totaling
US$32.7 million; 4 IDA credits totaling US$17 million and one technical
assistance grant of TJS$200,000 for development planning (paragraph 5). IFC
has made one equity investment: US$250,000 in the share capital of the
Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI); the Bank loans have
been for roads, port expansion, power and LBDI. The IDA credits have been
for education and agriculture. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as at June 30, 1975, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.



13.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:   (a) to increase
the absorptive capacity of the economy and enable the Liberians to take
greater initiatives in developing their own resources for the benefit of
their own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to a
broader sharing of the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the
Government in broadening the economic base; and (d) to assist the
Government in mobilizing development resources for sound projects from
other external agencies.
14.       The proposed project, for which the African Development Bank
is also providing assistance, represents the culmination of several years
of study of the needs of the transport sector. A second education project
was preappraised in April. Studies have just been completed for an inte-
grated rural development effort in central Liberia along with a possible
rubber project.
PART III- THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
15.       The latest Bank analysis of Liberia's transport sector is con-
tained in Volume VI of the last economic report (No. 426a-LBR dated
March 1, 1975)e
16.       Liberia's transport system includes about 4,200 miles of roads,
300 miles of privately owned railways, four seaports and two major airports
that provide international and inter-African service. The railways are
owned by mining companies and almost exclusively haul iron ore. The sea-
ports handle about 23 million tons of cargo each year, of which about 90
percent is iron ore and pellets. Roads are the dominant mode of domestic trans-
port and accouint for almost the entire movement of persons and non-enclave
products. The movement is mostly from the hinterland to the seaports--
Monrovia particularly -- and from villages to metropolitan areas and
vice-versa. Precise statistics on the volume of this traffic are not
readily available but rough estimates suggest a rising trend of about
5 percent per aLnnum over the past five years.
17.       Most of the road network, which consists mainly of all-weather
(1,900 miles) aid dry-weather farm to market roads (2,600 milei, has been built
over the last 20years with United States technical assistance financial aid from
the Export-Import Bank of United States and some suppliers' credits. More
recently, the Federal Republic of Germany, the African Development Bank
and the World Bakc Group have contributed to development of the transport
sector. Much remains to be done, however, because Liberia's transport
facilities are inadequate for the country's size and economic potential.
For example, other West African countries -- Sierra Leone, Cameroon and
Ivory Coast -- respectively have 33, 38 and 71 km of roads per 1,000
population as against 4.2 km in Liberia. About half of all road traffic
is concentrated in Monrovia alone and more than three-fourths is concentrated
in the Monrovia-Ganta corridor, which is the main population-commercial-
agricultural axis of the country (see map).



18.       The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is responsible for the
public highway network. Its functions are performed through four bureaus --
one each for administrative services, technical services, operations and
construction. The ministry also has a planning division which reports
directly to the Deputy Minister. As part of the Second Highway Project
(Credit 395-LBR; Loan 907-LER both of May 24h, 1973), technical assistance
is being provided to help reorganize the ministry, with particular emphasis
on improving its capacity to maintain roads and equipment adequately.
Implementation of the maintenance program under the project is progressing
slowly. In addition to the initial organizational delay, there was a cost
overrun on the US-financed maintenance equipment, and a delay in its delivery.
USAID has since agreed to provide supplementary financing. Contracts for
the Monrovia Bypass and all engineering studies have been signed, and work
is now progressing satisfactorily.
19.       A central objective of the government's development policy is
to promote more balanced growth, particularly through increased emphasis
on agricultural development in rural areas. Improved transport is a vital
part of this effort and the Government is moving to open up inaccessible
areas and to strengthen and upgrade existing primary and secondary roads.
An overall blueprint for these activities, including a five year Highway
Maintenance and Development Program (1973-1977) was prepared in 1972.
This program was the subject of an aid coordination meeting of bilateral
and multilateral donors in October, 1972. The proposed project is an
integral part of the overall sector development program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       The proposed project originated from studies financed under the
Second Highway Project (Loan 907-LBR; Credit 395-LBR of May 24, 1973).
The project was appraised by a Bank mission in November/December 1974.
A report entitled "Liberia: Appraisal of a Third Highway Project",
No. 805-LBR dated August 5, 1975, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is presented in Annex III.
Negotiations took place in Washington on July 23 and 24. The Borrower was
represented by a team headed by Mr. Winston Richards, Deputy Minister of
Public Wtorks.
Project Content
21.       The project has three main objectives: First, to help improve
accessibility between central rural/agricultural regions and the country's
major commercial link with the outside world -- Monrovia; second, to
strengthen the planning function in the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
and to prepare for future projects; third, to help lay the foundation for
more rational transport and urban development of Monrovia itself.
22.       The project includes the following components:
(a)   Construction of a two-lane bridge (1,400 feet) across the
Mesurado River in Monrovia;



(b)   Upgrading of 'United Natic,,ns Drive (3_4 miles) leading
to the port of Monrovia;
(c)   Construction and realignment of the lotota-Ganta road
(83 miles);
(d)   A three-year program for construction and. improvement
of about 150 miiles of feeder roads;
(e)   Technical assistance to MPW's Planning Division;
(f)   Consulting services for:   (i) construction supervision of
items (a), (b) and (c) above; (ii) f'easibility studies
for improvemelnt of the roads Ganta-Tapeta (65 miles) and
Ganta-Sanniquellie (25 miles); (iii) detailed engineering
for the Mount Coffee Dam road (15 mi:Les); and (iv) a study
of Monrovia's urban development and transport system.
23.       The bridge and the United Nations Drive are vital links to
Monrovia's port area and to the commercial core of the capital city. They
are logical followups to the Second Highway Project, which is promoting im-
proved port accessibility through construction of the Monrovia bypass (see
map). These port/commercial center access roads, in turn, are in a sense
terminal networks for the backbone of the Liberian highway grid--the 83-
mile Totota-Ganta road, which serves the most populous and agriculturally
important up-country corridor, northeast from Monrovia to the borcer with
Guinea,and provides access to Sierra Leone and Southwestern Liberia as well.
All of the feeder road work would be in Lofa county and would service the
area being assisted by the Lofa County Agricultural Development Project, for
which a $6.0 million Credit was approved on July 22, 1975.   The technical
assistance for olanning in the Ministry oi Public Works basically serves
an i:nstitution building function.  It would help make the new planning
division fully operational by including financing for the services of two
technical assistance experts over two years to fill the posts of civil
engineer and transport economist and to train local staff. The special
studies are designed to: (a) assist the Government in developing roads in
the interior; (b) investigate various alternatives for the future rational
development of Monrovia and to provide a structural plan for alleviating
the city's transport and housing problems.
Project Cost and Financing
24.       The total cost of the project (including contingencies) is
estimated at US$46.L4 million (excluding about US$0.` million in taxes), of
which about US$J3.5 million are foreign costs and about US$12.9 million
equivalent are local costs. Fquipment and materials imported for the project
are free from duties and taxe!s.  The foreign cost of the project will be
financed by the Bank ($27.5 million) anc the African Development Bank ($6
million).  The Government will provide all the local costs (about US$12.9
million equivalent). The details of project cost estimates are presented
in Annex III and summarized below:

Project Execution
25.       The Ministry of Public Works will be responsible for project
execution. Consultants will be required for construction supervision,
feasibility studies, detailed engineering and for the urban planning
study. During negotiations, Government confirmed that consultants, as
well as technical assistance experts to be attached to the Ministry's
Planning Division, would be selected in agreement with, and under terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank (Section 3.02, Loan Agreement).
26.       Construction contracts for the bridge, UN Drive and Totota-
Ganta road will be bid as separate packages. Supervision of construction
of the entire Totota-Ganta road (including the ADB-financed section) will
be by the same consultants. The proposed feeder road work will be carried



- 8 -
out by the MPW through a new feeder road unit to be created within the
Ministry. In order to assure the prompt availability of funds for daily
operations and procurement of materials and spare parts, Government agreed
to establish a special revolving fund for the feeder road unit (Section 3.07,
Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursements
27.       Construction contracts for all major works will be awarded
following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Procurement of equipment and materials will also be on the
basis of international competitive bidding. Equipment suppliers would
be required to provide adequate after-sales services locally. Spare
parts may be procured on the basis of locally advertised competitive
bidding; major suppliers are represented in Liberia and competition
between them is adequate. Equipment, which in the interest of standard-
ization it is appropriate to obtain from a specific manufacturer, may
be obtained by negotiations with suppliers of such equipment. The
aggregate cost of spare parts and standardized equipment which can be
procured without international competitive bidding would however not
exceed $300,000.
28.       Loan proceeds will be disbursed over four years (details in
Annex III)on the following basis: (a) 85 percent of total expenditures
for Mesurado River Bridge construction contracts; (b) 64 percent of
total expenditures for UN Drive construction contracts; (c) 69 percent
of total expenditures for Totota-Ganta road construction contracts;
(d) 86 percent of total experkditures for consulting services and technical
assistance, representing the estimated foreign costs; (e) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures for equipment, spare parts and materials; (f) 2h
percent of total operating cost of feeder road unit.
Benefits
29.       The proposed project will improve the transport infrastructure
of Liberia, presently a major cons'traint to the development of the country
outside the foreign enclaves., Construction of the Totota-Ganta road and
Lofa County feeder roads wil-L provide or improve key section of the rural
transport system and, in the process, open up the agricultural heartland
of the country where the average income of beneficiaries is about US$70 per



- 9 -
annum, and about one-fourth of the national average. Construction of the
Mesurado River Bridge and improvement of UN Drive will improve access to
the port of Monrovia, making a significant contribution to efficient
commerce. The proposed technical assistance to the MPW will help consolidate
the institution building effort in sectoral management and highway planning
started under the Second Highway Project. The urban study of Monrovia will
help establish the framework for an efficient transport and land use program
for the capital city.
30.       On the basis of the quantifiable benefits -- namely reduced main-
tenance costs of roads, reduced vehicle operating costs, time saving of
users, improved clearance of the port area -- the proposed investments are
expected to yield an overall economic return of 23 percent. Individual
returns for the three major project items are: Bridge, about 16 percent;
improvement of UN Drive, about 36 percent; construction of Totota-Ganta road,
about 38 percent. Labor has been shadow-priced at 50 percent of the wage
rate for evaluation of the Totota-Ganta road because of limited opportunities
in the interior and at full market rates for other project components.
PART V - IEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.       The draft Loan Agreement between Liberia and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the texts of the resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
32.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 25, 26 and 27 of this Report.
33.       An additional condition of effectiveness would be that the ADB
Loan Agreement is duly executed (Section 6.01, Loan Agreement).
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
34.       I an satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 617-IER                         Port Development Project; US$3.6 million
Loan of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
May 31, 1975.
This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area within
the Monrovia port to accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers; provision of
two tugs and a pilot launch, as well as additional buoying and lighting of the
navigable channels; consultants' services for individual advisers and feasibility
studies for the development of road approaches to the port. Project execution
has been satisfactory. The Bank has agreed to the Government's request that
funds still undisbursed be used to help finance an overall study of port develop-
ment needs in Liberia, which was stipulated in the project. Government signed
a contract in May 1974 for the port development study.
Loan No. 684-LEBR                        Power projects; US$7.7 million Loan of
June 4, 1970 (fully disbursed) and US$7.6
Loan No. 778-LER                        million Loan of October 26, 1973; Closing
date: June 30, 1975.
The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) have helped finance
the expansion of the Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, the installation of two
gas turbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; procurement and erection of 42
miles of overhead lines in Monrovia and 54 miles in outlying areas; establish-
ment of a new substation and related facilities. There have been cost overruns
mainly due to international currency fluctuations and the purchase of larger
generators than originally anticipated. A supplemental loan of US$2.9 million
was provided in October, 1973 to cover the cost overruns, and project imple-
mentation is proceeding satisfactorily. On July 8, 1975, the Board approved
a technical assistance loan of' $1.8 million for PITA.

Credit No. 306-LBR                Agriculture project; US$1.2 million
Credit_of Ma 17* 19 2: Closing date.,
December 31, 1976.
The agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and
preparation of detailed investment proposals for integrated rural
development projects; a physical survey and detailed study of the
Liberian-owned rubber industry; a pilot rubber scheme to provide
Liberian rubber farmers with credits to rehabilitate untapped or
poorly tapped rubber; improving rice research; reorganization of
the Ministry of Agriculture and training for Liberians to prepare
investment projects. Effectiveness of this credit had to be post-
poned because of difficulties in obtaining necessary staff for the
project unit. A project administrator was designated in January,
1973 but left after a month because of irreconcilable differences
with the Ministry of Agriculture. A replacement served for a year
and a half but recently was forced to resign because of illness.
The Government has decided to carry on the project using staff from
the ministry. Consultants will be retained to carry out the reor-
ganization study of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Loan No. 839-LBR                  Development FiaUance Copan; US$1
million Loan of June 26 1972:
Closing date:
Loan No. 1055-LBR                 December 31. 1976 and US$4 million
Loan of December 1. 174: Closing
date June 30. 1279.
The first loan contributed to foreign exchange costs of
industrial projects financed by LBDI in 1972 and 1973. This loan is
fully committed.    The second loan would help LBDI meet its finan-
cial requirements through calendar year 1976.
Credit No. 907-LBR                Highway Project; US$3.0 million Loan
of June 13, 1973: Closing date:
December 31, 12779;
Loan No. 395-LBR                  and US$2.6 million Credit of June 13,
1973; Closing date: December 31. 1977.
Implementation of the maintenance program, which started
about six months behind schedule, is progressing slowly. Further
delays were caused by a US$4.0 million cost overrun on the US-financed
maintenance equipment, andt a delay in its delivery. USAID has agreed
to provide supplementary financing. Contracts for all engineering
studies have been signed, and work progress is satisfactory. The
construction contract for the Monrovia Bypass has been awarded and
work has begun.

Credit No. 305-LBR                Education project; US$7.2 million
Credit of May 17. 1972: Closing
date; March 1. 1978
The education credit is helping to finance construction of,
and provide equipment for, two new multilateral high schools in the
north and the east, each offering a wide curriculum in agriculture,
mechanics and academic subjects; construction of and equipment for a
new college of agriculture and forestry; expansion of a rural teacher
training institute and construction of an adjacent demonstration
school, technical assistance and fellowships for manpower and education
planning, technical teacher training, secondary education and project
implementation. Some delay was encountered initially in obtaining
requisite expatriate staff for the project unit and the original
effectiveness date had to be postponed. This problem has been over-
come and project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
