REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1156-LBR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This report presents a completion evaluation of the Third Highway
Project in Liberia for which Loan 1156-LBR for US$27.5 million was approved
on August 28, 1975. Co-financing was provided by the African Development
Bank (US$6.0 million) and the Overseas Development Administration (UK)
funded some technical assistance (US$230,000).
A draft Project Completion Report was prepared by the executing
agency, the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) in November 1981. The draft
was discussed during a subsequent supervision mission after which it was
finalized by MPW and officially submitted to the Bank on July 30, 1982.
No separate mission was undertaken for the preparation of this report.
After review by the West African Region and OPS it was concluded
that, apart from a few minor discrepancies (paragraphs 2 and 6 of Highlights
section), there were no differences of substance between the views of the
Bank and the Government and that the report provided a comprehensive evaluation
of project implementation. Therefore, it was decided to use the Government's
report as the basis for the PCR with the Preface, Basic Data Sheet and Highlights
sections, and updated Cost and Disbursement tables added by WAPTI; Government's
comments on these additions have been taken into account. The Government
report was not edited to allow full presentation of its views, although the
names of consultants and contractors were deleted in accordance with World
Bank policy and in agreement with the Government.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.

REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1156-LBR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.       The project was successfully completed within the cost estimates
although with a 2.5 year delay. The purpose of the Third Highway Project
was to assist the Government in the implementation of its first Five Year
Road Maintenance and Development Program launched at an international
donors conference in Monrovia in 1972. The project originally provided
for the construction of a major artery and bridge in Monrovia, and
reconstruction and surfacing of an important section of the major highway
connecting Monrovia with the interior; establishment of a feeder roads
unit and construction or improvement of feeder roads in support of the
IDA financed Lofa County Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 577-LBR);
feasibility studies for further upgrading of the main highway to the
interior; an urban development study for Monrovia; detailed design for a
secondary road just outside Monrovia; and technical assistance for the
road transport planning unit. During implementation the project was
modified: the intended detailed design study for the proposed road
improvement was dropped for lack of economic justification while another
detailed design for a bridge access road was added, and one technical
assistance position for the planning unit was substituted for three
fellowships.
2.       All components of the revised project were fully implemented
except for the feeder roads; 87 percent of the targeted mileage had been
achieved when implementation of the follow-up Feeder Roads Project
started in early 1980 and took over. Total project expenditure remained
just within the appraisal estimate despite a long delay in project
completion. The PCR reports substantial cost overruns on a number of
project items based on comparing actual costs with initial contract amounts;
comparing actual costs with appraisal estimates shows an underrun of 2 per-
cent for the combined civil works by contract; an underrun of 43 percent
for the feeder road unit; and an overrun of 52 percent for the combined
consultants' services for contract supervision due to protracted execution.
3.       The project suffered a two and a half year delay, primarily
because the three year contract for a major civil works item, the
construction of the Totota-Ganta road, took five and a half years to
complete. The delays were caused by: the initial poor site organization






- vi -
of the contractor; inclement weather; late payment of local share of
invoices due to budgetary constraints following the deterioration of the
country's economic condition; occasional unavailability of construction
materials in the country; and disruptions following the coup d'etat of
April 1980. The Bank financed section of the Totota-Ganta road was
completed in February 1979 but the Bank agreed to meet from the loan
surplus the foreign element of the cost overrun on the AfDB financed
section.
4.       The contractor for the Totota-Ganta road submitted claims for a
total of US$11.8 million for extra works, payment delays, civil
disturbances and non-availability of materials. The Government
negotiated a settlement with the contractor agreeing to US$3.5 million
additional compensation. The claim settlement was reflected in an
amendment to the contract which was signed without seeking Bank
concurrence. Bank staff, after reviewing the claims and the supervising
consultants' claims analysis, considered only US$1.6 million justified
and disbursed on this basis. Due to budgetary constraints the Government
was unable to meet its commitments under this and other civil works
contracts in a timely manner and issued promissory notes instead. The
Bank, considering the exceptional circumstances, raised no objection to
this approach but urged the Government to eliminate the payment arrears
as soon as possible by postponing new highway investments, to which the
Government agreed.
5.       The three fellowship candidates successfully completed their
studies. Two graduates are presently occupying senior positions in the
Ministry. The other took up the position of managing director of the
Monrovia Transit Authority and subsequently went into the private sector.
6.       The PCR re-estimation of the economic rates of return for the
civil works items is overstated: it compares construction
costs in 1975 prices with road user benefits expressed in prices of the
year of opening of the facility. Recalculated rates of return using the
same base year for costs and benefits are satisfactory and compare as
follows with the appraisal estimates:
Economic Rate of Return (%)
Appraisal      Ex-post
Johnson Street Bridge                        16.1          19.2
UN Drive                                     36.0           34.6
Totota-Ganta Road                            38.0           24.1
Weighted Average                             33.7           25.4
The reduced overall rate of return is primarily the result of the lower
return on the Totota-Ganta road caused by the completion delay and lower
than anticipated traffic growth due to the unfavorable economic climate
and travel restrictions following the change in Government. It is






- vii -
recommended that, in the light of the general decline in traffic growth
since 1980, a re-assessment is made of the need for widening of the
Johnson Street Bridge and part of the UN Drive as early as the mid-19800
as originally foreseen.
7.       Apart from the negative observations in paragraphs 3 and 4,
borrower, contractor, supervising consultants and technical assistance
performances were generally satisfactory. In retrospect, dividing the
construction of the 130 km Totota-Ganta road into two separate contracts
might have enabled completion within the original schedule and at lower
cost. Institutional development was impaired by the resignation of a
substantial number of senior MPW staff after the coup of 1980. The
proposed Fifth Highway Project provides for the strengthening of MPW's
new management.

F O R E W O R D
This report is the Final Project Completion Report and
therefore replaces the Draft Project Completion Report (PPB-TR27)
which was prepared in January 1981. As such all efforts have been
made to include as much relevant documented information as possible.
There are two main reasons for preparing this completion report.
The first reason is that it is a requirement of the lending institu-
tions especially the World Bank that provided most of the financial
resources that made the implementation of the Third Highway Project
possible. The second reason is that it provides an opporturnity for
the borrowing agency to review its before and after project decisions
and activities.
Special thanks go to the staff of the Programme Co-ordinator:'s
Office, the Transport Engineering Division, and the Civil Engineering
Division for their assistance and co-operation in providing the neces-
sary information.
On behalfof my colleagues Messrs P.S.K.Woodtor, R.A.Sherman III
and myself, I wish to formally extend our thanks and appreciation to
the World Bank and the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of
Public Works for the opporturnity given us to study under the Third
Highway Project Technical Assistance/Fellowship Programme.

SECTION 1
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Multi-Donor Approach has provided an advantage in the plan-
ning and development of the highway network of Liberia. In July 1975
the Government of Liberia (GOL) and the International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development (IBRD) negotiated Loan Agreement 1156 LBR,
known as the Third Highway Project. The $27.5 million Loan became
effective on August 28, 1975. During the same month of Augus' GOL and
the African Development Bank (ADB) negotiated Loan CS/LB/TR/'5/005 for
the amount of $6.0 million to cover the foreign exchange cost for im-
provement of the Gbarnga-Ganta section of the Totota-Gbarnga-Ganta
Road. The ADB Loan was signed on September 8, 1975. The British Over-
seas Development Mission provided one Master Mechanic for two - one
year tour for implementation of the feeder roads component of the pro-
ject.
The Third Highway Loans provided for the improvement of 83 miles
of primary roads; improvement of 150 miles of feeder roads; technical
assistance; provision of supervision services and pre-investment stu-
dies. The Loans became effective on November 28) 1975. The expected
date of rolm 1tinn wqs cot at roconibor '3, 1978. but later revised to
June 1961.
The Ministry of Public Works was responsible for the successful
implementation of all components of the project. Consulting services
were, however engaged to conduct pre-investment studies, consrruction
ubippr':ision, construction operations and technical assistance activi-
ties.
The Bridge and U.N. Drive projects started in January 1976 and
were scheduled to be completed by October 1977. However, it was not
until January 1979 that both projects were finally completed. As a
result of increases in the prices of construction materials including
labour and oxtennian of Ohe nonstructinn peuiod due to shortage of



- 2 -
aggregates, late possesion of sites and incl mir,t weather conditions
each project experienced a 21 per cent increase in cost. Claims
amounting to over $5 million were presented by both contractors.
However, only a little over $2.1 million was justified by the bidding
committee.
The Totota-Ganta Road experienced the most difficulties with
about 43 per cent cost increase over the original contract cost.
Supervision cost was up by about 81 per cent beyond the estimated cost.
The second and final section of the road was completed in May 1982 more
than three years beyond the original time scheduled.
A total of 130 miles of feeder roads were improved within the area
of influence of the IDA-Financed Lofa County Agricultural Development
Project (LCADP). Only four miles of new construction was carried on,
the remaining 126 miles being re-construction.
The first three Liberian pioneers in the areas of Transportation
Economics/Planning and Transportation Engineering were trained under
the Technical Assistance Program. The consultant provided under the
program also mnde it possible to develop the expertise required to
handle the planning activities of MPW.
The Monrovia Urban Development Study also contributed to the
identification and selection of "Action Projects' which are to be im-
plemented as from mid 1982 under the first phase of the Monrovia Urban
Development Project.
Due to several reasons disbursement of funds did not proceed as
originally scheduled. As of the estimated date for the last disburse-
ment (June 1979) only 64 per cent of the estimated accumulated dis-
bursement was made.
In summary, the overall performance of MPW during the execution of
the Third Highway project can be graded as satisfactory.    There is
some evidence, though that more could have been achieved had MPW in-
voked its experiences acquired from execution of the first two aighway
projects.

Even though all components of the project have been completed,
the Government of Liberia is still exploring means of liquidating its
financial indebtedness to the various contractors and consultants
that provided construction and construction management services respec-
tively.
The economic re-evaluation of the bridge, U.N. Drive and Totota-
Ganta Roads show the following results. For the People's Bridge pro-
ject the calculated economic rate of return is 28 per cent compared with
16.1 per cent estimated in the appraisal report and 26 per cent estimated
by the consultants in 1972. The economic internal rate of return esti-
mated for the U.N. Drive project is 49 per cent compared with 36 per cent
estimated in 1979. For the Totota-Ganta Road, the internal rate of re-
turn is estimated as 32 per cent as compared with 38 per cent estimated
in 1975.
The conclusion is that all components of the Third Highway Project
are economically justified and socially desirable.

BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT
The Third Highway Project forms part of the    r         of L
Five Ye"a- nlond MAintenance and Development Program, usually rcforred to
as GOL/PYRMADP. The GOL/FYRMADP was launched in 1972 at a Kulti-Donor
Conference held in Monrovia.
The First Highway Project (Loan 368-LBR. US$4.25 million) had then,
however started in August 1965 and was completed in June 1969. The pro-
ject comprised the re-construction of two roads and the supplying of
equipment for road miintenance. The Second Highway Project (Loan 907/
Credit 395-LBR. US$5.6 million) began on June 13, 1973 and was completed
in early 1978. The components of the project included:
1) Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Public Works
to assist in the following:
(a) re-organisation of the Ministry
(b) improvement of highway maintenance operations
(c) training of maintenance personnel
(d) conducting a study for promoting Liberia
construction Industry.
2) Technical Assistance to MPW to co-ordinate the various
project activities of the Government's program for high-
way maintenance and development including the Second
Highway Project;
3)  Purchase of highway maintenarxue equipment and spare parts;
4)  Constujction of and equipment for workshop facilities;
5x Detailed Engineering, Construction and Construction
Supervision for upgrading the Monrovia By-Pass (8.4
miles);
6) Detailed Engineering for access roads to the Free
Port of Monrovia including the Mesurado River Bridge
and for Totota-Ganta Road (83 miles);

THE THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
3.1 General Description
The Third Highway project comprised of the following components:
Road Construction and Improvement
a) construction of a two lane bridge (about 1,400
feet) across the Mesurado River;
b) upgrading of the United Nations Drive (5.4 miles);
c) construction and re-alignment of the Totota-Ganta
Road (83 miles); and
d) construction and improvement of about 150 miles of
feeder roads included in the IDA-financed Lofa County
Agricultural Development Project.
Technical Assistance
a
The provision of the services of/Civil Engineer and a
Transport Economist to serve in the Planning and Program-
ming Division of the Ministry of Public Works.
Consultants' Services
The provision of consultants' services for:
i) pre-investment studies for improvement of the
roads Ganta-Tappita (65 miles) and Ganta-San-
niquellie (25 miles);
ii) preparation of detailed engineering for the
Mount Coffee Dam Road (15 miles);
iii) carrying out a study of Monrovia Urban Develop-
ment and Transport System; and
iv) Construction supervision for (a), (b) and (c)
above.
3-1.1 Construction of the Mesurado River Bridge
The first bridge across the Mesurado River was built in 1946 to
serve as a haul road for construction of the rreW Port of Monrovia.
Although the bridge superstructure still exists in good condition due
partly to renovation in 1968, its capacity to handle tne then existing



- 6 -
peak-hour traffic had become inadeauate to the extent that long traffic
queques and hours of delay became verv frequent.
According to the World Bank Mission which apprnisi,d the Thi.a
Hjighway Project, the 1975 traffic volume on the bridge had rmached
nearly 24,000 vehicles per day (vpd) and was expected to reach 34,000
vpd by 1980 assuming a per annum growth rate of 6 per cent. Previous
analyses conducted by consultants (USA) as presented in their 1972
Feasibility Study for improvement of the Monrovia Port Area Approach
Roads and Mesurado River crossing at Vai Town revealed that overall
traffic in the Monrovia area could have increased from its 1972 level
of 60,000 trips per day to 175,000 trips per day by the year 1994, Tnke
consultant study therefore recommended the construction of an additional
bridge to handle future traffic.
The Mesurado River Bridge project consisted of the construction
of a new bridge (about 1,400 feet post-tensioned girder) in addition to
the existing Mesurado River Bridge with a two-lane road plus improvement
of the southern approach to the two bridges. The proposed design stand-
ards of the new bridge are presented in Table 1.
3.1.2 UPGRADING OF THE UNITED NATIONS DRIVE
The engineering study for improvement of the U.N. Drive was conducted by
the same consultantswho prepared the feasibility study under the Second
Hiahway Project.
Trh United Nations (U.N) Drive Project consisted of the fbllow-
ing improvements:
a) a four-lane divided highway on the lower section
(1.5 miles);
b) a two-lane road on the middle section with parking ,,^
on.each  side (2.0 miles); and
c) a two-lane road on the upper section.
The design standards for each section were based on projected
traffic density, commercial activity and operating conditions. The pro-
posed design standirde fbr acwh road section are presented also in
Table 1.

3.1.3    Constructionjad RE-alignment ol' the Totota-Ganta
Road (83 miles)
The Totota-Ganta Road is a major trunk road that links the South-
east and northwest part of Libcria with Monrovia. Detailed engineering
studies for improvement of the road were conducted by consultants
(Denmark) as part of the Second Highway Project.
The project consisted cf construction of a two-lane paved road on
an existing laterite road including re-alignment of p3rticular soctions.
For the Totota-Gbarnga section, a two inch asphalt concrete surface
course on a crushed stone base was recommended by the consultants.
The consultant's recommendation was based on tho estimated traffic den-
sity and in consideration of the absence of riataral base material in
the vicinity of the area. For the Gbarnga-Ganta section, the Consul-
tants recommended a double surface treatment ,n laterite base course.
The proposed design standards are shown in Table 1.
3.1.4    Construction and Improvement of Feeder Roads
The Fecaer Road project involved the implementation of a three
ZOar pL-0gt awl] of construction and improvement of nearly 150 m_les of
feeder roads in the area cf influence of the Lofa County Agricultural
Development Project. The project was to be executed by a feeder road
which was
unit/to be established within the Bureau of Construction of the Mini-
stry of Public Works.
3.1.5    Technical Assistance to MPW PI':,aring Division
The Technical Assistance program provi-id Lf.nancing for the
services of two technical assistance exper-cs over a period of two
years.  The Terms of Reference for the Trans;3rt Economist technical
assistance position are shown in Appendix A.
3.1.6    Pre-Investment Studies, Detailed Engineering and Con-
sultant' Services
Pre-investment studies were to be conducted for improvL-3ent of the
Ganta-Tappita Road (65 miles) and Ganta-Sanniquellie Road (25 miles).



- 8 -
The project also included detailed engineering studies for upgrading
certain sections of the Mt. Coffee Dam Road (15 miles) which were
proved feasible. Also included ws the provision of financing for con-
struction supervision services for the Bridges, U.N. Drive and Totota-
Ganta projects.
3.1.7    Monrovia Urban Plennins Studies
The Monrovia Urban Planning Study was to consist of the lollow-
ing:
a) general urbanization studies which would investigate
urban development policies, and identify and analyze
feasible alternatives ror development; and
b)  preparation of a C.;;ai.ed structural plan for the
urban development aLternative selected as a result of
the- ¢rudies.

SECTION 4
PROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
The total cost of the Third Highway project (including contin-
gencies) was estimated as $46.7 million at the time of the World Bank
Appraisal in 1975. The estimated foreign and local components were
$33.5 million and $13.2 millionr- respectively. Taxes accounted for
nearly $0.3 million. The World Bank's contribution was estimated at
$27.5 million or 59 per cent while the African Davelopment Bank's con-
tribution was also estimated at $6.0 million or 13 per cent. The
local component of $13.2 million (28 per cent) was to be provided by
the Government of Liberia. The detailed break-dw4n of the project
cost at the Lime of appraisal is oresented in Table 2.
Cons,rc 'LLC--I 7osts were es.'>>_ based on consultants' results
from detailed :; ineering studies and mid - 1974 estimates for similar
works. These costs were then updated to 1975 which was the planr.ed
date for bid opening. Consulting services and technical assistance
costs were estimated based on experience from other West African
Countries. To allow for possible .ariation in quantities, a 10 per
cent contingency was provided Ior construction works while price con-
tingencies were estimated to allow for inflation rates in the follow-
ing manner: (a) 16% in 1975, 14% in 1976 and 12% in 1O77-79 for con-
struction items; and (b) 12% in 1975, 10% in '976 and 8% in 1977-79
for the other items.

SECTION 5
EXECUTION AND ANALYSIS OF F'43ECT
The Ministry of Public Works was responsible tor tb'- I.mplementa-
clon of allcomponents of the Third Highway Project. Consulting ser-
vices were, however engaged to conduct pre-investment studies, con-
struction supervision and technical assistance activities.
5.1 Iesurado River Bridge and U.N. Drive
Construction of the new bridge (Tucker/People's bridge) and the
United Nations Drive commenced in January 1976. The bridge project
was originally planned to be completed by October 1977. However, Ithe
project completion date was extended to January 1979 due to some dif-
ficulties.
The contracts for construction management and construction opera-
tion for the bridge were awarded to two consultants from the USA and
France respectively. The construction contract cost was originally
estimated as $6,687,453. The actual cost of the project at the time
of completion was calculated as $8.101 million; an increase of 21 per
cent. The increase in the project cost was due mainly to increase in
the prices of construction items and labour.
Several difficultiems were experienced during the construction
of the bridge.  The major difficulties comprised ?Ar I'Atd  q conq qc.ten of
sites, delay in the supply of aggregates, intersection of the bridge
contract and the United Nations Drive project and inclement weather
conditions. The contractor's lack of experience in tropical construc-
Lion and the importation of a large quantity of previously used equip-
ment also,resulted to the project delay.
The contractor submitted several claims in the total amount of
$4.029 million. However, after an analysis by the bidding comeittee, ft" qmnvj    welq
reduced to $1.4 million. At present GOL still has an outatending payment
to be maAe t- the -tractor.



- 11 -
5.2 United Nations Drive Improiement
The United lNations Drive improvement contract was awarded to a con-
tractor of Switzerland for a contract amount of $6,586,023. The final
construction cost, however increased to $7.979 million; an increase of
21 per cent.
The project started in January 1976 and was scheduled to be com-
pleted by October 1977. However, the completion time was extended to
January 1979.
Similar to the bridge project, several difficulties were exprerienced
on the U.N. Drive project. The shortage of asphalt, i;iclerment weather
conditions, delay in the approval of the contractor's proposal contri-
buted to delay in the project completion time.
The increase in the cost of the project wes due mainly to price
increase of construction items, labour and claims paid to the contractor.
5,3 Totota-Ganta Road
The Totota-Ganta Road project consisted of the the construction of
40 miles of asphalt paved road and 43 miles of surface dressing on the
existing laterite road.
The contract for construction operation was awarded to an Italian
contractor while the construction supervision contract went to Danish
consultants.
Construction works on the Totota-Gbarnga section commenced in
December 1975. This section was completed in March 1979. The Gbarnga-
Gnnta section was, however completed in l4ay 1982; more than three years
beyond the estimated completion time.
The contract cost of the project was estimated as $16,290,340.00
about $7,077,311 less than the actual construction cost of $23.4 million
or 43 per cent above the contract cost. The increase irn the construc-
tion cost was due to variation in prices of materials, additional works,
redAqign of aligrnent and claims for delayed payments to contrr.ctors.



- 12 -
The construction management contract price of originrtlly $1,336,881
was also increased to $2,474,874.92 due To delay in completing construc-
tion. At present GOL is still exploring means of liquidating its finan-
cial indebtedness to the contractor and consultant.
The following two standards of ivement construction were adopted for
this project.
(a) Totota-C-barnga (40 miles)
Sub-base      6" laterite
Base          6" crushed stone
Surfacirng    2" asphaltic concrete
(b)  Gbc'nga-Garita (43 miles)
Sub-base      6" laterite
Base          6" laterite
Surfacing     2" coat surface dressing
A site inspection of the road was carried out jointly on March 24,
1982 to examine its present condition and thereby determine what reme-
dial measures were necessary for the successful completion of the pro-
ject.
Four areas were identified which require remedial work to be
carried out. The following are recommendations made by the consultants
with regard to the quantity of work required to complete the project.
(a) Chainage 124250-124650
The consultants recommend an improvement of the drain,Te of this
arca by construction of french drains in the side ditches on Loth sides
of the road throughout the length of the cutting from Ch 12'4000 to
124750. In the event of a continuing deterioration of this suction the
consultants also recommend that the road be excavated and replaced with
the following pavement construct3on:
6" crushed stone drainage layer,
6"f laterite sub-base,
6" crushed stone base,
2" asphalt wearing course
(b)   (Chainage 214350-214500
The consultants recommend that the normal side drain section should
be reconstructed to drain to the existing culvert and that a french drain
should be constructed in this side ditch from Ch 2131000 to 214950.



- 13 -
(c) Chainage 323150-323350
The consultants recommend that further erosion should be pre-
vernted by filling the area up to iX original cross-section by placing
as quarried rock into the eroded ditch. The ero. ion to the side of the
shoulder can be repaired by compacting fill material into the damaged
area.
(d) St. John's River Bridge
The consultants recommend that the two wing walls of the scnth-
hern abutment and the eastern wing wall of the northern abutment be
extended by the construction of gabion walls. The western wing wall
of the northern abutment could be given some udditior3al proettct1.on by
placing as quarried rock to the toe of the embankment.
5.4  Construction ,Imrovementof Feder Roads
The construction and improvement of feeder roads under the Third
Highway project beg.an in January 1977. The selection of roads was based
mainly on economic criteria. Design standards were selected on the
basis of tqrain condition, annual volume of goods transported and
expected traffic volume. The design standards adopted for the various
classes of roads are shown in Table 3.
The project was executed by a special unit established within MPW
construction Bureau. rhe British Overseas Development Mission provided
the Master Mechanic for two - one year tour. The proposed personnel
and equipment per brigade are listed in Table 4.
Funds for the project were made available by !BRD on a re-imbursement
basis, except in the case of construction equipment where direct payment
was made to the supplier. Instead of a revolving f'und, letters of credit
were made to appropriate vendore for the purchase of spare parts.
Although the project was planned for the corstruction of 150 miles of
roads during the three year period, about 110 mileo of roads had been com-
pleted by the end of 1979 and 130 miles by January 1980. A list of roads
re-constrllctnd as of January 1980 is given in Table 5.  The total amount



- 14 -
spent for construction of the 130 milos of road was calculated as
$1,367,17.55. A break-down of the project cost and inventory of the
equipment fleet as of January 1980 are also shown in tables fi and 7.
5.5 Technical Assistance to the Planning and Programming
Division and Fellowships
The services of a Transport Economist were engaged in October 1976
for an eighteen month period and were later renewed for two consecutive
periods between April 1978 and October 1980.
A Final Report on Transport Planning Services
provided to the Ministry of Public Works, Report No. WR03, dated
October 1980 was presented to MPW by the Consultant. The various activities
included in the Terms of Reference were execatea appropriately and are re-
viewed below.
The Consultant's overall effort toward the establishment of a priority
investment program in the road transport sector with pirticular reference
to the development of the feedar road network was more than satisfact--ry.
In 1975, the Consultant carried out a study on the "Determination of prio-
rities for Reconditioning Primary Roads". The 1977 study on the develop-
ment of a national feeder road network was conducted under the TOam Leader-
ship of the Consultant. The economic evaluation of the re-gravelling and
re-railverting programme and the Five County Feeder Road Study also provided
an advantage in investment decision making.
Several feasibility studies were completed and made available by the
consultant. These included the Water Street and Mesurado Bridge Improve-
ment Study (1978/79) and the Economic Evaluation of the Development and
Improvement of Secondary Roads in Lower Lofa County (1979). Reports on
the Economic Re-evaluation of the Brewerville-Bopolu Road Improvement
(1976) anA Economic Feasibiljty Study on the Tartuke-Karloke Road project
were also prepared.



- 15 -
ri' Cor.sultants ccwtribution to the developk..  of 4  aiwmr,a,4
approach to the. estimation of vehicle operating costs (VOC) was A major
achievemont In road transport planning in Liberia. In addition, the
studies on the level of road user charges in Liberia made very meaningful
recommendation with regard to the generation of additional revenues for
a Special Road Vund. The study made the following recommendation:
a) Basing the revenue from petroleum products on the
value and not the production in order to ad53ast the
revenue in line with inflation.
b) In addition to (a), an adjustment of the duty fr,e
previledge on vehicles that use public roads.
c)  Ro4i&t-irg the conowuption of petroleum products by
instituting measures lrmuiing limited rationing,
the greater use of public trawmportation, and the
imposition of higher taxes on vehicles exceeding
2,000 ccs. in engine capacity.
A substantial amount of statistics were accumulated by the consul-
tant. All of these exist in files and reports. However, no statistical
bullentins were reproduced.
A Long-Term Work Programme for the Planning and Programming Divi-
sion (now a Bureau) was produced by the consultant in 1979. The report
revie that the undertaking of the various activities contained in the
work Programeo ahould lead to the 4evelopment of an overall transporta-
tion plan for Liberia. The progrtwiunie calls for the establishement of
two Divisions to handle the activities within the Bureau.
The Consultant also prepared several valuable instructional manuals
for carrying out various activities within the area of transportation
planning. Outstanding among these were.
a)  Instructions for using the coulpiter progrinime for
estimating VOC based on the Jan de Weille approach
b) Guidelines for Feedor Road Studies



- 16 -
c) Planning and execution of O-D surveys
d) Guidelines for application of a modified TRRL
approach to estimating VOC.
The Consultant revealed that due to the lack of funds and other
logistics, traffic studies were conducted on an Ad-Hce basis.
The efforts of the consultant in training Liberians in the area of
transportation planning and other related areas were very satisfactory.
The internal training provided to the first two Liberians prior to their
doparture for graduate studies proved more than helpful. It must also be
mentioned that some of a traffic enumerators trained by the consultant in
1976 have now assumed supervisory positions in conducting all relevant
phases of traffic studies.
A list of technical reports prepared by anid with the consultant is
shown in Annex B.
Under the fellowship program, two Liberian Economists left in Septem-
ber 1976, to pursue a Master's Degree Programme in Transport Econo-
mics in the United States of America. The first of the two returned
to Liberia in April 1979 while the second returned in November 1979.
Both of them successfully completed the graduate program in Transporta-
tion at North Western University's Transportation Centar. Several con-
ditions made it difficult for the consultant to work erxtensively with
the Liberian Transport Economists:
a) It took each of the Liberian Transport Economists
at least three months to begin to settle down. The
main reason was that each had to go all around to
secure a loan of about $4,000.00 to cover the ship-
ping and clearing of their personal effects from the
U.S.A. In spite of a recommendation that the alloca-
tion of $2,500.00 per student be given each of them,
a Government regulation applicabler to the sixties was
invoked to over-rule the provisions in the budget
estimate for external training.



- 17 -
b)  The irregularity in the budgetary provisions and
disbursements of funds for field work made it diffi-
cult to undertake field activities and other research
projects.
c) The Liberian Transport Economist who returned in
November 1979 loft the Bureau in May 1980 on an inde-
finite secondment to the Monrovia Transit Authority.
d) The remaining Liberian Transport Economist had to as-
sume heavy administrative duties as Acting Assistant
Minister in the Bureau for almost 7 months considerably
limiting his availability for technical activities.
The activities in which the Liberian Transport Economist received
some training include:
i) Serving as counterpart to the Consult ints' Transport
Economist in the Gbarnga-Kolahun-Mendikoma Feasibility
Study.
ii)  Field socioeconomic data collectioni for the Tappita
Zwedru Road Pre-feasibility Study, including a sur-
vey of logging companies on forest product traffic.
The analysis for this study also included an inter-
pretation of the traffic survey results.
iii)  Participation in the economic Evaluation of the Deve-
lopment and Improvment of Secondary Roads in Lofa
County.
iv) The complete responsibility for the preparation of
the completion report for the IBRD Third Highway
Project which include the economic re-evaluation of
the Mesurado Bridge, U. N. Drive, and Totota-Ganta
Road improvements.
v) Field socio-economic data collection and data analy-
sis for the on-going Five County Feeder Road Study.
5.6 Monrovia Urban Development Study
The Final Report of the Monrovia Urbman Development Study was pre-
pared and presented to GOL by consultants (UK)
in late 1978. During the course of the study the consultants produced
the following intermediate reports: (a) Inception Report (b) Inertri
Report and (c) Draft Final Rcport. The Inception Report outline the



- 18 -
app"oach to the otudy and identified the set of goals and obJectives
required for the future development of Monro';ia; i-#.e tFo interim
report set out the detailed analysis and recommendations pertaining
to development policies, city management, and action projects. A
series of detailed working papers were produced which dealt with in-
dividual study topics.
The Draft and Final Reports outlined the recommcndations formu-
lated in the areas of Development Policies, City Management and
Identification of Action projects; and details of the rccommehde.d deve-
lopment prc!rrammes and the stratugy for their implumcrttation.
A steering committee comprising of various Government Ministries/
Agencies headed by the Ministry of Public Works was set up to review
the Final Report. The committee finally endorsed the Final Report and
also urged the Government to adopt appropriate measures to ensure im-
plementation of recommendations contained in the Report. The first
phase of the Monrovia Urban Development project has started in 1982.
5.7  Gant-TLp2ita-Sanniquellie Fe      i lty Study
The Final Report of the Feasibility Study for the Ganta-Tappita
and Ganta-Sanniquellie Roads was prepared and presented by Italian
consultants in October 1979. Based on comments from the World Bank, African
Development Bank and GOL on the study, an update of the study was pro-
pared and presented by the consultants in November 1979.
The results of the updated economic feasibility indicated the fol-
lowing rates of return by road section:
Ganta-Sanniquellie   -   19.1%
Ganta-Saclcpea       -   20.7%
Saclepea-Tappita     -   17.6%
Detailed engineering studies on the road have been completed under
the Fourth Highway project.

SECTION 6
Cletion-Time, Costs. Disbursements and Performance of Borrower
and Consultants
Completion time for each construction componen. of th, project wan
extended beyond the appraisal estimated time. Construction and uu.OvL_
sion contracts and conetruction works commenced as scheduled. Due to
circumstances enumerated previously completion times had to be extended.
Detailed engineering study on the Mount Coftee Dam Road was not conducted
since the economic evaluation could not justify the project for oxternaL
financing except for the first five miles.
The costs for executing each construction component of the project
were beyond the appraisal estimates by as much as 43 and 81 per eent re-
spectively for construction and supervision of the Totota-Ganta Road.
Due to a number of reasons disbursoments did not proceed as sche-
duled. Minor cases included the delay in presenting invoices to the
lending institutions. The estimated and actual disbursement schedule is
given in Table 8. Up to the end of the estimated completion time for the
project only 64 per cent of the estimated accumulative disbursement was
made. According to the schedutlc a balanoe of S.31S million is to be
disbursed at later dates.
The overall performance of MPW in the execution of the Third Highway
Project can be regarded as satisfactory. There is some evidence,
though that more could have been achieved bad MPW evoked its experlenQes
acquired from execution of the first two highway projects.
Several consulting firms were involved in the execution of the
Tlnird Highway project. US consultants provided the construction
supervision services for construction of the new bridge and improvement
of the United Nations Drive. Construction supervision services were
provided by Danish consultants for the Totota-Ganta Road. The Urban
Development Study for Monrovia was prepared by consultants from the UK;
while Transport Planning services were provided by a Gnanaian.
The individual consulting teams provided the required services

to the best of their ability. It must bc pointed out, however that much
could have been achieved had an effective monitoring system been adopted
by MPW.

ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION OF
BRIDGE AND THE UFNITED MATIONS DRIVE
7.1 Previous Studies
The major sources of the present re-evaluation are the 1972 Feasibi-
lity Study Report by consultants (USA),the 1975 Appraisal Report by the
World Bank Mission and studies conducted by PPB.
The feasibility study for construction of the new bridgu (Peoples'
Bridge) and improvement of the United Nations Drive was conduct.d by
Stanley Consultants irn 1971. The final report was prcsented to GOL in
June 1972.
Several traffic studies wrxr! conducted by the Consultants in order
to carry out the feasibility study. These included:
a) origin-destination surveys
b) vehicle classification studies
c) turning movement surveys
d) speed and delay studies
u) traffic volume counts, etc.
A swnmary of the results of the feasibility study is presented
below.

During the appraisal of the Third Highway Project in August 1975, an
update of the expected benofits and economic rates of return from construc-
tion of the bridge and improvement of the United Nations Drive was prepared
by the World Bank Mission.
A summary of the updated results is shown below:
Economic Rate of Return
(Percent)
Mesurado River Bridge (new bridge)                  16.1
Upper United Nations Drive                          24.0
Middle United Nations Drive                         50.0
Lower United Nations Drive                          19.5
Entire United Nations Drive                         36.0
7.2 Economic Re-Evaluation of Peoples' Briqc
Improvement with respect to the flow of traffic over the Mesurado
River crossing was purposed in two stagos. The first phase included the
construction of a lighted l,400ft bridge with 30ft. road-way. The second
stage improvement will provide for widening the bridge to accommodate two
additional traffic lanes by 1986.
The Planning and Programming Bureau carried out traffic studies in
1979 before and after the opening of the Peoples' Bridge. The 1979 esti-
mates of average daily traffic, composition and percent composition of
traffic for the pre-and post peoples' Bridge cases are presented in Table
9. The results of a second traffic study conducted on the Peoples' Bri-
dge in Janmary 1980 are given in Table 10.   The estimated traffic growth
rate on the Peoples' Bridge can be expected to redice to 8.6 per cent per



- 30 -
annum up to 1985 and drop to 5 per cent per annum thereafter over the life
of the bridge. The two growth rates ar'i used to project the 1979 bridge
traffic. The results is presented in Table 11.
7.2.1 Actual Construction and Supervision Costs
The combined cost including construction and supervision for the bri-
dge project is presented in Table 12. The present accounting procedure
adopted to effect the disbursemniunt of funds for the project makes it extre-
mely difficult to make a distinction between aupervision mnd construction
costs. The cost for supervision his been evenly distributed over the con-
struction period.  All disbursements made in 1980 have been included in
the 1979 cost since the bridge project was comnplered in 1979. The yearly
cost has been adjusted by assuming an eleven p.- cent rate of inflation.
7.2.2 Estimation of Benefit Components
The benefits from construction of the bridge include tlhe following:
a)   Savings due to distance reduction
b)   Savirgs due to reduction in idling time
c)   Savings due reduction in acceleration
and deceleration
d)   Working drivers' Time Srvings; and
e)   Cost savings to non-bridge traffic.
The procedures adopted in estimating each component of the above
benefits are explained below.
The 1975 savings due to distanco reducti er, 'rstimated by consultants
have been updated by calculating the 1979 vthicle running cost per mile
on paved roads. The updated running cost and resultant running cost per
vehicle-mile are based on the vehicle operating costs given in Table 13
and are presented in Table 14. Assuming a 1975 annual vehicle-miles
saved of 1,541,000 and a cost factor of 20.29 cent per unit the 1979
savings due tc distance reduction have been estimated as $312,700. A
proiection of the savings due to distance reduction is present,.,d in Table
15 assuming a 5.6 per cent per annum growth rate.



- 31 -
An Update of idling costs (vehicles per minute) and stopping costs
(per stop) based on January 1979 prices in presentod in Table 16. The
avorage idlLng and stopping casts are also preeented in Table 16. The
results in Table 16 are summarized below:
Stopping Costs:             1.45e per stop
Idling Costs  :            0.53s  per& u4Aute
Based on the appraisal report estimates of.a saving of;35,123,900
vehicle minutes and 31,800,000 vehicle stops in 1979 and the 14ia-d
average idling and stopping costs presented above the calculated 1979
cost savings due to elimination of idling time is $186,000. The cost
savings due to reduction in acceleration and decleration iB estimated an
$461,000. The cost savings due to the elimination of idling time have
been projected at a rate of 11 per unit per annum; while cost savings
due to reduction in stops are projected at a growth rate of 4 per cent
annum. The projected savings are shown in Table 15.
The surveys required for a realistic estimation of time savings
could not be executed due to the absence of logistics. As such time
savings have been updated by assuming a fifty per cent increase in the
1975 estimate of the weighted average time values of 1.50 cents per
minute (0-5 minutes delay) and 1.57 cents per munute (S-10 minutes
delay); and the estimated 1975 vehicle minutes savings at 6,611,000
(0-5 munutes) and 15,687,000 (5-10 minutes). The estimated 1979 time
saving benefit is $518,000.   A projection of the time savings benefit is
presented in Tablo IS assuming a growth rato of 11.5 per unit per
a 'lMwn.
The basis for the estimation of benefit to non-bridge traffic is
provided in Table 16. Based on the 1975 estimated values for annual
vehicle units saved the estimated 1979 benefit to non-bridge traffic
is $117,000. A growth rate of 5.6 per unit has been applied to the
non-bridge benrfit on a per anum bo.is. Tve resutL. is found in Table
15.



- 32 -
The streams of costs and benefit for the bridge project are
presented in Table 17. The calculated economic rate of return is 28.8
per cent compared with 16.1 per cent estimated in the appraisal report
and 26 per cent estimated by consultants in 1972. The project
life is estimated tn be 30 years.
7.3   Economic Re-Evaluation of the U.N.Drive Improvement
The U.N.Drive road project was considered as three sections
a)  Lower United Nations Drive (1.5 miles) starts at Vai
Town Intersection and ends just north of the Freeport.
b)  Middle U.N. Drive (2.0 miles) starts at the north lower
limit of Lower U.N. Drive and stops at the intersection
with the Mount Coffee Dam Road.
c)  Upper U.N. Drive (1.9 miles) - starts at the north
limit of middle U.N. Drive and ends at the St. Paul
River.
The total length of the project road is 5.4 miles (8.69 km.)
Improvement of the United Nations Drive was proposed in two stages
for each section. For Lower U.N. Drive stage one improvement included
the construction of a divided 6-lane pavement with curb and gutter and
appurtenances. The second stage is expected to start in 1985. It will
provide for the expansion and resurfacing of stage one facilities. For
middle U.N. Drive the first stage improvement included the construction
of a two-lane pavement, shoulders and drainage appurtenances. The
second stage improvement which is to start in 1984 will allow for
widening stage one pavement to four travel lanes and one parking lane;
resurfacing of stage one pavement and addition of curb and gutter. For
Upper U.N. Drive stage one improvement comprised at the widening and
resurfacing of the existing pavement, construction of shoulders and side
ditches. Stage two improvement which is to begin in 1985 will provide
for the resurfacing of stage one pavement.



- 33 -
The present re-evaluation of the United Nations Drive improvement is
based on the results of a traffic volume survey conducted on the United
Nations Drive in August and September 1979. Five days of straight volume
counts were taken between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on each of the three sections
except middle U.N. Drive where the counts were taken on four days. Two
nights of volume counts (7 p.m_ 7 a.m.) were also taken. Another two days
of classified volume counts were taken on lower and Upper U.N. Drives.
The results of the traffic survey including the composition and per cent
composition of traffic per road section is presented in Table 18. The
present average growth rates estimated are 5.5 per cent for lower U.N.
Drive; 6.8 per cent for middle U.N. Drive and 8.1 per cent for upper U.N.
Drive. It is assumed that traffic on each section will grow at the above
estimated growth rates up to 1985 and then drop to an average of 5.7 per
cent growth rate thereafter. Traffic projections based on these growth
rates are shown in Table 11.
7.3.1 Project Costs
The actual combined construction and supervision costs for improvement
of the U.N. Drive is given in Table 19. The total project cost has been
adjusted to the 1979 price level by assuming an inflation rate of 11 per
cent.
7.3.2 Project Benefits
The benefits from improvementd' the U.N. Drive include:
a) User savings due to reduction in vehicle
operating costs; and
b) Working Drivers' Time savings
The estimated 1979 user savings from paving (average for all vehicle
types are given as follows:
Upper U.N. Drive           10.3l1 per unit
Middle U.N. Drive           12.10t per unit
Lower U.N. Drive            6.22e per unit
Details of the above estimates are provided in Tables 20, 21 and 22 based

on the vehicle operating costs as at 1979 prices as provided in Table
13. The 1979 saving benefits are estimated as follows:

The yearly saving benefits presented in Table 23 for each section
of the U.N. Drive are projected at the following rates; 5.4 per cent
per annum for Upper U.N. Drive, 5.6 per cent for Middle U.N. Drive and
5.3 per cent for Lower U.N. Drive.
Time savings benefits are calculated by assuming a fifty per cent
increase in the 1975 values. A summary of the calculation is pre-
sented below:

The following growth rates are applied in projecting the yearly benefit
shown in Table 24: 5.4 per cent for Upper U.N. Drive, 5.6 per cent for mid-
dle U.N. Drive and 10 per cent for Lower   l).N. Drive.  The cost and bene-
fit streams for the U.N. Drive improvoment are presented in Table 25.    The
economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) is calculated under the assumption
of a 20 year project life. The calculated EIRR for a two stage upgrading
is 119 per cent as compared with a 36 per cent overill rcturn astimated for
1970.  An evaluation of individual   * tions of the road wns constrained by
the lack of cost inputs.

8.1 ft2     jtous Studies
The feasibility study tbr improvemat of tho Totote-Ganta %.ut .4
completed in October 1973 by consultants. A summary of the results
of the study is reported in Table 20.
An update ot the consultant study as prepared by the Bank appraisal
mission in 1975 revealed economic rates of return of 43 per rent (ex-
cluding driver time savings) and 33 per cent (excluding driver's time
savings) for the Totota-4barnga and Gbarnga-Qanta sectionw roApotiUvely.
The economic rate of return estimated for the entire project was 38 per
cent (excluding driver tilo savings).
B.S Analysis of Traffic Results
The Planning and Programmina reau carried out two seperate traffic
surveys on the project road in January/February 1980 and August 1981.
The 1980 survey was undertaken at four locations to monitor traffic
growth on the new road and to provide data for the economic re-evaluation
of the project. In 1981 the National Traffic Surveys phases I and III
were Implemented in UOntsetrado, Bong, Nimba and Grand Bassa Counties
to gather traffic information on the highway network in these counties
as part of a systematic nationwide traffic study. Two stations were
located on the project road.
In each of the two surveys vehicls- classification oounts and origin
and destination interviews were conducted at specified locations. Where-
as manual counting was essentially used in the 1980 work covering the
periods 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. as well as 7 p.m. - 7 a. m. the 1981 National
Traffic Survey attempted to use automatic traffic counters to obtain 24-
hour counts.
The average daily traffic, ADT, on the Totota-Gbarnga-Ganta Highway
in 1980 varied from 793 vpd at Gbaota to 1920 vpd near Gbarnga. See
Table 27. As compared to these figures the results of the traffic surveys
conducted in 1973 by the consultants during
the feasibility studies on the project road indicated ADT's of 479 vpd at
Gbaota and 93G vpd near Gbarnga. The actual traffic growth per annum at
the counting stations vary from a low of 4.84 per cent for Zeansue to a
hligh of 10.81% in Gbarnga (Table 28). The signiticant differences at the
Gbarnga Station were due to the following factors.
a) The high number of construction traffic observed
during the 1980 survey period on the whole.
b) Expansion of Obasngs city limits to engulf the
Cboazaf S&ttioa



- 36 -
Table 29 shows that there were no significant differences in
traffic volume composition on the project road from 1973 to 1980.
Traffic conditions on the project road had begun to stabilize during
the 1981 surveys. Wet season ADT's of 646 vpd and 430 vpd were recorded
at Gbartala and Palala respectively. These were corrected to ADT of 775
vpd and 516 vpd respectively. The 1981 results indicate higher levels
of taxi traffic on the route. Also there was a lowering of truck traffic
from 1980 probably because of the removal of construction traffic. The
composition of other types of vehicles remained virtually the same.
From the average daily traffic for each of the five counting stations
of 1980 and the two counting stations of 1981, ADT flows for the Totota to
Gbarnga and Gbarng3 to Ganta road sections were computed using the mileage
as a weighting factor. The result is shown below.
TRAFFIC GROWTH RATES ON SECTIONS OF THE TOTOTA-GANTA ROAD
AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC(ADT)    PERCENT GROWTH RATE
Route            1973      1980      1981     1973-1080     1973-1981
Totota-Gbarnga     720     914        775       3.47         0.92
Gbarnga-Ganta      439     793        516       8.81         2.04          ,
Totota-Ganta       581     854        646       5.66         1.33
On the Totota to Gbarnga stretch there was a growth rate of 3.47%
p.a. in traffic from 1973 to 1980. However, traffic volumes actually
fell in 1980-81 by 15.2% p.a. resulting in an overall growth of only
0.92% from 1973 to 1981.
On the Gbarnga to Gint--i stretch there was an initially high growth
of 8.&1% p.a. from 1973 to 1080. But the period 1980-81 registered a
decrease of 34.93% which resulted in an overall growth of only 2.04% p.a
from 1973 to 1981.
The Totota to Ganta highway as a whole, experienced a traffic growth
of 5.66% p.a. from 1973 to 1980 which decreased to 1.33% p.a. from 1973 to
1981. The general decrease in traffic volumes for 1980-81 is a nation-
wide characteristic resulting from the lowering of the level of economic
activity in the country since April 1980 and the imposition of curfew hours
from 1.00 a.m. to 6.00 a.m. each day from April 1980 to May 1982.
Traffic projections based on an estimated 5 per cent per annum and 8
Percent per mnum growth rates for the Totota-Gbarnga and Gbarnga-Ganta sections
are shown in Tables 30 and 31. Generated traffic for the Totota-Gbarnga
section is estimated as 75 vpd as from 1987 with a growth rate 4 per cent
per annum. For the Gbarnga-Ganta section the estimated generated traffic
is 32 vpd in 1987 growing at a rate of 4 per cent per annum.

8.3 ROAD IMPROVEMENT COSTS
The total improvement cost of the Totota-Ganta Road including
construction operations and supervision costs is shown in Table 32.
The total supervision cost including outstanding payments to the
consultants has been spread over the entire construction period except
for thelast year 1982. About seventy-five per cent of all outstanding
payments to the contractors are included in the 1981 construction
figures. An adjustment has been made in the total cost by assuming an
eleven per cent rate of inflation over the construction period.
8.4 Estimates of Benefits and Economic Analysis
The benefits from improvement of the Totota-Ganta Road comprise
and         cost
of savings in vehicle operating costs/maintenance/and drivers' time.
Table 33 presents an estimate of economic vehicle operating costs for
paved and unpaved gravel roads. The estimated transport cost savings
per kilometer from a gravel road (fair condition) to a paved road stand-
ard for the Totota-Gbarnga and Gbarnga-Ganta roads are shown in Table
34 and 35. The transport cost savings are estimated at the 1982 prices
(Second Quarters). The respective yearly transport cost saving benefits
for the Totota-Gbarnga and Gbarnga- Ganta sections are shown in Tables
36 and 37. No adjustment has been made in the 1979-81 benefits for
the Totota-Gbarnga section althoughit was completed in March 1979.
Drivers' time savings have been excluded due to the lack of
detailed information required to update same. The estimated maintenance
cost savings given in the appraisal report have been maintained in the
re-evaluation. Table 38 shows the streams of cost and benefits for the
road project. The calculated economic internal rate of return is 32.
percent compared with 38 percent estimated in 1975.

1979              3,412                  2,248
NOTE:   The method of payments to consultants and the accounting procedure
adopted during the construction of the project makes it almos' im-
possible to distinquish between construction operation and construction
supervision costs. It is reported that payments were made to the con-
sultants on the basis of the amount of work that was done irrespective
of project type since both the bridge and U.N. Drive projects were
supervised by the same consultants. For the analysis supervision cost
has been equally distributed over the construction period since yearly
disbursement records were not available at the time of the preparation;
of this report. Since the bridge project was completed in 1979 all
payments made in 1980 have been included in the 1079 cost. The actual
cost includes both construction operation and construction supervision
costs.
