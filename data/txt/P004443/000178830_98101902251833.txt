REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A
SECOND INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT CREDIT PROJECT
THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for an equivalent of US$75 million.
The loan would have a term of 18 years including 4 years of grace and an
interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be
relent to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) on the same terms
as those of the Bank loan for onlending to specific productive enterprises.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1974. A basic economic mission
visited the Philippines in April/May 1975 and is now preparing its report.
The discussion below includes the findings of the mission. Annex I of this
report contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        During the 1960's the economy grew in real terms at the rate of
5-6 percent per annum. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the bene-
fits of growth were not distributed widely and unemployment rose. Low levels
of taxation resulted in inadequate public investment in necessary infrastruc-
ture and social services. Relatively weak export performance, combined with
a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic industry, resulted in
a steady deterioration in the balance of payments position.
4.        During 1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group, they succeeded in improving substan-
tially the maturity structure of the external public debt. Real GNP during
that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972, following severe
floods, the President began a series of social and economic reforms in the
country including an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an administra-
tive reorganization. These programs are beginning to show results.
5.        In 1973, there was a sharp increase in the level of economic acti-
vity in the Philippines. This upsurge was led by the international commodity
boom, which resulted in higher export incomes in the Philippines, a strong
recovery in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market
and an expansion in public and private investment. The growth in real GNP
doubled to 10 percent.



- 2 -
6.        Like most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines proved quite vulnerable
to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices and the
prolonged recession in the industrialized countries. This sequence of events
has temporarily frustrated the Government's attempt to accelerate the rate
of development, and in 1974 GNP increased by only about 6 percent in real
terms. While adverse effects of the recession were cushioned somewhat in
1974 by a modest improvement in the external terms of trade, the Philippines
has been even more seriously affected in 1975 by the continued rise in
import prices and reduced demand for Philippine exports. The real growth
of GNP in 1975 is not expected to exceed the level of the previous year.
Improvement in the growth performance in 1976 can be expected only if recovery
takes place in the economies of the Philippines' main trading partners.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2 percent
per year during the 1970s, a period which has been affected by unusually
adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 percent in
1973-74, but due to serious damage by typhoons, it grew by only 1 percent
in 1974-75, and the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half
of 1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, initial indications are that
the outlook for rice production in 1975-76 is bright. The Government is
giving the highest priority to increasing agricultural production and has
initiated a number of programs designed to expand the use of fertilizer,
irrigation and supervised credit. It has also intensified efforts to expand
social services needed in rural areas, including rural electrification, health
and family planning services as well as small-scale road and irrigation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has moved ahead with its agrarian reform program for the nation's
one million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By mid-1975, land trans-
fer certificates had been issued to nearly 200,000 tenants and progress had
been made on land valuations and the transfer of titles. The Government has
raised the cash portion of the compensation package to landlords to reduce
their resistance to land reform, but strong administrative efforts will be
necessary to ensure continued progress in the implementation of the Program.
9.        Industrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973 was
adversely affected in 1974 by the world-wide economic slowdown and grew by
only 3.6 percent in 1975. This sector, which is discussed more fully in
Part III of this report, has good growth prospects.
10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently about 3
percent compared with 1. tpercent in FY72. The Government has also implemented
a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax administration.
These reforms aided by the increased economic activity, the boom in export
incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase in
national government tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in



FY74. As a result, the ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP
has increased from an average of 9 percent in recent years to an estimated
12.3 percent in FY74. However, because of lower growth of foreign trade
and domestic incomes the ratio fell to about 11.5 percent in FY75.
11.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines and in 1974 consumer prices rose by almost 40 percent.
The rise was caused by the large increase in liquidity that came with the
export boom in 1973-74, and by a number of cost-push factors, including the
higher rate of world inflation. To deal with this problem, the Government
adopted contractionary monetary and fiscal policies, and attempted to reduce
the impact of inflation on consumers by subsidizing such essential goods as
wheat, imported rice, and cooking oil. As a consequence of the Government's
measures, the annual rate of inflation decreased to less than 20 percent at
the end of 1974 and less than 10 percent as of mid-1975.
12.       The rapid inflation in 1974 exacerbated the decline in real wages
which had begun in 1970. Overall, there was a decline of about 20 percent
in real wages during 1974. In order to offset the deterioration of real
wages in urban areas, the Government increased the salaries of Government
employees and directed private firms to grant emergency cost of living ad-
justments to employees earning less than P 600 per month. Nevertheless real
urban wage incomes declined and reduced the demand for manufactured products,
which contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing sector in
1974. The depression in the urban areas was partly offset by the improvement
in rural incomes that stemmed from continued high prices for agricultural
commodities.
13.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments benefitted
considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973. High
prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products, sugar,
copper and wood products resulted in a 70 percent boost in export earnings
and a balance of payments surplus of about $670 million. Since mid-1974 the
external trade position has deteriorated due to the sharp increase in the
price of oil and other imports and less favorable prices for Philippine
exports. In 1974, imports nearly doubled while exports rose by only about
50 percent and as a result the balance of payments surplus fell to about
$100 million. However, international reserves at the end of 1974 remained
comfortably high amounting to about $1.2 billion, equivalent to roughly four
months imports.
14.       Due to the prevailing recession in the economies of the Philippines'
main trading partners, there will probably be a 20 percent deterioration in
the terms of trade during 1975 resulting in a decrease in export earnings of
about 10 percent. As the import volume is estimated to rise only marginally,
partly as a result of the domestic recession, the value of imports will
probably rise by not more than 15 percent. The net result of these projected
trends is probably that the Philippines may have an overall balance of
payments deficit of about $350 million in 1975 and $220 million in 1976.
These deficits can be managed without serious pressure on reserves through



- 4 -
utilization of the IMF oil facility (and possibly in 1976 of the extended
facility of the IMF) and by short-term foreign borrowing by the Central Bank.
15.       The overall level of debt of the Philippines is expected to remain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
would average about 16 percent during the rest of this decade. At present,
the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is about 8 percent and its share
in debt-service is about 5 percent. These shares are expected to increase
slowly in the years ahead.
16.       Foreign assistance is expected to continue to be of major import-
ance in helping to finance the larger investment expenditures which will be
necessary for the country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement
of external assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of develop-
ment expenditures which will be required during the latter part of the decade,
total commitments will need to be maintained in real terms at least at the
level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The Consultative
Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on October 1, 1975, agreed
that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Government to seek aid commit-
ments of about $600 million during 1976.
Growth Prospects
17.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy which is primarily
a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains committed
to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide for a
continued increase in incomes and employment. High priority must be accorded
to expanding employment opportunities - in the short-term as well as the
long-term - because unemployment and underemployment are still high and the
labor force continues to grow at 3 percent a year.
18.       Priority must also be given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding industrial export production and to accelerating
development of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during
the last two years in importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable
prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to
achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn as soon as possible. The Govern-
ment rightly recognizes that the increased cost of petroleum and other
imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad and it is
actively encouraging both local and foreign investors to expand the product-
ive capacity of export industries and to undertake major new import-replacing
investments. Because it will take time for these investments to have an
impact on the balance of payments, the Government is seeking increased
support from the international financial community to help carry out its
development program and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other
import prices. Because of the substantial easing of the external debt burden
which has taken place in the last several years, the Philippines now has the
capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital in support of its
development program.
19.       Given the likely availability of resources and the expected growth
in various sectors, it is reasonable for the Government to plan for a longer



- 5 -
term growth in GNP of about 7 percent a year in real terms. To achieve
this objective increased investments will be needed in a wide range of
industries. Public investments also need to be increased. A new public
infrastructure program is being prepared, and the Government is putting
emphasis on developing nuclear and indigenous power sources and on irrigation,
feeder roads and other projects to support increased food production. The
Government has made considerable progress in recent years in building up the
capacity of public sector agencies to prepare and execute projects. However,
there will be a need for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of
administration. The ratio of public investment to GNP will need to rise
from the present level of 3 percent to about 5 percent by 1980. To support
the level of investment, the Government will need to intensify its tax
efforts so that the ratio of national taxes rises from its present level of
11-12 percent to 14 percent by 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
20.       The Philippines has received 31 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $722.2 million, net of cancellations. About 40% of the Bank/IDA
lending, $293 million, has been for infrastructure projects in power, trans-
portation, and water supply whilst $38 million has been for population and
education. Of the remainder about $216 million has been for agriculture and
about $175 million for industry in four loans for the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines, one loan for the Development Bank of the
Philippines and one for small and medium industries. There has been a marked
improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have been
executed in the last three years compared with experience in the 1960s when
shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration to
cause serious problems. All these projects are now going reasonably well.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of October 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
21.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the increased Philippine development effort with its particular emphasis on
agriculture and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues led to low
investment for these purposes in the past. The last three years have seen
major changes which have helped to overcome these constraints and both the
ambitious Philippine development program and the Bank's lending program have
been designed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs. Commit-
ments in FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, and in FY75 $208 million compared
to an average of about $30 million a year in the preceding five years.
22.       One loan of $42 million for the Magat Irrigation project has already
been approved by the Executive Directors in FY76. In addition to the proposed
project, other projects which may be ready for Board consideration in FY76
include livestock, fisheries, grain storage, education, urban development and
irrigation.



- 6 -
23.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.2
million for investments in 13 companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of October 31, 1975, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $3.4 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $54.2 million. On the
same date $2.1 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
The Industrial Sector
24.       Industry (defined as manufacturing, mining and construction) is
the third largest sector in the Philippine economy (after agriculture and
services). In 1974, it accounted for almost 30 percent of net domestic
product, absorbing over one-third of total fixed investment and providing
employment for 15 percent of the total labor force. Manufacturing is by
far the largest component of the industrial sector, and in 1974 accounted
for 20 percent of net domestic product and for 10 percent of the labor
force. Manufacturing enterprises are predominantly privately owned, and
generally concentrated in large scale, vertically integrated, capital
intensive units. Food and beverages are the largest manufacturing group,
followed by chemicals and petrochemicals, and textiles. Geographically,
over 65 percent of manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in the
Greater Manila and southern Luzon area, although industrialization has
been increasing in northern Mindanao and the Western Visayas.
25.       Historically, Philippine industrial production was geared pri-
marily to meeting the needs of the domestic market and there has been a
heavy reliance on protection policies applied through the tariff system
and some degree of import control. In the late 1960s, the Government
became aware of the problem implicit in this approach and through the
Investments Incentives Act of 1967 and the Export Incentives Act of 1970
has sought to diversify the traditional industrial base and to expand
exports and industrial employment. Both Acts are administered by the Board
of Investments (BOI) in the Department of Industry (DOI). Under these Acts
incentives are provided to enterprises which are undertaking productive
investments in those industries which are set out in BOI's annually revised
investment and export promotion plans. However, there is growing doubt
as to whether these policies have been fully successful in overcoming the
effects of the earlier protectionist policies, and the National Economic
and Development Authority (NEDA) and DOI are currently studying this matter.
For the future the Government's industrial stategy is designed: to expand
investments in a few large-scale projects such as wood processing, fertilizer,
and copper smelters which will contribute to a major expansion of exports
or a reduction in imports; to encourage projects to strengthen and diversify
non-traditional exports and allow for greater integration in existing
industries; and to emphasize the promotion of small and medium industries



- 7 -
to boost employment generation, encourage regional dispersal of industry
and bring production closer to raw materials and markets.
26.       The growth rate of the industrial sector fell to 3.5 percent in
1974 compared to 12 percent during the previous year. This decline is
primarily a result of depressed demand for Philippine exports on the part
of the country's main trading partners and the concomitant slowdown in the
rate of economic growth in the Philippines. Nonetheless, the longer-term
prospects for industrial growth are very favorable, because of the existence
of the natural and human resource endowments of the Philippines and a very
active private sector. In recognition of these prospects, applications for
planned investments in 1974 were more than twice the level of the previous year.
27.       The Four Year Development Plan for FY75-78 estimates that total
industrial investment in the period will be about $3.3 billion. The estimates
for the period 1976-80 are about $7.4 billion, or about triple the level of
investment in the period 1972-75. Investment in manufacturing is expected
to account for about 90 percent of this. These levels of investment will
require a large and sustained increase in domestic resource mobilization,
as well as a steady inflow of foreign capital on reasonable terms.
Industrial Finance
28.       The Philippines has a well-developed financial system, but there
are insufficient long-term funds available to finance industrial investment.
DBP and the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) are
the main sources of such finance, and they provide about 95 percent of the
long-term finance available to the private sector in the Philippines. Working
capital needs are financed mainly by commercial banks, which in 1974 provided
$3.6 billion in domestic credit, 30 percent of which went to the manufacturing
sector. The remaining gaps in financing are covered by internally generated
funds and by equity financing through the capital market. The two long-term
financing institutions, DBP and PDCP, accounted for less than 8.5 percent
of the Philippines total net financial assets which stood at $12.6 billion
at the end of 1974. This low proportion reflects the predominance in the
Philippines of institutions and markets dealing in short-term funds. In
order to help strengthen the financial sector, the Government has requested
the assistance of the Bank, IFC and the IMF to undertake a series of studies
of the capital market and the commercial banking system. The proposed loan
is expected to help increase the availability of long-term capital in the
Philippines by providing financial and institutional support to DBP in its
efforts to expand its long term lending to high priority industrial projects.
29.       The proceeds of the first loan through DBP (Loan No. 998-PH) have
been used to finance a wide variety of sub-projects in textiles, chemicals,
energy, edible oil processing, wood processing, milling, mining, machine
tool manufacturing and other manufacturing. These sub-projects have estimated
economic rates of return ranging from 11% to 80%. The internal financial
rates of return for these sub-projects varied from 14% to 50%. DBP expects
to approve projects utilizing the entire $48 million available under the
first loan by the end of November.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed loan is the eighth in a series of Bank Group loans
for financing industrial investment in the Philippines. The most recent of
these was a $30.0 million Bank loan for the development of small and
medium industry which was approved in May 1975 (Loan 1120-PH). The proposed
project was appraised in May 1975 and negotiations were held in October
1975. The leader of the Philippine negotiating team was J.V. de O'Campo,
Acting Chairman, DBP. The Appraisal Report (No 872a-PH) on the project is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides
a loan and project summary.
31.       The proposed loan of $75 million would help finance the foreign
exchange costs of capital goods imports for medium and relatively large
industrial sub-projects. Eligible enterprises would include those engaged
in manufacturing, agro-industries, mining, ocean shipping and tourism.
The proceeds of the loan would be directed mainly towards investments
which would: further diversify the non-traditional export base; encourage
greater domestic value-added through domestic processing of traditional
exports; and encourage intermediate and capital goods production.
32.       In addition to increasing the availability of medium and long-
term resources for medium and large scale enterprises in the Philippines,
the proposed loan would continue the process, begun under the first in-
dustrial investment credit loan, of assisting DBP to make institutional
improvements. These would include improvements in the caliber of DBP's
industrial projects department staff, and its project appraisal and follow-up
procedures; a strengthening of DBP's long-term resource base; and an improve-
ment in DBP's financial performance. The project would also provide for
material improvements in the quality of DBP's audits which are carried out
by the Commission on Audit (COA) and the Central Bank (CB).
33.       At the request of the Government, the proposed loan would, as in
the case of previous loans for DBP, be made to the Government which would
relend the proceeds of the Bank loan to DBP on the same terms as those of
the Bank loan. Within DBP the proposed loan would be handled by Industrial
Projects Department I (IPD I) as was the case with the first loan. Both
the Bank loan and the subsidiary loan from the Government to DBP would be for
18 years including a grace period of 4 years at an interest rate of 8.5 per-
cent per annum. In accordance with Philippine law, the relending rate charged
by DBP to sub-borrowers would be 12 percent per annum for loans secured by
land and 14 percent for loans which are not so secured (See Section 4.08 of
the Loan Agreement). Sub-loans would be committed over the next two years
and disbursed over four years. They would be for a maximum term of 15 years,
including an appropriate grace period. Sub-borrowers would assume the foreign
exchange risk on the currencies of the countries from which goods and services
are procured. The Government would bear any residual exchange risk between
the currency of procurement and the currency of obligation, for which Govern-
ment would charge DBP a fee of 0.75 percent per year on amounts outstanding



on the Bank loan (see Schedule 3 of Loan Agreement). A ceiling of $5 million
would be set for any sub-loan made by DBP for an individual investment
project under the proposed loan (See Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement). As
under the first industrial loan to DBP, sub-loans of less than $1 million
would be made without the Bank's prior approval. The aggregate limit of such
sub-loans would be $30 million (see Section 2.02(b) of the Loan Agreement).
Based on experience with the average size of industrial sub-loans under the
first loan, it is estimated that with this free limit, about 70 percent by
number or 85 percent of the amount of DBP's sub-loans would require the prior
approval of the Bank staff. This would enable Bank staff to closely monitor
the progress of the project.
34.       DBP, established in 1958 as a wholly Government-owned development
Bank, operates in all the important sectors of the economy. The bulk of
DBP financing, including guarantees and equity investments, has gone to
industry which accounts for about $2 billion or 70 percent of total com-
mitments. The balance of about $800 million is accounted for by agriculture,
real estate and other sectors, including lending to municipalities and
private development banks. DBP's financing in the past two years accounted
for about 13 percent of total fixed investment in the Philippines, and its
industrial financing for 26 percent of total investment in the industrial
sector. In addition to its financing, DBP has also helped to promote
investment in low-cost housing and has assisted in the establishment of
provincial private development banks and the Greater Manila Terminal
Food Market. Because of the size of its financing and the wide variety
of its activities, DBP has played and is expected to continue to play
a central role in the economic development of the Philippines.
35.       DBP's present management has continued its efforts to strengthen
the institution and to raise the standards of its operations. While there
has been some necessary movement of experienced staff, particularly from
IPD I, to bolster weaker departments, the overall quality of DBP's management
has generally improved. DBP has expanded its professional staff by 30 per-
cent since December 1973, and reduced its services staff by 1.5 percent
over the same period. IPD I had a total staff of 62 as of April 30, 1975.
Since then it has employed 21 additional staff and expects to complete
recruitment by the end of 1975 to fill the authorized positions still vacant.
IPD I is recruiting mainly recent graduates, and DBP is developing suitable
training programs both internally and with the Development Academy of the
Philippines (DAP) to enable new staff to become fully operational as soon
as possible. In the past year, DBP staff have also made training visits
to other DFCs to study their operating systems and adapt them for DBP's
use. During negotiations, improved procedures for loan appraisal and
supervision were informally agreed upon and the impact of these on IPD I's
operations will be closely monitored by the Bank.
36.       DBP's lending operations have increased particularly rapidly in the
last year and reached an unprecedented level of $324 million in FY75, compared
to $39 million in FY74 and $31 million in FY73. In addition to a major
and unusual increase in hotel lending operations, DBP's lending increased



- 10 -
in other sectors, especially industry. This increase offset a deliberate
reduction in DBP's guarantee operations which declined from $373 million
in FY74 to $123 million in FY75. Equity investments, mainly in government
enterprises, were approved for amounts totalling $28 million in FY75, a much
higher level than in the previous two years.
37.       DBP's financial position is reasonably sound.   As of June 30, 1975,
DBP's total assets stood at $1.0 billion and its contingent liabilities
(outstanding guarantees) totalled $467 million. Its liquidity position is
secure (current ratio 1.3 as is its present long-term capital structure
(long-term debt-equity ratio 3.8:1). In order to increase DBP's long-term
domestic resources, Government is paying in an additional $100 million (P 750
million) in the next two years to increase DBP's equity. In addition, the
Government will convert P 400 million in short-term Treasury deposits in DBP
into a loan with a five year maturity (see Section 4.11(c) of the Loan Agree-
ment). The Government has also agreed to make by 1980 satisfactory arrangements
to support DBP's large hotel financing program (see Section 4.11(a) of the
Loan Agreement). To ensure the continued strength of DBP's capital structure,
DBP has agreed for the first time to limit total borrowings and outstanding
contingent liabilities to no more than 10 times its equity base (see Section
4.05 of the Loan Agreement). This limit is considered satisfactory. DBP
has also agreed to set up a special foreign exchange loss reserve account,
and to adopt a reserves policy statement satisfactory to the Bank (see Sections
3.01(b) and 4.07 of the Loan Agreement). DBP's net income for FY75 was $10
million, a decline on an annual basis of 21 percent. This is in contrast to
the rising trend of FY73 and FY74. The decline in income reflected mainly a
decline in collections, as a result of the effects of the economic downturn
in FY75 on many of DBP's clients, and rapidly rising expenses. DBP has agreed
to take the actions outlined in para. 38 in order to improve its financial
performance (see Sections 4.08, 4.09 and 4.10 of the Loan Agreement).
38.       DBP's arrears situation, which has improved substantially over the
past year, continues to need substantial improvement. As of June 30, 1975,
total arrears on the total loan portfolio including interest, amounted to
nearly $75 million or 15.5 percent of the portfolio, compared to 23.5 percent
a year ago; and the number of accounts in arrears amounted to 60 percent of
the total, compared to 57 percent a year earlier. Defaults on guarantees have
required DBP to advance an average of about $53 million annually over the
past four years. These advances, which are immediately due and payable,
amounted to $73 million equivalent as of Mtarch 31, 1975, or 15.6 percent of
the outstanding guarantee portfolio. To reduce arrearages on its loan and
guarantee accounts, DBP launched a major collection effort, beginning in
January 1974, but this was retarded by the economic downturn in FY75. To
alleviate the arrears problem, DBP has agreed to: reschedule all accounts
in need of such action by March 31, 1976; further improve its system of
recording and reporting arrears; establish prompt reminder procedures for
overdue accounts and increase its penalty charges (see Sections 4.08, 4.09
and 4.10 of the Loan Agreement).
39.       DBP's accounts are audited by Government auditors, whose reports,
although thorough in many respects, do not cover certain essential aspects
of DBP's financial condition, namely, the quality of the portfolio and the



- 11 -
adequacy of provisions made for doubtful accounts. Both DBP and the Govern-
ment concur with the views of the Bank staff on the need for improving the
coverage of the audit. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the form,
coverage and timetable for submission of the improved audits. It was also
agreed that in the event audit reports for FY76 and beyond were found to be
unsatisfactory, the government would take all such steps, including the
appointment of outside independent auditors, as necessary to enable the
Bank to make firm judgements about DBP's financial condition (See Section
4.03 of the Loan Agreement).
40.       DBP expects to commit loans and guarantees totalling $580 million
during the two-year period from July 1, 1975. Projected commitment levels
have risen considerably compared to forecasts of 18 months ago, mainly
because capital goods prices have increased at a much more rapid rate than
anticipated. The proposed loan of $75 million would cover just over 50
percent of DBP's total direct foreign exchange commitment requirements over
the next two-year period. DBP would finance the balance through a proposed
loan of $25 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and also hopes to
obtain additional commercial borrowings. DBP's local currency requirements
are expected to be provided by the Government and to some extent through
DBP's internal cash generation and resource mobilization efforts. With the
institutional improvements described in this report, DBP can be expected to
carry out the projected level of operations effectively and to continue to
improve steadily its financial position and performance.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separa-
tely to the Executive Directors. The loan would not become effective until
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement was concluded between the Government and DBP.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
Robert S. McNamara
President

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 637-PH      Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: October 15,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area. The
project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the 1972
floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule. All
work is expected to be completed in 1975 and the loan entirely disbursed by
June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40% over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects of
successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coor-
dination established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services,
the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after comple-
tion of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate.
Also, nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including
lands which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there
has been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the rate of return estimate is now more favorable than at
appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as expalined in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

April, 1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include
corn in addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National
Grains Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline
procurement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed long before the revised
Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness: July 23, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
The project is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Mindanao (160 km.). Construction is only 55% com-
plete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due to
civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing about
20% of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the contractor
being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government proposal
to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually execute
the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund will be
applied to the balance of works which can be completed by contract. The
total cost of the reduced project is estimated to be about US$16.4 million
compared to appraisal estimate of US$15.8 million. The increase in cost is
due to a rise in construction costs which has been substantial since oil
price increases in late 1973. The roadworks are expected to be completed by
the end of December 1975. The other components of the project including
UNDP financed feasibility studies were completed in 1973. The closing date
has been extended from May 15, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Technical assistance
to the Department of Public Highways is continuing with Bank financing under
the Second Highway Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH and Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
Cr. No. 296-PH      and Credit of April 3, 1972; Date of Effectiveness:
July 1, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. After initial delays, the project is
proceeding satisfactorily, and the unit is expected to be commissioned during
the second quarter of 1976. Construction work is continuing on 230 kV
transmission lines. NPC's financial situation has been improved by the
imposition in July 1973 of a surcharge to cover increased fuel costs.
Further tariff increases were approved, effective July 1, 1974 and again
in July 1, 1975, although this last increase still has not received
Presidential approval.
Ln. No. 823-PH      Livestock, US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 9, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the

Page 5
Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six
months because of late appointment of technical staff. Although sub-loan
commitments were slow as a result of this, they are now improving, and all
funds are expected to be fully committed by December, 1975. The project
has expanded the agricultural credit capability of DBP into a new and
important field thus meeting a previously unsatisfied demand for small to
medium scale livestock development finance.
Cr. No. 471-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Ln. No. 984-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project will divert
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir of the first pro-
ject, to provide year-round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central
Luzon. The project also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central
Luzon to inventory water, land, and other resources and identify priority
irrigation projects. Although there has been some delay in constructing the
two diversion dams because of the need for more extensive foundations and
abutment area grouting than originally expected, most difficulties have been
overcome and the work is progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75% of
Aurora water into Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September, 1975, one
year ahead of the appraisal schedule. In the service area, lack of competi-
tion and high bids have delayed awarding of contracts. Urgent work is being
done by Government force account, although the Credit Agreement sets a force
account limit of about 20% on civil works in the service area. Project costs
have increased about 54% over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of
rapid inflation. There would be added benefits from early diversion, however,
resulting in additional water for irrigation sooner than planned, and the
rate of return is expected to fall from 17% at appraisal to 14%.
Ln. No. 998-PH       Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness:  Septemer 9, 1974    Closin  Dte:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direct imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance
(USS2 million) to finance about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. The loan became effective on September 9, 1974. As of September
30, 1975 commitments for sub-loans totalling $35 million had been made.

Ln. No. 1010-PH      Third Rural Credit; US$22.0 million Loan of June 17,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for a
small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These on-lend
the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment in farm
mechanisation, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and equipment,
coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development and cottage-
scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a review by local experts
of the first, second and third rural credit projects. The loan became
effective on August 27, 1974. Collection of arrears by a sizeable number
of participating banks from beneficiaries under the first and second projects
is not satisfactory. This is being watched closely by Bank staff and appro-
priate steps are being taken to improve such collections.
Ln. No. 1034-PH      Sixth Power; US$61.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been con-
tracted and project commissioning is expected by the end of 1976. The
transmission system expansion is also proceeding satisfactorily. NPC raised
its tariffs on July 1, 1974 to meet the covenanted rate of return of 8
percent. But due to inflation NPC was not able to achieve this. NPC
therefore increased tariffs on July 1, 1975, but this increase still has
not received Presidential approval.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government to improve such areas as educa-
tion planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher
training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and farmers. The
project is currently a few months behind schedule, but the delay is being
reduced through action by the project unit on civil works, designs and
equipment procurement. The project is expected to be completed on schedule.
Current problems include unexpected cost overruns (42% higher than the
original estimate), difficulty in introducing reforms in admissions, and
quality standards of project agricultural colleges. The government has
agreed to finance overruns and is considering steps to solve the other prob-
lems. Disbursements are well underway and are expected to remain ahead of,
or on, schedule until project completion.

Ln. No. 891-PH      Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: December 5, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine
and inland fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5,
1973. The demand for loans is adequate, and the organization to implement
them has been properly established. The project is progressing satisfactorily,
and all funds are expected to be fully committed by June, 1976.
Ln. No. 939-PH      Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973
Date of Effectiveness: December 19, 1973; : Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of Mindanao. The
Contract for General Santos was awarded in May 1975 and work has started.
For Cagayan de Oro, a bid has been selected and award of contract is awaiting
Government approval.
Ln. No. 950-PU       Second Highway; US$68.0 million Loan of December 12,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: December 27, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1400 kms.
of roads in Luzon. Work has begun on all fourteen contracts, ten of which
were awarded to local contractors. In line with world-wide inflation, costs
have increased sharply, but price adjustments are being awarded to contractors
by the Government to offset the sharp rises in costs of basic materials,
fuels and labor. The UNDP financed Road Feasibility Studies (Phase II),
for which the Bank is executing Agency, have been completed and a possible
Third Highway project has already been indentified and pre-appraised.
Execution of other minor project items is proceeding generally on schedule.
Ln. No. 1035-PH     Population; US$25.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 13, 1974; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1979
The project is assisting the Government in expanding rural health
infrastructure, staff training facilities, and research and communications
capacity. This will help the Philippines achieve their long-term goal of
fertility reduction. It is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1048-PH      Inter-Island Shipping; US$20 million Loan of October 29,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing
