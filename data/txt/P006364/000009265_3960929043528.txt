1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the State of Sao Paulo with the guarantee of the Federative Republic of
Brazil for US$ 245 million equivalent 18 submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including five years of grace,
with interest at the Bank's standard variable rate, and would help finance
programs to improve learning and reduce dropout and repetition among low-
income children in primary and pre-primary schools in Greater Sao Paulo.
2.        Rackground. Though most children in Brazil today have access to
primary school, only 38 percent make it to the eighth grade, and only 14
percent do so without repeating at least one grade. Nationally, more than
50% of children in the first grade are repeaters. A critical reason for
BDazil'  extraordinarily high repetition and dropout rates is the poor
quality of public primary schools, including, in most urban areas, an
excessively short school day due to overcrowded schools and the need for
multiple shifts. Other causes include a home environment for poor children
that offers inadequate stimulation and encouragement for learning, limited
access of poor children to pre-school education, harsh promotion criteria
for primary school students, and, for some children, lack of energy due to
poor nutrition and undiagnosed physical problems. Primary school
repetition and dropout rates are worst in the Northeast, but the problem
are little different in the urban slums in southeastern Brazil.
3.        In an innovative response to these problems, the State of Sao
Paulo in 1984 introduced a curriculum reform directed at poor children
which provides for automatic promotion as well as continual student
evaluation during the first two grades in order to target special
assistance to slow learners (cclobasico).  In 1988 the state extended the
school day for all children in the first two grades to five hours daily
(iornada unca); however, due to severe overcrowding, especially in slum
areas, only 60 percent cf the primary schools in Greater Sao Paulo have the
physical space to implement the program. To support the cilo baslco and
tornada unica, the state Secretariat of Education (SEE) has also started
complementary programs of in-service teacher training, expanded provision
of educational materials to the first and second grades, and school
construction, rehabilitation and expansion in the urban periphery. Xqually
important, proposed programs of the SEE include expansion of pre-school
education for poor children, through increased support to pre-schools
operated by municipalities or Private Non-Profit Organizations (PWPOs)in
low-income neighborhoods; and establishment of cost-effective school health
services under the jurisdiction of the State Secretariat of Health (S8X).
To strengthen the capacity of the SEE to implement and coordinate these and
other innovations, the SEE needs, over the long run, to decentralize daily
administrative responsibility for the primary school system to the
municipal evel and to develop a capacity to analyze educational policy
alternati js and assess students' learning and achievement   In 1989, the
SEE took a first stop toward the municipalization of primary education,
giving participating municipalities responsibility for contractlRg civil
works and administering the school feeding program.

4.        Ratinale for BOnk Involvement. The Bank's assista.nc  strategy
to Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage growth
and social development in a context of macro-economic stability, with an
emphasis on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the
public sector, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support
systems to the poor. The strategy in educatlon is to complement support
for admlnistrative and structural reforms in the Northeast wlth support for
podagogical and other innovations in the Southeast where capacity to
develop and test such innovations is stronger and where country-wide
education reforms have traditionally begun. Bank support for this project
will help to ensure that the State of Sao Paulo will focus on solutions to
the educational needs of the poor which are well-designed, least-cost, and
based on world-wide experience. It will also ensure that the state will
undertake research to evaluate carefully the impact and cost-effectiveness
of its educational innovations so as to encourage appropriate replicatlon
and adaptation elsewhere in Brazil.
5.        krosect ObJective and Deggrintion. The objective of the project
is to improve primary school learning and retention among children of poor
famLlies in Greater Sao Paulo in a manner that could eventually be adapted
to other Brazilian states. To meet this objective, the project would
supports (a) a new curricular approach and extended school day for the
first two years of primary school, through in-service teacher training,
provision of new educational materials, a more efficient school feeding
program, and school construction to allow primary schools in poor
neighborhocds to operate two five-hour daytime shifts (80% of project
costs); (b) expansion of low cost pre-primary education provided by
municipalities and PNPOs (120): (¢) reform of the school health program to
emphasize screening, referral, and health education (5.5%); (d) strengthen-
ing of the capacity of state and municipal education authorities in
management, planning, and assessment, and the strengthening of the capacity
of PNPOs to provide pre-school services to poor children (l.4%)l and (e)
evaluation studies and dissemination activities (0.6%). A Project Manage-
ment Unit (Unidade de Gerenciamento do Projeto, UGP) located in the SEE
would coordinate project implementation. Departments and agencies within
the SEE and the SE8 (including the Foundation for Educational Development,
FDE, the agency responsible for school construction and dist.ribution of
educational materials), would be directly responsible for project execu-
tion.
6.        The project, to be carried out over six years, provides funds
for civil works, furniture and equipment, pedagogical materials, training,
technical assistance, studies, and incremental operating costs. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$ 600 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$ 76.3 million (13%) equivalent. Retroac-
tive financing of up to US$ 24 million equivalent to cover project start-up
costs is recommended. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Municipalities in Greater Sao Paulo would provide
counterpart funds for the pre-school support program. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown
in schodule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7686-BR dated May 30, 1990, and a
map are also attached.

7.       aEreeA Ati&ons The actions agreed upon as conditions of loan
effectLveneue aret (i) the development of a design for the Lmpact evalua-
tion of the project that is acceptable to the Bank; (ii) that the SEE
legally establish the UGP and staff it with a director and staff whose
experience and qualifications are acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) that
the SUN and FDE enter into arrangements, with terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank, for the purpose of governing  DE 'o activities under
the project, including facilities plannlng and construction of primary
schools, and planning of pre-school facilitLes. No later than three onths
after the date of loan effectiveness, the 83E shall formally issue opera-
tional guidelines satisfactory to the Dank governing the pre-school support
program. No later than December 31. 1991, the State shall sign contracts
with terms and conditions -tisfactory to the Bank with the instLtutions
selected to carry out the three types of evaluation planned (impact, cost
and process evaluations) and specific monitoring activities. Special
conditions of disbursement ares  (i) on the school health program, the
appointment, within the Secretariat of Health, of a full-time program
coordinator with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank;
preparation by the SES of a detailed implementation plan acceptable to the
Dank covering the period 1991 to 1997; and on disbursements on activLties
within the municipality of Sao Paulo, the taking of all steps necessary to
ensure that state and municipal health centers are legally able to under-
take activities in project schools; (ii) on each municipality's pre-school
program, the signing of agreements between the state and the municipallty
counitting municipal counterpart funds, and between the municipality and
PNPOs as necessary; (iii) on the second phase of the training program for
oiclo baaLW teachers, the presentation to the Bank of a plan of specific
activities acceptable to the Bank; and (iv) on the implementation of
activities for the municipalization of primary education, the presentation
to the Bank of a plan of specific activities acceptable to the Bank.
8.        The State has also agreed that:  (i) the State will provide
adequate and timely resources to insure proper maintenance of primary
school facilities in Greater Sao Paulo, that will be equivalent to 1% of
the annually updated value of newly constructed buildings, with funds for
routine maintenance channeled, to the extent possible, through Parent-
Teacher Associations; (ii) the Sn will by September 1 of each year
(starting September 1, 1992) preopare and send to the Bank a detailed report
on the sources and uses of funds for education in the State of Sao Paulo;
and (iii) the State will ensure that the ciclo basicg and iornada unica
are fully implemented on a timely basis in all State primary schools which
have adequate physical facilities.
9.        At the earlier of (i) the date when US$ 70 million equivalent of
Loan funds shall have been committed for constructing, expanding or
refurblshing and equipping primary schools, or (Li) ometime between tay I
and August 31, 1993, the State and the Bank shall review on the basis of
agreed criteria all aspects of the execution of the Project, including a
discussion of the activities to be undertaken for the diessmination of the
results of the Project, and especially an evaluation of the progress
achieved in implementing the cgll basi22 and the Jornada unica. Progress
with respect to the State's policy of devolving to municipalities pro-
primary schools currently operated by the State, such that the number of
pre-schools operated by the State shall have decreased significantly by the
time of the interim review, and progress in increasing the student:teacher
ratio in prlmary schools in Greater Sao Paulo to at least 35:1, will be



4
evaluated. Following this review, the State wlll revise the civil works
implementation plan to the satisfaction of the Bank.
10.       Benefits.  In Greater Sao Paulo, the project will expand by
120,000 the number of pre-school places available to poor children, and is
expected to improve learning of more than 670,000 first and second grade
students annually. The school construction program is targeted to the
lowest-income school districts in the metropolitan area; 90 percent of t1ri
new school places will be in school districts where more than 40 percent of
the households live in poverty (i.e. earn loea than two minimum salaries.)
The project is also expected to establish the effectiveness of a variety of
innovations for improving learning in the early years of primary school
that could be adapted to other regions of Brazil. The project is eapected
to improve the administrative efficiency of state and municipal education
authorities as well as the capacity of public and private agencies to
provide essential social services to children.
11.       Risks.  Implementation risks of the in-school program are
moderate because of reasonably good management capacity of the participat-
ing institutions.  However, the numerous innovativr approaches being
financed and the large number of participating institutions will require
that the SEE play a strong leadership and coordinating role. In addition,
the pre-school support program involves setting up a new institutional
framework in which the state provides guidance and support, and municipal
authorities provide services through their own and PNPO pre-schools. In
order to minimize the risks involved in this new approach, the project
provides funds for technical assistance to strengthen municipal and PUPO
institutions, and funding allocations would be based on annual reviews of
performance. Finally, there will be a mid-term review to assess overall
project execution and make adjustments as necessary.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
