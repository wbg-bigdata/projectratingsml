MEMORANDUM AND RECOMKENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LWAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A THIRD TELECOMNUNICATIMNS PRQJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for $350.0 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate and would help finance the third Telecommuni-
cations Project. The project is expected to be co-financed !ty the KfU of the
Federal Republic of Germany for $169.6 million equivalent, the OECF of Japan
for $28.9 million equivalent, and UNDP for $2 million equivalent.
Backeroun
2.      Domestic public telecommunications services are provided by PERUMTEL
and international services by PT Indosat. The Ministry of Tourism, Posts and
Telecommunications (MTPT) is the regulatory authority for the sector. Despite
substantial assistance from several donors including Belgium, France, the
Federal Republic of Germany,-Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and UNDP over the
past decade, Indonesia's telecommunm'^tions network remains inadequate.
Registered unmet telephone demand is high, access to telephone service in
Indonesia is the lowest among ASEAN countries, and network congestion, Za1l
fa'lures and fault incidence are all high, indicating poor service quality.
PERUNTEL is overstaffed and unit network expansion costs are almost twice
those of other developing countries. There is, therefore, an urgent need to
increase the quantity, improve the quality and reduce the costs of telephone
services in Indonesia.
3.      Both the ongoing technical assistance project (Loan 2757-IND) and the
comprehensive telecommunications sector study (Report 7842-INS) completed by
the Bank in June 1989 have identified major sector deficiencies which include
(a) inadequate sector management by t7le Government and limited participation
by the private sector; (b) PERUNTEL's weak institutional capacity, lack of
commercial orientation, poor management systems and shortage of trained and
motivated staff; and (c) slow and unbalanced expansion of the network,
resulting in an inability to meet growing demand with an appropriate quality
of service.
Government Strategy
4.      The Government's strategy for tolecommunications sector is:
(a) to increase rapidly the quantity and quality of telecommunications
services to meet the growing demand for these services in a cost-
effective way;
(b) to increase the commercial orientation and efficiency of the entities
in the telecommunications sector;



- 2 -
(c) to promote a well-conceived organizational structure, and management
functions, systems and practices that enable PERUMTEL to operate
services efficiently and effectively; and
(d) to promote sound domestic construction, consulting and, where econom-
ically feasible, manufacturing industries to support the telecommuni-
cations sector.
Rationale fgr Bank Involvement
5.      There are three main reasons for the Bank's continued involvement in
the telecommunications sector in Indonesia. Eirst, the Bank's cross-country
experience in the telecommunications sector in developing countries is
directly relevant in advising the Government on sector management and organi-
zation, financing and investment planning.  Saco, the Bank can help to main-
tain a necessary balance between physical and institutional development of the
sector. The Bank's involvement would help alleviate key constraints which
have limited sector development, sector organization and management, and
developing human resources. Major emphasis will be placed on improving cor-
porate management, and developing technical, financial and maintenance sys-
tems. Thi_r, use of international competitive bidding for Bank-financed
equipment and the promotion of competitive procurement for non-Bank financed
equipment would result in significantly lower unit network expansion costs
than in the past.
6.      The Bank's strategy broadly comprises (a) engaging the GOI and the
top management of PERUNTEL in a dialogue on overcoming sector constraints,
(b) developing a pipeline of projects that will emphasize institution build-
ing, and (c) partially financing major investment programs to accelerate
expansion and modernization of the network. Although significant progress is
expected under the proposed project, institutional building objectives can be
fully achieved only in the long term. The proposed project is therefore seen
as the first major effort in a series of Bank operations.
Project Objectives
7.      In line with sector strategy, the objectives of the proposed project
are to:
(a) assist the Government to formulate sector policy and regulations and
to develop appropriate mechanisms for its management of public tele-
communications enterprises;
(b) improve PERUMTEL's institutional efficiency through a program of
human resource development; and
(c) accelerate expansion and modernization of the telecommunications
facilities in the country as a whole, focusing primarily on the seven
major cities: Bandung, Denpasar, Jakarta, Medan, Semarang, Surabaya
and Ujung Pandang.

Project Description
8.      The project has been designed to support the above objectives.  It
comprises technical assistance and investment components.  The tdhnical-
assistance component would (a) enhance the Ministry of Tourism, Posts and
Telecommunications' capability for sector management; (b) support PERUMTEL's
sfforts for human resource development, financial management, materials man-
agement, MIS and training facilities; (c) further develop PERUMTEL's capabil-
ity in undertaking large scale investment programs; and (d) provide 60 over-
seas fellowships to selected PERUMTEL staff. The inmestment comnonent
includes (a) procurement and installation of telecomunuications equipment and
cable to connect about 600,000 lines, (b) establishment of outside plant main-
tenance centers, (c) computerization of netwvrk management, and (d) provision
of equipment and facilities to upgrade the existing training centers.
9.      The Bank loan will partially finance outside plant and technical
assistance. Outside plant includes the supply, delivery, installation and
commissioning of (a) local cable networks, facilities and materials and
(b) interexchange fiber-optic cable, pulse code modulation cable and radio
transmission systems. Technical assistance includes consultancy and training.
In addition, the Bank loan will finance the computer systems for telecommuni-
cations network management and the equipment for upgrading training centers.
The total financing requirement for the project is estimated at $1,150.5 mil-
lion, with a foreign component of $550.5 millio'i (48 percent). A breakdown of
the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project-proeessing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8257-IND, dated March 6, 1990, is
being distributed separately.
10.          Actions Aareed.  The following agreements were reached with GOI
and PERUNTEL.
I.   GOI
(a)   will prepare and furnish to the Bank a timetable for establishing a
legal framework for promoting private sector participation in the
provision of nonbasic telecommunications services and a timetable
for strengthening the capability of NTPT; and
(b)   will take all such actions, including annual reviews and adjust-
ments, if any, of PERUMTEL's tariffs, to enable PERUMTEL to
maintain sound financial health.
II.   PER.UMTEL
(a)   will review annually its tariff to ensure that it will meet the
requirements of para. (a) above and furnish to the Bank a copy of
such review upon its completion, including proposed adjustments in
the levels or structure of its tariffs;



-4-
(b)   will review annually with the Bank its institutional development
plans and investment programs, and consult the Bank prior to under-
taking any investment costing the equivalent of $50,000,000 or more
in any one year not included in the Investment Programs furnished
to the Bank;
(c)   will prepare and furnish to the Bank each year its technical
assistance, management and counterpart training programs and imple-
ment them as agreed; and
(d)   will take actions satisfastory to the Bank to strengthen PERUMTE's
capabilities in the area of: (1) accounting and financial manage-
ment; (ii) operations: (iii) idle capacity utilization; (iv) human
resource development; and (v) training of stdff and managers in
management techniques and new technology.
11.       Conditions of Loan Effectiveness.  The condition of effectiveness
of the loan is that GOI shall furnish evidence satisfactory to the Bank that
co-financing from FRG or other sources on reasonable terms ($115 million
equivalent) to supplement the $54.6 million loans already committed by FRG,
has beeu secured.
12.       B=fits.  Ttle institutional support will improve PERUMTEL's per-
formance as an effective and efficient entity operating on a sound commercial
basis. The investment component would not only satisfy part of the unmet
demand for telecommuni_;ations services, but also substantially reduce network
expansion costs per main line. Increased availabillty of telephone service
and improved quality of service would contribute t rards greater business
efficiency and productivity.  The project would al  develop the local con-
sultancy and outside plant contracting industries   :ough collaboration with
international firms. The economic rate of return L.. PERUMTEL's investment
program, of which the project is part, is estimated at 15 percent.
13.       Risks. The project has been adequately designed and does not
present any significant technical risks. The potential risks for the project
fall into two categories: (a) delays in procurement, and (b) PERUMTEL's
limited capacity to implement the project. These risks have been recognized
and actions initiated to minimize their impact. PERUMTEL has already
established a nucleus project implementation unit and adequate technical
assistance is provided under the project to assist PERUNTEL in the implemen-
tation and supervision of construction works. Residual risks will be mini-
mized by agreed measures to monitor project implementation with corrective
actions initiated as necessary.
14.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
