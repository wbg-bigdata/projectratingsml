PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GREECE - VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING PROJECT
(LOAN 1588-GR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Vegetable
Production and Marketing Project in Greece, for which Loan 1588-GR in the
amount of US$30.0 million was approved on May 6, 1978. The loan was closed
on June 30, 1984, one year later thau expected.   Final disbursement took
place on March 1, 1985, and an unused balance of US$5.1 million was
cancelled.
The PCR consists of an Overview prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Regional Office and a completion report, which was prepared
by the Agricultural Bank of Greece in collaboration with the Ministry of
Agriculture.   The Overview is based on this latter report, a review of the
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 1940-GR of May 5, 1978), the PresIdent's Report
(No.P-2322-GR of May 15, 1978), the Loan Agreement dated July 10, 1978,
correspondence with the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda on project
issues as contained in relevant Bank files.
The efforts on the part of the Agricultural Bank of Greece and the
Borrower's Ministry of Agriculture in preparing the basic completion document
for this project are greatly appreciated.
A copy of the draft repo:t was sent to the Borrower for comments on
October 25, 1985. No comments have been received.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GREECE - VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING PROJECT
(LOAN 1588-GR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Greece became an associate member of the European Economic
Community (EEC) in 1962, and a full member in 1981. Because of the country's
climatic advantages, the horticultural sector was expected to be a major
beneficiary of that membership.  Development of horticulture thus was given
high priority by the Government.
Objectives
The main objectives of the project were to (a) increase foreign
exchange earnings by expanding production of out-of-season vegetables; (b)
strengthen existing research and extension institutions to promote production
of high value crops; (c) help raise productivity of smallholders by promoting
intensive cultivation; (d) promote improvement in the organization of the
export marketing system; and (e) strengthen the Agricultural Bank of Greece
(ABG), by helping to improve its lending operations and resource mobilization
efforts.  To achieve these objectives, the project included construction of
greenhouses on about 900 ha, construction of packhouses and cold storages for
vegetables, provision of refrigerated tractor trailers, improvement of
existing research and extension institutions, and improvement of the
marketing system.
Implementation Experience
The project had a good start, and a number of project activities
commenced even before Board  presentation.   However,  slippage  in project
effectiveness from January 1979 to May 1980 caused implementation delays,
particularly with regard to components invoiving institutional changes. The
loan closing date was extended by one year from June 1983 to June 1984.
Project costs amounted to US$73.3 million, compared with US$84.0 million
estimated at appraisal.   However, in terms of local currency, actual costs
were Dr. 5,590 million, or 82% above appraisal fstimates.   The lower than
estimated project costs in dollars was due to shortfalls in all project
components except the construction of greenhouses, while the additional cost
in drachmas was mainly due to the higher than anticipated internal inflation
coupled with substantial devaluation of the drachma.
Results
Three of the six project components, concerned with horticultural
production  improvements,  were  successful.    Implementation  of components



- iv -
dealing with improvements to the marketing organization was unsatisfactory.
Shortfall in the latter components, together with delays in submitting
disbursement applications in years vihen the drachma was devalued, led to
underutilization of the loan amount, causing the Government to request
cancellatian of US$5.1 million from the proceeds of the loan.  The project's
re-estimated economic rate of return was 29% compared with an appraisal
estimate of 35%.
Sustainability
The prospects for sustainability of benefits from the project's
main investments,  i.e., greenhouses, appear good.   Research and extension
activities supported by the project are expected to be beneficial for the
foreseeable future. Project components related to marketing largely failed.
Although project activities were not greatly hindered as a result, marketing
deficiencies remain a constraint to Greece's overall horticulture development
and will have to be dealt with if the country's comparative advantage is to
be realized.
Findings and Lessons
The main lesson to be learned is that agreement between the Bank
and the Borrower on a set of clear and detailed proposals concerning organi-
zational aspects of institutions to be financed under a project is necessary
before Board presentation, especially when trying to introduce significant
changes involving a number of agencies (in this case, Ministries of Agricul-
ture, Commerce and Transportation).   Close and intensive collaboration in
this project between the Government and the Bank from the initial stages of
the project cycle resulted in significant improvements in ABG's operational
activities and facilitated project implementation (para. 7 of Overview).
Lack of agreement on clear and detailed proposals for the organizational
aspects of regional marketing companies caused project implementation delays
(para. 21 of Overview).
Delays in submission of disbursement applications during the years
when the drachma was devalued caused the Government to lose foreign exchange
from the proceeds of the loan (para. 10 of the Overview). Lack of Bank field
supervision for over 12 months during critical stages for the marketing
component might have exacerbated failure in the Bank reaching an agreement
with the Government on ways to implement that component (para. 41 of
Overview).
Failure to introduce changes in the marketing system does not
appear to have interfered with successful overall implementation of the
project. Though the export through numerous types of growers and traders had
hardly changed since appraisal--the proposed changes in marketing were never
adopted--exports progressed well. The production of cucumbers, the principal
vegetable produced, increased about eightfold in the project area from
1978/79 to 1983/84.  Between 1978/79 and 1982/83 the value of total exports
of fruits and vegetable from Greece increased from US$369 million to US$445
million to the EEC, and from US$37 million to US$62 million to the Middle
East.   Fxndamental struetural changes in a marketing system can hardly be
made over a short period of time (para. 42 of Overview).

VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AND MARKETNG
(LOAN 1588-GR)
IBRI) Overview of Projeot Completion Report
L. Introduction
1.        The attached Project Completion Report (PCR) whi-i was prepared by
the Agricultural Bank of Greece in collaboration with the Ministry of
Agriculture provides a comprehensive description of project implementation and
of the main project achievements and shortfalls. This overview memorandum
comments on points requiring further elaboration. It was prepared by staff of
the Agriculture I Division..
2.        Background.  In 1976, one year prior to project appraisal,
agriculture in Greece accounted for about 17.5% of GDP, contributed with about
322 of total exports and employed about 341 of the total active population.
Fruits and vegetables accounted for about 601 of agricultural exports with
more than half the fruits and nearly all the vegetables being marketed in the
European Economic Community (EEC).
3.        In 1962, Greece became an associate member of the EEC.  Thereafter,
the country's agricultural exports to EEC were exempted from import duties
thus gained a competitive advantage but they remained subiect to quota
restrictions imposed to prevent farm prices from sliding below acceptable
levels. In the mid-70's, Greece applied for full membership in the Community,
which was granted in 1981. As production costs of fresh fruits and vegetables
were lower than those in other member countries due to Greece's climatic
advantages, the horticultural subsector was expected to be a major beneficiary
of Greek's full membership in the Community.
4.        To enable Greek farmers to take full advantage of their competitive
position in the EEC market for fresh produce, a number of complementary
changes were required in the Greek supporting services, particularly as regard
to research and extension, marketing, handling facilities and transportation.
In addition, accession to the EEC called for some changes in agricultural
credit arrangements as well as major changes in Government subsidy policies.
A critical evaluation of Greece's agricultural taxation and subsidy policy was
thus necessary to design them up to the EEC requirements.
5.        Origin and Preparation.  In October 1975, recognizing the need to
develop the production and marketing of horticultural products, the Government



requested I3RD's assistance in preparing and financing a Fruit and Vegetable
Marketing Project. IBRD's reconnaissance and preparation missions (June and
September 1976) reviewed the prospects for export-oriented fruits and
vegetables, identified marketing and production constraints, and proposed
steps for preparing a possible Bank project to assist in the modernization of
the horticulture subsector. Subsequently, the Agricultural Bank of Greece
(ABG) selected a foreign consultancy firm to prepare the feasibility study,
under terms of refereace prepared by ABG with IBRD's assistance. The foreign
exchange cost of the study (about US$300,000) was financed by the Greek
Government from the proceeds of the IBRD Loan 1165-GR (East Vermion Irrigation
Project).
6.        The consultants' report completed in June 1977 constituted a
reasonably good horticulture subsector study, but the organizational aspects,
required changes in Government policies, and cost/benefit analysis needed
further elaboration. Subsequently following discussions with two IBRD
preappraisal missions, the consultants submitted a revised version of the
report, which included sufficient in-depth analysis of abovementioned topics
and served as the basis for the appraisal which took place in October 1977.
One aspect of the preparation report on which the Bank had views different
from those recommended by the consultants and the Government was on the
organizational arrangements for the marketing of vegetables.
7.        During project appraisal, the Bank recommended the Government to
increase the interest rates for agricultural onlending activities and ABG's
capital so as to improve ABG's financial viability. In 1978, and prior to
negotiations, the Government increased the agricultural onlending rates by
0.51 (to 7.52 for short term and 6.5% for long term) and ABG's capital by
about five times. By end 1979, ABG's long-term debt equity ratio was 4.6:1
compared to the 20:1 prevailing at the time of appraisal.  In addition, during
project preparation and appraisal, the Government and the Bank recognized the
need for the Government to carry out a study of interest rates and
agricultural subsidies as the basis for rationalizing its agricultural subsidy
structure and for negotiating the policy changes required for its entry into
the EEC. During negotiations it was agreed that ABG would prepare the study
with the Bank assistance as part of Bank's regular project supervision.
8.        The main objectives of t Le project, as set forth in the appraisal
report, were to (a) increase foreign exchange earnings by expanding production
of out-of-season vegetables; (b) strengthen existing research and extension
institutions to promote production of high value crops; (c) help raise
productivity of smallholders by promoting intensive cultivation; (d) promote
improvement in the organization of the export marketing system; and
(e) strengthen ABG, by helping to improve its lending operations and resource
mobilization efforts. To achieve these objectives, the project included
(a) construction of greenhouses on about 900 ha; (b) construction of
packhouses and cold storages for vegetables; (c) provision of refrigerated
tractor trailers; (d) improvement of existing research and extension
institutions; and (e) improvement of the marketing system. These components
which formed an integrated project, emphasized out-of-season vegetables in
Peleponnesus and Crete, the most important areas for their production. The
project, signed on July 10, 1978, was expected to be implemented between 1978
and 1982.

R. hmplementation
9.        The project had a good start; even before the Loan was signed, the
Government selected, sent, and financed a group of seven agronomists for a
study tour to Israel, Cyprus and France to observe different methods of -
producing out-of-season vegetables. By the end of 1978, ABG had developed new
formats for loan appraisal including financial and ecor.omic evaluation of
subprojects, introduced them for all its medium- and long-term lending
operations, and prepared loan appraisals for all greenhouses to be financed
under the project. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture had selected a
new group of eleven extensionists to receive training in production of
out-of-season vegetables and was very active in selecting the group of
researchers to be sent abroad for long-term training.- The development of the
organizational and implementation plan for the marketing companies to be
established under the project was, however, lagging behind as the Government
was then awaiting the establishment of AGREX, the central state marketing
company which was expected to have a significant role in the export market
organization. It was not until October 1979, that AGREX was formed and the
Government was prepared to consider hiring the required consultants for the
estaLlishment of the marketing companies.
10.       In spite of all the abovementioned progress in steps for project
implementation, it was not until January 26, 1980 that the Loan Agreement was
ratified by the Greek Parliament and the loan became effective thereafter on
May 12, 1980, nearly two years after the loan signature and after four
postponements of the date of effectiveness. This delay in project
effectiveness did cause a loss of momentum in project implementation during
1979 and 1980, mainly of components dealing with institutional changes.
Disbursements against project expenditures incurred during 1978 and 1979 were
also delayed. Moreover, due to such delays, and to the devaluation of the
Drachma during 1978-1980, the Greek Government suffered a loss of foreign
exchange from the proceeds of the loan. This loss was exacerbated by further
delays on submitting disbursement applications to the Bank.  Due to this
phenomenon and to the shortfall on some of the project components, US$5.lM of
the proceeds of the loan could not be utilized in spite of a one-year
extension of the closing date, and this amount was cancelled at the
Government's request. The books were finally closed on March 1, 1985, 20
months after the original June 30, 1983 closing date.
11.       Greenhouses.  The construction of greenhouses under the project
commenced by 1978, and achievements since the project started were close to
the appraisal estimate in spite of the fact that project effectiveness was
delayed by over one years. Construction in Peleponnesus was slower than in
Crete during the first years of the project, but it picked up during project
implementation. Following are the projected (appraisal) and actual area under
greenhouses.

Improvements were introduced in the technical specifications for the
greenhouses financed under the project and those improved specifications were
made applicable for all greenhouse loans provided by ABG even outside the
project area. Most of the greenhouses constructed under the project during
the first years used wooden frame but the trend towards those using metallic
frame or a combination of wood and metallic frame increased during project
implementation, especially for the constructior. of new greenhouses. This
explains, in part, the increase in the average cost per strema of greenhouse
over the project period from US$3,500 during 1978 to US$8,500 during 1984.
Estimated average cost at appraisal was about US$6,600. The wooden frame
greenhouse costed less but had a shorter life. According to ABG estimates,
both types of technology yielded satisfactory financial and economic rates of
return, but returns were reported to be somewhat higher on wooden greenhouses.
12.       By the end of 1982, the original completion date, the project area
covered by new greenhouses (2,314 str) was already higher than that estimated
at appraisal (2,000 str) while replacement of existing greenhouses was about
701 of estimated target (4,964 str versus 7,000 str estimated at appraisal).
Due to the high demand for new greenhouses and replacement of old ones, the
Bank, at the request of Government, agreed to amend the Loan Agreement to
allow construction of new greenhouses on about 3,600 str and replacement of
old greenhouses on about 7,400 str. Thus, the total area under greenhouses to
be financed by the project was increased from 9,000 str to 11,000 str. By
mid-1984, the amended closing date, the project had financed replacement of
greenhouses on 7,050 str and construction of new greenhouses on 3,700 str
bringing the total area financed under the project to 10,750 at str. This
figure is about 19% higher than the one estimated at appraisal.
13.       Packhouses.  The implementation of the packhouses component had a
late start, mainly because of (a) the unexpectedly long periods it took to
identify eligible subborrowers, (b) the traditionally slow process of
decision-making by the cooperatives and/or unions of cooperatives, and (c) the
relatively long period ABG took to prepare tender documents. This was coupled
by the Government's decision, in 1980, to postpone approval of packhouse
subloans until the marketing organizations had been formed. It was not until
1981 that potential subborrowers were finally identified, although marketing
organizations had not been formed. However, approval of subloans was further
delayed because beneficiaries of the packhouse component were unable to
contribute 202 of proposed investment as a down payment contribution required
by Project Agreement. In May 1982, the Government requested the Bank to
modify the Loan Agreement to exempt beneficiaries for this component from the
down payment contribution. The Bank, however, did not agree to th.s proposal



but recommended ABG to require borrowers' contribution as a matter of standard
financial principle of financial soundness and as an indicator of borrower
commitment. To solve the beneficiaries' apparent lack of cash, the Bank
recommended ABG to consider land and labor as borrower's contribution and if
such contributions were not sufficient, to extend loans to individual members
of cooperatives to be used as contribution to proposed investments.
14.       The original implementation schedule included the construction of
six new packhou4es with appropriate cooling facilities and the improvement of
a number of existing packhouses. The actual implementation at project
completion involved the construction of two new packhouses and the improvement
of five existing one. Most of these investments were completed during 1984.
The poor performance of this component appears to be associated with the
continued fragmentation of Greek exports, with most exporters not handling the
volume required to support investments in packhouses (see para 17).
15.       Refrigerated Tractor-trailers.  At the time of appraisal it was
recognized that although overall existing fleet capacity was adequate to
transport expected future exports, there was a need to upgrade and replace
existing units with modern tractor-trailers. According to appraisal
estimates, about 40 to 50 tractor-trailers were expected to be procured under
the project. This component was initially delayed because the Project
Agreement required the potential subborrowers to be experienced trucking
companies whose main activities included the export of fresh horticultural
produce. That requirement narrowed considerably the potential subborrowers by
excluding private individuals licensed to be engaged in the trucking
business. It also excluded the possibilities of new companies. These
requirements were relaxed during 1981 and 1982 to allow subloans for new
companies and for private individuals. The amendments also allowed ABG to
exceed the limit of five tractor-trailers per beneficiary.
16.       At the end of the project period, 21 subloans were signed for this
component comprising seven refrigerated tractor-trailers, four tractors and
12 refrigerated trailers. In addition, one application for Eurokreta,
approved by ABG in 1981, for the purchase of 16 tractor-trucks was not
effective because the company was unable to obtain a license from the Ministry
of Transportation to engage in the trucking business. The major reasons for
the shortfalls on this component could be summarized as follows:
(a)   General slackening of demand for trucks following reduction in
business with the Middle Eaaj. There y   an apparent surplus
of refrigerated trucks reported in Gteece in 1981;
(b)   The Government delays in granting licenses to new large
companies which blocked the financing of 16 trucks under the
project;
(c)   Failure to form large fruit and vegetable export marketing
companies which could have utilized refrigerated trucks more
effectively; and
(d)   Very high taxes (about 45%) on imported new trucks, which
encouraged purchases and importation of reconditioned trucks
which could not be financed under the project. It was,reported



-6-
that, during 1983, about 700 used trucks were imported into
Greece from Germany. Used truck costs (including import
duties) were reported to be between Dr. 2.0 to 2.5M against Dr.
5.8M for new ones.
It could be concluded that, although this component fell short of appraisal
estimates, it does not appear to have been a major constraint in the
development of horticultural exports. However, eligibility of imported used
trucks for project financing could have improved implementation performance of
this component while it would have also helped the project to have a greater
impact in the modernization of the transportation services for fruits and
vegetables. This possibility, although feasible, was never explored by the
Bank or the Borrower.
17.      Marketing Organizations.  The marketing system in Greece is composed
of different forms of organizations including:
(a)   individual growers or grower partnerships actively selling
their own produce in distant markets;
(b)   individual growers who also own one or more packhouses and
export production of other growers;
(c)   private exporters (not growers) with or without packhouses;
(d)   marketing cooperatives and unions of cooperatives; and
(e)   producer groups, highly or loosely organized;
This situation has hardly changed since the time the project was appraised.
There are still too many exporters of fresh fruits and vegetables in Greece;
about 3,500 private exporters and about 1,000 cooperati'.,s have the right to
export. This number was to have been reduced by more strict licensing, but
existing private exporters have successfully lobbied against tightening the
export regulations.
18.      In the preparation report, the consuitants recommended the formation
of a number of regional export marketing agencies. These were to be
commercial trading companies whose shares would be offered to cooperatives and
private exporters as well as to AGREX and ABG. Membership was to be voluntary
and encouraged by limiting government incentives to regional export marketing
agency members. There was also to be a Central Export Coordinating Committee
which, however, was not to have a trading function, but have overseas agents
to provide market information to regional agencies. The report also proposed
the introduction of an auction system at the wholesale stage of marketing in
large urban centers.
19.      During appraisal, the Government's concept was to promote a number of
strong regional vegetable cooperatives and to rely on AGREX to sell their
produce. The reasons for this strategy were partly to emulate the relatively
successful operations of the Macedonian cooperatives in exporting peaches 1/
1/ Peach exports are a special case, where packhouses are grouped on the
railway line near Thessalonika, and exports sent by INTERFRlGO wagons.



-7-
and partly due to a strong preference for cooperatives. It was clear,
however, that most cooperatives in Greece were weak and that a vegetable
export marketing strategy based upon regional marketing companies should plan
to build on dynamic sectors (such as producer groups and individual exporters)
as well as on the cooperatives. Hence, the Bank proposed that membership in
the regional marketing companies be opened to all these groups.
20.      The second major point of discussion at appraisal was the function of
the Central Export Marketing Company proposed by the Government. This role
was to be undertaken by AGREX, a company owned 60% by ABC. In contrast to the
Gqvernment'8 proposal, the preparation report proposed, and the Bank agreed,
that the Central company should have a coordinating and service role rather
than a sales function. The reasoning was that the regional companies should
themselves be responsible to their shareholders for their own business and not
accept directions from third parties from what would be in effect a "marketing
board".
21.      ABG and the Bank reached agreement during appraisal on the following
common premises:
(a) larger unit marketing companies with grower shareholders;
(b) provision of experienced management through technical
assistance, funded initially by the Government;
(c) with some reservations, a two-tier structure, i.e., regional
and national levels.
The main disagreements centered, however, on the need to broaden the
eligibility of shareholders and on the level of regional decision making.
Finally, agreement was reached to set up four regional companies. The
operational features of the companies were, however, left to be agreed during
project implementation.
22.      During project implementation the Bank consistently urged ABG to
expedite implementation of the marketing component. However, legislative 1/
and other delays, 2/ most of which were outside ABG's control, slowed down the
formation of the companies and the hiring of consultants. It was not until
December 1981 that the consultant for this component was finally hired.
Meanwhile, in 1981, political changes took place in Greece 3/, and ABG in its
attempt to implement this component went progressively closer to the
Government's original proposal based mainly in the cooperative system for the
formation of the marketing companies. The lack of Bank field mission from
October 1980 to February 1982 to supervise this project might have exacerbated
failure in reaching an agreement with the Government on ways to implement that
component (para 41 of overview).
23.      Thus, the marketing component has not been successfully implemented
largely because the Government, mainly the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce
and Transport, took up to 1982 to agree on a common export marketing strategy

and to approve the necessary laws and regulations. In addition, the different
proposals submitted to the Bank since 1982 had a number of features, mainly
concerning eligibility for shareholding in the proposed regional companies and
the functions of the Central Export Marketing Company, which were not
acceptable to the Bank. These proposals were similar to those which had been
earlier presented to the Bank at appraisal and considered inadequate for
promoting vegetable exports because they (a) were mainly based on the
cooperative sector and excluded the already well-developed private exporters;
and (b) required compulsory marketing of produce through the regional
marketing organizations.
24.       Currently, the Government has included in its five-year plan a
project to establish regional markets (15 or 20 in all) at which all fruits
and vegetables would eventually be required to be marketed. Growers will
bring their produce to be graded and auctioned. The objective of such a
system is to encourage competitive price formation and standardization. The
Government plans to hire foreign experts to advise on how to combine the
functions of establishing these regional markets and improving exports. The
coac of establishing such a system is expected to be financed by the EEC and
the Government. A proposal with a number of similar features to this one was
prepared by the project financed consultant and submitted to the Bank in 1982
for Bank financing (para 23). In addition, the auction market on a compulsory
basis does not appear to be the best solution to the problem of organizing the
large number of existing individual small exporters in the Greek context.
25.       Extension Activities.  Under the project, a good initiative was
taken in implementing the extension component, mainly in the areas of
greenhouses management, increased capacity for local training, increased farm
visits, and increased awareness and knowledge of problems and solutions of
vegetable production in greenhouses. Most of the equipment and facilities
provided under the project were delivered or constructed by end 1981. In
addition, 25 man-months of foreign consultancy services were provided between
1980 and 1982.  Out of the 33 man-years of ove.seas training for extension
staff provided under the project, about 18 man-years were taken up, and two
study tours were arranged for extension officers to visit modern greenhouses,
market organizations and extension institutes in various European states. A
total of 27 agronomists took part of such training for a period of about
20 days each. Four plastic houses, 2 for each demonstration center (at
Kalamatra, Peleponnesus and Messara, Crete) were also constructed under the
project and are now being intensively used for local training.
26.       Failure to utilize all the training provided for under the project
was mainly due to language difficulties of qualified agronomists and the
difficulties they encountered in securing places in foreign universities.
27.       The two consultants hired under this component participated in
developing the training program abroad, the local training activities of both
staff and growers in greenhouse management, and the revised list of equipment
for the extension component. In addition, they emphasized the need for, and
collaborated in, establishing a soil, plant and water laboratory service in an
effort to determine, as a matter of urgency, nutritional requirements and
measures for solving salinity problems. The consultants made sound
recommendations to meet specific growers' concerns, only stopping short of
proposing general measures for e'eablishing a more intensive extension program.



-9-
28.       Following the departure of the extension consultants, farmers'
training has been provided by previously trained Greek agronomists in
collaboration with the research consultant assigned to Peleponnesus. Local
training is provided to agronomists and growers at demonstration centers and
involves various aspects of management of vegetables in greenhouses.
29.       Research.  After a slow start, increasing emphasis in research
activities was placed on greenhouse heating, screening of cold resistant
varieties, changes in date of planting, crop varieties, nutritional aspects
and other cultural practices. Foreign training was provided to 11 trainees
for postgraduate studies (eight for M.S. and three Ph.D. degrees). Three
foreign consultants, two part time in Crete and one full time in Peleponnesus,
were engaged under the project. The two short-term consultants reviewed the
ongoing research operations and recommended certain changes in research
emphasis, most of which were implemented during the project periods. The
contribution of the full-time consultant assigned to Peleponnesus proved to be
more fruitful as he was able to recommend, plan, and implement a number of
research activities. His emphasis on trials on heating at different
temperatures and with different sources of heat, double cropping, crop
varieties, date of planting, and other cultural practices has proven to be
very successful. It is expected that some of the results of the trials could
be transferred, with some modifications, to Crete. His input was also
reflected in the ceaching qualities of his Greek counterparts. The main
results of the research programs were presented at special meetings
(specifically organized for the purpose of this project) to researchers,
extensionists and other relevant personnel during 1980, 1982 and 1984.
Results are being disseminated tr farmers through the extension system. These
meetings have proven to be very useful, and the Government plans to continue
them every two years in the future.
30.       Twenty-four greenhouses of half a strema each have been constructed
for research purposes, of which six are in Peleponnesus and the remaining 18
in Crete. From the equipment and vehicle list envisaged for this component at
appraisal, only the vehicles and small chemical testing equipment were
procured before the project closing date. Delay in procuring the remaining
equipment was due to bureaucratic procedures needed to be followed in the
preparation and approval of tendering documents.
31.       Study on Interest and Agricultural Gubsidies.  The terms of
reference and technical framework for the study were prepared by ABG's team of
experts with Bank assistance on March 1979. During preparation of the study,
three Bank one-expert missions visited Greece to review the status of
preparation and the analytical approach of the study. It was finally
completed and submitted to the Bank on September 1980, nearly one year behind
schedule. The report provided good background information on the historical
development of agricultural institutions and policies, and on other aspects of
agricultural development. TLe background information was, however, not fully
utilized in evaluating the impact of the various policies on agricultural
development and in formulating policy recommendations. It was reported,
however, to have provided a good basis for the Government's negotiating
position with regard to policy changes required for its entry into the EEC.

E1m. Project Costs
32.       At the time of appraisal, total project costs including physical
contingencies and expected price increases were estimated at Dr. 3,076.7M
(US$84M) with a foreign exchange component (direct and indirect) of US$40M or
of about 48% of total costs. The actual cost of the project amounted to
Dr. 5,589.7M (US$73.3M) with a foreign exchange component of US$40.7M or about
55.5% of total costs. The lower than estimated total project costs in US$ was
due to shortfalls in all project components but the construction of
greenhouses, while the additional cost in Drachmas was mainly due to the
higher than anticipated internal inflation during project implementation
(about 20% per year compared with about 7% per year estimated at appraisal)
coupled with about 200% devaluation of the Drachma.
TV. Agricultural hnpact
33.       As envisaged at appraisal, cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplants, peppers,
and melons are the most important greenhouse crops, with cucumbers being the
main crop produced and the only crop exported to European markets, mainly to
West Germany.  Melons are planted in the greenhouses following the cucumber
crop. The tomato variety "Early Pack" currently grown in the project area
produces large fruits which are suitable for the domestic market and export to
Middle Eastern countries but not to Europe whose consumers prefer small
tomatoes. The eggplant and pepper varieties presently grown are suitable for
the domestic market only. The melon varieties are of excellent quality and
are suitable for both domestic and export markets. Export of cucumbers in the
project area rose from 4,500 tons in 1978 to about 32,300 tons in 1984, while
production rose from 9,600 tons to 80,300 tons during the same period.
34.       The continued monocrop orientation of exports is partly due to the
still persistent weakness of the marketing organization-the large number of
traditional exporters are not strong enough to conduct market research to
introduce new export products-but mostly due to the failure to identify
appropriate varieties preferred in the European markets suitable for Greek
growing conditions. It is expected that the research now being conducted,
especially on tomato varieties, will soou provide an adequate type of tomato
acceptable in foreign markets.
V. Economic Rate of Return
35.       At the time of appraisal, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) on the
proposed investments for the Vegetable Production and Marketing project as a
whole was estimated at about 35%. No separate ERRs were calculated for
individual components because they were considered to be interdependent. The
ERR recalculated in the Government's PCR is 29% and is considered to be
satisfactory. It is mainly the result of the implementation of the greenhouse
component and, te a lesser extent, the extension and research components.
Most of the benefits of the latter two components will still reach full
development in the years to come. Because the other three components
(marketing, tractor trailers and packhouses) were either not implementeid



- IL -
(marketing organizations) or were completed to a lower level of investment
during the present year, no estimates of their impact were available at the
time of the preparaticn of the PCR. Therefore, possible incremental benefits
due to those components were not included in the Government's PCR
calculation. It is also important to note that at appraisal the "without
project" situation for the areas where greenhouses were to be replaced, was
assumed to be a return to open field cultivation and therefore per strema
benefits in the without case situation were estimated at very low levels. In
the Government's PCR, it has been assumed that without the project, the
existing greenhouses would have been replaced with construction of lower
quality greenhouse and therefore yields would be at about 70% of those
achieved under improved greenhouse. This assumption is considered to be more
realistic then the one adopted at appraisal.
VI. Institutional Performance
36.      Government.  Considerable delays were experienced in obtaining the
ratification of the Loan Agreement by the Greek Parliament, a requirement for
the project to become effective (para 10). Delays in reaching agreement
between the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce and Transport on the strategy
for developing the export market system prevented implementation of the
marketing component (para 23) and caused shortfalls in the implementation of
packhouses (para 14) and tractor-trailer (para 16) components. To improve the
financial viability of ABG, the Government in 1978 raised the agricultural
onlending rates by 0.5% and decreed increases in ABG's capital of about 400%
(para 7). During project implementation, with a view to compensating the
banking system in part for increasing internal inflation rates, the Government
decreed several increases in interest rates for the economy as a whole.
Currently, agricultural interest rates vary from 14% to 17%, however they are
still below the current annual rate of inflation 1/.
37.      Since the project started, the Ministry of Agriculture has been very
eager and active in implementing the research and extension components.
Delays occurred, however, in the preparation of tender documents for procuring
research equipment and in approving procurement decisions thereafter. As a
consequence, such equipment could not be procured under the project (para 30).
38.      Agricultural Bank of Greece.  On the whole, ABG has been very
effective implementing the project. Early in the project period, ABG
developed and introduced new formats and procedures for the appraisal of
medium and long term loans (para 9), and, in spite of delays in project
effectiveness, it was very active in implementing the project. Loans for
construction of greenhouses were close to appraisal targets since the project
started (para 11). Some delays in implementing the other two credit
components were partly due to internal bureaucratic procedures within ABG in
preparing and approving tender documents, but mostly due to the general
failure in reaching an agreement on the strategy for developing marketing
organizations, which was outside ABG's control.
39.      As agreed during negotiations, ABG's long term debt equity ratio, as
defined in the Supplemental Letter No. 3 to the Loan Agreement, 2/ was

kept at about 8:1 during all the project years prior to 1983. However, the
long-term debt equity ratio has substantially increased from about 4.5:1 in
1978 to about 9:1 during 1983, while the overall debt equity ratio 1/
increased from 7.5:1 in 1978 to 21:1 in 1983, a nearly 200Z increase due
mainly to the rapid growth in short-term debt. During the same period,
however, the return on Average Equity increased from about 1% in 1978 to about
82 in 1983 while ABG's net spread increased by 1 point, from 0.4% in 1978 to
1.4% in 1983.
40.      Performance of the Consultants.  The foreign consultants, appointed
to assist the Ministry of Agricultural in designing the extension training
system, introduced a number of recommendations which were readily implemented
to improve the production of fruits and vegetables (para 26). The consultants
employed to assist the Ministry of Agriculture in reviewing the researcl
programs have been most useful in providing reorientation of research
emphasis, developing a quite successful fruit and vegetable adaptive research
plan, and providing training to local counterparts (para 29). The consultant
engaged to assist ABG in preparing the detailed features of the regional
marketing companies prepared a proposal which was well received by the
Government (para 24). It lacked, however, the statutory details for the
establishment of the companies, and it was not considered appropriate by the
Bank since it excluded the already well-developed private exporters and
required compulsory marketing of produce through the regional marketing
organizations.
41.      Performance of the Bank.  During project preparation, the Benk
assisted the Government in preparing the terms of reference for the
feasibility study and agreed to finance the cost of such study from the
proceeds of Loan 1165-GR (para 5). During project preparation and appraisal,
the Bank recommended increases in agricultural onlending rates and of ABG's
capital to improve ABG's financial viability (para 7) and assisted the
Government in the preparation of the technical framework for the study of
interest rates and agricultural subsidies (para 31). It, however,
underestimated the time and resources required for reaching agreement with the
Government in the operational features for the establishment of the marketing
organizations. Moreover, lack of field supervision for this project for over
a year from October 1980 to February 1982 hbas probably exacerbated the lack of
understanding between the Government and the Bank with regard to the
establishment of the marketing organizations.

Concusions and Lesons Learned
42.      In general and in spite of moderate implementation delays and
shortfalls in implementing three of the six project components, the project is
considered to have achieved most of its major objectives.  During the project
period-1978-1984-the production of cucumbers, the main product grown under
greenhouses in the project area, increased by eight times while the quantities
exported increased by about five times.  On the other hand, the nu   *nefit
per strema, before interest and depreciation, increased by about five times.
The fact that the improvements to the marketing system were not fully
implemented does not appear to have successfully prevented the overall
performance of the project as the already existing marketing channels were
used to promote project induced production in internal and external markets.
Shortfalls in the implementation of the marketing components might, however,
have prevented Greece from taking great advantage of the export markets. The
improvements to the extension and research programs have already significantly
contributed to the development of applied research, to the dissemination of
modern and intensive cultivation techniques to farmers, and to increase the
productivity of greenhouse cultivation, not only in the project area but also
outside it.
43.      Close and intensive collaboration between the Government, the
consultants and the Bank from the initial stages of the project cycle resulted
in a smooth completion of project appraisal and Loan negotiations with
significant improvements to the institutional and operational aspects of ABG's
work. It also facilitated the successful implementation of three of the six
project components without major delays.
44.      Lack of clear and detailed organizational agreement for the
implementation of regional marketing companies during project appraisal,
coupled. with substantial delays in project effectiveness (which prevented
hiring of the marketing consultant) and followed by an absence of Bank field
supervision missions for about 16 months during a critical stage of project
implementation, were the main reasons for the inability to reach agreement on
the strategy to be followed to successfully implement the marketing component.
45.      Although ABG's long-term debt equity ratio has deteriorated during
the project period, from 4.5:1 in 1978 to 9:1 in 1983, its return to average
equity increased from about 1% to about 82 and its net spread (before
provision for bad debts) from 0.41 to 1.41 during the same period.

Tie  agricultural sector in Greece reains ; basic branch of the eoonarty
sharing about 17% of MP in 1983 frm  about 23% in 1965. It accouts for 31%
of total exports and empaloys 27% of the active population.
Fruts and vegetables accmt f&  about 41% of agricultural exports
yieldirg nearly aS $ 467 million of foreign exchange in 1983. Mst of the
fruits and nearly all of the vegetable exports are marketed in the EEC.
Annual gross fixed investnt ireased fran  US $ 204 million  Ln 1970 tO
US $ 565 million in 1983 which accouted -for about 8% of total gross fixed
investent in the ecnay during the same year.
The nain characteristics of Greek agriculture are its small and fragmented
land holdings, the smal1 percentage of irrigated land, (only 25% of the culti-
vable land), the inefficient organization of the marketing system and the
i ate research and extension services. As a result the azrerage farmn
inome is low ccapared to the national average incxie and mnany fanners try to
increase their earnings with part time eplont or by intnsive cultivation
(such as through investments in green houses) of high value crops (such as
out of season vegetables).
In order to face these problens the Gverrment eiphasizes in the National
Development Plan and Investnent Progrmu for the agricultural sector the expan-
sion of irrigated area, the consolidation of fragmented land holdings, the
improvement of marketing organization and facilities and the expansion of
intensive cultivations. Therefore the specific project for vegetable produdtion
and marketing held a high priority for implementation. The project included
the oonstrn=tion of greenhouses, the improvement of existang research
and extension services, the orcanization of marketing com-
panies, the construction of packhouses and cold storages for veaetables and
supply refrigerated tractor trailers for transport of project commodities.
The total cost of the project was estimated US $ 84 million (Dr. 3075,7
million) and the sources of finarce were the Wrld Bank (US $ 30 million), the
Agricultural Bank of Greece (US $ 33,9 million) ,the beneficiaries (US $
18,3 million) and the Covement (US $ 1,8 million).
The inmplrenting agency for the major part of the project and credit
channel for most of the investments is the Agricultural Bank of Greece. The



-2-
Ministry of Agriculture also has undertaken the ixrplemntation of the part
of the project which deals with research and extension services.
The Agricultural Bank of Greece was established in 1929 as an independent
banking institution and belongs to the category of Public Banks. The main
activities of ABG are: the provision of credit to     farners through short
term and long term loans, the financing and support of     farmers' coopera-
tive organizations and the setting up and operation of modern units for the
packaging, standardisation and processing of all kinds of farm products.
EVxthenmore the Bank undertakes on behalf of the state all of the financial
with
dealings connected the inplemrentation of the Common Agricultural Policy. The
Bank also makes special efforts for a more rational organization of production
and for improving the efficiency of Agricultural production units. In addition
it accepts time and saving deposits and owns the majority of the stock of an
Agricultural Insurance Ccupany.
The ABG employs about 6.700 employees and nearly half of its personnel
are well e.xnerienced universitv graduates.          Its central office is
located in Athens but the net work of 187 branches and 159 offices for collec-
tion of deposits is wide spread all over the country.
The ABG is directed by the Governor and his Deputy,but suprema admini-
strative authority is vested on the Board of Directors consisting of 13
members.

II. PRDEJr mENrFIQCN, PRPEARATINC AND APPRAISAL
The Ministry of Agriclture identified the need for a develcoent
project for the production andmsrketing of horticultural products, mainly
because of the importance of the above subsector for the agricultural
sector of the Greek econauy and the prospect of the entry of the cunntry
into the Europen Ecnomic Ccmmity and the consequent need for the adjust-
mst of horticultral production and rarketing to the standards of the
EEC.
under these circumstances the tMJnistry of Agricu-It.re and the Agricul-
tural Bank of Greece entrusted the study of the production and marketing
of the horticultural products and the preparation of a developmnnt project
to the Stevenson and Kellogg consultant ccmpany. In this study the main
prcblems of the sector, such as the small and fragmented land holdings, the
low labour productivity, the limited income  of the producers, the ineffi-
ciencies of the marketing channel and the poor research and extension servi-
ces were concretely identified. One of the basic findings of the study on
which the developrent project was based was the good prospects for the
increase of the production of the out-of-season vegetables in the areas of
Crete and Peloponnesus due to the favourable weather conditions which prevail
in these areas. During the preparation of the study and the developrent
project, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agricultural Bank of Greece.
provided the proper assistance to the consulting team of Stevenson and
Kellogg in order to carry cut its task effectively.
Ihe preparation of the project by the consultant's company followed
smoothly the original identification of it by the Ministry of Agriculture
and there were no major delays between these successive procedLres. Further-
more, we could say that the scope of the project was clear from the beginning
and there was no need for any revision dLurin the preparation procedure.
The project  included     adequate information about the producticn
conditions, the situation in the marketing channels and inresearch and
extension services in the specific areas of Crete and Peloponnesus and for
the subsector of out of seascn vegetables.
During the preparation of th.e project the executing acencies w-ere
fullv informed f or any conditions and rec-uirements concemnnia it. The projec-
included      provisions and was an oppzor-itv  for the inrro-rement of +-e

project appraisal procedures used by the Agricultural Bank of Greece, contribut-
ing in this wy to the trainina of its perscnel.
The appraisal of the project was carried out in October/November 1977
by a team consist  of World Bankofficials and other cnsultants. The cmUted
financial and econanic rates of return showed that the impleTlentation of the
project would benefit the varicus participating entities. In general the
idendification, preparation and appraisal procedures were properly cacupleted
without any special problem and the collaboration among the participating
entities, was smooth and effective.
The project was in the Governnmt's priority list of devel opnt programs.
in the agricultural sector because of the importance of out of season vegetables
subsector in the agricultural economy. The contributicn of the project to the
regional development of Crete and Peloponnesus is quite significant since,
according to ABG data for the year 1982,the production under greenhouses
reprew-snts 10% of the total crop production in Crete and 5% of the total
crop production in Peloponnesus. Especially in the regions of Heraclion (Crete)
the producticn under greenhouses represents 14% of the total crop production of
the region and in Chania 5% of the total crop production. As far as Pelopcnnesus
is concerned the sane percentage for Calamata, Pirgos and Sparti is 7%, 4% and
3r respectively.
The importance of the project for the area is even greater because of the
introduction of new methods of cultivation which would increase productivity
in the areas of the project and consequently farners inccoie.
The project would consist of the following complementary cc nents:
-construction of greenhouses on about 9.000 stremma to permit the producticn of
out of season vegetables,-provision of equipment,-training and consultant
services and facilities to i=rove existing research and extensicn services,
-consultant services and facilities to help organize marketing ca panies mainly
to prarote exports,-construction and irmprovement of packhouses and cold storages
for vegetables, and-supply of refrigerated tractor trailers for transport of
project commodities.
Greenhouses
The greenhouses cam=onent would involve replacement of small, old and
inefficient plastic houses with i=proved standard areerMouses on about 7, OOO
stremma and the erection  of new oreenhouses on about  2,000  stren.m
which were under open cultivation. About 75% of the total area would be



located in Crete and the renaining 25% in Peloponnesus. The greenhouses
wsld be designed to meet the specific weather and producticn conditions
of Crete and Pelopnnesus.
Pesearch and Extension
Egaipnent and supplies wuld be provided to selected research centers
and institutes and to extension services operating in the project areas.
The research equipment "Clpennit in-depth investigations in identified
areas         such as vegetable varieties,heat ventilation greenhouse struc-
tures and coverings. The extension service would be provid6d with basic
materials and supplies to conduct an effective program. Most of the research
ewiiEment would be for centers and institutes in Crete and Peloponnesus,but
others,ukhich are located outside   these regions but their research programs
benefit project needs wcld also be eligible recipients.
Apprcocimately 50 nn years of training abroad waRld be provided for 8
research and 30-40 extension personnel.
lwo research and two extension consultants, one each for Crete and Pelo-
pcnnesus,wculd be provided. Each consultant would have at least one counter-
part in additiont%ther local research and extension persanne' wculd be eployed
to assist in conducting programs to be developed by the consultants. Each of
the research and extension consultants wold serve for about four and
three years respectively but the duration of their services is subject to
review depending on project needs.
Marketing Organization
Abcut four marketing copanies wculd be established in Crete and Pelo-
ponnesus. These companies would be involved in the marketing of primarily
horticultural prodacts in both domestic and export markets. The project wculd
provide office buildings and equipment and about 4 man-years of foreian
consultant services to help in establishina and organizing the companies and
in operating them initially. It would also provide funds to cover salaries o-



-6-
local coterxpart and support staff and recurrent expenditures during the
initial three years of operation.
Packhouses and Cold Storages .
Six new packhasses with appropriate cooling facilities w.ld be con-
stxted and at least as vapy existing packhuss wmld be imroved. They
uld be sLitable for nultiproduct use and each of them  wwxd have a capa-
city of 40 tons per day except one which wzuld have a capacity of only 25
tons. Typical improvecents of existing packhouses woud involve replacement
of packing lines and addition of cold stores.
Refrigerated tractor-trailers
The project would provide 50 refrigerated tractor-trailers each with a
standard capacity of 20 tons and adapted to carry standard Europallets.
Cost Estirates
The total cost of the project including physical contingencies and expec-
ted price increases is estinated at Dr. 3.076,7 million (US $ 84 million)
with a foreign exchange cmxponent (direct and indirect) of US $ 40 million
or 48% of total cost. The cost estinate is based cn June 1978 prices and
includes taxes and duties computed at Dr. 430 million (US $ 11.7 million).
Physical ccntingencies have been camputed at 10% on all items except for
equiPrent and consultant services ihere no such contingencies were provided.
Price cuntingencies on all civil works have been computed at annual ccax=ond
rates of 9% during 1978-79 and 8% thereafter, continqencies on equipment
have been estinated at annual conpound rates of 7.5% during 1978-1979 and 7%
thereafter. These are based on the World Bank's "Guidelines on expected Price
Increases. Jan. 31 1977".
Financing
Ihe proposed Bank loan of US $ 30 million wculd f iance abcut36% of the
total cost of the project (75% of the foreign exchange caoponent) or about
42% of total cost net of taxes and duties. Of the remaining project cost of US
$ 54 millions, ABG wculd finance US $ 33.9 million (40%),beneficiaries US c
18.3 million (22%) and Goveimnent US $ 1.8 million (2%).



-7-
The Agriltual Bank of Greece and the Ministxy of Aqriculture believe
that the inplentation of the project wud  lead to increase of the iWare of
thebeneficiaries and this fact ccld provide a basis for the futare ecpansicr
of the project.

III. IMLMNTAC
The project was expected to be inplented during the 1978-82  period
and procurwent to start towacs the end of 1978 and continue until mid
1982.
me loan agreenent of the project was signed on July 10, 1978. After
this date according to the provisions of the loan agreent investints
were eligible for finance from the loan.
However the disbursents had a late start because the declaraticn of
the effectiveness of the loin was done an Yay 12, 1980 after the ratificaticn
of the loan aggreenut by the Creek Parlianent, %bich took place con Jauary 26,
1980.
As a consequence, the disbursemets which started after this date, yielded
wsaller amomts in U.S. Dollars because the exchange rate between the US
Dollar and the Drachma had chanced in the meantime.
The revisions made after the construction of the project had started
involved the following:
- Consideration of private truck owners as beneficiaries of tractor
trailer credit,provided that their main activities included the export of
fresh horticultural produce.
- In the case of EuroXKreta, a broad based ccpany of Crete,an exeeption
was made to the number of tructor trailers to be approved for financing
under the project. So 19 tructor trailers were approved for this ccapany but
unfortunately it's still awaiting    the operating licence from the Ministry
of Transportation.
- Reallocation of loan amounts and amendirent of the total areaL of green-
houses were permittedsothat existing greenhouses to De replaced on about
7.400 str. instead of 7.000 str. reallocating the loan amount from 18.200.000
US Dollars to 14.700.000 US dollars and the additional greenhouses to be
placed on 3.600 str. instead of 2.000 str. of open cultivated land realloca-
ting the loan amount fran 5.200.000 US dollars to 8.700.000 US dollars.
Thus the total area of greenhouses under the project was increased frar.
9.000 str. to 11.000 str.
- For the narketing organization camTonent of the project, revisions
were made twice for the dates of hirina marketinc consultants and for sub-
ritting the orcanizational and unmlem-r.-ator- rlars for the marketing



-9-
cuanies the establishment of which was dissapointIng. (Ckly two murketing
coftpanies were established which haven't operated yet).
- The procedure for the realization of civil works for the construction
of new padckuses was revised. According to this revision the procuremnt
by international bidding was abandoned and the civil works of the new paac-
uses could be ndetaken by local coatructors through public bidding.
- The study on Agricultural interest rates and subsidies was ccipleted
and its findings were very useful.
- The closing date of the project was agreed to be the 30th of June 1984
instead of the 30th of June 1982.
in
ABG the executing agency issued periodic progress reports which were
useful to other supervisory agencies as the Ruiistries of Agriculture and
National Fconary and also to the World Bank.
Prcrnient
The problems which occured concern the procarezmt for the construction
of the packinghouses and cold stores by Internaticnal Capetitive Bidding.
These were due to the fact that the normal procedure for constructing buildings
to be used by cooperative organizmans is through public bids where bidders
alnrost always are local constructors and the cooperatives didn't agree to
change this procedure.
After the revision of this point the usual way for the civil work was
followed and only the quipment were pr-oced through InternatLonal Bidding.
The obvious benefits were not only the achievenent of better prices for the
construction of packhouses but also a contribution to the econay of the area
because locally produced materials and labor force were used.
It rmust be noted that scai delay to this part of the project is due
also to cooperatives elections which postponed decision making.

fnplementatian Schedule
Part Al. Ccnstruction of greenhouses
The actual constructions were above the oriainal estimations as far as the new
ozeenhouses are concerned. The actual replacements have covered 100,7% of the
original estimatiorns and 95,3% of the last cnes (after aendErent) The analyyti-
Cal data ccmcerning the constructions is sIown below.

The new greenhouses, which were constructed by the end of 1982, axe above
the original esti$mtions, since 2.314 str. had been constructed instead of 2.000
str. that were estimated originally. Also by the end of Noverber 1984, 3.700
str. had been constructed instead of 3.600 str. that were estimtaed after the
anendmrent of the area was nade.
As far as the replacement of the existing greenhouses is concerned the area
actually used until the end of November 1984 is 7.050 str. instead of 7.400 str. -
which were the revised estimates.
The loans sioned durinq the vears 1978-1984 are shown in tables 2a, 2b and
amounted 4.215 nillicn Drs while the cost of the construction was 5.269 million
Drs. The total area of greenhouses which corresponds to the above figures Of
signed loans is 11.335 stremTas.
The implementation of the qreenhouses component of the project could be
considered very good coniared to that of the other coapcnents of it. The total
area constructed is 10.750 str. which is 119,4% of that originally estimated
and 97,8%0 of the last projection. Also the greenhouses established were better
constructions than those existed before because new technical specifications were
introdulced. This perrnitted new cultivation techniques to be developed which
improved the qualitv and increased the yields of the products.

On the other hand, the illplenentation of the cther parts of the project
influeneed to scae ectent the ecorts of the products of qreexnhouses .a:d
caisequetly their,prices,affectinq      nmstly the replacerent of thle exi-
sting greenhouses.



-12-
Part A2. Packhouses and Cold Storages
The original impleuntation schedule of this part of the project incltued
the construction of six new packbouses with appropriate cooling facilities
and the inpruvemt of   many existing packhouses. T1  packhouses would have
been suitable for mnultiproduct uss and each of them would have a capacity
of 40 tons per day except one which would have a capacity of only 25 tons.
The inproveirent of existinghuses would involve replaceent of packing lines
and addition of cold stores.
The actual inplementation involves the improvennt of five existing
packIoses in Mires, Paleochora Selinon, Timbaki, Filiatra and Vori-Fan-}i
and the construction of two new ones in Finikous and Skala (Table 3).
The imprcvements which were made in the existing packhouses concerned
the replacement or addition of packing lines and in the new cnes the construc-
tion of buildings and the procurement of the necessary marhinery.
All the above packhouses have been completed except that of Lakoniki in
Skala, which is still in progress.
The capacity of each of the above packhouses exceeds 20 tons per day
for the cacumbers and scme of them are for multiproduct use (Details are
shcwn in table 3).
The total amount of loans signed for this part of the project is 126,2
million Drs. which also represents their total cost.
P A3. Tractor trailers
In this part of the project provision was made of about fifty refrige-
rated tractor-trailers each with a standard capacity of about 20 tons.
Beneficiaries of subloans under this part of the project had to be
experienced trucking   arues the  mair activities of Which incl.uRe expor4
of fresh horticultural produce. mhe total nu-ter of tractor trailers to be
financed for a single beneficiary couldn't exceed five.
However exemption was made for Eurokreta,a broad based ccmpany of Crete,
and a loan was approved for the procurement of 19 tractor trailers but unzfo-rt-
nateiv this caorany didn't aet tne licence to operate as a trucking conp2r.



- 13 -
Also an other eption was rade and private truck owners were omsidered
as   ficiaries for credit because the tracking  mpanies, despite the efforts
made, didn't show intewstto be financed. After this revision, the loans which
were signed by private owners amted to 77.705 thousand drs and concened
the purchase of 7 refrigerated tractor trailers, 4 tractors and 12, refrigera-
ted trailers the  total cost of which was 129.174 toand drs.
The factors which affected the hplnta   of this part of the project, wre
the high ontribution of the beneficiaries and the high prices of the new refri-
gerated tracto  trailers.
Part B. Marketing Organization
The original ifrplentation schedule of this part of the project concered
the establishilnt of four capanleS in Cete and Pe1oponnesus for the -arketing
priarily of horticultural products to darestic and export markets, including
inter alia about four man-years of foreign consultants' services for this par-
pose. The appointment of the consultants should have taken place not later
than Deceber 31, 1978 and the suhsion of inplemintation plans for the marke-
ting cazpanies not later than June 30,1979.
Actually the first regional marketing oanpany under the project was EPSIPAM
in Messinia Pelcpornesus which was already in existence but has broadened its
soope in 1980 so as to include the -arketing of agriul      products in  its
activities. The new brand of the canpany was AGREK and its shareolders were
Agrex 51% and the Central Union of Cooperatives Unions of Messinia 49%.
The secnd regional marketing caq3any under the project was IAKMaE S.A.-
which was established in 1981 and is located in Scala-Lakonia-Pelo}ia-sus.
The shareholders of the campanv are the Union of Agricultural Cooperatives
of Lakonia 55%, the Agricultural Cooperative of Glycavrissi 3%, the Agricultural
Cooperative of Apidea 0,5% and the Agricultural Bank of Greece 41,5%.
For LKONIKT S.A. a loan of 33 Lillion Drs has been also approved for
the constrwuon of a packing house and the procuraent of the necessary machniery.
No other marketing carpany was established and those established didn't
operate because there was a chance in the policy concerng the marketing of
the fam oducts.This policy is based on the establishment of Assetbly Markets
in the production centers.
As far as the euployment of marketing consultants is concerned only one
Mr. Hatjisotiriou - was hlred  through the Cypriot Consulting Firm N.V.
Marketing Ltd (Mr. Vasiliou) &nd started-his duties on the first of November
1981.



-14-
Mr. Hatjisotiriou us expected to activate the regional marketin  cama-
nies of the Peloponnesus area (AG4, rAKaI().
qhe Consulting Firm's proposls were submitted during the first quarter
of 1982 but the World Bank didn't consider them reasonable.
Part C. Researh and Extension Programs
a. Research
- 1W Research Consultants, one for Crete and the other for Peloponncsus
were prwided. Dr. H. Passam plant physiologist has been working in the
Vegetable Institute of Kalazmta since Mrch 1981 and Professors R. Carolus
and A. Bry uorked on a part tire basis in the region of Crete during 1980
and 1981.
*ne above consultants helped the local research centres to plan and
carry out various projects concerninq:
- the testing of new vegetable varieties with special reference to fruit
quality and productivity under unheated conditions.
- new cultivation techniques including the use of vibration for fruit-
setting of tomatoes, new methods of crop spacing, supDort and pruning, the
use of grafting for disease control of certain crops, the use of mulching
and of alternative planting substrates and propagation ccposts.
- rpVrovenmit of methods of irrigation and fertilization with the
assistance of leaf and substrate analyses.
- iuprovement of disease and pest control methods includinq the use of
biological control techniques and solar sterilization of the soil.
- determination of actual production costs and potential maarket returns
for the principal greenhouse vegetable crops and investiaaticn of ays to
reduce oosts.
- the solutien     of some special local problems caused b" uater and
soil salinitv, or the excessive use of fertilizers and other agrochemicals.
Mhe main results of these projects were Dresented at special reetinas
to the research, extension and other relevant personnel at Heraclion, durino
April 1980, April 1982, and N ay 1984. tich meetinms will be repeated  ever"
tw vears.

- The training of research personmel concerned I1 trainees, 8 of whan
were sent abroad under the original orcqmren and an additional 3 who departed
this year under a supplerentarv agreenent with the Barnk and are still cCn-
tinuing their studies.
bhe nujority of trainees have conleted their training and are now
reestablishe.. in their research posts. Additionally 3 trainees, with the
agreeznt of the Bank, cconverted their studies to the level of Ph.D. degree
instead of the level of M.Sc. as originally provided in the loan.
Totally the above trainig prorane has comprised 20 nan-years abroad
until now.
above
Ebr of the trainees are for Pelownnesus and the rennining 7 for
Crete. A list of these trainees, by subject country and University can be
provided if necessary.
The equipent and supplies provided for the research centres Included:
- the constnzction of new greenhouses for experimental ourposes, the
provision of heatina systems, apparatus to monitor the greenhouse enviratwent,
apparatus for soil sterilization.
- tWo fourwheel transport vehicles
- some items of equipirent for chemical residue testing, and for soil and
leaf analysis.
The reraining equipient for the laboratories is in the process of procure-
ment but, owing to delays in purchasing procedure, will not be supplied before
the end of 1984.
b. Extension
Two extension consultants were provided, W. Eric Le Tissier and J.G.
Gillow,who worked for 25 mmn months in total-during 1WO,-1-081 and 1982.
The above consultants heloed the extension services in the two regions
with:
- the orcranization of two trainina centres, one in Crete and the other in
Peloponnesus,u*hich included. four cTreenhouses. The centres, Which are sti22. in
orTe7lazo.  are used for the denonstration o' iimroved cultiva-lion practices
to extensiocr officers and farvers.



-16-
- the trainina of extension officers in all asoects of greenhouse operaticn
and cultivation.
- the train ina of farnvers to izprove cultivation methods, crop production
and quality.
- ozganizaticn of seminars an special topics of greenhouse operation for
both extension officers and farmrs - the semiars being held both at the
denmstration centres and in the areas of production.
- the provision of infornatian leaflets for training purowses.
Followina the departure of the extension consultants, the training of
farmers and other extension officers uas undertaken by the previously trained
agroncmists with the collaboratim of the research corsultant, Dr. Passam, .to
has continued to work in Pelopennesus.
Of the 33 nan-years overseas training for extension staff provided for
in the programme, approxiLatelv 18 men-vears have been taken up. Thtally, 17
agronomists have been placed in foreicn institutions. Of these, 8 have returned
and now work in the areas of the progran!. The renaina 9 will return during
1985. Additionally two familiarization visits were arranced for extension
officers to visit modern greenhouses, institutions and markets in various
u.roean states. Each visit ciorrised 20 days and in total 27 agronomists
took part.
Failure to utilize all the training period provided for in the programne
was due to language difficulties on the part of some agronomists and also to
difficulties in securing places at foreign universities.
Of the various itens of equipnt for the extension service provided
for in the progranme, the most essential have been purchased and are in use.



-17-
Costs
The total cost of the project including physil cCntingencies 'and expected
price increases was estimated at Ds. 3.076,7 millicn (US $ 84 million) with a
foreign exchange coqnent (direct and 4 idirect) of US $ 40 million or 48% of
total cost. mhe cost estinte was based on June 1978 prices and includes taxes
and duties caiuted at Dr. 430 million (US $ 11.7 millicn).
The actual cost of the project amted US $ 73.28 million with a foreign
exchange cononent of US $ 4).73 million or 56% of the total cost (Table 7).
Canp.rison between actual and estirated cost for the various cocrpments
of the project shows the following:
- The actual cost for the construction of greenhouses is US $ 70.5 million
which is 41% more than that estimated while  the area of the greenhouses
constructed is 19.4% more than the original projection.                   
- Ihe actual cost for the oackhouses and cold stores is US $ 0.90. millicn
which is only 22 % of that estimted but onlv two new packhouses were con-
structed instead of six and five existing were improved.
The      high costs of greenhouses and packhouses are due to the high
inflation rates.
- The actual cost for the refrigerated tractor trailers is US $ 1.01 million
which is only 1i-A of that estimated and this is due to the fact that onlv
7 refrigerated tractor trailers, 4 tractors and 12 refrigerated trailers
were purchased instead of 50 refrigerated tractor trailers that were esti-
mated.             -
- The actual cost for marketing organization concerns only the cost of the
marketing consultant which is US S 59.300. The cost is lower than the
estimated because onlv one marketing consultant was hired for sixteen
mnnths instead of four man-vears consultina services.

IV. FIZNCIAL PERFOMCE
Ihe financial rate of returu for the qreenhouses corvoent of the project
vas estinated higher than 31% which is considered satisfactory ccapared to the
figures uhich had been calculated, an tvnical investret rcdels and which ranged
betem 22% and 40% according to the product concerned.
The conxtations were based ai year 1983 prices of inputs and outputs
and an the following assumpticns:
- There is one year tixn lag betwen costs and benefits and the durability
of the greenhouses is ten years.
- For yields, prices, costs etc. actual data for the different crows in the
project areas were used until 1984. For the next years the 1984 fiqures were
used.
= Without project, the area of the new established greenhouses would have been
i for open-field cultivation while the existing greenhouses would have been
replaced with constructions of lower quality and'as a result with
lower yields (About 70% of the new ones with the project).
This assumption is considered mocre realistic and is different from that
made at the appraisal stage of the project where it was assuned that the
entire area would be used for open field cultivation.
- Residual value is estimated 10% of the cost of investments.
- Details about the figures obtained after the above calculations are
sh,cwn in table 8

V. EOt09C  REEvALUATICN 
fhe economic rate of return for the greenhouses conaent of the project
is estinated higher than 29% which is ccnsidered satisfactory. The econanic
rate of return estimted at the &ppraisal stacne was 35* but.  concerned all
the caompents of the project and so it  cannot             be ccxzpared
with the figure estimated here.
the mamn assulpticns 1-e&addition to those for the estimation of the
financial rate of returX are the following:
- The shadow price of US Doll=r   -    is estimated 10% higher than
its official exchange rate. Thus whenever      . a foreign exchange ccnv=ent
is involved there is a 10% increase of the relevant value.
- All the components of the project which are imported are free of duties
and taxes.
- Prices of inputs and eswecially those of fertilizern%z'e subsidized
prices.
- Labor is valued at the sare rate.
- Details about the figures obtained after the above calculations are
shown in table '3

VI. CiNCLUSICNS
The cbjectives of the project were to (a) increase foreign exchange
eamings (and savings) and prc0te ecncanic growth by expanding production
of cut-of-season vegetables in tlb high potential regions; (b) help raise
labor- productivity on small farms by promting intensive cultivaticn; (c)
strengthenexisting research and extensin institutions so as to prcste
production of high value crops; (d) strengthen the Agriltr  Bank of
Greece by enabling it to =Prove its lending operations and recourse mobi-
lization efforts.
On the wihole   we consider that the project succeded its objectives.
7he production of cucumbers itLich was the main product in the areas of the
project    increased by 8,4 tines fran 1978/1979 to 1983/84. In the same
period the quantity of exports of cucmbers produwed in the areas of the
project    increased by 4,9 times. On the other hand the net benefit per stren-
na . before interest and depreciation    increased by 4,9 times. During
the implementation of the project, fran 1977 to 1984, the Agricultural Bank
of Greece and its branches in the areas of the project received considered
and approved 7.554 applications for loans for the installation of new green-
houses and for the replacenent of the existing ones.
We consider that although the part of the project concernincr the market-
ing facilities was not fully implemented, this fact did not have an adverse effer
cPhe overall perfornance of the project because the already existing marketing
chanels were used efficiently for the promotion of the products to the final
consuuer.
The inprovement of the infrastructure in research and extension faci-
lities in the areas of the project contributed sionificantly to the applica-
tion and use of mnodern intensive techniques by the fanzers and to the increase
ofpreoductivity of cultivation under greenhouses.
