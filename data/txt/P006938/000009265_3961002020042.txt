BASJC IEDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL. REPORT
Loan and Project Summary
forrower:                   Republic of Costa Rica
Beneficiary:                Ministry of Public Education
ExecutiU2 Airenm:           Ministry of Public Education
Loan Amount:                US$23.0 million
lerms:                      Repayment in 17 years including 5 years of grace at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:         The project would support the Government's education sector strategy
and priority programs, as outlined in the Government's National
Development Plan, 1990-94, and Its General Plan for Education 1990-
94. It would specifically: (1) improve the quality and efficiency of
basic educaticn (grades 1-9), in particular in disadvantaged rural and
marginal urban areas, by providing the necessary educational inputs
and support services to raise the level of student achievement and
reduce the incidence of repetition and drop out; (2) strengthen the
Ministry of Education's management and planning capacitv in order to
efticiently and equitably administer a decentralized education system;
and (3) support improvements in secondary education by carrying out
an in-depth study of the subsector, and a pilot program in computer-
assisted education.
Proiect Description:        The Project comprises three main components.
(1) Improvements of the Ouality of Basic Education (83 percent of
total project costs including contingencies) would include: (a)
curriculum revision; (b) the production and distribution of student
textbooks, workbooks, teaching manuals aaid educational materials,
including school libraries; (c) an institutionalized in-service training
program for teachers and administrators; and (d) improvements in
physical infrastructure and facilities in the country's most
disadvantaged rural and marginal urban regions, including schools
damaged by the earthquake of April 22, 1991.
(2) Stren2thening of Sector PiLnning and Management (14 percent of
total project costs) would strer.gthen the planning and administrative
capacity of MEP, specifically in the areas of personnel management,
financial and budgetary control, and educational planning, at the
central level and, in support of the Government's decentralization
policies, at regional levels by: (a) the provision of computers, related
equipment, and staff development programs; (b) the installation of an



- iv -
effective management information systerm for the collection and
processing of educational data; and (c) the development of an
institutionalized student achievement testing and evaluation service.
(3) Improvement in the Ouality of Secondary Education (3 percent of
total project costs) would include: (a) an in-depth study of the present
status and needs of secondary education; and (b) a two-phase pilot
program of computer-assisted education in a total of 20 secondary
ac,ademic schools, with the provision of micro-computers, curriculum
revision and teacher/administrator training.
Projec b_enefits:           The project would improve the quality and efficiency of basic
education through an effective decentralized education service.
Relevant and high quality basic education would help provide trained
and trainable manpower for the economy, especially for the non-
traditional export activities. Improved student flows and higher levels
of achievement would enhance efficiency in the use of public sector
resources. The special emphasis given to the increase in educational
expenditures for basic education would also help redress the
imbalances in the allocation of public sector resources between
different levels of education, directing more resources to higher-
yielding lower education levels. Improved student retention and
completion rates, and higher levels of student achievement would in
general benefit all students. However, the main focus would be on
the most disadvantaged rural and marginal urban populations. Family
lif ' and the role of women in the home and at work would receive
special attention in curriculum development and textbooks. Half the
beneficiary children of the project would be girls; therefore, the
project can be expected to have positive effects on the fertility levels,
health status, and educational attainment of future generations.
Project Risks               Principal project risks relate to: (a) the timely avalability of
counterpart funds; and (b) the implementation capacity of the
Govermment, in particular as affected by the pace of the proposed
decentralization program. With regard to (a), IDB's and IBRD's
financing of a high percentage (together, 83%) of project costs
reduces the need for counterpart funding, thus easing the
government's fiscal burden. Establishment of the project account
would mitigate the risk in counterpart fund provision. Moreover, the
strong support for the project already evinced by the Government
should ensure high priority for funding of the project and of the
recurrent expenditures engendered by it. In regard to (b), the
Government's strategy to freeze a number of non-essential central
administrative positions and apply these vacancies to key appointmnents
in the regions, together with existing legislation permitting the
redistribution of staff within regions and a policy of staff incentives,
should resolve this issue.

BASIC EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1        By 1980 Costa Rica had reached an advanced level of social development. Indicators
such as literacy rates, infant mortality, life expectancy and the provision of health services ranked the
country in a position of en-inence among Latin American nations. Decades of continuous progress,
culminating in the accelerated pace of economic growth in the period 1969-1979, brought about a
substantial reduction in the index of poverty. During this decade GDP grew at an average annual rate
of 6.5 percent. This economic growth coupled with public sector spending in the social sectors
(education, health, nutrition) made possible a significant decline in infant mortality rates which fell
from 90 per thousand in 1950 to 19 per thousand in 1980; an extension of life expectancy to 73 years
by 1980; and a lowering of the illiteracy rate for the population aged 15 and over from 11.6 percent
in 1973 to 7.4 percent in 1984. Complementary public investments in physical infrastructure (roads,
water, electrification) and in human capital broadened employment Gpportunities for all strata of the
population, which in turn increased productivity.
1.2        But in common with most Latin American countries, the decade of the 1980s witnessed
the onset of a profound and lasting economic crisis, characterized by a sharp recession, negative
growth rates in the economy, and high inflation. As the crisis deepened, both the level and pattern of
education expenditures changed; spending decreased 25 percent in real terms between 1980 and 1988,
and education's share of the total public spending declined from 14.9 to 12.9 percent (see Annex 10,
page 1). Within the sector, higher education expenditures increased while basic education spending as
a percent of total education spending decreased. from 63 percent in 1980 to 51 percent in 1988 (see
para. 2.31). These cuts, combined with increases in primary enrollment, meant that per student
expenditures fell in real terms by over 32 percent between 1980 and 1988. Meanwhile, investment
spending declined from 27 percent of total education expenditures in 1980 to just 2 percent in 1988
(see para. 2-30). Despite a limited improvement in recent years, the subsector has never regained in
real terms its 1980 level and distribution of funding.
1.3       Inadequate and distorted resource allocation, exacerbated by weak planning and
administration, and ever increasing demand for basic education have led to a worrisome decline in
basic education quality and efficiency. Pass rates on National Achievement Tests in 1987 were
dismally low (below 30 percent), and enrollments have fallen in the upper grade levels (grades 7-9).
Equally alarming, repetition rates increased at all grade levels between 1985 and 1989, and while
dropout rates improved slightly in the first six grades during this period, they deteriorated in grades
7-9 (see Table 2.1). In ter.ns of inputs, the qualificationt of the teaching force and supplies of
textbooks have deteriorated. Student flow rates and test scores are particularly low among poorer
groups living in rural areas, where the proportion of unqualified teachers working in single-teacher
schools is high (see Annex 7, page 1).
1.4        The decline in educational quality and efficiency presents a major challenge to the
Government. The severe reduction in resources for basic education greatly reduced the Ministry of
Public Education's (MEP) ability to provide many of the input elements of sound education - a trained
teaching staff, educational equipment and materials, adequate infrastructure, teacher support services,
especially appropriate curricula and continmious assessments of student performance, and teaching

methodologies adapted to the changing needs of the economy. To meet this challenge, the
Government's General Plan for Education (PlanG enera-I  Educacion. 1990-1994) accords high
priority to the education sector, and sets out objectives and strategies designed to restore the quality,
relevance and efficiency of public education, as part of an overall effort to improve the quality of
human resources in Costa Rica and help alleviart the social costs of adjustment. The proposed
project purports to assist the Govermment in accomplishing its major sector objectives.
II. THEI EDUCATION SECTOR
A.   Overview
2,1        Until the onset of the economic recession in the 1980s. Costa Rica had for a long period
enjoyed a position of primacy among Latin American countries in the provision of social services,
including education. By the early 1960s virtual universal primary education had been achieved and
educational services were advancing on all fronts; adult illiteracy fell between 1973 and 1984 from
11.6 percent to 7.4 percent. Despite the economic downturn in the 1980s and concomitant, severe
cuts in the budget of MEP, expansion of services continued, with a 19 percent increase in the number
of schools, a 38 percent increase in the teaching force (see para. 2.13), and an overall increase in
enrollments of between 16 percent and 21 percent, mostly in pre-primary, primary and higher
education (Annex 4, page 1). in physical terms, this represented between 94,490 and 127,571 more
students.'' Expansion of this magnitude, driven by popular demand and intersified by the high 2.5
percent population growth rate, proved to be beyond the reiuced resources of MEP, and a sharp
decline in the quality, efficiency and cost effectiveness of basic education ensued. Symptoms of this
decline are underpaid teachers and insufficient investment levels for basic education.
B.   The Educatiua System
2.2         The formal education system-comprises one or two years of pre-primary schooling, nine
years of basic education in three cycles of three years each, and a diversified fourth cycle of upper
secondary education (grades 10-12) of either two years (for the academic course) or three years (for
the technical course). Basic education connotes six years of primary schooling (Cycles 1 and ':
grades 1-6), followed by three years of lower secondary education (Cycle 3: grades 7-9). The latter
is taught in and forms part of the secondary school systemr.  There is additionally a small number
1 / The higher figure includes enrollments in special education, including some evening and non-
formal courses. A matter of particular concern is that while there was a massive explosion of
enrollments in pre-primary (230 percent), first cycle (grades 1-3) (132 percent) and higher
education (121 percent in universities and 116 percent in para-universities), enrollments in the third
(grades 7-9) and fourth (grades 10-12) cycles dropped by 1 1 and 25 percent, respectively (para.
2.4).
2/ In almost every instance, the third and fourth cycles constitute a combined program for
secondas. education, housed in the same building. They include both academic and technical
schools. In academic schools, a limited prevocational content is offered in both cycles (10 to 20
percent of timetable loading). In technical schools, many of which were originally intended to offer
only the third cycle of education, a much heavier technical content was included (at least 50

of formal and non-formal day and evening courses in special education, adult literacy and make-up
classes. Post-secondary education i. provided by four state and nine private universities, plus four
public and a growing number of private para-university colleges, offering ftill- and part-time courses
which range in length from a few months to five or more years, depending on the qualifications
sought. Education is free throughout the pre-primary, basic and diversified secondary cycles, but
compulsory only for the nine years of basic educ:ttion.
2.3        Salient educational statistics for 1989 are presented in Table 2.0 below:
Table 2,0:SCHOOLS, STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BY EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, 1989

\1:   Schools and teachers at the secondary level serve students in both Cycles 3 and 4.
\2:   School figures are for public institutions only; a variety of private institutions also
exist.
2.4        Between 1980 and 1989 the number of primary students increased 21 percent, while
enrollments in pre-school and higher education increased 130 percent and 35 percent, respectively. In
the third and fourth cycles, however, enrollments declined sharply during the 1980s. In the third
cycle, which is for the majority of students the terminal cycle of education,3' enrollments fell by
almost 12 percent between 1980 and 1990, after a spectacular increase of more than 200 percent in
the preceding decade. Fourth cycle enrollments display similar characteristics, declining by almost 25
percent in the 1980s, after rising by over 300 percent in the 1970s (Annex 4, page 1). It may not be
pure coincidence that falls of this magnitude occurred during the period of economic crisis when,
undoubtedly, family survival took precedence over education. To some extent this is borne out by the
erosion of enrollments in evening classes, which fell by 34 percent during the same period. It is
clear, however, that another factor accounting for the fall in third and fourth cycle enrollments is the
deteriorating quality and growing irrelevance of third and fourth cycle education offered during the
2/(... contimued)
percent of school time). As those schools developed fourth cycle courses, this heavy technical
component was continued in both cycles.
Z/ Gross enrollment in grade 10 represented only 10 percent of grade 1 enrollment in 1989.



- 4 -
decade-A' There is no notable difference in enrollments between boys and girls, except in higher
education where 52 percent of all students are male apd 48 percent are female.
2.5        Nonformal vocational education is providOd by the National Training Insti ute (Ins!ituto
Nacional de Aprendizaje, INA) through a wide range of technical, commercial, and agricultural skill-
training courses, in centers established throughout the country.
2.6        The private sector's role in education, except at pre-primary and university levels,
remairis limited, enrolling overall less than 6 percent of the student population. However, its growing
participation in pre-primary and university education (11 and 17 percent of enrollments, respectively),
and its present dominance in para-university education (72% of enrollments), may point the way to
future sector developments (see Annex 6, page 3).
C.   The Structure of the Sector
2.7        MEP is responsible for all aspects of pre-primary, basic, and upper secondary
diversified education, including the right to inspect and control private educational establishments at
these same levels. At the present time, the Minister of Education exercises his functions through the
Higher Council for Education (Consejo Superior de Educaci6n, CONSUPE) of which he is a
member, and through a hierarchy of Divisions and Dire-ctorates within MEP (see Annex 2, pages 1-3,
for an organizational chart of MEP). On a day-to-day basis, most administrative matters are handled
by the Vice Minister of Education. For technical matters, the Curriculum Division (Ii4 professional
staff) is inter a&ia --sponsible for curriculum development and educational assessment, while the
National Center for i.idactic Materials (CENADI, 46 professional staff) is responsible for teacher
upgrading and preparation of educational materials (assisted by the School Supplies Unit in the
Administration Division). The National Center for School Building (Centro Nacional de
Infraestructura Ffsica Educativa, CENIFE) oversees school construction and maintenance. Out of a
total of 31,569 MEP employees, 3 percent (866) are administrative, 1 percent (363) are technical
staff, 10 percent (3,047) are service personnel and 86 percent (27,293) are teachers (see Annex 2,
page 4).
2.8        At the regional level each of the 17 regions into which the country is presently divided is
administered through a Regional Administrative Center (Centro Administrativo Regional) whose
Director exercises, at least nominally, administrative and technical control of all basic and upper
secondary schools in the area. Each region is further subdivided into between five and twelve
districts (circuitos), each of which consists of some 20 schools. The circuitos are administered by
school supervisors, and each school has a governing board responsible for the conduct of school
affairs, oversight of school expenditures, and mobilization of resources for educational materiale
These boards (called Juntas de Educaci6n for primary schools and Juntas de Administracion for
secondary schools) are composed of the school principal and local community and parent
4/ Rapid growth in the 1 970s included the establishment of 78 technical schools (37% of all
secondary schools). These 78 schools divide into 51 gricultural, 17 industrial arts, 3 commercial,
1 handicraft and six Regional technical schools (offering 32 different specialties). Poor equipment,
ill-qualified staff, outdated curricula and lack of materials have rendered many of these schools
obsolete and very poorly attended.



representatives. Two other bodies exercising significant influence over educational policy and
administration are the powerful teachers' unions and the often quite active parents' associations.
2.9        This implied decentralization of education planning and administration is more apparent
than real. Lack of human and financial resources severely limits the effectiveness of the sub-regional
education offices, whose work has become increasingly of a routine administrative nature. Decision-
making, even with respect to the most minor, yet often urgent day-to-day problems, is reserved for
the central authority, so that the system remains highly centralized, cumbersome and inefficient (see
para. 2.33). Only 10 percent of MEP's non-teaching personnel are located outside of San Josd (Annex
2). The Government's Public Sector Reform proposals (see para. 2.54) are intended inter alia to
revitalize the role and impact of regional and local administrative bodies.
D. Issues in Education
2.10       The overriding issues of the education sector are the worrisome declines in the quality
and efficiency of education, particularly in disadvantaged areas, which result from inadequate
funding, distortions in resource allocation, weak planning and administration, and continuous growth
in education demand. In addition, equity and the provision of equal education opportunities across
geographic and socio-economic groupings remains a critical concern. Table 2.1 provides a
quantitative overview of the deterioration of both educational inputs and outputs of basic education in
Costa Rica. This deterioration is further analyzed below.
1.   Ouality
2.11       Quality issues relate to: (a) student performance; (b) the supply and training of teachers;
(c) the relevance of curricula; (d) the non-availability of educational equipment and materials; and (e)
a deteriorating physical infrastructure.
a)    Student Performance
2.12       Low levels of student performance both at primary and secondary levels were
demonstrated on national achievement tests, carried out in 1987 on behalf of MEP by the University
of Costa Rica (UCR). The tests covered second, thrid and fourth cycle students (grades 4-12), in
each of the four basic subjects: Mathematics, Spanish, Science and Social Sciences. From these tests
five important facts emerged:
(i)  the pass level in all four subjects, at all education levels, average less than 30 percent;-'
(ii)  rural students performed significantly worse than their urban counterparts, at all
grade levels and in all subjects, averaging scores which were 37% below those of
urban students;
(iii) there is an inverse relation between the grade level of students and the percentage
achieving the minimum passing score in virtually all cases;

from 10.8 percent (Limdn) to 35.3 percent (Puriscal), with a national average pass rate
of just 22.5 percent; primary level Spanish pass rates were also extremely low,
averaging 24.2 percent nationwide and ranging from 12.0 percent (Lim6n) to 38.8
percent (Puriscal);

(v)   at the lower secondary level (grades 7-9) the lowest scores were in social studies, where
less than 2 percent of all students passed nationwide. Math and Spanish scores were
also abysmally low, with national pass rates averaging 2.8 percent and 7.3 percent,
respectively.
More detailed information on student performance can be found in Annex 7, pages 4-6.
b)   Teachers
2.13       Baig Educaion The sharp rise in enrollments in basic education (see para. 2.1)
necessitated the employment of more than 6,200 additional teachers between 1981 and 1989. This
was in addition to the replacements required for retirees, and more notoriously, given the very
generous pension arrangements, for the thousands of teachers being granted disabled status
(inpapacitdou) every yearY Because recruitment was difficult in the face of the profession's
unattractive image--exacerbated by salary erosion, which by 1987 amounted to 42 percent for
secondary teachers and 33 percent for basic education teachers of 1980 levels--the Government was
forced to employ more and more unqualified teaching staff. The number of unqualified or under-
qualified teachers rose from 3,028 to 5,782, accounting for 23 percent of all teachers in 1989. Of
these 5,782 teachers, 4,163 (72 percent) were only secondary school graduates (as2iranStp&, with
limited academic and no professional qualifications (see Annex 5, page 1). Many of them were
appointed to multigrade, single-teacher, rural schools, requiring special skills in classroom
management which these teachers lack.
2.14       As an indication of the low level of qualifications, an achievement test for aspirantes
seeking admission to UCR in 1985, pitched at the grade 6 level, revealed that only 10 percent of the
candidates attained the minimum acceptable scores in all four disciplines. This result was described
by the research unit in MEP conducting the test as "a crisis in learning".
2.15       Unfortunately, despite MEP's emergency teacher training program conducted jointly
with Costa Rican universities, analysis shows that the capacity of the program is insufficient to fill the
growing gap in both quantitative and qualitative terms (see para. 3.22 for related project activities).
Under this system (in place since 1986) aspirantes sign a contract with MEP which obliges them to
enroll in year-round certification programs in addition to their normal teaching duties, in exchange for
guaranteed jobs with MEP upon graduation. Classes are held on weekends and over the summer at
regional branches of the public universities, and include considerable home-study. Those teaching
grades 1-6 enroll in a two-year certification program (after which they would become diplomados ,
while those teaching grades 7-9 attend a third year for mastery of their particular subject (after which
they become profesoress. Current resources allow training for just 588 new teachers per annum,
while enrollment projections show that at least 1,337 new teachers per year are required between
1991 and 1996. This translates into an average annual deficit of 749 trained teachers (see Annex 5,
page 2 for projections of supply and demand for qualified teachers). To this deficit should be added
the number of teachers needed to replace the annual attrition of the existing stock of 15,200 teachers.
2.16       Finally, scarce resources have further limited MEP's provision of in-service training
programs and the technical/professional assistance which regular school supervision would have
_/ See World Bank, Costa Rica Public Sector Social Spending, Report No. 85-19, 1990.



- 8 -
afforded these teachers. Weak school supervision and inadequate in-service training has also
adversely affected the performance of qualified teachers of long service, who are unfamiliar with
modern advances in subject content and teaching methodology. The proposed project would provide
for both certlLcate and upgrading training for unqualified teachers and cover the training deficit for
the period 1992-1996. (See paras. 3.20-3.28 for related project activities.)
2.17       Diversified Education (grades 10-12). At this level, the principal issue is the quality of
the teaching force, in both academic and technical/vocational tracks. The reduction in the number of
teachers between 1980 and 1989 of less than 100 is more than compensated for by the large fall in
enrollments of almost 13,600 students. However, in quantitative terms, one in every five teachers
does not possess the minimum requisite academic or pedagogical qualifications (Annex 5, page 1).
c)    Curriculum
2.18       Basic Education. Present curricula are outdated in content and approach, reflecting
neither the concerns of parents and communities, nor the Government's educational and economic
aims. Neither do they make provision for the special needs of the rural, one-teacher school, in which
a single teacher must be able to handle all six grades of primary education. Recently, MEP revised
the curricula (at all levels of public education) to reflect modern scientific and pedagogical advances
and began pilot testing it in schools this year. But there is a need for the inclusion of new topics-
family life, health and nutrition, public safety, care of the environment and the fostering of traditional
culture and values (see para. 2.41). In addition, the role of women in society needs to be explicit and
more fairly represented, and the expanding and changing nature of Costa Rica's economy needs to be
reflected in textbooks and implications of the school programs. The proposed project would provide
support for the introduction of new curricula through the production and distribution of teaching
materials and teacher training. (See paras. 3.7 ff for related project activities).
2.19       Diversified Education. At this level, schools providing diversified education suffer from
the same disadvantages as primary education schools in terms of poor equipment, ill qualified staff
and outdated curricula. Moreover, the frequent lack of science facilities and the almost total absence
of modem technological equipment (e.g. computers) renders impossible the updating both of curricula
and teaching/learning methodologies. The proposed project would provide for an in-depth study of
secondary education's status and needs and support a pilot program of computer-assisted
teaching/learning at the secondary education level. (See paras. 3.42 ff for related project activities).
d)   Educational Equipment and Materials
2.20       The meager resources available for the quality enhancement of education (about 1
percent of total educational expenditures; see Annex 10, page 2, table 3) has left the schools severely
deprived of teaching/learning materials. Textbooks are out of date and in short supply; school
libraries are almost non-existent and even basic educational aids are often not available.
2.21       During the 1980s, faced with ever increasing enrollments and dwindling budgetary
resources, the Govermnent took several measures, with the assistance of bilateral agencies (principally
USAID) and the private sector publishing houses, to provide basic education schools with textbooks.
Between 1983 and 1987, subsequent upon setting up the National Schoolbooks Program, MEP



- 9 -
published and distributed nationally 48 titles covering the four core subjectsz' in grades 1-6; 12
complementary workbooks, 4 activity books and companion volumes for grades 1-3; aud a series of 8
short run (35,000 copies each) anthologies for grade 6 students. Subsequently, CENADI and twenty
subordinate Regional Didactic Centers (Centros Regionales de Did5ctica CEREDIs) were established
in 1988 to produce with the collaboration of local authorities, parents and the community, simple
teaching materials, especially for the sciences, and to train teachers in their use. Radio and television
educational programs - "Mathematics by Radio" and "Look and Learn", intended especially for rural
audiences, were broadcast. Efforts were made to furnish schools with equipment such as mathematics
and geometry sets, cubes, rulers, maps and simple libraries, but supplies were frequently insufficient
and equipment which was provided is now mostly lost, damaged or obsolete.
2.22        Needs, however, far outstripped available resources. With regard to textbooks, those
issued in the mid-1980s have outlived their natural lives (i.e., are lost, torn, excessively marked-up,
with pages ripped out, etc.), with no funds available to replace them. Meanwhile, the shortfall in
textbooks has been exacerbated by enrollment increases, which in the first cycle alone rose between
1982 and 1990 by 64,000 from 190,887 to 254,890. The extent of the present textbook shortfall may
be gauged from investigations suggesting that less than 50 percent of students in grades 1-9 have
textbooks. As regards other educational materials, a recent study identified shortages of 3,902 senior
and 8,800 junior mathematics/geometry sets, 2,540 maps, 2,120 basic libraries, and even such
rudimentary item as blackboards (450) and rulers (600). Measures to correct this situation are
essential for quality education, and the proposed project provides for development, production and
distribution of textbooks, supplementary materials, and distance educational materials (see paras. 3.9-
3.19 for related project activities).
e)    Physical Infrastructure
2.23        The same determinants of deterioration, increasing enrollments and reduced financial
resources, have seriously affected the condition of school buildings, aggravated by the lack of any
institutionalized schools maintenance system. The most recent national study (March 1991) estimates
that at the primary education level (grades 1-6) there is a shortage of about 630 new classrooms.
This need is additional to the existing physical facilities, which are effectively utilized at present.
Most of the existing classrooms (a total of 26,615) are operating on a double shift system. In fact, all
but 25 of the 3623 schools operate a double shift; 33 operate a triple shift (Annex 6, page 1). In
addition, about 3,500 existing classrooms (25 percent of the total number) are in urgent need of repair
and rehabilitation. Virtually all regional administrative offices are presently housed in rented
facilities, in which adaptation to suit the regional offices' expanded administrative functions envisaged
by the Public Sector Reform (see para. 2.54) and decentralization policies of the Government (para.
2.55) is neither legal nor practical. With regard to the school buildings, provision or repair of basic
sanitary facilities is required in 1,680 existing schools. Lastly, there are remote, rural schools
(approximately 1,000) where to attract and retain qualified teachers new or rehabilitated staff housing
would be needed (see para. 2.37). To meet all current infrastructure needs, it is calculated that a sure
of nearly US$60 million would be required. The proposed project would provide for construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance of physical facilities of highest priority (see paras. 3.29-3.36 for
related project activities).

2.   Efficiency
2.24       Not surprisingly, the efficiency of schools operating in such unfavorable conditions is
low, and this is all too plainly evidenced by high repetition and drop out rates, by student
performance, and by internal inefficiency. Inefficiency is of particular concern in rural areas, where
rates for all these indicators are far worse than in the metropolitan San Jose area (see para. 2.38 and
Annex 7). For example, drop out rates in Lim6n, Cartago and Calas are three times those of San
Jose, while the percentage of students completing grade six is 33 percent lower. High inefficiency is
closely correlated with poor socio-economic conditions, suggestirig a need to target any corrective
interventions on poor rural areas.
a)   Re.petio in
2.25       Between 1980 and 1989 repetition increased at all grade levels (see Table 2.1 and Annex
8, page 1). In 1989 it reached 19 percent in grade 1 and averaged 16 percent over the first three
grades (Cycle 1). In grade 4 repetition rose to 10 percent, and increased 31 percent over grades 4-6
(Cycle 2) to 8 percent. In grade 7 repetition increased to 18 percent, and recently doubled by 94
percent in grades 7-9 (Cycle 3) to 16 percent overall. Meanwhile, Cycle 4 repetition rates also nearly
doubled, rising from 6 to 11 percent throughout the diversified cycle (grades 10-12).2' Increasing
repetition of this magnitude is a clear indicator of falling educational quality.
2.26       Efficiency of basic education and total education expenditures inevitably declines in
situations of high drop out and repetition, since expenditures incurred for those children do not
achieve the intended educational objectives--in particular functional literacy and basic numeracy. The
level of such wasted expenditures has been high. As an example, the cost to the Government of
repetition in primary education (grades 1-6) is estimated for 1990 at close to US$11 million,
equivalent to 4.8 percent of MEP's recurrent budget.
b)   Dropout
2.27       While school drop out in Costa Rica has been more a characteristic of the later stages of
education, and retention rates in the first cycle of basic education have indeed improved slightly over
the past decade, in grade 1 alone in 1989, 3 percent of students dropped out during the year. In
grades 1-3 inclusive, 2.4 percent of enrollments, equivalent to almost 6,000 students, failed to
complete the course, leaving them as functionally illiterate; in grades 4-6 a further 3,000 left the
school system. The situation was far worse in the final three years of basic education (grades 7-9)
where dropout rates rose to 14 percent in academic and 17 percent in technical streams. The
diversified academic cy-le (grades 10-12) experienced a dropout rate of nine percent. Although the
economic crisis in Costa Rica during the 1980s undoubtedly forced more children to work rather than
attend school, dropout rates of this magnitude must at least in part reflect dissatisfaction with the
quality and relevance of the education being provided. (Further details on drop out can be found in
Annex 7, page 1 and Annex 8, page 2.)

c)   Internal Efficiency
2.28       Student success rates may be measured in two ways: the percentage of students
successfully completing a particular cycle, and the number of years required to graduate a student.
Unfortunately, as Table 2.1 shows, promotion rates have declined in all grades and in all three cycles
of basic education between 1980 and 1989. For basic education as a whole, the promotion rate has
declined an average of 14 percent. One of the bleakest features of this data is the ineffectiveness of
the education system at the third and fourth cycle levels, especially crucial for the development of
adequately trained manpower, which is key for economic development.
2.29       Confirmation of these problems can be seen in data on student graduation statistics
(Annex 8, page 3). These show that for the 1984 cohorts of students:
*    at the primary level (cycles 1 and 2), only 42 percent of students completed grades 1.6
within the prescribed six years; and only 78 percent within nine years:
*    it took almost one and one-third years on average for students to complete each grade of
the first and second cycles;
*    at the secondary level (cycles 3 and 4), a mere 28 percent of students completed the
course within the stipulated five years; and
*    1.6 years on average were required to pass each grade at the third and fourth cycle
levels.
3.   Funding
2.30       As stated in para. 2.1, notwithstanding the economic rczession of the 1980s education
services continued to expand apace throughout the decade. This same period is marked by the steady
erosion of MEP's budget, which between 1980 and 1988 declined from 14.9 percent to 12.9 percent
of total public spending, and from 6.7 percent to 4.8 percent of GDP (see Table 2.1 and Annex 10,
p.1). Two examples will suffice to illustrate the practical effects of these budget cuts. Because
growth in enrollments required the services of more teachers (see para. 2.1), 98 percent of MEP's
budget in 1988-89 was expended on salaries. As a result (i) non-salary per student expenditures over
the same period fell by 32 percent at pre-primary and primary school levels, and by over 20 percent
at lower- and upper- secondary school level; and (ii) MEP expenditures on school equipment and
materials in ttde three years 1987-1989 were cut by almost two-thirds (Annex 10). Indeed, investment
spend.ng declined from 27 percent of total education expenditures in 1980 to just 1 percent in 1989.
The implications of these cuts can be seen in the preceding discussion of declining educational quality
and efficiency indicators (see paras. 2.11-2.29).
2.31       A principal cause of the under-funding of basic and secondary education is external to
the MEP: first, the severe recession and debt burden in the 1980s forced the Government to reduce its
budget in real terms; second, MEP's share of total government spending declined sharply (as
mentioned in para. 1.2). Within MEP's budget, the constitutional requirement for public financing of
university expenditures at a fixed percentage, combined with the strongly negative political fallout
10/ Article 85 of the Constitution establishes a special fund for public higher education, whose
income (based on 25 percent of income tax revenue, 100 percent of the tax on real estate
transfers, and 100 percent of the tax on brokerage houses) *cannot be abolished nor reduced".



- 12 -
which might result from reductions in the university budget meant that the Government targeted its
most severe budget cutbacks on basic and secondary education. Thus, between 1980 and 1988
resource allocations for basic and secondary education fell drastically from 63 percent to 51 percent
of public expenditures on education, while enrollments increased by almost 16 percent. The effect on
the secondary subsector, where the reduction was from 26 percent to 18 percent of the total .M4EP
budget was to some extent cushioned by falling enrollments. In contrast, the less harsh cutback in the
primary education budget in no way compensated for the substantial rise in enrollments (which
increased 2 I percent between 1980 and 1989), such that per student spending declined by 32 percent
(see Annex 10).-" Meanwhile, university budgets between 1980 and 1982 rose from 34 percent to
40 percent of Government expenditure on education and remained there until 1987. Since then the
share of higher education as a percentage of the education budget has decreased, but it still remains
excessively high.0' The Government has indicated, however, that it intends to increase basic
education spending and generate increased cost recovery at the higher education level. During
negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on levels and composition of sector
expenditures (para. 4.6).
4.   Planning and Administration
2.32       Resources for education are ineffectively, inefficiently and inequitably allocated, as a
result of weak administration, a wholly inadequate information system, and excessive centralization.
2.33       Administration. Effective sector planning and management is thwarted by: (i) the lack
of a clear definition of the respective functions of the subdivisions of MEP, leading to duplication of
effort (e.g. between CENADI and the Curriculum Division); (ii) an inadequate and archaic
management information service which inhibits the effective planning and con'rol of educational
expenditures between regions, the deployment of staff, prioritization of infrastructure and educational
equipment needs, and the evaluation of student and teacher performance; and (iii) overcentralization,
seen in the fact that personnel management throughout the country, administrative and tecnnical
supervision of schools, and all resource allocation decisions, are handled by MEP administrators in
San Jose. Curriculum revision and teacher training needs are similarly hindered by overcentralization
and the lack of an institutionalized national student testing scheme. This situation is reflected in the
regions where, given the highly centralized education system and the lack of human and financial
resources, the supervision and control of the quality of education is limited and the role of local
education authorities is reduced to the collection and transmission of unprocessed data (see Annex 2,
p.ge 4 for distribution of MEP personnel). The proposed project provides for institutional
strengthening both at central and regional levels by improving management information systems,
establishing regional education centers, delegating more authorities, resources and responsibilities to
11/  Between 1980 and 1988 primary education's share of MEP's budget was maintained around
36 and 37 percent, and starting in 1989 it increased to 38 percent, and then to 39.8 percent in
1990 and 39.2 percent in 1991.
1 2/ The share of the education budget for universities decreased from 39 percent in 1987 to 37
percent in 1988, 36 percent in 1989, 33 percent in 1990, and 33.5 percent in 1991 (including the
US$23 million increase specified by the Executive decree of June 6, 1991 (see para. 2.54 below]).
During 1980-89, higher education enrollments increased about 35 percent. See Annex 10.

the regions, strengthening student testing and evaluation programs and carrying out staff development
programs (paras. 3.37-3.41).
2.34       Instructional Time. Research has rev-eatedly indicated that instructional time is positively
related to student achievement. In this respect, twc factors contributing to the low achievement levels
and efficiency throughout the public education sector, relate to the length of the school year and the
organization of the school time. Regarding the length of the school year, a variety of national, local
and religious holidays had reduced the number of school days to a nominal 171 per annum.13' With
respect to the school calendar, there is in rural areas frequent absenteeism from school in times of
seasonal agricultural activities (planting, harvest, etc.), which frequently leads to repetition and
dropout. As a consequence of the project preparation process, the school year in Costa Rica has been
extended to 181 days. To complement this change, the Government agreed at negotiations that the
utilization of school time be the objecL of a study under the proposed project (para. 3.39). The study
will assess how many days a year and hours a day are actually dedicated to educational activities in
different regions and types of schools, the time allocation for the various activities scheduled and
developed, how effectively and efficiently students and teachers spend their time at school and what
kind of adjustments, if any, have been made or are needed to meet regional and seasonal socio-
economic characteristics.
2.35        Supervision. The paucity of financial resources for education, and the weaknesses in
central authority planning and administration, are mirrored at regional level. The remoteness and
inaccessibility of many rural schools, lack of transport and funding for supervisory visits (supervisors
receive approximately US$25 per month to cover all room, board and transport costs, which typically
lasts about three days), and inadequate staffing at regional and district levels, have left all but the
most easily reached schools unvisited and unsupervised, some of them for as much as three years. It
is important to point out that these remote, unsupervised schools are those most often staffed by
unqualified teachers who are in greatest need of professional help and guidance. Additional resources
are needed to resolve this key issue in quality education.
5.   EAuity
2.36        Expenditures. It has already been pointed out that underfunding of rural primary
schools in particular stems as much from distortions within the sector as from overall cuts in MEP's
budget (see para. 2.31). Furthermore, the centralized nature of MEP's budget means regional
expenditures are difficult to analyze with precision. However, two proxies for regional expenditure
imbalances are class sizes (which indicate the number of teachers) and the qualifications of teaching
staff (which indicate salary levels). Consistently, poorer, rural regions (e.g. Pdrez Zeled6n, Coto,
San Carlos, Guapiles, Cafias, and Lim6n) have higher student-teacher ratios and much higher
n/ Government reports show that in 1986, a nominal school year of 176 days varied in effect
between 134 and 157 in the different regions; in 1987 the school year was standardized at 171.
However, the school day is shortened considerably by the use of double-shifting in almost all
schools (Annex 6, page 1), which makes for a 4 and 1/2 hour school day as compared to the
normal 6-hour day.



- 14 -
proportions of unqualified teachers.L' (See Annex 7, page 1.) Fewer and less qualified teachers
translate into far lower expenditures for these areas compared with urban regions such as San
Josd.L' While an analysis of non-salary allocations to the Jt!ntas de Fducacion (see para. 2.8) by
region indicates that regions which have unfavorable socio-economic conditions have received more
money than those with relatively favorable conditions, these expenditures represent just 1 percent of
MEP's budget and thus have little impact in redressing re.gional inequalities.
2.37       The high percentage of unqualified teavhers ir marginal rural areas is partly due to
extremely difficult working conditions. Often, these areas are without running water, electricity,
means of communication and transport. In the past, MEP provided teachers with an incentive to
work in these areas, by offering them modest teacher houses (367 were built between 1976 and
1986). An evaluation of this program by MEP showed that it has worked well, is well-targeted, and
has encouraged experienced teachers to work in rural areas, but coverage of identified needs has been
severely limited by financial constraints (see "Rural Teachers Houses Program Report, 1976-1991" in
the Project Files, Annex 18). That is, the administrative and technical procedures have been worked
out and successfully implemented, and qualified teachers have remained when they otherwise might
have left; the problem is funding to provide a greater number of houses. The proposed project would
provide for construction of about 110 teacher houses in remote, marginal areas where it has [roved
difficult to attract qualified teachers (para. 3.33).
2.38        Quality and Efficiency. The effects of inequitable provision of educational services on
children's learning and educational progress are entirely predictable. As Annex 7, page 1, shows, the
percentage of single-teacher schools and rates of drop out and repetition are highest in these
disadvantaged regions, and progression rates and student performance as measured by the National
Tests of 1986 and 1987 are far lower than the national averages (rural students scored an average of
37 percent lower than urban students). Finally, the variation in regional primary completion rates
(which range from 88 percent in San Jos6 to 60 percent in Coto) points out the serious negative equity
impact of budgetary distortions and low quality inputs for rural areas. This suggests that project and
program interventions should target rural regions. The proposed project provides for educational
inputs, in particular teacher training and physical facilities, in marginal and poorer areas (see paras.
3.20, 3.30 and 3.33).
E.   The Government's Sector Strategy
1.   Basic Education
2.39       The Government's General Plan for Education (GPE) for 1990-1994 places greatest
emphasis on improving the quality, efficiency and relevance of basic education. This goal is to be
pursued through a multifaceted strategy which includes as objectives: higher student achievement,
14/ Thirty seven percent of the teachers in these five regions were unqualified in 1989, compared
to 15 percent in the central metropolitan area (San Jose, Alajuela, San Ram6n).
j5/ The Bank's sector report, Costa Riga Public Sectr Social Spend nL, also showed sharp
differences in expected educational benefits per child across income groups. The richest quintile's
expected benefit is almost two and a half times the expected benefit of the lowest income group,
while the benefit in the fourth quintile is nearly two times greater.



- 15 -
improved administrative efficiency and more rational resource allocation, increased exposure to civic
values, introduction of environmental education, and expansion of both formal and nonformal
educational opportunitiesL6. The proposed Bank/IDB financed project supports implementation of a
large part of this plan. The Government's objectives as detailed in the GPE are to be achieved
through the technical and administrative measures described below.
a)   Technical Measures
2.40       Quality improvements in education will be promoted by the following technical
measures: curriculum development, provision of instructional materials, staff training, educational
assessment, and improvenments in school facilities, includ.ng their maintenance.
2.41       Curriculum Development. In accordance with the GPE work program for 1990, MEP
upgraded curricula at all levels of public education, after conducting an extensive national survey
regarding curriculum needs, and began pilot-testing it in schools beginning in March 1991. New
study programs have been designed to reflect modern scientific and technological advances (see para.
2.18), and will be further developed in 1992 and 1993 to include an integrated approach to the study
of ecology, family health and hrman relationships, public safety and cultural values (see para. 3.7 for
related project activities). While the core subjects (Spanish, Mathematics, Science and Social
Sciences) will be given special emphasis, due regard will be paid to artistic and cultural education.
Curricula will be sequenced to flow naturally from grade to grade and between educational cycles.
For the first three grades ar integrated subject approach will be followed; thereafter curricula will be
subject-based. The third cycle of basic education (grades 7-9) and the diversified cycle (grades 10-12)
will be subject to a far-reaching evaluation in order to detzermine measures for addressing issues of
relevance and efficiency (see para. 3.42 for related project activities).
2.42       Instruictional Materials. In support of tb, new curricula, new textbooks, student work
books and teacher guides will be produced and distributed throughout the basic education school
system in years 1992-94 (see para. 2.20 for issues and para. 3.9 for related project activities).
CENADI will be responsible for supervising the production of textbooks, the publishing, printing and
distribution of which will be contracted out.0  A cost recovery scheme, tailored to the parents'
ability to pay and operated through a revolving fund within the MEP School Supplies Unit
(Departamento de Suministros Escolares, DSE) will provide funds for future textbook reprinting,
building upon the successful revolving fund system currently managed by DSE for the sale of low-
cost materials to local school boards (the Ju=  .
2.43       Classroom teaching equipment and school libraries will also be provided (see para. 3.17
for related project activities). CENADI will develop prototypes of education aids which, after testing,
will be mass produced under contracts with private firms. A series of posters on the production of
educational materials by teachers and students using local mnaterials will alseo be produced by
CENADI. The selection of school library and reference books will be the responsibility of

CENADI's School Libraries Division. To supply these materials MEP plans to increase the budget of
CENADI's School Supplies Unit by 50 percent by 1994.
2.44       Distance education technologies, already well established in the National University for
Distance Education (Universidad Nacional de Educaci6n a Distancia, UNED), will complement
classroom instruction, and assist the unqualified teacher in particular to improve the conient and
presentation of lessons. A radio mathematics program, adapted from the Honduran model, will be
broadcast nationwide for all Cycle I students. CENADI will also produce: an environmental
education program; a musical and educational activities program (Recreo en el Aula); a bilingual
program adapted fromn the Dominican Republic; and infornmational programs for parents and teachers
concerning the new curriculum and evaluation requirements (see para. 3.19 for related project
activities). These programs will offer year-round access to educational material to all students,
especially those in remote rural areas.
2.45       Staff Developmrent. The deterioration in the quality of the teaching force (see para.
2.13) represents one of the most serious setbacks to the quality of education in Costa Rica, requiring
a comprehensive and institutionalized training service (see Annex 5 for details on declining teacher
qualifications). MEP's objective is to invoke a complete change in teaching philosophy, from
memoriter teaching to interactive learning. Pre-service training courses will be expanded and
improved to reach the large number of newly hired but unqualified teachers (aspirantes) who require
both academic and pedagogical courses.-L' More experienced, but still underqualified, Cycle 3
teachers (autorizados) will receive tailor-made upgrading courses in specialized subjects and
pedagogical training. For all other practicing teachers, upgrading courses in the new curricula,
modern pedagogical techniques, evaluation, and the development and use of educational materials will
be provided (see para. 3.21 for related project activities).
2.46       Special emphasis will be given to those teachers working in single classroom schools
(unidocentes), providing specific guidance on the techniques of multigrade teaching. These teachers
represent more than 30 percent of all basic education teachers, typically working in disadvantaged
rural areas and often lacking any institutional support (supervisors, school directors, etc.).
Experimentation in multigrade teaching methodology, notably the Escuela Nueva project in Colombia,
has demonstrated its effectiveness in rural areas.
2.47       The training service will be inter-institutional in design, with formal agreements between
MEP aiid the universities. The participating universities (UCR, UNED, UNA and possibly others)
will be responsible for all certification courses (for aspirantes and autorizados); upgrading courses will
be the responsibility of CENADI, with inputs from technical departments within MEP. These
programs already exist in Costa Rica but on a reduced scale. As noted earlier (see para. 2.16 and
Annex 5), current resources are insufficient to meet the need for qualified teachers. Curricula and
learning materials have already been designed and tesled, the regional training facilities exist, and
systems for selecting trainees and hiring supplemental instructors are in place.L-' In short, these are

autorizados their salaries will increase about 25 percent. All other teachers will receive promotion

oroven programs with successful implementation experience-in essence the Government would simply
expand and extend these programs under the proposed project (see paras. 3.20 ft).
2.48        To complement this program, a parallel training service for administrative and
supervisory personnel at all the levels will be implemented (see paras. 3.38-3.39).
2.49        To encourage teachers to adopt new m,'thodological approaches, eighteen demonstration
schools (three in each of the six regions), representative of the different types of schools found in the
education system (one-teacher schools, primary schools and secondary schools), will enable teachers
to observe interactive pedagogical techniques in action (see para. 3.28 for related project activities).
2.50        Student Evaluation (see para. 2.33). Closely related to curriculum development and staff
training, educational assessment will be expanded and improved at all levels of basic education
(grades 1-9). The Government's objective is to develop a three-pronged, permanent evaluation
system fully integrated into the educational process. This will mean: (i) frequent in-class testing
throughout the school year to stimulate students and provide important feedback to teachers;
(ii) diagnostic testing on a sample basis to assess readiness to learn (grade 1), acquisition of basic
literacy and numeracy skills (grade 3), and mastery of basic education subject matter (grade 9);?Z!,
and (iii) yearly comprehensive testing of all grade 6 students for purposes of primary level
certification. This combination of daily monitoring, diagnostic sampling and universal certification
will make assessment an integral part of basic education, providing students, teachers, parents and
administrators with the information they need to improve the quality and efficiency of basic education
(see paras. 3.40-3.41 for related project activities).
2.51        Physical Infastructure (see para. 2.23). Over the longer term schools will be brought
up to acceptable physical standards, approximately one-half by 1994. Priority attention will be given
to 150 schools damaged or destroved in the earthquake of April 22, 1991 (estimated total cost of
US$2.4 million), and to those rurzi schools most in need of rehabilitation. The provision of furniture
and equipment is also included in this program (see para. 3.30 for related project activities).
2.52        A permanent institutionalized school maintenance service will be established. CENIFE
will become responsible, following a pilot project recently initiated with funding from IDB, for
developing a permanent program of school building, furniture and equipment maintenance (see para.
3.36 for related project activities).
b)    Administrative Measures
2.53        To ensure that quality education in the classroom is matched by efficient administration
of the system, the GPE calls for:

2.54        Geographical Restructuring (see para. 2.33). The Public Sector Reform legislation (Law
No. 5525 of May 2, 1974) specified by the Executive decree of June 6, 1991, is designed to
restructure the existinig 17 education regions into a system consisting of six principal regional
education offices, with responsibility for educational administration at the local level being delegated
to: (i) 12 subregional offices, consistent with population and school density; and (ii) 4 administrative
support offices, in the most sparsely populated areas (see map). This structure aims to achieve the
optimum effectiveness of existing personnel,>' while delivering a more streamlined technical and
administrative support service to schools at the point of need, thus breaking through the rigidity and
remoteness of the existing highly centralized administration system. This should promote the
decentralization of education services, and improve both administrative efficiency and resource
allocation. The GPE calls for all restructuring to be completed by early 1992.
2.55        Decentralization. The above geographical restructuring will involve a shift of
responsibility for school administration from the central authority to the regions and subregions.
Many of the tasks (personnel management, resource allocation, the administrative and technical
supervision of schools) will devolve upon regional and local education offices, subject only to the
policies and guidelines determined at ministerial level. A more participatory role in education is
proposed for the conmnunities, parents' associations and school directors. To undertake such duties,
modern offices, appropriately equipped with MIS computer hardware and software, and electronically
linked to the central authority are a sine qua non (see para. 3.34 for related project activities).
2.56        Strenathening of MEP's Administrative Capacity. Over-arching MEP's decentralization
is the ability of central MEP authorities to administer the system. The GPE calls for the restructuring
of MEP with clearly defined inter-and intra- ministerial linkages and responsibi;ities. This
restructuring has now been completed and awaits only the publication of a MEP decree to give it legal
effect. The establishment of an effective management information service at both central and regional
levels will provide more efficient control of personnel, finance and budget, and educational
evaluation, while the collection and processing of educational data, and the development of a national
schools testing service will assist the process of decision making in terms both of educational policy
and the allocation of human and financial resources. A comprehensive multi-year training program
for MEP administrative staff will be required to operate the system (see para. 3.38 for related project
activities).
2.    Secondary Education (see paras. 2.10-2.12)
2.57        While the improved quality and efficiency of basic education constitutes the principal
objective of the Government's National Development Plan for 1990-1994 (NDP), the reform of
secondary education also forms part of the Government's strategy. In order to determine appropriate
means of addressing the issues of quality, efficiency and relevance in secondary education, the
Government plans to initiate a thorough evaluation of structure and needs throughout the secondary
system, in all modalities (see para. 3.42).
2.58        New methodological approaches will be introduced into the academic schools including

approach and provide continuity to the five-year experiment in computer-assisted learning at the
primary level implemented through the Omar Dengo Foundation (see para. 3.43). Lessons from
experience under the Omar Dengo program, as well as assistance from UNED, which successfully
operates a computer-assisted training course, will help the Government in the conceptualization and
implementation of the secondary school pilot project.
2.59       Overall, the Government's strategy is based on its own sound analysis of Costa Rica's
educational constraints and priorities.= It appears both financially and administratively feasible. If
implemented, both internal and external efficiency should increase, with the decrease in repetition and
dropout rates (stemming from investments in curricula, educational materials, teacher training and
assessment), and in the number of MEP administrative staff (stemming from decentralization and
public sector reform).
2.60       Through its implementation it should also contribute to redressing the imbalances in
current resource allocation within the sector. Basic education expenditures (grades 1-9) should
increase in real terms, and as a percentage of total MEP spending. Moreover, allocations for non-
salary costs for basic education as a percentage of total allocations for basic education should also
increase (see para. 4.6 and Annex 12, page 4).
F.   Past Bank Experience and Lessons Learned
2.61       To date the Bank has made only one education loan to Costa Rica. Loan 915-CR, for
US$6.2 million was signed in June 1973, became effective in December 1973 and was closed in
March 1981, after two extensions for a total of 27 months. Project objectives were: the expansion of
educational opportunities particularly in rural areas for lower secondary education; the strengthening
of third cycle (grades 7-9) education by broadening its pre-vocational approach so that pupils were
better prepared to enter the Diversified Cycle (grades 10-12); improvement of the quality of education
through better physical facilities and equipmer.; and assistance to INA in improving its ability to
respond to occupational training requirements throughout the country by expanding its installed
capacity with a view to covering the country as a whole through the establishment of regional centers.
2.62       The Project Performance Audit Report No. 3983 (dated June 21, 1982) highlights the
following principal conclusions: (i) in spite of a considerable time overrun of 92 percent in physical
implementation, the project was successfully implemented. Its educational objectives were achieved
on the whole and exceeded in some respects. Cost overruns of 31 percent were attributable to
implementation delays due to the slow start up, initial problems in coordinating the activities of the
three agencies involved, the slow procedures of the government procurement agency, and
unexpectedly high inflation rates; (ii) the project was instrumental in the application of refomr
programs related to agricultural and general secondary education and accelerated vocation,'l training;
in gaining recognition of the importance of curriculum development and staff development; and in
bringing opportunities either for formal lower secondary education, or non-formal vocational training,
to hitherto deprived rural primary school graduates; and (iii) the Borrower acquired valuable expertise
22/ This analysis was greatly aided by Sanguinetti's study, La Educacion General en Costa Ricj.,

in school facilities planning and design, the development of inter-disciplinary committees and in
school maintenance techniques.
Lessons Learned from Experience under Loan 915-CR
2.63       The positive evaluation of the project by OED reflects Bank thinking on secondary
school vocational/technical education in the decade of the 1970s and the socio-economic conditions in
Costa Rica at that time. The Bank's disappointing experience with this type of technical education,
and the dramatic and unconstrained growth of agricultural schools in Costa Rica in the following
decade, could not have been foreseen. Nonetheless, even with these caveats there are the following
important lessons to be derived from that experience.
2.64       Project Design. In developing countries with limited implementation capacity, complex
projects involving a number of implementation agencies should be avoided. In the proposed project,
MEP would be wholly responsible for project implementation, although, based on an agreement
signed on September 3, 1991, MEP would work through the schools construction unit (Edificaciones
Nacionales) of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Ministerio de Obras Piblicas y
Transportes, MOPT) for school construction (see para. 3.47). Moreover, the priority provision of
financing for the proposed project and the essential coordination among implementing agencies and
the budgetary authority would be ensured through the establishment of a project account for
counterpart funds (see para. 4.13).
2.65       Project Execution. The creation of Project Implementation Units (PIU) frustrates
opportunities for Government agencies to acquire expertise in project management. An existing unit,
suitably reinforced as necessary, will materially assist in institution-building. The proposed project
would be managed by an existing institution, MEP, suitably reinforced with limited technical
assistance (see para. 3.47), mainly for procurement, accounting and architectural issues. A Project
Coordinating Unit (PCU) would only be responsible for monitoring and coordination of project
implementation (paras. 2.77 and 3.49).
2.66       Procurement. Especially in countries where procurement of goods and services is a
lengthy and bureaucratic procedure, the implementation schedule should be carefully monitored to
ensure that the acquisition of furniture, equipment and teaching materials coincides with the
co.npletion of the school bu!lding program. The implementation schedule of the proposed project has
taken account of this requirement. Furthermore, model procurement documentation has been agreed
at negotiations (see oara. 4. 10), and the first year implementation should be ready before the Loan is
approved by the Bank 1paras. 3.21, 3.36, and 3.41). Finally, a consolidated work plan and budget
for the following year would be submitted annually and discussed with the Bank (see para. 3.52).
Lessons From Other Countries
2.67       The proposed project is part of the Government's education sector strategy and includes
measures for the improvement of public education in general, and in particular, the quality, efficiency
and relevance of basic education. Bank experience in education projects suggests that such
improvements are best effected by interventions in several key areas, including administration, teacher
training, didactic materials and evaluation capacity. Selected lessons gathered by the Bank from three
decades of education project design, implementation and supervision, as conveyed through seventeen



- 21 -
Latin American Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), some Working Papers and other
studies, are summar. ..d here.>'
2.68       Project Design. Experience in several education projects in Latin America points to the
disadvantages of projects which include multiple objectives, diverse components and several
implementing agencies. As a result, projects in recent years have placed emphasis on simplicity of
project objectives and content. Projects should exclude components inconsistent with the j1.ain foctus
and overall objectives of the project, and educational models or methods not supported by previous
country experience should be avoided unless the project component is experimental. On sensitive
issues, closer attention should be paid to the need for broad consensus within the education
community (central administration, teachers' unions, parents) on the nature and purposes of reform
and its requirements. When project design becomes too complex and ambitious, implementation
becomes difficult, and more innovative elements, in particular, are not successfully carried out. The
proposed project focuses clearly on basic education quality and efficiency, and includes administrative
strengthening as a means inter alia of improving the education sector's effectiveness. The secondary
education component is designed primarily for the purposes of identifying future policy and project
interventions and on a pilot basis. (See paras. 3.3-3.5 for a summary description of these
components.)
2.69       Administrative Development. One of the issues raised in a large-scale study on Bank-
financed education projects (Verspoor, 1989) concerns the relative neglect of administrative
development and organizational change in the design of educational change strategies. Some case
studies illustrate that strengthening the administrative capacity of the educational organization at all
levels is a critical step in the process of successful implementation of educational change. The data
suggest that assistance for strengthening school support and supervision systems, improving the
quality of school management, establishing a permanent capacity to carry out critical professional
fun'tions such as curriculum and materials development, and measuring student achievement and
testing have not featured as prominently in the lending for educational change as the literature
suggests they should. The proposed project is explicitly designed to address administrative
development and organizational change issues, as a means of improving basic education sector
policies and effectiveness (see paras. 3.37-3.39).
2.70       Decentralization. A wide variety of country and Bank experience, including the growing
Latin American experience with regional education authorities, has demonstrated that decentralization
has played an essential role in coordinating the delivery of reasonably complete packages of inputs to
the schools. However, since the longer term economic and educational consequences of
decentralization are still difficult to isolate, scholars have focused instead on issues of implementation.
Decentralization policies are most successfully implemented if: (a) there is a tradition of self-reliance
in local communities; (b) local governments or communities have their own sources of tax revenues
and voluntary contributions; (c) the pressure for decentralization originates in the community rather
than with ministry planners; (d) all important affected political groups, especially teachers, are
involved in and informed about the deveiopment of decentralization plans; and (e) administrative
capacity at the local level either exists or is provided through training. Fortunately, Costa Rica has a
long tradition of local community involvement in the schools (exemplified by the school boards,
2.i/ See Annex 18 for a list of World Bank documents consulted for this section.



-22 -
JJuntas de Educaci&n, made up of parents and community leaders). The proposed project would also
provide extensive training to local administrative staff as part of the project (see para. 3.38).
2.71       Teacher Training. Examining 21 successful Bank education programs, Verspoor (1989)
has determined that a well-designed and effectively implemented in-service teacher training program
was a key element in the successful implementation and institutionalization of programs for
educational change. Four elements stand out as key features of successful teacher training
components: the provision of permanent and locally available in-service training; the establishment of
effective systems for supervision and support; the adjustment of the content of training to teachers'
levels of knowledge and experience; and encouragement of teacher motivation and commitment. In
several instances, teacher training programs failed as a result of a lack of financial and human
resources required for successful implementation. Accordingly, the proposed project places
considerable emphasis on the development of teacher training, strengthening the locally available in-
service training programs, complemented by the improved supervision system through
decentralization, and providing financial incentives for the teachers to participate actively in the
training programs (paras. 3.20-3.28).
2.72       Textbooks. Bank experience shows that provision of teaching materials, especially
textbooks, plays an important role in improving the quality of education. There is a general need for
closer collaboration between curriculum development and textbook development and publishing.
Governments insist to varying degrees upon state influence on school curriculum and consequently on
textbook content, but this should not mean that textbook design and manufacturing must also be done
by local firms; the choice between local and international publishing and printing should be based on
economic analysis. The proposed project would provide for local authorship of textbook prototypes,
but publishing and printing of textbooks would be through international competitive bidding (see para.
!           3.16).
2.73       It is generally assumed that textbooks should be provided free of charge to students.
However, Bank experience has shown (Farrell & Heyneman, 1989) that in many countries parents are
expected to pay for their children's books, and that in some countries even very poor parents are
willing to pay at least a small sum for textbooks. The proposed project incorporates this willingness
to pay through a textbook revolving fund, which: (i) is based on an analysis of capacity to pay (as
indicated by socio-economic indices); (ii) builds upon a successful revolving fund MEP already
operates for the sale of educational materials; and (iii) will provide resources for a second printing of
these textbooks four years after their initial distribution (see para. 3.12).
2.74       Although an adequate supply of textbooks is essential for effective learning, simply
providing books will have little effect if teachers have not been trained in how to use them and if
there is a shortage of ancillary learning materials like workbooks, teachers' guides, blackboards,
pencils and chalk. The proposed project would provide all teachers with three days of orientation to
the new textbooks (see para. 3.21), with continuous follow-up through supervisors. Workbooks,
teacher guides, and supplementary educational materials would also be provided (see para. 3.17).
2.75       Educational Evaluation Capacity. Bank experience shows that the sustainability of
educational reform programs depends to a greate extent on monitoring, testing, and evaluation
systems. Relatively few developing countries have established a sustainable capacity for educational
monitoring and evaluation. As a result, the efforts of governments and assistance agencies to improve
education have been hampered by lack of information, especially on outcomes and costs. Lessons



23 -
from the Latin American experience suggest that standards, requirements and financial incentives for
evaluation should be tied to institutional capacity development at the national, regional and school
levels of education systems. However, the strategies should be iiicremental, putting systems in place
at relatively low levels of technical sophistication first, then raising the technical level as institutional
capacity is developed. Staff training and development, especially in the social science and education
faculties of universities, is essential to developing sustainable capacity. The proposed project would
initially use existing institutional capacity for educational evaluation in UCR (see para. 3.41),
complemented by considerable staff training and development for MEP staff, who would
progressively assume assessment responsibilities over the life of the project.
2.76       Experimentation. Experimentation and learning from experience have been key factors
in the successful implementation of ambitious education change programs. In 1978, the Bank was
advised by its External Advisory Panel on Education to increase its support for introductory testing
and experimentation to provide reasonable assurances that a possible large-scale replication would not
result in serious mistakes. The proposed project includes a pilot small-scale experiment in computer-
assisted learning at the secondary education level, in which twenty schools would be provided with
computers and extensive complementary training. Evaluation studies would compare over time
achievement and efficiency indicators in these schools with indicators in schools without computers, to
assess the impact of this program and determine the advisability of expanding it in later years (paras.
3.43-3.45).
2.77       Proiect Implementation. Bank experience reaffirms the importance of designing projects
within the managerial capacity of the implementing agency, and greater care should be given to
devising appropriate arrangements for implementation. Continuity of staff within the PCU has been
very important for the successful implementation of projects. Some successful projects have
confirmed the lesson that competent project management can be assured by utilizing a PCU leader
with significant experience in managing previous social projects, especially those financed by IBRD.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on a proposal for the appointment of the PCU Director,
and on the structure and staffing plan for the PCU (see para. 3.49). Evidence of the establishment
ard staffing of the PCU, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan effectiveness (see
para. 6.2 b). Furthermore, advance preparation is important for successful and efficient project
implementation. Indeed, implementation of many projects has been impeded by slow start-up. To
ensure that implementation of the proposed project could start soon after loan signing, the
Government had taken at negotiations all important initial actions for the first year of project
implementation.
G.   Bkionale for Bank Involvement
2.78       Bank support for improving educational quality and efficiency is an integral part of its
country assistance strategy, which aims at supporting Costa Rica's stabilization and structural reform
efforts to create conditions for economic recovery and growth while minimizing the costs of social
adjustment. Rehabilitating and promoting cost-effective, high quality basic education programs would
(i) facilitate the Government's fiscal adjustments by enhancing the efficiency of public resource use
and (ii) help develop human resources by providing trained ar ' trainable manpower to meet the
country's changing economic and labor market needs. In addition, the Bank's involvement in the
sector would help the Government redirect its resources toward underprivileged groups in the
marginal urban and rural areas, thus minimizing the social costs of the Goverment's adjustment
programs. Moreover, as Chairman of the Consultative Group for Costa Rica, the Bank has the



- 24 -
advantage in mobilizing external aid funds on soft terms, which propitiate education sector reform.
Indeed, at the Bank's invitation, IDB has agreed to co-finance this project on soft loan terms.
111. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Concept and Objectives
3. 1       Government strategy, as outlined in its NDP, has accorded highest priority to the
improvement of public education. While the focus is primarily on basic education (grades 1-9), it
recognizes that an effective public education service, responsive to the needs of its citizens and to the
country's economic well-being, must address deficiencies throughout the primary and secondary
education subsectors. The project is designed to support the Government's education sector strategy
and priority programs, as outlined in the NDP and the GPE (see paras. 2.39 ff), and to assuage the
present ills of the sector by addressing the issues of quality, efficiency and relevance. Although many
of the benefits expected to flow from the project would reach the whole population, the main thrust is
directed towards disadvantaged rural comrnunities.
3.2        To achieve these objectives, the project comprises three main components: (a) the
comprehensive improvement of the quality of basic education; (b) the improvement of the sector
planning and management; and (c) limited improvements in secondary level education. Each of these
components, their subcomponents, and their sources of financing are shown in Table 3.0 and
described below. Since the proposed project is to be cofinanced with an IDB loan, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that if IDB exercises its right. under the loan agreements signed with the
Government. to invoke legal remedies. the Bank will have the right to invoke its legal remedies under
the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements (January 1. 1985) (see para.
61 a), Also. the signing of the Loan Agreement between the Government and IDB would be a
condition of Loan effectiveness (see para. 6.2 a).

Information System at the central and regional levels. This would include: the provision of
computers and staff development programs, especially in the areas of personnel management,
financial and budgetary control, and educational planning (data collection, analysis and feedback); and
an institutionalized evaluation unit, whose functions would include a schools testing program to
measure student performance. The component would also support the creation of a permanent
schools maintenance system.
3.5        Imprgvement in  e Quality of Secondary Education (3 percent of total project costs).
This component would consist of: (i) a thorough needs evaluation study at all levels and in all
mnodalities of secondary education to determine policies and means for improving the quality,
efficiency and relevance of secondary education; and (ii) on a pilot basis, promoting interactive
learning and enhanced student performance by the provision of computers, the revision of curricula,
ancl the training of teachers and administrators in some 20 selected secondary academic schools.
C.   Proiect Description
Component 1: Improvement in the Quality of Basic Education
3.6         Primary determinants of educational quality are: well designed curricula, supported by
the provision of appropriate didactic materials and enhanced by a well-trained teaching force; and an
adequate learning environment, with school buildings and equipment which support teacher and
student activities. The objective is to combine these inputs with a student-centered interactive
learning approach, breaking the present mold of "chalk and talk", teacher-directed, memorization-
intensive learning. Included in this component are a number of experimental or demonstration
schools representative of the diverse types of schools within the system (one-teacher schools, rural
primary schools and secondary academic schools) within which this new teaching methodology couid
be observed and evaluated.
a)    Curriculum Development
3.7        The project would support the development of the new curriculum for grades 1-9 being
introduced this year (see para. 2.41), through the publication of teaching materials corresponding to
four sub-components of the new curriculum: (i) adaptation of course content and teaching examples to
reflect regional and local realities; (ii) integration of new subject areas including ecology,
health/nutrition, family life, public safety and civic values; (iii) the application of more interactive,
student-centered teaching/learning strategies; and (iv) assessment, which includes continuous
monitoring of students and periodic achievement testing. All teachers would be introduced to these
materials through training modules which would be part of the 5-year teacher upgrading program (see
para. 3.24). Responsibility for curriculum development would lie with MEP's Departmnent of
Curriculum.
3.8        All activities under this component would be financed by the IDB (see Table 3.0) and
would include: five months of international and one month of national technical assistance to help in
the analysis of the newly revised curriculum and design of teaching materials; training of 100 regional
technical advisors (who will subsequently train teachers and parents); orientation of parents to new
subjects and methods for increasing their participation; printing and distribution of teacher materials;
supervision and evaluation of teacher responses to the new curriculum in the classroom; equipping of
18 demonstration schools with radiocassette players, mimeograph machines, overhead projectors and



- 27 -
movable furniture (desks and chairs); and equipping of MEP offices with audiovisual equipment,
computers, mimeograph machines, bibliographical materials, one vehicle and other supplies which
would permit the production and evaluation of teaching materials, Other activities financed by the
project, such as teacher training and production of learning materials, would be closely coordinated
and integrated with the activities under this subcomponent (see para. 3.24).
b)   Didactic Materials
3.9        The project would provide three types of educational materials: (i) textbooks, workbooks
and teacher manuals; (ii) supplementary materials such as library books, posters, maps and science
equipment; and (iii) distance education materials via radio, audio cassettes and television. These
materials are known to enhance student motivation and achievement, and would complement the new
curriculum being introduced which stresses a more active student role in the educational process.
This entire component would be financed by the IDB (see Table 3.0).
3.10       Textbooks The project would finance the preparation, publishing, validation, printing
and distribution of new textbooks throughout grades 1-9, to replace textbooks distributed in 1985,
many of which have been lost, become dilapidated and are in any case obsolete for the new
curriculum. Approximately 1,892,400 textbooks and 32,500 teacher guides would be produced over
a four year period. The publishing and printing program would be sequential: for grades 1,4 and 7
in year 1 of the project; for grades 2, 5 and 8 in year 2; and for grades 3, 6 and 9 in year 3. The
new textbooks would thus become available successively in the first year of each cycle in year I of
the project, progressing through the cycle in logical sequence in each subsequent year. In the first
three grades an integrated textbook would be used; in the remaining grades textbooks for each of the
four core subjects (Spanish, Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences) would be produced.
For each grade the four new topics mentioned in the curriculum development subcomponent (see
para. 3.7) would be introduced: ecology, family and community life, health and nutrition, and public
safety; traditional culture and values would be an overarching theme, with local adaptations to meet
regional life styles.
3.11       To avoid delays in adapting the new curricula during the printing and distribution of the
new texts, teachers' guides and training would be provided to explain how to adapt existing material
to the new curricula (see para. 3.24).
3.12       Cost Recovery. Textbooks would be financed through a revolving fund set up in
DSE. DSE would sell textbooks on credit at full cost less standard trade discount to the local
School Boards (Juntas de Educacidn) responsible for overseeing school expenditures, and they in turn
would repay the costs over a four-year installment plan. The Juntas would rent out the textbooks to
students at conditions ranging from full cost recovery to free provision in accordance with each
community's ability to pay, as assessed by the recently updated Poverty Index (Indice de Desarrollo
Social).3' Alternatively, students would be able to purchase textbooks through private distributors
241 A smaller revolving fund for educational supplies already exists, operated by DSE.
25/ Analysis of the Poverty Index and previous MEP experience with educational material fees
suggests that 50% of the communities can pay 100% of the annual rental fee (approximately
(continued...)



- 28 -
contracted by ME."; a portion of these sale proceeds would go to the revolving fund. Cash flow
projections show that after four years MEP would have a sufficient amount in the revolving fund for
a reprinting of the full series of textbooks.
3.13       Three months of technical assistance would be provided to DSE for the design of a
computer-hased financial administration system for the operation of the revolving fund, including staff
training in its use.
3.14       Student Workbooks. Complementary student workbooks for grades 1-6 would be
prepared by CENADI and MEP's Department of Curriculum, but they would be printed and
distributed by the private sector, to be purchased by parents in the market.29 Consequently, the
project would finance only the workbook preparation. In the case of the third cycle of basic
education (grades 7-9), the project would finance the preparation and printing of 7,150 sets of
pamphlets and activity cards in each of the four core subjects which would replace student
workbooks. These would emphasize activities for research, creativity and experiential learning.
3.15       Production. Printing and Distribution of Textbooks. CENADI would be responsible for
supervising the production of textbooks, the publishing, printing and distribution of which would be
contracted out. CENADI would participate in the preparation of the textbook prototypes, assisted by
a team of subject specialists, after which they would be fieldtested and revised prior to printing.
Three months of technical assistance are included in the project for textbook writing, design and
illustration.
3.16        Contracts for printing would be on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Printing and paper quality would be such that the textbooks should last at least four years. The
contract price would include the cost of distribution to regional and sub-regional education offices
whence they will be collected by the local Juntas de Educaci6n for distribution to schools. School
classrooms would be used temporarily for storage purposes as needed.

US$1 per book); 40 percent of the communities can pay 50 percent of the rental fee; and 10
percent will receive books free of charge.
26/ The rationale for distributing textbooks and workbooks differently is threefold: (i) while
textbooks can be used repeatedly, workbooks are basically composed of exercises which the
student fills in, making them of little use to students the following year: (ii) workbooks are less
essential than textbooks and can be shared if needed, so MEP provision is less important; and (iii) a
relatively well-functioning market in the private sector already exists for workbooks; this should be
encouraged rather than eliminated. MEP's partnership with private sector publishers and distributors
for the production and sale of student workbooks works as follows: (a) MEP finances the
preparation of the workbook, typically contracted out to private publishers, thereby establishing
copyright authority; (b) through international competitive bidding MEP receives bids for the printing
and commercial distribution of the workbooks. Bid evaluation is or' the basis of: lowest price; best
guarantee and greatest coverage of distribution; and highest perceni-'ge of sale proceeds to be paid
to MEP (typically at least 15 percent); (c) with sale proceeds MEP buls student workbooks for
school zones located in areas with the worst Social Development Ind.ces (see Footnote 30 for an
explanation of this Index).

3.1t7      Supplementary Educational Materials. The project would also finance a wide range of
educational materials for use in the schools: 165,850 library and reference books (to be distributed to
all schools as follows: packages of 35 books to 1,480 single-teacher schools; packages of 50 books to
1,553 schools with 50-300 students; and packages of 10) books to 364 schools with more than 300
students); 3,400 locally designed and well received valiias diddcticas (one per school);,7' 3,750 maps
and globes (one of each for schools with 1-3 teachers and two of each in schools with 4 or more
teachers); and 3,400 sets of posters (one set per school), promoting the use of local low cost materials
for producing teaching aids and providing student-based information on such topics as family,
nutrition, public safety, cultural traditions and protection of the environment. Third cycle academic
schools (grades 7-9) would also receive portable science laboratory equipment (one set per school)
and supplies. Finally, towards the end of the project a MEP study on the development and use of
educational materials in the classroom would be financed.
3.18       School library and reference books would be selected by CENADI's Department of
School Libraries; other educational material will be designed by CENADI and mass produced and
distributed under contract by private firms.
3.19       Distance Education Technologies. The project would finance: (i) the adaptation from
Honduras of 450 existing radio mathematics programs; (ii) the production of 208 environmental
education and 40 cultural/educational activity (Recreo en el Aula) radio programs; and (iii) the
production of 72 20-minute educational television/video programs (Viendo y Aprendiendo) for
students, and 192 five- and ten- minute training programs for teachers (promoting the use of local
material for the production of low cost teacher aids and innovative teaching methodologies). This
would require the purchase of minimum recording and mixing equipment for the production of these
programs. In addition, the project would distribute student workbooks and teacher guides to the
programs, as well as cassettes and cassette players to remote rural schools beyond the reach of radio.
An evaluative study by MEP on the use of distance education technologies in the classroom would
also be financed under the project.
c)   Teacher Training
3.20       The project would support a comprehensive training program aimed at (i) providing
introductory courses for secondary school graduates entering the teaching profession, and (ii)
upgrading skills of teachers, school principals and supervisors. The main objectives are to: (a) end
the entry into the teaching profession of secondary school graduates without any in teaching skills; (b)
increase teachers' subject matter knowledge; (c) broaden their command of instructional strategies and
increase their use of interactive, experiential pedagogical techniques; and (d) improve their ability to
handle multigrade teaching, monitor and evaluate student performance. Although all teachers would
eventually be reached, priority attention would be given to those lacking their teaching certification
who are also, typically, those teachers working in rural areas. This entire component would be
financed by the Bank (see Table 3.0).

chalkboard, simple mathematics instruments, basic geography and science equipment, reading and
writing model examples, feltboard, and educational games.



- 30 -
3.21       The project would provide two types of in-service training activities: year-round
certification programs run by the universities, for 4,420 newly hired graduates of secondary school
and other uncertified teachers;9' and modular upgrading courses for all teachers (16,650) working
in grades 1-9 academic schools (Annex 5). These medium term courses would be supplemented by
specific short courses in: (i) the use of textbooks (all 16,650 teachers, but phased to correspond with
the grades of the textbooks being introduced each year); (ii) multigrade teaching techniques (1,411
teachers); and (iii) bilingual instruction (180 teachers). Teachers would also visit demonstration
schools for observation of new instructional techniques. In addition, special training programs for
staff involved in the secondary school pilot project would be provided. All training would be
coordinated and overseen oy the Interinstitutional Planning Commission for Teacher Training
composed of MEP, the three public universities offering certification programs and the National
Commission for Higher Education (CONASUP). During negotiations. the Bank reviewed and
reached agreement with the Government on an implementation plan for the teacher certification and
ungrading program for the first vear of proiect implementatiQn (see Annex 18. B 9). as well as on an
Agreement between MEP and the three universities (UCR. UNA  UINED) offering certification
programs (see para. 6.1 b): implementation plans fqr each subseguent year of projet implementation
'would be discussed and agreed upon at each annual review meeting (see para. 6.1 c!)
3.22       Certification Training. The certification programs would be organized and managed by
three state universities (UCR, UNA and UNED) under the direction of the National Council of
University Rectors (Consejo Nacional de Rectores, CONARE), in close association with MEP. The
participation of additional universities may eventually be sought. As a condition of disbursement for
any such additional universities, the Government would furnish evidence, satisfactory to the Bank.
that each such university (i) has the capacity to carry out such programs. and (ii) has entered into an
agreement with MEP fQr such purpose (see para. 6.3 a). Courses would be offered in two
modalities, further differentiated by the grade levels to be taught. The first modality would be for
recent graduates of sezondary school (asoirantes) hired by MEP to fill teaching vacancies in Cycles 1,
2 and 3 (grades 1-9). Under this system (described in para. 2.15) apirantes sign a contract with
MEP which obliges them to enroll in year-round certification programs in addition to their normal
teaching duties, in exchange for a guaranteed job with MEP upon graduation. Classes are held on
weekends and over the summer at regional branches of the public universities, and include
considerabie home-study. Those teaching grades 1-6 would enroll in a two-year certification program
(after which they would become diplomados), while those teaching grades 7-9 would attend a third
year for mastery of their particular subject (after which they become profesoresl. Before beginning
the certification program and their first year of teaching, all aspirantes would participate in a 40-hour
intensive orientation course during the summer. Enrollment and teacher attrition projections suggest
that by the end of the project the shortage of qualified teachers would be eliminated at the primary
level, and existent teacher certification programs would be sufficient to replace on an annual basis all
teachers leaving the profession. At the secondary level, additional resources to existing university
programs would still be required to meet teacher deficits, as secondary enrollments are expected to
increase throughout the decade (see Annex 5, page 2).
3.23       The second modality would be for Cycle 3 teachers (grades 7-9) who may have several
years of experience and some form of teaching or other higher education degree, but lack their
ZA/ 2,928 asoirantes for grades 1-6, 819 pasirangs for grades 7-9, and 673 &torizados for
grades 7-9.



- 31 -
teaching certificate for this level (so-called autorizados). These teachers would follow a similar
program of weekend and summer classes at regional branches of the public universities, differing
from the aspirantes program in the level of instruction and focus or. mastery of specific subject matter
(math, science, Spanish, etc.). That is, each autorizado would enroll in a tailor-made program
reflecting his/her experience, previous education, area of specialization and academic requirements for
certification, which would then be integrated with the normal teacher training courses offered by the
universities. It is estimated that given the previous education of autorizados, they would need on
average two years of weekend and summer classes to obtain their profesorado degrees .' For all
certification training, the Bank would finance the costs of the teacher trainers (university professors)
and some basic teaching equipment; MEP would finance the selection of aspirantes; the universities
would finance costs of transportation and per diems for professors who must travel to regional
training centers, and logistical support; the students would pay for their educational materials (30-
page anthologies per course).
3.24       Upgrading Training. For all certified teachers in grades 1-9 a comprehensive modular
training program would be offered, providing a minimum of 36 days of training in: interactive
instructional techniques; production and application of learning materials; curriculum development and
introduction of new subjects (ecology, family life, health/nutrition, security, civic studies); daily
monitoring and periodic assessment; new methods for teaching of reading, writing, oral expression
and mathematics; and strategies for increasing community participation in the educational process.
Modules wouli be presented over the five-year life of the project, during five-day intensive training
sessions in the week before the new school year begins and on various Saturdays during the course of
the school year.
3.25       The project would support the planning and organization of the program; the preparation
of course materials, the selection and training of trainers, the actual provision of instruction, and
program supervision and evaluation. Courses would be organized and overseen by CENADI which
has responsibility within MEP for teacher upgrading. The contents and materials for the courses
would be supplied by the corresponding MEP divisions (e.g. modules for interactive instructional
techniques and new subject areas would be designed by the Curriculum Deparanent, while modules
on assessment would be developed by the Division of Evaluation and Quality Control).
3.26       Training facilities would include the regional MEP offices, branches of the public
universities, fourth cycle schools and other MEP facilities as required. The project would finance
limited upgrading (equipment and furniture) of regional MEP offices for this training. While
attendance at these courses would be voluntary, promotion and salary incentives exist (as part of the
Civil Service Code, based on the number of course hours and satisfactory course completion) such
that 100 percent participation is expected. The enthusiastic attitude previously shown by teachers for
upgrading courses reinforces this assumption.
3.27       In addition to the 36-day upgrading course offered to all certified teachers, a series of
specialized courses would also be organized. This would include: (i) a 5-day course offered once a
j/ Upon receiving their degrees aspirantg  would receive a 27 percent salary increase, while
autorizados would receive a 22 percent increase. By the end of the project this will result in an
increase in MEP's total wage bill of 3.7% (see Annex 14). During appraisal mission Costa Rican
authorities have confirmed the Government's willingness and capacity to assume these costs.



- 32 -
year on multigrade instruction for 1,411 teachers working in such schools; (ii) a 5-day course once a
year on bilingual instruction for 180 teachers working in Costa Rica's indigenous areas; (iii) a three-
day orientation course for the new textbooks, such that as textbooks for each grade level are
introduced, all teachers working at that grade level would receive training; and (iv) 5 days of training
each year in interactive instructional techniques for teachers working in the 18 demonstration schools.
3.28       The project would also finance per diems (US$10) to enable teachers to visit
demonstration schools during the school year for at least two days. Teachers would visit the school
correspending to their school type (multigrade, Cycle 3 or complete Cycles I and 2). They would
observe new teaching mlvthologies which emphasize participatory, interactive and experiential learning
(as opposed to rote memorization) and see examples of locally produced and innovatively applied
iearning materials. While the modular training programn would provide instruction and some practice
in these areas, the demonstration schools would provide an important example of the new
methodologies and materials in action.
d)   Infrastructure
3.29       The magnitude of the problem of school infrastructure deterioration is beyond the
Government's financial resources and implementation capacity to resolve over the lifetime of the
proposed project (see para. 2.23 for estimated total financing needs). Therefore, a phased
reconstruction/rehabilitation program has been formulated to give priority attention to schools in the
country's most disadvantaged areas and in the area affected by the earthquake of April 22, 1991.
3.30       Primary Schools. The project would support the rehabilitation of approximately 2300
dilapidated classrooms, the construction or replacement of approximately 20W, and the construction of
182 new classrooms at the primary level (grades 1-6). This total of 2,540: (i) provides for
reconstruction of 150 classrooms in schools damaged in the earthquake of April 22, 1991; (ii)
represents about half the infrastructure needs in basic education; and (iii) is distributed across the six
regions of Costa Rica. and, within each region, in priority orde- of need as assessed by the
Government's recently updated Social Development Index (Indice de Desarrollo Social [IDS]).3'
By definition, the schools included in the project are almost without exception located in the poorest
rural areas of the country, and are predominantly small single-teacher schools. This supports the
Government's strategy of attending on a priority basis those small schools with limited alternative
classroom accommodation. With respect to school replacement, the criteria used is a cost estimate for
repairs exceeding 50 percent of the cost of a new classroom; in regard to new classrooms, an
30/ The IDS is based on information gathered by the Ministry of Planning (iVIIDEPLAN) as part of
the Social Indicator System (developed with assistance from UNFPA in 1985). The index is derived
from eight indicators: percentage illiteracy; percentage population aged 12 or older with no more
than a primary education; percentage population without health insurance; percentage of children
with low height-age ratios; percentage of households without electricity; percenLage of households
without running water; percentage of homes in need of repair; and average number of minutes
from nearest health clinic. For each indicator districts are ranked best to worst in deciles, with
each decile group allotted a point corresponding to its ranking (e.g. a district in the second decile
received two points). Each district's points are then averaged to determine the IDS, which ranges
between 1 (most favorable) and 10 (most disadvantaged). See Annex 7, page 1 for more details.



- 33 -
enrollment in excess of 35 students per teacher using double shifts has been used together with
enrollment projections to 1995.
3.31        The project would also finance the cost of basic furniture, equipment and sanitary
installations, in addtion to the remodeling of the computer classrooms for the twenty academic schools
to be equipped with computers.
3.32        IDB would share with the Bank the financing of this component (see Tldble 3.0). Each
international financial institution would be responsible for the civil works program in three of the six
regions. Full details of the Bank involvement are contained in Annex 9.
3.33   Houses for Teachers. To assist in the appointment and retention of well qualified teachers in
the more remote and the poorer areas, the project would support the construction of about 110 houses
for teachers (see para. 2.37 for a justification of these houses). Construction would be in the poorest
marginal areas where it has proved difficult to attract teachers. No staff houses would be built in the
first year of project implementation. The proposed localities of teacher houses to be built with project
financing in subsequent years would be discussed and agreed upon at the annual review meetings (see
para. 3.52). Houses would be 'tied", i.e., allocated only to the teacher(s) employed in that school,
and included the provision of housing would be in staff vacancy announcements as an incentive to
attract high quality teachers. It would be a condition of house allocation that any underqualified
teachers occupying school houses would enter into a formal agreement to undergo the certification
training course. preferably outside the teachers' working hours. Government assurances to this effect
were provided at negotiations (see para. 6.1 d).
3.34        Regional Centers The project would support the construction and equipping of four, and
the remodeling of two, of the six regional centers respectively to provide the minimum requirements
for these new administrative tasks (see para. 2.55 for a description of these centers).
3.35        While most of the civil works are for existing schools, where legal title to the sites will
already have been established, at negotiations, the Government provided evidence that with respect to
new constructions programmed for the first year of the project. the sites have been secured and are
available for the initiation of activities (see para, 6.1 e?. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that in successive years of the proect evidence that sites reuired for new construction have been
secured and are ava able for the initiation of activities would constitute _n  of the annual work plan
review (see para. 6.1 f)l As conditions for disbursements against expenditures incurred in the
construction/equipping of regional offices. the Government would submit evidence satisfactory to the
Bank that: a) the MEP Decree had been published, giving effect to the regionalization and
decentralization of the education sector as provided for by the Public Sector Reform legislation: (ii)
the attributes and authority of the Regional Centers had been clearly established. providing for a
propQrly decentralized system: and (iii) key staff for each of the six regional offices had been
appointed (see para, 6.3 b).
3.36        School Maintenance The IDB recently approved Project ATN/SF - 3409 - CR  for
approximately US$1.5 million to establish an institutionalized National System of Preservation and
Maintenance of all putlic schools, including furniture and equipment. The project, to be executed by
MEP's CENIFE, is expected to be completed in about 3 years and leave firmly established a well
experienced organism operating a well tested system. It may, however, be the case that at the end of
the IDB project, funds are lacking to operate the maintenance system, specifically in respect of



- 34 -
institutions provided for in this education project, and which will have come on strearn in the year or
years prior to the completion of the IDB project. The project would provide about US$300,000 to
ensure the maintenance prograei for the project institutions (financing equipment operations and
repairs, furniture repairs, and salaries for maintenance staff).
Component 2: Strengthening of Sector Plannin and Management
3.37       The project would support a series of measures designed to: (a) strengthen the
managerial and institutional capacity of MEP, and the decentralization of the education system; and
(b) develop within MEP a national student testing and evaluation system.
(a)  Institutional Strengthening
3.38       The Institutional Strengthening element would be financed by the IDB. At the central
level the project would finance the installation of a computerized Management Information System
and the strengthening of key MEP di .isions (personnel management, budgetary and financial control,
education statistics and educational evaluation, supervision and'administration) with the provision of
technical assistance and staff development programs. This system would be devised to ensure that
data and information are available in timely fashion to allow for the development of coherent sector
planning and to expedite the decision making process in respect of budget allocations and financial
control, personnel deployment, sensitive administrative matters such as the prompt pas .ent of
salaries, and above all those aspects which impinge most strongly on the qualitative aspects of
education: the receipt, processing and evaluation of educational statistics, as well as such physical
inputs as infrastructure and educational equipment needs. To achieve this, a strongly decentralized
and effective management system at regional level, with constant flow of information and feedback
between central and regional levels, is imperative.
3.39       The project would therefore also support the strengthening of the regional education
centers, by providing: basic physical facilities, adequately equipped and computerized; and training of
administrative and supervisory staff, including school principals, in management skills, evaluation of
student and teacher performance techniques, curriculum development (for adaptation of national
curricula to local conditions), as well as in the more routine tasks of data collection aid analysis. A
special and important responsibility which would devolve to the regions would be the technical
supervision of schools, and the in-service support and training of teachers. To fulfill these additional
responsibilities some administrative and technical staff would be relocated from San Jose to the
regions, and where necessary additional staff would be hired at the regional level. As a
countermeasure, positions at the central level which are currently unfilled would be eliminated, such
that MEP would experience a small net reduction in total numbers of administrative staff. The
distribution of resources to schools and the authority to fill teacher vacancies, which would also fall
within their remit, would materially assist the improvement in the quality of education. By increasing
staff, responsibilities and resources at the regional level, the system would afford more linkages with
the district education offices, the Juntas de Educaci6 (primary schools), the Juntas de Administracidn
(secondary schools), and parent and community organizations. Finally, the Bank and the Government
agreed at negotiations that the utilization of school time (see para. 2.34) would be the object of a
particular study to be conducted during project implementation. The study, for which preliminary
terms of reference were agreed upon during negotiations (see Annex 16), would assess how many
days a year and hours a day are actually employed in education activities in the different regions and
types of schools, the time allocation for the activities scheduled and developed, how effectively and



- 35 -
efficiently students and teachers spend their time at school and what kind of adjustments, if any, have
been made or are needed to meet regional and seasonal socioeconomic characteristics. At
negotiations. the Government agreedto furnish terms of reference for a study on the utilization of
school time by June 30. 1992, conduct the study by June 30. 1993, and prepare an action plan on the
basis of the reco,mmndations of the study by September 30. 1993. and thereafter carry out the  iLon
plan inaccordance with a timetable satisfactory to the Bank (see para. 6.1 g).
(b)   Student Evaluation and Testing
3.40       The project would support the development within MEP of a small Schools Evaluation
Unit which by the end of the project would assume responsibility for student testing and evaluation
(see Annex 17). The plan is to develop sociometric tests for new entrants to primary education
(grade 1), diagnostic tests on completion of the first and third cycles of education (grades 3 and 9
respectively) and accreditation tests for primary education graduates (grade 6). This project
component would be financed by the Bank. During negotiations. agreement was reached on the tyes
and timing of student testing and evaluation activities. Diagnostic tests would cover grade 1 students
on a sample basis; assessment tests would cover students in grades 3 and 9 on a sample basis: and
certification tests would cover all grade 6 students: all tests would be conducted annually (see Dara.
6.1 h).
3.41       Initially the tests would be the responsibility of the Research Institute for the
Improvement of Education in Costa Rica (Instituto de Investigacion para el Mejoramiento de la
Educaci6n Costarricense [IIMECI) of the UCR, an organization with lengthy experience in school
testing. Four MEP professional staff would be attached to to collaborate and be trained in school
testing; the three MEP staff who presently constitute the incipient Evaluation Unit would be trained
abroad in one year master's level degree courses in Evaluation and Testing. Evaluation activities
would be financed by the Bank and would include: (i) staff training, at home and abroad; (ii) test
construction, validation, administration, and analysis; (iii) equipment, library books and training
materials for IIMEC. At negotiations. the Bank reviewed and agreed on the contract between MEP
and IIMEC (see para. 6.1 i),
Component 3: Improvement in the Quality of Secondary Education
a)   Evaluation of Status and Needs in Secondary Education
3.42       In order to determine measures for addressing issues of quality, efficiency and relevance
throughout the secondary system, a six-month study would be conducted to evaluate needs at all levels
and in all modalities of secondary education. At negotiations, preliminary terms of reference for this
study were agreed upon (see Annex 16). Principal areas of focus for the study would be student
achievement, efficiency, and socioeconomic data, and would provide a analytical basis for addressing
the abovementioned issues. The study would review existing literature and conduct investigations in
other related fields. At negotiations. the Govermnent provided assurances that it would submit terms
of reference for the secondary education needs study by June 30. 1992. and that the results of this
study would be made available _atthe time of the mid-term 1roiect implementation review (,ee pa.
61j)p, Both this activity and the pilot computer-assisted learning program described below would be
financed by the Bank.



- 36 -
b)   Improvement in the Ouality of Secondary Academic Educatipfl
3.43       To foster the improvement in the quality of education across the secondary level,
experimental programs in secondary academic schools would complement the new methodological
approaches in primary education. The project would therefore finance a two-stage experiment in
computer-based education in up to twenty secondary schools. In the initial stage, up to ten schools,
varying in size, location (urban/rural) and study programs, would be equipped with microcomputers
including software. These would be distributed to the schools in proportion to their enrollments and
on the basis of one computer for thirty students.31' From a range of seven school subjects, the
schools would select two or more, depending on the length of the school day and the number of
subjects which could be accommodated, to allow an average of one period per week per subject for
each student.
3.44       New curricula would be developed by the MEP Department of Curriculum for each of
the seven subjects. A continuous evaluation process by school directors and supervisors would
culminate in a comparative study of student achievements in the experimental, as compared with
traditional, schools. At negotiations, preliminary terms of reference for this study were agreed upon
(see Annex 16). Review of the results of this study would form part of the mid-term review of
project implementation, during which a decision would be reached regarding the second and final
stage of the experiment. Assurances were provided at negotiations that the preliminary results of the
study. including an in-depth cost analysis. would be ready for discussion at the mid-term review (see
para. 6.1 k). Submission of the terms of reference for this study would be a condition for
disbursement for this subcomponent (see para. 6.3 c).
3.45       Training courses would be organized for: the 20 school principals; central and regional
school supervisors; every teacher of each of the seven basic subjects (on a repeated basis); computer
technicians in charge of the laboratory; and MEP's Committee for Computerized Education. Visits
by teachers to UNED, where a proved and successful computer-based education training course
exists, and study visits abroad would also be financed by the project. A condition for disbursement
agiainst this component would be the receipt of the iumplementation plan. satisfactory to the Bank. and
of an evaluation study acceptable to the Bank of the Omar Dengo primar schools computer proiect
(see para, 6.3c
D.         Project OrganizationJmplementation. and Management
3.46       Project Readiness for Implementation. The project was prepared by existing units of
MEP and MOPT, headed by a Coordinating Committee chaired by the Vice Minister of Education
and assisted by six technical groups from corresponding MEP departments and divisions. Each
technical group, staffed with experienced personnel (most of whom worked full-time on project
preparation), was responsible for the preparation of one component of the proposed project: staff
development, evaluation, educational materials, curriculum development, administration and
information systems, and physical infrastructure. In the later stages of preparation considerable
technical assistance was provided by both the IDB and the Bank. MEP's organization of project
preparation functioned smoothly and with appropriate assistance MEP should be capable of
31 / Scheduling would permit computer usage on the basis of one computer per two students at a
given time.

implementing the project. During negotiations, the Goverment provided plans and programs for the
first year project implementation. They are: (i) an implementation plan for the teacher certification
and upgrading program, includir.g the agreement between MEP and the universities for carrying out
the training program; (ii) no staff houses will be built during the first year; (iii) evidence that the site
required for the construction of the regional office has been secured for the initiation of activities; (iv)
a copy of the contract between MEP and IIMEC, with respect to the school evaluation and testing
subcomponent; (v) a proposal for staffing the PCU satisfactory to the Bank; and (vi) prototype
designs and standard bidding documents for civil works, goods and services. The project would be
completed by June 30, 1997.
3.47       Project Organization and Management. Project implementation would be carried out
within the existing organizational structure of the MEP. Overall authority for project management
would be vested in the Vice Minister of Education, assisted in the day to day management by a PCU
(see para. 3.49). With the assistance of outside specialists that would be provided under the project,
MEP's departments and divisions (see para. 3.48) should be capable of ensuring the prompt and
efficient implementation of their respective project components.
3.48       CENADI would be responsible for the preparation and/or purchasing of didactic material
and for the design, organization and implementation of the teacher upgrading program. MEP's
Department of Curriculum would be responsible for implementation of the proposed revisions to the
curriculum, for the implementation of the national educational testing program, for the organization
and implementation of the secondary schools computer education pilot program. Didactic material
distribution would be handled by MEP's Administration Division through its School Supplies
(Suministros Escolares) unit. Based on an agreement that was entered into by the Ministries of
Education and of Public Works and Transport on September 3, 1991, the schools construction unit of
MOPT would be responsible for all construction; and CENIFE would be responsible for the
infrastructure maintenance program. The Planning and Educational Development Division if MEP
would be responsible for overall planning of the infrastructure component.
3.49       The PCU, reporting directly to the Vice Minister, would coordinate project activities.
The PCU would be responsible for such implementation functions as consolidating the yearly work
plans of executing agencies, coordinating activities among participating agencies, providing
administrative backup services, carrying out project financial management, and monitoring and
evaluation. The PCU would be established and staffed on a full-time basis with a Director, an
architect or engineer, a procurement specialist, an accountant and two educators, all with experience
and qualifications acceptable to the Bank. During ngotiatiQns. the Government presented to the
Bank. and agreement was reached on, a proposal for the-pointment of the PCU Director. and on
the structure and staffing plan for the PCU: assurances were also provided that the PCU would be
maintained during the proiect implementation period with the characteristics agreed upon with the
Bank (see para. 6.1  . Evidence of thef establishment and staffing of the PCU. satisfactory to the
Bank. would be a condition of loan effectiveness (see para. 6.2 bL
3.50       To familiarize staff of the Ministries involved in the project wth Bank procedures and to
ensure a more effective project start-up, a project launch seminar would be conducted prior to loan
effectiveness.
3.51       Monitoring and Evaluation. The PCU would be responsible for overall project
monitoring and evaluation on the basis of key performance indicators (see Annex 12). During



- 38 -
negotiations. agreement was reached on final monitoring and evaluation indicators (see para. 6.1 m
and AnnexL 12. The PCU would consolidate and forward to the Bank, no later than June 30 of each
year, annual project implementation reports assessing progress toward meeting the targets in the
implementation schedule; a work plan for the implementation of project components during the
following fiscal year would be submitted to the Bank for review no later than August 31 of each year.
3.52       The MEP would conduct, jointly with the Bank and IDB, annual project implementation
reviews no later than September 30 of each year to: (a) analyze the previous year's performance and
budget allocation; (b) analyze the proposed work plan and budget for the following year; (c) review
progress in the decentralization process; and (d) discuss and agree on adjustments in project
implementation including the schedule of implementation. At negotiations. assurances were provided
that the Government would: (a) consolidate and forward to the Bank. no later than June 30 of each
year. annual proiect implementation reports: (b) submit on an annual basis a consolidated work plan
and budget for the following fiscal year by August 31: and (c) conduct annual project implementation
reviews by Septem-ber 30 of each year (see para. 6.1 n).
3.53       At negotiations. the Government also provided assurances that the MEP would:
(a) conduc. with prior approval of the terms of reference by the Bank. a mid-term implementation
review, no later than two and a half years after project effectiveness, to analyze project
implementation experience and possible project impact (with a focus on the monitoring indicators in
Annex 12): and (b) within three months of the review's completion  repare and begin to implement
an action plan based on the results of the review (see para. 6.1 o). The focus of the mid-term review
(see preliminary terms of reference in Annex 16) would be progress in classroom construction,
curriculum development, textbook production and distribution, the secondary education needs study,
the pilot computer education program, and development of evaluation and sector management
information systems. In addition, the review would cover progress made in the increases in
expenditures for basic education necessary for the implementation of the GPE (paras. 2.60 and 4.6).
3.54       The PCU would also be responsible for preparation of a project completion report which
would be forwarded to the Bank within six months of the date of project completion.
IV. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING. DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITS
A. Cost of the Project
4.1  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and excluding taxes, is
estimated at about US$61.5 million equivalent, of which about US$20.1 million of 33% would be
foreign exchange (Table 4.0).N  Investment costs amount to 88 percent and incremental recurrent
costs amount to 12 percent of base costs (Annex 11). Project costs were estimated at July 1991 price
levels and include physical contingencies of about 5% for civil works, equipment, furniture and
didactic materials. Price contingencies were calculated at 3.4% per year for 1991-96. These rates
have been applied to local and foreign costs as well, as periodic currency rate adjustments maintaining
32/ MEP is exempt from taxes and duties, so the only taxes in the project would be income taxes
resulting from teacher salary increases, estimated at US$400,000.



- 39 -
purchasing power parity are expected to compensate for the difference between projected US dollar
inflation and local inflation rates.
4.2         Estimated construction costs for the project area are based on unit prices derived from
current contracts and costs analyses for similar standards of construction in corresponding facilities.
Estimated rehabilitation costs are based on actual estimates done on a sample basis throughout the
country. Estimated costs of equipment and furniture are based on current c.i.f. unit prices, adjusted
to include local transportation costs. Estimates for technical assistance and studies are based on
current rates for local and foreign experts. Cost estimates for textbooks and instructional materials,
training, salaries and operating costs are based on current costs or costing standards used by MEP.
4.3        Incremental Recurrent Costs. During the implementation period, the project would add
an average of about US$1.5 million per year to the recurrent expenditures of MEP. Incremental
recurrent costs generated by the project are estimated in 1991 prices to grow from US$0.04 million in
1992 to US$3.6 million in 1996, the last year of project implementation. The estimated increase in
recurrent expenditures in 1996 due to the project (expressed in 1991 prices) would represent about
2% of MEP's recurrent budget for 1991. In view of (i) the high priority given to basic education in
the GPE and (ii) the project covenant providing for increased basic education expenditures (see para.
4.6), it is expected that these expenditures would be fully met. A large part of these recurrent costs
is to be financed by IDB and the Bank, and the Bank financing of the recurrent costs would be on a
declining basis (see para. 4.11).
4.4         Recurrent costs under the project, in July 1991 US dollars, are estimated as follows:
1992          1993           1994           1995           1996

.04           .17            1.0            2.5            3.6
These incremental recurrent costs would be generated mainly by salaries for 182 new teachers, salary
increases for some 44,000 teachers completing the two-year training program, and office and school
supplies.

(Financing % of total costs)    (100.0%)       (46%)    (37%)   (17%)
4.6        The proposed project would be co-financed by the Bank and IDB up to 83 percent of
total project costs, net of taxes and duties (which are negligible because all Government institutions
are exempt from Value-Added Tax and import duties). The proposed loan of US$23.0 million,
together with the IDB's loan of US$28.0 million, would finance 100 percent of foreign exchange
expenditures and 75 percent of local expenditures (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2).2' The Government
would finance about US$10.5 million. To ensure timely and efficient project implementation, various
start-up activities, including those related to technical and bidding specifications for civil works and
employment of consultants, are now being undertaken. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million
33/ Including earthquake reconstruction works estimated at US$2.4 million.
34/ The relatively high share of local cost financing would be necessary given the substantial
deterioration of Costa Rica's capacity to mobilize domestic resources. The Government's
stabilization program aimed at raising revenues and reducing local expenditures by adjusting the
fiscal accounts and implementing investment budgets. This situation was aggravated by the
collapse in the international coffee agreement in September 1989 and the rise in oil prices in the
second half of 1990. In addition, significant domestic public savings will be required for
rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the earthquake that hit
Costa Rica in April 1991 and floods that affected the country's Atlantic Region in July 1991. The
high share of local cost financing is also justified by the project's major emphasis on serving the
educational needs of the poorest segments of the population, and the difficult economic situation
of the country.

equivalent would be provided to help cover eligible start-up expenditures made on or after July 6,
1991, the date of the end of appraisal. To ensure adequate financing of the investment and
inicremental recurrent costs generated by the project and to prevent inequitable allocation of public
education resources between leve's of education (see para. 2.31), the Government would provide for
increases in basic education expenditures (grades 1-9, academic) during 1992-1996: in real absolute
terms, to not less than: 14.8 billion colones in 1992; 15.6 billion colones in 1993; 16.6 billion
colones in 1994; 16.6 billion colones in 1995; and 17.0 billion colones in 1996 (in May 31, 1991
prices); and as minimum percentages of total education spending, to: 51.0% in 1992; 52.5% in
1993; 53.3% in 1994; 54.4% in 1995; and 53.8% in 1996. Moreover, allocations for non-salary
costs for basic education as a percentage of total allocations for basic education would increase to at
least: 2.5% in (992; 3.9% in 1993; 4.9% in 1994; 4.7% in 1995; and 8.5% in 1996. During
negotiations. assurances were obtained that the Government would provide for these incremases in basic
education expenditures (grades 1-9. academic) during 1992-1996 in real absolute terms and as
minimum percentages of total education spendina (see para. 6.1 p). (See Annex 14, page 1 for a
calculation of these amounts).

C.   Procurement
4.7. Civil Works. Civil works include: (a) rehabilitation of existing dilapidated classrooms and
three regional administrative centers; (b) replacement of classrooms damaged in the t3rthquake of
April 22, 1991; and (c) construction of new classrooms, teacher houses and three regional
administrative centers. The total cost of civil works is estimated at US$26.8 million equivalent.
Procurement of these works would follow Bank guidelines and standard bidding documents would be
used. The bulk of these works would comprise a great number of small buildings scattered
throughout the country and in remote locations. Packaging of civil works contracts would be
encouraged, but due to the small amounts and scattered locations it is not expected that foreign
bidders would participate.
(a)   The cost of classroom rehabilitation to be executed by the MEP is expected to be, on
average, US$7,000 per classroom. Rehabilitation would include: school fiurniture repairs;
painting; lighting repairs; toilet installations; water and sewage installations and replacement of
windows, doors, floors, and roofs. (ziven the nature of these works their procurement through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) would not be



- 43 -
justified. Therefore, adaptation and rehabilitation contracts totaling US$7. 11 million and not
exceeding US$50,000 each would be awarded on the basis of three price quotations. In
addition, contracts for these works not exceeding US$15,000 each could be awarded through
direct contracting, up to an aggregate amount of US$3.5 million equivalent.
(b)  The cost for new classrooms, classroom replacement and teacher houses is expected to
be, on average, US$14,000 per unit. Procurement of civil works costing US$50,000 or less
would be done through local shopping, involving at least three price quotations, ane not
exceeding US$2.0 million in aggregate. In cases where various civil works could be grouped
together in packages costing more than US$50,000, such contracts would be awarded on the
basis of LCB procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Such packages are not expected to exceed
US$300,000 each. In the unexpected event that packaging allows civil works contracts greater
than US$1.5 million, ICB procedures acceptable to the Bank would be used. Total civil works
costs for new construction financed by the Bank are estimated at US$4.15 million.
(c)   The cost for the rehabilitation of 2 regional administrative centers and construction of 1
new regional administrative center is expected to average US$340,000 each, and corresponding
contracts would be awarded on the basis of LCB procedures satisfactory to the Bank up to an
aggregate amount of US$1.02 million.
4.8.       Goods and Materials. Goods and materials to be procured include school furniture,
computer equipment and accessories, textbooks, educational materials and equipment.
(a) Contracts for the procurement of school furniture, educational materials and equipment,
computers and accessories, would be awarded following ICB for all contracts valued above
US$200,000 equivalent. For contracts of goods and services valued between US$25,000 and
US$200,000 equivalent LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank would be used, up to an
aggregate amount of US$0.8 million. For contracts valued below US$25,000 equivalent,
shopping procedures, satisfactory to the Bank, would be followed up to an aggregate amount of
US$0.2 million. Bids from local manufacturers would be granted a 15% margin of preference
for purposes of bid evaluation under ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines.
(b) All textbooks and most educational materials are part of the Didactic Materials component
to be financed by the IDB. The only goods to be financed by the Bank would be short
anthologies (5-75 pages) and basic equipment (overhead projectors, desks, microcomputer,
printer, etc.) required for the Teacher Training component. The anthologies would cost on
average US$6 and would be produced in limited quantities, making ICB and LCB unsuitable.
Therefore contracts valued at US$25,000 or below for the printing of these materials would be
awarded on the basis of three price quotations up to an aggregate amount of US$250,000. The
equipment contracts valued at US$25,000 or below would also be awarded on the basis of
shopping procedures satisfactory to the Bank up to an aggregate amount of US$60,000.
4.9.       Technical Assistance. Consultants carrying out studies and technical assistance would be
hired following the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1991).
4.10.      MEP is preparing standard ICB and LCB documents for procurement of civil works and
goods, as well as for hiring of consultants, during project implementation. During negotiations, the



- 44 -
model bidding documents (see para. 6.1 a). Tender documents, bid evaluations and contract
documentation for all contracts awarded through: ICB; the first LCB for civil works: the first LCB
for goods and/or services (regardless of value); and all contracts for more than US$200,000
equivalent, would be reviewed by the Bank in advance. Activities not involving procurement include
financing of in-service training, l ,al salaries (including monetary incentives for teacher trainees),
evaluation and supervision and operational expenditures (excluding any schooi supplies) for up to an
aggregate amount of US$18.5 million equivalent. A summary of procurement arrangements is
provided in Table 4.3.

D.         Disbursements
4.11.      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed during a six year period (closing date:
December 31, 1997) as follows: (a) zivil works, 78 percent of expenditures for new construction and
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing educational facilities, and for repair and construction of
regional administrative offices; (b) equipment, furniture, and vehicles, 100 percent of foreign
expenditures and 85% of local expenditures, excluding taxes; (c) teacher and administrative staff
trainirg and training materials, 100 percent of total expenditures; (d) technical assistance, consultancy
services, and studies, 100% of total expenditures; and (e) incremental salaries, at a rate of 100% until
an aggregate amount of US$1.3 million has been reached, thereafter, disbursements for this category
would be made at a rate of 70 percent until the aggregate amount of US$2.5 million has been
reached; and the remainirg funds would be disbursed at a rate of 25 percent.
4.12.      Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed according to the implementation
schedule shown in Annex 12, page 1 against expenditures that would be submitted to the Bank and
fully documented for contracts valued at more than US$200,000 equivalent for goods and civil works.
Claims for expenditures of lesser amounts would be disbursed against presentation of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs), for which the supporting documentation would be retained by the MEP for
inspection by tie Bank and by external auditors. All expenditures, statements of expenditures and
disbursement documents would be tt ansmitted to the Bank through the PCU. The government would
set up a Special Account in U.S. dollars in Banco Central de Costa Rica with an initial deposit of
US$2.0 million. Withdrawals from the Special Account would be supported by the required
documentation at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of expenditure.
4.13.      The Government would also establish a separate project account in local currency in the
name of MEP in the Central Bank. During negotiations. the Government provided assurances that it
would maintain a separate project account in the Central Bank. with an initial deposit of US$0.3
million eauivalent and thereafter replenish the account every guarter, so that they would cover the
proiect expenditures to be incufred in the next six months (see para. 6.1 r!. Establishment of the
special account and the projct account. and an initial denosit in the project account of US$0.3
million. eQuivalent would be conditions for effectiveness (see para. 6.2 c).
E.         Accounting and Auditing
4.14.      The MEP would establish and maintain separate accounts and records for project
expenditures. The PCU would maintain a consolidated account of all expenditures under the project.
These accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. The audit
reports, which would include the audit of regional offices and a separate opinion on the adequacy of
statements of expenditures, would be forwarded to the Bank no later than six months after the end of
each fiscal year.

V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A.   Benefits
5.1        The project's primary aim is to improve the .  lty and efficiency of basic education,
not merely by the traditional mechanisms of curriculum revision, the provision of teacning/learning
materials, and staff development programs, but also by the change towards an more student-centered,
interactive educational process. While most of these benefits would accrue to the whole student
population in grades 1-9 (526,828 children), the main beneficiaries will be the students and parents
from disadvantaged rural areas (estimated at 273,340 students in grades 1-9) because: (i) the
infrastructure component is targeted specifically on schools attended by such students; (ii) educational
materials would be provided free or at minimum cost to the most needy families; (iii) the vast
majority of unqualified teachers who would receive training currently work in these areas; (iv)
distance education technologies would be designed and applied to benefit rural students; and (v) the
improved central and regional administration of schools should result in a fairer, more decentralized,
distribution of human and financial resources. In addition to student beneficiaries, 16,660 basic
education teachers (grades 1-9) will benefit from certification and upgrading programs, and 1,265
MEP administrative, technical and supervisory staff will benefit from training in curriculum
development, assessment, development of educational materials, and administration.
5.2        Together with these quality improvements should develop a rising level of internal
efficiency with improvements in student attrition and completion rates, as well as in performance
standards and employability. These advantages may be expected to flow not only from quality
improvements but also from the enhanced planning, administrative and evaluation potential built into
the project with its support for a strengthened MEP for the Government's decentralization program.
In short, these benefits should result in a more cost-effective, efficient, and high quality educational
service, enabling Costa Rica to regain its position of educational eminence in Latin America.
5.3        Finally, all types of basic education schools, from the one-classroom rural multigrade
through the urban and rural primary and secondary academic, are intended to benefit from such
innovative approaches as (i) the introduction of demonstration schools, illustrating the best examples
of educational practice, (ii) the extension of computer-assisted learning from the primary schools to
the secondary level, and (iii) decentralization and the closer interrelation of schools, family and
community, and the world of work.
5.4        Impact on Women. The progress achieved over the past decade in promoting more
equal opportunities for women in employment, and in salary levels, and in depicting a more
collaborative role for both sexes in domestic responsibilities, will be further enhanced by (i) ensuring
that the new school textbooks and teaching materials reflect and encourage a more balanced treatment
of women; 'and (ii) including in the revised school curricula special themes on family and community
life which will emphasize the mutual responsibilities at home, and the equal career rights of both
sexes.
5.5        Environmental Impact. Since with few exceptions physical infrastructure included in the
project relates to the replacement of, or minor extensions to existing schools, and since in all relevant
cases sanitary facilities and water supplies are being given special attention, it is unlikely that any
environmental damage will result from the project. More importantly over the long run, special



- 47 -
topics and projects on ecology are being introduced into all school curricula, raising all students'
awareness of environmental concerns.
B.   Risks
5.6         The principal project risks relate to: (a) the timely availability of counterpart funds; and
(b) the implementation capacity of the Government, in particular as affected by the pace of its
proposed decentralization program. With regard to (a), the proposal for the Bank and IDB to co-
finance a total of 83 percent of total project costs reduces the need for counterpart funds to about
US$10.5 million over the life of the project, thus making more likely the availability of Government
resources to meet the rising level of incremental costs engendered by the project. Establishment of a
project account for counterpart funding would also reduce the risk. Moreover, the condition (see
paras. 4.6 and 6.1 p) providing for increased basic education expenditures (in both absolute and
relative terms) and the strong support for the project already indicated by the Legislative Assembly
and the Executive Branch should ensure high priority for Government funding of the project. With
respect to (b), the Government's strategy to freeze a number of non-essential vacant posts and to
apply these vacancies to key appointments in the regions, together with existing legislation permitting
the redistribution of staff within regions and a policy of staff incentives, should resolve this issue.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6. 1       During negotiations the Government:
(a)   provided assurances that if IDB exercises its right, under the loan agreements signed
with the Government, to invoke legal remedies, the Bank will have the right to invoke
its legal remedies under the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee
Agreements (January 1, 1985) (see para. 3.2);
(b)  reviewed and reached agreement on an implementation plan for the teacher certification
and upgrading program for the first year of project implementation, as well as an
Agreement (Convenio) between MEP and the three universities (UCR, UNA, UNED)
offering certification programs (see para. 3.21);
(c)   agreed that implementation plans for each subsequent year of teacher training program
implementation would be discussed and agreed upon at each annual review meeting (see
para. 3.21);
(d)   provided assurances that it would be a condition of house allocation that any
underqualified teachers occupying school houses would enter into a formal agreement to
undergo the certification training course, preferably outside the teachers' working hours
(see para. 3.33);
(e)   provided evidence that with respect to new constructions programmed for the first year
of the project, the sites have been secured and are available for the initiation of activities
(see para. 3.35);



- 48 -

(j)   provided assurances that it would submit terms of reference for the secondary education
needs study by June 30, 1992, and that the results of this study would be made available
at the time of the mid-term project implementation review (see para. 3.42);
(k)   provided assurances that the preliminary results of the study on student achievements in
the schools with experimental computer-based classrooms, including an in-depth cost
analysis, would be ready for discussion at the mid-term review (see para. 3.44);
(I)   presented to and reached agreement with the Bank on, a proposal for the appointment of
thL I-CU Director, and on the structure and staffing plan for the PCU; assurances w -e

of reference by the Bank, a mid-term implementation review, no later than two and a
half years after project effectiveness, to analyze project implementation experience and
possible project impact (with a focus on the monitoring indicators in Annex 12); and
(b) within three months of the review's completion, prepare and begin to implement an
action plan based on the results of the review (see para. 3.53);

(grades .-9, academic) during 1992-1996 in real absolute terms and as minimum
percentages of total education spending (see para. 4.6);
(q)   presented to and reached agreement with the Bank on, prototype designs and model
bidding documents (see para. 4.10); and
(r)   provided assurances that it would maintain a separate project account in the Central
Bank, with an initial deposit of US$0.3 million equivalent and thereafter replenish the
account every quarter, so that they would cover the project expenditures to be incurred
in the next six months (see para. 4.13).
6.2        As conditions of loan effectiveness, the Government would:
(a)   provide evidence of the signing of the Loan Agreement between the Government and the
IDB (see para. 3.2);
(b)   provide evidence of the establishment and staffing of the PCU, satisfactory to the Bank
(see para. 3.49); and

Note: MEP enrollment projections for the primary level peak in 1996, requiring a total of 16,190
teachers. As shown in Annex 5, Table 2, currently MEP has 11,688 qualified teachers. Therefore,
if all needs are covered (i.e. 4,893 teachers are hired and trained by 1995) total supply will be
sufficient to cover total demand for all years 1991-1996. After 1996 enrollment projections show
an annual 1% decline in the number of teachers required, such that existent university teacher
training capacity will be sufficient to meet all needs after 1996.
MEP enrollment projections for the lower secondary level, however, continue to climb for the rest
of the decade, such that even with the training of teachers in years 1991-1995 as detailed above,
deficits will remain in years 1996-2000. Thus, the supply of secondary teachers will become a more
urgent issue than the supply of primary teachers by the end of the decade.
The proposed project would meet the entire deficit of training 16,420 teachers (2,928 aspirantes
for grades 1-6; 819 aspirantes for grades 7-9, and 673 autorizados for grades 7-9).
1/ Needs are based on MEP enrollment forecasts and a student-teacher ratio fo 35:1.
2/ Both needs and capacity at the lower secondary level take into account enrollment projections,
a student-teacher ratio of 35-1, and differentiates supply and demand by subject: math, spanish,
social studies, science and english.
2/ To this deficit must be added the 673 untrained and uncertified teachers working at the lower
secondary level (autorizados), for a total deficit of 1,492 lower secondary teachers.

COSTA RICA
BASIC EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS
1.    During project appraisal mission staff gathered the latest Ministry of Education (MEP)
appropriations and expenditure information from 1987 to 1991. Overall, the figures show increasing
total education spending in both nominal and real terms, while education spending as a portion of
GDP and the national budget has remained fairly constant (about 4.8% and 13%, respectively). An
encouraging trend is the increasing resource allocations being made to primary education. Serious
distortions remain, however, in the allocation of expenditures between lower and higher education.
2.    In real terms, education expenditures between 1987 - 1991 have continued to increase, despite
Costa Rica's difficult macroeconomic situation. Over the last five years real spending has increased
an average of 9% per year, primarily due to higher teacher salary costs. With increased salary
expenditure- 'tne structure of spending has changed; 99% of the MEP's budget now goes for recurrent
costs, while just 1% is for capital expenditures (down from 27% in 1980).

have dominated, averaging 38% and 36%,          0                             . .
respectively, over the five-year period                y5 a.

with little fluctuation, while secondary       Figure 1: Ministry of Education Expenditures by
technical spending hovered between 6-7%.       Sub-Sector, 1987-1991
Lastly, pre-school expenditures accounted
for just 3.5 - 4.0% over the five-year period, but rose steadily on an annual basis (see Figure 1).

4.    Comparing per stue!ent spending, higher
education continues to receive privileged             REAL PER STUDENT EXPENDITURES
treatment in Costa Rica. While constituting just                 - _ 
11 % of total enrollment, higher education         _
accounts for about 34% of total education            .
expenditures. Conversely, primary education,
which represents about 61 % of total enrollment,    I   .
accou-ts for less than 40% of expenditures in
1991. Higher education unit costs are about
eight times higher than those for primary abu
education, and appropriations continue to be                 _
guaranteed by virtue of a Constitutional
earmarking of certain government revenues (see
Figure 2).

5.    The trends in MEP spending, on the              MEP EXPEND!TUQE5 BY SUBSECTOR
other hand, provide some reason for optimism.
As Figure 3 shows, university expenditures as a
percentage of total education spending have
declined from almost 39% in 1987 to 33.5% in
1991. Meanwhile, primary education spending
has been the mirror image of university
expenditures, increasing from 36% of total
education spending in 1987 to almost 40%
today. As a percentage of GDP, primary               ___
education spending increased 21% between              _. 
1987 to 1990 (from 1.5% to 1.82%), while         a                V7 -,
university spending decreased 6% over the same

time period (from 1.61 % to 1.51 %).                1987 - 1991
6.     Clearly, more resources are required at
the primary education level. This could be
achieved through a different distribution of public resources for the sector rather than from additional
resources. Recent policy changes at the higher education level (raising public tuition fees 85% and
increasing pressure from the Ministry of Finance for cost-recovery through the sale of university
services) are signs of change, although public support and the Constitutional provisions for higher
education financing remain strong.

7.    By region, MEP's sDending over the last five years appears reasonable, at least in terms of
the allocations made by the Ministry to the School Associations (Juntas de Educacion). As Table
13.0 shows, regions which have relatively favorable socio-economic conditions (e.g. San Jose) have
received less money on a per student basis than have regions with relatively unfavorable socio-
economic conditions (e.g. San Carlos, Coto and Canas). This suggests efforts to redress urban-rural
inequalities, although it is indisputable that urban schools in general are better-equipped and better-
staffed than rural schools.

8.    The issues raised above regarding (a the high recurrent cost component in MEP's budget and
(b) excessive university expenditures suggest a critical indicator of education financing: non-salary
expenditures for basic education (Gr. 1-9). Table 1.1 on the next page provides line-by-line budget
breakdown of these expenditures, dem,onstrating that for the 1991 budget cycle non-salary
expenditures make up just 2.8% of MEP's total budget including universities, and just over 4.0% of
MEP's budget excluding universities. Moreover, as Figure 4 shows, the percentage of MEP's budget
allocated to non-salary basic education has been declining over the past five years, particularly in
terms of MEP's total spending.
9.    World Bank staff members have
hel'I repeated meetings with Costa Rican        NON-SALARY BASIC EDUCATiON EXPENDITJRES
authorities concerning the need to increase
this area of expenditures, especially in light  ,: -
of the increased material, equipment and
maintenance costs generated by the Basic        4.                   \
Education project. As a budgetary target,         4\
MEP should attempt to raise this area of
expenditures to at least 8.5% of its budget
by the end of the project, which would
represent a doubling of non-salary basic
education expenditures in real terms (see       .._._                            _

The mid-term review would focus on (a) overall education sector issues which may affect
the achievement of project objectives; (b) progress in improving the quality of basic education
(project output objective.j; and (c) implementation of specific project components (project input
objectives). Progress in all three of these areas would be discussed, the cause of any shortfalls
analyzed, and corrective actions and/or revised goals agreed upon. The mid-term review would
take place approximately two and a half years from the date of project effectiveness. This date is
currently estimated to be August 1, 1994. Approximately three months before this review the
Government would prepare a short report summarizing progress in achieving project goals. No
later than three months after the review the Government would initiate an action plan for
improved project implementaticn (agreed with the Bank) based on the results of the review.
Sectoral and Related Issues
(a) Extent to which expenditures on basic education have increased in real terms
and as a percentage of total education expenditures, and expenditures on non-salary
items have increased, as specified in the draft loan agreement. Reasons for any
shortfall in these objectives.
(b) Progress with regard to educational decentralization, including (i) review of how
government's overall decentralization program is affecting educational
decentralization; (ii) extent to which decision making has been decentralized; and (iii)

Specific Issues to be Reviewed
2.   The following specific issues would be reviewed:
(a) The extent to which the current structure of third cycle basic education and of
diversified secondary education (academic, commercial, agricultural, and technical
schools) is adequately serving Costa Rica's needs for human resource development,
and how this structure and the related curriculum should be changed to meet those
needs;
(b) the extent to which the quality of secondary education is adequate in terms of
student learning, and the most cost-effective combination of inputs (teacher and
director training, educational materials, computers, curriculum change, student
teacher ratios, etc.) needed to improve quality.
(c) whether the current system of managing, organizing and financing the secondary
system is adequate, and how financing and management should be changed to meet
future needs, including to what extent decision making should be decentralized to
individual schools and directors;
(d) the extent to which access to secondary education should be expanded, including
how underprivileged groups can better be served;
(e) the current and long term role of private secondary education and the
appropriate relationships between the public and private sectors; and

Study on the Secondary School Computer Program
1. Objectives:
To evaluate the secondary school computer program in its elements, operation, and impact on
the students' academic performance as well as on teachers' attitudes.
2. Methodology:
Key indicators should be measured at the 20 participating high schools and compared with
results obtained at 20 non-participating high schools. Based on the initial results on academic
performance, students must be distributed into stratified groups. Participating students' scores
should be compared with non-participating students' scores (control group). Other aspects must
be assessed based on the respective samples.
3. Evaluation Aspects:
3.1 - Evaluation of Technical and Economic Feasibility
An impact evaluation of the computer program should be carried out on the following
indicators:
a)   Standardized tests in Spanish, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies, at the beginning
and at the end of the year;
b)   dropout and retention rates per year;
c)   terminal efficiency of the Third Cycle (7-9 grades);
d)   students' absenteeism rates;
e)   average daily number of students who use the computer (to estimate unit costs);
f)  teachers' attitudes, receptivity and actions undertaken toward technology;
g)   reactions and relations displayed toward the computer program by the education
community, parents and the economic and labor force;

h)   unexpected quantitative and qualitative results;
i)   comparison of the computer program costs with: (i) the savings of public resources
obtained through possibly diminishing repetition and dropout rates;
(ii) the economic benefit (salary differential) stemming from a higher graduation rate.
3.2 - Evaluation of Financial Feasibility
The use of the high school computer science program by the community should be evaluated,
as well as the percentage of operation recovering costs, and the mechanisms employed to
guarantee such cost recovery.
3.3 - Evaluation of Administrative Feasibility
A study should be conducted on the computers' durability, on the security and maintenance
problems entailed, salary and other costs of the center managers, needs for classroom preparation,
acquisition of accessories and materials etc.

COSTA RICA
BASIC EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Student Evaluation and Testine
1. Previous Experience
There has been some experience in implementing educational tests in Costa Rica. In 1986 and
1987 Costa Rica assessed the universe of third, sixth and ninth graders. However, the program
lacked a clearly articulated goal, and did not include the objective of using tests results as a direct
tool to improve clasrroom practice. As a consequence, feedback to schools and teachers was
minimal. Based on the lessons learned from this experience, the Ministry of Public Education-
MEP decided to build, as part of the present project, an achievement evaluation designed to
monitor and assess the quality of education and to identify cost-effective means to improve basic
education.
2. Technical Features
A readiness test will be applied to a sample of 10 percent of all incoming first graders.
Criterion-referenced tusts in Spanish, mathematics, science and social studies will be developed
and applied to stratified samples of near 10 percent of third and ninth graders. Finally, norm-
referenced tests will be applied to all sixth graders for accreditation purpose.
The objectives of the cognitive tests (3, 6 and 9 grades) will be based on curriculum contents
and developed on the basis of the official study programs upon nationwide consultation with
teachers. At least three measures of reliability will be used to assure the quality of the items.
Standard questions identifying school and family background will be included to allow further
academic and socioeconomic analysis.
One of the most valuable lessons from the local experience with assessment implementation
relates to the relevance of security problems in test editing, printing, and application.
Administrative procedures will be carefully designed to guarantee that previous shortcomings will
be amended.
The dissemination of the evaluation results will play a fundamental role. To this end, a careful
analysis will be conducted to decide what information to report and to whom, as well as the
timing, breakdown of results, and pedagogical analysis. So far it has been established that
decision-makers and professionals at the central level, regional and local authorities and teachers
will be the main recipients of the information. Feedback information would also de provided to
teacher training and curriculum development units in MEP and its regional centers in order to
influence curriculum and textbook development, teacher training programs and, finally, to improve
teacher performance in the classroom.



- 109 -
ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 2
3. Managing the System
MEP will contract the Costarican Instituto de Investigaciones para el Mejoramiento de la
Educacidn-IIMEC to develop the achievement tests and the statistical analysis, as well as the
procedures for packaging, distributing and test aplication. At the same time, MEP will develop a
small unit (School Evaluation Unit) which by the end of the project would assume greater
responsibility in student testing and evaluation.
The first assessment, under the IIMEC leadership, will take place in 1992, covering the
accreditation exams for all sixth graders. The following year all three types of tests will be applied.
Starting in 1995 MEP will play a more important role in implementing the accreditation exams for
sixth graders, and f.om 1996 on it is expected that it will coordinate the whole system. At this
pont in time, three MEP staff should have been trained in evaluation techniques at the
Universidad del Valle, in Guatemala, to improve their theoretical and practical knolwdege and
skills in this area, and IIMEC should have transferred some know-how to MEP.
4. Sustainability
Institutional and technical sustainability of the system would be assured, since IIMEC has the
human resources and the technical capacity to start and implement the system. The trasfer of
technonology to MEP has been designed in an gradual way, so that initially four MEP staff will be
closely associated with IIMEC to be trained during the first three yearr of the implementation
process. At the same time the three School Evaluation Unit staff members will be receiving
specialized trainng at the Universidad del Valle. In the fourth year of the project MEP will start
implementing the accreditation tests and next will start applying the remaining tests. This strategy
would be evaluated during implementation and, if deemed appropriate, MEP would assume more
and more responsibility; otherwise the IIMEC alternative would be thoroughly maintained.
