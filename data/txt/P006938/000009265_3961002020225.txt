MEMGRANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTIORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLC OF
CO   RECA FOR A BASIC EDUCATON RHABILTATN  OECQT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendatlou on a pr&posed loan to the Republic of Costa Rica for
US$23.0 million equivalent is submitted for your approval. The proposed loan would be repayab;e over 17
years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bask's variable interest rate and charges. The project would be
cofianced by the Inter-American Development Bank (.JB) for US$28.0 million equivalent. The Government
of Costa Rica (GOCR) would be the Borrower, and the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) would be the
executing agency
2.  ftckgIou. By 1980 Costa Rica had reached a relatively advanced stage of social development.
Indicators such as literacy rates, infant mortlity, life expectancy and the provision of health services ranked
the country in a position of eminence among Latin American nations. Decades of continuous progress,
culminating in the accelerated pace of economic growth in the period 1969-1979, brought about a substantial
reduction of poverty and improved standards of living. The decade of the 1980s, however, witnessed the
onset of a profound and lasting economic crisis, with a resultant sharp recession, negative growth rates in the
economy, and high inflation. As the crisis deepened, the level and pattern of education expenditures changed:
between 1980 and 1988 education spending fell 25 percent in real terms; combined with sharp increases in
enrollment this translated into per primary (grades 1-6) student expenditure cuts of over 32 percent over the
same period. Within the sector, basic (grades 1-9) academic education spending as a percent of total education
spending declined from 63 percent in 1980 to 51 perceiit in 1988. Despite a limited improvement in recent
years, the education sector has never regained its 1980 level and distribution of funding.
3. Spending cutbacks, combined with a population growth rate of 2.5 percent per annum and the
concomitant increased demand for education, resulted in a marked decline in the quality and efficiency of
education, characterized by shortages of qualified teachers and textbooks, diapidated school fcilities, outdated
ricula, increased repetiton and drop-out rates, poor student performance and lowered progression and
completion indices, particularly in the rural and marginal urban areas. The situation has been fiuther
exacerbated by weakneses in educational planning and administion, within an overly centralized structure,
resulting in Inadequate shool supervision, insufficient a ent of student achievement and an inequitable
distribution of human and financial resources. Finally, while basic and secondary education suffered,
disproportionately high allocaions continued to be made to higher education, in accordance with constitutional
requirements.
4.   The Government's General Plan for Education 1990-94 accords highest priority to improving the
quality, efficiency, and relevance of education, particularly at the basic level (rades 1-9) and in the
disadvantaged rural ad marginal urban areas. Its major objective is to reduce the incidence of repetition and
drop-out, to increase student promotion and completion rates, and to improve student achievement levels. To
this effect Government strategy calls for: (i) increased resources for basic education; (ii) improved educational
seces, including the introduction of new curricula (mcorporating environmental and family life aspects),
in-service teacher education programs, the provision of textbooks and other educational materials,
infrastructure improvements and a permanent schools maintace service; (iii) the rationalization and
improvement of secondary technical education; (iv) new metodological approaches in secondary academic
education including the introduction of computer-assisted learning; and (v) an effective decatalized system
of sector planning and administration, with special emphasis on educational assessment. I addition, the
Govement wil carry out an in-depth study to assess the present status of secondary education as a whole,
and determine policies and means for improving the quality and efficiency of secondary education, including
both technical and academic.

5.   Rationale fr Bank Inolvement. Bank support in improving educational quality and efficiency is an
integral part of its country assistance strategy, aimed at supporting Costa Vica's stabilization and structural
reform efforts to create conditions for economic recovery and growth, while minimizing tle social cost of
adjustment. More zelevant and high quality basic education programs would be a major factor in developing
human resources and providing trained and trainable manpower to meet the country's changing economic and
labor market needs, in particular those of the non-traditional export sector. In addition, Bank support for
retabilitated and cost-effective basic education would help the Government's fiscal adjustment efforts by
improving efficiency in public sector resource allocation and use. Also, as the Chairman of the Consultative
Group for Costa Rica, the Bank has been instrumental in mobilizing external aid funds on soft terms that are
needed for the educational sector reform. IDB cofinancing of the proposed project is expected.
6.   The Bank has had only one human resources sector operation in Costa Rica, which was signed ip 1973,
and implemented satisfactorily. Principal lessons learned from that and other LAC regional loans for
education include: (i) the importance of avoiding complex projects involving multiple implementation agencies;
(ii) the advisability of using existing institutional capacity to the greatest extent possible, suitably reinforced,
to promote institution-building; and (iii) the need to carefully monitor project implementation schedules and
prepare annual work plans and budgets. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the proposed
project.
7.   Proiect Obiectives. The project's main objective is to improve the quality and efficiency of basic
academic education (grades 1-9), especially in disadvantaged rural and marginal urban areas, by providing the
necessary educational inputs and support services to raise the level of student achievement and reduce the
incidence of repetition and dropout, and by strengthening the Ministry of Education's capacity to plan and
administer efficiently and equitably a decentralized education system. Additionally, it would assist the
aovernment to upgrade the quality and effectiveness of its secondary education program by an in-depth study
of the subsector, and through a pilot program in computer-assisted learning.
8.   Proect Desgiptg  The project consists of three main components: (1) Improvements in the Quality
gBasic Educaton (83 percent of total project costs, including contingencies), which would include: (a)
curriculum revision; (b) the production and distribution of student textbooks, workbooks, teaching manuals
and classroom educational materials, including school libraries; (c) an institutionalized in-sevice training
program for teachers and administrators; and (d) improvements in physical infrastructure and fhcilities in the
country's most disadvantaged rural and marginal urban regions, including schools damaged by the earthquake
of April 22, 1991; (2) Strengthening of Sector Planning and Management (14 percent of total project costs),
which would: strengthen the planning and administrative capacity of MEP, specifically in the areas of
personnel management, financial and budgetary control, and educational planning, at the central level and,
in support of the Government's decentralization policies, at regional levels by (a) the provision of computers
and related equipment, and staff development programs; (b) the installation of an effective Management
Information System fcr the collecdon and processing of educational data; and (c) the development of an
institutionalized student achievement testing and evaluation service; and (3) Improvement in the Quality of
Secondary Education (3 percent of total project costs), which would include: (a) an in-depth study of the
present status and needs of secondary education to b> conducted by MEP and (b) a two-phase pilot program
of computer-assisted education in a total of 20 secondary academic schools, with the provision of
microcomputers, curriculum revision and teacher/administrator training.
9.   The total project cost, net of taxes, is esfimated at US$61.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$20.1 million (33 percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are



3
shown L Schedule B. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million would be provided for expenditres
incurred after July 6, 1991. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Costa Rica are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9893-
CR, dated October 18, 1991 is also attached.
10. The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed over six years. The project would be implemented
through the existing organizational stucture of MEP. Overall authority for project management would be
vested in the Vice Minister of Education, assisted by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), responsible for
coordinating implementation functions (work plans, coordination among agencies, procurement, accounting,
monitoring and evaluation).
11.  Acio  Agre. The following were agreed upon durine negotiations: (a) an implementation plan for
the teacher certification and upgrading program for the first year of project implementation, as well as an
Agreemenit betweten MEP and the three universities (UCR, UNA, UNED) offering certification programs, and
assurances that teacher training program implementation plans for subsequent years would be agreed upon at
each annual review meeting; (b) assurances that terms of reference for a study on the utilization of school time
would be furnished by June 30, 1992 and the study conducted by June 30, 1993, with an action plan on the
basis of its recommendations prepared by September 30, 1993, and carried out thereafter; (c) the types and
timing of student testing and evaluation activities; (d) terms of reference for the secondary education study
would be submitted by June 30, 1992, with results of this study to be made available at the time of the mid-
term project implementation review; (e) preliminary results of the study on student achievements in the schools
with experimental computer-based classrooms, including an in-depth cost analysis, would be ready for
discussion at the mid-term review; (f) monitoring and evaluation indicators; (g) submission of annual project
implementation reports, consolidated work plans and budgets for each fiscal year, and an annual project
implementaion review by September 30 of each year; (h) the MEP would conduct a mid-term implementation
review to analyze project implementation experience and possible project impact, focusing, inter alia, on
progress in classroom construction, curriculum development, textbook production and distribution, the
secondary education needs study, the pilot computer education program, development of evaluation and sector
management information systems, and the increases in expenditures for basic education; and prepare and
implement an action plan based on the results of the review; (i) assurances that increases in basic education
expenditures (grades 1-9, academic) to agreed real absolute amounts and to minimum percentages of total
education spending, for each of the project implementation years, would be effected; and 0) prototype designs
and model bidding documents.
12.  As ditions of loan effectiveness, the Government would provide evidence of: (a) the signing of the
loan agreement between the Government and IDB; (b) the establishment and staffing of the PCU; and (c) the
creation of the special account as well as of a project account for the deposit of counterpart funds; and (d) an
initial deposit in the project accounts of US$0.3 million equivalent.
13.  Conditin fr loan disbursement (a) against expenditures for the construction/equipment of regional
offices would be that: (i) the MEP Decree has been published giving effect to the regionalization and
decentralization of the education sector as provided for by the Public Sector Reform legislation; (-d) the
attributes and authority of the Regional Centers have been clearly established; and (Iii) key staff for each of
the six regional offices have been appointed; (b) against expenditures for teacher training programs to be
carried out by universities other than UCR, UNA and UNED would be the submission of evidence that each
such university has the capacity to carry out such programs and has entered into an agreement with MEP for
such purpose; and (c) against expenditures incurred in the secondary schools computer based education



4
component would be receipt of terms of reference for the evaluation of the proposed computer-assisted
learming program, the implementation plan, and an evaluation study of the primary school computer project.
14.   M ectBenefits.e project would support the Government's priority programs to improve the quality
and efficiency of basic educatioil through an effective decentralized education service. The improved student
flows and higher level of achievement would enhance efficiency in the use of public sector resources. The
special emphasis given to the increase in educational expenditcres for primary education will also help redress
the imbalances in the allocation of public sector resources between different levels of education, directing more
resources to high-yielding primary education. Improved student retention and completion rates. and higher
levels of student achievement will in general berefit all student:,; however, the main focus will be on the most
disadvantaged rural and marginal urban populations, addressing the needs of poorer groups in society. Family
life and the role of women in the home and at work will receive special attention in curriculum development
and textbooks. Half the beneficiary children of this protect will be girls; therefore, the project can be expected
to have positive effects on fertility levsls, the health status ani educational attainment of future generations.
15.  RIiM. Principal project risks relate to: (a) the timely availability of counterpart funds; and (b) the
implementation capacity of the Govermnent, in particular as affected by the pace of the proposed
decentralization program. With regard to (a), the total external financing by IDB and IBRI) at 83% of total
project costs reduces the needi foi counterpart funding to about US$10 5 million over the life of the project,
thus easing the government fiscal burden. Establishment of the project account would help mitigate the risk.
Moreover the strong support for the project already evinced by the Government should ensure high priority
for funding of the project and of the recurrent expenditures engendered by it. In regard to (b), the
Government's strategy to freeze a number of non-essential central administrative positions and apply these
vacancies to key appointments in the regions, together with existing legislation permitting the redistribution
of staff within regions and a policy of staff incentives, should resolve this issue.
16.  Recommendations I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply wth the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loans.
