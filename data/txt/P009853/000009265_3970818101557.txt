RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
OAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                India, acting by its President
Beneficiary:             National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPC)
Amount:                  US$250 million.
Terms:                   Repayment over 20 years, including five years
grace, at the applicable rate of interest.
Onlending Terms:         From the Government of India (GOI) to NTPC,
with repayment over 20 years, including five years'
grace, at an interest rate of not less than 12.52
per annum.   GOI would bear the foreign exchange
and interest risks.
Project Description:    The Project's main objective is to help meet the
demand for electricity in the Northern Region of
India by providing transmission linkage between
the thermal power plants at Singrauli-Riband in
the State of Uttar Pradesh and the main load
centers in the Northern Region, and to ensure the
evacuation of pover from these plants at least
cost to the economy. The Project comprises the
installation of about 910 km of 500-kV direct
current (DC) power transmission line between
Rihand and Delhi, and the associated converting
stations, together with about 1,450 km of 400-kV
alternating current (AC) lines connecting
Singrauli-Rihand with the main load centers at
Kanpur, Delhi, Panipat and Jaipur and related
substations in the Northern Region. The Project
will introduce long-distance high-voltage direct
current (HVDC) power transmission technology in
India. There are no risks other than those nor-
mally associaLed with this type of Project. NTPC
will be assisted by consultants for implementation
of the DC component. NTPC has gained experience
with transmission and installation so risk of
slippage wiLl be minimal. Most of the major
equipment components with the exception
of the converting stations, are manufactured in
India, and there is zdequate understanding of, and
experience with their installation.

RIHAND POUER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
Comercial Energy Resources
1.01    India's commerciaLly exploitable energy resources consist of coal,
oil, gas, hydro, uranium, and thorium. Of the nonrenewable resources, coal
is the most abundant. Reserves of thermal coal have been estimated at
slightly more than 100 billion tons, of which 25 billion tons are proven.
Although reserves are ample, the quality of coal produced is generally low
and is deteriorating. Proven and probable petroleum reserves comprise
approximately 530 million tons of oil and 390 million toe of natural gas.
Despite recent increases in domestic production, India still imports 35% of
its oil requirements, which in 1983/84 cost the equivalent of 40Z of its
merchandise exports. Consequently, the Government of India (GOI) has
attempted to stimulate exploration while restricting petroleum and natural
gas consumption by emphasizing premium uses such as transportation,
petrochemicals and fertilizer. However, in the case of natural gas, the slow
development of premium uses has led to substantial volumes of associated gas
being flared. India's hydroelectric potential is about 100,000 MW. At
present, only 13,000 KW have been developed, 4,700 "s4 are under construction,
and a further 23,000 KW are being studied for future development. The
prominent role of hydro in regional least-cost development plans prepared in
1982 has led COI to emphasize the need to accelerate its development;
however, progress has been slow owing to the limited resources available for
the simultaneous preparation of a large number of schemes and the time
required to resolve water rights and environmental issues. The country's
uranium reserves could support a modest nuclear program (8,000-10,000 MW),
and its thorium reserves are enough for a large fast breeder program.
1.02    Planning the best use of India's indigenous energy resources for
power generation raises a number of issues. First, the high ash content of
coal, which can reach 50%, increases transport costs,  s well as power sta-
tion capital and operating costs. The development of minemouth stations,
which is constrained by pollution limitations and the availability of cooling
water, helps to solve only the transport problem, and thus priority needs to
be given to more selective mining and improved coal preparation. Even though
a lower ash content might help to alleviate transport problems, they would
still persist. Two studies included in the Dudhichua Coal Project (Loan
2393-IN) are designed to help formulate a strategy to deal with these
problems: one study will examine ways of improving the linkages between the
sources of supply and demand, and the other will concentrate on improvments
in handling and transportation facilities. Second, with the recent increases
in the supplies of both associated and free gas, there is a need for a



-2-
coherent policy on the utilization of gas. A Bank study planned for 1985
will focus on, among other things, the potential for the economic use of gas
in power generation. Third, if hydro development is to accelerate, further
resources, including consultants if necessary, need to be deployed to prepare
hydro schemes.  Furthermore, if water rights and environmental issues cannot
be resolved quickLy, appropriate procedures need to be initiated to ensure
that an adequate number of schemes are available for development.
Supply and Demand of Electricity - India
1.03    Approximately 5OZ of India's electricity is generated from coal, 40%
from hydro, and the rest from oil, nuclear power, and natural gas. Although
a number of large thermal projects are planned for the short term, the share
of hydro is expected to increase in the long run. Electricity losses have
risen slowly but steadily over the last few years and now exceed 26% of gross
generation. The deteriorating quality of coal has been at least partly
responsible for this trend, with coal stations' own consumption now approach-
ing 10% of gross generation against a desirable 5% or 6%. Distribution
networks have been overloaded because inadequate attention has been given to
systematic analysis and planning of this part of the system. As a result,
distribution losses are high by generally accepted standards and, although
they are lower than in several countries in the region, they need to be
reduced. Under its lending program, the Bank has supported pilot studies to
reduce system losses, and it will continue to follow this approach in its
future lending. However the Bank can only pursue this on a State-by-State
basis, with loss reduction targets reflecting the particular circumstances of
each State.
1.04    Over the past two decades, the consumption of electricity has grown
approximately twice as fast as total comercial energy consumption and now
accounts for more than 30% of the latter. As a result, shortages have
prevailed throughout the country and, during the last five years, averaged an
estimated 13% of electricity requirements. The principal sectoral shares of
total electricity consumption are: industrial, 56%; agricultural, 19X; and
domestic, 12% (Annex 1.1). Agriculture's share has grown steadily owing to
increased electrical irrigation pumping made possible by rural electrifica-
tion and encouraged by heavy subsidies. Total consumption has grown at an
average rate of 10X per annum during the past two decades, and the Central
Electricity Authority (CEA) has forecast growth of 9% per annum between
1984/85 and 1989/90 (Annex 1.2). Whether such growth can take place will
depend on the utilities' success in installing new capacity.
Organization of the Power Subsector
1.05    Responsibility for the suppLy of electricity is shared between the
Central and State Governments. The State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and the
Regional Electricity Boards (REBs) are controlled by States; the Central
Electricity Authority, the NationaL Thermal Power Corporation, the National



-3-
Hydro-Electric Power Corporation (NHPC), and the Rural Electrification Cor-
poration fEEC) are controlled by the Central Government. SEBs were
instituted under the Electricity Supply Act of 1948 (the Act) to promote the
development of the power subsector and to regulate private licensees.
Although, in principle, SEBs are supposed to be autonomous in managing their
day-to-day operations, in practice they are under the control of State
Governments in such matters as capital investment, tariffs, borrowings, pay,
and personnel policies. As a first step toward national integration, the
SEBs have been grouped into five regional systems, each coordinated by an
REB. Coordination responsibilities include overhaul and maintenance programs
and determination of generation schedules, inter-State power transfers, and
concomitant tariffs. CEA was created in 1950 to develop national power
policy and to coordinate the various agencies involved in supplying elec-
tricity. It is responsible for the formulation of countrywide investment
plans for approval by the Central Government, the development of integrated
system operation, the training of personnel, and research and development.
It maintains operational, economic, and financial data at both the Central
and State levels, and provides consulting support to SEBs. NTPC and NHPC
were incorporated in 1975 by GOI to construct and operate large power sta-
tions and associated transmission facilities. They sell bulk power to the
SEBs for distribution. NTPC has had marked success and has grown rapidly.
In contrast, NHPC is still struggling to establish a role for itself. The
States own most hydro sites and are reluctant to relinquish these sources of
comparatively inexpensive energy to the Central Government. REC was estab-
lished in 1969 to coordinate rural electrification and provide financial and
technical expertise for SEB schemes. At present, REC finances more than half
of total rural electrification investment.
Pricing and Resource Mobilization
1.06    Through the 1983 amendments to the Act, GOI has set a financial
objective for the SEBs to produce an annual return of at least 3% on their
historically valued net fixed assets, after meeting operating expenses,
taxes, depreciation and interest. The 3% return would represent in terms of
the Bank's conventional method of calculation, a rate of return on histori-
cally valued assets in the range of 102 to 13%. The Bank considers this
objective to be a reasonable minimum but believes that because of their
investment requirements a number of SEBs, needs to achieve internal cash
generation which implies returns higher than this minimum. Higher returns
may be possible in some cases through reclassification of consumers.
However, substantial improvements are only achievable through tariff
increases. Present tariffs are in most cases inadequate not only in economic
but also in financial terms, and most SEBs are unable to finance a reasonable
share of their investment programs. On average, SEB tariffs are equivalent
to only about 50% of long run marginaL cost (LRMC), in contrast NTPC's tariff
approximates LRMC. Industrial tariffs are almost 90% of LRMC but agricul-
tural and domestic tariffs, which are considered politically sensitive and
have been consistently subsidized, are only 27% and 36X, respectively.



-4-
State-specific financial programs are needed to provide both an increased
return on investment and simpler, efficient and affordable tariff structure.
These programs will be addressed through Bank's lending to individual SES's.
Power Subsector Planning
1.07    Because the demand for electricity has increased rapidly, COI at
present allocates about 20Z of public investment to power development. To
ensure that the subsector would be developed in the most economic manner, the
Bank encouraged GOI to prepare a comprehensive least-cost National Power Plan
(NPP), which was completed in September 1982. Although this plan represents
substantial progress, further refinement is needed. To assist GOI in this
task, the Bank has planned a study for FY85 that will review the assumptions
and methodology employed in formulating the least-cost plan. There appears
to be a need for further national integration and greater coordination
between power and other sectors, especially coal and gas. Since it will not
be possible to achieve full national integration immediately, the Bank will
continue to ensure that each Bank-financed project forms a part of an
up-to-date regional least-cost development plan. In due course, the sources
of supply considered in the formulation of each regional least-cost plan
should be widened to include the option of importing from neighboring
regions. This approach would eventually lead to integrated planning at a
national level. A further problem has arisen in the coordination of the
long-term NPP with the national five-year plan and shorter-term budgets.
Because of inadequate resources, fewer projects have been included in the
five-year plan than in the NPP and, as a resuLt of underestimation of project
costs and delays in project implementation, still fewer have been executed.
Consequently, the shortage of power has become more and more acute, and over
the next decade, India expects its power deficit to increase severalfold.
This deficit will tend to undermine rational planning because emphasis is
likely to be placed on rapid expansion of supply rather than on least-cost
development. Furthermore, it may prompt overinvestment in captive plant and
excessive use of high-value energy products in the generation of power. In
addition to supporting GOI's efforts to increase the supply, the Bank will
continue to stress to GOI the role of pricing in eliminating the deficit and
the importance of integrating planning and pricing.
Management and Operations
1.08    SEBs' organization and management practices have become outmoded as
supply has expanded. The quality of service, reLiability, and financial
performance are the principaL areas of concern. In general, SEBs have
high-quality engineering staff, but lack experienced personnel in the areas
of financial planning and control. The relatively poor status and pay of
these personnel compared with those in the private sector makes it difficult
to recruit competent staff. At present, accounts are maintained principally
to track cash receipts and expenditure , and accounting information is seldom
used for managerial purposes.  GOI has decided that a new and uniform



-5-
accounting system should be installed in all SEBs. After initial delays,
preparations are now proceeding and implementation was expected to begin in
April 1985.
1.09    In the area of operations, one of the main concerns has been the poor
performance of thermal plant. Factors that have contributed to this are
inadequate maintenance (due to capacity shortages), deficiencies in plant
manufacture, lack of spares, and the poor quality of coal; in general, these
problems have been recognized by the relevant authorities and corrective
steps are being taken. GOI is currently preparing a rehabilitation program
for thermal plant which may be financed by the Bank. Until this program is
compiled, the Bank will, whenever appropriate, include a thermal rehabilita-
tion component under each of the loans made to the SEBs. NTPC, the
beneficiary of the proposed Project, only operates new and well maintained
plants not requiring rehabiLitation.
Bank Group Participation in the Past
1.10    The Bank has made 18 loans for Indian power projects amounting to
US$1,983 million, and 17 IDA credits totaling US$2,409 million. Seventeen
projects financed under the following loans and credits have been completed:
ten generating projects, the Beas Project (Credit 98-IN), the first four
transmission projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN, 377-IN and 604-IN), and
the First and Second Rural Electrification Projects (Credits 572-IN and
911-IN). The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) was completed in
1983, and the Second Rural Electrification Project in 1984. The Singrauli
(Credit 685-IN), Korba (Credit 793-IN), and Ramagundam (Credit 874-IN and
Loan 1648-IN) Thermal Power Projects are in advanced stages of implementa-
tion. The credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project (Credit
1027-IN) and the creditiloan for the first stage of the Farakka Thermal Power
Project (Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN) were approved in May and June 1980.
Korba II (Credit 1172-IN) was approved in July 1981, Ramagundam II (Loan
2076-IN) in December 1981, and the Third Rural Electrification Project (Loan
2165-IN) in June 1982. The Upper Indravati Hydro Project (Credit 1356-IN and
Loan 2278-IN) and the Central Power Transmission Project (Loan 2283-IN) were
approved in May 1983, and the Bodhghat Hydroelectric Power Project in Kay
1984. The Second Farakka Thermal Power Project (Loan 2442-IN) was approved
in June 1984, and the Trombay IV Thermal Power Project (Loan 2452-IN) in June
of the same year. The Third Rural Electrification Project is about a year
behind schedule. The first five unizs of the Singrauli Project and the first
two units of the Korba project :-?re commissioned on schedule. The Farakka
and Ramagundam projects are proceeding satisfactorily, the first unit at
Ramagundam having been commissioned four months ahead of schedule. The Third
Trombay Project (Unit 5) (Loan 1549-IN) was first synchronized in January
1984, about a year behind schedule; time was lost mainly because parts for
the boiler were not delivered on time, and because of delays in its construc-
tion.



-6-
1.11    A performance audit conducted in 1980 for the Second Power Transmis-
sion Project (Credit 242-IN) concluded that the project has succeeded in
helping the nine beneficiary SEBs extend their transmission systems and meet
their growing power requirements. Utilization of generating capacity in
these SEBs has exceeded the appraisal forecast. The upgrading of the SEBs'
financial management practices that began under this project will continue
under subsequent projects. The audit highlighted the difficulties of ade-
quately supervising this project (because it consisted of many widely scat-
tered subprojects), and of effecting institutional improvements in the
absence of a close working relationship between the Bank Group and the
beneficiary SEBs. The Bank has therefore scught more direct involvement with
the SEBs through State-specific projects.
Bank Group Strategy in the Power Subsector
1_12    Over the last ten years the Bank Group has assisted GOI in substan-
tially expanding its centrally-owned generation capacity, which is currently
being run relatively efficiently. In the past two years, however, the
emphasis of Bank Group lending has begun to shift from supporting projects
owned and operated by the Central Government to projects owned and operated
by the SEBs. This gradual shift has come about in support of OOI's desire to
accelerate the deveLopment of India's hydroelectric power resources (most of
which are o_ned by the State Governments), and because of the considerable
need to improve the operational and project implementation efficiency and the
finan-ial viability of the State-owned power sector institutions. In paral-
leL w--th this shift in Bank Group lending, sector-wide objectives for power
system operation at both Center and State levels-such as improving
efficiency in the use of existing power generation, transmission and dis-
tribution systems, strengthening Central and State level sector institutions,
improving country-wide power system planning, and increasing resource mobi-
lization within the sector--will continue to be pursued by the Bank Group.
Hore specifically, the principal objectives of the Bank Group's assistance in
the subsector are:
(a) the better use of existing facilities-through transmission
projects improving regional interconnections and through
rehabilitation of plant, particularly of thermal power stations
and distribution networks: these measures will improve the
efficiency of energy use and reduce system losses, thereby
helping to minimize system capital and operating costs;
(b) institution building--although the Bank will continue to maintain
an interest in Central institutions, its efforts will be
broadened to encompass individual SEBs, where substantial
efforts are needed to strengthen management, operations, and
finances;



-7-
(c) improved pLanning--particularly by extending the scope of
planning from the State through the regional to the national
level and through greater integration of planning with other
sectors in the economy, both those that consume electricity and
those that supply other forms of energy; and
(d) improved resource mobilization from electricity consumers - the
principal vehicle for this has been and will continue to be
financial covenants in relation to beneficiaries; however, the
Bank will also continue to stress the importance of relating
tariffs to the economic costs of supply.
Power Supply and Demand in the Northern Region
1.13   -The proposed Project will benefit the Northern Region where public
supplw if electricity is entrusted to the Uttar Pradesh State Electricity
Board (UPSEB), the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB), the Haryana State
Electricity Board (HSEn), The Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU),
the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (RSEB), the Jammu and Kashmir State
Electricity Board (JKSEB), and the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board
(UPSEB). As of March 31, 1984, the comt,ined installed capacity of these SEBs
was about 8,800 NW- Of this about 45% is operated by UPSEB, which is the
largest utility in the Eegion.  PSEB, HEvR and RSEB follow with each uperat-
ing between 12-15% of the Region's installed capacity. The remaining 6Z is
operated by the other SEBs. The utilities controlled by COI, namely, NTPC,
NHPC and the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), provide the region with an
additional capacity of abouc 2,400 MW. Therefore the total installed
capacity available to the Northern Region is about 11,200 MW, (about 26% of
the country's total) consisting of 4,771 MW (43Z) of hydro, 5,958 MW (53Z) of
thermal and 44' MW (4Z) of nuclear power. The Region's installed capacity is
expected to rea.ch almost 20,000 MW by 1990, representing an average annual
increase of about 10.4%, significantly higher than the 7.1Z experienced over
the last five years. Most of the increase will be in thermal capacity, which
is expected to reach around 12,700 MV by 1990 and represent 69% of the
region's total installed capacity. NTPC's installed capacity allocated to
the Region is forecast to increase from 1,770 MW, representing 29% of the
capacity available to the Region ir 1984, to about 4,600 MW, accounting for
35% of the Region's capacity in 1990. NTPC's new facilities would consist of
the Capital Region station (800 NW) to be constructed at Muradnagar, near
Delhi, the ongoing extension at Singrauli (1,000 MW), and the new Rihand
power station (1,000 MW).
1.14    The electricity generation and consumption for the States of the
region during the period FY'79-FY'84 is shown in Annex 1.3. Elect.icity
consumption grew at an average of 7.1% per year during the period, reaching
28,200 GWh in FY'84 and peak demat.d was about 8,700 MW. Industry is the
largest consum-r of electricity in the region, but its share of total con-
sumption, which is about 52%, is below the national average of 56X. On the



-8-
other hand, agriculture's share, which is the second largest, is sig-
nificantly higher than in the country as a whole, 30X compared to 19X. The
Region, therefore, is subject to the disadvantages of high agricultural
demand, characterized by sustained consumption during the daily peak period,
low load factor, and high system losses in distribution. According to the
demand forecast prepared by CEA for the period FY'85-FY'93 (Annex 1.4), the
unconstrained peak demand in the region will reach 20,024 MW in FY'93 at an
average annual growth rate of about 10.8Z. Energy requirements are expected
to increase to 102,432 GWh by FY'93 at an average annual growth rate of about
10.2% during the same period. However, these forecast demands are unlikely
to be met owing to shortage of capacity and operational problems. Deficits
with respect to both peak demand and energy will therefore continue.

II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERKMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
2.01    NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, was established in 1975
as a pubLicly owned utility, under the general supervision of the Ministry of
Energy, 1/ with the responsibility for designing, constructing, and operat-
ing large thermal power stations and transmission systems, and for the sale
of power generated to the SEBs. NTPC's initially authorized share capital of
Rs 1,250 million (US$104.2 million) has increased steadily and has reached
Rs 25,000 million (US$2,083 million) by FY'1983.  On March 31, 1984, the
paid-up capital of the Corporation was Rs 15,668 million (US$1,306 million)_
NTPC has broad powers to carry out its daily operations. Decisions on
investment plans and financing require Government approval before implementa-
tion. NTPC is also subject to periodic examination by the Committee on
Public Undertakings, a body established by GOI to monitor the performance of
public sector enterprises.
Existing Facilities and Development Program
2.02    NTPC commenced generating electricity in 1982 and, by the end of
FY'84, had in operation nine units of 200 MW each: five at Singrauli, three
at Korba and one at Ramagundam.  In addition it operates the 720 MW Badarpur
station near Delhi on a management-fee basis. Transition from the construc-
tion to the operational phase is being carried out successfully. Efficiency
has also been high and unit availability and load factor maintained above the
average regional and national levels (Annex 2.1). The Corporation's power
plants commnissioning program for the 24-year period FY'77-FY'2000 is shown in
Annex 2.2. The program includes 31 generation and transmission projects, of
which 16 have been approved and the remaining 15 projects are currently being
processed for final approval by GOI. NTPC's generating capacity is projected
to increase from 1,800 MW in FY'84 to 10,400 MW by FY'91, 21,580 MW by FY'96
and 27,080 MW by FY'2000. Concurrently, the transmission system would be
expanded to include more than 9,000 km of EHV lines and 37 EHV substations
throughout the country, thus initiating what would eventually evolve into a
national grid for the transmission and exchange of power between NTPC and the
SEBs.  NTPC's investment program and implementa0on schedule are realistic in
terms of NTPC's technical capability.
Organization and Management
2.03    Considering the rapid increase in NTPC's operational and construction
activities, a study to develop a decentralized organizational structure was
taken up in 1981, with the assistance of experts from reputed power utilities
1/ Under the latest reorganization of Government responsibilities, NTPC has
been assumed by the newLy-formed Ministry of Irrigation and Power.



-10-
in the UK and the USA. Based on the result of the study, NTPC has adopted a
regional organizational structure with each Region under the charge of an
ex2cutive director responsible for the design, construction and operation of
generation and transmission facilities within the Region. The decentraliza-
tion of NTPC's operations on a regional basis, was approved by NTPC's Board
on August 16, 1982, and impLementation is almost completed. Regional head-
quarters staff, headed by Executive Regional Directors, have been established
for:
(a)  the Northern Region, comprising the power stations at Singrauli,
Rihand, Badarpur and Muradnagar;
(b)  the Western Region, comprising the power stations at Korba and
Vindhyachal;
(c)  the Southern Region consisting of the Ramagundam power station and a
grid which will have over 3,000 km of 400-kV lines; and
(d)  the Eastern Region consisting of Farakka and Kahalgaon power station
and associated transmission system.
In addition to these regional headquarters, and with the commencement of
construction activity for the transmission system associated with the
proposed Project in the Northern Region and the transmission system
associated with the V.ndhyachal Project in the Western Region, it was decided
to create a division responsibLe for the transmission system in these two
regions. It will ensure adequate attention to the implementation by 1990 of
more than 7,500 kms of transmission lines, 17 substations and the introduc-
tion ir. the country of HVDC facilities. The division was created in May 1984
and is headed by an Executive Director based in Delhi.
2.04    This restructuring has led to decentralization of the implementation
responsibility. The role of the Corporate organization is progressively
becoming one of policy-making and that of providing functional guidance to
the Regions' project and other operating divisions. The principal corporate
functions are finance, personnel and administration, planning and monitoring,
technical, procurement and commercial. The finance, personnel and technical
groups are headed by Directors who are members of NTPC's Board of Directors.
The commercial group, including procurement, is responsible to the Executive
Director (Commercial). The planning and monitoring group reports to the
Chairman and Managing Director. The present corporate organizational struc-
ture is shown in Annex 2.3.
Recruitment and Training
2.05    Recruitment is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to meet
NTPC's expanding operational needs. By the end of FY'84, NTPC had about
13,000 employees. This number is expected to reach about 31,555 by the end



-11-
of FY'90. In the first few years of activity, NTPC has given emphasis to
recruiting and training executives, engineers and supervisors who account at
present for nearly 40Z of its staff. However, with the development of its
operations, this emphasis has been gradually shifting toward the recruitment
of more skilled laborers, who will account for about 70% of its staff by
FY'90. Moreover, NTPC has given high priority to the training of its staff
for which detailed programs have been developed. The approach adopted by
NTPC to effectively meet its large manpower requirement involves
pre-employment and post-employment training. Pre-employment training is
provided to personnel who enter the organization as trainees at varying entry
leveLs and undergo an extensive training program before assuming their per-
manent assignment. The pre-employment training for professional engineers
and executive trainees is tailor-made to meet the requirements in engineer-
ing, personnel and finance. The one-to-two year program provides a com-
prehensive exposure to the conceptual and practical aspects of future assign-
ments. For graduate engineers this includes visits to manufacturer's works
and training on simulators; a 200 MW simulator has been installed at Korba
power station and a 500 MW is being procured. There are also training
schemes for non-graduate engineers (i.e. diploma holders). These one-year
schemes have a strong practical bias as these trainees are earmarked to
assume responsibilities in the operations and maintenance functions. For
skilled Laborers, training is highly job-oriented and aims to develop the
necessary skills required for working as operators and artisans for power
plants, load dispatch and transmission facilities. The post-employment
training schemes, provides training to personnel who are already employed by
the Corporation or who have joined the Corporation with previous experience,
but need some exposure to the expertise required in their new assignments.
Training centers have been established at NTPC's plant locations. These
centers with workshops, training materials, and hostel facilities are
designed to train young graduates, diploma holders and operating staff. NTPC
also provides adequate training in management and other areas in the power
sector in two specialized centers, the Centre for Education in Power Manage-
ment in Delhi and the Central Institute of Training at Badarpur. In addi-
tion, specific programs are organized in collaboration with power organiza-
tions of international repute, (e.g. the Central Electricity Generating Board
of the U.K.).

III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    GOI's strategy for meeting the future demand for power has involved
an accelerated orogram for the development of coal-fired thermal pLants,
particularly those which can be installed near or at open pit mines. One of
the largest coalfields is located in the Singrauli region, about 500 km west
of Calcutta at the border between Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (Hap IBRD
18595). The development of this field, with estimated coal resources of
around 10 billion tons, has recently been financed by the Bank under the
Dudhichua Coal Project (Loan 2393-IN). The field is expected to produce
about 40 million tons of thermal coal per year in the mia-1990s. in order to
utilize this resource, NTPC's development program calls for the installation
in the region of three super thermal power stations with an ultimate total
installed capacity of about 7,300 MW, divided among Singrauli (2,000 MW),
Rihand (3,000 MW) and Vindhyachal (2,300 MW).l/ Presently, five units of 200
MW each are already in operation at Singrauli and the construction of the
first 500 MW units at Singrauli and Rihand has been initiated. In associa-
tion with the development of this generating capacity, CEA has outlined, with
the assistance of Hydro Quebec International (HQI), Canada, a least-cost
program for the development of the transmission system necessary to ensure
the efficient and economic evacuation of power from the Singrauli-Rihand
stations to the northern grid system. The transmission program calls for the
implementation of a combined AC/DC system, comprising a + 500-kV HVDC line to
be constructed in combination with extensions to the existing 400-kV AC
system to transmit the power to the SEBs in the Northern Region. The com-
bined AC/DC system was selected to allow for the transmission of large blocks
of energy over long distance through the HVDC link, and its distribution to
the SEBs through the 400/220-kV AC system. This combination would reduce
losses and ensure the efficient transmission of power from the power plants
to the main load centers in the northern region.
Project Objectives
3.02    The objectives of the proposed Project are to continue the institu-
tion building efforts initiated under the Bank Group's earlier lending opera-
tions by strengthening the capabilities of CEA and NTPC in formulating and
implementing an investment program aimed at meeting the future demand for
electricity at least cost. The main objective is to assist NTPC in meeting
1/ The Bank is financing the development of Singrauli station (Cr. 685-IN
and Cr. 1027-IN) in conjunction with the Federal Republic of Germany,
while UK and USSR are financing, respectively, the first stage of Rihand
and Vindhyachal stations.



-13-
the electricity demand in the Northern Region by providing transmission
linkage between the coal-based thermal power plants at Singrauli and Rihand,
and the main load centers in the Northern Region and ensuring the evacuation
of power from the plants at least cost to the economy. It would also serve
as a vehicle for the introduction of new technology, HVDC links, needed to
ensure the continued implementation of NTPC ongoing program for the expansion
and reinforcement of the EHV transmission grid. Moreover, the introduction
of the HVDC system would allow for the distribution of specified blocks of
electricity from the central stations to individual States and between
regions which are often operating at different frequency margins. In addi-
tion the proposed Project would, through the associated transmission study
(para 3.07), contribute significantly to the rationalization and integration
of an EHV grid and to the long-term objective of ensuring economic intercon-
nections within and among the different regions of the country. .herefore,
the proposed Project would complement the progress made under the Pank
financed the Central Power Transmission Project (Loan 2283-IN) and further
GOI's and the Bank's joint strategy for the development of a national, tech-
nically reliable and economically justified generation and transmission
system.
Project Description
3.03    The proposed Project, the physical aspects of which are described in
detail in Annex 3.1, would comprise:
(a) a + 500-kV HVDC bi-polar transmission line of about 910 km,
connectirg Rihand and Delhi, and the associated AC/DC converting
stations for an initial capacity of 1,000 MW and related auxiliary
equipment at Rihand and Delhi;
(b)  about 1,450 km of 400-kV single and double-circuit AC lines,
connecting the Rihand and Singrauli stations with Kanpur, Delhi,
Panipat and Jaipur, and the construction or expansion of related
substations with associated auxiliaries; and
kc)  technical assistance for the engineering, testing and
commissioning of the Project.
Project Cost
3.04    The estimated cost of the proposed Project, including contingencies
but excluding duties and taxes, is Rs 6,950.3 million (US$579.2 million).
Taxes and duties would amount to about Rs 1,040.0 million (US$86.7 million).
Interest during construction adds Rs. 324.7 million (US$27.1 million) to the
financing required. The direct and indirect foreign currency costs are
estimated at about Rs 3,380.8 million (US$281.8 million), which represent
about 412 of the total financing required. The estimated costs of the
Project are set out in Annex 3.2 and summarized in Table 3.1 below.

The cost estimates for the main items of equipment and materials related to
the 400-kV AC facilities are based on the most recent quotations received
for similar projects with prices updated to December 1984 levels. As for the
HVDC facilities, estimates are based on indicative proposals made by some of
the firms with extensive experience in HVDC installation which compared
favorably with recently submitted prices for similar works in other
countries. The estimated cost of consulting services covering (i) man-month
rate, (ii) reimbursable items, and (iii) subsistence and other allowances in
India are based on experience with other projects under preparation and
execution in India. The cost of the technical assistance for overseas train-
ing of Indian engineers was determined on the basis of standard prices
provided by internationally reputable firms. Physical contingencies of about
10% on civil works and 5% on equipment were assumed on the basis of
experience with similar projects which are considered adequate. Price con-
tingencies for local costs for equipment and erection were assumed at 8.5%
for FY'86 to FY'91, and 6% thereafter. Price contingencies for foreign costs
were assumed at 9% annually from FY'86 to FY'88, 7.5% for FY'89 and 6Z there-
after. Interest during construction takes into account the progressive
comnissioning of the 400-kV AC lines.

Project Financing
3.05    The proposed financing plan assumes a Bank loan of US$250 million,
representing about 43Z of the totaL project cost net of taxes and duties.
The terms and condition of Bank loan and onlending arrangements between GOI
and NTPC are detailed in paragraph 4.16. GOI and kTPC are also considering
additional sources of financing in the form of co-mercial/supplier's credits
or bilateral assistance, particularly for the foreign cost of the AC-DC
terminals. The balance of the financing required would be provided by GOI,
in the form of loan and share capital, and NTPC's own resources. The follow-
ing table summarizes the proposed financing plan:
Table 3.2

411.2     281.8      693.0
The plan assumes that cofinancing of about US$135 million would be secured
for equipment for the HVDC terminals. If cofinancing in excess of $135
million is forthcoming, the proposed Bank loan would accordingly be reallo-
cated to cover an increased share of the local cost.
Engineering and Studies
3.06    Following the project feasibility study prepared by CEA (para 3.01),
detailed system and engineering studies were undertaken by NTPC, in close
association with their consultant, HQI, financed by CIDA of Canada. These
studies, which were completed in September 1984, covered the simulation of
energy flow and network design. Moreover, the consulting services by HQI
focussed on maximizing the transfer of these new techniques to CEA and NTPC
staff by de-?eloping their expertise in power systems analysis and setting
specifications for the performance of equipment. NTPC is now preparing the
detailed specifications of the HVDC components of the project and will retain
consultants to assist in supervising the engineering activities during the
supply of equipment, construction, testing, and commissioning of that part of
the project. At the request of NTPC, the foreign cost of these technical



-16-
services, covering about 165 man-months of service, would be financed under
the proposed Project. As for the engineering of the 400-kV AC transmission
design and construction details of this system have already been standardized
for all India as a result of the experience gained by the SEBs and NTPC in
impLementing similar projects in the past. This has provided the basis for
detailed design of the 400-kV lines and substations included in the Project.
3.07    The increase in the size of the generating units and plants, the
expansion of the 400-kV grid and the introduction of HVDC facilities needed
to keep up with the growth of the power subsector, have made it necessary to
extend the country's EHV power transmission system. Therefore in conjunction
with the proposed Project, CEA, will carry out a series of power transmission
studies, to be financed by GOI from its own resources. These studies will be
undertaken for each of the Regions and will form the basis for the formula-
tion of a least-cost, long-term (15-to 20-year) national power transmission
plan for the development of the high-voltage power transmission system; the
plan will include the configuration of a primary grid, interregional
linkages, and system control requirements. Further s:udies will be
instituted by GOI as necessary to address the responsibilities, policies,
and procedures pertaining to the institutional, commercial, operational and
training aspects of the system at the State, regional, and national levels.
C0I agreed during negotiations that the scope and terms of reference for the
studies will be prepared by CEA in collaboration with the Bank by December
31, 1985, and consultants will be appointed or retained as necessary to
assist and train CEA staff in their execution. The studies and the national
power transmission plan will be completed, and the results reviewed with the
Bank, by June 30, 1987.
Construction and Procurement
3.08    NTPC is currently successfully implementing, through contractors, the
400-kV lines and substations in conjunction with the construction of its
thermal power projects. The same approach would be followed for the con-
struction of the 400-kV AC facilities included under the proposed Project.
The equipment (conductors, insulators, hardware, metering, telecommunication
and substation equipment), and civil works estimated to cost about US$150
million, would be procured through international competitive bidding. The
supply of towers and lines erection estimated at US$60 million, would be
carried out through separate contracts under local competitive bidding. The
HVDC line material, as well as the construction of the line, estimated at
about US$91 million, would be procured through international competitive
bidd ng. The main equipment of the HVDC terminals would be purchased through
negotiated contract or international competitive bidding depending on the
results of cofinancing arrangements (para 3.05). This contract, which also
includes erection works, is estimated to amount to around US$176 million. In
addition, the contract would include adequate provision for training NTPC's
staff since the HVDC facilities would be introduced in the Indian power
sector. Accessories and miscellaneous equipment related to HVDC terminals,



-17-
estimated at about US$17 million, would be procured through international
competitive bidding. Table 3.3 below summarizes the proposed status of
procurement arrangements.

3.09    Procurement of equipment, materials, civil and erection works amount-
ing to about US$260 million, would be on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Documents for
individual contracts above US$ 3,500,000 equivalent would be subject to prior
review by the Bank. Local contractors and manufacturers would be expected to
bid for almost all categories of equipment and materials of the AC facilities

and HVDC lines. Local manufacturers competing under international competi-
tive bidding will have a 15Z preference or the applicable duty, whichever is
less, for supply of goods. Consultants for project supervision would be
selected in accordance with Bank guidelines and employed under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The planned schedule for procurement cf
the equipment and material to be financed by the proposed Bank loan is:
(i) start of bid invitation: October 30, 1984; (ii) first bid opening:
January 21, 1985; (iii) first award decision: Hay 15, 1985; and (iv) first
contract signature: June 15, 1985. Accordingly, NTPC has requested the Bank
to authorize advance procurement and retroactive financing of up to US$20
million to cover expenditures under contracts awarded after April 15, 1985
and prior to Loan signing, and in accordance with Bank guidelines for
procurement, in respect to the supply of equipment for the AC facilities and
HVDC line, and associated consultancy services.
Project Implementation and Completion
3.10    Taking into account the advanced stage of project preparation and
expected timing of procurement, the project completion is expected by the end
of 1988. This completion date is in accordance with the time schedule
foreseen for the completion of the Rihand power station currently under
construction. The implementation schedule for the proposed Project is shown
in Annex 3.3.
Disbursement
3.11    Disbursement from the proposed loan would be against 100% of the
ex-factory cost of equipment and materials procured in India, 100% of the
foreign cost of equipment and materials procured abroad and 90Z of the civil
and erection works, these being subject to international competitive bidding.
Disbursement from the proposed loan would also be made against 100% of the
cost of consultancy for project supervision. The estimated schedule of
disbursements as provided in Annex 3.4, was determined by NTPC and relate to
the Project implementation schedule (Annex 3.3). The disbursement pe-ofile
for the Project is much faster than the Bank's standard profile for a power
project in India, 4.5 years as opposed to 10, but this is reasonable given
the weight of generation projects in the latter. The profile is also faster
than the Bank-wide standard profile for transmission and distribution
projects, which is 7 years. However, the Bank is satisfied that the proposed
profile is reasonable and reflects NTPC's experience in transmission line
construction and the advanced stage of project preparation. Negotiations
for equipment for the HVDC terminals are already well advanced and supply
of this equipment is unlikely to cause delays affecting Bank financed ele-
ments of the Project.



-21-
Ecology
3.12    No ecological problems are expected.  Conductor sizes and spacing
Aill be designed to keep energy losses and radio interference within accept-
able limits. Furthermore, with the introduction of DC line and higher volt-
age (500-kV), the area of the transmission corridor, and therefore the area
of right of way, is significantly reduced as compared with a system of
similar capacity using AC or lower voltage.
Project Risks
3.13    No risks, other than those normally associated with this type of
pro,auz qre foreseen.  In view of NTPC's previous experience with transmis-
sion construction, it is expected that the risk of slippage would be minimal.
in particular, for the DC facilities, discussions with equipment suppliers
have indicated that HVDC terminals can be comissioned in 36 months after the
orders are placed on a turnkey basis. The DC line require comparatively
simple towers and need only two-phase conductors to be strung.  Any possible
slippage wouLd have a negative impact only if the construction of Rihand
power station is progressing faster than the Project implementation. NTPC,
being responsible for both projects, will ensure appropriate coordination of
the different activities during implementation of the projects in order to
achieve the target dates for compLetion. Risk of damage due to fire, explo-
sion, etc. would be covered by the respective contractors during the con-
struction phase and by GOI, through its self-insurance policy, after commis-
sioning.
Project Monitoring
3.14    NTPC wilL submit quarterly reports covering physical progress, con-
sultants' work, costs, disbursements and administrative aspects of the
Project. In addition, there will be annual reports on the financial position
and management situation of the Corporatioc. Progress on the long-term
transmission study will be reported regularly by CEA and reviewed against
the agreed program.

IV. FINANCE
Accounting Organization and Systems
4.01    NTPC, assisted by A.F. Ferguson Co. (India), designed in 1979 and
has since implemented well conceived accounting and internal control systems.
These cover financial and cost accounting, contract accounting and manage-
ment, inventory control, billing, fixed assets accounting, and payroll.
Moreover the corporation has established decentralized autonomous accounting
organizations at the site of each plant in operation. A.F. Ferguson Co.,
since 1979, has been engaged in the monitoring of the implementation of the
systems at plant sites and assisting in the training of the accounting staff
on an on-going basis. Management information and budgetary control systems
were intzoduced in 1979. These are well designed and review of their results
prove them to be effective in providing the inputs needed for planning and
monitoring NTPC's project construction activities and commercial operations.
An internal audit unit has been established with adequate systems and
qualified staff. Accounting practices, procedures and staffing are satisfac-
tory. Training of accounting staff is well planned and organized, and
recruitment of qualified staff is progressing at a rate sufficient to meet
the forecast manpower requirements of the financial complex of the organiza-
tion.
Past Performance and Present Financial Position
4.02    NTPC is currently in the ninth year of an investment program
initiated in 1977 (Annex 4.1) which originally envisaged the construction of
four large thermal stations at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundum and Farakka, to
provide a total installed capacity of 7,300 MW and about 6,000 km of
associated transmission lines. At the time, the cost of this program was
estimated at about Rs 41,000 million (US$3,417 million). Since then, the
investment program has been increased to about Rs 423,000 million (US$35,243
million) to accomodate the increased demand for power. By the end of FY'84,
NTPC had an installed generating capacity of 1,800 KW (Annex 2.2). NTPC
started its comercial operations in FY'83, consequently there is no history
of financial operating performance prior to that year. Operations during
FY'83 were minimal due to start-up and testing procedures required for the
stabilization of the newly comissioned generating units. Despite these
constraints, net earnings of Rs 46 million for FY'83 compared favorably with
Rs 45 million previously forecast for the year. The financial performance
for FY'84 is provided in Annex 4.3. Sales revenue for that year was Rs 1,398
million, representing an increase of Rs 96 million (7%) over the projections
prepared in 1983. The higher revenue was due to the increased energy sales,
actual of 3,845 CWh compared to 3,675 GWh originally forecast, and higher
tariffs, 36.45 compared to 35.45 paise per kWh initially projected in 1983.
Total operating expenses of Rs 723 million were the sAme as previously



-23-
projected due to Lower operations and maintenance costs and lower deprecia-
tion costs which offset completely the increase in fuel costs of Rs 164
miLlion over the 1983 forecast. The higher fuel bill was attributable to
three factors: (a) the generation of more power than was forecast which
required more primary energy than was planned; (b) the unanticipated increase
in the price of domestic coal; and, (c) the increased reliance on oil to
compensate for shortages of coal attributable to supply constraints during
the monsoon period. NTPC is taking measures to build up a sufficient
stock-pile reserve of coal at each station, to ensure a constant supply for
operations and thereby reduce the consumption of oil. Operations and main-
tenance costs and depreciation were lower than projected as a consequence of
slippage in the initiation of commercial operations of the newly commissioned
power stations. NTPC capitalizes costs, other thani fuel, during the period
between commissioning and the start of comnercial operations rather than
charging these costs to operations. Depreciation is charged to operations
only for assets that are under commercial operations. As a result of the
above variances in sales revenue and operating expenses, operating income of
Rs 675 million for FY'84 exceeded the previous forecast by Rs 96 million
(17Z), yielding a financial rate of return on unrevalued assets of 11.3%
compared to 7.1% previously forecast. The rate of return compares favorably
with the 7% minimum rate of return on unrevalued assets required for FY'85-90
under Loan 2442-IN. The equivalent financial rate of return on revalued
assets, calculated on a pro-forma basis, is approximately 8.8Z for FY'84
which is satisfactory. Net profits of Rs 449 million exceeded the previous
projections by Rs 253 million attributable to a decrease in interest expense
on GOI loans, deferred expenses written-off (not previously planned), and the
above favorable variance in operating income.  With exception of the increase
in fuel costs NTPC's performance in FYs'83 and '84 was satisfactory.
4.03    Cash generation measured as a percentage of average annual capital
investment requirements, was 5Z for FY'83 and 3Z for FY'84. Details are
presented in Annex 4.2. For FY'84, the low contribution to investment was
attributable to the fact that generation during the year amounted to only 43%
of potential output mainly due to the time required to stabilize, and to the
fact that 1,000 MW of the total 1,800 MW at year-end were commissioned and in
operation progressively from the sixth to twelfth month of the year, only.
Assets in operation and producing income at FY'84 year-end represented only
40% of total capital expenditure to date. The lower ratio of cash generation
in the earlier years of NTPC's commercial operations is further commented
upon in para 4.06.
4.04    NTPC's collection of accounts receivable has been slower than is
considered accepcable. As of July 31, 1984, outstanding receivables on the
average represented about 3.9 months of NTPC's total sales. According to the
terms of the bulk supply contracts NTPC's customers are required to remit
payment for power purchases within 30 days of receiving bills from NTPC. The
contracts also require that the NTPC customers open revolving bank letters of



-24-
credit in favor of NTPC for an amount equivalent to one month's power pur-
chases. At present, five of the nine customers concerned in the Northern and
Western Regions have complied with this requirement; none of NTPC's customers
in the Southern and Eastern Regions has yet done so as bulk supply contracts
for these were concluded only recently, only a limited amount of power is
available from NTPC's Ramagundam plant, and NTPC's Farakka plant is yet to be
commissioned. NTPC has encountered resistance from some of its customers
concerning the opening of letters of credit, because at this stage of
development of the transmission network, power frequently has to be routed
through one or more States before it reaches its ultimate destination, and as
a result NTPC is not able to ensure that they receive their allocated shares
of power. In view of this situation, it was agreed during negotiations that
the required letters of credit would be opened for each NTPC customer within
30 days of their receiving their allocated shares of power. In the meantime,
NTPC will continue to make every effort to obtain letters of credit from
those customers which have not yet opened them (para 6.02(a)). With regard
to the arrears in NTPC's accounts receivable, these have arisen primarily in
connection with NTPC's sales of electricity prior to the signing of the bulk
supply agreements with its customers, during which time electricity was being
soLd at interim rates which were subject to subsequent adjustment. NTPC
agreed during negotiations to provide the Bank with repayment timetables, by
December 31, 1985, drawn up in conjunction with each of the customers in
arrears in its payments, with the objective of liquidating the outstanding
arrears within two years (para 6.02(c)). It was also agreed during nego-
tiations that NTPC will ensure that with respect to its sales of electricity
since the signing of the bulk supply agreements, its total monthly accounts
receivable will be maintained, from March 31, 1986, at a level equivalent to
not more than two months' sales (para 6.02(b)).
4.05    NTPC's fixed assets as of March 31, 1984 amounted to Rs 22,794 mil-
lion which was comprised of work-in-progress of Rs 13,767 million and plant
in operation of Rs 9,197 million (Annex 4.4). The plant in operation is
comprised of commissioned generating units (1,800 MW) and associated trans-
mission facilities. Current liabilities of Rs 2,142 million are high due to
receipt of GOI project financing subsequent to the FY'84 year-end, for items
purchased prior to the year-end. Receipt of such financing prior to year-end
would have been applied to payables outstanding for construction materials,
resulting in a reduction of current liabilities at March 31, 1984. The debt
to equity ratio of 26/174 is satisfactory. With the exception of the improve-
ment required in accounts receivable collections, NTPC's financial operations
for FY'84 and its financial position at year-end were satisfactory.

4.06   NTPC's capital expenditure for the development of its system for the
period FY'77-'96 amounts to Rs 422,911 million (US$35,243 million) (Annex
4.1). NTPC's total external financing requirements would be met by GOI
equity contribution through the issue of share capital of Rs 173,026 million,
and by long-term loans of Rs 179,829 million. Foreign financing through Bank
loans, bilateral loans and aid, and co-financing is expected to contribute,
as in the past, at approximately 30Z of financing requirements. NTPC's
internal cash generation is projected to contribute about 30X to the total
capital investment requirements, increasing from about 3% in FY'84 (para
4.03) to about 36Z in FY'93. The lower ratio of cash generation to capital
investment during this earlier period of the FY'77-'96 investment program is
due to the high level of capital expenditure relative to the assets which
were in operation and generating cash income. This was foreseen for the
earlier years of NTPC's commercial operations, and for this reason the finan-
cial rate of return on net assets in operation was selected, in preference to
cash generation as contribution to investment, to monitor NTPC's financial
performance. In FYs'94, '95 and '96 internal cash generation is projected to
be about 52Z, 66Z and 95Z for each year respectively. Future upward revi-
sions of the investment program, which are expected with the passage of time,
would bring the level of cash generation for this period down to about the
40% level usually associated with an 8% or 9X rate of return cn revalued
assets, with the rate of return also remaiaing at a satisfactory level (para
4.08). The Bank intends to monitor the adequacy of NTPC's cash generation,
as a check to determine the adequacy of the rate of return on net unrevalued
assets.  The benchmark ratios the Bank would use for this purpose, would be
a minimum cash generation contribution to investment of 10% in FY'88, 13Z
in FY'90, 25% in FY'92 and 40Z in FY'94 and each year thereafter. Dividends
on equity share capital are not anticipated in the forecasts on the assump-
tion that surplus funds would be applied to the investment program. NTPC's
investment program and financing plan for FYs'77-96 are satisfactory.
Details of the forecast financing plan are set out in Annex 4.2.
Future Performance and Financial Position 1/
4.07    NTPC's consolidated income statement covers projected financial
performance for FY'85 to FY'96 (Annex 4.3). This period was selected for
the financial projections as FY'96 would be the first year in which all GOI
approved generation projects would be fully stabilized and operating at full
capacity. The assumptions used for the forecasts are presented in Annex 4.8.
Power generation is projected to increase from 1,109 GWh in FY'83, to 47,606
GWh in FY'91, and to 106,161 GWh in FY'96. The average tariff is forecast to
1/ All figures are expressed in current prices. Refer to Annex 4.8 para
2(c), for the escalation factors used.



-26-
increase from 32.30 paise/kWh to 67.95 paise/kWh and to 93.22 paise/kWh for
the same years respectively, on the basis of applying the formwla factors of
the regional bulk supply contracts. The increase in NTPC's average tariff
would represent an annual average rate of growth of about 8.5% between FY'83
and FY'96, which would slightly exceed the expected rate of inflation and
thus result in a small increase in the tariff in reaL terms. This would
maintain the average tariff at about parity with the LRMC (para 4.11).
Revenue from sales of electricity is projected to increase from Rs 1,398
million in FY'84, to Rs 29,602 million in FY'91, and to Rs 91,038 million in
FY'96.
4.08    Operating expenses, comprised of fuel costs, operations and main-
tenance expenses and depreciation, remain relatively constant as reflected by
operating costs as a percentage of sales revenue which varies, for the period
FY'84-FY'96, from about 50% for FY'84, 56% for FY'90, and 54Z for FY'96.
Operating income is projected to increase from Rs 675 million in FY'84, to Rs
13,448 million in FY'91, and to Rs 42,236 million in FY'96. This would yield
a financial rate of return on unrevalued net assets in operation of about
11.3% in FY'84 and FY'91, and 14.7Z in FY'96. Between FY'84 and FY'91, the
financial rates of return vary between 9.4% and 1'.5X. The variation during
this period is attributable to the fact that common facilities, serving and
supporting the total complement of generating units at each station, are
completed and transferred to assets in operation prior to the completion and
commissioning of most of the power units which produce saLes and consequently
income. The value of these assets cannot be separated and therefore tends to
depress the rate of return by overstating the value of net assets in opera-
tion. Both the financial rate of return and internal cash generation (Annex
4.2) would increase together to reach acceptable levels of about 12% and 52%,
respectively, by FY'94. Under Loan 2442-IN, GOI and NTPC agreed to achieve
annual rates of return on unrevalued net assets in operation of not less than
7% in FY'85 through FY'90, 9.5% in FY'91 through FY'95, and thereafter,
annual rates of return at levels satisfactory to ensure the financial
viability of NTPC. It was agreed that the 14.7% rate of return, reflected in
the financial projections for FY'96, would satisfactorily ensure such finan-
cial viability. NTPC's current projections comply with these covenanted
rates of return. The covenant has been repeated for the proposed Project,
and GOI and NTPC agreed during negotiations that NTPC would achieve annual
rates of return on unrevalued net assets in operation as described above for
Loan 2442-IN (para 6.02(d)). Current projections reflect a 14.7% rate of
return in FY'96 which is still considered satisfactory to ensure the finan-
cial viability of NTPC. A rate of return of 7% on net unrevalued assets
would reflect positive net income after interest expense, and cash generation
after debt service, in each of the years FY'85 to FY'90. It should be noted,
however, should NTPC achieve only the minimum 7% rate of return during this
period, it would not imply an adverse effect on implementation of the invest-
ment program as GOI would cover any resulting deficiency in the planned
financing. It should also be noted that NTPC's projected rates of return are
realistic and achievable. The equivalent financial rates of return on net



-27-
revalued assets, based on a pro-forna revaluation (Annex 4.6), are 8.8Z in
FY'84, 7.2% in FY'91 and 7.5% in FY'96 which are satisfactory. GOI continues
to oppose the principle of revaluation of assets, operated by public sector
undertakings, and the calculation of depreciation on the basis of revalued
assets. The Bank, however, prepared under Loan 2442-IN, and for the proposed
Project, a pro-forma revaluation of NTPC's net assets in operation for pur-
poses of checking the adequacy of the rates of return on unrevalued assets.
The Bank has consequently, as an alternative to a rate of return on revalued
assets, raised the minimum rate of return on unrevalued assets from 9.5Z in
FY'96 and thereafter, to a level considered satisfactory to ensure the con-
tinuing financial viability of NTPC. The level of 14.7% reflected in the
projections (Annex 4.3) is satisfactory to achieve this objective. This
compensates for the failure to revalue by providing a higher return on
unrevalued assets, than normally required, to ensure sufficient cash gener-
ation to provide a satisfactory level of contribution to investment and to
provide for renewal and replacement of -assets as they reach the end of their
useful life. We would expect that NTPC would continue, as in the past, to
provide the necessary data to enable the Bank to calculate rates of return on
revalued assets, on a pro-forma basis, to be used as a check on the adequacy
of rates of return on unrevalued assets.
4.09    Net earnings, after interest expense, were Rs 449 million in FY'84,
representing about 32% of sales revenue. These are projected to increase to
Rs 6,824 million in FY'91 and to Rs 25,622 million in FY'96 representing 23%
and 28% of sales revenue respectively. The ratio of net earnings-to sales is
higher in the early years of the projections, due to proportionately lower
interest expense, owing to GOI's practice of advancing to NTPC the equity
part of project financing before the start of GOI loan disbursements. The
net earnings ratio to sales, however, improves in the later years of the
projections owing to loan repayments and the resulting interest saving.
NTPC's forecast of future financial performance and cash generation are
satisfactory.
4.10    Forecast Balance Sheets, for each year FY'85 through FY'96, are set
out in Annex 4.4. A statement of source and application of funds for the
same period is provided in Annex 4.5. These reflect the commencement of
commercial operations in FY'83, and the financing of NTPC's capital require-
ments through generation of internal resources, and through a combination of
long-term borrowing and equity capital. Initially the equity portion of
financing would be released by GOI, followed by loan capital, except in the
case of the Bank loan for the proposed Project, which the Bank intends to
lend directly to NTPC (para 4.16).  Table 4.1 sunmarizes NTPC's financial
position at three significant points in its development, namely: at March 31,
1983, the year in which NTPC commenced commercial operations and became
revenue earning, at March 31, 1990, the year following the year in which the
proposed project would be completed, and at March 31, 1995, the first full
year in which all generating units, of the projects presently officially
approved by GOI, would be operatfng at full capacity. These forecasts show



-28-
that in FY'83 when NTPC started generation and commercial sale of elec-
tricity, total capitalization was Rs 15,050 million (US$1,254 million),
divided between GOI Loans (including the onlending of Bank Group credits and
loans) and equity in a ratio of 21/79. Seven year later (March 31, 1990),
after the proposed Project is completed, total capitalization would rise to
Rs 183,585 million (US$15,299 million), reflecting a debt/equity ratio of
34/64. The debt/equity ratio would increase slightly to 35/65 by March 31,
1995 at which point capitalization would have increased to Rs 397,597 mil-
lion. The lower debt/equity ratio in FY'83 compared to FYs'90 and '95 is
attributable to the drawdown of project equity financing prior to loan
financing. For this reason, also, the debt service coverage (Annex 4.5) is
projected to decrease from 3.5:1 in FY'84 to 2.0:1 in FY'90, and due to loan
repayments, increase from FY'91 to FY'95 to 2.2:1 and 2.7:1 respectiveLy.
NTPC's debt/equity ratios, debt service coverage and financial position, as
reflected in the projections, are satisfactory.

NTPC's Regional Tariffs
4.11    A comparison of NTPC's projected regional tariffs to LRMC for the
period FY'85 - FY'96, is provided in Annex 4.7. The LRMC, in FY'85 prices,
have been escalated annually by inflation factors of 8.5% in FYs'85-'91, and
6.0% in FY'92 and thereafter, to provide a comparison with the regional
tariffs, which are expressed in current prices.   The Northern Region tariffs
increase from 32.3 paise/kWh in FY'83 to 56.9 in FY'88, to 70.5 in FY'91, and
to 97.7 in FY'96, representing a compound annual increase from FYs'85-96, of
about 9%. As a percentage of LRMC the Northern Region tariffs represent
about 90% in FY'85, 100% in FY'88, and about 992 in FY'96. The projected



-30-
tariffs for the Western Region increase from 36.0 paise/kWh in FY'84 to 52.5
in FY'88, to 66.3 in FY'91, and to 89.4 in FY'96 representing a compound
annual increase of about 8% from FY'84-'96. As a percentage of 1.RMC the
Western Region tariffs represent, for FYs'85, '88, '91, and '96, about 102%,
105%, 104% and 102% respectively. Southern Region tariffs are projected to
increase from 50.0 paise/kWh in FY'84 to 59.5 in FY'88, to 67.3 in FY'91 and
to 93.9 in FY'96, representing a compound annual increase of about 5X from
FYs'84-'96. The Southern Region tariffs, as a percentage of LRMC, would be
about 127%, 109%, 97% and 99Z for FYs'85, '88, '91 and '96 respectively. The
tariffs of the Eastern Region are projected to increase from 52.5 paise/kWh
in FY'86, to 55.5 in FY'88, to 65.6 in FY'91 and 92.6 in FY'96, representing
an annual compound increase of about 6% from FYs'86-'96. As a percentage of
LRMC, the Eastern Region tariffs represent 115Z, 103%, 96Z and 99% for
FYs'86, '88, '91 and '96 respectively. NTPC's average tariff increases from
32.30 paise/kWh in FY'83 to 56.02 in FY'88, to 67.95 in FY'91, and to 93.22
in FY'96, representing a compound annual increase of 8.5%. Although the
relationship of Regional tariffs to LRMC fluctuates to some extent, due to
the lumpiness of investments, and at points in time the tariffs exceed LRMC
between FY'85 and FY'91, it smoothes out and remains relatively constant and
close to LRMC from FYs'91 to '96. NTPC's projected regional tarifks are
lower than the projected cost of generation for each of the SEB's of the
Northern Region, with the exception of PSEB. In the case of PSEB, NTPC's
tariffs would be higher in the range of about 8Z to 11% over the period
FY'86-FY'95.  SEB purchases of power from NTPC consequently would not distort
least-cost system operation in the Northern Region.
4.12    NTPC's projected financial performance and financial position, as
reflected by its financial rates of return on both unrevalued and revalued
net assets (para 4.08). incernal cash generation as a contribution to invest-
ment (para 4.06), debL, quity ratio, financial position and debt service
coverage (para 4.10), and the favorable relationship between regional tariffs
levels and LRMC (para 4.11), wouild indicate that NTPC will progressively
develop towards being a financially sound and viable organization, able to
maintain a satisfactory level of self-financing of its investmeat program and
replacement and renewal of assets.
Commercial Arrangements for Sale of NTPC Power
4.13    Under previous loans and credits, GOI and NTPC agreed to sell the
power from NTPC's power plants to its customers under contracts satisfactory
to the Bank Group. Contracts have now been concluded between NTPC and the
Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking, the Damodar Valley Corporation, the
Electricity Department of the Union Territory of Goa, and all but two of the
SEBs, with respect to sales of electricity from the four major Regional
plants--Singrauli (Northern Region), Korba (Western Region), Ramagundam
(Southern Region), and Farakka (Eastern Region). The Bihar and West Bengal
SEBs are not expected to receive power from the Farakka plant for some time,
as the first 200 MW unit there is yet to be commissioned. GOI and NTPC



-31-
agreed, during negotiations for the proposed project, that contracts in
respect of these SEBs would be concluded and provided to the Bank by August
31, 1985 (para 6.03(e)). The Electricity Department of the Union Territory
of Pondicherry is not expected to receive power from the Ramagundam plant
umtil the commissioning of the second stage, which begins in early 1988.  A
contract in respect of this entity is therefore not yet required but will be
concluded at the appropriate time.
4.14    The contracts concluded to date are interim contracts only, since
certain additional provisions--contract renewal, tariff revision, capacity
charge, and NTPC's return on equity--need to be included. GOI and NTPC
propose in due course to replace these interim contracts with either
individual or regional supply contracts (one for each Region) that will
provide uniform terms and conditions for the sale of electricity by NTPC to
all SEBs and other customers within each region. Accordingly, GOt and NTPC
agreed during negotiations to provide to the Bank, by March 31, 1986, revised
bulk suppLy contracts incorporating the necessary additional provisions with
respect to the SEBs and other NTPC customers of the Northern, Western,
Southern and Eastern Regions. In the interim, the terms of the existing
contracts will continue to apply (para 6.02(f)).
Taxation
4.15    NTPC is liable for income tax under the Income Tax Act, however, in
view of NTPC's large capital expenditure program, tax relief is provided
beyond the period of the present investment program and financial projec-
tions. A tax equalization reserve, therefore, is not necessary.
Bank Loan for the Proposed Project
4.16    GOI's policy in financing projects of NTPC, and other central public
sector undertakings, has been to provide 50% of project financing require-
ments as loans, including the onlending of Bank loans, and the remaining 50Z
as equity share capital. The loan financing has been disbursed to the entity
subsequent to drawdown of the total equity portion. The consequence of this
practice has been that Bank loan disbursements has been, in effect, onlent as
equity with NTPC incurring no loan liability or interest cost until GOI loan
drawdowns commence. This would be in about the fourth year of implementa-
tion, in the case of the proposed Project. This practice is not good
resource mobilization in respect to the interest foregone by GOI. Moreover,
it introduces unwarranted financial practices on the part of NTPC, insofar as
they do not absorb the interest due, nor the liability incurred, on the
relevant loan financing. The tariffs, consequently, understate full costs as
the true interest cost is not reflected in the cost of supply. If Bank loans
were onlent to NTPC at the time of the Bank's loan disbursements, interest
costs would be incurred by the entity, during project implementation, and
correctly apportioned between capital costs and revenue expenses, a practice
presently followed by NTPC. It was consequently agreed during negotiations
P 



-32-
that the Bank Loan for the proposed Project would be onlent to NTPC by GOI in
accordance with an acceptable Subsidiary Loan Agreement as a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank Loan. It was further agreed that the terms of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement would specify that Bank Loan disbursements be
onlent on a quarterly basis to NTPC, being paid in the first montt of the
quarter following the quarter in which GOI receives such disbursemt.. :s. The
terms would also provide for maturity in 20 years, including a grace period
of five years, and repayment of principal in equal semi-annual installments,
with interest payable on outstanding balances at not Less than 12.5% per
annum. This minimum onlending rate provides sufficient margin over the
current Bank rate of 9.29% to cover the foreign exchange risk which is borne
by the Government, and represents about 6% in real terms.
Audit
4.17    As required by the Manufacturing and other Companies (Auditor's
Report) Order, 1975 issued by the Company Law Board in terms of Section 227
(4A) of the Companies Act, 1956, the audit of NTPC's accounts is performed by
professional auditors appointed by the Company Law Board, on the recommenda-
tion of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The auditors are
normally members of the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The
auditors' report is subject to review and comment by the Auditor General of
India. For FYs'83 and '84 the appointed auditors were P.K. Maheshwari & Co.
and Goel, Garg & Co., both firms of Chartered Accountants. The audited
financial statements and auditors report for FY'83 and FY'84 were satisfac-
tory to the Bank. The auditor' s reports contained no substantive recommenda-
tions or adverse comments. As has been agreed in connection with previous
credits and loans, NTPC agreed during negotiations to submit to the Bank
audited financial statements within seven months of the end of the fiscal
year to which they relate, together with a certified reporr by the auditors,
and comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (para 6.03).
NTPC has complied with this undertaking for FY'84 and prior years.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Alternative
5.01    Principal energy resources in the Northern Region, where the proposed
Project will be located, are concentrated in its two extremities. A vast
hydro potential exists in the Himalayas, in the northwest, and there are
large coal reserves in the southeast, of which about 10 billion tons are
being developed to generate po.er in the Singrauli-Rihand complex (para
3.01). In contrast, the States of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in the
middle of the Northern Region do not have significant energy resources and it
is in these states that the major load centers are located, particularly in
and around the Union Territory of Delhi. Consequently, supply to these load
centers requires either high voltage transmission or transport of coal to
load center stations. Although reasons of system security and stability
dictate that there should be a proportion of power supplied by load center
stations, the core of the least cost development plan comprises mine mouth
stations and high voltage transmission. In 1982 CEA, assisted by HQI, car-
ried out long-term planning studies for the development o' the EHV transmis-
sion system for the region. Three options for system development were inves-
tigated: (i) expansion of the existing 400-kV network, (ii) introduction of a
higher AC grid at 735-kV, with initial operation at 400-kY, and (iii) a
combination of an AC-DC system. The analysis concluded that the AC-DC system,
the proposed Project, was the least-cost option. While in principle a com-
p-ehensive national transmission study, such as has been included with the
proposed Project, is desirable to confirm the optimality, this is not prac-
ticable given the timescale required for the study. The Bank is confident
that the geography of electricity supply and demand is such that a transmis-
sion line between Rihand and the Delhi region would still be a vital part of
any comprehensive plan and therefore, that the results of the previous
studies are robust. Present information also indicates that the potential
for gas-fired power generation in Delhi which has recently emerged as a
possibility, is limited by the availability of gas and is insufficient to
affect the desirability of the proposed Project.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.02    Although the Project is crucial to the development of the power
system in the Northern Region its benefit to consumers cannot be separated
from those of investments in generation, other transmission lires and dis-
tribution. Therefore, having established that the proposed Project forms
part of the least-cost expansion plan it is appropriate to carry out a
cost-benefit analysis on the entire plan in order to ensure that the expan-
sion envisaged is desirable. For this purpose a 'time-slice' of the Northern
Region's investment program, covering the period FY'85-FY'95, has been
analyzed. Capital costs of the investment program (covering generation,
transmission and distribution) together with incremental operating and fuel
costs are given in Annex 5.1. The benefits of the investment program relate



-34-
mainly to the incremental consumption which it makes possible 1/. A minimum
measure of benefit, which ignores consumer surpLus, can be derlived from the
revenue generated by the incr-mental sales. In the absence of adequate class
specific consumption conversion factors, the standard conversion factor
(estimated to be 0.8) has been applied to convert financial revenue into a
measure of economic benefit. On this basis the minimum internal economic
rate of return achieved by the program is 4%.
5.03    However, this estimate is more useful as a measure of the adequacy of
tariffs than of the economic merit of the investment program which includes
the proposed Project. The estimated minimum economic rate of return, 4Z, is
substantially less than the established opportunity cost of capital, and this
is indicative of the fact that tariffs to consumers are presently less than
LENC (para 1.05)21. In reality the program will confer benefits in excess of
those de?cribed above. There will be consumer surplus associated with the
incremental consumption and typically there will be other external benefits.
The severe shortages of power experienced at present, and expected for the
foreseeable future (para 1.10) suggest that consumers' willingness to pay
substantially exceeds present tariff levels.
5.04    In order to derive a more realistic estimate for the internal
economic rate of return of the program it is useful to impute a measure of
consumer surplus, at least for industrial and agricultural consumers. Their
willingness to pay will be related to the costs of autogeneration and diesel
pumping, which many consumers are observed to find economic when public
supply is not available. Annex 5.1 presents an estimate of diesel
autogeneration costs at Rs. 1.12/kWh. It would, however, be unreasonable to
assume that all consumers would be willing to pay this price for the whole of
their consumption from the public supply system. Therefore, as a conserva-
tive measure, it has been assumed that the consumer surplus attributable to
incremental sales can be derived from an average of the cost of autogenera-
tion and the prevailing tariff. Similarly for agricultural consumers the
1/ The program may also lead to benefits in terms of a reduction in the cost
of meeting existing demand, particularLy through fueL savings. However,
the energy deficit is such that by far the greater part of the output
available from plants in the program will lead to increased sales. Fur-
thermore, the existing plants do not .ave particularly high fuel costs
(being predominantly coal or hydro-electric). Therefore, fuel savings
resulting from the program are likely to be small and this element of the
benefits has therefore been ignored.
2/ It should be noted that although final consumers' tariffs are much less
than LRMC, analysis of NTPC's, and bulk tariffs suggest that they are in
line with LRMC.

equivalent cost of diesel pumping has been estimated at Rs. 2.21/kWh and
average willingness to pay has been estimated at halfway between the average
agricultural tariff and this alternative cost. This more realistic measure
of the benefit of consumption results in an internal economic rate of return
for the program of 13Z. However, it must again be stressed that this still
represents a lower bound estimate as domestic consumer surplus and other
external benefits, have still not been included.
Justification for Bank Involvement
5.05    The Bank would be supporting GOI's efforts to alleviate power
shortages and reduce transmission losses as the Project would add efficient
transmission capacity to evacuate power from the new thermal capacity being
constructed in the Singrauli-Rihand area to load centers in the middle of
the Northern Region. In addition the Bank's involvement would promote:
(a) the introduction into India of a new technology in power trans-
mission (HVDC) capable of evacuating large quantities of power
economically over long distances;
(b) the rational development of a national interconnected grid, by
ensuring sound planning of the grid through the transmission
study which is included with the Project;
:c) the mobilization of foreign exchange financing through bilateral
agencies and/or commercial/supplier's credits.

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01    During negotiations GOI agreed that CEA will undertake studies for
the formulation of a least-cost long-term (15-to 20-year) national power
transmission plan and to address issues pertaining to the institutional,
coomercial, operational and training aspects of the system at the State,
regional and national levels. The scope and terms of reference of the
studies will be prepared by CEA in collaboration with the Bank by B)ecember
31, 1985. The studies and the national power transmission plan will be
completed and the results reserved with the Bank by June 30, 1987 (para
3.07).
6.02    During negotiations the following issues were raised with COI and
NTPC, and satisfactory clarification, agreement or assurances were obtained
with regard to:
(a) revolving letters of credit which should be opened, by all
relevant NTPC customers, for an amount equivalent to one month's
purchases of power (para 4.04).
(b) reduction of NTPC's accounts receivable to a level not exceeding
the equivalent of two months' sales of power (para 4.04).
Cc) timetables to liquidate arrears in accounts receivable (para
4.04).
(d) annual rates of return on unrevalued net assets in operation
which should be not less than 7Z in FY'85 through FY'90, not
less than 9.5Z in FY'91 through FrjO5, and thereafter annual
rates of return at levels satisfactory to ensure the financial
viability of NTPC (para 4.08).
(e) interim bulk supply contracts which are outstanding for two SEBs
would be concluded and submitted to the Bank by August 31, 1985
(para 4.13).
(f) satisfactory final bulk supply contracts -which would be sub-
mitted to the Bank by March 31, 1986, and subsequent revisions
which wouLd similarly be submitted to the Bank for review (para
4.14).
6.03    During negotiations NTPC agreed to sbmit to the Bank, audited finan-
cial statements within seven months of the end of the fiscal year to which
they relate, together with a certified report by the auditors, and comments
of the Comptroller and Auditor Ceneral of India (para 4.17).

6.04    Subject to the foregoing, the proposed Project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$250 million_

BBMB to terminate the Muradnagar line.
These substations will be constructed in accordance with NTPC standards and
practices.l/
III.   HVDC Transmission Line 2/
Voltage Selection
Tne voltage in HVDC links ranges between + 450-kV and + 600-kV. Volt-
ages above or below these figures would require multi-condictor bundles either
because of excessive losses (below + 450-kV) or excessive corona (above +
600-kV).
1/ The salient features of the NTPC 400/220-AV substation have been described
in the Central Power Transmission Project SAR (Report No. 4293-IN) in Annex
13, Attachment 2.
21. About 20,000 MW HVDC links are now in operation around the world; 45,000
MW are expected for 1990. (Information provided at the "Conference Inter-
nationale des Grands Reseaux Electriques" - CIGRE, Paris, September 1984.

The selected voltage for the Project (+ 500-kV) is based on the
experience in previous projects in operation or under construction in the world
as illustrated here below with some examples:
- Intermountain (USA)        830 km       1600 MW, 1600 A, + 500-kV
- Itaipu (Brazil)            800 km      3150 MW, 2600 A, + 600-kV
- NR 2 (Canada)              800 km      2000 MW, 2000 A, + 500-kV
- NR 1 (Canada)              800 km       1690 MW, 1800 A, + 500-kV
- Inga-Shaba (Zaire)         1800 km      1120 MW, 1120 A, * 500-kY
Line Coafiguration
Bipriar lines with a horizontal configuration.
Towers
Self-supporting latticed steel towers, fabricated from structural steel
angle sections will be used.  All the components of the towers would be h.--dip
galvarised. Normally, the foilowing four types of towers would be used: (0) 'A'
type suspension straight run tangent towers for up to 2 degrees angle of devia-
tiov; (Hi) 'B' type tension towers for angles of deviation in the line up to 15
degrees, also to be used as anticascading tower; (iii) 'C' type tension towers
for angles of deviation in the line up to 30 degrees; and (iv) 'D' type tension
towers for angles of deviation in the line up to 60 degrees and also as dead-end
(terminal) towers.
In addition, special towers and foundations are envisaged for major
river and power line crossings and places where the right of way is restricted
or the terrain is particularLy difficult. The design of these towers and foun-
dations would be finalized after undertaking detailed soiL investigation and
route survey.
Conductor
Quadruple bundle of ACSR (Aluminum 4214.57mm + Steel 712.54mm) would be
used per pole to provide a power transfer capability of up to 1500 MW.
Earthwire and Lightning Protection
Two galvanized steel earthwire of size 713.66mm would be used for
shielding.

ANNEX 3.1
Page 4 of 6
Grounding
The tower footing resistance would be kept below 10 ohms so that the
maximu= number of flash overs do not exceed 2 per year. Standard and radial
counterpoises would be used whenver applicable to provide a tower footing resis-
tance of 10 ohms.
InsuLator dnd Hardware
Suspension string would nave a 'V' configuration. The whole assembly
would be designed for the load corresponding to an ultimate tension of 160-kV in
each subconductor i.e., a total of 640-kV. Anchor shackles would be designed to
accommodate tower strain plates.  High strength antifog DC disc insulators of
160-kV electricaL and mechanical strength would be used. The number of discs in
a 'V' string assembly would be 2 x 38 (320 x 170 mm). A zinc sleeve would be
povided at the cement pin interface of the disc. To protect the pin of the
insulator from corrosion. Other regulations, procedures and practices will be as
per the prevailing Indian practices and standards for EHV lines as given at
Section I above.
HVDC Terminals
The basic one line diagram of the HVDC convertor stations is enclosed
as Attachment 2. The terminal at Rihand would be connected by cwo 400-kV AC
feeders to the 400-kV AC substation at Rihand power station and the terminal
at Delhi by two 400-kV AC feeders to ti 400-kV AC substation at Muradnagar.
The salient details of the HVDC terminal equipment are given below:
Converter Transformers
The converter transformers would be th'ree phases or single phase units
appropriately connected. They would be designed to withstand the combined DC
and AC stresses that would be subjected to while in operation. They would have
appropriate number of taps as well as an ade-uate tap range so as to ensure
desired flexibility in the operation of the bipole.
Thyristor Valves
The EVDC converter stations would comprise one 12 pulse valve group per
pole which would be initially equipped for a nominal continuous rating of 1000
MW in bipolar operation but which would be upgradable at a later date to 1500
MW. The multiple valve units would be water-cooled and will be the indoor air
insulated type. They would be of modular design comprising different thyristor
levels of identical construction. They will be triggered by optically
instigated electrical firing, separately light triggered thyristor firing or
direct optical firing. Each valve would be protected against overLoad, over
voltage, and other variations in current and voltage.

Smoothing Reactor
The DC smoothing reactors would be designed for limiting the over cur-
rent phenomena during the invertor voltage collapse and for smoothing the DC
voltage/current during normal operations.
Surge Arrestors
The AC and DC surge arrestors would be of the metal oxide type because
it has generally been established that metaL oxide surge arrestors with their
definitive characteristics are more appropriate for DC applications. Hence,
parts of the AC system contiguous to the HVDC systems (e.g. 400-kV AC coimnutat-
ing bus) would also be equipped with this type of arrestor. Each arrestor would
have discharge characteristics and ratings as is required for that particuLar
application. The arrestors would be designed to give consistent protection to
their associated equipment against over voltages produced by lighting, switch-
ing, internal or external faults and other system disturbances. Each arrestor
would be provided with a surge counter and Leakage current meter for monitoring
purposes.
AC Harmonic Filters
AC harmonic filters would be used to filter out undesirable characteris-
tics and non-characteristic harmonics generated as a result of the conversion
process and minimize their entry into the AC network thereby minimizing over
voltages, resonance effects and electromagnetic noise generation and inter-
ference. The AC harmonic filter would also supply most of the reactive energy
required by the convertor equipment. The filters would comprise of linear shunt
capacitors and reactors arranged in suitable groups and banks.
DC Filters
DC filters would be used to reduce the noise on the DC line generated
as a result of the harmonics generated during the conversion process. They
would be composed of capacitor, resistor and reactor elements.
DC Measuring Devices
DC voltage measuring devices would be of the resistor divider type with
an accuracy of not less than 1%. The resistors would be of the metal film type,
deposited on a suitable ceramic base. DC current measuring devices would be of
the transductor type and wouLd have an accuracy of not less than + 2% for up to
normal full load current.

400-kV AC Switchgear
All AC side equipment would be the 400-kV AC equipment as described at
Section rIi above.
Auxiliary Power
Adequate power supplies from the 11-kV boards at Rihand power station
and 11/6.6-kV boards at Muradnagar station, would be provided. In addition all
protective interlocks, relays, controls and critical illumination would operate
on 220-V/48-V DC fed by battery banks and charges. A standby diesel generator
for running fire pumps, illumination lamps etc., in an emergency would be
installed.
Buildings
All buildings would be as per the relevant Indian Building codes.
However, the main convertor building housing the EVDC valves would have a spe-
cial electro-magnetic screen to reduce Radio Interference as well as electros-
tatic shielding to limit the exposure of personnel to specified electric field
strengths.
Service Facilities
Service facilities such as water treatment, sewerage, sanitation,
purification, fire fighting, oil filtration and fire fighting and repair
workshops would generally as per the service facilities described at Section
II above.

(h)  Capital Requirements
(i) The proposed Bank loan would be made directly to NTPC for a
20 year term with GOI guarantee, principal repayments in equal
annual installments over 15 years (subsequent to a 5 year
period of grace), and at an interest rate of 10.08Z per annum.
(ii)  Other capital requirements would met by NTPC's internal cash
generation combined with GOI advances in the form of equity and
share capital subject to the condition that unpaid loans, at the
end of each year, does not exceed share capital and retained
earnings. Equity capital advances would preceed GOI loan
funding.
(iii) GOI loans (including the onlending of previously approved
credits and loans) are assumed to finance projects included
in NTPC's investment program. Interest on Loans up
to the date of commissioning of each unit of plant, would be
charged to construction (capitalized), while subsequent interest
accrued would be charged to Revenue. Repayment of principal
is assumed in 30 semi-annual installments commencing on the

NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Commercial Arrangements for Sale of NTPC Power
1.01    The Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) received for SEB's of the
Northern (Singrauli) Region, and SEB's of the Western (Korba) Region
represent interim agreements between NTPC and the relevant SEBs for the sale
of power.  The MOU contracts expire on March 31, 1985 for the Northern Region
and March 31, 1986 for the Western Region, or when replaced by revised bulk
supply contracts, whichever occurs earlier.  Although the MOU's defined most
of the factors, terms and conditions considered by the Bank to be required
in order to be satisfactory, clarifications wers sought, during negotiations
for Loan 2442-IN, concerning the validity of the contracts after their
expiration dates, provision for a capacity charge, provision for NTPC
profits, and the calculation of the flat tariff rates. During negotiations
GOI and NTPC provided satisfactory clarification on these points. The Indian
delegation provided a copy of a legal opinion verifying that the interim
contracts (MOU's) will remain legaLly valid and binding after their
expiration date and until replaced be revised contracts. They also provided
details of calculation of the interim flat rate tariffs clarifying that the
rates included correctly, all factors which were of concern to the Bank,
which included a NTPC profit component of 10Z on NTPC equity, and loan
interest at the GOI onlending rate (currently 13.5X). It was also clarified
that the interim contracts include provision for a commitment (capacity)
charge, which is not at present recovered as a separate element in the
tariff, but is covered by the overall variable tariff rate. The Indian
delegation expLained that at the present stage of deveLopment, the
inter-state transmission systems had not advanced to the point where NTPC
could ensure supply of the SEBs' agreed power allocations. Owing to the
contractual financial penalities of non-supply of allocated power, which are
a part of the commitment charge provision, it was considered premature at
that stage for NTPC to biLl SEBs for power sales on the basis of a two-tier
tariff (fixed commitment charge plus variable energy charge).
1.02    Contracts have not yet been received for the Southern Region
(Ramagundam) or for the Eastern Region (Farakka) which were due in May 1983
and July 1984 respectively. As the Bank mission emphasized during previous
missions, and during appraisal of the proposed project, satisfactory
contractual agreements between NTPC and the relevant SEBs for the sale of
power are essential to ensure the financial viability of NTPC. Submission
to the Bank of signed contracts for the States of the Eastern and Southern
Regions was made a condition of effectiveness for Loan 2442-IN. At the



-73-
ANNEX 4.9
Page 2 of 2
request of GOI, the Bank has recently extended the date of loan effectiveness
to May 6, 1985. During negotiations for Loan 2442-IN, GOI and NTPC agreed to
provide to the Bank revised bulk supply contracts for all four Regions, by
March 31, 1986, incorporating the following provisions:
(a) Provision for periodic renewal of the contracts
beyond the initial validity period;
(b)  At the time of renewal, replacement, or extension of
the contracts, but in any event at not more than
three-year intervals, revision, where required, of the
tariffs and the factors for their calculation to
ensure recovery of NTPC's operating costs and loan
interest, and generation of a satisfactory level of
net income;
(c)  Provision that a commitment (capacity) charge be introduced
at a time considered appropriate by NTPC; and
(d)  Definition of the NTPC profit component of the tariffs.
1.03    In respect to power transfers to SEB's outside of a particular
Region, the sales of NTPC power will be priced at the bulk supply tariff rate
of the receiving region for sales within the committed power allocation of
the relevant SEB. Where sales are in excess of the committed allocation, rhe
tariff rate of the generating region would apply to that portion in excess of
the committed allocation.
1.04    NTPC bulk supply contracts establish regional tariffs for NTPC power
sales in eash respective region.  Operating costs applicable to the
transmission facilities of the Central Power Transmission Project and the
proposed project will be absorbed by the relevant regional NTPC
organizations. Recovery of such costs, therefore, are reflected in the
regional tariffs as a separate component of these tariffs. The bulk supply
contracts provide for an automatic monthly adjustment to current fuel prices.

RIHAND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Internal Economic Rate of Return
As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an integral
part of the expansion plan for the Northern Region and, therefore,
cost-benefit analysis needs to be carried out on the whole program rather
than on the Project in isolation. The Northern Region's investment program
during the period FY'85-FY'95 has, therefore, been analyzed. Capital cost,
incremental operation and maintenance, incremental fuel cost and benefit
streams are all shown in Table 1. Assumptions underlying these figures are
detailed beLow.
Capital Costs
Anticipated capital expenditure on generation at financial prices has
been converted to economic prices by (i) expressing the imported content at
cif prices; (ii) valuing unskilled local labor at 0.75 of the market wage
rate; and (iii) applying the estimated standard conversion factor, 0.8, to
local costs. Transmission and distribution capital expenditures have been
estimated at 40% of generation expenditure.
Operation and Maintenance Costs
Incremental annual operating and maintenance costs have been
estimated as the following percentages of capital value: thermal generating
plant 2.52, hydroelectric 1.13X, and transmission and distribution 1.0%
Fuel Costs
Incremental fuel costs arise only from coal-fired thermal plant
included in the Region's investment program. Average fuel consumption of
new coal-fired plant has been estimated at 0.61 kg of coal/kWh plus 0.015
liter/kWh of fuel oil at Rs. 2.8 per Liter, the latter being required for
flame stabilization. The economic cost of coal at the pit head has been
estimated at Is 172/ton. It has been estimated that 65Z of incremental
thermal generation will be in minemouth stations and 35% will be in load
center stations. The average economic cost of coal delivered to load center
stations has been estimated at Rs 350/ton.
Case 1. Benefits
Case 1. benefits are based solely on incremental revenue at existing
tariff levels. Incremental sales attributable to the investment program are



-75-
ANNEX 5.1
Page 2 of 4
shown in Table 1. These allow for system Losses which are assumed to remain
constant at 20% of net, generation. The average existing tariff is estimated
to be Rs. 0.46/kWh which, after applying the v:andard conversion factor of
0.8, corresponds to an economic value of revenue of Rs. 0.37/kWh.
Case 2. Benefits
In Case 2, the benefits of incremental consumption include eLements
of consumers' surplus for both industrial and agricultural consumers.
Surplus has been imputed at half of the difference between the average
tariff, and the alternative cost of autogeneration for industrial consumers
and diesel pumping for agricultural.
The cost of industriaL autogeneration has been estimated as follows:
Purchase price (incl. installation)        Rs 4,300/kW
Life of set                                  15 years
Average utilization                            30%
Discount rate                                  12%
Operation and maintenance cost             Rs 215/kW per annum
Fuel and lubricant                         Rs 0.80/kWh
Average cost                               Rs 1.12/kWh
The cost of electricity which would make electrical pumping equiv-
alent to diesel is calculated as follows:

Average industrial and agricultural financial tariffs in the Northern
region are estimated at Rs. 0.54/kWh and Rs. 0.21/kWh respectively.
Estimated willingness to pay, cnnverted into economic terms at a standard
conversion factor of 0.8, is therefore Rs. 0.66/kWh for industrial and Rs.
0.97/kid'  for agricultural.  Combining these with revenue estimates of the
benefit to other consumers gives an average benefit of Rs. 0.72/kWh in
economic terms.
