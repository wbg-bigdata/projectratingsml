                                    RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY


1.     The proposed changes are: (i) reduction of project scope since some of the works no
longer need Bank financing; (ii) restructuring of the financing plan and disbursement
arrangements due to increasing costs and appreciation of Chinese RMB; and, (iii) revision of
monitoring indicators and results framework to reflect the restructured components.


B. PROJECT STATUS


2.      The project was approved by the Board on June 27, 2006, and the legal documents were
signed on September 1, 2006. The closing date is June 30, 2013. As of September 30, 2012, the
project costs amount to about RMB 645.69 or 29% of the overall current costs, which include
civil works, goods, consultancies, land acquisition, resettlement and overheads. The total Bank
loan disbursement is US$ 64.91 million, or 43% of the total amount.


3.      The original project design included 73 civil works contracts under Component 1 (Water
Supply) and Component 2 (Wastewater Management). These 73 civil works contracts include 35
contracts for the construction of water supply treatment plants (including well fields or water
intake structures), four for the construction of wastewater treatment plants, and 34 for the
construction of water distribution networks (including eight for the construction of sewer
collection networks but combined with that of water distribution networks for the convenience of
construction). At this time, 42 civil works contracts under Component 1 (including two sewer
collection networks combined with the construction of water distribution networks) and only one
separated contract for the construction of sewer collection networks under Component 2 remain
under the project.

4.      The remaining 30 civil works contracts – 26 for the construction of water treatment
plants, water distribution networks, and sewer collection networks, under Component 1 and
Component 2, and four for the construction of wastewater treatment plants under Component 2 –
have already been financed by the government and private sector, with over half of the contracts
thereof being either started or even completed prior to the loan effectiveness, and therefore do
not require Bank financing anymore. As a result, the loan saving totals about US$ 44 million.
However, the inflation and appreciation of RMB against the US Dollar from 8.1:1 to 6.3:1 have
put pressure on counterpart funding resources. Therefore, the Borrower requested to reallocate
the loan savings to the remaining counties to make sure they would have adequate funding.

PDO


5.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) will be made consistent with the one in the
Loan Agreement and read: "The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower’s Henan
Province in expanding its water supply and wastewater management services and improving the
institutional capacity of relevant institutions to plan, regulate and operate such services".


Results/indicators


6.     Since half of the works were dropped from the project, the target values for Indicators 1
and 2 that are directly linked to Component 1 and 2 have been adjusted. Indicator 3, “Aggregate
population growth of the participating towns?, has been dropped, since the project is providing
water and wastewater services only to small towns and is not fostering the growth of these
towns. The adjusted Results Framework and Monitoring is presented in Annex 1.

Project Scope

7.     Component 1. The current scope of Component 1 includes: (i) the construction of water
supply facilities in 34 counties within 12 municipalities, with a total capacity of around 790,000
m3/day; and (ii) the installation of 2,400 km of water distribution networks, including user
connections and installation of meters.

8.      After restructuring, the project will support only 20 counties within 9 municipalities. The
total capacity of project financed water supply facilities will be about 465,000 m 3/day; and about
1,512 km of water distribution networks will be installed, including user connections and
installation of meters.

9.       Component 2. The current scope of Component 2 includes the installation of more than
440 km of wastewater pipelines in 11 counties within 8 municipalities; and wastewater treatment
facilities in 5 counties within 4 municipalities for a total capacity of about 105,000 m3/day
capacity.

10.    As result of the restructuring, the remaining works will install 194.2 km of wastewater
pipelines in 6 counties within 6 municipalities. No wastewater treatment facilities will be
financed under the project.

11.     Project Costs. Since half of the contracts have been dropped the total project costs have
been reduced. The revised project costs is estimated at US$ 208.4 million or about 69% of
original estimated project costs. The following table presents the project costs before and after
restructuring.

12.    Financing Plan. As a result of the reduced project costs, the financing plan has also been
revised as follows:

                           Source                   Current       After Restructuring

                            Total                   302.62               208.36




13.    Disbursement arrangements. Due to inflation, the costs of water distribution networks
have increased by 10% on average, and water production facilities increased by 18% on average.
The combination of inflation and appreciation of RMB against US Dollar puts the pressure on
the counterpart funding resources. Therefore, the Borrower requested to reallocate the Bank loan
savings to the remaining works and modify the disbursement arrangements to include a new
category (Goods) for office equipment. Accordingly, after the restructuring, the utilization of
loan proceeds is estimated as follows:
