APPRAISAL OF THE EIGHTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
(NICARAGUA-HONDURAS INTERCONNECTION)
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LUZ Y FUERZA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Eighth Power Project of
the Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) of Nicaragua, an autonomous
Government corporation responsible for the supply of practically all public
power in Nicaragua. ENALUF has requested assistance from the Bank and the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) in jointly financing
the project. Because the project involves interconnection with the power
system of Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) of Honduras, this
report is related to the appraisal of the Fifth Power Project of ENEE.
ii.       The cost of the project is estimated to be US$34.7 million.  The
Bank would provide a loan of US$24 million and CABEI, US$6.1 million. The
Bank loan would finance US$20.4 million (about 85%) of the foreign exchange com-
ponent of the project and US$ 2.1 milion interest during construction.  CABEI
would finance the balance - US$3.6 million (about 15%)- of the foreign exchange
component, US$2 million of the local cost and US$0.5 million of interest on
its own loan.
iii.      The proposed Bank loan would also cover the foreign exchange part,
amounting to US$1.5 million, of cost overruns resulting from unexpected geo-
logical problems with the Santa Barbara hydro project, which is currently
being completed; Loan 543-NI has been fully drawn down.
iv.       The Bank, since 1953, has assisted in financing practically all
of ENALUF's expansion in generation and transmission through seven loans,
totaling US$42.3 million. The Seventh Project will be completed by the
middle of 1972. All projects are operating satisfactorily. The United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), through ENALUF, has
assisted Nicaragua since 1969 in financing a large program of village
electrification.
v.        The Project includes:
a)   a new 100 MW steam-electric station at Puerto Somoza on the
Pacific coast,and associated 230 kV transmission facilities;
b)   a 230 kV interconnection with the system of ENEE to provide
for the interchange of large blocks of power between Nicaragua
and Honduras;
c)   a 138 kV transmission ring around Managua, the capital of
Nicaragua, and an extension of the present 138 kV system to
the north of the country; and



- ii -
d)   management consultant services to further improve ENALUF's
organization and administration.
vi.       Honduras has an abundance of attractive hydroelectric sites
whose potential capacity far exceeds the nation's current demand for
power. The interconnection component of the project would permit trans-
fers of thermal energy from Nicaragua to Honduras from 1975 through 1977;
from 1978 onwards the interconnection would be expected to provide
Nicaragua with large amounts of Honduran hydroelectric power. The most
promising hydro project in Honduras is El Cajon,from which Nicaragua
would obtain power at lower cost than from the thermal plants it would
have to install if Honduran hydroelectric power could not be imported.
vii.      Because ENALIF will be selling power to ENEE initially, its
current capital requirements are larger than they would be without inter-
connection. Subsequently the situation will be reversed, ENALUF1s
capital requirements will be smaller, and ENEE's larger, because of the
construction of El Cajon.
viii.     Consultants would carry out the design and construction super-
vision of the project.
ix.       Procurement would follow the Bank's Guidelines.  Manufacturers
from Central American Common Market countries would be given a preference
of either 15% of the CIF price or 50% of the import duty, whichever is
lower. The project is expected to be completed by early 1976.
X.        ENALTJF's financial position and earnings are satisfactory and
are expected to remain so.
xi.       With the agreements reached,the project is a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$24 million equivalent with a term of 24 years
including four and one half years of grace.



APPRAISAL OF THE EIGHTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
(NICARAGUA-HONDURAS INTERCONNECTION)
ENPRESA NACIONAL DE LUZ Y FUERZA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) of Nicaragua
has requested a Bank loan jointly with the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI) to assist in financing its 1972-1976 expan-
sion program. A loan of US$24 million is proposed to cover part of the
foreign exchange cost of the project, the total cost of which is about
US$34.7 million. The loan would be made to ENALUF with guarantee of the
Republic of Nicaragua, for a period of 24 years, including a grace period
of four and one half years. A CABEI loan of US$6.1 million would cover the
balance of the foreign exchange cost and some of the local cost (see para-
graphs 7.13 and 7.14 for details).  Both loans would also cover interest dur-
during construction covering approximately the 1972-1974 period, limited
to respectively US$2.1 million and US$0.5 million. Disbursements from the
proposed Bank loan and by CABEI would be made on a 85/15% basis.
1.02      The proposed project, which was appraised simultaneously with
the Fifth Power Project of Enpresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE)
of Honduras, would include the Nicaraguan part of an interconnection
between the two countries and sufficient thermal capacity not only to
meet Nicaraguan requirements up to 1978, but in addition some of Honduras'
requirements. Because ENALUF will be supplying power to ENEE, ENALUF's
current capital requirements are larger, and ENEE's smaller, than they
would be without interconnection. In the next phase of the development
program, this situation is expected to be reversed.
1.03      The proposed loan would also cover the US$1.5 million foreign
exchange part of cost overruns on the Santa Barbara hydroelectric project
(Loan 543-NI) currently being completed. Excavating highly fractured
rock resulted in a larger than expected overbreak in the tunnel which re-
quired more supports than estimated. The dam also had to be relocated
because of unforeseen foundation conditions. The additional cost of this
project is now estimated at about US$4.5 million above the original cost
estimate of US$21.8 million. ENALUF is covering the US$3.0 million of
local expenditure overrun from its own resources.
1.04      The Bank has made seven loans to ENALUF since 1953, aggregating
US$42.3 million, which have assisted in financing practically all of ENALUF's
expansion in generation and transmission (see Annex 1). All projects have
been completed and are operating satisfactorily, except for 138 kV trans-
mission facilities associated with Santa Barbara which are expected to be
substantially completed by June 1972.
1.05      This report is based on feasibility studies prepared by ENALUF's
consultants, Electroconsult (ELC) of Italy and Kuljian Engineers/Contractors
(Kuljian) of the U.S. and on information supplied by ENALUF and'ENEE during
an appraisal by Messrs. W. F. Kiipper and V. Nercissiantz, who visited
Nicaragua in October 1971 and February 1972. They cooperated closely with
Messrs. Hui Huang and John E. Graves who appraised ENEE's project.

2. THE POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      About 90% of Nicaragua's  2  million inhabitants live on the
fertile Pacific Slope of the country, which constitutes less than 30%
of its area of 148,000 km2. The country's economy depends primarily
on the exports of bananas, coffee and cotton and, as a consequence, its
economy, and demand for power, are sensitive to weather conditions and
to variation in supply and demand in the international markets for these
crops. In 1967-1969 Nicaragua suffered downswings in economic activity,
but in 1970-1971 economic activity resumed. GDP per capita is currently
estimated to be about US$435.
2.02      Although an industrial latecomer in the Central American Common
Market (CACM), development of industry has been quite brisk and industrial
power requirements have risen correspondingly, this being one of the main
reasons for ENALUF's rapid expansion through the sixties (see Annex 6).
Sales for commercial and industrial purposes, representing 4C% of all
electricity produced in the country in 1965, rose to 54% in 1970.
Characteristics of the Sector
2.03      Practically all of the electricity supplied to the public in
Nicaragua is generated and distributed by ENALUF. There are still some
30 small private companies and municipal entities, but in the next three
years practically all of these are expected to be absorbed by ENALUF or
merged into distribution cooperatives which are now being created (see
paragraph 2.05). Industry operated about 28% of the installed capacity in
1970, but as ENALIF continues to expand the relative importance of captive
plant will decrease. In 1970 installed capacity and annual generation was
as listed below.

2.o4      In 1970 about 30% of the population was being provided with elec-
tricity and at the present rate of expansion about 40% will be supplied
by 1975. Per capita generation, 245 kWh in 1970, is the second highest
Central America:

Honduras                                            116
2.05      In 1969 ENALUF undertook to set up a system of three cooperatives
for an ambitious program of village electrification costing US$15.5 million,
for which the US Agency for International Development (USAID) provided a
loan of US$10.2 million, the Government made grante totaling C$22 million
(US$3.2 million) and ENALUF would provide C$14.8 million (US$2.1 million),
most of it in kind. ENALTJF is obliged to supervise procurement and the
erection of equipment and to train technical and administrative person-
nel for the cooperatives. The three cooperatives are expected to be con-
nected to ENALUF's system this year. In 1971 a fourth cooperative was
added to the program, scheduled for completion in 1974, for which USAID
made a loan of US$4.3 million, the Government is granting about C$8 million
(US$1.1 million) and for which ENALUF would provide, most of it in kind,
C$8.8 million (US$1.3 million). The total funds and interest during con-
struction are being relent to the cooperatives on terms similar to the
USAID terms, i.e., for a period of 35 years, including a grace period of
10 years and an interest rate of 2.5%. ENALUF as debtor to USAID will
carry the debt service responsibility, but the actual funds for the debt
service payments will come from the cooperatives. ENALUF is permitted to
retain as an additional equity contribution that portion of the cooperatives'
debt service payments which corresponds to the Government grants. The
Government will contribute, should it be necessary, any additional funds and
services that ENALUF may need to bring the program to a successful conclusion.
2.06      Upon completion of the network for the fourth cooperative in 1974,
ENALUF would be meeting all public electricity requirements through an inte-
grated system covering the Pacific Slope. It is estimated that by 1974 about
23,000 cooperative consumers (about 10% of total consumers) will be served
by a network having a length of about 2000 km, and would constitute a demand
of some 18 MW and annual sales of about 45 GWh.
2.07      Although an inventory is being made of Nicaragua's hydro resources,
the identification of major sites is in its early stages and for the next
decade ENALUF's requirements will have to be met mainly by thermal plants,
unless it is able to import hydro power from its neighbors, Honduras and
Costa Rica. The interconnection to be financed by the proposed loan would
permit such importation from Honduras (see paragraph 3.01).
ENALUF's Facilities
2.08      ENALUF's 1972 generating capacity of 198 MW in its central,



-4-
integrated 138 kV, system is made up as follows:
MW
Diesel                            13
Gas Turbine                       15
Steam                             70
Hydro                            100
Total                            198
ENALUF's generating facilities, and the Bank loans that assisted in fi-
nancing most of them, are shown in Annex 1. Under the various Bank loans,
distribution facilities were extended and a 138 kV transmission system
was constructed.
2.09      ENALUF also owns and operates six small independent systems
(with aggregate installed capacity of 10 MW), four on the Pacific Slope
and two on the Atlantic Coast. The four on the Pacific Slope will be
absorbed by the cooperatives. The two Atlantic Coast systems will re-
main isolated but their generating capability will be supplemented by
transferring to them some of the newer diesels from the Pacific Slope.
2.10      Historical demand, generation and sales for ENALUF's central
system are shown in Annex 5. The annual increase in generation, which
averaged an impressive 23% from 1958 (the first year of central system
operation) to 1966, declined to a still substantial 14% for the period
1966-1971. The load factor increased from 54% in 1966 to about 65% in
1971 (which may be somewhat overstated due to peak hour lowering of volt-
age during the recent dry years). Maximum demand for the period 1966-
1971 increased from 56 MW to 92 MW or about 11% annually. ENALUF present-
ly has about 80,000 customers.
Geothermal Development
2.11      For some years ENALUF has been investigating the possibilities of
geothermal developments, and preliminary explorations in the neighborhood
of the Mcmotombo volcano have established that favorable steam conditions
exist. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is financing a
feasibility study of this development in which the Bank has expressed
"special interest". The conditions appear to be similar to the Ahuachapan
geothermal field in El Salvador, an attractive site now being developed.
It is probable that a 30 MW geothermal plant will be justified for the
early 1980's when ENALUF's additional generation requirement can not be
met from El Cajon.



- 5 -
3. INTERNATIONAL INTERCONNECTION
3.01      Technically and economically, the most attractive of the many
undeveloped hydroelectric sites in Honduras is at El Cajon, where a
capacity of 450 MW or more could be installed to generate an average of
about 1,300 GWh annually at low cost (about 6.4 US mills per kwh).
3.02      ENEE's maximum demand (51 MW in 1971) is about half of ENALUF's
maximum demand (92 MW in 1971) and the Honduras market would not be suf-
ficiently large to absorb El Cajon's potential until the mid-1980s.
3.03      A high-voltage interconnection between the two systems would
therefore benefit both. By providing a larger market for power from El
Cajon, it would enable ENEE to develop this site sooner than would other-
wise be economically feasible. Prior to the completion of El Cajon, the
link would enable ENEE to obtain power from ENALJUF, thereby minimizing
ENEE's immediate need for new generating facilities. With El Cajon
completed, ENALUF would be provided with large amounts of low-cost hydro
power through the mid-1980s, thus permitting Nicaragua to invest less in
generation and incur operating costs lower than they would otherwise have
been.
3.04      ENALUF's system would be extended from Leon to the border by a
230 kV line, about 70 km long, to meet a similar line which ENEE would
construct as part of its Fifth Power Project (see maps of Nicaragua
and Hondures). Interconnection at 230 kV is the best technical and
economic voltage for the distances involved and the amounts of power
to be transmitted.
3.05      As part of the proposed project, ENALTUF would build a new steam
power station at Puerto Somoza with two 50 MW units to be commissioned by
the end of 1974 and 1975, respectively. These units would enable ENALUF,
in addition to meeting its own load growth, to supply ENEE from the end
of 1974, when the interconnection would be completed, until El Cajon is
commissioned in 1978, with energy which would have a lower cost of production
than any ENEE could provide itself. ENEE, under its Fifth Power Project,
would construct a new 24 MW diesel electric station, i.e., only
about 50% of the additional capacity which would be required without inter-
connection between now and 1978. The supply of power from ENALUF would be
sufficient not only to supply ENEE's incremental requirements but also to
allow ENEE to place its old diesel facilities on standby for most of this
period and thereby reduce fuel costs.
3.06      With El Cajon completed, all of ENEE's thermal facilities would
be put on standby and ENALUF's thermal generation would also be greatly
reduced, thereby permitting further savings of fuel for both utilities.
3.07      Even if El Cajon were not completed as currently projected, the
interconnection would still benefit both utilities by reducing their
operating costs and investment programs (as detailed in paragraph 5.06).



- 6 -
3.08      As indicated in Annex 6, which describes the feasibility study
of the interconnection as carried out by ELC and modified by the two
utilities, each system's firm capability (installed capacity less
capacity of the largest unit in the system) would be able to meet at
least 79% of its peak demand in case of interruption of the interconriec-
tion, which is acceptable.
Legal Aspects and Power Contract
3.09      Both Nicaragua and Honduras have agreed that it is necessary
for the two countries to conclude a treaty which will allow the inter-
connection and the interchange of power and also authorize the two companie
to negotiate a power contract for the interchange. The treaty has already
been signed but not yet ratified. Both countries' legislative bodies will
ratify the treaty before disbursements will be made from the loan in respect
of those parts of the Project directly related to the interconnection, i.e.,
all of the 230 kV transmission lines and the 230/138 kV substations at
Tiscapa and Leon.
3.10      The two utilities are expected to sign, early in June, a contract
satisfactory to the Bank for the supply of power from Nicaragua to Honduras
during the first years after interconnection. No disbursement will be made
from the loan in respect of those parts of the Project directly related to
the interconnection until this contract becomes effective. The supply of
El Cajon power from Honduras to Nicaragua will be the subject of another
contract, to be negotiated after the completion of the feasibility study,
when the cost of the power plant and of its energy will be better known.

4. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
ENALUF's Expansion Program
4.01      ENALUF's program for the next five years would comprise, in
addition to the project (below), the completion of the transmission for
the Santa Barbara project (Loan 543-NI),expansion of distribution net-
works, a large program of village electrification, and studies for
future geothermal and hydroplants. This program covers the period 1972-
1976, by the end of which the project would be completed. The loan would be
fully drawn down in early 1977. The estimated total cost of the program
is C$417 million (US$60 million equivalent).
Description of the Project
4.02      The two maps show the facilities to be executed in both countries
under the respective projecta. The project for Nicaragua (see Annex 2 for
full description) would include:
-    a 100 MW steam-electric station at Puerto Somoza on the
Pacific Coast;
-    a 230 kV transmission system to connect the Puerto Somoza
station to ENALUF's system and to the system of ENEE of
Honduras;
-    a 138 kV ring around Managua, the capital of Nicaragua;
-    a 138 kV line to extend ENALUFts service area in the
northern part of the country; and,
-   management consultants' services to assist ENALUF in im-
proving its organization and administration.
Cost of the Project
4.03      The estimated cost of the project is C$242.6 million (US$34.7
million), as ahown in the following table. A more detailed breakdown of
cost is shown in Annex 3 and details of the financing plan are discussed
in paragraphs 7.12 through 7.24.

To finance project preparation.
}4.04     The cost estimates for the Puerto Somoza steam-electric plant are
based on Kuljian's estimates reflecting recent contract prices for similar
plants around the world. ELC prepared the cost estimates for the 230 kV 2nd
138 kV transmission systems. The estimates have been adjusted to reflect
the revaluation of other currencies with respect to the US dollar. To cover
increases in cost due to unforeseen difficulties which might arise during
the construction of the project, a physical contingency allowance
of about 8% has been included for local costs and 7% for foreign costs. An
allowance of 4.5% of the local and foreign exchange cost has heen added to
cover possible price increases.
Engineering and Construction
4.0o5     Engineering design and supervision of construction of the Puerto
Somoza plant and for the 230 kV transmission facilities to connect this
plant to the existing 138 kV facilities at Leon and Managua would be carried
out by Kuljian. Electroconsult would design and supervise the construction
of the 230 kV interconnection facilities both in Nicaragua and Honduras under
two similar contracts, one to be signed with ENALUF and one with ENEE. Under
a separate contract Electroconsult would design and supervise the construction
of the extensions to ENALUF's 138 kV facilities. ENALUF has agreed to continue
to employ consultants acceptable to the Bank and CABEI, for engineering and
supervision of its major facilities.



-9-_
Procurements and Disbursements
4.o6      All contracts for the works to be financed from the proposed
loan (except consultants' services) would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding consistent with the Bank Guidelines and CABEI's
procurement rules. In the light of the Central American Agreement on
Fiscal Incentives to Industrial Development (1969), manufacturers from the
Central American Common Market (CACM) would be allowed a preference of
either 15% of the CIF price or 50% of the import duty, whichever is the lower.
The items for which CACM countries could be competitive under this arrange-
ment include cement, reinforcing steel, fuel, tires, conductors, cable, and
welding rods; the total cost of these items to be procured for the project
is not expected to exceed U $0.1 million equivalent.
4.07      On the basis of the proposed joint "85/15" financing plan, the
Bank would control disbursements for the CIF cost of imported equipment and
of the foreign exchange cost of services. The Bank would act on behalf of
CABEI in reviewing and processing all withdrawal applications substantiated
by supporting documentation and will disburse its 85% share and notify CABEI
to pay its 15% share. (US$660,000 for engineering services are being financed by
CABEI under a separate loan and would not be eligible for payment from the
Loan Account.) In addition (and outside of the 85/15% cost-sharing with
C.ABEI), the Bank would also disburse against civil works and equipment
contracts up to US$ 1.5 million to cover the foreign expenditures for Santa
Barbara cost overruns. US$2.1 million will finance interest and other
charges on the Bank loan. ENALJUF would be reimbursed retroactively for (i)
payments made on contracts for the Santa Barbara project subsequent to the
complete draw down of Loan 543-NT on May 17, 1972, and (ii) payments not
exceedii±g US$100,000 made for the services of engineering consultants for
the transmission facilities after March 1, 1972. Annex 4 shows the estimated
quarterly disbursements for the proposed loan. The project is expected to
be completed by early 1976; the closing date would be March 31, 1977.
Project Supervision
4.08       The Bank and CABEI will have joint responsibility for project
supervision and CABEI staff will participate in Bank suPerviSiOn visits.
Errvironm8nt
4.09      The Puerto Somoza plant will be located on the Pacific Coast in
a sparsely inhabited area and sea water will be used for cooling purposes.
No environmental problems are expected. Bunker C oil will be used as fuel
and no means of cleaning exhaust gases would be installed. However,
sufficient space will be provided to install such facilities if they are
necessary in the future.

5. JUSTIFICATION
Forecast of Sales and Demand
5.01      ENALUF's sales to Nicaraguan consumers are expected to increase
by an average of about 13% per annum from 1971 through 1976 (see Annexes 5
and 6). This relatively high growth rate is due in part to connection of
the new cooperatives and to an increase expected in industrial requirements.
Honduras would take some 110 GWh in 1975 increasing to 260 GWh in 1977.
As a consequence, ENALUF's overall growth rate for the period 1971 through
1976 would be about 21% per annum. The central system's load factor would
average about 61% for the period prior to interconnection, and 58% dLring
1975-1977, due to ENEE's lower system load factor. Maximum demand, includ-
ing power supply to Honduras is expected to increase at about 21% per year
to 230 MW by 1976 i.e., to 2.5 times the 1971 demand of 92 MW.
5.02      Annex 5 shows ENALUF's forecast of sales, gross generation and
maximum demand, together with the capacity required, capacity available,
plant additions, and a schedule of additions of generating capacity by type
of plant.
Interconnection
5.03      The proposed interconnection, while of itself not contributing to
the revenues of either company, will enable them to reduce, or postpone,
investments which would otherwise be required to meet their respective fore-
cast market requirements with the same degree of reliability. At the same
time, economies of operation will be realized in the near term, and eventually
economies of scale, which would not be available to either company operating
in isolation.
5.04      ELC, in its feasibility study of interconnection, first selected
the best independent programs for power system developments in Nicaragua
and Honduras and then compared the combination of the two selected programs
on the one hand with the proposed program for interconnection of the two
systems on the other hand. The interconnection program was shown to be
less costly for discount rates up to 19%. During the appraisals, in order
to cut down the investments by both companies, ENALUF and ENEE agreed to
modify ELC's proposed program by installing some 35 MW less total generating
capacity before the commissioning of El Cajon. This modification, which
would reduce the reserve capacity in the interconnecting systems, is accept-
able to both companies. With this reduction in investment the proposed
interconnected development is the least-cost alternative for test rates of
discount up to 20% (see Annex 6).
5.05      The interconnection transmission voltage of 230 kV was selected
after analysis indicated that the combined system would be electrically unsthL1e
at a lower operating voltage under conditions resulting from failure of
either the existing "Managua" thermal station or the proposed Puerto
Somoza station.



- 11 -
5.06      Once the feasibility study of El Cajon has been completed by
Motor-Columbus (ENEE's consultant) and adequate agreements for the trans-
fers of electricity to and from ENEE have been made, it is expected that
ENEE will proceed with the construction of El Cajon as currently planned.
After the interconnecting 230 kV lines are constructed, and if for any
reason El Cajon should be postponed for a few years, the interconnection
would still be the least-cost solution for the development of both systems
because:
i) the interconnection would provide a means for the two
utilities to interchange emergency power, and the com-
bined reserve requirements of the two systems would be
less than for independent systems;
ii)   if ENEE were to substitute another hydro project for
El Cajon, it would most likely be of the run-of-river
type, i.e., without seasonal storage facilities, and
its dependable capacity could be increased ecDnomically
by supplementing its output with ENALUF's thermal
energy through the interconnection; and,
iii)   until it is ready to proceed with El Cajon, ENEE could
reduce its financing requirements by continuing to pur-
chase thermal energy from ENALUF to meet its demand, thus
avoiding further capital investments in generating plant.
Puerto Somoza Station
5.07      The only Nicaraguan hydro project identified in sufficient detail
to consider as an alternative to the steam plant at Puerto Samoza is the
40 MW "Nicaragua" plant on the Rio Viejo between Tuma and Santa Barbara.
In order to justify the Puerto Somoza station, two alternative programs
of generating plants to meet the same load forecast were compared: one
with "Nicaragua" hydro before steam development and the other with the
hydro after the steam. The development with steam plant installed before
"Nicaragua" was the least-cost solution for discount rates over 8%.
Kuljian, ENALUF's consultants for its Puerto Somoza steam-electric station,
recommended the installation of two 66 MW units. During the appraisal,
however, the Bank recommended a further study which justified installing
50 MW steam-electric units (the minimum unit size required for meeting
dry year energy requirements for the combined Nicaragua and Honduras system).
5.08      The internal economic return of the Puerto Somoza steam-electric
station and associated transmission facilities is estimated to be about
15% (see Annex 6).



- 12 -
6.  THE BORROWER
6.01      ENALUF was established in 1954 as an autonomous public corpora-
tion. The company is exempt from paying any tax or duty, except income
taxes in the event earnings are not reinvested to improve or extend its
services; since its inception ENALUF has fully reinvested its earnings.
ENALUF has grown into a reasonably well run utility, though there is still
some need for organizational improvements.
Management
6.02      The chief executive of ENALUF, (Executive President), who is
appointed directly by the President of Nicaragua, also serves as Chairman
of the four-man Board. The other three members are selected by the
President, in consultation with his ministers, to represent respectively
the National Economic Council, the National Development Institute and
private interests. Board members, who serve two year terms, are eligible
for reappointment. The chief executive and the Board meet twice weekly
and in this way not only set broad policies, but also control the day to
day operations of the company which should be left to the General Manager.
6.03      The 1968 amendment of the ENALUF Law made the Executive President
the chiaf executive of the company and stipulated that the Board should
hold at least two meetings a week. Since the Law provides no clear
division of responsibility between the Board and the management, this
situation is not ideal.  However, ENALUF's operations have so far been
satisfactory; therefore it is not considered necessary for the Bank to
suggest any immediate change to the Law at this time. The management
consultants to be engaged under this project (see paragraph 6.05) should
review this aspect of ENALUF's management to prepare for the future
separation of the policy making functions of the Board from day to day
operating responsibilities of the management.
Organization and Staffing
6.o4      ENALUF's organization is outlined in general terms in its charter
(Ley Constitutiva), but the company has no bylaws to spell out administrative
procedures. Coordination between the financial and technical departments is
weak and needs some improvement to attain effective financial planning and
budget control.
6.o5      The company is aware of these organizational problems and has
undertook to engage prior to December 31, 1972, management consultants
satisfactory to the Bank and CABEI.  ENALUF has also agreed to consult
from time to time with the Bank and CABEI on actions it proposes to
take on the consultants' recommendations.
6.06      The number of personnel rose excessively during the period 1967-
1971, increasing by about 17% annually, causing the number of consumers per



- 13 -
employee to fall from 75 to 55, which is low in view of ENALUF's mainly
urban supply area. ENALTUF will limit the number of its personnel at the
December 1971 level for a period of about two years, except where addi-
tional personnel is required for operating new facilities.
Operations
6.07      ENALUF's generating plant is well run and maintained properly.
Consumers are served satisfactorily and the quality of service is adequate.
Design and Construction
6.08      Over the years ENALUF has built up a fairly strong technical plan-
ning and construction team. The company should now be capable of taking
over some of the design and supervision tasks until recently executed by
consultants, such as the construction of 138 kV lines. For the proposed
project, however, ENALUF has decided to retain services of consultants for
all engineering and supervision.
Electric Power Tariffs
6.09      The average level of ENALUF's tariffs (see Annex 6) is adequate
to reach the required 9% return as provided under existing loan documents.
However, ENALUF's tariffs still reflect the historic pattern of the in-
dividual systems taken over by the company. For example, the structures
of residential tariffs differ from one area to another as regards the number
of energy block rates, and vary widely in range as well as in unit price.
Industrial tariffs consist of block demand charges and a flat energy charge
instead of more modern single or double (off-peak/peak) demand charges and
block energy charges. ENALUF has indicated that it will start its own
studies with a view towards modernizing its tariff structures and thus has
agreed to complete them within two years after signing the loan, and to
consult with the Bank and CABEI on the results of the studies and proposed
changes.
Fuel Price Adjustment Measure
6.10      ENALUF's fuel contract expired at the end of 1971, and with the
recently signed two-year contract with Esso, prices rose an average of 25%
from about US$2.50 per barrel (about US$0.42 per million Btu) to US$3.10
per barrel (about US$0.52 per million Btu). Any further increase in fuel
prices may well have an adverse effect on ENALUF's ability to finance its
expansion program under present tariffs, because its thermal generation is
rising rapidly both absolutely and relative to hydroelectric generation,
and by 1976 would constitute about 65% of total generation. ENALUF and the
Government have agreed to introduce, not later than one month after effective-
ness of the proposed loan, a satisfactory adjustment measure for
price increases in fuel for ENALUF's steam-electric plant above an average
base price of US$3.10 per barrel. In view of the relatively small amounts
of diesel fuel oil required for ENALUF's operations, this measure would not
apply to increases in price for this type of fuel. The fuel price adjust-
ment measure will stipulate that increases in the base price would be charg-
ed to consumers in ENALUF's main system. An appropriate equivalent measure
will be applied to ENEE.

7. FINANCE
Introduction
7.01      ENALUF's financial performance has been good.  It has earned a
relatively high rate of return averaging 12.4% per year during the past
five years. The return is expected to fall to a 9.6% annual average for
the next five years, mainly due to a 112% expansion of the rate base re-
sulting from completion of the Santa Barbara hydro plant anld facilities
of the proposed project. ENALUF's cash position will be rather tight
during construction of the project, but will be considerably strengthened
following completion, because ENALUF's capital program will slow down
substantially for several years as a result of the interconnection.
Capital Structure and Financial Position
7.02      Balance sheets as of December 31, 1967 through December 31, 1971
are shown in Annex 8. Gross fixed assets and work in progress as of
December 31, 1971 totaled about C$618 million (US$88 million equivalent);
accumulated depreciation was about C$87 million, and net fixed assets
were C$531 million, US$76 million equivalent. The assets are shown at
original cost and are fairly valued. Straight line depreciation is charg-
ed on each group of assets at percentages based on their useful lives; the
resulting overall rate of depreciation has generally averaged around 2.7%,
which is acceptable.
7.03      khereas long-term debt has increased by about 122%, from C$138
million in 1967 to C$307 million in 1971, the debt/equity ratio is only
about 53/47 mainly because ENALUF's healthy earnings were retained in the
business. ENALUF's capitalization as of December 31, 1971 can be sum-
marized as follows:

- 15 -
7.04      ENALUF's equity comprises the contributions made by the
Nicaraguan Government in the form of assets of its predecessor and cash,
along with earned surplus and reserves. It also includes the proceeds
of a US Development Loan Fund (DLF) loan for the Rio Tuma Project. The
DLF loan of US$2.5 million equivalent was contracted in 1960 by ENALUF
as supplementary financing for the Rio Tuma Project. Subsequently, the
Government assumed the contractual obligation under this loan as a capi-
tal contribution and provides for the payment of amortization and inter-
est from budgetary sources.
7.05      The major portion of ENALUF's long-term debt (about 67%) has
been provided from previous Bank loans (121-NI, 154-NI, 259-NI, 470-NI
and 543-NI).  Other foreign exchange and local currency loans and sup-
pliers' credits were obtained for the purchase of material and equip-
ment, purchase of distribution companies, and village electrification.
Two loans are covered by mortgages totaling about C$0.5 million. These
were incurred for the purchase of small municipal power companies and
are secured by the respective properties; this was acceptable to the
Bank. The annual interest in 1970 on long-term debt was 4.9% of the
average total long-term debt outstanding during the year.
Earnings Record
7.06      Income statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 1967
through December 31, 1971 are shown in Annex 9. The annual growth rate
of sales during the period 1967-1971 averaged about 16.6% and earnings
were satisfactory.  The annual rate of return on average net fixed assets
in operation during the 1967-1971 period averaged around 12.4% as compar-
ed with the 9% return required by previous loan documents.
7.07      An unfavorable aspect of ENALUF's operations has been a sub-
stantial increase in operating expenses which rose 76%, from C$34 million
in 1967 to C$60 million in 1970, whereas operating revenue increased by
55% during the same period. The increase in costs is mainly because of
(i) higher fuel and maintenance costs due to increased thermal generation;
and, (ii) higher general and administrative expenses resulting from addi-
tions to ENALUF's staff, as discussed earlier (see paragraph 6.06).
7.08      In the past ENALUF had accumulated excessive accounts receivable.
In order to improve the situation, a test stipulating a 120% ratio between
accounts and notes receivable and sales at the end of each month was agreed
upon during negotiation of Loan 543-NI in 1968. Subsequently, ENALUF has
gradually improved the situation.  Thus, since signing of the Loan 543-NI
in June 1969, ENALUF has only once (in March 1970 when the computer broke
dowzn) exceeded the 120% limit; last year the ratio averaged about 108%.
7.09      The total outstanding receivables on the account of billings for
electrical service as of December 31, 1971 were C$18 million, equivalent to



- 16 -
about two months billings, of which C$8 million were current billings.
Of the C$10 million of receivables in arrears, C$h million were due from
commercial and industrial consumers, C$2.5 million from the Government and
C$2.3 million from domestic consumers; approximately half of these were
in arrears for over three months. To improve the situation further,
ENALUF has agreed to reduce the limit of the test from 120% to 110%.
7.10      ENALUF's accounts conform with generally accepted accounting
principles and public utility practices. They are audited annually by
Arthur Anderson of Mexico in accordance with arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank. The present arrangement for annual audits by independent
outside auditors should be continued.

7.12      The forecast of internal cash generation is based on forecast sales
of ENALUF in Nicaragua, and to Honduras in 1975 and 1976, assuming that any
fuel price increases would be covered by corresponding adjustments to bills.
On this basis, about 36% of the total construction cost would be financed
by net internal cash generation during the 1972-1976 period.



- 18 -
7.13      The forecast long-term debt includes:
i)   US$8.3 million in existing loans (Annex 14);
ii)   the proposed IBRD loan of US$24 million equivalent to cover
(a) 85% of the foreign exchange cost of the project 1/, (b)
the foreign exchange part of the Santa Barbara cost overruns
of US$1.5 million, and (c) US$2.1 million interest during
construction covering approximately 1972-1974 period during
which ENALUF's cash position will be rather tight.  The loan
is assumed to be signed by mid-1972 with an interest rate of
7.25% and a term of 24 years including a grace period of about
four and one half years;
iii)   a CABEI loan of US$6.1 million equivalent to cover (a) 15% of
the foreign exchange cost of the project 1,', for which CABEI
is arranging_funds from Kreditanstalt, (b7 US$2.0 million
equivalent in local currency cost of the project, and (c) us$0.5
million interest during construction for 1972-1974. The proposed
CABEI loan is also assumed to be signed by mid-1972, at an
assumed interest rate of 8% for a term of about 24 years including
a grace period of about four and one half years; and
(iv) other small loans, which have been tentatively arranged, from
Bank of America and CABET in 1973 and 1974, totaling US$3.4
million, to cover parts of ENALUF's distribution expansion.
7.14      CABEI has agreed to the above financing arrangement in a Joint
Financing Agreement with the Bank and ENALUF which also covers coordination
of procurement and disbursement procedures and project supervision. The
effectiveness of the Joint Financing Agreement, and a satisfactory loan
agreement between ENALUF and CABEI will be conditions of effectiveness of
the proposed IBRD Loan.
Future Earnings
7.15      Estimated income statements for 1972 through 1976 are given in
Annex 11. Net Operating Income would increase from C$43,3 million in 1972
to C$64.8 million in 1976, resulting in yearly returns between 9% and 10%
on average net fixed assets in operation. ENALUF has previously agreed to
earn at least a 9% annual return on its average net fixed assets in operation.
To ensure adequate earnings, ENALUF will continue with the 9% return require-
ment.
1/  Excluding C$4,620 (US$660,000) for engineering services which is
being financed by CABEI separately.



- 19 -
7.16      Net income is expected to increase from C$24.7 million in 1972
to C$41.8 million in 1975, and then fall to C$375 million in 1976 due to
an increased proportion of generation by the thermal plant and higher
interest expense. Total net income for the five year period is estimated
at C$175 million (US$25 million). Since the financing plan is based on the
reinvestment of all internally generated funds, ENALUF has agreed to retain
all such funds for investment in new facilities until the project is completed.
Future Financial Position
7.17      Forecast Balance Sheets and financial ratios for the next five
years are shown in Annexes 10 and 13, respectively. The debt/equity ratio
will increase fram 54/46 in 1972 to 56/44 in 1974 and then fall to 51/49
by 1976, which is satisfactory.
7.18      During 1971-1976, internal cash generation will cover total debt
service (including capitalized interest) on existing and assumed future
debts between 1.4 and 2.0 times on an annual basis.  It was agreed during
negotiations that in the future, ENALUF will seek the Bank's agreement before
incurring long term debt, unless its net revenues before interest charges
and depreciation is at least 1.5 times maximum debt service in any future
year.
7.19      As indicated in paragraph 7.13(d), the financing plan assumes
two small loans from the Bank of America and CABEI in 1973 and 1974, total-
ing US$3.4 million, to cover parts of ENALUF's distribution expansion.  In
both cases ENALUF's debt service coverage would be below 1.5 times and thus
the loans would require Bank approval.
7.20      ENALUF's cash position will be tight from 1972 through 1974 be-
cause of the heavy construction program. However, adequate cash, equivalent
to at least two weeks requirements, will be in hand at all times for day to
day operations. In addition, ENALUF maintains several lines of credits with
commercial banks totaling US$2 million, for its use when necessary.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND REOOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a)       ENALUF will:
i)   con-tinue to employ engineering consultants satisfactory to  th  Bank
CABEI (paragraph 4.05);
ii)   employ management consultants not later than December 31, 1972,
and consult with the Bank and CABEI on actions it proposes to
take on the consultant's recommendations (paragraph 6.05);
iii)   complete tariff studies within two years after loan signing
and consult with the Bank and CABEI on the result of the studies
and proposed changes (paragraph 6.09);
iv)   adopt a satisfactory fuel price adjustment measure for its
tariff schedules (paragraph 6.10);
v)   lower the receivables index to 110% (paragraph 7.09);
vi)   continue to have its accounts audited annually by independent
outside auditors acceptable to the Bank and CABEI (paragraph 7.10),
vii)   continue to earn at least a 9% annual return on average net fixed
assets in operation (paragraph 7.15);
viii)   retain all its earnings for reinvestment in new facilities until
the project is completed (paragraph 7.16); and
ix)   adopt a debt service coverage test of 1.5 times (paragraph 7.18).
(b)       The Nicaraguan Government will:
i)   enable ENALUF to charge to its consumers additional operating
expenses resulting from future price increases of fuel oil
(paragraph 6.10); and
ii)   enable ENALTF to maintain sufficient tariffs to earn the 9%
return.
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the Loan would be:
i)   effectsiveness of the Joint Financing Agreement (paragraph 7.14);
and
ii)   a satisfactory loan agreement between ENALUF and CABEI on
financing of the CABEI portion of the project (paragraph 7.14).



- 21 -
8.03      ENALUF will not be eligible to withdraw funds for construction of
those parts of the project directly related to the interconnection until:
i)   the legislative bodies of Nicaragua and Honduras have ratified
the interconnection treaty (paragraph 3.09); and
ii)   the power supply contract between ENALUF and ENEE has become
effective (paragraph 3.10).
8.04      With the above agreements the project forms a satisfactory basis
for a Bank Loan of US$24 million equivalent for 24 years including a
grace period of about four and one half years.

APPRAISAL OF THE EIGHTH POWER PROJECT-NICARAGUA
(NICARAGUA-HONDURAS INTERCONNECTION)
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LUZ Y FUERZA
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
1.   Puerto Somoza Steam-Electric Plant
The proposed power plant consists of two 50 MW non-reheat stand-
ard boiler and turbo-generator units operating completely independently at
a pressure of 850 lb/sq in and a temperature of 9000F, using Bunker C oil
for fuel. The station is to be located on a rocky promontory on the
Pacific coast near a port (Puerto Somoza) which has practically unlimited
extension possibilities. Sea water from the Pacific Ocean will be used
for cooling and an intake structure will be erected adjacent to the shore.
The station will be of the semi-outdoor type, with a structural steel build-
ing, adequately protected against the effects of the sea coast environment.
Two 100,000 barrel fuel oil storage tanks will be provided which either will
be filled through the nearby Esso unloading and storage facilities or
through a 3.5 to 4 kIn submarine line for unloading at sea, depending on the
outcome of future fuel oil delivery negotiations. An access road will be
constructed and housing for personnel will be provided on the site. Sub-
station facilities will deliver 230 kV to be transmitted to Managua and Leon.
2.   230 kV Transmission System
Single circuit 230 kV lines will be provided between Puerto Somoza
and Managua (60 km), Puerto Somoza and Leon (35 km) and between Leon and the
border with Honduras (70 km), mounted on galvanized structural steel lattice
towers. Step-down and switching and protection facilities will be provided
at Leon at the present 138 kV substation which will be extended for this pur-
pose. A new 230/138 kV substation would be constructed to the south of
Managua at Tiscapa. A simple load dispatch center will be accommodated in
this substation. All necessary telemetering, telecontrol and communication
facilities would be provided at Puerto Somoza and the substations.
3.   138 kV Transmission System Extension
A 138 kV single circuit line with a total length of about 75 km,
mounted on lattice type towers, will be constructed closing a ring around
Managua. This ring will be supplied from the existing Masaya substation
in the east, the thermal station at Managua, the new 230/138 kV substation
at Tiscapa to be constructed under the project to the south of Managua and
a new 138 kV substation, Los Brasiles. A switching bay will be added to the
138 kV substation at Sebaco. A 90 km long, lattice-tower-mounted, single-
circuit line will be constructed similar to ENALF's present 138 kV lines,
to connect Yalaguina to Sebaco. A 5000 kVA step-down substation will be
provided in Yalaguina to connect an electric cooperative network that is be-
ing financed with the assistance of USAID.

POWER EXPANSION STUDIES
Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.        ENALUF's ra-te of growth is expected to remain high during the next
five years, although not as spectacular as in the past. Gross genera-
tion increased from about 50 GWi in 1958, the first year of ENALUF's
operation, to 269 GWh in 1966,or 23% annually. Since 1966, gross genera-
tion increased to 523 GWn in 1971, or about 14% annually. Under conditions
of sustained rapid growth the preparation of load forecasts is always
difficult. It is not surprising therefore that forecasts used for the last
two Bank loans to ENALUF show underestimates from the third year onwards.
During this appraisal, two forecasts of sales (GWh) and maximum demand (MW)
were available, one prepared by the consultants (ELC) and the other by ENALUF.
They show only small differences. The forecasts contained in this report
are based on 1965-1970 trends (i.e. years judged to be of t"normal" growth)
for the various categories and the projections of ELC and ENALUF. Additional
consideration was given to future developments in Managua, particularly in
the industrial sector, and the connection of cooperative in the next three
years.
2.        Sales in the central system, which increased (see Annex 5)only
by about 8% during 1971, are expected to grow at an average rate of about
15% for the next three years, mainly due to connection of new areas per-
taining to the cooperatives, and to existing and new industry. Sales (ex-
cluding supply to Honduras) would increase by some 10% annually, during
the period 1974-1977. Additionally, ENEE is expected to purchase some 110
GWh in 1985, 180 GTih in 1976, and 260 GWh in 1977; the overall growth of sales
would be about 20% annually for the period 1974-1976. The characteristics
and changes in ENALUF's market (including outlying systems but excluding
supplies to Honduras) are illustrated by the following:

Industrial sales have grown rapidly and are expected to continue. Bulk
sales declined between 1965 and 1970, reflecting the fact that ENALUF
absorbed various private and municipal systems. Connection of
the cooperatives will now cause bulk sales to start increasing.
3.        Total losses, which are a relatively low 15%, are expected to
remain at about this level through the forecast period.  Because thiey in-
clude station services which, due to increased thermal generation, are
expected to increase, network losses would actually be reduced.
4.        Maximum demand was calculated on the basis of the forecast sales
and losses, taking into account a load factor of 62% in 1971 and 1972
decreasing to 60% in 1973-1974 to reflect a relatively rapid increase in
bulk sales (which would mainly be residential), and further decreasing to
58% for the period 1975-1977 due to ENEE's lower load factor.
Feasibility Study
5.        ENALUF and ENEE jointly engaged Electroconsult (ELC) of Italy
to make a feasibility study of the proposed interconnection of the two
systems. The companies agreed to use the following criteria for re-
serves: for independent development , each system should have a reserve
capacity equal to that of the largest unit; after the systems are inter-
connected, each system should have sufficient firm capability, i.e.,
assuming the largest unit out of service, to meet at least 85% of the
peak demand in the event of interruption of the interconnection.
6.        The consultants first studied alternative generation programs
for each system for the period 1972-1985 and selected the most economic
one for each system. Then the proposed interconnection project was com-
pared with the combination of the two selected programs.
7.        For the independent development in Nicaragua, two alternative
programs were compared: one with a mixed hydro-steam development, the
other with an all-steam development. The latter, which included two 60
MW units to be installed in 1975 and 1977, was determined to be the more
economic solution up to 17% rate of discount.
8.        For the independent development in Honduras, the most economic
program, among four alternatives, comprised a 40 MW steam power station
at La Ceiba to be installed in 1975 and a 126 NW El Cajon Chico project
to be constructed in 1979 (with a dam 125 m high instead of 220 m for El
Cajon).
9.        Although El Cajon would be the main source of power for the
interconnected system over a number of years, both ENALUF and ENEE would
need other generating capacity additions to meet the reserve criteria
mentioned in paragraph 1. ELC proposed the following generation program
for the next decade for the interconnected system:



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 4 pages
ENALUF:   60 KW steam unit at Lake Managua in 1975
60 MW steam unit at Lake Managua in 1977
ENEE:     40 MW steam unit at La Ceiba in 1974
6 x 63 MW hydro units at El Cajon in 1978
10.        ELC showed that the interconnection program would be more
economic than the combination of the best independent developments for
discount rates up to 19%.
11.        The consultants studied six alternative schemes of transmission
systems covering alternative routes, different transmission voltages
(138, 230 and 345 kV) and different circuit arrangements (single-circuit
and double-circuit). They concluded that a single-circuit 230 kV line
linking Leon in Nicaragua to Tegucigalpa in Honduras, to be operated at
138 kV initially until El Cajon is commissioned, would be the least cost
solution.
Final Modifications
12.        During the two appraisals, it was agreed that, in order to
reduce investments by both companies. ELC's proposed program for inter-
connection would be modified as follows:
ENALUF:  50 MW steam unit at Puerto Somoza in 1975
50 MW steam unit at Puerto Somoza in 1976
ENEE:    24 MW diesel units at La Ceiba in 1974
4 x 75 MW hydro units at El Cajon in 1978
13.        It was also decided that, due to stability considerations, the
interconnection line would be operated at 230 kV from the start.
i4.        The above modifications would reduce the reserve capacity of each
system thereby lowering the percentage of firm capability from the original-
ly agreed 85% to 79% for ENEE in 1977 and for ENALUJF in 1982 which is ac-
ceptable to both companies. The equalizing discount rate is now about 20%.
15.        After the interconnecting 230 kV lines are constructed, and if for
any reason El Cajon should be postponed for a few years, the interconnection
would still be the least-cost solution for the development of both systems as
discussed in paragraph 5.06.
Internal Economic Return
16.        The internal economic return (IER) of a project is defined as the
discount rate at which the internal cost and benefits attributable to the
project are equal. Attributable costs are calculated net of duties, taxes,
depreciation and debt service. Attributable revenues (including sales taxes)
have been taken as a minimum value of benefits.



ANNEX 6
Page 4 of 4 pages
17.        The IER on the Nicaraguan portion of the interconnecting scheme
comprising the Puerto Somoza station and the associated transmission system
was calculated on the following basis:
i)   Price levels from 1976 onward were kept at the 1975 level for the
remaining years of the 1972-2001 discounting period.
ii)   Capital expenditures were taken as the estimated 1972-1976 expern-
ditures for the interconnection scheme.
iii)   Fuel cost were used as forecast for Puerto Somoza station for
the period 1975-1981 (the year in which El Cajon's hydro supply
to Nicaragua would be reduced to such a level that the Puerto
Somoza station would again be operating at full capacity), i.e.,
based on present day prices, assuming that any variation in
price would be passed on directly to consumers and therefore would
effect revenues by an equivalent amount in the calculations. From
1981 onward, for the remaining period of discounting, fuel costs
were assumed to decrease linearly to zero by 2001.
iv)   Operational costs were used as forecast for the Puerto Somoza
station and associated lines for the period 1975-1981 and assumed
to reduce linearly from 1981 onward to about two thirds of the
1981 cost at the end of the discounting period.
v)   Incremental annual revenue from sales (including supplies to
Honduras) was calculated for the period 1975-1981 and assumed
to decrease linearly to zero for the remaining period of dis-
counting, corresponding to the utilization of the facilities
being considered. About 70% of this revenue was attributed to
the Puerto Somoza scheme because, between discount rates of 10-
15%, the ratio of the present value of the annual Puerto Somoza
expenditures and ENALUF's overall 1972-1976 expansion program,
is about 70/30.
18.        On the basis of the above assumptions the internal economic rate
of return of the Puerto Somoza station and associated transmission facilities
is about 15%.

APPRAISAL OF THE EIGHTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
(NICARAGUA-HONDURAS INTERCONNECTION)
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LUZ Y FUERZA
ELECTRIC POWER TARIFFS
General
1.        In 1969 the Instituto Nacional de Energia Electrica was created
to regulate the power sector, replacing the Comision Nacional de Energia
which had never exercised its regulatory role. The Instituto should in
due course make a study of all Nicaraguan tariffs in order to unify and
modernize them.
2.        ENALUF's tariffs show a pattern similar to that throughout most
of the smaller Latin American countries. Basically the structure is simple
(see below) and the average level of tariffs is adequate to reach the re-
quired rate of return of 9% as agreed with the Bank, but some modification
in structure appears appropriate to eliminate inconsistencies and to modern-
ize industrial tariffs to allow off-peak and peak-demand charges, and block
energy charges. ENALUF has indicated that it will start its own studies for
modernizing the tariff structure. The Bank should follow up the progress
during supervision visits.
Tariff Structure
3.        ENALUF's residential and commercial tariffs still reflect the
historic pattern of the individual systems taken over by the company. Energy
block rates differ in number and vary widely in range as well as in unit price.
4.        Industrial tariffs have been unified and three tariffs are applied,
respectively for an installed capacity of 1-5 kW, for 5-25 kW, and for demand
exceeding 25 kW. In the first two cases energy block rates are expressed in
hours of utilization per installed kW in order to simplify metering (a similar
"commercial" tariff caters for the larger commercial institutions such as
hotels, banks, department stores, etc.). All industrial tariffs apply block
demand charges and a flat energy charge of 12 ctv/kWh instead of a more modern
single or double (off-peak/peak) demand charge and block energy charges. No
voltage-related tariffs are available. In general the power factor is not
metered but ENALUF has the option to investigate if certain limits are exceeded,
in which case a surcharge formula applies. ENALUF's largest consumer is the
caustic soda factory of Electroquimica Pensalt S. A., which has a contracted
minimum of 3,000 kW. A special tariff applies to this factory with a flat
energy charge of 7 ctv/kWh for a minimum load factor of 90%. For load factors
below 90%, demand as well as energy charges apply. In 1970 supply to this
factory amounted to about 43 GWh and maximum demand was 7,100 kW.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3 pages
5.        Government (including pumping for potable water systems) and
streetlighting supplies are charged at flat energy rates without a demand
charge. In view of difficulties in collecting for streetlighting, sur-
charges on all consumers' bills are now generally applied, and ENALUF is
negotiating with several municipalities to apply this method throughout its
system.
6.        Energy block rates (14 ctv/kWh for the first monthly 1,000 kWh
down to 9 ctv/kWh for supplies over 100,000 kW monthly) apply for smaller
private irrigation systems. A flat rate of 8 ctv/kWh is applied for the
larger government irrigation developments near Leon and Rivas.
7.        ENALUF sells in bulk to several municipally and privately owned
electricity companies at 21 ctv/kkh for 210 hours of maximum demand; excess
kkh are charged 13 ctv/kW.  It is intended to apply a flat energy charge
of 12.5 ctv/kWa for bulk supplies to distribution cooperatives and for which
irrigation supplies which are resold by the cooperatives and for which
ENALUF will charge 8.5 ctv/kWh.
8.        ENALUF recently signed a new contract for fuel showing an average
price of US$3.10 per barrel, compared with US$2.60 per barrel under the old
contract. In view of the possibility that international fuel prices will
continue consistently to rise, ENALUF will include a fuel oil price adjust-
ment clause in its general conditions for application of tariffs, stipulating
that increases over the average present fuel price for its steam-electric plar
(US$3.10 per barrel), would be charged directly to its consumers.
Incremental Cost and Revenue
9.        In order to test the tariffs as to their adequacy to generate
sufficient additional cash at the margin for ENALUF (i.e., on the increase
in kWi sold from one year to the next), historic and forecast incremental
annual cost and revenue and increases in sales were compared with the
previous year figures. For this purpose incremental cost per incremental kWki
sold is defined as the increment, from one year to the next, in operating cost,
excluding depreciation, but including actual annual total debt service,
divided by the increase in kWh of sales during the same period.
10.       Average incremental cost and revenue for various periods are the
following:

ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 3 pages
The increase in forecast incremental cost is mainly due to the considerable
increase in debt service in the period 1971-1973; for the period 1973-1976
the increase would be small. The decrease in forecast incremental revenue
for 1974-1976 is mainly due to the low priced supply to Honduras; the
average incremental revenue for 1971-1974 (prior to interconnection) would
be 16.4 ctv/kWchs which reflects incremental revenues from ENALUF's
Nicaraguan consumers.
11.       Using the incremental costs listed above the following conclusions
are reached:
i)   For the period 1966-1971 the total incremental operating cost per
incremental kWh sold, of about 14.5 ctv/kWh, was considerably in
excess of the price of 7 ctv/kWh obtained from ENALTF's largest
consumer (the caustic soda factory, which started operation in
1968) and the lowest block rates of 8-9 ctv/kWh for irrigation.
Since both types of consumers probably give high secondary benefits
to the economy, the implied cross subsidization, although sub-
stantial, may be justified.
ii)   For the same period, because the lowest rate in any of the other
tariffs is 12 ctv/kSh (industries with a maximum demand exceeding
25 kW), incremental cost was well in excess of incremental re-
venue per kWh of sales,
iii)   For the period 1971-1974 (with the high incremental debt service)
incremental cost would considerably exceed revenue from the low-
est block rates, and particularly supply to the caustic soda
factory and irrigation would continue to be considerably cross
subsidized. However, from 1974 onward, it appears that incre-
mental cost would drop below the revenue of the lowest rates
(12 ctv/kWh) for all customers except the caustic soda factory
and irrigation.
Interconnection Tariff
12.       Mr. John F. Pett, a private US consultant, who was engaged by
ENALUR and ENEE to help them draft the highly technical provisions for the
interconnection contract, has revised ELC's estimates. For purpose of this
report Mr. Pett's suggested price of US$22/kW (C$154/kW) and 7 mills US$/kWh
(4.9 ctv/kWh)resulting in an average price of about 11.3 mills US$/kWh, has
been used to forecast revenue from supplies to Honduras in 1975 and 1976.
Prior to initiating power supply to Honduras the price to be applied will be
finally calculated on the basis of rules provided for this purpose in the
contract.
