Operation Type           Development Policy Loan (stand-alone)
Main Policy Areas        Fiscal, Budget, Banking and Finance
Key Outcome Indicators   Main expected outcomes of the program supported by the proposed operation
                         are: (i) the continuation of economic growth and improvements in social
                         indicators; (ii) more effective, strategic, and flexible public resource
                         management, including management of the country's oil wealth; (iii) successful
                         debt restructuring of large problem banks; and (iv) more effective bank
                         regulation and resolution framework.
Program Development      The operation supports the Government's program of policy measures to foster
Objective(s) and         economic growth and sustain living standards of the population in the aftermath
Contribution to CAS      of the economic crisis. The program's objective is to support the Government's
                         efforts in: (i) strengthening public resource management (including oil revenues)
                         through increased efficiency and re-orientation of spending, and (ii) reducing
                         vulnerabilities in the financial sector through restructuring large problem banks,
                         and strengthening the bank supervisory, regulatory and resolution frameworks.
                         The proposed DPL is the major portion of the revised lending program in
                         Kazakhstan, consistent with the CPS objectives presented to the Board in 2004.
                         The proposed DPL is aligned with the first pillar of the CPS, "reducing losses in
                         competitiveness through prudent management of the oil revenues and increased
                         public sector efficiency," and indirectly supports the other three pillars by
                         helping the Government to strengthen public resource management and address
                         vulnerabilities in financial sector.
Risks and Risk           The major overall risk to the results of this operation is the possibility of
Mitigation               insufficient follow-through of reforms over the medium-term or back-tracking in
                         some areas. The major economic risks primarily concern high vulnerability to
                         volatility in commodity prices and to remaining vulnerabilities in the financial
                         sector, including unknown or new non-performing loans and/or a failure to
                         restructure BTA. Political risks arise from possible social instability and
                         resulting opposition to elements of the Government's program. The policies
                         supported by the proposed DPL will contribute significantly to mitigating these
                         economic and political risks through measures aimed at establishing strong
                         fiscal discipline, fostering growth, alleviating the impact of the economic crisis
                         on the vulnerable population and the emerging middle class, the orderly
                         restructuring of troubled banks, and strengthening regulation and supervision of
                         the financial sector. Follow-through of reforms over the medium-term will be
                         sustained by continued Bank engagement and other Bank instruments.

                         IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
                  PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY LENDING
                                 LOAN TO KAZAKHSTAN

                                       I. INTRODUCTION
1.        This document describes a program of policy measures by the Government of
Kazakhstan to foster economic growth and protect living standards to be supported by a
proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the amount of USD 1 billion. In response to
external shocks beginning in August 2007, the Government embarked on a program combining a
fiscal stimulus and policy reforms in 2008, which includes measures supported by this operation
in the following two areas: (i) strengthening public resource management, in particular the rules
for the National (oil) Fund (NF) and budgetary management at national and local levels, and
(ii) strengthening the financial sector and addressing its vulnerabilities.

2.      The country has a track record of market reform, prudent management of its oil
resources, and strong growth and poverty reduction for nearly a decade. This was
accompanied by a sizeable accumulation of foreign exchange and NF reserves, as the
Government maintained total spending at a stable share of GDP even as oil prices rose. Large
inflows of foreign direct investment drove growth in the oil and mining sectors.

3.       Kazakhstan?s crisis began earlier than the world economic turmoil, and the
Government responded by shoring up aggregate demand, stabilizing the banking system
and protecting the living standards of the population. During the commodities price boom,
private commercial banks expanded external borrowing and commercial credit to the housing and
real estate sectors at a very rapid pace. A sudden stop in foreign capital inflows to the banking
sector in August 2007 precipitated a banking crisis and disrupted credit flows to the economy
with adverse effects on growth and employment. The onset of the global economic crisis
worsened the situation as a result of sharp declines in commodity prices and export revenues.
The Government responded by adopting a series of measures, including a large anti-crisis fiscal
package. Total public spending rose in 2008 and 2009, due to support for the economy,
commercial banks, transfers to the regions for public works, and other social spending. These
actions were all aimed at stabilizing the financial sector, protecting growth and alleviating distress
among the most vulnerable as well as the emerging middle class. This fiscal stimulus was
accompanied by reforms to strengthen public resource management and the financial sector, both
viewed as priority areas in the context of the crisis.

4.      The reforms in public resource management seek to restore discipline in the use of
NF resources and to increase efficiency of public spending. The non-oil budgetary deficit,
which jumped in 2008 and peaked in 2009, was financed almost fully by exceptional uses of NF
resources, both on and off-budget. There was a weakening of discipline in the use of NF
resources relative to the pre-crisis period and domestic pressures to continue easy access remain
strong. To restore discipline quickly, the Government issued a decree to limit the size of annual
NF transfers to the budget and to forbid its use for off-budget activities. Further improvements in
the governance arrangements and management of the NF will be based on the results of the
technical work that is being now conducted by the Government jointly with the Bank. With
regards to public spending management, a new budget code is being implemented that includes
the adoption of medium-term budget preparation and approval at both the national and the local
levels, more regular internal audits in all budgetary organizations, and greater flexibility for
budgetary managers to reallocate resources within their programs during budget execution.
These reforms are consistent with the Bank's analysis and advice.

5.      The banking crisis revealed important gaps in regulatory institutions and policies
that are being addressed. The reforms that have been initiated include both revised policy
frameworks and actions for the orderly resolution of troubled banks, including the restructuring of
foreign debts. The Government has taken over two of the largest banks-BTA and Alliance-
and is negotiating agreements with their foreign creditors to restructure debt, reducing the banks'
outstanding external loans by as much as 60 and 75 percent, respectively. The plan is to divest
the majority state ownership and management of these two banks as soon as the economy and
markets recover enough to make that feasible. The capacity of the supervision agencies has been
increased, though still more needs to be done. Several improvements in the regulatory and
supervisory frameworks have also been implemented. These initial measures have already
improved confidence, strengthened incentives in banks for the prudent management of risks, and
thereby constitute important steps towards preserving financial stability and reviving domestic
lending in an orderly manner.

6.      The World Bank has supported the Government in developing and implementing its
reforms for many years. This support has been provided mainly in the form of joint analytic
and technical work (Le. AAA consisting of both TA and ESW) and policy dialogue, as well as
through investment loans. The analytic and technical work has been co-financed by the
Government under its Joint Economic Research Program (JERP) that began in 2002. The work
has consisted of reports, workshops, high-level brainstorming sessions co-chaired by the Prime
Minister and Regional Vice President, and a regular dialogue on policies. Over the last few
years, the analytical work and policy dialogue has focused on the areas of public resource
management, education, health, agriculture and the financial sector, and-more recently-on
poverty, social protection and social sector expenditures. More analytical work and investment
loans are planned in the coming years to continue supporting reforms.

7.       To foster growth and protect living standards, the Government plans to continue a
moderate fiscal stimulus, and to phase it out as growth recovers. The recently approved
three-year rolling budget envisages an annual non-oil deficit during 20 10- 12 that is lower than the
peak in 2009, but higher than the pre-crisis period. The recently imposed limit on annual NF
transfers will result in a projected gap in financing annual non-oil deficits amounting to
4.6 percent, 3.6 percent and 3.8 percent of GDP in 2010, 201 1 and 2012 respectively. Current
plans are to finance these deficits primarily by domestic borrowing, as well as by some borrowing
from abroad. Kazakhstan has adequate fiscal space to continue the stimulus, as public and
publicly guaranteed domestic and external debt amounted to only 10 percent of GDP in 2009.
Also, the oil sector is projected to grow again after the Kashagan off-shore project comes on line
in 2014, and oil output should double after 2020. The restoration of private sector's confidence
and access to credit is expected to increase non-oil growth and non-oil revenues, permitting an
exit from the stimulus. But the pace and timing remain uncertain.

8.     Beyond the response to the crisis, the Government's strategy for diversification of
the economy is anchored in the recognition of the paramount role of the private sector.
Though diversification towards non-extractive tradables has been part and parcel of Kazakhstan's
development strategy, actual success has so far been limited. Agriculture has made some
headway with agricultural exports now at 4 percent of GDP and with potential to grow further.
Additional support to agriculture and to rural infrastructure is underway to tap that potential. The
government aims to facilitate private sector growth in the non-oil sectors by improving the
investment climate for small and medium sized enterprises, investing in infrastructure in key


                                                -2-
areas such as rural infrastructure, transportation, trade facilitation, and selected interventions to
increase competitiveness in industry and agriculture through better standards and certification
procedures.

9.      The composition of stimulus spending is changing. In 2008 and 2009, a good deal of
additional spending went to support commercial banks and struggling enterprises, as was
appropriate at the time, with the rest going to the social sectors and public works. As confidence
and stability improved in the banking sector, increasingly more is being spent on the latter.
Monitoring and evaluation of the public works, an assessment of social sector spending priorities
and mechanisms, and improvements to targeted social assistance programs can contribute to fine-
tuning these expenditures for better impact. There are also plans to continue using a part of the
stimulus spending to promote growth in the non-oil private sector, including agriculture.

10.      The proposed DPL will finance a part of the non-oil deficit in 2010 as markets
recover, and signal the Government's intention to harden the budget constraint and end
easy access to the NF. In 2008 and 2009, large transfers from the NF were made on an
exceptional basis to finance both budget and off-budget expenditures. The Government aims to
restore discipline in the use of oil revenues quickly, and to sustain it in a structured and
transparent manner. A higher profile engagement with the Bank through the DPL, accelerated
technical work and a deeper dialogue on the management of the NF is expected to enhance the
effectiveness of the Government's efforts to maintain fiscal discipline and strengthen the
governance of the NF over the medium term. Success in this respect will increase the confidence
of both domestic and foreign investors in Kazakhstan by signaling the Government's willingness
to hold the line in the face of domestic pressures, thereby accumulating reserves in the NF amidst
an uncertain domestic and external environment.

11.     The DPL also supports prior actions beyond the NF, especially in the financial
sector and in budgetary management, that are essential for stability, recovery and stronger
growth. These prior actions are part and parcel of the Government's medium term reform
program, and have been the subject of joint analytical work, brainstormings and policy dialogue
with the Bank. They are also prerequisites for the next steps in the ongoing reform process.
Restoring and sustaining confidence and stability in the financial sector is essential for the
recovery of credit flows to private firms, and increasing efficiency of public spending is
important for enhancing the impact of the continuing fiscal stimulus. Together, they lay the basis
for other policies to advance diversification and non-oil growth in Kazakhstan.

12.     The DPL was not envisaged in the original CPS, but its objectives are fully aligned
with it. The reforms supported by the operation are fully aligned with the first pillar of the CPS
and partially aligned with the other two. Together they cover steps to manage oil revenues
prudently, increasing public sector efficiency and ensuring credit to businesses by addressing
financial sector vulnerabilities. Beyond the DPL, the Bank will continue to support the
Government's program of reforms with other instruments, as it has done so far, through analytical
work and policy dialogue, and where relevant with investment loans.

GDP growth averaged 10 percent
and average real incomes more than doubled along with GDP, transforming Kazakhstan into an
upper-middle income economy in a relatively short time.
14.     Kazakhstan has made progress in poverty reduction but the urban-rural gap
persists. The estimated share of the population living below the official poverty line declined
from 44.5percent in 2002 to 12 percent by the end of 2008 (see Table 1). The gap between urban
and rural living standards is still significant in Kazakhstan, which reflects a high concentration of
growth and value added production in larger cities and resource-rich Western regions. While the
poverty headcount declined to under 10 percent in urban areas, it has remained over 20 percent in
rural locations.' Along with the rapid growth, the unemployment rate (ILO definition) in the
country declined from an estimated 13 percent in 2000 to under 7 percent in recent years.




' Official estimates of headcount poverty slightly differ from the poverty estimates derived by the World
Bank due to a different methodology of constructing consumption aggregates. This table cites official
numbers, while the poverty profile presented in Table 3 is based on the World Bank calculations. See 2009
"KZ Poverty Assessment Notes" for more discussion of the differences between the official and World
Bank-derived poverty estimates and for more on poverty profile, the effect of crisis on poverty, and the
efficiency of social safety net. Since the profile only covers a period between 2006 and 2008, official
poverty numbers are cited to indicate the poverty trends for a longer time period (2002-2009).

 Fund, which reached US$27 billion (21 percent of GDP) by end-2008 (see Figure 2), and to
 maintain relatively low inflation for most of this period, Nevertheless, large capital inflows to the
 banks, coupled with fiscal and private foreign investment spending, contributed to an overheating
 of the economy in the years immediately preceding the crisis.

 16.      The National Fund helped prevent excessive real appreciation of the exchange rate.
 While the tenge appreciated in real terms by an estimated 20 percent in 2000-2008, this was less
 than in many other resource-exporting countries during this period. This partly reflects the
 sterilization of a large part of the oil-related inflows through the National Fund. The fact that a
 significant share of oil profits are expatriated from Kazakhstan provides another counterbalancing
 force to the impact of oil prices on the external balance. But the pace of real appreciation did
 pick up considerably in 2006-2008 because of substantial unsterilized capital inflows. The tenge
 appreciated in real terms by only 2 percent during 2000-2005, but by 18 percent from 2006-2008.

  17.      Despite responsible fiscal and monetary policies, economic overheating and the
  seeds of financial instability came to Kazakhstan with massive capital inflows in the form of
  foreign loans. These inflows were related to soaring real estate prices in Kazakhstan's larger
  cities and a related boom in housing construction. International creditors supplied larger (private)
  commercial banks with abundant unsecured credit. Creditors largely expected that the
  Government would use National Fund resources to prevent failures of these large systemically
  important banks. This expectation, combined with soaring commodity and real estate prices and
  limited banking regulation and supervision capacity, set the stage for a severe financial bubble.

growth (see Figure 4),

in-2006 to limit the ability of banks to borrow abroad, the financial sector and housing lobbies
resisted significant new measures and prevailed.

External shocks of late 2000s

20.      In 2007 and 2008, Kazakhstan was hit by two external shocks in quick succession.
The first shock came in August 2007 from a sudden stop in foreign inflows (loans) to the banking
sector, triggering a financial crisis. The second came with the onset of the world financial crisis
in the fall of 2008. Economic growth slumped from near double digits to only 3 . 3 and 1.2 percent
in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Unemployment rose and then stabilized. The fiscal surplus
turned into a deficit in 2009 for the first time since 2001, as commodity prices and revenues fell.
The banking sector faced liquidity shortages and debt-servicing problems. In response, the
Government mounted an anti-crisis stimulus, using its fiscal savings to support the financial
sector and the real economy, thereby cushioning the impact of the crisis.



                                                     -6-
2 1.     The period August 2007 - December 2009 is associated with US$21 billion dollars of
anti-crisis support. The majority of this came from the Republican budget or the large state
corporate conglomerate Samruk-Kazyna (see Box 1). Table 2 summarizes the primary sequence
of events and programs of 2007-2009, as well as estimated costs to the Government and foreign
creditors. Approximately half of this money (US$l 1 billion) was devoted to direct assistance to
struggling commercial banks (primarily BTA), while the other half (over US$l 0 billion) financed
anti-crisis stimulus measures in various sectors of the economy. In addition to the public works
program listed in Table 2, the Government increased other social spending significantly during
this period, mainly through a structural reallocation of budgetary spending. Separately, an
amount of US$lO billion is now expected as costs to foreign creditors in write downs of foreign
debts for BTA and Alliance in the process of their restructuring.

Thefirst external shock of August 2007 and the policy response

22.      A sudden stop in capital inflows in August 2007 sparked a banking crisis which
persists, and threatened Kazakhstan with general financial instability. The investor panic of
August 2007 came at a time when the foreign indebtedness of the Kazakhstani banking sector
surpassed even the gross monetary and fiscal reserves of the country. Another concern was a
growing current account deficit, due primarily to rapid import growth related to the credit
expansion, which reached US$2.9 billion for the first half of 2007. A sudden stop in capital
(credit) inflows triggered a liquidity crisis in the banking sector, as well as a speculative run on
deposits and the national currency.

23.      Initial Government and National Bank measures to stabilize the situation in late
2007 were successful. The package included a commitment to defend the exchange rate of
120 tenge to the US dollar, together with the provision of sufficient liquidity to prevent a collapse
of the banking system. This basic recipe proved effective for stabilizing expectations in late 2007
and most of 2008. Its effectiveness received a major boost from record oil and commodity prices,
which generated a sizeable current account surplus to compensate for the deterioration in the
capital account. In 2007, the Government also revised the budget to channel additional funding
(US$l.5 billion) to the ailing construction sector, particularly for the completion of frozen
construction projects with positive present value that were financed partly by pre-payments of
future residents, and for the refinancing of SME loans (US$l.3 billion).

24.      The financial shock of 2007 froze the expansion of commercial credit and slowed
growth and poverty reduction, but economic prospects improved by mid-2008. Without the
former rapid growth in finance and construction, GDP growth in 2008 fell to 3.3 percent. The
business and financial capital of the country, Almaty, actually experienced a recession in 2008
(-2.5 percent growth). The financial shock also led to a slowdown in the decline of poverty in
Kazakhstan. While the poverty headcount declined steadily after 2000, it actually increased
slightly between 2007 and 2008. This increase was driven by an increase in urban poverty.

The impact of the worldfinancial crisis and the policy response

25.     The onset of the world economic crisis in the second half of 2008, and associated
sharp declines in commodity prices, had a severe impact on Kazakhstan. Monthly export
revenues fell from US$3-5 billion in the first 11 months of 2008 to less than US$1.5 billion in
December 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009. Correspondingly, the current account moved
from a surplus of US$3.7 billion in the first half of 2008 to a deficit of US$3.5 billion in the first
six months of 2009. Together with a weak capital account, this placed the tenge under significant
pressure. Kazakhstani banks also lost virtually all access to rollover opportunities in global
financial markets. Lower commodity prices worsened investment sentiment toward Kazakhstan.

26.      After the country lost US$6 billion dollars in defense of the tenge in January and
early February 2009, the National Bank conducted a one-off 20 percent devaluation of the
currency. While the devaluation proved effective in relieving pressure on the tenge and
stabilizing expectations, a weaker tenge unavoidably put additional pressure on the banking
sector as roughly half of the domestic loan portfolio was denominated in foreign currency.

27.     As the financial crisis deepened and the economy fell into recession in late 2008, the
Government tapped into its National Fund to finance an Anti-Crisis package of
US$lO billion. This package is summarized in Table 2. US$4 billion was spent on the
recapitalization of the four largest commercial banks through the purchase of ordinary (up to 25
percent ownership) and preferred shares. A small share of this sum was placed as deposits in the
two relatively less distressed banks to facilitate lending to the economy. The remaining
US$6 billion financed economic stimulus programs for construction, agriculture, real estate, small
business, and key infrastructure projects; the breakdown is given in Table 2. A large share of this
Anti-Crisis spending package was financed off-budget from National Fund resources through the
State holdings Samruk-Kazyna (See Box 1) and Kazagro, and was administered through larger
Kazakhstan i banks.

                            Box 1. The State Conglomerate Samruk-Kazyna

Samruk, Kazyna and Kazagro are the three key parastatals in Kazakhstan. They were established in 2006
by consolidating SOEs in industry, finance and agriculture, into the three holding companies. The objective
was to support growth in the manufacturing and agriculture, especially in high value added activities, with
the financial enterprises providing financial support to those activities.

Samruk-Kazyna was created according to a Government Decree of October 17,2008 through the merger of
two state holding companies Samruk (covered industrial enterprises) and Kazyna (covered financial
enterprises). These two holding companies were modeled on Singapore's Temasek with the objective of
investing in new industries with high value-added. The decision to merge Samruk and Kazyna was taken
as part of the anti-crisis initiative of the Government in an attempt to create a single large organization that
could effectively coordinate the anti-crisis measures simultaneously involving issues of Government
participation, management, and finance.
Samruk-Kazyna holds stakes of over 20 percent in 49 organizations. This includes 100 percent ownership
of the following important state companies: KazMunaigaz (oil and gas sector), Kazakhstan Termir Zholy
(railways), and KEGOC (electricity grid), as well as 46% of Kazakhtelekom (telecommunications).
Samruk-Kazyna also governs various state innovation, investment, and construction funds, the
Development Bank of Kazakhstan and, since February 2009, BTA and Alliance banks. It also holds
smaller minority shares in a number of other organizations, and has assets in its consolidated balance sheet
equal to more than 50 percent of GDP. It employs more than 250,000 people.

Samruk-Kazyna has a separate balance sheet from the Kazakhstan government. It pays taxes and dividends
to the state budget and National Fund, and uses its own budget to finance expenditures and service its
debts. In 2008, Samruk-Kazyna reported an after-tax profit of US$3.8 billion, 62 percent of which came
from Kazmunaigaz.
The board of directors of Samruk-Kazyna consists primarily of top Government officials (Prime Minister,

Samruk-Kazyna played important roles in realizing the Government's objectives in 2008-2009:
1. It directly financed US$4 billion dollars in anti-crisis stimulus spending. For this purpose, the
Government changed the rules governing the National Fund in a manner that allowed Samruk-Kazyna to
sell US$4 billion of its bonds to this Fund.
2. It implemented the Government's increased participation and influence over the management of the four
largest domestic banks, including the outright ownership of BTA and Alliance. In this capacity,
Samruk-Kazyna had representatives from the Government in the debt restructuring negotiations.
3. It attracted a significant amount of foreign h n d s that helped build confidence around the balance of
payments position of the country by mid-2009.
The decision to finance a large portion of the anti-crisis program in 2009 off-budget through
Samruk-Kazyna reflected the high priority at the time to insert the stimulus rapidly into an economy going
into a recession. In the wake of efforts to attract foreign funding in 2009, the consolidated foreign debt of
Samruk-Kazyna increased to an estimated US$20 billion by the end of the year. The majority of this
increase in debt concerns the acquisition by Samruk-Kazyna of additional assets in the oil and gas industry
(see paragraphs 53-54). Recent discussions in the Government have focused on regulations to limit the
debt position of Samruk-Kazvna, and a draft law is being discussed.

28.     The National Bank stepped up its liquidity support for commercial banks in late
2008 and 2009, while deposit insurance was increased seven-fold. By March 2009, reserve
requirements for commercial banks had been progressively decreased from 6 percent to
1.5 percent for internal liabilities, and from 8 percent to 2.5 percent for external liabilities.
Reverse REP0 operations were used for liquidity support (US$2.9 billion by the end of the third
quarter of 2009). The accounts of a number of state-owned organizations were also shifted from
the National Bank to commercial banks. As a measure to support depositor confidence,
household deposit insurance was increased seven-fold from 700 thousand tenge to 5 million tenge
(from US$5,833 to US$41,667).

29.      The Government also introduced measures to alleviate the social consequences of
the crisis. The Government protected social expenditures from budgetary sequestration, insured
all pension payments (including those from private pension funds) indexed to inflation, extended
unemployment benefits from four to six months, and promoted the signing of memoranda
between regional authorities and larger enterprises on preserving jobs. As of mid-2009,
memoranda with 5,2 15 enterprises employing 813,000 workers were reportedly signed. Special
shops selling subsidized food products and medicines to the poor which were set up during the
rapid food price increases in 2007-2008 continued to operate. In the spring of 2009, an additional
public works program of US$1.5 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) called the "Road Map" was set up
for the creation of jobs, training, and the provision of temporary wage subsidies to vulnerable
groups at the regional level through special budgetary transfers to local authorities. Public
salaries were increased significantly. The share of social spending in the consolidated
Government budget increased from 52 percent in 2008 to 60 percent in 2009.

30.       These measures lessened                    Figure 5. Unemployment Rate

household          incomes      and
unemployment. Positive growth in
2009 might not have been achieved
in the absence of the stimulus
programs.       Increases in public
salaries contributed directly to the
continuation of positive growth in
real average incomes in 2009 (+3%
for the first 10 months of the year),
even though a number of sectors did
experience real declines. Official
statistics suggest that Kazakhstan
has not experienced the same sort of
major increases in unemployment during the crisis as have many other countries. The official
unemployment rate (ILO definition) crept up to 7 percent but was brought down to 6.3 percent by
the end of 2009 (see Figure 5). Despite some disguised additional unemployment in the form of
"unpaid vacations" or layoffs of illegal migrant workers, this is nevertheless an important
accomplishment.

to the revenue decline. While
reducing capital and administrative expenditures, the implementation of higher social budgetary
commitments and off-budgetary stimulus spending discussed above, brought all state outlays up
to 29 percent of GDP (see Figure 6). The budget incurred a non-oil deficit (before guaranteed
transfer from the National Fund) of 10 percent of GDP. The guaranteed transfer from the
National Fund to the budget only covered half of this deficit, leaving an additional gap of 5
percent. The Government financed half of this gap through domestic borrowing. Given the low
absorption capacity of domestic markets and poor conditions for borrowing on international
markets, the Government also approved an additional (targeted) transfer from the National Fund
to the budget in 2009 of 1.6 percent of GDP, and borrowed US$500 million from the Asian
Development Bank.

32.      Instead of the initial plan to recapitalize the four largest banks by buying minority
shares, the Government decided to seize control of BTA and Alliance on February 2, 2009,
while going ahead with the minority equity injection into the other two banks. The
downward spiral in real estate prices and the imminent devaluation of the tenge implied that the
approved recapitalization package for BTA and Alliance of October 2008 would be insufficient.
Consequently, the authorities feared that the remaining assets of these banks might be in
jeopardy. BTA had severe liquidity problems and, being the biggest bank in Kazakhstan at the
time, its failure had systemic implications. On February 2, 2009, the Government decided to
acquire control of BTA through a share issue, purchased by the state holding company,
Samruk-Kazyna. For Alliance, the authorities took control without outright ownership through an
escrow arrangement. The audits that followed nationalization confirmed fears of the Government
that their actual remaining assets were considerably less than had been reported.

33.      The Government is actively pursuing the recapitalization of BTA and Alliance
through substantial foreign debt restructuring. Following the acquisition of the two problem
banks, the Government kept these banks current on their foreign debt obligations. However, two
international creditors, who had more than hedged their exposure to the banks in the CDS market,
called an acceleration clause in their contracts, citing change of ownership. The Government did
not wish to honor such debt acceleration and give preferential treatment to individual creditors.
BTA and Alliance subsequently fell into default, pending negotiations to restructure their foreign
debts. The Government's position was that foreign creditors, who channeled unsecured private
loans to BTA and Alliance at their own risk, should share a significant share of the losses. The
Government also deemed it important to give a strong signal to financial markets that it does not
implicitly insure private unsecured credits. As oil output and exports are due to double in the first
half of this century, such a strong signal is seen as necessary for avoiding speculative capital
inflows in the future.


                                                    - 12-
34.      While restructuring negotiations proved more lengthy and complicated than
expected, they have had success. The Government (through state holding Samruk-Kazyna)
finally achieved general terms agreements with committees of foreign creditors for Alliance bank
(October, 2009) and BTA (December, 2009). These agreements prescribed average haircuts of
roughly 75% (Alliance) and 60% (BTA) to foreign creditors, and gave some preferential
treatment to trade credits. This provides for writing off roughly US$IO billion dollars of the
foreign debts of these banks. These general memoranda were not binding for individual creditors.
For the case of Alliance, a subsequent binding terms agreement was reached in December with a
qualified majority of creditors that confirmed the general terms of the October memorandum. A
similar agreement is expected for BTA in 2010.

35.      The interventions helped to maintain financial stability and stabilized credit to the
private sector, but they also increased fiscal risk and cost of restoring the banking sector to
health. As shown in Table 2, the Kazakhstan authorities have provided direct equity and debt
financing of close to US$11 billion (10 percent of GDP) to the banking sector since the outset of
the crisis. Credit to the private sector has remained almost flat since the interventions, and CDS
spreads have come down to 550-800 bps for the two largest banks (now Halyk Bank and KKB)
from more than 3,000 in the summer of 2009. The interventions were successful in maintaining
depositor confidence in the rest of the system, although depositors did leave BTA and Alliance
after the intervention. Liquidity injections continued after the nationalization, most notably as
facilitated by a bond swap between Samruk-Kazyna and BTA, which further increased fiscal
risks. Samruk-Kazyna received bonds in BTA in exchange for its own bonds, which the banks in
turn could pledge to the National Bank for liquidity. The bonds that Samruk-Kazyna received in
the two banks will now be converted into equity according to the current restructuring plan.
Thus, the fiscal costs will remain uncertain until a post-restructuring market value of the bank can
be established.

36.     The banking sector appears on track for a gradual recovery but it remains
vulnerable to external shocks. Fortunately, Halyk Bank, the former state savings bank that
holds a large share of consumer deposits, pursued a more cautious credit strategy than the other
large banks during the boom, and appears to be in relatively good shape. KKB, which is now the
largest bank in Kazakhstan, has serious problems on the asset side of its balance sheet
(23.5 percent NPLs), but the bank pursued a strategy of holding provisions and reserves well in
excess of prudential requirements (1 08 percent provisions, CAR of 15 percent). KKB remained
current on its foreign debt obligations in late 2009 (US$800 million), and is thus expected to do
so for substantially lower debt servicing requirements in 2010. Given the remaining difficulties
on the asset sides of bank portfolios and limited opportunities to attract resources, the current
recovery in liquidity, profitability, and lending will likely be slow and gradual.

        B.       MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

37.     The pace of economic growth is likely to remain modest, given the projected pace of
global recovery and the revival of credit markets. According to base case assumptions,
Kazakhstan's growth is projected to increase slowly, starting at around 2 percent in 2010 and
surpassing 3 percent only in 2012. Commodity prices are strengthening, which augurs well for
investments and exports in the resource sectors, and construction and services. The banking
sector is still being restructured, with many banks burdened by a significant stock of non-
performing loans. While recent reforms and restructuring will expedite recovery, modest
economic growth and limited liquidity suggest that the revival of bank credit will likely be slow.
Until Kashagan comes on stream in 2014, the oil sector should experience little growth. After



                                               - 13 -
2014, growth should pick up and oil revenues should rise, strengthening Kazakhstan's external
sector outlook (see Figure 7 ) .

38.      Higher growth over the near term will depend on inflows of private foreign
investment, primarily to the resource sectors. With the gradual strengthening of commodity
prices, private investments in and exports of the mining sector (large deposits of copper, zinc,
tungsten, uranium, and coal) are expected to pick up, and important Kashagan-related
investments will continue. Public investments are also expected to remain robust over this
period. These investments and export-related inflows will stimulate demand and a mild recovery
of (particularly) the non-tradable sectors (e.g. construction, services, trade, transport, etc.)

39.      In tradables, agriculture has better potential to grow than manufacturing in the
near term. Agriculture accounts for a rather small share of GDP (6%) and exports (4%),
although its significance for Kazakhstan is greater than these figures would suggest. Roughly one
third of the population lives in rural areas, thus making agriculture important for living standards.
In addition, high quality grain exports from the northern part of the country give Kazakhstan at
least one important niche on export markets outside of the resource sectors. The agriculturally
rich southern territory also has potential, although infrastructure problems (an inadequate
irrigation system), organizational constraints (small farm size), and poorly functioning land
markets constrain growth. The Government can facilitate the development of agriculture in the
south by reallocating a share of current outlays on input subsides to productivity-enhancing
investments in infrastructure and other areas, promoting the development of land markets, and
implementing a strategy for farm consolidation that provides greater migration opportunities to
urban areas for redundant rural workers.

40.      In manufacturing, Kazakhstan has already achieved some export success in steel
and processed metals. Other areas remain problematic, with relatively low productivity and
high production costs making competition with neighboring countries difficult. The Government
has targeted certain areas that would appear to have better prospects, including the food industry,
oil and resource refinement, and construction materials.

41.      The Government hopes that the current economic environment and reform agenda
will unlock sources of economic growth in non-resource tradable sectors of the economy.
The diversification agenda proved difficult in the face of booming commodity prices leading into
the crisis. The current situation presents opportunities for growth that is slower but perhaps more


                                                      - 14-
sustainable. The Government has aimed a number of recent policies and reforms at improving
the environment for private entrepreneurs, who have the potential to lead more diversified
growth. This includes a major tax reform that lowered the tax burden in the non-resource sectors
of the economy and other programs to improve the business climate.

42.       T h e fiscal stimulus will be phased out gradually. The modest growth projected in
Table 4 assumes the level of fiscal spending programmed in the three-year budget. The recently
approved three-year rolling budget for 201 0-2012 reflects a gradual withdrawal of the fiscal
stimulus. Following the exceptionally high expenditures (on and off-budget) in 2008 and 2009,
the Government plans to reduce budgetary expenditures down to around 25 percent of GDP
during the next three years. The non-oil deficit will decline from its peak levels in 2008-2009,
but still remain above pre-crisis levels as non-oil revenue is projected at lower levels, due in part
to the continued impact of the tax reform of 2009 and some new (primarily social) budgetary
commitments of a permanent nature. The phasing out of the fiscal stimulus will depend on the
pace of recovery of growth and of non-oil revenue, which remain uncertain.

 43.     The annual transfer from the NF to the budget in 2010 to finance the deficit is
 limited to $8 billion or around 6.9 percent of GDP, leaving a financing gap of 4.6 percent of
 GDP. The Government is committed to avoid using the NF for additional transfers, in order to
 signal the end of easy access and reestablish discipline in its future use relative to 2008-09 (see
 para 72 for the reasons for the size of limit). It thus plans to borrow both domestically and
 externally to finance the gap. The current financing plan for 2010 envisages domestic and
 external borrowing, the latter in the form of Eurobonds or Islamic bonds as well as budget
 support from the World Bank (0.8 percent of GDP). Kazakhstan's public and publicly guaranteed
 debt, external and domestic, amounted to only 10 percent of GDP at the end of 2009, planned
 borrowing for financing the non-oil deficit from both domestic and external markets should
 increase total debt to less than 20 percent by 2012.

US$47.5 billion (see Figure
8). The strengthening of the balance of payments came from both the current and capital
accounts. Higher commodity prices and a substantial import contraction following the February
devaluation of the tenge transformed an estimated current account deficit of US$3.5 billion in the
first half of 2009 into a US$97 million surplus in the second half of the year. Strong inflows of
foreign direct investment in the second half of the year contributed to an estimated capital
account surplus of US$2.4 billion for the year. Thus, preliminary balance of payments data
indicate only a slight BOP deficit for the year of US$287 million. The balance of payments has
remained in surplus in early 2010, as indicated in the additional accumulation of gross monetary
and National Fund foreign reserves of US$4 billion.

Risks and debt sustainability

45.      Public debt levels are projected to remain low, despite higher non-oil fiscal deficits
and public borrowing to finance that deficit. The Ministry of Finance plans total Government
borrowing to be 4.6 percent, 3.6 percent, and 3.8 percent of GDP in 2010, 201 1, and 2012
respectively, based on the three-year budget approved by parliament. Under the base case
scenario of oil at around $76-80, total public debt is projected to remain under 20 percent of GDP
at the end of 2012, then increase to 23 percent by 2015 (see Table 6). The National Fund will
grow at the same time, keeping the Government's net financial position positive at 9 percent of
GDP in 2015. The base case scenario is also consistent with maintaining current account
surpluses over the period in question, which makes the country less vulnerable to changes in
capital flows.

46.      If oil prices remain higher than our base scenario, as is the case now, debt ratios will
be lower and accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and NF resources will be higher.
Non-oil revenue is likely to be higher due to the indirect effects on the economy. Higher inflows
from oil exports will increase demand, growth, profits and tax revenues. Also, other commodity
prices are correlated with oil, and those sectors of the economy would strengthen. If Government
spending remains as budgeted, non-oil deficit will be lower, but most of this positive non-oil
revenue effect will take until next year to be evident. The annual transfer to the budget from the
NF will, however, not change from $8 billion, even as NF accumulates reserves, and thus the gap
in financing the 2010 non-oil deficit is unlikely to change relative to those budgeted by the
Government.




                                                - 17-
47.     Volatility in commodity prices still poses a risk. This is evident in the projections for
the case of oil at US$50 a banel in Table 6. Under this scenario, the Government's net financial
position deteriorates to an estimated negative 10 percent of GDP by 2015. This is still arguably a
reasonable and sustainable position, especially given the prospects of Kashagan oil. But this
scenario also implies probable current account deficits of 2-3 percent of GDP annually, which
could make financial stability dependent on capital account inflows at a time when low
commodity prices and (most likely) continuing world financial crisis would adversely affect
investor sentiment toward the country.

48.     In the low oil price scenario, a further delay in the Kashagan project could tighten
external constraints on the country. This project has faced past delays due to complicated
technical and environmental issues and underestimation of costs, but has addressed them and is
now largely on track; all funding and FDI are fully committed and available for the project to
come on line in 2014 and double output by 2020. If unanticipated complications of oil extraction
or pipeline expansion do cause further delays, they do not affect the fiscal outlook for the near
term. The same is true for the medium term in the base case scenario, as the fiscal outlook is
consistent with a strong net financial position of the Government through 2020, even with further
delay. In the low-oil-price scenario, however, Table 6 shows that maintaining public
expenditures at their current levels would involve a measurable weakening in the Government's
net financial position. In this case, significant delays in output and exports from the Kashagan
project could tighten external conditions for Kazakhstan, requiring possible adjustments in public
spending.

49.     Although sovereign debt is low, Kazakhstan's overall external debt is 104 percent of
GDP. However, 40 percent of this debt represents intrafirm obligations, primarily those of
daughter firms operating in the resource industries to their parent foreign affiliates. Sovereign
debt accounts for a relatively small share of foreign debt (2.4 percent). The foreign obligations of
the Kazakhstan banking sector remain significant at US$30 billion, although significantly down
from the US$46 billion at the outset of the crisis in mid-2007. Successful debt restructuring of
BTA and Alliance in 2010, together with continued scheduled repayments, should bring the
outstanding debt of the Kazakhstan banking sector to below US$20 billion by the end of the year.
The large state holding Samruk-Kazyna would appear to account for roughly 60 percent of the
corporate foreign debt of the country (see Table 7).

50.       A low case scenario could also put pressures on the budget from contingent
liabilities. Some of the most significant fiscal costs of the crisis concern contingent liabilities
associated with distress in the banking sector. A low case scenario for the world economy and
commodity prices could impose additional fiscal costs on the country through contingent
liabilities associated with the banking sector or other areas. Important sources of contingent
liabilities other than the banking sector include private pension funds, the assets of which account
for 12 percent of GDP, and the debts of large state-owned enterprises under the umbrella of
Samruk-Kazyna. These latter debts could also become potentially problematic in the event of a
sustained collapse in commodity prices.

5 1.     Primary contingent liabilities in the banking sector include explicit obligations for
deposit insurance, and implicit obligations associated with foreign liabilities of large banks.
The stock of insured individual deposits in Kazakhstan amounts to US$12.8 billion (12 percent of
GDP). The primary contingent liabilities for the Government can be associated with the four
systemically large banks, namely, BTA, Alliance, KKB, and Halyk. The remaining commercial
banks are either owned by large international banking groups or small enough to be liquidated,
leaving only the risk of covering a modest deposit base, and thus do not pose much of a risk in the
way of contingent liabilities. Therefore, the most important are the foreign liabilities of BTA and
Alliance banks, which are estimated at roughly US$14 billion and US$4.6 billion, but under
current restructuring agreements should be reduced to 60 and 75 percent of the original debt,
respectively. The remaining two systemically important domestic banks, KKB and Halyk, have
foreign obligations totalling a little over US$6 billion, In the event of a negative shock to the
economy, at least some of those contingent liabilities may become explicit liabilities.

52.       In state-owned enterprises, the relevant contingent liabilities relate to the large
Government holding company Samruk-Kazyna. Under the Kazakhstan "Law on Joint Stock
Companies" of 2003, the balances of state-owned enterprises are separate from the state budget,
and the Government bears no explicit responsibility for bailouts. Despite numerous corporate
defaults in 2008-2009, the Government did not offer any corporate bailouts. Thus, contingent
liabilities posed by debts of most state-owned enterprises are limited but that may not be the case
with debts of a few large state-owned enterprises of systemic importance like under Samruk-
Kazyna [i.e. KazMunaigaz (oil and gas sector), Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (railways), KEGOC
(electricity grid), Kazakhtelecom]. The consolidated foreign debt of Samruk-Kazyna reached an
estimated US$20 billion by the end of 2009.

53.     Most of the US$15 billion increase in foreign debt of Samruk-Kazyna durin
2008-09 relates to the debt of the state oil and gas conglomerate, Kazmunaigaz.               F
Kazmunaigaz obtained over US$I 1 billion of this debt, with US$4.6 billion from Eurobond
issues and another estimated US$7 billion in credit from China. This debt funded an increase of
the Government stake in the Kashagan oil project, the construction of oil and gas pipelines to

China, and the acquisition of stakes in two other oil-related firms as part of co-investment deals
with Chinese investors. A large share of the Chinese credit requires no current debt servicing,
and is expected to be repaid out of future profits from the respective projects. In addition,
Samruk-Kazyna's debt also increased from a Chinese loan of US$4.2 billion to the Kazakhstan
Development Bank that is being used for priority infrastructure and investment projects in various
sectors of the economy, but the disbursement of these funds has so far been only a fraction of the
announced loan amount.

54.      The Government has begun to monitor the rising debt position of Samruk-Kazyna
closely, even if most of it is for oil and gas holdings. Debt service amounted to roughly
5 percent of the total revenues of Samruk-Kazyna in 2008. Kazmunaigaz is a well endowed
enterprise with significant earnings; it owns 44 of the oil and gas deposits, is responsible for 65
percent of the transportation of oil on Kazakhstan territory, and owns oil refineries in Kazakhstan,
Romania, and Georgia. In 2008, the revenues of Kazmunaigaz were US$22 billion, and after-tax
profits were US$2.4 billion, or 62 percent of Samruk-Kazyna's consolidated after-tax profit.
Revenue and profit figures for Kazmunaigaz fell to an estimated US$14 billion and US$I billion,
respectively, in 2009 in the face of low oil prices; but both revenues and profits are projected to
increase substantially in 2010. However, debt servicing obligations are not expected to rise in
line with the rise in debt, as a significant part of the Chinese loans have a generous grace period
and will be financed from the projects themselves. Debt servicing obligations from the increased
debt will still rise over the medium-term. Partly for this reason, the Government has requested a
high-level brainstorming with the World Bank sometime in 20 10 on ways to institutionalize
monitoring and managing external debt of SOEs, with attention to the experience of other
countries.

55.      Private pension funds also represent contingent liabilities for the Government.
Although the law does not oblige the Government to bail out private pension funds, it does
require insuring payments corresponding to obligatory 2"d tier contributions. Article 6 of the
"Law on Pension Provision" of 1997 (latest revisions made on December 2, 2009) requires that
the Government guarantee obligatory contributions to the 2ndtier pension system, indexed to
inflation.     In 2010, these obligatory contributions amounted to 35.5 billion tenge
(US$237 million). These annual payments are due to increase over the medium term, and could
reach 110 billion tenge (US$733 million) by 2020. The stock of all obligatory contributions
made to the 2"dtier of the pension system, which are insured by the Government, currently stands
at US$12.8 billion. Private pension funds currently have 41.6 percent of their assets invested in
state bonds, while securities of domestic private entities account for 36.8 percent of assets, and
securities of foreign entities comprise 11 percent. Almost all non-government assets are in the
form of bonds denominated in foreign currency. The Government hopes that regulatory changes
and a larger stock of Government securities will reduce banking sector and foreign currency risks
for pension funds.

      111.    THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND CONSULTATION PROCESS

56.      The fiscal stimulus program and structural reforms seek to promote growth and
protect the living standards of the population. Shifts in the composition of public spending
towards more social spending, with direct support to agriculture and SMEs, will alleviate social
distress and promote growth. Reforms will focus mainly on public resource management
(including the NF) and the financial sector, especially over the next two years, while other
initiatives to lessen administrative barriers for businesses, and to improve the prospects for
agriculture and other priority non-extractive sectors, are planned as part of the strategy.


                                               -21 -
57.      Kazakhstan's development strategy emphasizes not only oil and mining, but also
growth in other sectors. In 2003, the Government adopted the National Strategy for Industrial
Innovation and Development (NSIID 2003-15) which emphasized the legislative and institutional
foundations for economic diversification. In January 201 0, the Government approved a Strategic
Plan for Development of Kazakhstan Until 2020, which commits to increasing the primacy of the
private sector by making the country more competitive, by attracting more foreign investment in
non-oil and non mineral sectors, and by increasing the share of output from small and medium
enterprises in the economy. This Strategic Plan aims to transform Kazakhstan into one of the 50
most competitive countries in the world; it targets an increase in FDI inflows by another 10
percent of GDP and an increase in the share of investment in non-extractive sectors to 30 percent
of all fixed capital investment by 2020. Poverty rates are projected to fall by 20 percent. The
Strategy also includes an explicit diversification program of "induced industrialization" that will
be concentrated in the agro-industrial complex, oil refinement, and other priority areas.

58.     Kazakhstan's growth has been driven mainly by the expansion of the oil and mining
sectors, as well as nontradables, with the non-extractive tradable sectors' contribution being
limited. Early reforms to open up the economy attracted large inflows of foreign direct
investment, but more than ninety percent of it went into the extractive sectors. Oil and mineral
export revenue expanded more than tenfold between 2000 and 2008 due to rising output, exports
and world prices, and comprises nearly 85 percent of total exports. Continued new investments
in the Kashagan project and mining in the coming years, as commodity prices firm up with global
recovery, will contribute to growth although oil output will remain largely unchanged until
Kashagan comes on stream in 20 14. Actual diversification towards non-extractive tradables has
been relatively limited, although agriculture and agricultural exports have been somewhat of an
exception.

59.      Diversification is a major challenge in an oil economy, and Kazakhstan's geography
compounds the challenge. Fiscal policy with a stable GDP share of total public spending has
been relatively prudent, though private sector demand grew quite rapidly during 2005-07. This,
together with government efforts to sterilize large capital inflows, limited the real exchange rate
appreciation to 20 percent between 2000 and 2008 (period average). This appreciation has
rendered tradable manufactures and agricultural items less competitive relative to other countries.
In addition to being landlocked and sparsely populated, the country faces high time and cost of
transporting goods both within the country and across borders. Significant investments in roads,
rail and transport services are necessary to ensure competitiveness.

60.      The Government's immediate focus is on policy areas made urgent because of the
crisis. Strengthening public resource management, especially prudent management of oil wealth,
and addressing vulnerabilities of the financial sector, are pre-requisites for diversification and
growth. Fiscal policy has to be consistent with maintaining competitiveness. The recovery of
domestic credit and better allocation of credit will be key to all sectors, including non-extractive
sectors. Given the heightened importance of fiscal discipline and financial sector stability,
reforms are appropriately focused on better use and governance of oil revenues, on increasing
transparency and efficiency of public expenditures, and on addressing financial sector
vulnerabilities. The emphasis is on continuing to support economic activity and alleviate social
distress, and thus a gradual withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus accompanied by these reforms. As
domestic credit recovers, other efforts at diversification will gain importance.

6 1.   This section provides an overview of the Government's program in the following
key areas: (a) reorienting public spending as part of the fiscal stimulus, (b) strengthening
management of the country's oil wealth, (c) reforming budgetary management to increase


                                               - 22 -
efficiency, (d) addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector, and (e) encouraging
diversification and equitable growth.

Reorienting public spending as part offiscal stimulus

62.      The Government has been reorienting public expenditures to reflect national
priorities at several levels. First, there is a continuing reduction in administrative expenditures
and in budget and off-budget stimulus spending that correspond to production subsidies of
various forms. Second, a large share of the resources freed by these cuts is being added to social
sector spending, and planned social sector spending reviews will help gauge the ineffectiveness
and redirect as necessary. Third, more of the stimulus is being spent on public works and training
at the local level to promote local level employment and employability. Fourth, public spending
on agriculture and manufacturing, including infrastructure and direct support, will continue to be
aimed at fostering non-oil growth.

63.     The cuts were in spending on Government administration and on the component of
state enterprise transfers going to production subsidies. Table 8 shows the increase in share
of social expenditures between 2008 and 20 10. Anti-crisis production subsidies in the budget
were cut in 2009, including support for housing construction, agriculture and SME loan
refinancing. Most of these cuts are being maintained in 20 10-2012.

64.      These reductions were mostly reallocated to social sector spending. The increases
went mostly into higher pensions but a part also went to higher wages and salaries for teachers,
medical practitioners, and other public sector employees in these sectors. Teachers, medical
practitioners, and other public employees are some of the lowest paid people, and many count
among the poor (see Box 2). The effectiveness of this additional spending in terms of impact on



                                                        - 23 -
social service delivery is unclear, and planned studies on social sector spending reviews will help
to improve the effectiveness of such spending over time.

65.     A central element of the strategy to improve public service is movement towards a
smaller gap in wages between the public and private sectors to attract quality personnel.
Partly for this reason the Government has been increasing public sector wages gradually in recent
years. Even with these increases, the gaps are still large with respect to private sector wages and
wages relative to per capita GDP in other countries (Figure 1.1). The policy of gradually
increasing public sector wages, while maintaining significant wage differentials, is part of the
large scale move towards strengthening of the results orientation of the public sector, seen as
important for improving public service delivery to the population.

                 Box 2. Wages and Headcount Poverty Rate of Public Sector Employees
                                     in the Aftermath of the Crisis

 The poverty rate in households of public sector employees in urban areas is higher than that of private
 sector employees, particularly after a large increase in poverty in 2008 among this group (see table
 below). The poverty rate in this group was 12.1 percent in 2008, compared with 9.0 percent in
 households headed by a private sector employee. In 2006, the poverty rate among households headed by
 a private and public sector employees was almost the same around 15 percent, but between 2006 and
 2008 poverty declined much more rapidly among the private sector category.

66.      The Government plans to sustain the level of social spending at around 60 percent
of total expenditures while it seeks to improve its efficiency and enhance its impact and
targeting. This increased level is viewed as needed not only because spending in education has
been lower than in comparable countries and the strategy for non-oil growth requires greater
attention to it, but also because the demands on social assistance remain high during this period of
slow growth. However, the Government has initiated several pieces of joint technical work with
the Bank in social sector spending reviews (health is nearing completion) and design and
upgrading of targeted social protection in an effort to rationalize the composition of spending and
increase its efficiency. Success in this respect as well as recovery of growth will support a
gradual reduction in this share of spending.

67.      The Government has introduced a new `Road Map' program, most of which is
devoted to public works to support employment and local infrastructure. The program has
four primary objectives: (a) the creation of jobs, (b) the renovation of local infrastructure, (c)
improving the qualifications of workers, and (d) the pilot use in Kazakhstan of a co-financing
model that stimulates initiatives at the sub-national level. Based on an assessment of the greatest
employment risks in the country by region, the Road Map allocated 140 billion tenge (US$933
million) in transfers to the sub-national (oblast) administrations. These transfers were deposited
to co-finance programs, together with the regional budgets, for creating jobs in the renovation of
local roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities, as well as for the training and retraining of workers.
Some provisions were also made for the creation of "social jobs," which offer 50 percent co-
financing of the salaries of selected target groups and youth internships. The supported projects
were identified by the regions themselves, but they were subject to review and approval by
relevant ministries. The Government is continuing the Road Map program in 2010 on the basis
of 100 billion tenge from the Republican budget as a major priority (see Annex VI1 for details).

Strengthening public resource management

68.      Kazakhstan's efforts at strengthening public resource management, which began in
2000, got a new impetus during the crisis. The Government's program emphasizes increasing
discipline and transparency in the management of oil revenues, including the NF. In that context,

Kazakhstan has adopted new rules for the NF and initiated a joint Government-World Bank study
for refining the rules further on the basis of international good practices. In addition, the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is being implemented for both oil and mining
sectors. Finally, reforms to increase the efficiency of budgetary management and expenditures
will be timely given the stimulus and its planned gradual phase-out.

                        Box 3. The National Fund (NF) of the Republic of Kazakhstan
The ultimate authority for the management and uses of the National Fund is the President of Kazakhstan. The
Kazakhstan Budget Code specifies that decisions regarding size, uses, and rules of the National Fund are to be taken on
the authority of the President. The President also appoints the Managerial Board of the NF, which currently includes
the Prime Minister, Parliament Chairman, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Economy.

Legal rules
In accordance with the Budget Code, which has the force of national law, the Government of Kazakhstan and the
National Bank submit an annual report on the activities of the National Fund. This report is audited by an independent
auditor selected through competitive bidding, and audited reports are published in the mass media. The annual reports
for the National Fund can also be found on the website of the Ministry of Finance, together with monthly reports on
activities associated with the Fund: httu:l/www.minfin.kziindeu.Dho?uin=l 120634759Nclan~=rus

The Budget Code spells out basic rules surrounding the formation and uses of the National Fund:

          The National Fund is a separate entity from the Republican budget. Oil-related tax revenues from an official
          list of companies (currently 169) accrue directly to the National Fund, as opposed to the state budget.
          The Republican budget receives an annual "guaranteed transfer" from the National Fund for financing the
          non-oil deficit. The size of this transfer is determined on a three-year basis by the Government, and
          subsequently issued as a law. The Budget Code forbids the size of the guaranteed transfer to exceed one third
          of the size of the fund.
          The President has the right to approve additional special purpose transfers to the budget from the NF, called
          targeted transfers.
          The Managerial Board can recommend adjustments in the list of permissible assets that can be held by the
          NF, subject to approval by the Government and National Bank. The first (2004) version of the Budget Code
          specified that the N F could only hold foreign assets, but this condition was removed in the 2008 revision of
          the Budget Code.
          The National Bank is entrusted with managing the portfolio of the NF, including contracting with external
          fund managers through competitive bidding.

Practice
Prior to 2008, the Republican budget received only a single annual guaranteed transfer from the National Fund that
approximately financed the expected non-oil budget deficit. N o additional special purpose transfers were approved by
the President and the NF held only foreign assets. Between 2001 and 2008 the Government saved on average about
half of the annual oil revenue proceeds in the National Fund, with the gross saving rate reaching its peak at 75 percent
in 2007 when oil prices hit record highs.

During the crisis of 2008-2009, the President approved special purpose transfers, including for the recapitalization of
banks (2008) and financing the Road Map public works program (2009). As a result of these higher financing needs
combined with revenues being depressed by the fall in the oil price, the gross saving rate in oil revenues fell to 20
percent in 2009. In addition, following the above-mentioned change in the Budget Code, the securities of state
holdings Samruk-Kazyna and Kazagro were added to the list of permissible assets that can be held by the NF. Samruk
Kazyna and Kazagro then sold their bonds to the N F in 2009 for a total of US$5 billion for financing the Anti-Crisis
package. This gave rise to strong pressures by other domestic interest groups to expand the use of the N F for domestic
investments.

69.      The NF was used in a disciplined manner until 2008 and 2009, when exceptional
uses of its resources were authorized on and off-budget to respond to the crisis. The NF was
established in 2000 both to protect the budget and the economy from volatility in oil prices and to
provide a national savings vehicle for transforming part of the country's oil wealth into a
diversified portfolio of financial wealth. As of end-2008, the size of this fund stood at
US$27 billion. Between 2000 and 2007, the NF only made a single annual transfer to the state
budget for financing the non-oil deficit, and accumulated the remaining oil revenues. In 2008 and
2009, additional transfers to the budget were approved and, for the first time, the NF was
authorized, to purchase domestic assets (bonds of Samruk-Kazyna and Kazagro), thereby
providing finance for off-budgetary expenses.

70.      Cross-country rankings suggest that the governance arrangements of the NF, with
respect to transparency and disclosure policies, compare well to Sovereign Wealth Funds in
other emerging market countries, but need to be improved to fully comply with best practice.
The NF scores a 6 (out of a possible 10) in the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute's (independent
international NGO) Transparency rating, higher than some countries in the region but lower than
the benchmark rating (8) which reflects adequate transparency arrangements. Another
independent ranking of 31 such funds by the Peterson Institute ranks the National Fund IOth,
again higher than others but considerably lower than the best practice countries, such as Norway,
Chile, and Australia. There is room for improvements to move towards the best practice
countries.

71.    To re-establish discipline the President and the Government imposed new rules for
the NF. The Presidential Decree is consistent with the President's ultimate authority over the
NF. Under these rules:
      e   the size of the annual guaranteed transfer to the budget is fixed for ten years at the
          equivalent of US$8 billion;
      e   no additional targeted (special purpose) transfer will be approved by the President; and
      e   the National Fund is not permitted to acquire additional domestic assets and through it
          finance off-budget expenditure.

72.       The choice of US$8 billion was made for practical reasons. The rationale is:

      e   it corresponds to the size of the annual transfer programmed in the three-year budget
          approved;
      e   it brings the Gross Saving Rate from oil revenue back to about 50 percent, thereby
          accelerating the accumulation of precautionary savings in the NF (at current price levels
          of US$75-80 per barrel and with expected increases in production volumes); and
      e   it forces the Government to become less dependent on oil revenues as the size of the
          transfer relative to GDP and the budget declines over time.
73.      The Government is planning to refine these rules in line with international good
practice, and a joint technical study with the World Bank is underway. This joint work will
examine specific questions that are part of the terms of reference agreed with the Government.
First, building on the prudent management of the NF, the work will examine good practices for
improving transparency and accountability of Fund management. Second, the new statutory
ceiling on the annual transfers at US$8 billion limits current consumption of oil revenues, but its
overall impact will depend on how the fixed annual transfer interacts with other fiscal aggregates,
namely, non-oil revenue, expenditures, and the non-oil deficit. Therefore, the size of the annual


                                                - 27 -
transfer from the National Fund to the budget will be reviewed in the context of the long-run
fiscal and debt sustainability framework. Third,in the event of another fiscal shock, the current
rules may prove too rigid; this work will examine the best practices of countries to assess options
for more durable and flexible rules along with institutionally sound mechanisms to authorize the
use of NF resources under exceptional circumstances such as the recent crisis.

                 Box 4. Best Practice in Management of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF)
                                       and the National Fund (NF)
 This Box summarizes the practices of SWFs, including best practices, in respect of the five dimensions of sound
 management and governance, together with an indication of where Kazakhstan's N F stands in respect of those
 dimensions. Cooperative technical work with the World Bank for refining the rules of the N F will also be
 examining these five dimensions.

 Governance o Sovereign Wealth Funds
             f

 The five dimensions of sound management include, inter alia (i) a clear legal framework that lays the ground rules
 for the operation of the SWF. (ii) disclosure policies, including issuance of an annual financial report and
 independent audit, (iii) delineation of clear roles and responsibilities in the management of the fund with a
 separation between ownership and operational management roles, (iv) clear accountability arrangements. and
 (v) integration of budgetary use of funds with fiscal policy.

 In practice, arrangements differ widely across countries:

     Legal framework: As a legal matter, most funds are established by statute but they may be created by
     Constitutional amendment (Alaska), by law (for example Chile, Norway, Ireland) governmental decree
     (Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kuwait), or simply by action of the government under existing legislation, e.g. public
     companies law (China Investment Corporation, Temasek). Some legal forms such as the Constitutional
     Amendment in Alaska or laws that require a super-majority may give the fund more permanence and protection
     from future governmental changes. In spite of these variations, almost all legal instruments address the same
     subjects: Purposes of the fund, investment policy, guidelines, management authority, auditing and publication
     of accounts, contribution and withdrawal rules.

     The legal basis for the National Fund is promulgated by national law (the budget code), however, key structural
     arrangements, including those related to the withdrawal and deposit rules, are regulated through Presidential
     decree potentially making them more vulnerable to sudden policy reversals.

     Disclosure policies: Best practice SWFs issue detailed annual reports providing complete financial statements
     (Balance Sheet, PIL Statements) along side with reports on investment strategy, portfolio and risk management.
     External audits are in most cases performed by independent, internationally-recognized accounting firms. Few
     SWFs have their accounts audited by Auditor Generals, another independent government agency or the
     Ministry of Finance itself (Norway). Audit procedures include an evaluation of the fund's administration, a
     review of the Board's judgments and decisions, and an assessment of financial and management controls.
     SWFs put emphasis on the temporary appointment of the external auditing entity to ensure independence,
     regularity of the audit (usually annually), the availability of audited reports to the public and compliance with
     the International Auditing Standards. Most of Sovereign Wealth Funds have websites containing information
     on Fund's goals, structure, management, investment portfolio, and financial reports.

     The National Fund mostly complies with international best practice. It issues comprehensive financial reports
     that are audited by an international audit firm and published on the MoF website. Reporting could, however, be
     improved by complementing financial statements with narrative information about the inflowsioutflows,
     investment decisions and real return.

     Separation of ownership and operational management: Some SWFs are set up as separate entities (Temasek
     in Singapore, China Investment Corporation, Korea Investment Corporation), while others are essentially
     managed as pools of state-owned financial assets, typically controlled by the MoF and managed by the Central
     Bank (Pula Fund in Botswana, Timor Leste) or a statutory management agency (Alberta Heritage Savings
     Fund, Ireland National Pensions Reserve Fund). With few exceptions (e.g. Norway), implementation of
     investment strategies is outsourced.




                                                        - 28 -
     The National Fund complies with international best uractice. The fund is owned bv the MoF and ouerational
     management is delegated to the NBK. Like most countries, the management of ;he investment pbrtfolio is
     outsourced to external fund managers, e.g. investment banks.

     Accountability: Existing SWFs report either to a supervisory council, the Minister of Finance, the Parliament
     or an elected official (President). Some SWFs governing bodies consist of trustees, representing people with
     substantial expertise and experience at a senior level in business, civil society and public fields and separated
     from the government (Ireland, Alaska), and others have bodies that consist of representatives of relevant
     governmental authorities appointed by the President (Kazakhstan, Azerbai.ian).

    The accountability arrangements for the National Fund are consistent with the political system of Kazakhstan
    that gives quite significant power to the President. The high degree of ultimate presidential authority over the
    NF is viewed by some at the present time as an important counterbalance to strong populist pressures.
    Kazakhstan might consider introducing future arrangements with more checks and balances in the governance
    of the fund to move towards international best practice.

     Integration with fiscal policy: The SWFs in commodity producing countries are tools to manage natural
     resource revenues so as to achieve fiscal policy objectives, e.g. fiscal sustainability, countercyclical
     stabilization, intergenerational equity, and so on. This ensures that reserve accumulation in the SWF is driven
     by medium-term objectives rather than by revenue availability, while ensuring any withdrawal from the fund
     responds to budgetary needs. In cases of good practice, there is full integration with fiscal policy, e.g. in Chile
     and Norway, the operation of the SWF is guided by the overall fiscal policy stance which is anchored by some
     target (as a matter of fiscal policy or a permanent fiscal rule) for the primary budget balance or a cyclically
     adjusted balance (as a ratio to GDP) with the latter allowing for the operation of automatic stabilizers and
     countercyclical fiscal policy.

    The new rules on transfers to the budget from the National Fund establish strong bounds of fiscal discipline,
    and are expected to be anchored in a medium-term fiscal strategy that specifies the Government's intended
    expenditure, revenue and debt policies to achieve stated saving and stabilization objectives. On revenues, the
    reliance on non-oil sectors for tax revenue would be expected to expand as the economy is diversifying, though
    recent tax reform will durably reduce the tax revenue to GDP ratio. On expenditures, the implications of
    different paths of spending levels, including for continued stimulus, and composition on non-oil GDP would
    have to be considered. The size of the annual transfer should be reviewed in the context of long-run fiscal and
    debt sustainability.




74.     To enhance transparency, Kazakhstan signed on to the EITI in 2007 and is
implementing this initiative not only for oil but also for the mining sectors. The Government
is nearing the completion of the validation phase for which the following actions have been


   .
completed:

        Legislative changes were implemented in 2007 that obligated companies to sign up to the
        EITI MoU as a pre-requisite for executing contracts with the Government, comply with

   .    its requirements, and provide reports, followed by an audit report.
        Around 92% of oil and gas sector revenues and 60% of the mining sector revenues are

   .
        already part of the EITI process, and report to EITI on a voluntary basis.
        Implementation of the pre-validation EITI reporting and outreach requirements began in
        2008. Five EITI workshops and three technical seminars were held throughout
        Kazakhstan in 2008-2009 to increase public awareness. Kazakhstan received a special
        prize for its efforts to raise awareness of the EITI across the country at the 4th Global

   .    EITI Conference in Doha in February 2009.
        A draft validation report has already been assessed by the National Stakeholder Council
        and submitted to the EITI Board Validation Committee for a final review in late 2009.
        The validation process is expected to be completed this year.


                                                        - 29 -
75.      The reforms to budgetary management build on past accomplishments. Many of
these accomplishments are confirmed by the indicators highlighted in the PEFA report done in
2007-08. Kazakhstan scored high on those related to the credibility of the budget and
comprehensiveness and transparency. The treasury system is rated as one of the best in the
region, and the implementation of progressive Tax (2002) and Budget (2004) Codes were
noteworthy. Comprehensiveness of information in budget documentation; oversight of aggregate
fiscal risk from public sector entities; public access to key fiscal information; predictability in
availability of funds for expenditure commitment; effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary
expenditures; effectiveness of internal audits; annual financial statements and external audit have
scope for significant improvements, and the recently initiated reforms will address many of them.

76.      The Government has launched a second round of budgetary reforms with the
approval of a revised Budget Code in 2008. This code is being implemented over the period of
2009-201 2. The most important qualitative changes associated with the revised Budget Code
include:

    0   the delegation of authority to managers (administrators) of budgetary programs to
        reallocate resources within those programs and subprograms during the course of the
        budgetary year;
    0   a shift to approvals of three-year budgets on a rolling basis;
    0   the formal drafting of medium-term strategic plans by budgetary organizations, together
        with the integration of these plans into the budgetary process; and
    0   an enhanced emphasis on internal audits and establishment of audit units.

77.      In 2009, three-year budgeting and greater autonomy in budgetary execution were
implemented at the national level. A three-year budget was approved for the 20 10-20 12 period
based on strategic plans at the national level. Authority was delegated at the national level to
administrators of budgetary programs for the reallocation of resources across sub-programs
during the period of budgetary execution. The Government recognizes that the development of
strategic results-oriented three-year budgeting will take time to have their desired results, and
medium-term objectives will be realized as requisite institutional arrangements take hold.

78.     2010 will be an important year for the implementation of key provisions in the
Budget Code at the subnational (local) level. As the local level of Government accounts for the
40 percent of expenditures and provides the lion's share of social services to the population, the
planned changes are potentially quite important. The conditions of enhanced budgetary
autonomy for administrators of budgetary programs concerns not only regional and local
Government organs, but budgetary organizations operating in the territories such as schools and
hospitals. This is where problems in inadequate autonomy for budgetary program administrators
have been documented as being acute, and where budgetary organizations such as hospitals may
need to go through six or seven layers of bureaucracy just to get pre-approval for minor
adjustments in subprograms during the course of a budgetary year. Given the importance of these
changes in 2010, the Government has made a study of regional budgets a central element in the
JERF' with the World Bank this year. One goal of this study is to monitor in five representative
regions the implementation of the revised Budget Code, with the identification of remaining
problems.




                                               - 30 -
Addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector

79.      The Government's program in the financial sector aims to resolve troubled banks to
restore confidence and to avoid a repetition of the same situation by establishing
appropriate incentives. This has included strong financial support for the banks initially, but
has since focused on enhancing the resolution framework, restructuring troubled banks in a way
that creditors and shareholders bear a large share of its costs, and strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework for all banks. These efforts were well coordinated among the Financial
Supervision Agency (FSA), the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), and the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and sent the right signals to all parties; they proved effective so far in establishing
a degree of confidence and of stability in the banking sector, though further work to strengthen
that sector remain as part of the medium-term program.

80.     The Government, the National Bank and the FSA have made the financial sector a
major focus of attention. In the years preceding the financial crisis, Kazakhstan had the most
developed banking sector in Central Asia and the regulatory (prudential) framework received
high marks in most international studies, despite some important weaknesses that became
apparent during the crisis. Nevertheless, there were three institutional problems that led to the
crisis.

        The capacity of the Financial Supervision Agency was low, making on-site inspections
        rare and forcing authorities to rely too much on banks' own reported balances and ratios.
        In the context of a real estate boom, this created an incentive for banks to assume and
        hide excessive risks. Extensive audits following the onset of the crisis have confirmed
        this for some banks.
    0   The absence of a clear legal framework for the resolution of large problem banks gave
        large banks the impression that they were "too big to fail". Foreign creditors also took
        this into account when offering generous credit lines to large Kazakhstani banks during
        2005-2007. The rapidly accumulating National Fund reserve of the Government during
        the oil price boom also supported the expectation of a bailout.
    0   For prudential regulations, the experience of 2005-2007 convinced authorities of the
        desirability of setting tight limits on foreign borrowing and lending in foreign currency to
        debtors with insufficient foreign cash flow.
81.      In the light of these weaknesses, key steps will have to be implemented. They include
increasing the capacity for bank supervision, building a stronger bank resolution framework,
improving the monitoring of regulatory norms and indicators, increasing the authority of the FSA
to intervene in problem banks, strengthening requirements for transparency in bank operations
and ownership, and providing conditions conducive to the active restructuring of the current large
stock of non-performing loans. The Government, National Bank, and Agency for Financial
Supervision are attempting to address all of these issues both in immediate regulatory changes
and as part of a longer term Concept for the Development o the Financial Sector, which was
                                                                 f
approved on February 1, 2010 by the Government. The World Bank has cooperated with
authorities in these areas,'particularly through a series of high level brainstormings from 2007 to
2009.

82.     The FSA has stepped up its supervisory and due diligence activities. It has conducted
about 28 on-site examinations during 2009, up from 12 and 14 on-site examinations during 2007
and 2008. The supervisory resources are allocated on the basis of the size of banks, and the
supervisory cycle envisages an on-site examination for a large bank once in 12-18 months, for


                                               -31 -
medium banks once in three years and for small banks once in five years. In addition, the FSA
has placed a permanent regulatory specialist in each of the seven largest banks, and detailed
inspections have been conducted frequently. As of March 2009, these banks were also required
to draw up detailed contingency plans in the case of financial distress, subject to approval by the
FSA. Going forward, the regulators wish to move towards more risk-based supervision, more
flexible and sophisticated monitoring, while further enhancing offsite and onsite supervision
capacity. This has been an extremely important change that directly addresses a primary
weakness of pre-crisis supervision, and further strengthening supervision remains a critical
medium-term goal for the future.

83.     The Law on Financial Stabifity of October 2008 represents a key piece of legislation
for the strengthening of bank and financial sector regulation in Kazakhstan. The two most
important elements of this law concern the introduction of an elaborate Early Warning System
and enhanced means for intervening in a problem bank.

         The Early Warning System is based on a set of key indicators corresponding to the
         liquidity position, risk profile, and capital of the bank or pension fund. These indicators
         are monitored on a monthly basis. If the performance of a bank deteriorates, placing it
         on track to violate prudential norms, but has not actually violated them, the FSA is given
         the authority to take actions to begin to rectify the situation. The FSA is working to
         define these actions more specifically in order to align them to the degree of deterioration
         in the indicators. This will strengthen the effectiveness of the system while protecting
         banks from arbitrary interventions.

         The scope for external control by the FSA and Government is increased. The FSA can
         now take actions against large shareholders whose actions are perceived to possibly harm
         a bank. The Law on Financial Stability also provides conditions whereby the
         Government can purchase shares and take virtual control of a problem bank even without
         the permission of shareholders.
84.      The FSA passed a Resolution in 2008, which was significantly amended in August
2009, that activated the Early Warning System. Under this Resolution, early warning
indicators are monitored in all banks on a monthly basis. The number of enforcement measures
executed by the FSA in the form of written instructions, written warnings, and letters of
commitment increased by about one third between 2008 and 2009. The system could be
significantly enhanced by gradually increasing the regulatory actions taken by the FSA as
conditions worsen at a bank as indicated by deterioration in the various indicators. The World
Bank is currently engaged with authorities on such further improvements to the Early Warning
System.

85.      The banking resolution framework was strengthened by allowing for the creation of
(bridge) banks and purchase and assumption agreements. The framework was introduced in
a law of July 1 1, 2009 (1 85-IV). The Law provided the Government with a clear and credible
alternative for the resolution of BTA and Alliance in the event that negotiations with creditors
                                                                                     The
failed to provide a write off that would allow for their sufficient re~apitalization.~ presence
of this law has a direct effect on strengthening incentives in commercial banks for responsible
3
  Purchase and assumption allows for healthy parts of a failing banks assets and liabilities to be transferred
to a healthy bank thereby preserving key parts of the failing bank. If another healthy bank is not available,
the assets and liabilities can be transferred to a bridge bank, which is a temporary institution managed by
the authorities. The bridge bank would subsequently be merged or sold. For the medium and longer term,
this law fills a key institutional gap in the commercial bank regulatory framework.


                                                   - 32 -
risk taking, as these resolution procedures will impose high costs on the shareholders and
creditors of failed banks.

86.       A new framework for bank restructurings by a specialized financial court was also
introduced in the new bank resolution amendments. This is being used to restructure the
liabilities of BTA and Alliance Bank, while the banks remain open. The bank restructuring
process has been created, requiring a specialized court process in which creditors must agree to a
plan of repayment, which is then submitted for court approval after endorsement by the
regulatory authorities. The main purpose of this change in the law was to allow for the protection
of Kazakhstani assets from claims of creditors abroad when a bank is in restructuring
proceedings. The law has proved effective in this regard, with London courts recognizing the
validity of both the Alliance and BTA restructuring proceedings in December 2009, with any
proceedings in British courts seeking to execute claims held by foreign investors against the
Banks' assets stayed.

87.      Agreements on the debt restructuring of BTA, and an FSA-approved restructuring
plan for Alliance Bank, were major recent achievements by the Government. A primary
cause of the instability in 2007 was expectations by foreign creditors that the Government would
most likely draw upon National Fund resources to bail out larger banks. The authorities' proven
ability to restructure the liabilities of systemically important banks while maintaining financial
stability should make foreign investors feel more responsible for evaluating the risks of how the
money that they channel to Kazakhstan is used. This should promote a more efficient and
effective use of foreign credit for economic development in Kazakhstan. The restructuring of
Alliance Bank has already been agreed with creditor and approved by the FSA and the court,
whereas BTA has a non-binding memorandum agreement with the creditors' committee. Under
these agreements, the claims of foreign creditors are written down on average by 75% (Alliance)
and 60% (BTA). It is expected that the restructuring of both banks will be completed in 2010.

88.       The authorities have introduced a number of measures to discourage banks' foreign
borrowing and lending. Given that the Kazakhstan financial crisis was rooted in excessive
borrowing and lending in foreign currency, a number of recent regulatory changes have targeted
this area. In 2009, the FSA introduced a new requirement of 20 percent provisions for all loans
issued in foreign currency to unhedged borrowers. Beginning in the second half of 2010, the FSA
is also planning to tighten other prudential norms to limit the expansion of credit financed
through foreign borrowing, including a restriction that foreign loans cannot exceed 30 percent of
liabilities. Finally, the regulation of loans granted to persons incorporated in off-shore zones was
made much stricter, with provision requirements of 100 percent and asset risk-weighting of 200
percent (Le. these loans will have to be covered by capital equivalent to 34 percent of the loan).
This crisis confirmed that regulatory authorities had too little control over interactions between
banks and their offshore affiliates.

89.      The Government plans to tighten prudential norms further as the banking sector
recovers, thereby allowing time for banks to recover from the crisis. A new ratio of tier 1
capital to risk-weighted assets was introduced with a limit of 6 percent, and as of July 1,201 1, it
will be 9 percent. The Government is delaying this and some other related measures until 201 1 in
order to provide a window of opportunity for existing banks to recover from the crisis and build
their capital. In the meantime, the FSA is taking a number of measures to improve the calculation
of various norms in closer correspondence to best international practice. Notwithstanding the
measures FSA has already taken with regulations to curb risk taking, the FSA should continue to
improve regulations with regards to measurement of capital, classification of restructured loans,



                                               - 33 -
use of derivatives, accounting and auditing, and corporate governance. These issues are
addressed in the Government's approved Concept for the Development of the Financial Sector.

90.      The Concept f o r Development of the Financial Sector recognizes the importance of
improving the reputation of Kazakhstani banks through transparency and effective
corporate governance. With more limited opportunities for expanding attracted resources from
foreign sources, the expansion of the banking sector will depend critically on increasing the
domestic deposit base, which implies the necessity of improving the reputation of Kazakhstani
banks among the population. In the aftermath of the crisis, international investors will also keep a
closer eye on Kazakhstani banks. While banks will need to work primarily themselves to re-
establish and strengthen their reputations, the National Bank and FSA plan to facilitate this
process through changes in banking regulation. This includes extending regulation beyond
prudential norms to a comprehensive assessment of internal systems of risk management, making
the results of regular stress testing of individual banks public, and increasing the role of
independent members of boards of directors.

91.      The National Bank and FSA plan to adopt macro prudential supervision, and
introduce countercyclical mechanisms in the regulatory framework. Macro prudential
supervision is highlighted in the Concept for Development of the Financial Sector, and the
National Bank and FSA will collaborate to introduce these measures for addressing system wide
risks. Given the particular vulnerability of Kazakhstan and its financial sector to fluctuations in
commodity prices, the National Bank and FSA are looking toward countercyclical prudential
regulation as a useful automatic stabilizer as a medium and longer term objective. However, the
authorities already intend to change capital adequacy regulations in 2010 in a manner that
increases requirements for profitable banks.

Measures for achieving diversified and equitable growth

92.     The Government program has included policies to facilitate diversification. Many of
them aim to improve the investment climate, especially for agriculture and small and
medium-sized enterprises. These include relaxation of restrictions on private investors and
businesses, reduction in taxes on firms in non-resource sectors, and improving the enabling
environment in agriculture. Public spending on roads and rail, as well as rural infrastructure,
including drainage and irrigation, has been aimed at promoting growth in both the manufacturing
and agricultural sectors. There are also schemes for direct support through subsidized inputs, as
well for building techno- and industrial parks, not all of which have had the desired effect. In
2009-20 10, the Government announced a new "Induced Industrialization" program that has the
goal of reducing the share of resources in total exports. Public investments in education will be
important for raising productivity and competitiveness, but such investments will have to be
designed well to have the desired impact. This has to be accompanied by improvements in
targeted social protection, given the inherent volatility of the domestic and external environment.

93.     Kazakhstan improved its business environment considerably, though much remains
to be done. Today the country ranks 63rd in the 2010 World Bank's Doing Business (DB)
rankings, and the Global Competitiveness Report ranks the country 67`hout of 134 countries, both
improvements over earlier years. The key governance indicators show improvement as well.
Specifically, in the World Bank Governance indicators on "government effectiveness" and
"regulatory quality" Kazakhstan moved from 20th percentile in 2002 to 40th percentile in 2008.
The Corruption Perception Index (CPI), which measures the perceived level of public-sector
corruption ranked Kazakhstan 120th among 180 countries in 2009, an improvement from 145th
position in 2008. There is clearly scope for more improvements.


                                               - 34 -
94.     The Government has supported agriculture by improving competitiveness and
strengthening rural infrastructure. Though the enabling environment for agriculture has
improved, there is still a significant unfinished agenda. Agricultural land markets are weak,
making the allocation of land to the best possible uses in terms of growth difficult. The local
bazaars often have monopolies that charge high prices for their use. The state-owned enterprises
that provide services to farmers will have to increase their efficiency and reliability in delivery of
inputs and services. Long distances, high cost and unreliability of transport also undermine
profitability in agriculture, especially export, which is also adversely affected by poorly
functioning customs-services at the borders. The poor performance of the irrigation systems is a
major concern for agriculture in the south. The Government has tried to compensate for these
deficiencies, partly by significant subsidies for inputs and even credit for farmers, but these
subsidies are not usually well targeted and do not go where they could be most effective in raising
output. Foreign investment flows have not been attracted into agriculture notwithstanding tracts
of available land and their considerable potential. This agenda of reforms will be key for
increasing agricultural growth, which is important for non-oil growth as a whole.

95.      Human capital development is a priority for overall competitiveness and non-oil
growth.      Kazakhstan's Human Development Index, computed by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), improved from 80th in 2005 to 73rd in 2008, but is still below
many countries at comparable levels of income per capita. Kazakhstan's public expenditure on
education as a percentage of GDP increased from 3 percent in 2002 to 4 percent in 2009, but still
remains below that of economies at the same income level. The Government's major priorities
under the planned education reform include (i) providing one year of compulsory preschool
education to better prepare students, especially disadvantaged ones, for formal schooling;
(ii) improving education standards; (iii) providing equal access to education at all levels;
(iv) developing information and communication technologies to support the education system;
(v) extending school education from 1 1 years to 12 years; (vi) modernizing education
management; and (vii) rationalizing the vocational and technical education system through
partnership with the private sector to cater to the needs of SMEs.

96.      A major reform of Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) is underway. This
reform was approved by Presidential Decree 626 of July 1, 2008, and the initial phase is being
carried out from 2008 to 2012. The goal of the State Program is to modernize the TVE system so
it will provide the economy and employers with qualified specialists who possess competitive
skills and sufficient capacity for lifelong learning. This involves a restructuring of the TVE
network and a modernization of its infrastructure and technical, material, and human resource
base. The objectives of the State Program are to: (a) ensure accessibility and attractiveness of
TVE; (b) increase the quality training.and competitiveness of the workforce produced by the TVE
system; and (c) improve `efficiency' and accountability of the TVE management and funding
systems.     The State Program is being financed by 55 billion tenge (approximately
US$366.7 million) from the national budget, and calls for the following:

    0   in standards, a national qualification framework along with linkage of educational with
        occupational standards, independent assessment, and accreditation;
    0   in governance of TVE, national, regional, and institutional councils with employer and
        stakeholder representation;
    0   in finance, introduction of per capita financing will be introduced; and




                                                - 35 -
            incentives for increased public-private partnerships in TVE. In addition, the State
            Program calls for development of up-to-date teaching programs in market skills, in-
            service training of teachers and instructors, preparation of teaching materials, and
            modernization of equipment and facilities at schools and colleges.

97.      The targeted social safety net need to be strengthened and the Government has
initiated joint work to develop an agenda of action. Only half of households in the poorest
quintile receive any social assistance. The main reason for the low coverage of the poorest
households is that the better targeted program like the TSA has very low coverage. The programs
with the high coverage are based on categorical entitlements. The TSA, while the most effective
of all existing social programs at reaching the poor, would require substantial adjustments in its
targeting mechanism before it could be effectively scaled up.

98.      The social safety net in Kazakhstan are not generally well targeted. There are two
major types of categorical social transfers in Kazakhstan (social allowances and special
allowances) and three types of targeted social assistance transfers (Targeted Social Assistance
(TSA), housing assistance, and allowance for dependent children under 18.) While social
allowances and the TSA deliver the largest benefits, social allowances and special allowances
have the highest coverage, covering respectively 12 and 15 percent of the households (see
Table 9). Both social allowance and special allowance programs have their highest rates of
coverage roughly 25-30 percent in the lowest quintile, but most of its benefits go to higher
quintiles. TSA has an overall coverage of only 1 percent of the population and about 3 percent of
the lowest quintile. The distribution of benefits (the amount received by individuals in a quintile
as a proportion of the benefits received by the population) shows that the poorest quintile receives
40 percent of social allowances and special allowances transfer, the second quintile receiving 20
percent of benefits, and quintiles 3-5 receiving 12-16 percent each. The distribution of targeted
assistance, on the other hand, is focused at the low end of the wealth distribution: over 70 percent
of benefits accrue to the lowest quintile.

Consultation process

99.     Public consultation is an integral part of policy formulation in Kazakhstan. The
Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning and the Ministry of Finance are the two leading
economic agencies which coordinate consultations and discussions with stakeholders on the
policy framework within the process of preparing and formulating its three-year budget. This
process involves considerable prior consultations and discussions with key stakeholders
(including parliamentarians, local and regional authorities, think tanks, professional associations,
and private sector community) on the main parameters of the macroeconomic framework,


                                                         - 36 -
economic and social policies, and budget priorities at various stages of policy design and
formulation. The Ministry of Finance is also the key agency in the Government's multi-agency,
cross-sectoral anti-crisis committee that in the course of its activities consults on and helps
coordinate Government's responses to mitigate the impact of the global crisis. Overall, public
sector reform has been consistently communicated and discussed at various forums set by the
Government itself or jointly with the World Bank. The recent analytical report on the tax system
jointly prepared by the World Bank and the Government of Kazakhstan was broadly disseminated
and created a platform for discussion and formulation of the targeted public sector reform
 interventions.

100. The Government has led consultations on the measures supported by DPL. The
Government led by the Ministry of Finance, which is the main coordinating agency for the
preparation and the implementation of the proposed DPL, made significant efforts to ensure that
stakeholders and the public understand the proposed operation as well as the set of the reforms
and policy choices that it supports. The Minister of Finance made several public statements and
explained the rationale behind the Government's intention to borrow from the Bank.
Government's public outreach about this DPL has been regular and consistent in the past several
months and ensured public awareness and understanding of the reasons behind the proposed
operation.

101. The banking sector stabilization program has been designed with inputs from
various stakeholders. They include financial sector regulators, national association of
financiers, foreign bankers, and other donors involved in the sector. Financial sector policies
have been a focus of significant media and public attention and the Government will need to
continue to communicate proactively and consistently on the main objectives and status of the
implementation of the program.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

              A.     LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

102. The World Bank Country Partnership Strategy for Kazakhstan comprises an
innovative and flexible approach in an upper middle-income country (MIC). The
cornerstone of the CPS has been the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP) started in 2002,
which is a demand-driven AAA program co-financed by the Government. This comprises ESW
and TA, including high-level day-long brainstorming, on areas and topics identified by the
Government. It also includes investment lending projects aimed at transferring knowledge and
technical expertise in relevant areas. The CPS, presented to the Board on September 8, 2004 and
updated in early 2008, focuses on assistance and support for the implementation of the
Government's four main goals.

        Reducing losses in competitiveness through prudent management of oil revenues and
        increased public sector efficiency;
        Promoting competitiveness by strengthening the Government's capacity in reducing
        barriers to businesses and private investors;
        Building the foundation for future competitiveness by investing in human capital and
        basic infrastructure; and
        Ensuring environmentally friendly growth and mitigating ecological liabilities of the past.



                                              - 37 -
103. The DPL was not foreseen in the CPS, but the areas of public resource management
and the financial sector supported by this loan are aligned with its goals. The DPL is fully
aligned with the first and partially aligned with the next two CPS pillars. The lending program
now includes budget support operation and investment lending operations. Given that the strong
engagement of the Bank with Kazakhstan is predicated on quick and flexible responses by the
Bank to newly identified needs, our response to the authorities' request for budget support will
deepen our dialogue on reform issues.

104. The Bank's engagement with the GoK has been generally effective. Bank's
engagement has been particularly intensive in fiscal, public financial management (PFM),
financial, infrastructure, private sector development, agriculture, and social sector areas (i.e.
Health and Education). This engagement has consisted of joint analytical and technical work (co-
financed under the JEW), regular policy dialogue and investment projects. A series of high-level
brainstorms on topics that are central for Kazakhstan's long term development have been the
flagship of Bank's engagement under J E W . These brainstorms have been typically co-chaired
by the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan and the Bank's Regional Vice president and have involved
globally renowned speakers.

105.    The Bank's effective engagement before this DPL provides assurance that the
multi-year reforms will be adequately supported and continued engagement beyond it. The
Bank's program in Kazakhstan has supported development and implementation of reforms for
many years. In many cases, policy reforms have been accompanied by requests for Bank's
investment projects for supporting implementation of the recommendations (e.g. tax
administration project; customs project, etc). On the Government's multi-year reform program
on fiscal and PFM, on the National Fund and on the financial sector, the Bank has supported
technically and through policy dialogue before the DPL, and has been asked to continue beyond it
in line with the CPS. As a result of the DPL discussions and the crisis-impact, there is already
enhanced interest in Government to expand Bank's work under the J E W contingent liabilities,
poverty and migration, targeted social protection and social sector expenditure reviews in
addition to PFM, financial sector, and the National Fund. Work on the health sector expenditure
review and the regional/local budgets and budgetary management are nearing completion while
work on social protection has begun.

           B.     COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

106. Kazakhstan has a regular engagement with the Fund but there is no IMF program.
                                             V
This includes regular staff visits, Article I consultations on a 12-month cycle and technical
assistance. The last consultation was concluded in June 2009 and the IMF is planning the next
             V
2010 article I mission in late May 2010. The IMF has fielded 75 technical assistance missions
provided during 1993-2009: by FAD, LEG, MCM, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to
short-term missions, the Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan,
to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and to the Ministry of Finance.
Kazakhstan also participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000 and
FSAP updates in 2004 and 2008, all conducted by the joint IMF-WB team.

 107. The World Bank and the IMF teams work closely and maintain a regular exchange
of information. The Bank team comments on the Fund's reports and the Fund team participates
in analytical or project review meetings in relevant areas and comments on the Bank's AAA
reports and loans, including the DPL. The Bank and the IMF teams also hold discussions under
the JMAP umbrella. This collaboration is underpinned by broadly shared understanding of recent
economic developments, prospects and policy challenges. There is also a well understood


                                             - 38 -
division of labor between the two organizations as was the case with the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), update and follow-up recommendations.

108. This DPL follows a similar operation by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
approved in September 2009. The ADB Countercyclical Support Loan for Kazakhstan (KCSL)
was disbursed in a single tranche in the amount of US$SOO million in 2009 to support
countercyclical expenditure program for 2009 and, therefore, to help the GoK in mitigating the
impact of the global economic crisis and in implementing its Anti-Crisis Program and
employment generation program, supporting key sectors of the economy and generating
additional jobs.

109.      Other development partners have limited operations in the areas supported by the
DPL. The activities of two other partners, EBRD and JBIC, are mainly concentrated in the
infrastructure and energy sectors. Support of others such as EC, USAID, UNDP, ADB, and GTZ,
which complements many of Bank's activities, is summarized in Annex IX.

                C.     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

110. The current economic and political context provides a good opportunity to address
existing vulnerabilities in the economy. The last adjustment operation in Kazakhstan was
prepared in 1999. The Bank's engagement since then has focused on analytical work, technical
assistance, policy dialogue, and investment operations. The DPL builds on reforms supported by
Bank operations and is complemented by reforms and activities undertaken in a series of
investment operations, as well as substantial technical assistance, which support an overall
conducive environment for sustainable growth in Kazakhstan, including:

            Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) Modernization Project (negotiation stage)
      will assist Kazakhstan with addressing technical skills shortage through modernizing TVE
      management and governance structures and improving training quality and relevance at
      TVE institutions. The development objectives of this project are therefore consistent with
      the objectives of the Government's Road Map program.
           Health Sector Technology Transfer and Institutional Reform Project (approved in
      FY08) deals with all aspects of health sector reform including health financing, budgeting,
      planning and management; healthcare quality improvement; reform of medical education
      and medical science; health information system development; pharmaceutical policy
      reform; and food safety and WTO accession.
           South West Roads Project: Western Europe - Western China Transit Corridor
      (approved in FY09) increases transport efficiency on the road between AktobeKyzylorda
      Oblast border and Shymkent by improving road management and traffic safety in
      Kazakhstan; this increases the region's potential for development and significantly expand
      employment opportunities for the local community.
            Tax Administration Reform Project (approved in FY09) will facilitate further
      development of the Tax Administration to increase its efficiency and effectiveness with an
      overall goal to bring the tax administration system up to modern standards.
           Customs Development Project (approved in FY08) seeks to improve the Customs
      Control Committee operations through implementation of a highly-automated, low-
      discretion, risk-based system.

                                 D.     LESSONS LEARNED

1 1 1.   The key lessons from the CPS Progress Report and Country Portfolio Performance
review (CPPR) are the importance of real government ownership of operations and of quick
and flexible responses from the Bank. Many past problems rose due to slow responses by the
Bank (e.g. CPPR) and during times of changes in Government undermining ownership of
projects. The preparation of the DPL builds upon the Bank's long-standing high level policy
dialogue and engagement in the areas of economic management generally, and in various aspects
of public resource management and financial sector.

112.    The design and process for the proposed operation reflects many of the lessons learned
from the CPS implementation, asfollows:

        Ensure high level government commitment. To ensure ownership of the operation, the
        DPL is being prepared with the close involvement of the top policy makers in the
        economic team, led by the Minister of Finance. The proposed actions/reforms will
        support the Government's agenda and priorities mainly in areas where the Bank has had
        serious engagement and not in others even though some of them are important areas. The
        Bank team is helping the GoK to fine-tune their planned policy interventions and ensure
        that the reform program is coherent and has impact. There is continuing intensive
        dialogue with Government counterparts to sustain and reinforce ownership of the prior
        act ions,
    0   Focus on core policy actions. To ensure realism and credibility of the operation it
        includes only a limited number of important policy actionsheform in areas where the
        Bank has been engaged with the GoK in policy discussions and where the GoK has
        strong ownership and capacity to continue reforms beyond the DPL.
        Link operations to Government's timetable. The operation recognizes that speed and
        harmonization of the DPL schedule with the client's own timetable (linked to their
        budget cycle) will have to be combined with the quality of the operation. Because of a
        structured dialogue and completed technical work, it has been possible to follow an
        accelerated preparation timetable as requested by the Government.

1 13.   Implementation of Bank's investment operations was hindered by weak inter-
ministerial communication. The Ministry of Finance is the implementing agency for the
proposed operation. To reduce coordination problems the DPL design includes the creation of an
Inter-Ministerial Working Group which serves as a main task force from the government side and
holds the responsibility for coordination of the DPL preparation and implementation between the
agencies concerned and the World Bank.

114.    The track-record of the Bank-financed operations in Kazakhstan also highlights the
importance of putting M&E arrangements in place. The reform program sets out qualitative
and quantitative benchmarks and targets to monitor the reform progress and provides the baseline
data from which to measure outcomes by the end of the program. These indicators are embedded
in the DPL policy matrix.

                          E.     ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNING

1 1 5 . The DPL program is underpinned by analytical and technical work, high level
brainstorming and policy dialogue conducted by the Bank under the JERP. The content of
the JERP is agreed every year between Government and the Bank based on the former's


                                             -40 -
identified areas of interest. In recent years technical work and brainstorming have focused on:
(i) reform of public finances and public administration, (ii) macroeconomic management and
crisis mitigation, (iii) banking sector crisis and stability, (iv) improvement in human development
outcomes, (iv) agricultural sector, and (v) private sector development including improvement in
the business climate. Technical work and advice under the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), delivered jointly by the IMF and the Bank (most recently in March 2008) was done
outside the J E W . The above analytical and technical work and dialogue (see list in Annex X)
provided a good basis for reforms supported by the DPL, including its prior actions.

1 16. The programmatic multi-year Public Finance Management Review (ongoing since
late 2007) was important for public resource management reforms. The Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability assessment (PEFA) and the systematic sector expenditure analysis
(e.g. on agriculture, health, inter-regional and local finance) provided most of the background and
analysis for the formulation and implementation of the public resource management component.
The PEFA report identified main strengths and weaknesses in public financial management and
provided meaningful indications for further budgetary reform and has become a useful tool to
diagnose areas requiring reform in the future. Technical Assistance on the administrative reform
also supported preparation of the draft budget law.

117. A series of high-level brainstorming sessions in recent years served as a discussion
forum for advice on policy directions in key areas, including the financial sector. These
brainstorming sessions, recognized as the flagship of the J E W , have been co-chaired by the
Bank's Regional Vice President and the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, and involved globally
renowned experts on topics that are central for Kazakhstan's long term development and short
term vulnerabilities. Results from high profile analytical work and just-in time policy notes were
often presented to the Government at these brainstorming sessions. The following are some of
recent brainstorms conducted in 2008-2009.
 -   A series of discussions on Kazakhstan 's banking crisis (November 2008, February 2009,
     another one is scheduled in 2010). The WB team prepared a number of policy notes
     addressing the problems of Kazakhstan's financial sector. The first brainstorm was
     organized around discussion of the WB proposal for a Fund of Distressed Assets. The
     second one discussed the potential options for commercial bank restructuring, including the
     need for `haircuts' for foreign creditors to minimize moral hazard.
 -   A discussion on human development (February 2008). This session tackled a broad range of
     challenges facing health, education and social protection sectors in Kazakhstan.
 -   A discussion on agricultural sector potential and prospects (July 2008) highlighted
     Kazakhstan's potential (against the backdrop of the food crisis) and outlined the rich agenda
     of reform and investments. This has been an important area of Bank engagement in support
     of Kazakhstan's objective of diversification. Some of the presentations at the brainstorm
     were based on two pieces of ESW under JERP: Agriculture Sector Policy Assessment and
     the Agricultural Sector Expenditure Review.
 -   A discussion on international experiences in managing economic crises (June 2009). The
     brainstorm focused on three key concerns in managing economic crisis: the need to protect
     the population; the need to protect growth; and the need to use the crisis as an opportunity
     for change. The discussion was arranged around short-term challenges and the country's
     positioning for the next wave of growth. One of the major contributions of this brainstorm
     in the context of the proposed operation was the change in the Government's approach to
     National Fund management. The authorities recognized that economic stimulus should not



                                              -41   -
    be at the expense of long-term fiscal sustainability and that NF needs to be managed more
    prudently. The DPL is a logical follow-on instrument for supporting Government reforms of
    oil revenue management.

      V.       THE PROPOSED KAZAKHSTAN DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

                             A.      OPERATION DESCRIPTION

1 18. The proposed operation supports Kazakhstan's post-crisis recovery and the
transition to a sustainable and equitable growth path. Kazakhstan met the challenges of
economic instability and crisis quite effectively during 2007-2009, and now faces the task of
recovery as well as of more balanced and sustainable economic growth. As only moderate
growth in GDP and non-oil revenues are expected in the next few years, the Government has
placed a strong emphasis on combining continued fiscal stimulus with reforms to restore
discipline in using National Fund resources, to improve budgetary management and to strengthen
the financial sector. The Government envisages reforms and investments to promote non-
extractive tradable sectors of the economy. The more immediate priorities are to stabilize the
economy and generate some growth momentum through fiscal stimulus, better public resource
management and a more stable financial sector, which are also pre-requisites successful for
diversification.

119. The program supported by the proposed DPL focuses on improving public resource
management and addressing financial sector vulnerabilities and is thus comprised of two
pillars. Under the first, the Government is enhancing budgetary discipline through new rules for
limiting use of National Fund resources, reorienting budgetary expenditures toward (mostly
social) priorities, and implementing major budgetary reforms at the national and local level.
Under the second, the Government, the National Bank and the Financial Supervision Agency
have coordinated their actions to facilitate the restructuring of large problem banks, strengthen the
bank resolution framework, and step up significantly the framework and implementation of
banking supervision and regulation. The Bank has had a long-standing engagement in these areas
with Kazakhstan through analytical and technical work, high level brainstorming and policy
dialogue and is thus well positioned to support these reforms.

120. The Government plans to continue with reforms in these areas beyond the DPL
program period. The prior actions are shown in Box 5 . Joint multi-year technical work has
been initiated under the JEW in a number of areas including the two DPL pillars. High level
brainstorming and policy dialogue, as well as investment operations where needed, are expected
to complement the analysis and to continue supporting reforms over the medium-term.

                                         B.        POLICY AREAS

Pillar 1. Strengthening public resource management

a) Fiscal management of the country's oil wealth

12 1. Effective and disciplined management of the National Fund is critical for preserving
economic stability and defending the country's competitiveness. Prudent accumulation and
management of its resources during the oil boom provided the country with enough fiscal space
t o conduct a comprehensive countercyclical fiscal policy t o prevent recession and large scale
unemployment. While exceptional use of N F resources including financing of off-budget
expenses was helpful, the Government does not want t o continue easy and less disciplined access
t o NF a n y further, notwithstanding domestic pressures to d o so. T h e aim of the Government is t o
transform wealth currently held in oil t o financial wealth that can leave the country in better shape
and t o ensure fiscal policy that is consistent with stability and diversified growth.


                                                      - 43 -
122. The Government's key objective is to restore discipline in the use of oil revenues to
signal that it is serious, and to sustain it in a structured and transparent manner. This is
being done through rules for immediate restrictions on access to NF. A higher profile
engagement with the Bank accelerated technical work, and deeper dialogue on the use and
management of the NF. The accelerated technical work is examining best practices in
governance and management of sovereign wealth funds in other countries in order to adapt them
to Kazakhstan to see what actions can be taken in the medium-term to refine the newly-adopted
rules further. This will enhance the effectiveness of Government's efforts to maintain fiscal
discipline and implement medium term reforms to sustain it.

123.    This sub-component includes one prior action:

        limit the size of the annual guaranteed transfer from the National Fund to the budget to
        US$8 billion equivalent and obligate the National Fund to acquire only assets circulating
        on international markets.

b) Budgetary reform

124. Despite the crisis, the Government has continued its staged implementation of
reform in the budgetary sphere to make budgets more strategic and budget execution more
flexible. Lower state revenues during the crisis and its aftermath have made the Government
more aware of the critical need to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public
resources. Kazakhstan already has relatively advanced budgetary institutions in many areas, but
the absence of strategic focus and excessive rigidity in budgetary execution have plagued
budgetary management in the past. As a resource dependant country subject to considerable
volatility, medium-term budget planning is important, for countercyclical fiscal policy beyond the
crisis.

125. The Government undertook a major revision of the Budget Code in 2008 for
implementation over the following three years. In 2008, the Parliament approved its first
three-year Republican budget for 2009-201 1 on a rolling basis at the national level, based on
strategic plans of ministries. The development and adoption of three-year budgets has now been
expanded to the local (oblast) level, and Kazakhstan regions have passed these for 2010-2012.
The Code also introduces internal auditing units in ministries and other budgetary organizations,
and delegated authority to administrators of budgetary programs to reallocate resources between
subprograms during budgetary execution. The audit units were established in all budgetary
organizations at the national level by the end of 2009; those at the oblast level were close to full
completion. These actions were implemented in 2009 and 2010.

126. A key objective of the Government is to pay more attention to budgets and address
weaknesses in budgetary management identified in the PEFA report. The actions supported
by the DPL include implementation of the above three aspects of the revised Budget Code at both
national and local levels: medium term budgeting, expansion and regularization of internal
auditing and budget execution flexibility. As the local level of Government accounts for 40
percent of expenditures and provides the lion's share of social services to the population, the
planned changes are important for effective public expenditure outcomes.

127.    This sub-component has three prior actions:

    0   develop and approve three-year rolling budgets at the republican and local level based on
        three-year strategic plans;


                                               - 44 -
        delegate authority to budget administrators at the republican and local level to reallocate
        money across sub-programs during budget;
        issue regulations to establish internal audit units in budgetary organizations to conduct
        regular internal audits and establish audit units.

c) Re-orient budgetary outlays

128.      Kazakhstan has sought to reorient budgetary expenditures toward national
priorities, including greater social commitments, in the crisis period. The 2009 budget
envisaged higher social expenditures to address the negative social impact of the crisis. As
institutions to support targeted social assistance are still weak in Kazakhstan, the Government
focused immediate attention on maintaining employment through the Road Map public works
program, and through increasing public wages (25% on average), where a large share of low paid
workers are concentrated, and increasing pensions (25% on average). In this context, social
spending in 2009 reached 59 percent of consolidated budgetary expenditures, relative to 5 1-52
percent in 2007-2008, the Government has cut administrative expenditures and is phasing out
production subsidies in construction, agriculture, and SME loan refinancing, that was channeled
through SOEs, Samruk-Kazyna and Kazagro. These reallocations are being maintained in the
20 10 budget.

129. Increased social sector expenditures are appropriate amidst a crisis. Historically,
social spending in Kazakhstan has been low by comparison with other middle income countries.
In the 2010 budget, public wages for social sector workers and average pensions will be increased
by another 25 percent. The Road Map program of public works will also continue on the basis of
an additional 100 billion tenge in transfers from the Republican budget. Given limited technical
analysis the actual incidence of these increases is difficult to ascertain; however, social sector
expenditure reviews are planned this year and next which will provide a better assessment of the
targeting of these benefits. Low income public employees and citizens who receive pensions
have benefited while public works have prevented significant growth in unemployment during the
crisis; but it is not clear how many of the poor have also benefited.

130.    This sub-component has one prior action:

    0   decrease the share of non-priority administrative expenditures and capital transfers to
        SOEs in the budget and increase the share of social sector spending.

Pillar 2. Addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector

13 1. To address the banking crisis and restore domestic credit to firms the Government,
the National Bank, and the Financial Supervision Agency adopted a reform agenda. The
absence of a strong legal framework for the resolution of weak and troubled banks, insufficient
independent monitoring of banks' conditions to generate early warning signs and the perception
that the Government and supervisory agencies may be willing to bail out such banks implied an
inappropriate incentive framework for risk management by banks. Also, the regulatory
framework had gaps that could not restrain excessive external borrowing or domestic lending to
real estate sectors, and the supervision capacity needed to be strengthened. In 2009, the
Government approved an ambitious Concept for the Development of the Financial Sector that
outlined a strategy for improving the incentive framework for the financial sector, including
actions related to improving corporate governance, to be implemented over the medium term.



                                              - 45   -
132. The objective of the reform agenda, including the prior actions supported by the
proposed operation, was to change the incentive framework for commercial banks. The
immediate agenda thus focused on the three areas that needed to be addressed: (i) strengthening
the bank resolution framework; (ii) restructuring large problem banks with shareholders and
creditors sharing the cost of bank restructuring; and (iii) improving the regulatory and supervisory
framework further.

133. Strengthening the resolution framework and restructuring two large problem banks
were key for initiating recovery of the banking sector. The resolution framework would
provide the regulators with a series of options for resolving weak and troubled banks: create
stabilization banks, make purchase and assumption agreements, and the possibility of
restructurings by a specialized financial court. This fills an important institutional void in
Kazakhstan's banking regulation, and improves the Government's bargaining ability in the debt
restructuring negotiations to ensure that the costs of bailout are borne by the shareholders and the
creditors, instead of the taxpayers. This would strengthen incentives for prudent behavior. The
Government succeeded in signing memoranda with the creditors' committees for the debt
restructuring of the BTA and Alliance, under which foreign creditors write down between 60 and
75 percent of outstanding debts respectively. These restructurings are important achievements for
a number of reasons. The resolution of BTA and Alliance represents a key element for relieving
the current debt overhang, clarifying the value of claims on these banks, and re-establishing the
international reputation of Kazakhstan's financial sector.

134. A key objective of this sub-component is to signal to shareholders and creditors of
banks that they will have to bear a significant share of the costs of bank restructuring. The
agreements and their implementation achieved a significant write-down from international
creditors and alleviated the potential burden of the crisis on Kazakhstan's taxpayers, signaling
that the Government is not implicitly insuring private unsecured foreign loans.

135.    This sub-component has two prior actions:

    0   BTA and Alliance banks, each entered into a terms sheet agreement with their credit
        committees on a restructuring plan providing for their financial viability, and for writing
        down the majority of outstanding foreign debts;
    0   enacted Law to provide for strengthening the bank resolution framework, including
        through creation of stabilization banks, execution of purchase/assumption agreements and
        restructuring of banks by a specialized financial court.

136. These prior actions have enabled a supervisory response in each bank
commensurate with their weaknesses and risks. The interventions conducted so far in the
different banks reflect the depth of problems across banks. The banks' ability to receive support
from owners, and the systemic relevance of the banks. The authorities took control of the two
most troubled banks, Alliance Bank and BTA. The second and third largest banks in the country,
KKB and Halyk Bank, which presented solvency shortcomings but less than the largest two,
received mainly capital injections (of $300 million and $500 million, respectively) of a non-
controlling nature, with the Government's share being less than 25 percent of voting stock. KKB
had significant exposure to real estate sector, but has managed to sustain capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) of 15 percent while recognizing NPLs at 23.5 percent and provisioning at 108 percent of
those NPLs. The fifth and sixth largest banks were also offered participation in the capital
injection program, but they declined to participate as they favored capital support from their
foreign parents, Unicredito of Italy and Kookmin Bank of Korea. Smaller foreign banks


                                               - 46 -
including RBS, Citibank, and HSBC are mostly in the market to serve their global clients and
were less exposed to the crisis and thus likewise able to manage without Government support.
Small domestic banks are mostly considered systemically unimportant and would be liquidated
should the need arise.

137. Strengthening supervision and the capacity to intervene, especially the
implementation of the Early Warning System has also .been part of the reform agenda. The
authorities acknowledge that the limited capacity of the Financial Supervision Agency (FSA) to
monitor banks, and intervene when necessary, was a primary weakness that prevented avoiding
the financial instability that emerged in 2007. Consequently, the Government is making a strong
effort to increase capacity in this area. This includes major increases in personnel, the number of
inspections, types of inspections, and the placement of permanent FSA representatives in
systemically-important banks. The Early Warning System is a key element in the overall strategy
to increase the supervisory capacity of the FSA. Under this system, the FSA monitors closely a
set of basic indicators of the financial health of individual banks. In the event of deterioration in
performance by these indicators, the FSA has the authority to intervene in a number ways to
restrict the activities of the bank or force managerial changes, even if the bank is not yet in
explicit violation of any prudential norms. The Early Warning System was authorized by the
Law on Financial Stability of October 2008, but did not reach its current level of effectiveness
before the FSA revised its Resolution 200 in August 2009, that establishes the concrete
conditions for implementation.

138. Improving prudential regulations that can prevent excessive foreign borrowing and
credit expansion by banks is part of the reform agenda. Given that the Kazakhstan financial
crisis was rooted in excessive borrowing and lending in foreign currency, a number of recent
regulatory changes have targeted this area. An increase in capital adequacy requirements, which
is already included in existing regulations, but it is scheduled to become effective in 201 1 and
tightening of the limit of banks' foreign borrowings as a share of equity are some of the measures
adopted. Meaningful exclusions to this limit include funding from parent banks and from
international financial institutions, which are considered stable funding sources in times of stress.
This will facilitate the development of a better domestic funding base when the banks resume
substantial credit growth. Other key prudential norms are due to be tightened over the medium
term as the banking sectors recovers, including regulations that limit foreign loans to 30 percent
of liabilities.

139.    This sub-component has two prior actions:

        enacted Law to provide for establishing an Early Warning System to empower the FSA:
        (i) to monitor indicators of bank performance; (ii) to require banks to submit to a
        contingency plan in the event of a deterioration of such indicators; (iii) to take other
        additional measures as required to provide for financial stability, even in the absence of
        the explicit violation of prudential norms; and
        issued decree to: (i) introduce an increase to the capital adequacy requirements for
        commercial banks, starting in July 1, 201 1; and (ii) limit the total liabilities of
        commercial banks to non-residents relative to their equity.

140. These prior actions have strengthened the regulator's capacity to properly monitor
and control risks in banks. The early warning system and prompt remedial action framework
allow the regulator to respond quickly and early to potential bank weaknesses or breach of
prudential norms. Combined with increased monitoring of the banks and tightened prudential


                                               - 47 -
norms, it enables more effective control of risk taking by banks. Also, the restructuring with
significant costs borne by shareholders and creditors have created the right incentives for them
going forward.

141. The reforms supported by the DPL are part of a comprehensive strategy for
ensuring the recovery of the banking sector under sounder regulation and better
supervision. The Government's Strategy for the Development o the Financial Sector places the
                                                                 f
above reforms in the general context of forward-looking plans for improving the regulation of
financial markets. This includes measures to promote transparency and more effective corporate
governance in domestic banks, including extending regulation beyond prudential norms to a
comprehensive assessment of internal systems of risk management, making public the results of
regular stress testing of individual banks, and increasing the role of independent members of
boards of directors. Given the vulnerability of the country, and financial markets, to commodity
price shock, Kazakhstan is also very interested in developing effective macro-prudential
regulation in line with evolving best practices in this area. The Bank will continue to engage in
the financial sector as it has been doing in the past.

                         VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                         A.       POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

142. The set of measures that are supported by this operation are likely to have
considerable positive social impact. By improving oil wealth management discipline and public
financial management, by empowering local authorities, reorienting the budget away from
wasteful SOE expenditures, and reducing the fiscal risks in the financial sector, the Government's
Program will promote a greater availability of public resources for the vulnerable part of
population. The decentralization of service provision at the local level is also a key necessity for
improving the quality of social services. A more stable financial sector has strong advantages for
the savings of the population and the availability of funding for small scale entrepreneurs. The
operation also supports public works program targeted at temporary job creation and repair and
maintenance of public infrastructure, which has direct and immediate social benefits.

143. The measures aimed at improving the oil wealth management are expected to have a
short term impact for growth and entrepreneurship, and a longer term impact on the
creation of a major source of state income that is independent of commodity prices. The
short-term social impact on social spending from these measures is likely to be neutral, as social
expenditures will be protected in the face of lower current revenues. The impact for
entrepreneurs and prospects for diversified growth is positive, however, as the responsible
sterilization of foreign inflows in the National Fund will alleviate pressures for overheating and
loss-of-competitiveness from currency appreciation. This absorption will also lower pressures for
inflation, which usually presents disproportionately higher costs to the urban poor, many of
whom have nominal incomes not indexed to inflation. In the longer term, investment returns for
a large accumulated National Fund, which will provide a source of state revenue independent of
commodity prices, can allow for decreasing further the tax burden on entrepreneurs, and will
provide opportunities for growth and prosperity after oil reserves become exhausted.

144. The reform program for improving the public finance management is expected to
improve the relevance and the quality of basic services delivered. The program of reform that
grants autonomy to budgetary organizations operating in the territories, such as schools and
hospitals should improve the quality of service delivery significantly. Formerly, a budgetary


                                               - 48 -
organization needed to go through 6 or 7 layers of bureaucracy just to get pre-approval for minor
adjustments in subprograms during the course of a budgetary year. From 2010, budgetary
organizations will be able to shift funds between subprograms in the context of the budgetary
programs that they manage, thus allowing a more efficient allocation of resources and services in
the face of uncertainty.

145. The measures aimed at strengthening fiscal discipline, and adjusting the
composition of public expenditures away from production subsidies towards social
expenditures are likely to help the poor, but their effectiveness has to be assessed further.
This measure will not trigger direct losses of jobs as Republican budget transfers do not finance
administrative expenditure of the SOEs, including the staff remuneration. In the context of the
crisis, the Government scrutinized and cut significantly administrative expenditures on SOEs, and
at the same time increased social expenditures significantly, including raising public wages where
many of the country's lowest paid professionals are employed. Analysis of the household budget
survey shows that pensioners and employees of the public sector are overrepresented among the
poor in Kazakhstan. In the process of shifting the budget priorities, average wages and pensions
were increased by 25 percent in both 2009 and 2010. The impact of expenditure reallocation on
service delivery will be examined under the joint analytical work of the World Bank and the
Government of Kazakhstan under the review of the public financial management system and
public expenditures.

146. Bank staff simulations indicate that, while GDP contraction would have led to
poverty growth (see Table lo), the restoration and acceleration of growth in Kazakhstan
would have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction.

147. A set of measures aimed at stabilization of the labor market and its centerpiecethe
Road Map-already showed its effectiveness by keeping unemployment under 7 percent.
The Road Map comprises public works in housing and utilities, construction and maintenance of
local roads, maintenance of social infrastructure (schools and hospitals), maintenance of social
infrastructure outside of main cities (libraries, movie theaters, etc.), creation of social jobs (50%
co-financing of salaries for selected target groups), youth internships and vocational training and
retraining. Results-monitoring has received `very high priority and an Inter-Agency Commission
(IAC) headed by the Prime Minister is the nodal agency for monitoring, while Ministry of Labor
and Social Protection is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the Road Map.




                                                    - 49 -
148. At the request of the Government, the Bank will assist in monitoring by conducting
a series of surveys jointly with the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection to ascertain the
distributional impact of the Road Map. Survey techniques will include both quantitative and
qualitative methods as well as repeated observations. The issues to be covered include: What is
the relative welfare ranking of the beneficiaries of the Road map? How did the participation in the
Road Map impact their welfare? What are the characteristics of those who did not benefit, and
what prevented them from benefitting? What jobhraining opportunities offered by the Road Map
have been in excess supply and what faced excess demand? How do these differ across various
groups? What differences are discernible in impacts, between and within groups? What further
improvements in the design have been identified by the implementing agencies, social workers
and others?

149. The reform measures aimed at strengthening the financial sector are expected to
have an indirect benefit for the poor. These indirect effects are numerous. Lower fiscal costs
for the Government due to distressed banks can free up budgetary resources for social purposes.
A more stable financial sector is important for overall macroeconomic stability, which also profits
segments of the poorer population with fixed incomes that are vulnerable to inflation. Perceived
instability in the banking sector is a primary reason why many of the poor in Kazakhstan save
their money in cash dollars or EURO, and thereby receive no interest on their savings.
                            i

                            B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

150. The specific country policies supported by the DPL program and this operation are
not likely to have significant impacts on Kazakhstan's environment and natural resources.
The measures contemplated under the loan are primarily geared toward ensuring stability and
future financial system solvency, to allow a resumption of economic growth once the global
environment improves. The loan covers fiscal sector, budget and financial sector. None of the
measures envisaged under the program are expected to have significant links to the environment.

15 1, Our assessment shows that the measures supported by the operation in the area of
oil revenues are not expected to have direct impact on the amount of oil extracted and
produced. This measure relates to how the size of the annual guaranteed transfers from the oil
revenues in the National Oil Fund to the budget will be managed and how overall strong
discipline in the management of the National Fund will help to create wealth.

152. Kazakhstan has ratified the Aarhus Convention on access to information and public
participation in environmental matters. All projects financed from the budget in Kazakhstan
are subject to the standard Government procedures; requiring supportive technical documentation
(design) in accordance with national legislation, which. requires Environmental Impact
Assessments (EMS) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for all investment projects.
These are subsequently reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, or
by its regional offices.

            C.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

153. The reform program sets out qualitative and quantitative benchmarks and targets
embedded in the DPL policy matrix. Some of these indicators are produced in regular surveys
conducted by the Bank and other international organizations, while other indicators are regularly
produced by the Government.



                                              - 50 -
154. The implementation of the loan will require close coordination between the Bank
and the respective institutions responsible for the implementation of the DPL. These include
the Ministry of Public Finance, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection,
and Financial Supervision Agency, all of which will provide the requisite baseline data from
which to measure outcomes by the end of the program. The Ministry of Public Finance will assist
in the coordination of information reporting on the program's monitoring indicators. These are
being tracked, discussed and assessed among the Bank team and implementing agencies both by
staff based in the field and during the DPL missions.

155. Overall implementation, coordination and monitoring for the DPO program will be
done by the Inter-Ministerial Working Group (IMWG), which has been established to
support the preparation and implementation of the DPL. The IMWG is chaired by the First
Deputy Minister of Finance. Each sector supported by the DPL is represented by a senior official
of the relevant ministryhstitution, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy
and Budget Planning, Ministry of Social Protection, the Central Bank and the Agency for
Financial Supervision. This group meets periodically to discuss strategy and implementation
issues, and produce implementation updates which are shared with the Bank.

                                D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

156. Public financial management system and budgetary resources. The Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) prepared for Kazakhstan during the period
2007-2008 shows a mixed scenario for PFM in the country. Kazakhstan has a well developed
budgeting process that is coordinated by the Republican Budget Commission (RBC). The
country scores highly on predictability of the budget, with significant low levels of deviations of
actual spending from budgeted expenditures being recorded in the past three years. However, the
country does not score so well on overall budget comprehensiveness and transparency,
particularly with regard to comprehensiveness of information included in budget documentation
and the public access to key fiscal information. Although the budget is prepared on functional,
program and administrative classification, with economic classification being used in budget
execution reports, the budget classification is not embedded yet in the chart of accounts, and the
national accounting and reporting standards for the public sector are only in the process of
modernization.

 157. Accounting, recording and reporting. Kazakhstan has strong systems of accounting,
recording and reporting. There are well established procedures for timely and regular accounts
reconciliation, making information readily available on resources received by service delivery
units. Furthermore, comprehensive in-year budget reports are available both for internal use in
the government and external use by the public. Quality of annual financial statements, however,
remains one of the weakest points of public financial management in Kazakhstan. This is
primarily because essential information is missing from the annual financial statements, namely a
balance and financial results report. The annual financial statement consists of only one type of
report, i.e. the Annual report on the Republican budget execution which is on the other hand
timely submitted to the Accounts Committee for external audit. National accounting and
reporting standards for the public sector are not fully developed yet; and the financial reports
differ quite considerably from the IPSAS standards.

158. Public sector auditing. Public sector auditing is performed by two agencies: the
Accounts Committee (AC), the equivalent of supreme audit institution (SAI) that conducts
external audit; and the Committee of Financial Control (CFC) that performs control function (the
concept of internal audit is not elaborated in the budget legislation although the CFC is supposed


                                              -51   -
to be responsible for internal audit). However, the scope of external audits does not include the
year-end financial statements with respect to the Republican budget and of the Republican
government bodies. The government external audit system is not organized fully in line with the
international standards, and the AC does not issue any audit opinion. In fact, there is still no clear
distinction between internal audit (performed by the Committee of Financial Control) and
external audit (performed by the Accounts Committee). The Concept Paper prepared with
technical support from the Bank4 provided a basis for ultimate delineation of functions between
external and internal audit. However, following submission of the Concept Paper to the
Government in June 2009, the Government does not appear to have taken actions to implement
recommendations contained in the Concept Paper.

159. In 2007, internal audit units were created in 13 out of 38 central government
entities. The process of creating more internal audit units in the remaining agencies has slowed
down, and there has been no progress towards establishment of institutional and legal framework
for internal audit as recommended in the Concept Paper. The regulatory framework in the form
of appropriate standards and rules is in place, but the practice of these units is just beginning to
develop. Reports on control findings are issued quarterly, but are not submitted to the supreme
audit institution, i.e. the Accounts Committee, routinely. Nevertheless, the Accounts Committee
has access to reports from Internal Audit units as part of its audits and inspections, and on special
request.

160. IMF Safeguard Assessment. There has been no Safeguard Assessment by the IMF in
Kazakhstan since the country opted to fully repay the IMF loan in 1999. However, the National
Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK) has been audited regularly by reputable international
audit firms. The 2008 and 2009 audit of the consolidated financial statements was conducted by
Deloitte LLP, Kazakhstan, who issued unqualified opinion on the financial statements. Audit of
the 2007 consolidated financial statements was conducted by KPMG, Kazakhstan, and the audit
opinion was unqualified.

161. Public procurement. The latest Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) is
dated June 2000. In 2004, the Government of Kazakhstan and the Bank conducted a Joint Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review under the Joint Economic Research Program (JEkP), which
included, among other topics, a review of the efficiency of the public procurement system.'
According to the Report of Public Finance Management Assessment based on the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Framework (PEFA) dated June 2009, most major
recommendations have been given follow-up in various regulations and in the new public
procurement law. Major improvements in the recent years include: (a) separation of internal
control (internal audit) and public procurement support function; (b) strengthening of a free-
standing complaint handling mechanism, allowing bidders to appeal in a statutory order against
actions by procurement organizers, to evaluation committees if such actions are in conflict of
bidders' lawful interests; and (c) provisions for submitting financial proposals by bidders on the
day of the evaluation, separately after technical proposals assessed.

162. Public procurement reform in Kazakhstan began in 1996. The Law on State
Procurement was first enacted in June 1997 and became effective on January 1, 1998. It was
amended in December 1998. A new Law on Public Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services
was introduced on May 16, 2002. Amendments to the Public Procurement Law (PPL) were then
initiated; and a new Public Procurement Law was promulgated on July 21, 2007 (No. 303-111) and
put into force from January 1, 2008. The latest law amending the PPL is dated November 20,
2008. The main objectives of the Law on Amendments are to remove major pre-requisites for
corruption, to formally introduce e-procurement, and to improve the competitive power of local
domestic providers of works, goods and services. The amendments limited the power of
government agencies to influence the process of public procurement. As a result, the regulatory
agencies concerned will oversee the results of public procurement and will not take part in any
decision making on contract award. The amendments also excluded the national management
holdings, national holdings, national management companies, national companies and their
affiliates from application of the PPL; in other words, the procurement by such national entities is
no longer subject to the PPL; instead, the national entities should develop their own procurement
rules and procedures.

 163. The procurement system in Kazakhstan is highly decentralized, with some
centralized planning and oversight. Over the last five years the public procurement system has
gone through significant structural and administrative changes. The Public Procurement Agency
(PPA), established as an independent public procurement oversight body, was abolished in
October 2004 and its functions transferred to the then newly created Committee for Financial
Control and Public Procurement (CFCPP) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The
Government has been consistently adjusting the public procurement system to align it with the
improvements and changes in the overall market economy system. In April 2008, the CFCPP
was reorganized again and its public procurement related duties (policies and regulations) have
been transferred to the MOF's Public Procurement and Methodology Department. This
reorganization resulted in establishment of the Committee for Financial Control (CFC) which, on
top of its public procurement related control and enforcement functions, recently has been given
additional authority in the area of auditing. The Accounts Committee is also in the position to
perform external audits to ensure that public bodies comply with public procurement rules and
procedures and to ensure targeted use of budget resources, but such audits are not implemented
on a regular basis partly due to its limited capacity. Technical assistance is being provided to the
Accounts Committee through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant with a view to
build and strengthen its capacity in various areas.

164. Electronic procurement (e-Procurement) was introduced in the public procurement
system of Kazakhstan in April 2008 on a pilot basis starting with small procurement
contracts. The use of e-Procurement was expanded to large contracts in 2009. The system will
be further expanded in 2010 by using e-tenders. The e-Commerce Center administers the e-
Procurement system and provides related training. All relevant tender documents (including
forms, templates and requirements for bidders) and applicable legislation can be downloaded
from the website. The website also provides updates on results of procurement and black listings
(unreliable suppliers identified through court resolutions).

165. The June 2009 PEFA Report identified the following deficiencies in the
implementation of the PPL: excessive use of less competitive procurement methods; excessive
use of single source procurement; and, perception of non-independence of the complaint handling
system.




                                               - 53 -
166. Two years have passed since the effectiveness of the latest PPL. It is now the time to
assess the implementation and impact of the new PPL. This could be done through a
benchmarking study based on the OECDDAC "Methodology for Assessment of National
Procurement System".6 The study should be carried out jointly by the Government and the Bank.
The outcome should help the Government authorities understand the existing and forthcoming
challenges and identify actions required in dealing with them in a cost-effective manner. The
benchmarking study should also help the international donors better understand the fiduciary risks
and their mitigation for ensuring that their resources are used economically and efficiently. The
study can be funded under the J E W and carried out during the Bank's FY 201 1.

167. In addition, the Bank could provide technical assistance to help the Government
establish a comprehensive public procurement reporting and information system with
procurement efficiency indicators. Such a system should help the Government assess the
efficiency of the public procurement and make the public procurement system more transparent.

                            E.       DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

 168. The Borrower is the Republic of Kazakhstan. The loan proceeds would be made
available to the Borrower upon the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and
the Republic of Kazakhstan, represented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The loan will be on
IBRD terms.

169. Disbursement. The Borrower will submit a withdrawal application to the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Upon receipt of the withdrawal application
the IBRD will disburse the amount in single tranche into a foreign currency account that forms
part of the official foreign exchange reserve maintained in the National Bank of Kazakhstan (the
Central Bank). An amount equivalent to the loan proceeds may be credited to an account that is
available to finance budgeted expenditures. This account will be managed by and subject to the
control of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amount
deposited in the foreign currency account and confirm its availability to finance budget
expenditures, within 30 days of receiving such funds. If, after depositing funds in the foreign
currency account or the TSA, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined
in the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to refund the amount directly to the
Bank, in which case the Bank will cancel amounts refunded to the Bank.

170. The administration and accounting of the loan will be the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the loan administration
and for preparing the withdrawal application, and maintaining the withdrawal application as
required. The Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of NBK, will maintain records of all
transactions under the loan in accordance with sound accounting practices.

17 1. No additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The Bank will not require an
audit of the foreign currency account but will require the Government to provide confirmation to

  The OECD/DAC methodology is based on four pillars: (a) the legislative and regulatory framework;
(b) the institutional framework and management capacity; (c) purchasing operations and market practices;
and (d) the integrity and transparency of the public procurement system. Each pillar includes several
baseline indicators (BLls) and sub-indicators that describe formal and functional features of the system. A
score of 0 to 3 is assigned to each sub-indicator, with 0 indicating failure to meet the standard, 1 indicating
the need for substantial work, 2 indicating less-than-fill achievement with need for improvement, and 3
indicating full achievement of the standard.

                                                    - 54 -
the Bank in the form of an official letter from the Ministry of Finance confirming that the amount
of the loan has been credited to an account that is available to finance budgeted expenditures,
including date and namehumber of the account in which the amount has been deposited and that
it has been credited to an account of the government available to finance budgeted expenditures.

                           F.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

172. The proposed DPL faces program-related, global economic, political, financial
(deterioration of assets), and legal (bank debt restructuring) risks. Many of the risks are
mitigated by government ownership and Bank engagement but there are others that are not.

173. The program related risks arise mainly from the possibility of insufficient or
inappropriate follow-through on the prior actions supported by this operation, including
actions reforming the NF. This is mitigated in large measure by the high degree of government
ownership of the reform program, as evident from their implementation so far, and by the Bank?s
sustained engagement during its development. The Government and the Bank are committed to
continued analytical work and policy dialogue beyond this operation for both public resource
management and the financial sector. Nevertheless, not all risks of weak follow-through can be
fully mitigated. In respect of the NF, the new rules restricting the use of its resources for the
budget were implemented quickly to signal an end to easy access with immediate impact on
discipline, but the economic situation in the country remains uncertain, and pressures could build
for inappropriate changes in those rules. The Government is also committed to work jointly with
the Bank to continue refining the rules of the NF beyond this operation, in line with international
best practices, so as to ensure enhanced development impact. The actual implementation of the
recommendations of this joint work and its timing will depend on the economic and political
conditions in Kazakhstan.

 174. Another risk stems from the pace of global economic recovery and the behavior of
commodity prices. The prospect of Kashagan oil, which should come on stream in 2014 and
double oil output in Kazakhstan after 2020, supports confidence in the longer term financial
position of the Government, even in the event of short term volatility. Though Kazakhstan has
been hit hard by the financial crisis, the prospects for stability and growth are good. As of the
end of 2009, Kazakhstan has fiscal and gross monetary reserves of over US$45 billion and
government debt around 10 percent of GDP. Increased budgetary spending implies an increase in
the debt position of the country, but the implied trajectory is manageable. Nevertheless, a slower
pace of global recovery could weaken commodity prices and low commodity prices would open
up a current account deficit, thereby increasing vulnerability to volatility in capital flows and
complicating the difficult situation in the banking sector.

 175. Political risks are related to economic risks. As in many other countries, the economic
crisis has increased the calls for protectionism and wide-scale state interventions. The
Government stands firmly against this, emphasizing the role of the private sector and the
continued integration with the world economy in its recent Strategy until the Year 2020. The
current initiative, supported in the DPL, to strengthen discipline surrounding the management of
the National Fund is controversial. Yet support by the President indicates a low likelihood that it
will fall victim to political pressures.

176. The financial sector risk comes from vulnerability to the second-round effects of
adjustments in the real economy. Another round of increases in non-performing loans,
combined with limited access to external financing and low liquidity could raise the risk of bank
failures, a stronger recovery of growth can be helpful in this regard. Poor underwriting practices


                                              - 55 -
at banks continue to be a problem for banking supervisors, with loans based largely on collateral
with inadequate consideration being given to the financial condition of the borrowers and the
project. In addition, the weak framework for corporate insolvency undermines the ability of
creditors and debtors to develop viable alternatives to bankruptcy and liquidation, thus
encouraging banks to roll over non-performing loans rather than effectively restructure bad
assets. Both issues are being addressed through extensive technical cooperation between the
Bank and the financial regulatory and supervisory authorities, but they take time. Without
recovery of credit to firms, growth will remain subdued. The measures aimed at strengthening
prudential regulation and supervision frameworks, supported by the proposed operation will also
contribute to improving confidence and mitigating these risks.

177. There is a risk that the negotiations for the debt restructuring of BTA will be
protracted. While market expectations are very strong that a deal will be reached for BTA with
a qualified majority of creditors that broadly reflects the non-binding agreement reached with the
creditors' committee in December 2009, there are some complicated technical issues that may
take a bit more time than expected, particularly concerning the proper identification and treatment
of trade credits. Despite very high market expectations of a deal this calendar year, there is a risk
that the resolution of these issues could take longer.

178. The content of program helps to mitigate risks. The design of the overall WB
Economic Program in Kazakhstan helps to mitigate operational risks. The policy actions
supported by the proposed DPL are all significant for mitigating economic and political risks
described above. This includes especially measures aimed at establishing strong fiscal discipline,
the program for alleviating the immediate impact of the economic crisis on the population and
support growth, and reforming the regulation of the financial sector in a manner that will promote
greater stability.

         Republic of Kazakhstan-Assessment Letter for the International Bank for
                             Reconstruction and Development
                                      April 16,2010

This note provides the IMF staffs assessment of Kazakhstan's macroeconomic developments and
prospects, for the purpose of the Development Policy Loan (U.S. $1 billion) to be considered by
the Board of Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The
assessment is based on information available to staff as of early April. The next Article IV
consultation mission is scheduled for late May 20 10.

Recent Developments and Outlook

The government responded to the sequence of shocks that hit the economy in 2007-09 with
generally sound policies. By using accumulated savings from the National Fund, the authorities
mobilized large-scale assistance in support of the financial sector and the real economy through
an anti-crisis plan amounting to around 7.5 percent of 2008 GDP. The stimulus was crucial in
stabilizing banks and in lessening the impact of the crisis on growth and employment. Also
crucial was the government's strategy of supporting the confidence of domestic depositors, and
therefore avoiding significant runs on deposits, while conducting difficult external debt
restructuring processes of two large banks.

Notwithstanding the government's support, most macroeconomic indicators deteriorated in
2009. Real GDP growth slowed sharply to 1 `/4 percent (from 9 percent in 2007). Exports declined
significantly and the external current account shifted into deficit. Aggregate credit contracted,
despite monetary easing, mainly reflecting a decline in demand and heightened risk aversion by
banks. Private sector external debt is high at 98 percent of GDP, but banking sector debt has
declined to 26 percent of GDP (from 44 percent in 2007). Inflation has remained relatively
contained, at 7% percent at end-March 2010.

At present, the main source of vulnerability is the ongoing difficulty in the banking sector.
The authorities have taken a number of steps to stabilize the banking system, including direct
capital injections into four large banks, resulting in majority shareholding positions. Nonetheless,
the sector remains stressed, with negative capital (reflecting the unfinished debt restructuring
process), high credit risk exposure, a drastic fall in profitability, and a sharp increase in non-
performing loans. Banks will likely continue to face deteriorating asset quality in the months
ahead, which may erode the provisioning buffers, and add to the difficulties associated with
limited external funding and high liability dollarization.

In the near term, staff projects a slow economic recovery-still constrained by banking
sector difficulties, but aided by stronger trade and continued policy stimuli. Staff projects
real GDP growth of around 2% percent in 2010, increasing gradually toward its projected
potential. The external current account is expected to become positive again in 2010, driven by a
strong rebound in exports (in particular oil) combined with a relatively slow recovery in import
growth. This would allow for some build up of gross international reserves and could see the
recent trend of appreciation in the tenge continue, contributing to a recovery of confidence in the
currency. Staff projects inflation to be contained at around the current level this year, which is
significantly lower than in 2005-08.

Policy Priorities

There is a need to forcefully address the underlying vulnerabilities in the banking system.
Although the expected modest appreciation of the tenge should help limit currency induced credit
risk, bank balance sheets remain exposed, and until the key sources of vulnerability are
addressed, lending activity will remain subdued. Key to a sustainable recovery is the effective
mobilization of domestic savings to replace foreign credit and government support through a
clearer and more comprehensive solution to difficulties in the sector. This should involve a
transparent strategy for loan recovery and bank recapitalization, and this could possibly involve
further public sector support. In addition, priority should be given to strengthening Financial
Supervision Agency regulation and supervision, including by paying greater attention to the need
for effective corporate governance.

With large international reserves and low public debt, any withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus
should be gradual. In this regard, the authorities? budgetary framework seems appropriate. This
framework needs to be accompanied by strong medium-term institutional arrangements to assess
the macroeconomic impact of fiscal policies at the aggregate public sector level, and to define the
appropriate use and savings of oil revenues and improve the quality of spending.

Monetary policy will have to find the balance between keeping inflation under control and
supporting the financial sector and real economy. Although inflationary pressures appear
contained for now, real interest rates should be kept positive to support depositor confidence.
Once the banking sector difficulties have been resolved, the economy would benefit from greater
exchange rate flexibility within the recently introduced wider band. This would support domestic
financial market depth and enhance the transmission of monetary policy.

In the longer term, Kazakhstan is set to benefit from its mineral resource wealth and
foreign asset holdings, Nonetheless, success in promoting sustainable development will entail
reduced dependence on commodities and increasing reliance on private consumption and
investment as the primary sources of growth.

Fund Relations

Staffs engagement with Kazakhstan centers on surveillance and technical assistance
activities. The 2009 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 8, 2009, and the staff report
was published in October 2009 (IMF Country Report No. 09/300). Recent technical assistance
includes bank stress testing and financial market development.

   ANNEX V: KAZAKHSTAN: BANKING SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND RISKS

The bank sector is described in three sections: (A) overview of the banking sector
developments and risks (B) summary of authorities' actions in response to the crisis, and
(C) summary of the restructuring of BTA and Alliance Bank.

                A. Overview of the Banking Sector Developments and Risks

Pre-crisis banking sector developments

1.      The Kazakh banking sector is dominated by domestic banks. The banking system is
comprised of 38 banks at end-2009 and it is primarily domestically-owned. At end-2009,
foreign banks owned about 17 percent of banking system's assets.

2.      The banking system is somewhat concentrated.                The top five banks
(Kazkommertsbank, BTA, Halyk, Bank Centercredit, and ATFBank) account for 74 percent of
total banking sector assets and the top two banks (Kazkommertsbank and BTA) account for 38
percent of assets.

3.       During 2004-mid 2007, Kazakhstan experienced high credit growth, a t the expense
of a build-up of risks to financial stability and implicit contingent fiscal risks. Annual
domestic credit growth rates averaged 67 percent between 2004 and July 2007, fuelled by foreign
capital inflows into the financial sector. During 2005-2007, the nominal value of credit to the
economy almost doubled on an annual basis. The inflows were motivated partly by the plentiful
global liquidity, partly by the country's resource richness and thus expected ability to generate
foreign income, and partly by a widespread perception that the financially sound Government
would back the financial sector should weaknesses arise. As a share of GDP, credit to the private
sector increased from 26 percent in 2004 to 59 percent in 2007, and stood at about 50 percent at
end-2008. The growth in credit outpaced the growth in deposits. As a percentage of GDP,
deposits increased from 19.4 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2007, and stood at 28 percent at
end-2008.

4.      The expansion in credit was fuelled mainly by external funding sources (Eurobonds
and loans), resulting in high loan-to-deposit ratios and exposing the banking sector to
liquidity risks. The Kazakh banking sector relied heavily on external funding sources, mainly on
wholesale financing, resulting in the loan-to-deposit ratio increasing from 136 percent in 2004 to

                                              - 74 -
over 220 percent by mid-2007, i.e. outstanding loans reached 1.2 times the value of bank
deposits. The external debt position of the Kazakhstani banking sector escalated from US$8 to 46
billion (42 percent of GDP) during 2005-2007. Banks' funding by foreign investors grew to as
much as 40 percent of the banking sector's total assets, exposing the sector to liquidity risk
should capital flows reverse. At end-2008, when the credit boom ended, the share of foreign
wholesale borrowings in the banking sector reached about 50 percent of total liabilities. This
liquidity risk was exacerbated by the fact that in contrast to most other countries in the region
with large foreign capital inflows, the Kazakh banking system was predominantly domestically-
owned and therefore more susceptible to lose access to capital market funding.

5.       Much of banks' lending was directed to the construction and real estate sector and
to households. From 2004 to 2007, corporate lending increased on average by 58 percent, while
retail lending increased by 106 percent. As a result, household indebtedness stood at 16 percent
of GDP in 2006 and at 22 percent of GDP in 2007. The share of real estate lending doubled
between 2004 and 2007, amounting to 30 percent of GDP at end-2007. At end-2007, real estate
loans comprised 37 percent of total loans. Consumer loans comprised 12 percent of total loans,
loans to individuals for house construction comprised 10 percent of total loans, and mortgage
loans comprised 7 percent of total loans. Loans to the construction sector increased rapidly by
over 100 percent from 2006 to 2007, and comprised on average 25 percent of total loans during
the period 2006-2008.

6.     About half of the loans were in foreign currency, much of it to unhedged borrowers,
and the credit portfolio was therefore negatively affected by the devaluation of the currency
in February 2009. The exporting sectors are mostly in the energy and mining sectors, which are
funded directly from abroad.

7.       The banking sector entered the crisis with adequate prudential ratios, but much
vulnerability emerged. At end-2007, the capital adequacy ratio stood at 14.2 percent, banks
were profitable, with a return on equity (ROE) of 18.4 percent and a return on assets (ROA) of
2.3 percent, and liquid (with the ratio of liquid assets to total assets at about 18.4 percent). NPLs
were quite low, and still looked modest by end-2008 at 5.2 percent, despite a difficult liquidity
situation since August 2007, which curbed lending growth. Kazakhstan was also better placed
than other emerging economies to weather the crisis due to its large foreign currency assets and
low public debt.

Impact of the financial crisis

8.      The Kazakh banking sector faced the first external shock in August 2007, with a
sudden stop in capital inflows sparking a banking crisis and threatening financial stability.
In August 2007, Kazakh banks started to face difficulties in raising external financing due to a
sudden stop in capital inflows. The net outflow of foreign capital from Kazakhstan's banks
amounted to US$13.8 billion during the period July 2007-June 2008. The impact of the sudden
stop in capital inflows was cushioned by the increase in oil prices in the first half of 2008.
However, in the second half of 2008, with oil and commodity prices falling sharply, the economy
was hit hard. The loss of foreign funding triggered a liquidity crisis in the banking sector, as well
as a speculative run on deposits and the national currency. At end-September 2007, about 9
percent of local currency deposits were withdrawn compared to the previous quarter, while
foreign currency deposits increased by more than 28 percent.

                             Figure 5. Deposits (YO
                                                  growth per quarter)

9.       The authorities successfully stabilized the liquidity situation by defending the
currency and providing liquidity to the banks. The package included a strong commitment to
defend the exchange rate of 120 tenge to the US dollar, together with the provision of sufficient
liquidity to prevent a collapse of the banking system. This basic recipe proved effective for
stabilizing expectations in late 2007 and most of 2008. Its effectiveness received a major boost
from record oil and commodity prices, which generated a sizeable current account surplus to
compensate for the deterioration in the capital account. During this time, the Government also
channelled additional funding to the ailing construction sector, particularly for the completion of
frozen construction projects with positive perceived present value that were financed partly by
pre-payments of future residents. Finally, to support depositor confidence, authorities raised
deposit insurance seven-fold from 700 thousand tenge to 5 million tenge (from
US$5,833 to US$41,667).

 10.    The stop in capital inflows caused a severe credit crunch, as banks faced significant
liquidity constraints. Kazakhstani banks also lost virtually all access to rollover opportunities in
the global financial markets. This created significant liquidity pressure on the banks, which had
relied extensively on capital market funding, and they responded by attempting to shrink the
credit portfolio and increase domestic deposit collection. Starting in mid-2007, lending to the
economy stalled and grew very slightly over the next 36 months, with y-on-y growth rates in total
lending by end of December 2008 and December 2009, of 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent,
respectively. By March 2009, foreign currency loans increased by 27 percent and local currency
loans decreased by 6 percent compared to the previous quarter due to the devaluation of the tenge
in February 2009. At end-January 2010, credit grew by 3 percent y-0-y (with local currency

deposits decreasing by 3 percent and foreign currency deposits increasing by 10 percent) and it
declined by 0.5 percent from end-2009.

11.      As the financial crisis deepened and the economy fell into recession in late 2008,
authorities took a proactive stance and helped the banking sector repay foreign obligations,
recapitalized the four largest banks, and intervened in BTA and Alliance Bank. Authorities
supported the banking sector with liquidity and capital injections, avoiding a systemic collapse
and excessive contraction in credit to the private sector. The National Bank provided liquidity
and the country's holding company for state enterprises, Samruk-Kazyna, committed to capital
injections in the four largest banks in the system and provided deposits. In February 2009, the
authorities intervened in two of the largest banks (BTA and Alliance Bank) whose deteriorating
financial condition prevented them from paying their debt. The deposits of a number of state-
owned organizations were also shifted from the National Bank to commercial banks.

12.      The interventions were successful at maintaining financial stability and largely
stabilizing levels of credit to the private sector. Credit to the private sector has remained
almost flat since the interventions, and CDS spreads have come down to 550-800 bps for the two
largest banks (now Halyk Bank and KKB) from more than 3,000 in the summer of 2009. The
interventions were successful in maintaining depositor confidence in the rest of the system,
although depositors did leave BTA and Alliance after the intervention.

 13.    Liquidity injections continued after the nationalization, most notably as facilitated
by a bond swap between Samruk-Kazyna and the two intervened banks, which further
increased fiscal risks. Samruk-Kazyna received bonds in BTA and Alliance in exchange for its
own bonds, which the banks in turn could pledge to the National Bank for liquidity. The bonds
that Samruk-Kazyna received in the two banks will now be converted into equity according to the
current restructuring plan. Thus, the fiscal costs will remain uncertain until a post-restructuring
market value of the bank can be established, and an estimate has not yet been made.

14.     Financial stability was maintained despite the February devaluation and the
defaults by BTA and Alliance, without triggering a collapse in confidence in the rest of the
financial system and a major run on deposits. At end-December 2009, deposits had increased
by 66.4 percent over the last 2 years, driven by the large increase in corporate deposits by 86.4
percent (with individual deposits increasing by 32.1 percent). The growth in corporate deposits


                                                      - 78 -
occurred primarily as a result of an increase in the deposits of public institutions in the banking
system. Foreign currency deposits have also increased from 35 percent of the deposit base at
end-2008 to about 44 percent by end-2009, due to a loss of confidence in the tenge.

15.      Despite not having access to international capital markets, short term liquidity has
recovered in many banks. The liquidity situation is uneven in the banks with the largest bank
being much less liquid than the rest of the banking sector. Banks have managed repayment on
their foreign obligations by curbing new lending and relying on support from authorities. Some
banks have begun building up liquidity held with the central bank, reflecting a need to be able to
respond to renewed depositor uncertainty, disruption to payments in case of problems with
individual banks, and to maintain the ability to manage their foreign currency position should the
currency come under renewed pressure.

16.      The medium term funding situation is uneven across banks, and difficulties for
banks in refinancing their liabilities are likely to depress credit generation for the medium
term. Analysts have suggested as much as 50 percent of the current domestic funding is either
from the Government, Government affiliated entities, or state-owned enterprises, and this source
is unlikely to grow. Most of these funds are short-term and demand deposits. Thus, there is a
refinancing risk if these companies face liquidity shortages themselves and have to withdraw
deposits. Renewed access to global markets is likely to be restricted to the most creditworthy

on foreign obligations and credit growth.

17.     Asset quality has deteriorated rapidly resulting from exposure to the failing real
estate/construction sector, the weakening economic environment, and increased leverage of
borrowers resulting from the depreciation of the currency. The official share of NPLs for the
whole banking system at end-January 2010 stood at 35.7 percent with most of it concentrated in

the insolvent banks, with the rest of the system excluding BTA, Alliance, and Temirbank having
NPLs of 16.6 percent of their loan portfolio. The share of loans that were overdue more than 90
days reached an estimated 2 1.9 percent of the loan portfolio at end-January 20 10, although much
of this is concentrated in BTA and Alliance, the two largest banks that are being restructured.
Non-performing loans are concentrated in the construction and real estate sector where banks
have real estate as collateral.

18.      In response to rising NPLs, banks have increased provisioning. Provisioning relative
to total loans increased from about 6 percent in 2007, to 11 percent in 2008, to 38 percent in
2009, and stood at 37.0 percent as of end-January 2010, mainly due to high provisions in BTA,
Alliance, and Temirbank. Provisions as a share of NPLs have also decreased from 136.6 percent
at end-2008, to 103.3 percent at end-2009 (at 109.7 percent excluding BTA and Alliance), and
stood at 103.7 percent at end-January 2010 (at 114.9 percent excluding BTA, Alliance, and
Temirbank). This indicates that provisions more than cover the non-performing loans.
Kazakhstani banks other than the large BTA and Alliance also suffered considerably from the
crisis, but with economic recovery and some resilience to new NPLs, the prospects for avoiding
further major defaults or debt restructuring look increasingly promising.

19.     The rise in provisioning has severely impacted solvency. Kazakhstan's banking
system became insolvent in aggregate after problems in BTA and Alliance were accounted for in
May 2009, Asset problems were not revealed in the regulatory data of BTA and Alliance until
special audits in the spring of 2009. Between January and July 2009, BTA lost 1,682 billion
tenge (US$11.2 billion) in capital and Alliance Bank lost 682 billion tenge (US$4.5 b i l l i ~ n ) ~
rendering both banks deeply insolvent. As of end-2009, BTA had -1,737 billion tenge in capital
and Alliance had -448 billion tenge in capital. The capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector
declined from 14.9 percent at end-2008 to -8.2 percent at end-2009, and stood at -8 percent at
end-January 2010. Excluding the failed BTA and Alliance, at end-2009, capital adequacy was
16.7 percent, at end-January 2010, it was 18.5 percent (excluding BTA, Alliance, and
Tem irbank).

20.     Given developments described above, the banking sector continues to face
significant risks going forward, arising from:

               Continued deterioration of asset quality for non-intervened banks. NPLs stood
               at 16 percent at end-January 20 10 (excluding BTA, Alliance, and Temirbank).
               However, the actual number of NPLs may be higher. The authorities' failure to
               identify and disclose asset quality problems in BTA and Alliance Bank renders
               uncertainty over true asset quality in the rest of the system. The special audits
               commissioned by creditors in BTA and Alliance in the spring of 2009 revealed
               large hidden losses, and a similar audit has not been carried out in other banks. As
               the asset quality problems became evident in 2008, banks restructured the
               repayment terms of many loans, which are now classified as performing loans, and
               the true asset quality of such loans may not yet be clear.

               Liquidity risk, mainly due to refinancing the maturing foreign borrowings and
               dependence on short term deposits from state entities. With the onset of the
               global financial crisis, Kazakh banks were exposed to a very high level of
               refinancing risk given the high share of their funding accounted for by foreign
               borrowings. In the second quarter of 2009, foreign debt was the largest source of
               financing for banks, accounting for 45.6% of the sector's total debt (although it had
               fallen from 54.8% during the third quarter of 2007). Foreign liabilities of the
               largest banks have been partly refinanced with local resources - mainly short term
               deposits of the government and government-owned entities. Domestic total
               corporate deposits increased from 22.9% of total bank funding in Q3 2007 to
               31.7% in mid-2009, of which almost 60% it has been estimated was from
               government-controlled bodies.* With this support from the authorities, banks were
               able to service their foreign debt in 2009. Among the top five banks, KKB is by far

                    repaying US$750 million during the fourth quarter of 2009 but it doesn't have any
                    other large repayments due in 20 10.

                    Failure to successfully restructure BTA. Despite significant shrinking of the
                    bank since it was intervened, BTA remains a large bank whose failure would have
                    systemic implications.

                B. Summary of Authorities' Actions in Response to the Crisis
21.      Authorities have used a variety of measures to maintain financial stability while
curbing fiscal risk. The measures include liquidity support, solvency support, nationalizations, a
framework for restructuring banks, enhancement of the legal framework for resolving troubled
banks, introduction of an early response mechanism, introduction of a system of on-site dedicated
supervision, enhancement of off-site monitoring and on-site examinations of banks, increase in
the minimum capital requirements of banks, modifications in prudential requirements particularly
those relating to external borrowing and lending to entities with parents in select off-shore
centers, and institution of special funds to refinance loans to select sectors. The authorities are
also contemplating adoption of a macro prudential and counter-cyclical regulatory framework.
Key measures are discussed below.

22.      Liquidity support was provided through several channels including the central
bank, through Samruk-Kazyna deposits under credit support schemes, through state-
owned enterprises shifting deposits from the central bank to the commercial banks, and as
facilitated by Samruk-Kazyna through bond swaps that allowed BTA and Alliance to
receive. The National Bank reduced the minimum reserve requirements from 2% to 1.5% on
domestic liabilities of banks and from 3% to 2.5% on foreign and other liabilities of banks,
considerably increased the reverse REP0 transactions in the market, lowered the official
refinancing rate 6 times from 10% to 7% and lowered rates on its notes from 6.5% to 2.5% by the
end of the third quarter of 2009. Samruk-Kazyna supported liquidity through its credit support
schemes, which allowed the banks to partially refinance their existing portfolio and were used to
roll over existing loans. SMEs were supported by a US$1 billion loan refinancing under which
banks received a deposit in return for extending credits, and US$l.3 billion was lend to banks in a
program for refinancing certain mortgages. Finally, depositor confidence was underpinned by
increased household deposit insurance from 700,000 tenge to 5 million tenge (US$4,700 and
US$33,300, respectively) in an effort to support depositor confidence in the banking sector.

23.     Solvency was supported by providing U S 2 . 2 billion in capital support twinned with
programs to underpin asset prices. Of the US$2.2 billion, US$1.4 billion was used to take over
BTA through a forced issue of shares. Programs to underpin the real estate market were
undertaken with US$2 billion purchases of real estate in Almaty and Astana, which helped
support the most important asset class banks were exposed to.

24.     A number of regulatory measures were taken by the FSA. Although such measures
are more effective during the growth period in which risks are accumulating, they do change the
incentive framework reducing the risk of a similar crisis in the future. The measures are
summarized in Box 1.




                                               - 84 -
        Box 1. Prudential Measures undertaken by the FSA in the period Q4 2008 - 4 3 2009
Increasing minimum amount of banks' equity. In order to strengthen the banking sector's potential and
increase its competitiveness, the requirements to a minimum amount of equity of existing and newly
established banks was increased from October 1, 2009 to 5 billion tenge, and from July I , 201 1 - to 10
billion tenge. The new minimum amount of equity for regional banks where a major amount of services is
provided in the regions of Kazakhstan except for the cities of Almaty and Astana, amounts to 2 billion
tenge from October 1, 2009 (subject to compliance with certain conditions); and from July 1, 201 1 it will
amount to 4 billion tenge.
Changing the framework for the regulatory capital calculations. From January 1,2010, preferred stock
of banks previously included in the calculation of the Tier 2 capital will be included in the calculation of
the Tier 1 capital. This measure is of a countercyclical nature since its introduction would result in the
increased values of calculated capital adequacy ratios of banks. In addition, with the view of improving the
quality of regulatory capital, from July 1, 201 1 perpetual financial instruments will be excluded from the
calculation of the Tier 1 capital and will be used in the calculation of the Tier 2 capital.
Changing the capital adequacy ratios. Under the Standards of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision a new capital adequacy ratio was introduced - KI-2 (ratio of Tier 1 capital to the sum of risk-
weighted assets and liabilities):
         for a bank in which a bank holding company or a parent bank has a participation interest, which
         have a certain rating assigned by one of the rating agencies, the capital adequacy ratio KI-2 should
         be at least 0.05, and from July 1 , 201 1 - at least 0.08;
         for a bank without a large participant - an individual KI-2 should be at least 0.07, and from July 1,
         20 1 1 this ratio should be at least 0. IO;
         for other banks and those banks in which over 50% of distributed shares are owned by the
         Government, the capital adequacy ratio KI-2 should be at least 0.06, and from July I , 201 1 this
         ratio should be at least 0.09.
Besides, FSA introduced a number of measures aimed at reducing leverage calculated as a ratio of first-tier
capital to total assets, including contingent liabilities (kl-1), which will be implemented in two stages: k l -
1 >> 0.08 starting July 1,2012 and k l - l > > 0.09 staring July 1, 2013.
Changing the ratios that limit the level of liabilities to non-residents. To enhance the financial
sustainability of the banking sector, the maximum value of k8 and ~9 ratios (liabilities to non-residents to
equity) were decreased to 2 (from a range of 2-2.5) and 3 (from a range of 4-5) respectively, effective
July 1, 2009. In addition, to take account of the specifics in the operations of banks with foreign
participation, subordinated debt to a non-resident parent bank and liabilities of a bank subsidiary in the
Republic of Kazakhstan to a non-resident parent bank on received loans were excluded from the calculation
of ~8 and ~9 ratios.
From October 1, 2009, as part of the calculation of bank capitalization to liabilities to non-residents ratios
~ 7 ~8 and ~ 9non-invested balances accepted by a bank under a custodial agreement were excluded from
     ,           ,
the amount of liabilities to non-residents of the Republic of Kazakhstan. From the same date, unsecured
guarantees and sureties of a bank started to be included in liabilities to non-residents when calculating the
bank capitalization ratios ~8 and ~9 for the purposes of limiting foreign borrowings though bank affiliates.
Changing the liquidity ratios. To enhance the financial sustainability of the country's banking sector and
protect bank depositors, a current liquidity ratio k4 (average monthly highly liquid assets of a bank to
average monthly demand liabilities) was introduced, the regulatory value of which is equal to 0.3.
From October 1, 2009 unsecured guarantees and sureties of a bank issued when bank subsidiaries, legal
entities affiliated to the bank raise foreign borrowings and also as part of bank securitizations with the
creditor's right to demand early repayment of liabilities, were included in the algorithm for calculating the
current liquidity ratio k-4 as part of demand liabilities. The majority of banks were well above the
established ratios; therefore this didn't have a material impact on the bank liquidity.
Tightening the provisioning requirements in respect of certain types of loans. For the purposes of
credit risk regulation, requirements were tightened in relation to provisioning against loans provided in



                                                     - 85 -
foreign currency to those borrowers which do not have appropriate foreign exchange proceeds andor
whose foreign exchange risks are not covered by the relevant hedging instruments on behalf of a borrower.
Besides, from January 1, 2010, the classification category of a loan (including loans approved before
January 1 , 2010) provided to a borrower (debtor, co-borrower) that is an entity registered in the off-shore
zone or is an associate or subsidiary of the entity registered in the offshore zone, will be initially defined as
"loss" (provisioning at 100%).
In addition, the ``loss'' category definition for loans to off-shore affiliated borrowers was revised in
November 2009. According to the revised definition it includes loans to (i) a borrower or co-borrower of
whose equity at least 50 percent is contributed by the off-shore entityhndividual; (ii) a borrower or co-
borrower whose decisions are approved by the off-shore entityhndividual according to the contract. This
requirement for loans issued before January 1, 2010 that meet these criteria becomes effective starting
April 1,2010.


Revising the factors which are used by the FSA to identify the reduced sustainability level of Banks:
         critical values of reduced capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios were revised;
         the definition of "non-performing loans" was specified ("non-performing loans" were replaced by
         "loans where delinquency on the principal andor interest is 90 days or more");
         when identifying risks associated with lending to the construction sector, only those loans that
         were provided for the purchase and construction of commercial and residential real estate and
         residential mortgage loans have been taken into account.

                    C. Summary of Restructuring of BTA and Alliance Bank

25.     In February 2009, the authorities intervened in BTA and Alliance Bank, and
creditors subsequently exercised repayment acceleration options in response to the change
in control, and compounded by the balance sheet problems surfacing in the ensuing months,
authorities were forced to change tactics. At the time of intervention the authorities' strategy
was for the banks to remain current on repayment obligations and contest creditors' claim for
early repayment under change-of-ownership covenants. As two large creditors prevailed in
exercising the covenants and successfully accelerated repayment on their claims, the intervened
banks were forced to stop debt repayments.

26.     Authorities needed better tools to handle two of the largest four banks failing and
introduced a bank restructuring framework and a revised bank resolution framework
including purchase and assumption provisions and a bridge bank option. The restructuring
framework allows the banks to restructure their liabilities while continuing to operate, and the
new resolution tools enhance the authorities' ability to handle an unsuccessful restructuring
through a resolution of the two banks. The revised resolution framework is useful not only
should it be used, but it also improved the government's negotiation position vis-a-vis the banks'
creditors by providing a credible alternative to liquidation, which could have had dramatic
systemic implications.

27.    The Kazakh bank restructuring law is similar to corporate insolvency regimes in the
US and UK and provides debtor protection while in bankruptcy. The New Restructuring
Law was published in the official gazette on July 30, 2009, took effect on August 30, 2009, and
BTA and Alliance Bank officially entered restructuring under the law on October 16, 2009 and
September 18,2009, respectively. The framework is summarized in Box 2.

                                    Box 2. The New Restructuring Law

The bank restructuring process has been created, requiring a specialized court process in which creditors
must agree to a plan of repayment which is then submitted for court approval after approval by the
regulatory authorities. This process represents a new way to deal with a systemically important,
internationally active troubled bank by involving the creditors in the restructuring process under the
supervision of a specialized court and the approval of any restructuring plan by the supervising agency.
The main purpose of this change in the law was to provide a framework for the purpose of protecting
Kazakhstan assets from claims of creditors abroad when a bank is in restructuring proceedings and also
provide a bank needing to be restructured with the possibility of emerging from the proceedings as a
profitable bank. The law is based on the British banking law and Chapter 15 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code which are designed to deal with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and
other parties in interest involving more than one country. The law has proven effective in this regard with
London courts recognizing the validity of both the Alliance and BTA restructuring proceedings in
December, 2009, thereby staying any proceedings in British courts seeking to execute against the Banks'
assets. The restructuring amendments have had a positive impact on the banking sector by keeping two
systemically important banks in the system, preparing them for ultimate sale and insuring that claims of all
creditors in those banks will be partially met. In past bank liquidations creditors beyond the third priority
received no return at all while it is anticipated that all recognized creditors in the BTA and Alliance
proceedings will receive at least some payment for their claims.

The restructuring process can be summarized in the following steps:

    1.   Application for restructuring filed with the specialized financial court - application must include
         agreement between the financial organization and the supervising agency as well as a draft
         restructuring plan.
    2 . Court must review application for restructuring within 5 days after filing.
    3. Court must render decision on restructuring indicating period of restructuring; decision is
       delivered to the financial organization and the supervising agency.
    4.   Within the time established by the court to conduct restructuring the bank shall convene a meeting
         of creditors. Approval of the restructuring plan shall require consent of creditors which account
         for at least 2/3 of the bank's total liabilities which are to be restructured (deposit liabilities are not
         subject to restructuring).
    5.   Once the creditors approve the restructuring plan the plan shall be submitted to the court for
         approval. Performance of the actions proposed in the restructuring plan leads to discharge of the
         liabilities which were the subject of court or arbitration decisions pending against the financial
         institution.
    6 . Bank shall deliver the approved restructuring plan to the supervisory agency.                   Terms of
         restructuring plan can be revised if required by supervisory agency.
    7.   After approval by agency, bank shall submit plan to the court for approval. Restructuring plan
         must contain specified information including anticipated financial results of restructuring.
    8. Specialized financial court approves the final restructuring plan and decision of the court takes
         effect when made and is immediately carried out.

28.      The restructuring of the two banks has proceeded at different speeds and with some
delay in the more complicated case of BTA. Alliance Bank reportedly has a smaller number of
creditors who are more amenable to finding a solution, whereas BTA has a larger and more
diverse group of creditors. As a more systemically important bank, the Government is in a
weaker negotiating position, because creditors understand that a liquidation of BTA would be
painful for Kazakhstan. The table below summarizes progress in the restructuring of the two
banks.

*Revised on March 17, 201 0.

29.       The most critical and difficult step is to reach agreement between the bank and
creditors. The first step for both banks has been agreement between the bank and a steering
committee representing the different classes of creditors, which Alliance achieved in October
2009, and BTA achieved in December 2009. On March 27,201 0, BTA signed a revised principal
commercial terms sheet with the Steering Committee that is slightly more favorable for the
creditors than the non-binding Decembkr agreement. However, the new term sheet is also non-
binding and must be agreed by a qualified majority of creditors representing two thirds of
liabilities under restructuring during BTA's creditor meetings scheduled for March 3 1,201 0.

30.      The new purchase and assumption provisions under the amended Kazakh
resolution framework facilitate good banMbad bank reorganizations and are supported by
the introduction of a stabilization bank similar to the US bridge bank, which can be the
holder of the good assets of a failing bank. This option allows the regulatory agency to transfer
certain assets and liabilities of a bank in conservatorship to a stabilization bank created by the
bank regulator. The regulator is the sole shareholder of the bank until the sale to an investor or
liquidation of the stabilization bank upon transfer of its assets and liabilities to another bank. In
order to address the rights of depositors and creditors under Kazakhstan law to object to the
transfer of their accounts and obligations, the law sets forth a short objection period after notice
of the creation of the stabilization bank is given. FSA resolution number 179 provides the
framework for the stabilization bank.

                ANNEX VII: KAZAKH GOVERNMENT'S ROAD MAP PROGRAM
                                (public works program)


1.       The regional employment strategy under the Road Map Program was designed to
support job creation through the additional financing of projects in: housing and utilities;
construction and maintenance of local roads; maintenance of social infrastructure (schools and
hospitals); maintenance of social infrastructure outside of main cities (libraries, movie theaters,
etc.); creation of social jobs (50% co-financing of salaries for selected target groups); youth
internships and vocational training and retraining.

2.      The strategy was implemented in stages. During the first stage, the total amount of
available funds for each region was determined on the basis on an assessment of regional risk
level, which corresponds to an "Employment Map" and assessed probabilities of layoffs. The
Employment Map was put together by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, and contained
detailed region-specific information about the possible number of job terminations and the
specializations, qualifications, and education levels of workers at risk.

3.      In 2009, the Road Map allocated 186 billion tenge in co-financing contributions
from the republican and regional budgets, and employed an estimated 247,822 individuals.
In addition, 70,668 workers received training under the program, with 41,131 (60%) finding
employment after receiving this training. The Road Map also gives special attention to
employment opportunities for workers laid off following the completion of public projects. As
estimated 16 1,123 workers lost employment in this manner, but permanent employment was
found for 55,689, new temporary "social jobs" for 73,430, and training or internships for 5 1,186
people. Some of this training will be for projects slated for 2010. Thirty six percent of Road
Map funds were allocated to projects in utilities infrastructure, twenty nine percent was spent on
the renovation of 2,478 hospitals, schools, and other social infrastructure, and work on local roads
accounted for 30 percent (more than 70 kilometers of new roads, capital repairs on 2800
kilometers).

4.      Results-monitoring of the Road Map program has received very high priority. The
Road Map program is coordinated and monitored by an Inter-Agency Commission (IAC) headed
by the Prime Minister. The Commission includes representatives of Parliament, various
associations, and the mass media. The functions of the IAC include: (i) determining employment
risk levels on a regional basis, (ii) setting regional finance limits, (iii) developing appropriate
performance indicators for evaluation (iv) weekly monitoring of implementation (iv) approval of
reports submitted from the local level, and (v) reviewing monthly reports on implementation with
participation of the mass media. Parallel commissions have been set up at the regional level
under the leadership of the regional akims (governors). The Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the Road Map. A website has been
created, http://dorkarta.enbek.gov,kd,that provides detailed information on specific projects,
administers, and oblasts, including financing, jobs created, and number of people trained.

            ANNEX VIII: GOOD PRACTICE IN PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM

(i)    The wage rate for participants is the most crucial variable as it will determine (a) how
many people want to join the program; and (b) who applies.
         Program evaluations from around the globe have shown that the poverty and employment
effects are largest if the wage rate is set at a level which is no higher than the prevailing market
wage for unskilled manual labor - in countries with high informality, the unskilled wage rate in
the informal sector is often used as the reference measure. The higher the wage rate compared to
the wage of unskilled labor in the informal sector, the higher the demand for the program and the
more difficult rationing (deciding who can enter) is. Schemes that have paid significantly above
such rates have had difficulties reaching the vulnerable groups and have instead led to
displacement effects in the labor market.
(ii)    Another key determinant of success is that the work requirement is enforced.
        Programs that have failed to enforce the work requirement (e.g. Argentina's Jefes
program) have seen that beneficiary numbers did not automatically drop to the extent possible in
times of economic recovery.
(iii)  Restricting the duration of benefits stresses the temporary nature of the public works
programfor beneficiaries.
        Given that the program ishhould be of temporary nature for participants until they find
another job (or can be supported through skill building, etc.), fixing a participation timeframe
(which could be renewable) is an important instrument for project management.
(iv)     The labor intensity (share of wage bill in total cost ofpublic works projects) should be as
high as possible. However, no public works activity o some quality can be done with labor alone
                                                        f
- materials are needed so as to ensure that the projects completed are of good quality.

         Public works programs, especially if implemented at a decentralized level, often contain
standardized guidelines for local governments (e.g. municipalities) to develop and propose
projects for public works. These guidelines (e.g. the unit cost of a job created) are important to
evaluate both the labor intensity as well as the quality of the proposed local projects. The
infrastructure that is created through the program best serve the vulnerable population itself - this
is key for sustainability at the local level (e.g. rural or small roads, maintenance or labor-intensive
rehabilitation of social infrastructure, etc.). Successful programs require local governments to
plan for proper maintenance of the created infrastructure from the start.
(v)     Setting up a good monitoring and accountability system f i o m the start is key to success of
the program.
         This can include establishing (and publishing) transparent criteria for participation which
are applied uniformly at the local level; installing mechanisms for complaint and oversight;
delineating appraisal and monitoring criteria for local sub-projects; assigning non-governmental
organizations roles in providing feedback, monitoring services and consultation at the local and
central level.
(vi)      While often started in situations of severe economic downturns, public work programs
can - with an easing of the situation on the labor market - also be used to provide important
skills to participants that increase their j o b market chances later on (link to vocational training;
apprenticeships for the youth.)
