KARNATAKA TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A tank is a small reservoir behind an earthen embankment.  Tanks
have been the traditional source of irrigation water in the areas of low and
erratic rainfall in southern India (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu
and Karnataka) for many centuries. They are built to store seasonal runoff
from streams and minor rivers mainly during the months of the Southwest
Monsoon. Water is released either during the rainy season itself to protect
the standing crop or, if remaining supply permits, to raise a second irrigated
crop in the following months of scant or non-existing rainfall. Priority is
given to supplementary kharif irrigation (protective function), but farmers
usually try to minimize water use for this purpose in order to make a second
crop possible. The distribution of water is through one or two main canals
and then through primitive field channels to the crops.
1.02      A tank command area may range in size anywhere between a few hectares
and several thousand hectares. In the past, smaller tanks were usually built
by village communities and local landlords, larger ones by regional princes.
After Independence, State governments took over ownership of all existing
tanks with more than 4 ha command area (about 25,000 in Karnataka), construc-
tion of new tanks, and their operation and maintenance. However, since
the thirties increasing emphasis has been given to large scale surface irri-
gation schemes, starting with the Krishnarajasagar Scheme near Mysore, fol-
lowed after Independence by several others--most notably the Tungabhadra
Scheme commanding about 418,000 ha (within Karnataka). While construction of
large schemes continues, e.g., in the IDA-assisted Upper Krishna Scheme, the
Government of Karnataka (GOK) has realized the limitations of large projects,
which provide irrigation only to certain areas of the State while leaving
other dry and drought prone areas without irrigation development. The merits
of minor irrigation (tanks, lift schemes, pick-up weirs, wells) once again
became recognized, for it allows greater geographical flexibility and provides
water to many areas poorly endowed with water resources.
1.03      As part of the current Five Year Plan (1980/81 to 1984/85), GOK
has scheduled a Minor Irrigation Program of about US$126 M, of which US$108 M
will be used for construction of tanks and lift irrigation schemes and for
repair of existing schemes. Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA's
assistance to finance a four year time slice (1981/82-1984/85) of GOK's tank
construction program, covering 120-160 new tank irrigation projects (TIPs)
spread throughout the State of Karnataka. 1/ This would be the first time
that IDA would assist directly in the development of minor surface water
schemes in India. (Minor irrigation has been receiving support by IDA
through agricultural credit operations.)
1/   A tentative list of TIPs has been prepared by GOK, including 160
individual projects.



-2-
1.04      Tanks to be financed under the proposed project would be located
mostly in drought prone areas and where large scale irrigation development is
not feasible. They have short gestation periods and thus would yield quick
returns. The proposed investment would promote a regionally more balanced
development and reduce rural poverty and unemployment. The tanks would also
provide opportunities to experiment with more modern irrigation practices, for
crop diversification and the setting up of water management organizations at
the grass root level. Lessons learned from the tank project could be used in
the design and subsequent management of major irrigation projects where small
management units (irrigation blocks) could be disaggregated from the large
conveyance system and be operated somewhat like individual tank projects. 1/
Agriculture and Irrigation in India
1.05      India has a population of about 660 M which is growing at an annual
rate of 1.9%. Although since 1960 per capita income grew at an annual rate
of 1.4% and reached US$180 in 1979/80, and although access to public services
has improved, there has been little change in the incomes of the vast masses
of urban and rural poor, who comprise about 50% of the total population.
Therefore, GOI's development plans give priority to alleviating poverty and
creating employment, especially in rural areas.
1.06      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and contri-
butes about 45% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and provides
the base for about 55% of India's exports. During the last decade, GOI devel-
opment plans have emphasized agriculture and sought to raise food production
by increasing the use of fertilizers, plant protection chemicals and improved
seed varieties. In suport of this, GOI has modernized and expanded its agri-
cultural credit institutions and accelerated the development of irrigation.
1.07      Some 50 M ha are presentlv irrigated, about three-fifths from
surface water sources and two-fifths from groundwater. Irrigated areas are
almost four times as productive as rainfed areas and account for about 60%
of agricultural output. The expansion of irrigation facilities and the
productivity gains on irrigated lands have accounted for at least three-
quarters of the agricultural growth since 1960.
1.08      Actual utilization in many completed irrigation projects remains
low. In an attempt to remedy the situation, Command Area Development programs--
focusing on development below the Government outlet, i.e., on the construction
of field channels and drains and on landshaping---have been initiated in most
major irrigation projects. Experience from such programs indicates, however,
that a lack of on-farm development is only a partial explanation for the
1/   Instead of the traditional irrigation outlets in the major projects
(which serve areas of about 40 ha) a proposal under consideration (not
part of this project) is to build small tanks near these outlets where
water can be stored overnight or possibly longer and supplied to the
consumers below the tank on a more flexible basis than the traditional
rotational system.

underutilization of the irrigation potential. It has become increasingly
clear that one of the major constraints to greater utilization lies in the
deficiencies of the distribution system between the water source (dam or
diversion) and the Government outlet.
1.09      Project design, water allocation and canal operation procedures have
changed little since the last century when the prime objective of irrigation
was to provide "insurance" against drought and famine. Existing designs and
management procedures make it almost impossible to provide a timely and
reliable water supply at the farmgate--a prerequisite for modern agriculture
based on high yielding, high value crops. Furthermore, actual water conveyance
losses are much higher than assumed for the design of the canal systems,
which reduces the area that can actually be irrigated. As a consequence,
on-farm development is resisted by the farmers who have to pay for its cost
and may not see the benefits. Improvements of both irrigation structures and
on-farm development should be complementary and reinforce each other to meet
the demand of modern agriculture. These objectives have been pursued by many
recently Bank-financed irrigation projects in India.
The State of Karnataka
1.10      General.  The State of Karnataka has an area of 19.1 M ha and a
population of about 35.5 M (1979). Population growth during the last two
decades is estimated at about 2.2% per annum. About 70% of the labor force
is employed in agriculture. The ability of urban centers to accommodate
migrants from rural areas is limited and the welfare of the majority of the
State's population is critically dependent on growth in agriculture.
1.11      The Economy.  Between 1960/61 and 1978/79, State income grew at an
annual rate of 3.5%, slightly higher than the national average. Sectoral
growth in Karnataka differed from that of the rest of India as follows:
Share in              Trend Growth
Net Domestic Product      1960/61  1978/79
Karnataka    India       Karnataka  India
(average 1974-79, %)        (% per annum)
Agricultural & Allied
Activities                 48          40           2.9       2.2
Mining, Manufacturing,
Construction, etc.         23          25           4.4      4.3
Services                       29         35           4.1       4.5
Total                   100         100           3.5      3.3
Karnataka's agriculture grew faster than agriculture in the rest of the
country, yet it showed the lowest growth among all sectors in Karnataka.
Since it is the main activity in the State and has close links to transport,
storage, trade and other services, the comparatively poor performance of the
service sector can partly be explained by the slow growth of agricultural

output. The fastest growing sector has been manufacturing. However, with
its small and highly concentrated base, it contributed only marginally to
the welfare of the majority of population in the rural areas (75%).
1.12      Per capita income grew at 1.3% p.a., close to the national
average. In 1977/78, average per capita income was estimated at about
Rs 1,130 (US$135). Variations in the regional income levels are largely
a result of ecological factors:
Average

/a   The State is divided into ten agro-climatic zones,
based on soils and rainfall patterns (see para 2.06).
In this table they have been further aggregated into
four groups, based primarily on the amount and relia-
bility of rainfall.
/b   Value-added in the agricultural sector per head of
rural population.
The table indicates that the high rainfall areas have a higher agricultural
output per head of rural population and higher average per capita income. The
removal of regional inequities depends largely on the increase of agricultural
output. Since unpredictable and low rainfall tends to restrict growth in
agriculture, an expansion of reliable irrigation facilities would reduce this
constraint, particularly in the dry and transitional zones.
1.13      Employment.  The labor force constitutes about 35% of Karnataka's
population. The participation rate is higher in rural (36%) than in urban
areas (27%). In 1971, cultivators accounted for 40% and agricultural laborers
for 27% of the workforce. Productive employment has failed to keep pace with
population growth. Open unemployment in 1977/78 was 9.3% of the rural and
11.4% of urban labor force (9.8% of total labor force). 1/ No estimates of
underemployment are available, although it is considered more significant.
Removal of unemployment and underemployment is one of the main development
objectives at present. Highest priority is accorded to irrigation, agricul-
ture and allied activities which generate high employment. In addition, in

March 1979, GOK introduced the "Employment Affirmation Scheme" which aims
at providing work of about 100 days in a year to all able-bodied adults who
cannot find work during the slack agricultural season.
1.14      Rural Incomes.  Average rural per capita income in Karnataka
is estimated at about Rs 750 (US$89) per year. 1/ About 70% of the rural
population is considered as living at or below the poverty threshold. 2/
Because of sluggish growth in per capita rural income, the incidence of
poverty has basically remained unchanged. GOK has attempted to implement a
series of programs to raise standards of living of the poor, including land
reform, minimum wages, assistance to small and marginal farmers, subsidies to
artisans, special programs for scheduled Castes and Tribes and other backward
minorities. Experience indicates that the Employment Guarantee Scheme in
Maharashtra had a significant effect on incomes of a large group of landless
laborers and small farmers. The Employment Affirmation Scheme in Karnataka
is expected to have similar effects.
Land Reform, Land Tenure and Farm Sizes
1.15      Land Reform has been in effect since 1965.  It provides land owner-
ship to tenants, fixes land ceilings, and redistributes surplus land among the
landless. Land ceilings are fixed as 20 ha for rainfed and 8 ha for irrigated
land per family of five, but are increased for each family member in excess of
five, up to double the basic ceiling. So far, about 0.22 M tenants have been
declared owners of about 0.44 M ha land. In addition, 0.13 M ha have been
declared surplus to be distributed to landless farmers. At present, about
90% of all holdings are wholly owned and self operated; 5% are partly owned,
partly rented and the remainder 5% are wholly rented.
1.16      The average farm size in Karnataka decreased from 3.20 ha in 1970/71
to 2.98 ha in 1976/77, due to a reduction in both the number and the area of
large holdings. Marginal and small farmers continue to be predominant. The
change in holdings of various categories of farms occurred as follows:
% of Numbers      % of Operational
Category of Farms          of Holdings             Area           Average Size (ha)

1.17      Regional variations in farm size distribution are determined by
agroclimatic conditions; small farms are much more frequent in high rainfall
areas than in low rainfall areas:

However, small farms in high rainfall areas support considerably more people
than similar size farms in other areas.
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN KARNATAKA
General
2.01      Agriculture contributes about 45-50% of Karnataka's State income
and employs about 70% of its labor force. From 1955/56 to 1977/78, production
of most major crops increased at a moderate rate.
Topography and Climate
2.02      The State forms the southwestern part of the Deccan Peninsula.  Most
of the State is on a plateau, bordered in the west by a coastal strip and the
Western Ghats (up to 1,500 m in altitude) and tapering off in altitude from the
Ghats towards the east. All rivers originate in the Ghats, flowing west or
east. The State includes four distinct physiographic zones (see Maps IBRD
15341 and 15343):
(a) The coastal plain between the Western Ghats and the Arabian
Sea. It averages about 30 km in width, and has an annual
rainfall ranging from 3,000 to 3,700 mm, virtually all of
it during the Southwest Monsoon.
(b) The Western Ghats, a mountain range averaging 50 km in
width and extending for 650 km from the North to South.
It includes the areas with the highest rainfall in the
State, ranging from 1,000 to 6,400 mm and averaging
about 2,500 mm.
(c) The Northern Plateau, lying to the East of the Ghats, with
mean annual rainfall varying from 900 mm at the western
margin to 500 mm at the eastern. However, rainfall increases
again towards the Northeast to about 900 mm. Elevation
averages about 600 m.



- 7 -
(d) The Southern Plateau is similar to the Northern, but with
more rolling topography and annual rainfall in the range
of 750 mm to 500 mm.
2.03      Karnataka has a tropical monsoon climate.  It receives the major
portion of its rainfall from the Southwest monsoon which usually starts
in early June and continues with some intervals till the end of September.
The Northeast monsoon commences in October and usually ceases by the end of
December. There are considerable variations in both amount and distribution
of monsoon rainfall. The times of onset and end of the monsoon are uncertain
and long dry spells frequently occur within the rainy season. In fact, as
many as 135 out of 175 taluks 1/ in the State are often exposed to drought
(classified as "drought prone"). These conditions make irrigation important
for successful crop production even during the monsoon season.
Soils
2.04      A wide variety of soils occurs in different parts of the State (Map
IBRD 15342). Deep black soils are mostly confined to the northern parts of
Karnataka. They are over 90 cm deep and usually dark brown in color, silty
clay and clay, ranging from 40-65%. They have high water holding capacities.
These soils have low permeability (0.1-10 mm per hour) and a tendency to
swell and shrink as the soil moisture fluctuates. They are fertile and pro-
duce good yields when moisture is adequate. Medium deep black soils occur
mostly in the north central part of the State. These soils are moderately
deep (30-90 cm) and dark in color. They contain a high percentage of clay
(30-40%), have a moderate water holding capacity, ranging from 30-40%, and
are moderately permeable with an infiltration capacity of 0.5-2.5 cm per hour.
Shallow black soils occur mainly in the northern parts of the State. These
soils are less than 30 cm deep, gravelly clay loam to clay loam and clay in
texture with low water holding capacity of 20-35%. They are moderately to
highly permeable with moderately high infiltration. The soils are well
drained. Red loamy soils are found in a long strip east of the Western Ghats.
The soils are sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam to clay loam, with low fertility
and shallow rooting depth and low water holding capacity, ranging from 20-25%.
They are well drained with moderate permeability. The infiltration capacity
ranges from 1.5-2.5 cm per hour. Red sandy soils occur in the southern and
central part of the State. They are 50-80 cm deep with a high proportion of
quartz gravel. The surface is a thin layer of gravelly to cobly sandy loam
to loamy sand; the sub-soils are gravelly to strong sandy clay with gravel
ranging from 30-50%. These soils also have low fertility and shallow rooting
depth. The soils are moderately rapid in permeability with an 2-3 cm per hour
infiltration rate. Adequate doses of organic manures to build up soil struc-
ture, fertility and water holding capacity is necessary to obtain satisfactory
crop yields in these soils. Laterite soils mainly occur on gently undulating
rolling plains, in hilly topography, and along the coastal high rainfall
areas. They are deep, dark red in color, and clay loam to gravelly sandy loan
on the surface and clay loam to gravelly sandy clay or clay in the subsurface

horizon. They are acidic and low in water holding capacity (about 20-30%)
with moderately high permeability and infiltration. Alluvial soils occur on
the coastal plains. They are deposited soils consisting of washed-down
material from the Western Ghats. The soils are loamy sandy to sandy loam on
the surface, with loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam to clay loam in the sub-
surface horizon. They have low water holding capacities, with moderately slow
permeability. The water table in the low-lying areas is usually at 1 to 1.5
meters for most parts of the years.
Land Use
2.05      About 11.9 M ha (62% of the State's area of 19.1 M ha) is under
cultivation. The forest area is 2.9 M ha (15%), less than what is required
to maintain a healthy ecological balance. About 1.9 M ha (10%) are either
barren, uncultivable or put to non-agricultural uses. Cultivable waste
land accounts for 0.6 M ha (3%). The remaining 1.8 M ha (10%) are used
as permanent pastures or as grazing land. In practice there is little
scope for increasing the cultivable area.
Agro-Climatic Zones
2.06      Karnataka has been divided into ten agro-climatic zones based on
climate, topography, soils and vegetation (see Map IBRD 15341). These
zones are:
(a) The Northeastern Transition Zone (5%) 1/ receives between
800-900 mm of rainfall annually. The soils are black clay
with poor drainage. Main crops grown are sorghum, maize,
cotton and chillies in the wet season; pulses, maize, and
oilseeds in the dry season.
(b)  The Northeastern Dry Zone (13%) receives from 600 to 800 mm
of rainfall. The highest rainfall occurs in September and
October. The soils are deep black clay in most areas.
Sorghum, millet, oilseeds, pulses and cotton are the main
crops grown.
(c) The Northern Dry Zone (34%) has a semi-arid monsoon climate.
Rainfall varies widely over the large area, being somewhat
higher in the western and northern parts. Much of the zone
receives less than 600 mm of rainfall per year. Two types
of soils, black clay and red sandy loam, exist in the area.
The principal crops are sorghum, millet, pulses and oil-
seeds.
(d) The Central Dry Zone (10%) also has a semi-arid monsoon
climate and receives between 400-700 mm of annual rainfall,
mostly during the pre-monsoon (April to May) and monsoon

(July to October) seasons. The soils are red sandy loams
with some mixes of deep black clays. The important crops
are sorghum, millet, pulses, chillies, oilseeds and some
cotton.
(e) The Eastern Dry Zone (8%) also receives pre-monsoon and mon-
soon rains which range between 800-900 mm annually. The
soils are mostly red sandy loam with some clay laterites.
The main crops are millet, paddy, pulses, maize and oil-
seeds. As a cash crop, mulberry is extensively grown
throughout the year.
(f) The Southern Dry Zone (7%) has natural features similar to
the Eastern Dry Zone, except that pockets of black clay soils
are intermixed with red sandy loam in some areas. The prin-
cipal crops grown are paddy, sorghum, millet, pulses and
oilseeds. Sugarcane and mulberry are important cash crops
in this zone.
(g) The Southern Transition Zone (7%) forms a narrow strip wedged
between the dry zones (Southern and Central) and the southern
part of the Hilly zone. Annual rainfall varies widely from
place to place and ranges between 600-1,000 mm. Red sandy
loams and loamy soils dominate in the area. The main crops
are paddy, sorghum, millet, pulses and sugarcane.
(h) The Northern Transition Zone (8%), between the Northern Dry
Zone to the east and the Hilly Zone to the west, forms a
strip extended from the Southern Transition Zone, where
annual rainfall ranges between 600 to 1,300 mm. The soils
are black clay and red sandy loam in equal proportion.
The principal crops are paddy, sorghum, pulses, oilseeds,
cotton and sugarcane.
(i) The Hilly Zone (6%) occupies a long narrow mountainous area
to the east of and parallel to the coastal belt. Rainfall
is very heavy and reliable. The soils are red clay loams and
laterites in major areas. The main crops are paddy, condi-
ments, spices and plantation crops such as coffee.
(j) The Coastal Zone (2%), a long narrow coastal belt lying
between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, receives a
high and assured rainfall during the monsoon season. Paddy
is the main crop and coconut, arecanut, cashews, fruits
and other perennials are extensively grown.
Crops and Cropping Patterns
2.07      Karnataka has three cropping seasons:  Kharif (usually June-October);
Rabi (November-February); and hot weather (February-May). Most of the crop-
ping takes place during the kharif season, utilizing the monsoon rainfall.



- 10 -
In the northeastern and northern dry zones where over 50% of annual rainfall
occurs between September and December, the main growing season is later than
in other parts of the State. Rabi crops are grown on residual soil moisture,
occasional rainfall or with irrigation. No cultivation is practiced during
the hot season, except in areas where perennial irrigation is available.
The variable agro-climatic conditions in the State have caused a diversity of
cropping patterns. Major crops are described below:
2.08      Paddy is the most important cereal crop of the State, accounting for
about 10% of the total cropped area. Almost 65% of the crop is irrigated, and
paddy is the preferred crop for irrigated land, taking up about 35% of the
gross irrigated area. Rainfed paddy is mostly grown in areas of assured rain-
fall, i.e., the coast, the hills and in the transitional zones. The average
yield in the State is estimated at about 3.2 t/ha; rainfed yields average about
1.8 t/ha. 50 to 60% of paddy consists of high yielding varieties (HYV), with
yields of 4.0 to 4.5 t/ha under average irrigated conditions, and about
2.0 to 2.5 t/ha when rainfed. Highest yields are achieved in the hot season
(February to April) under irrigation. HYVs are usually transplanted. Local
varieties, mostly drilled and grown under rainfed conditions, give average
yields varying with rainfall from 1.0 t/ha to 2.0 t/ha.
2.09      Sorghum is the major dryland crop in the State, grown rainfed during
the monsoon season and on residual soil moisture in the dry season. Sorghum
is the staple food crop especially in the northern dry zones and occupies
about 21% of the cropped area. Several hybrid varieties are gradually replac-
ing local varieties. Average yields are low at 0.6 t/ha for local varieties
and 2.0 t/ha for the hybrids. Hybrids under irrigation can be expected to
produce about 3.0-3.5 t/ha.
2.10      Millets are an important crop group in the low rainfall areas of the
State, accounting for about 20% of the cropped area. They are mainly grown in
the kharif season and to a small extent under irrigation in the rabi season.
Ragi or fingermillet 1/ is the staple food crop in the southern parts of the
State. About 90% of it consists of HYV. Hybrid bajra or pearl millet 2/ and
minor millets occupy the remaining area. The area under minor millets is
gradually decreasing as the hybrids and HYVs are more widely adopted by the
farmers. Crop yields are low at 0.4 t/ha for local varieties, and 0.6 t/ha
for HYV, both under rainfed condition. When irrigated, HYV ragi and hybrid
bajra average yields are about 1.6 t and 2.4 t per ha, respectively.
2.11      Maize has been a minor crop in the past.  However, since the intro-
duction of hybrid seeds in the early 1970s, the area planted to maize has
rapidly increased. Still the total cropped area in maize is only about 1%.
Further growth in maize production is expected from its increased acceptance
as a foodgrain, as livestock feed and for industrial processing. Hybrids
occupy about 90% of the maize area and are grown under irrigation. In the
Southern and Northern Dry Zones, hybrid maize is also being successfully grown
as a rainfed crop. Average yield of hybrid maize in the State is about 2.9
t/ha as against a national average of about 1.0 t/ha (all varieties).

- 11 -
2.12      Wheat is a popular rabi crop cultivated in the northern parts of
the State. It accounts for 3% of the cropped area in the State. About 40%
of the cropped area is covered with HYVs of the semi-dwarf Mexican types and
local improved varieties. The present yield of HYV wheat is low at 0.8 t/ha
as against the average of about 1.3 t/ha in India. Locally improved rainfed
varieties give about 0.5 t/ha. These low yields are attributed to the
southern location and high winter temperatures.
2.13      Pulses account for about 13% of the cropped area in the State.
Pulses comprise cow pea, pigeon pea, bengalgram, blackgram, greengram, and
horsegram. They are grown in all seasons, virtually all under rainfed
conditions. Pigeon pea is the most important pulse in the kharif and bengal-
gram in the rabi season. Yield of pulses under rainfed is about 0.4 t/ha
and irrigated about 0.5 t/ha. GOK is encouraging farmers to grow more pulses
as a cheap source of protein supply. Higher yielding varieties have recently
been introduced for some species.
2.14      Oilseed crops are groundnut, safflower, sunflower, sesamum, linseed,
niger and coconut. They account for about 9% of the total cropped area in the
State. The most widely grown oilseed crop is groundnut. Presently, most
oilseeds are grown rainfed during kharif, but farmers start growing them also
during the rabi season. The average yield of unshelled groundnut (the most
important oilseed) is low at 0.5 t/ha rainfed and about 0.8 t/ha under irriga-
tion. GOK encourages expansion of oilseeds in line with a national policy.
2.15      Cotton is an important fiber crop, grown on 9% of the cropped area,
primarily on the black soils in the northern parts of the State. Karnataka
contributes about 10% of the total cotton production of the country. Pre-
sently, long staple hybrid and HYV cottons are grown mainly on irrigated areas
(about 7% of the cotton area). Most of the rainfed varieties are Asiatic and
American upland cottons. They have usually short to medium staple length.
A poor average yield of about 0.3 t/ha for rainfed cottons is attributed to:
(a) the use of mixed seed of low viability; (b) poor pest control; (c) the
vagaries of rainfall, particularly the timing of early rains; and (d) the
unwillingness of farmers to invest in inputs under those conditions. Since
1972, two hybrid varieties have been successfully introduced in Karnataka.
They are especially suited for the area and for irrigation, and are of the
long staple type. Yields under average irrigated conditions are 1.5-2.0 t/ha
(seed cotton).
2.16      Sugarcane is an important cash crop.  All sugarcane is grown under
irrigation. While only 1% of the cropped area is currently devoted to
sugarcane, there is a tendency to expand the area as more land comes under
irrigation. Sugarcane is grown throughout the State. The average yield is
estimated at 75 t/ha, which is among the highest in India.
2.17      The mulberry area in the State is estimated at 110,000 ha, of
which about 27% is irrigated.  About 4% of the cropped area is planted to
an improved variety.  Although mulberry grows well in a wide range of soils
in the State, at present it is largely confined to the Eastern and Southern
Dry Zones.  Recently, evidence has accumulated that sericulture is feasible
in many other parts of the State. A rapid increase in mulberry planting is



- 12 -
therefore anticipated. 1/ Present average leaf yield is estimated at 3.0 t/ha
(rainfed) and 8.0 t/ha (irrigated), far below its potential (about 25-30 t/ha).
Due to high net returns, farmers are increasingly interested in this crop.
Agricultural Production Trends 2/
2.18      Between 1955/56 and 1977/78, foodgrain production grew only about
2.7% per annum, slightly above the population growth of 2.2%. Areas under
foodgrains declined while yields showed an increasing trend. The performance
of cash crops remained stagnant except for the production of sugarcane and
cotton, which increased at 5.7% and 2.9%, respectively. However, since these
crops only occupy a small portion of the total cropped areas, they did not
significantly affect the overall performance of the agricultural sector.
2.19      From the mid-50s to mid-60s, agriculture was characterized by both
area expansion and yield increases for most crops. Rice and jowar accounted
for most of the gains in foodgrains production which grew at a rate of 1.4%
per annum. Production of most cash crops, except for sugarcane, declined
by about 1-2% p.a. The trend changed significantly after 1967/68, with a
gradual introduction of HYV and rapid increase in the use of fertilizers
(11% p.a.). Increases in production of most crops during this period were
largely the result of impressive yield improvements particularly for jowar,
ragi, maize and wheat. This was, however, not the case for rice whose
yield only grew at a rate of 2% p.a. during this period. The performance
of cash crops has been mixed. Production of oilseeds remained relatively
unchanged from the previous period; sugarcane grew at a much slower rate
than before and cotton production increased spectacularly at 8.2% p.a.
mainly due to changes in varieties and corresponding yields. Because of
significant increases in foodgrain production since the mid-60s (about 3.4%
p.a.) Karnataka has become a net exporter of cereals. It is marginally
self-sufficient in pulses and edible oilseeds. GOK plans to stimulate the
diversification of the cropping pattern in the State towards more pulses,
oilseeds, horticultural crops and sericulture.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.20      General.  Agriculture in Karnataka experienced a faster growth in
the past than did India's agriculture as a whole (para 1.11). This may be
explained in part by a more advanced structure and performance of supporting
services such as extension and research, credit and input supply and marketing.
The proposed project, covering virtually the entire State, would build on the
satisfactory state of this supporting system; deficiencies still encountered
are usually common to all states and to be addressed at a more general level.

2.21      Agricultural Research.  The University of Agricultural Sciences
(UAS), established in 1965, is responsible for agricultural research. It has
two main campuses at Bangalore and Dharwar and five regional stations repre-
senting the main agro-climatic zones in the State. A network of 35 substa-
tions is dispersed throughout the State to provide location-specific testing
of research results. UAS owns some 600 ha of farmland and is staffed with
over 200 scientists. It also has about 80 Extension Units involved in testing
research findings on farmers' fields. Existing research facilities are
adequate for project support.
2.22      Agricultural Extension Services.  The "Training and Visit System"
has been introduced in Karnataka since 1978 assisted by IDA under the Composite
Extension Project (Credit 862-IN). The extension program under this project
is progressing well and now covers virtually all districts of the State.
There is a close linkage between the extension service and research provided
by UAS. The proposed project is expected to greatly benefit from the inten-
sity and coverage of the extension system.
2.23      Agricultural Inputs.  There is a well organized system for distri-
bution and sale of seeds, fertilizer and pesticides throughout the State.
Procurement and distribution is organized by the Karnataka State Cooperative
Marketing Federation, through Cooperative Marketing Societies. These socie-
ties are usually located in regulated markets at Taluk level where they
have offices and storage facilities. Primary agricultural credit cooperative
societies, functioning at village level, are members of marketing societies
from which they obtain fertilizers, pesticides and seeds for sale and distri-
bution to farmer members. Other outlets are the Department of Agriculture
and private dealers. Input prices are controlled by GOK. Many farmers retain
their own seed or buy or exchange seed with their neighbors.
2.24      Agricultural Credit.  Institutional credit organization follows
the normal pattern for India. The cooperative banks, which provide short
and medium term loans mainly for agricultural inputs at an annual rate of
11-12% to the farmer are organized on a three tier basis with the State
Cooperative Bank at the State level, 20 central banks at the district level
and 5,000 primary cooperatives at the village level. The State Land Develop-
ment Bank (LDB) is handling long term credit (up to 15 years) through 140
branches. Commercial Banks (CB) with 1,600 branches in the State, have just
started entering the field of agricultural lending. Most banks, particularly
LDBs, have had considerable experience of Bank Group supported lending, notably
through the Mysore Agricultural Credit Project (Cr. 278-IN) and three Agricul-
tural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC) Credit Projects (Credits
540-IN, 715-IN and 947-IN).
Marketing, Processing and Storage
2.25      Marketing in Karnataka is regulated under the Agriculture Produce
Marketing Act, 1966. Trade is controlled by the State Marketing Department
through local Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees. At present, there
are 115 main markets and 202 sub-markets under the control of the State



- 14 -
Marketing Department. 44 out of the 115 main markets are being further
developed with the assistance of an IDA credit (Cr. 378-IN, 8.0 M, 1973).
2.26      Private processing facilities exist in most major producing areas.
GOK is also encouraging the development of cooperative processing plants such
as sugar factories and textile mills; or in some cases, silk factories and
oil crushing units. The State Warehousing Corporation is developing storage
facilities in all major market yards and the Central Warehousing Corporation
has larger depots in the major centers.
III. THE IRRIGATION SUB-SECTOR
Water Resources
3.01      Three major river systems traverse the State.  The Krishna, Godavari,
and Cauvery--three of India's four largest rivers--originate in the Western
Ghats and flow across the Deccan Plateau before discharging into the Bay of
Bengal. They drain about 80% of the State's area. The remaining 20% of the
land area lie in the basins of smaller west-flowing rivers, the North Pennar,
South Pennar and Palar which rise on the western side of the Ghats and drain
into the AraVian Sea. The total discharge of the State's rivers is estimated
at 97,300 Mm , about half of which could be utilized. The potential for
development of these large surface water resources, however, is limited,
inter alia, because all the tributaries of the major rivers are seasonal,
and even in the case of the perennial rivers more than 90% of the total
flow occurs during the June-September monsoon when the need for irrigation
is lowest. Also, the Krishna, Godavari and Cauvery Rivers all have a major
part of their catchment in other States. The availability of water for
Karnataka depends, therefore, largely on interstate agreements. Because
plateau areas of the State are underlain by crystalline rocks, groundwater
aquifers are low yielding and costly to develop.  The State Groundwater Cell  3
estimates that the total groundwater potential of the State is about 11,700 Mm
Irrigation Potential and Utilization
3.02      At present, the irrigation potential and its utilization in the
State is roughly estimated as follows:
Potential Water   Presently          % of
Resource        Developed       Potential
Mm3    M h /a    Mm3   M ha/    Water  Area

59,000   5.80    20,800  1.90        35      33
/a   In terms of gross irrigated area (i.e., including double cropped
area).



- 15 -
The figures indicate the ample scope for further irrigation development from
both surface and groundwater resources. Development of groundwater resources
is undertaken mainly through private investments with financial support from
the institutional credit system. Through the Mysore Agricultural Credit
Project (Cr. 278-IN, 1971, US$40.0 M) and the line of credit to the Agri-
cultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC), the Bank Group has
supported and still is supporting groundwater development in Karnataka.
General Trends in Irrigation Development
3.03      Before Independence, the area under irrigation was less than 5% of
the total area under cultivation. Large scale irrigation development was
negligible and most of the irrigation was from tanks, small diversion weirs
and dugwells. A large number of major and medium projects were constructed
during the First and Second Five Year Plans (1950/51 to 1960/61). As a
result, by 1960/61, about 27% of the total net irrigated area were under
major and medium projects, 41% under tanks, 15% was irrigated from wells
and 17% by other sources.
3.04      Between 1960/61 and 1977/78, the total net irrigated area grew at a
rate of some 2.5% per annum. The expansion of irrigated areas under major and
medium projects and wells accounted for most of this growth. Irrigated areas
under tanks declined at annual rates of 0.6%. This was probably due to the
silting of tanks and, in some areas, due to switching from tank to canal and
well irrigation. Progress of irrigation development in terms of net irrigated
area in the State since 1960/61 is shown below:
1960/61  1965/66  1970/71  1977/78
--              000 ha-------------
Major & Mediums           235.8    360.4    448.7    561.9
Tanks                     343.7    329.3    364.8    347.5
Wells                     132.8    163.1    459.5    356.7
Others                    145.9    127.5      92.4    121.4
Total                     858.2    975.3   1365.4   1387.7
3.05      By 1977/78, the share of irrigated areas under major and medium
projects had increased to 40%, while those under tanks had diminished to 25%.
Irrigated areas under wells accounted for about 26% in 1977/78 as compared
to 15% in 1960/61, and other sources provided water for only 9% of the total
irrigated areas. In spite of this growth, only about 13% of the net area
sown in the State is irrigated. This proportion is one of the lowest in India
and far below the national average of 30%. The gross irrigated area (i.e.,
including multiple croppi;ig) accounted only for about 15% of the gross cropped
area. This is also less than half the national average.



- 16 -
Regional Pattern of Irrigation Development
3.06      There is a wide variation in the level of irrigation development
in the State. The high rainfall areas (hilly and coastal zones) have a
higher proportion of land irrigated than the lower rainfall areas (dry and
transitional zones). In 1977/78, the level of irrigation development in
different parts of the State was as follows:
Net
Irrigated Area
Zones            Rainfall   (as % of Net Area Sown)
(mm)
Dry              450-900             12.9
Transitional    600-1,300            11.5
Hilly          1,000-6,400           20.7
Coastal        3,000-3,700           36.4
State                                13.5
3.07      Between 1960/61 to 1977/78, virtually all of the increase in
irrigated area occurred in the dry and transitional zones. This indicates
that GOK's investment policy for irrigation has largely been oriented towards
an equalization of the level of irrigation development in different parts
of the State. Special emphasis has been given to projects in drought prone
and economically backward areas.
3.08      An examination of the sources of irrigation indicates that the high
level of irrigation development in the high rainfall areas is mainly due to
private investments in groundwater, river lift schemes and both public and
private investments in tanks. On the other hand, in dry and transitional
zones, a large part of the irrigated areas developed were under major and
medium schemes (canals). In 1977/78, the following pattern emerged:
Zones                 Canals    Tanks       Wells    Other    Total
---------    % of total ----------         %
Dry                     49         19        28        4        100
Transitional            35         30        26        9        100
Hilly                    9         74         2       15        100
Coastal                 -           7        25       67        100
The Role of Irrigation in Karnataka's Agricultural Development
3.09      Between 1960/61 and 1975/76, the gross value of crop production 1/
increased by about 38%, or 2.2% p.a. The growth in production from irrigated
areas existing in 1960/61 contributed about 18% to the overall increase, while
1/   At constant 1975/76 prices.



- 17 -
the balance of increases of production on new irrigated areas and correspond-
ing losses of rainfed production on the same area contributed about 52%, and
the growth of production on rainfed areas (as existing in 1960/61) contributed
about 30%. The shift from rainfed to irrigated cultivation alone, even if
yields had not increased during this period, contributed about 37% of overall
growth. Yields on irrigated areas improved at a moderate rate of 1.9% p.a.
whereas those on rainfed land grew only at about 1.3% p.a. (A detailed
presentation of the structure of growth in both sectors is to be found in
Annex 1, T-2). This indicates that the expansion of irrigation facilities
and the associated yield improvements have been the major contribution to
the growth of agricultural production.
Bank Group Involvement
3.10      The Bank Group is directly involved in surface irrigation development
in Karnataka through the Karnataka Irrigation Project (Cr. 788-IN, US$126.0 M,
1978). The project finances a five year time slice of the development of the
Upper Krishna project, estimated to require 15 years for completion.' The
project made a slow start, mainly due to procurement problems. -Tt has now
picked up momentum and progress in construction of dams and main canals is
satisfactory. Planning and implementation of the distribution system and
command area development suffer from lack of experienced staff and inadequate
cooperation between the Command Area Development Authority and the Irrigation
Department. The road component suffers from inadequate funding as well as
organization and staffing deficiencies. These issues have been raised with
GOK and are being followed up.
3.11      The Bank Group also supported groundwater development through the
Mysore Agricultural Credit Project (Cr. 278-IN, US$40.0 M, 1972) which was
completed in 1977. The Performance Audit Report (No. 2892, 1980) on this
project concluded that the project exceeded its target in terms of numbers of
minor irrigation investments financed (51,000 wells and 27,000 pumpsets vs.
16,000 wells estimated at appraisal). Also against appraisal expectations,
farmers preferred by far the more economical and less risky dugwells against
borewells. Only half of the wells and about two thirds of the pumpset invest-
ments financed under the project were completed at the end of the project
period; most of the balance were to be completed under IDA's first and second
line of credit to ARDC.  In spite of a higher number of investments, total
irrigated area increased only modestly due to a smaller benefiting area per
well than was estimated at appraisal. Moreover, cost per well turned out to
be higher than anticipated. Nevertheless, groundwater investments, where
feasible, proved to be economically well justified and financially profitable
to farmers. Through a third line of credit to the ARDC, funds from IDA are
made available to refinance credits for private groundwater investments as
well as land levelling and land shaping, through Land Development Bank and
commercial banks.

IV.  PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING TANK IRRIGATION PROJECTS
General
4.01      Tanks were constructed as early as the 12th century.  Many old tanks
still exist and are operational. At present, there are about 41,000 tanks,
widely dispersed throughout the State. Of these, about 25,000 tanks with
a command area above four ha each are owned and operated since 1949 (after
Independence) by the State's Irrigation Department (ID). Another 16,000
tanks, with less than four ha command area each, are under control of Taluk
Development Boards. Together, the 41,000 tanks cover a nominal command area
of about 850,000 ha. However, the actual irrigated area is probably not more
than 350,000 ha.
Design and Operation
4.02      As indicated in the introduction to this report, tanks are designed
to catch and store runoff from streams and minor rivers during the rainy
season. They serve the double purpose of protecting the standing crop
from dry spells during the kharif season which in dry areas would destroy
the crop, and to facilitate the growing of a second crop. Since catchment
and command area are usually subject to similar climatic conditions, high
irrigation demand occurs typically in seasons with low runoff from the catch-
ment and therefore low water supply. Therefore, and since the protective use
has absolute priority, a second crop is usually only possible in good rainfall
years. Due to the drought protection objective, command areas have usually
been defined as large as possible, so as to reach a maximum of beneficiaries.
4.03      The design of the reservoir (dam and overflow section) is usually
based on empirical formulae, i.e., on standard correlations of annual rainfall
and runoff, given the characteristics of the catchment area, rather than on
actual rainfall/runoff relationships observed at the site (see Annex 6).
This, of course, is almost inevitable given the number of tanks developed and
the paucity in stream gauging stations. Only recently have actual measure-
ments at a few tank sites been started. While nothing is known about the
hydrological criteria used for very old tanks, actual performance indicates
that the design of overflow structures seems to be satisfactory. 1/  Only very
few tanks breach every year; in such a case, the damage is mostly confined to
agricultural areas on the banks of the stream.  A major problem for existing
tanks is the silting of the reservoir, caused by unstable, over-cultivated
catchment areas or by excessive forest clearing.  Silting reduces the potential
of the tanks to store water and is one of the reasons for the gap observed
between areas commanded by the tank canal system and the actual irrigated
area. 2/
1/   More recent engineering practice makes use of an empirical formula to
estimate peak runoff (Ryve's Formula), or unit hydrographs for tank
catchments.
2/   The criteria for implementation of the proposed project stress the need
for adequate catchment protection works in unstable catchment areas
(para 5.08). However, since siltation affects "dead storage" first,
no adverse effects are expected from such process before about 50 years
of project life.

4.04      The distribution system in most cases consists of unlined main
canals (usually two, one on each side of the stream) with outlets leading
either directly to the fields or to long, poorly shaped and uncontrolled field
channels. Main canals are usually rather long (up to 15 km), in order to
serve a generously defined command area, which results in high conveyance
losses. Where there are only few cross regulators and gated outlets, opera-
tional staff is unable to regulate the water supply adequately. Farmers at
the head of the system or of a particular outlet command are free to take more
than their share of water. Water often flows from field to field towards the
main drain, even in the case of crops other than paddy, not permitting control
of amount and timing of water application. These and other "operational"
losses are estimated to account for about 20% of overall losses.
4.05      Unlined channels cause excessive seepage losses.  A recent study in
three tanks in gravelly soils shows that losses are in the range of 63 to 78
cusecs per million square feet, a range of values many times larger than the
normally assumed losses (about 8-10 cusecs per million square feet). Along
the entire length of a channel, 40-80% of the head discharge are lost. As a
result, no water reaches the middle and tail-end fields in the command areas.
4.06      Operation of tanks is presently under the instruction of a Govern-
ment irrigation officer, who consults with the Taluk Development Committee (a
committee consisting of concerned government staff and local farmers' repre-
sentatives). The officer has the authority under the Karnataka Irrigation Act
(1965) to specify time, period and quantity of water releases as well as the
area to be served. Such decisions are made public for each tank before the
irrigation season and are known to the farmers. A canal inspector, or
Nalamanegar, from the staff of the Irrigation Department, regulates the supply
at the gated reservoir outlet, while further distribution among outlets to
field channels is carried out by auxiliary staff, called Sowdies (also
employed by the Government). In larger tanks, each Sowdi is responsible
for a section of the canal serving about 200 ha. Night irrigation occurs
in time of heavy demand (paddy pre-planting and transplanting periods).
Farmers generally know the day and time of water supply to their outlet, but
are not aware of the exact time and quantity to be supplied to their individual
holdinigs. Although there are no formal organizations within a tank command,
informal arrangements for water-sharing exist inside the outlet command.
However, these arrangements are precarious and often result in inequitable
distribution of water.
4.07      Water supply is rotated in many tanks between groups of outlets for
periods at one to two week intervals in order to maximize flows to the lower
reaches of the system. However, with the prevailing features of the canal
system, sufficient flow to tailenders is the exception rather than the rule.
Where double cropping is only possible for part of the command area, supply
of water is rotated betwe2n parts of the system (usually along one of the main
canals) on a yearly basic,.
4.08      Maintenance of reservoir structures and canals is the responsibility
of the Irrigation Department. The farmers do not contribute to these works
directly; however, they have to maintain their own field channels. Due to
a low density of supervisory staffing, and due to the unlined canals and



- 20 -
channels, maintenance of the distribution network is often less than satis-
factory, leading to higher operational losses. Higher standards of main-
tenance can be expected for lined systems and with more participation and
interest in a properly functioning system on the part of benefiting farmers.
Project Formulation
4.09       About 54% of the State's geographical area is drought prone compared
to 16% of the total area in India. While, on average, only about 10% of the
population in India live in drought prone areas, at least 50% of the popula-
tion of Karnataka live in such areas. Furthermore, only about 13% of the net
area sown in the State is irrigated, which is one of the lowest ratios in
India and far below the national average of 30%. Therefore, expansion of
irrigation facilities is one of the highest priorities in GOK's agricultural
development plan. Given the limited scope for further groundwater develop-
ment, 1/ GOK plans to accelerate development of surface irrigation projects.
Within the latter, minor surface irrigation projects have a high priority
because of their effect on regional equity and rural poverty.
4.09       During the current Five-Year Plan (1980/81 to 1984/85), GOK will
allocate about US$126 M of its development budget to minor irrigation programs.
Out of this, about US$18 M will be spent during 1980/81 for completing on-
going minor schemes. The remaining US$108 M will be used for constructing new
tanks, lift irrigation schemes and for repair of existing schemes. GOK has
proposed to IDA a project consisting of the construction of about 120-160 new
tanks covering an aggregate area of some 25,000 ha at a cost of US$77 M during
four years (1981/82 - 1984/85). The reason for including only new tank irri-
gation schemes under the proposed project is to experiment with new planning
and design criteria, the effect of which would be carefully monitored and
evaluated. Lessons learned would subsequently be applied to the modernization
of existing tanks.
V. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
5.01       The proposed project is formulated with the following objectives:
(a) spread irrigation to areas where large scale irrigation
development is not feasible;
(b) achieve more economic use of scarce surface water resources;
(c) ensure a more reliable irrigation supply to consumers;
(d) build up GOK's capability to prepare, appraise, supervise
and evaluate irrigation projects;
1/   Groundwater development is also mainly a private activity, albeit
supported by subsidized institutional credit.



- 21 -
(e) increase farmers' participation in the operation of tank
irrigation projects (TIPs); and
(f) improve the hydrological data base for minor surface
irrigation projects.
Project Components
5.02      The proposed project would finance:
(a)  Construction, over a four-year period, of 120-160 TIPs
throughout the State, estimated to irrigate some 25,000 ha;
(b)  a rainfall and stream gauging network to improve the hydro-
logical data base for the planning of future minor irrigation
projects;
(c)  development of an improved model for catchment runoff
estimation; and
(d)  a study of possible approaches to the formation of water
users' organizations.
Description of a Tank Irrigation System
5.03      Under the proposed credit, individual TIPs would cover cultivable
command areas of between 20 and 2,000 ha. Each TIP would generally consist
of:
(a)  an earthfill embankment to create a reservoir, with an ungated
spillway and head regulator(s);
(b)  a fully lined canal network which would deliver water through
outlets serving approximately 8 ha blocks;
(c)  a system of normally unlined field channels within the 8 ha
blocks; and
(d)  a drainage network connected to natural drains.
Project Scope and Unit Cost
5.04      Project scope, i.e. the total area to come under irrigation through
the proposed project, depends on the average cost per ha. Cost per ha is
subject to some uncertainty, since only a fraction of the planned TIPs have
been fully designed and costed. 1/ Analysis of available cost estimates shows
1/   GOK has prepared nine model projects, one for each agroclimatic zone of
the State (except Northern Transition Zone). Out of the nine, six proj-
ects have been selected as typical. Their features, design criteria and
cost estimates are shown in Annex 1, T-4 and T-5. Some modifications
to cost estimates were made by the mission to reflect improved design
standards for the distribution and drainage systems.



- 22 -
considerable variation between TIPs, even between TIPs of similar size, in
terms of cost per ha as well as cost per unit of water deliverable at the
tank outlet. On the basis of available information, and of separate cost
estimates for the reservoir (embankments and overflow) and for the distri-
bution system for various sizes of TIPs, a typical cost estimate for five
different size groups of TIPs has been developed (Annex 1, T-3). More extreme
deviations from the assumed norm due to particular topographical conditions,
have been disregarded to arrive at this estimate. The cost of the tank itself
accounts typically for about 75-80% of the total cost of a TIP, the cost of
the distribution and drainage system accounting for the rest. However, cost
per ha of the reservoir varies considerably with size, decreasing for larger
units to about 60% of project cost. This economy of scale outweighs by far
a higher per ha cost of the canal system in larger projects, resulting in a
lower per ha total cost for larger TIPs. With the social objective of spread-
ing the benefits of the project more widely in a geographical sense, especially
in drought prone areas, GOK intends to build about one third of the TIPs in
the size group between 20-100 ha, another third between 100 to 200 ha, and the
balance larger than 200 ha. The average size of the TIPs financed would be
about 230 ha. Depending on the actual cost of the projects built, the number
of tanks financed might be reduced, with possible changes also in the size
distribution. The weighted 1/ average cost per ha of CCA (in 1980 prices)
is estimated at about Rs 21,300.  This includes physical contingencies and
overhead for design and supervision, as well as the cost of land acquisition.
The estimated unit cost is higher than for medium and large surface irrigation
projects (Rs 11,000-13,000/ha), firstly because tanks per se are somewhat more
costly than larger schemes, and secondly because of the deliberate policy of
including a larger number of relatively small TIPs in the construction program.
However, smaller schemes have considerably shorter gestation periods, about
one to one and a half years for the smallest (20-100 ha). (The average
construction period is assumed to be about 3 years.) Also, TIPs have generally
higher conveyance efficiencies than medium and large schemes, and are more
manageable in terms of efficient operation.3  Assuming an annual water avail-
ability at the reservoir of about 10,800 m /ha of CCA, the average cost per
cubic meter of water is estimated at about Rs 1.97. Given the funds budgeted
for the Tank Irrigation3Program, 2/ the project would provide water to some
25,000 ha (about 270 Mm in an average year).
5.05      The proposed regional distribution of TIPs would favor the dry zones
of the State with 52% of the proposed CCA and 65% of the projects, and the
transitional zones with 36% of proposed CCA and 29% of the projets. The
balance would be in the coastal and hilly zones. The tentative regional and
size-wise distribution of TIPs is shown in Annex 1, T-6.
1/   Weights being derived from the size distribution intended by GOK.
2/   About Rs 524 M after allowing for price contingencies (23%).  This does
not include expenditures for other project related works or operations,
such as a catchment protection program or resettlement of displaced
families, to be financed from other budget funds.

Criteria for Tank Irrigation Projects
5.06      General.  In view of the proposed dispersion of the tank project
throughout the State, detailed appraisal by IDA of each tank would be quite
impractical. Therefore, criteria for planning, design, implementation,
operation and economic viability have been developed and discussed between
GOI, GOK and IDA for projects to be financed from the credit. An assurance
has been obtained from GOK that TIPs financed under the credit would follow
the agreed criteria. The criteria are described in detail in Annex 2 and
are summarized below:
Planning Criteria
5.07      Basic Data Requirements for a Tank Project:  (i) topographical
map; (ii) reconnaissance type soil survey and land classification dividing
the area commanded into three categories: areas suited for paddy, areas
suited for both paddy and upland crops, and areas suited for upland crops
only; (iii) data for three years (minimum) of rainfall in the catchment and
its correlation with actual streamflow data for the tank site (exceptions
see under para 5.08 (i) below; (iv) sediment samples to be taken at or near
each tank site for determination of expected sediment levels in the reser-
voir for all tanks with more than 1,000 ha CCA.
5.08      Hydrology.  Actual streamflow data observed at the tank site and
correlated with observed rainfall in the catchment over a period of at least
three years should be used wherever possible to estimate the annual and
monthly design runoff from a catchment. In order to improve the hydrological
data base for TIPs to be constructed in the last years of the proposed project
as well as for schemes to be built thereafter, a long term streamflow and
rainfall gauging program would be started immediately (paras 5.25-5.28 below).
In cases where actual measurements of streamflows are not yet available
(during the first years of the project) or where they will not be available in
the future (for small TIPs), runoff estimates should either be based on data
from nearby catchments with similar characteristics for which observations
are available, or on the use of Strange's method (see Annex 6) after proper
classification of the catchment. A more accurate system of runoff yield
estimation, based on "continuous water balance methods," would be developed
and adapted to Karnataka conditions in the first year(s) of the proposed
project (para 5.29 below). It would, when successfully implemented, replace
the methods mentioned above for ungauged or poorly gauged catchments.
The hydrological basis for the planning and design of TIPs would thus be
considerably improved after two to three years.
5.09      In addition, rain gauges should be installed in the catchment area
of all TIPs serving more than 150 ha and daily rainfall records should be main-
tained. (Self recording gauges for TIPs with more than 1,000 ha command.)
For other TIPs, the nearest existing rain gauging station should be used.
Where existing tanks are located in the catchment area of a proposed TIP, a
25% return flow can be assumed from an existing upstream irrigation scheme.
The impact of the proposed TIP on existing downstream schemes should be care-
fully assessed. For an estimate of the net impact, a 25% return flow from
the proposed TIP can be assumed. If the estimated reduction of inflows to



- 24 -
the existing downstream scheme would exceed 5% of the design yield for that
scheme, the proposed TIP would have to be submitted to IDA for review and
approval.
5.10      Otb>r Planning Criteria.  (i) To avoid erosion of the catchment and
silting of tanks, the need for catchment protection works should be assessed,
based on maps depicting slopes, soils, land capability, erosion and vegetative
cover of the catchment. Appropriate measures should be outlined and included
in the project proposal. They would be part of the TIP and eligible for reim-
bursement from the proposed IDA credit. (ii) GOI's project preparation and
monitoring cell has prepared, in cooperation with GOK, standard cropping pat-
terns, which should be suitably modified for each TIP in order to take account
of soil surveys and the existing cropping pattern in the proposed area; special
care should be taken against an under-estimation of the probable paddy area
in the future with project. (iii) The project formulation cells established
under the project should, in cooperation with concerned departments, carry out
surveys on the existing agricultural supporting services in the area and
propose arrangements for any necessary strengthening of such services.
5.11      Water Requirements:  (i) The modified Penman method 1/ should be
used to estimate crop water requirements; (ii) monthly evapotranspiration
rates (ETo) for each agroclimatic zone should be taken from zone-wise ETo
estimates prepared by GOI's Project Preparation and Monitoring Cell; (iii)
based on long-term rainfall records in the proposed command area or at a
nearby station, effective rainfall would be calculated as 50% of the 50%
dependable rainfall during the monsoon, and as 65% of such rainfall during
the non-monsoon season; (iv) irrigation requirements for paddy should include
allowances for land preparation, nursery and transplanting (200-250 mm), deep
percolation (2-4 mm/day) and for maintaining a water depth of about 50 mm; (v)
preplanting irrigation requirements should be scheduled for upland Kharif and
late Rabi crops; (vi) the conveyance efficiency should not be assumed higher
than 85%; (vii) assumed field irrigation efficiencies should be based on soil
characteristics and should not exceed 90% for paddy and 70% for diversified
(upland) crops, (viii) a month-by-month tank operation study for the design
year should be carried out.
5.12      Dams, Embankments and Appurtenant Structures.  Criteria and stan-
dards for design and safety of earthen dams laid down by GOI and GOK and
applicable to small dams should be observed in addition to sound and accepted
engineering practice. Planning, design and construction of larger dams would
be subject to recommendations and approval by a Dam Safety Panel (see paras
5.22-5.24 below). The design of overflows structures should also be based
on results from the improved model for runoff estimation (continuous water
balance methods), once this is developed, since it would be capable of more
accurate estimates of peak runoff (para 5.29 below).
Design Criteria
5.13      Distribution System:   (i) Design and Layout of canaLs and iield
channels should be completed down to the individual holding; for very small
1/   FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24.



- 25 -
holdings, water would be supplied to I ha; (ii) the head capacity of supply
channels should be designed according to a formula which takes into account
the expected mix of paddy and upland crops (between 0.7 liter/second and 1.2
liter/second per ha); (iii) the design should permit rotational water supply
and small systems should be designed for daylight irrigation only; (iv) the
complete system should be lined down to turnouts serving about 8 ha subunits. 1/
Lining should be extended, if necessary, so that the distance between lined
channels and farm gates does not exceed 300 m; (v) part of the field channels
should be lined in case of permeable soils or of slopes exceeding 2%, so that
the unlined length of a channel does not exceed 100 m; (vi) all outlets
and turnouts should be gated; (vii) field channels should have adequate
structures, especially protective drop structures; (viii) measuring devices
should be installed at the outlets from the tank and main channels and at
each 1 ha outlet; (ix) cross regulators in the main channel would permit
full discharge at take-off points when the channel is flowing at less than
50% capacity.
5.14      Drainage System:  (i) Adequate cross drainage works should be built
along the main channels, as well as cut-off drains on the up-hill side of such
channels; and (ii) in the command area, a system of drainage channels designed
to drain a runoff at a rate of three liter/second/ha should be built and
connected to natural drains.
5.15      Communication:  (i) An all-weather access road should be provided
to the tank; (ii) according to size of channels, all-weather service roads or
motorcycle/bicycle paths would be built along main and distributary channels.
Implementation Criteria
5.16      Construction Practices:  (i) Canal embankments and earthfill around
structures should be thoroughly compacted by mechanical equipment; and (ii)
to ensure proper settlement of foundation in minor channels, sections would
be thoroughly saturated by ponding or exposure to one season of rainfall
before lining.
5.17      Implementation:  (i) Construction periods should be planned not to
exceed two years for smaller TIPs (< 400 ha), three years for medium size TIPs
(< 1000 ha) and four years for larger ones, excluding time needed for prelim-
inary works such as construction of approach roads, which should not last
longer than one year; (ii) large TIPs should be commissioned in blocks not
more than 400 ha in size; (iii) water should not be released until all field
channels have been completed and the TIP (or a section of it) has been com-
missioned; (iv) lining should be tested by ponding before commissioning; if
seepage losses of more than 3 cusec/M sq ft occur, lining should be rectified;
and (v) commissioning would include tests to determine whether water reaches
all parts of the CCA.
1/   An economic justification of lining is given in Annex 8.



- 26 -
5.18      Cost Estimates:  (i) Estimates should be based on current depart-
mental rates or recent local bid prices; (ii) they should include physical
contingencies of 10% for work already designed in detail and 20% for all
other works, and (iii) should include cost of land acquisition, settlement
of displaced families (if any) and of approach and service road^.
Operation Criteria
5.19      Water Release:  (i) Discharge from outlets/turnouts to field
channels should normally be about one cusec, and not less than one half
cusec; (ii) water release to farmers should initially follow a fixed
schedule 1/ prepared for each season; and (iii) releases for upland crops
should be rotated every ten days.
5.20      Tank Irrigation Committee (TIC).  A TIC should be formed imme-
diately after construction of a tank has been sanctioned. The TIC should be
consulted by the Irrigation Department (ID) before finalizing the design of
a TIP. Although the ID would keep, for the time being, full responsibility
for the physical maintenance of the system above the irrigation outlets, the
TIC would share with the ID the responsibility for operation (water schedul-
ing) and possibly maintenance of the system. Until the proposed Study on
Water User's Organizations (para 5.26) would be completed, GOK should, on an
experimental basis, initiate formation of such committees in at least three
selected new TIPs.
Economic Criteria
5.21      Individual TIPs should have an economic rate of return exceeding
12%, based on estimated annual costs and benefits discounted over 50 years.
To facilitate economic evaluation, total financial cost per cubic meter of
water available in the design year at the reservoir outlet should be compared
to a critical limit derived and tabulated for the agroclimatic zones by IDA
(Annex 2, Appendix). (These cut-off rates should be increased each year by
the estimated rate of inflation for civil works.)   A TIP could be approved
if its unit cost of water is below the critical limit for the respective zone.
Critical cost limits were derived in such a way as to assure a minimum rate
of return of 12% for the individual TIP, based on benefits projected for each
agroclimatic zone by IDA. GOK may submit a TIP to IDA for special approval
in cases when GOK deems the project justifiable although its cost exceeds the
cut-off rate.
Dam Safety
5.22      Design and construction standards for the comparatively small dams
of most TIPs would follow sound engineering practice, and adequate quality
control would be providel under the proposed organization (para 6.03 below).
1/   A mote flexible water supply schedule should be started after an initial
period of fixed rotations. The more flexible schedule would be geared
to the needs of the actual crops grown below each outlet. The Tank
Irrigation Committee would gradually involve itself in this more
sophisticated scheduling.



- 27 -
However, there would be a number of TIPs which due to their larger size would
warrant special attention to design and construction standards of dams and
related structures, as well as to regular maintenance. A special Dam Review
Panel has been constituted by GOK to undertake periodic and comprehensive
reviews of plans, designs and construction procedures of these iarger dams
or embankments with the objective of ascertaining and reporting on their
general safety and performance. In the following cases this review would be
necessary:
(a) if the proposed height of the embankment above streambed
exceeds 10 m, or;
(b)  if the gross storage behind the embankment exceeds 2.5 Mm
at full reservoir level, or;
(c) if the proposed location of the embankment is such that
significant destruction would occur in case of its failure.
5.23      The Panel would review and evaluate all data and design and construc-
tion procedures and make specific recommendations to GOK concerning embankment
safety, foundation, abutment integrity and spillway adequacy. This review
would be required specifically at the time when foundation preparation work
has been completed and before embankment placement has progressed very far,
and at such other times during construction as is necessary or desirable.
The Panel's role should not be viewed as one of assisting or guiding the
executing Irrigation Department, since responsibility for proper design and
construction, including quality control, rests with GOK. Rather it should
be considered as a review body of technical experts whose judgment and opinions
on particular technical matters would carry considerable weight in the evalua-
tion of proposed actions by the project administration. Agreed terms of refer-
ence (TOR) for the Panel, which have been more or less standardized for other
IDA-financed projects, are included as Annex 4. The TOR require that the
Panel submit a written report containing their review, comments, and recom-
mendations within 60 days following each convening of the Panel. The report
should be made available to IDA and to such bodies within GOI which may be
assigned safety-of-dam responsibilities for their review.
5.24      An assurance has been obtained from GOK, that it would maintain its
Dam Review Panel with TOR, experience and qualifications agreed with IDA for
the above mentioned purposes. Any costs incurred for activities of the panel
in relation with the project would be eligible for reimbursement under the
proposed credit.
Rainfall and Stream Gauging Network
5.25      To improve the data base for planning of future TIPs, about 1000
new fiberglass raingauges would be installed to supplement approximately 220
raingauge sites that presently meet Indian Meterological Department (IMD)
standards. At present there are only 31 self recording raingauges in the
State; according to IMD standards about 10% of the 1,200 sites would be
self recording. The raingauge sites would be installed in small catchments
which already have or for which there are proposals to install stream
gauging stations.



- 28 -
5.26      There are presently 124 gauge-discharge measuring sites on streams
within the State; discharges at 89 sites are measured with current meters and
35 by recording reservoir levels.  However, most of the above sitef have been
established in catchments with drainage areas greater than 5000 km . In order
to improve the data base for smaller catchments it is proposed to add 100 new
stream discharge measuring sites throughout the State. Appropriate equipment
would be financed under the proposed credit (Annex 1, T-7).
5.27      As an additional basis for estimation of evapotranspiration rates
for various agro-climatic zones within the State, to be used in crop water
requirement calculations, it is recommended that six new hydrometerological
stations be established within the State to supplement presently available
data. There are presently 45 such stations within the State. In addition,
evaporation data should be supplemented in six of the existing sites by
installing Class "A" pan evaporimeters. Equipment for this purpose would
be financed from the credit (Annex 1, T-7).
5.28      It is proposed that the raingauge and hydrometerological stations
be operated and maintained by the IMD while the stream gauging program be
carried out by the Irrigation Department. The data is critically needed
to improve estimates of water supplies by allowing the introduction of new
methodologies. Improved estimates of water supplies will assure a sound
investment program in the future.
Development of an Improved Hydrological Forecasting System
5.29      Improvements in the estimation of catchment runoff over traditional
empirical formulae can be made through use of modern hydrological techniques
and computing equipment. The development of "continuous water balance"
simulation/estimation models has produced excellent results in many parts of
the world. Such models take into account daily distribution and intensity
of rainfall, rather than monthly or annual aggregates only, as well as such
catchment characteristics as potential evapotranspiration, soil properties,
vegetation, topography, drainage channels and man-made changes. Recent tests
of a continuous water balance model in the Narmada Basin of Madhya Pradesh
State have shown its usefulness for tropical monsoon environments. In order
to make this technology available to Karnataka for the proposed project and
other future projects, a computerized hydrological forecasting system would be
developed, tested, calibrated and commissioned under the coordination of the
Karnataka Engineering Research Station at Mysore and with technical assistance
from an experienced hydrological institute, under terms of reference to be
agreed with IDA. Simultaneously, training would be provided by the institute
for about two local hydrologists in the use of the model and the computing
equipment. The cost of technical assistance and training is estimated not
to exceed about US$70,000, the cost of necessary computing equipment (desk-
computer and plotter) to be about US$35,000. These costs would be reimbursed
from the proposed credit.
Water Users' Organization Study
5.30      One of the objectives of the project is to increase farmers' parti-
cipation in the operation of TIPs. A study of possible approaches to water
users' organizations would be undertaken and completed by March 31, 1983. It

would investigate existing farmers' organization and cooperation within tank
command areas, in order to recommend means for establishing viable and effec-
tive participation of irrigators in operation and maintenance of TIPs financed
under the project. Under IDA supervision, the study would be carried out by
the Indian InLtitute of Management (IIM) in Bangalore, with assistance from
the Minor Irrigation Wing Staff of the Irrigation Department. The terms of
reference for the study have been developed and discussed between GOK and IDA,
and are given in Annex 3.
Project Costs and Financing
5.31      The proposed project would support a four year time-slice of the
GOK construction program of about 120-160 new TIPs. The proposed IDA credit
would finance expenditures on TIPs planned, designed and constructed in
accordance with the agreed criteria (paras 5.07-5.21) during the period
1981/82 to 1984/85. Total project cost would be Rs 650 M (US$77.4 M) with
a foreign exchange component of Rs 84.5 M or about 13% of total cost. Taxes
and duties are insignificant and therefore not included. Price contingencies
have been estimated as about 23% of base cost for the tank construction
program. Price contingencies for equipment are estimated as about 10%.
They are negligible for technical assistance (study and forecasting model).

5.32      The proposed IDA credit of US$54.0 M (SDR 43.5 M) would finance
about 70% of total project cost including the foreign exchange component
(US$10.0 M) and about 65% of local cost. All expenditures would be met by GOK
from its development budget which includes a GOI contribution. An assurance
has been obtained from GOK that it would promptly provide funds to execute the
project in accordance with the schedule of expenditures (Annex 1, T-9). IDA
would annually exchange views with GOK on the implementation program for the
construction of TIPs. The proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit
is presented in Annex 1, T-10. An assurance has been obtained from GOI that
proceeds of the credit would be channeled to GOK in accordance with standard
arrangements for development assistance with the States of India.

Procurement
5.33      Civil works under the project would be individually small and scat-
tered over the whole State. Construction would be seasonal and carried out
through labor-intensive methods. Consequently, it would neither be feasible
nor economic to group them into large contracts. Present practice of GOK is
to award most of the construction works for dams, spillways and main canals
after local competitive bidding (LCB), and the practice would be followed
under the proposed project. The Central Water Commission of GOI has recently
developed guidelines for procurement procedures for civil works which have
been approved by IDA. GOK would adopt these guidelines for procurement under
the proposed credit. For contracts costing more than the equivalent of
US$200,000, review by IDA of tender documents and award recommendation would
be required prior to award. It is expected that due to the remoteness and
small size of some works stand&rd LCB procedures would not attract any contrac-
tors' response. In these cases, unit price contracts would be awarded on the
basis of rates established by competitive bidding each year. Some minor works
would be carried out through GOK's Employment Affirmation Scheme. Departmental
work would be used only when required by safety or quality considerations.
The stream and rain gauging equipment and the computing equipment would be
procured under LCB procedures acceptable to IDA.
Disbursement
5.34      Disbursements would be made for:  (i) 100% of foreign exchange cost
for goods directly imported; (ii) 100% of local manufactured goods procured
ex-factory; (iii) 70% for other locally procured goods; (iv) 100% of expendi-
tures on technical assistance and of cost of training; and (v) 85% of expendi-
tures on civil works. Disbursements against payments less than Rs 300,000
for civil works and less than Rs 150,000 for equipment would be made against
statement of expenditures submitted by GOK. The same arrangement would be
applied to disbursements on departmental work, without cost limit per payment.
Supporting documents for these payments would be retained by GOK and made
available for inspection by IDA during the course of review missions. The
procedures for statements of expenditures have been well established under the
on-going Karnataka Irrigation Project (Cr. 788-IN) and are satisfactory to
IDA. The estimated semi-annual disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 1,
T-ll. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by March 31, 1986.
Accounts and Audits
5.35      The project would be subject to normal Government control and audit-
ing procedures which are satisfactory. A resident Audit Officer, representing
the State Accountant General would audit the project accounts. Statements of
account certified by the Accountant General or his designee supported by an
itemized account and a summary of expenditures would be submitted to IDA as
soon as possible after the end of each fiscal year. Assurances have been
obtained from GOK that: (i) it would maintain separate accounts on project
expenditures; (ii) it would ensure that these accounts would be audited
annually by the Accountant General; (iii) the resulting reports would be
submitted to IDA as soon as possible but not later than nine months after
the end of each fiscal year; and (iv) that it would make complete accounts
and financial statements available for inspection during IDA review missions.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Irrigation Department
6.01      The Irrigation Department (ID) is headed by a Special Secretary,
Irrigation who reports directly to the Chief Secretary, GOK. The department's
organization is flexible and adjusted to the workload. At present, it has
ten branches, each headed by a Chief Engineer with functional and/or regional
responsibilities. Branches important for the proposed project are:
(a) The Water Resources Development Organization (WRDO) with
headquarters at Bangalore is entrusted with general estab-
lishment matters of the Irrigation Department and other
items such as water disputes pertaining to Krishna, Godavari
and Cauvery, river gauging, preparation of the Water Year
Book, maintenance of water accounts of river valleys,
investigation, planning, design of major and medium surface
irrigation projects, and inspection of machinery and equip-
ment of the Department all over the State. There are 3
circles and 4 divisions, with sub-divisions in the field.
(b) The Karnataka Engineering Research Station acts as an advisor
and consultant in solving the problem of field engineers in
charge of irrigation and hydroelectric projects and as test
house for field problems. Its activities include design and
research on dams and water conveyance systems, studies on
return flow and silting of reservoirs, as well as studies on
crop water requirements. The station has 5 divisions.
(c)  The Minor Irrigation Wing is in charge of planning, imple-
mentation and operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes
with less than 2,000 ha command area (minor schemes). It is
divided into two regional branches, each headed by a Chief
Engineer:
(i) Minor Irrigation (South) oversees minor schemes in
11 districts. Its headquarters are at Bangalore.
(ii) Minor Irrigation (North) is in charge of minor schemes
in the remaining 8 districts of the State. Its head-
quarters are at Dharwar.
The Minor Irrigation Wing (MIW)
6.02      Existing Organization.  The direct responsibility for planning
implementation, operation and maintenance of tank irrigation projects (TIPs)
would rest with the Minor Irrigation Wing of ID. As mentioned above, the
MIW has two Chief Engineers who report directly to the Special Secretary,
Irrigation. The two Chief Engineers are assisted by 10 Superintending
Engineers (SEs). Six are in charge of investigation, construction, operation
and maintenance (OEM), and monitoring of the minor irrigation works; two are
responsible for preparing designs and cost estimates. Each Superintending



- 32 -
Engineer is in charge of 2-3 districts and has about 3-8 divisions headed
by Executive Engineers (EEs). Each-EE has about 5 subdivisions headed by
Assistant Engineers (AEs) and is supported by engineering and clerical staff.
At present, the MIW has 2 design cells, 8 investigation divisions and 36
construction and O&M divisions dispersed throughout the State.
6.03      Proposed Organization (Annex 1, C-1).  To improve the implementation
capacity of the Minor Irrigation Wing under the project, a Project Formulation
Cell (PFC) has been established in each of the offices of the two Chief
Engineers, Minor Irrigation. The two PFCs would prepare tank projects for
appraisal according to criteria (paras 5.07-5.18) agreed between GOK and
IDA. In addition, two Quality Control Divisions under the supervision of SEs,
Design have been established to ensure appropriate standards in the construc-
tion of tank projects. Staffing of these divisions and cells will be completed
by March 31, 1981.
The Minor Irrigation Committee
6.04      Under the chairmanship of the Special Secretary, Irrigation, a
Minor Irrigation Committee (MIC) consisting of the Deputy Secretary, ID;
the Chief Engineers, Minor Irrigation; the Chief Engineer, Water Resource
Development Organization; the Director of the Karnataka Engineering Research
Station; the Director of the Department of Agriculture and experts from
the Indian Institute of Management, the Institute of Social Change and the
University of Agricultural Sciences would be established to be responsible
for appraising and supervising TIPs. The MIC would supervise the works of
a Special Appraisal and Supervision Circle (SASC) headed by a Superintendent
Engineer who would be also Secretary of the MIC. He would be supported by four
divisions: two Appraisal Divisions (AD), a Technical Monitoring and Evaluation
Division (TMED), and an Operational Monitoring and Evaluation Division (OMED).
The proposed organization of the MIC is shown in Annex 1, C-2.
6.05      The two ADs would be responsible for appraising the proposed TIPs.
Each of these two divisions will be staffed with one EE, three to four AEEs
and an Agriculturalist (Annex 1, C-2). The TMED would supervise TIPs
under implementation and would initiate technical review and evaluations of
the agreed criteria (assumptions on irrigation efficiencies, design of the
irrigation and drainage networks and construction methods). It would liaise
with the Institute of Engineering in Karnataka to incorporate results of
technical research into the implementation of TIPs. The OMED would monitor
the agro-economic aspects as well as O&M of TIPs under operation. In addition,
it would carry out surveys to assess the effectiveness of water allocation
procedures and the appropriateness of the recommended cropping patterns. In
cooperation with local agricultural authorities it would monitor the develop-
ment of crop yields under the project for operating TIPs and induce appropriate
measures to be taken in the case of adverse developments. It would also liaise
with other research and evaluation agencies in charge of overall evaluation of
the minor irrigation program. The staff of these two divisions will include
an Executive Engineer, 4-5 Assistant Engineers; an Agricultural Economist,
and 2 Statistical Officers (Annex 1, C-2).  The MIC and SASC have already been
established. Staffing for the latter will be completed by March 31, 1981.

Procedures for Processing of Tank Irrigation Projects 1/
6.06      Project Identification.  Potential sites for tank irrigation
projects (TIPs) below 1,000 ha would be identified by the existing 8 Minor
Irrigation Investigation Divisions. TIPs above 1,000 ha would be identified
by the existing 4 Major Irrigation Investment Division under the Water
Resources Development Organization. Preliminary reports will be submitted
to the concerned Chief Engineers (CEs). After consultation with concerned
District Offices, the CEs will approve full scale investigation and prepara-
tion of TIPs.
6.07      Project Preparation.  Hydrological, geological, topographical and
soil investigations would be carried out by the Irrigation Investigation
Divisions (Minor and Major). These divisions would also be responsible
for detailed designs of the reservoirs and the irrigation systems. The
two Project Formulation Cells, which would prepare projects for appraisal
according to criteria agreed between GOI, GOK and IDA, would be responsible
for producing Project Preparation Reports (Annex 5A). Each report would
include designs, agricultural plans, costs estimates and a tentative imple-
mentation plan. These reports would be cleared with GOK's concerned depart-
ments at the District level as well as at the State level. After clearance,
the projects would be submitted for appraisal.
6.08      Project Appraisal.  The two Appraisal Divisions of the Special
Appraisal and Supervision Circle (SASC) would be responsible for appraising
the proposed TIPs at the sites and ensure that the designs are technically
sound, the hydrology and geology as well as designs of large dams have been
reviewed by the Dam Safety Panel and its recommendations have been followed;
the proposed cropping patterns are suitable for the command area; design and
operation of the system have been discussed and agreed with farmers; arrange-
ments for strengthening of agricultural supporting services are adequate;
implementation schedules are realistic and the projects are economically
viable. The Appraisal Divisions would confirm and adjust cost estimates as
necessary and prepare Project Summaries (Annex 5B) to be submitted to the MIC.
6.09      Project Approval.  On the basis of information provided by the
Project Formulation Cells in the Project Preparation Report and by the
Appraisal Divisions in the Project Summary, the Minor Irrigation Committee
(MIC) would approve or disapprove the proposed TIPs. An assurance has been
obtained from GOK, that project summaries of approved projects and minutes
of all MIC meetings would be promptly furnished to IDA.
6.10      Project Supervision.  The following activities would be carried out:
(a) Annual Implementation Review. The Superintending Engineer (SE)
of the SASC would prepare an annual report to list TIPs under
preparation and implementation (Annex 5C). Special attention
would be given to budgetary allocations and staff availability
for each TIP in order to ensure that adequate funds would be
provided in accordance with implementation schedule.
1I/ For a graphic presentation of the project cycle, see Annex 1, C-3.



- 34 -
(b)  Annual Tank Performance Review.  The Superintending Engineer of
the SASC would also prepare an annual summary of the performance
of TIPs built under the project, including data on operation
and maintenance, on areas actually irrigated and on cropping
patterns (Annex 5D). Annual implementation programs and annual
performance summaries would be submitted to IDA by Ma-ch 31
of each year. An assurance to this effect has been obtained
from GOK.
(c)  Progress Review:  Technical Implementation.  The Technical Moni-
toring and Evaluation Division (TMED) would be responsible for
supervising TIPs under implementation. Because of the large
number of TIPs scattered throughout the State, field visits
to each one will not be possible. Consequently, TMED would
visit every TIP above 1,000 ha and above 25% of TIPs below
1,000 ha twice a year. It would submit to the MIC a supervi-
sion summary for each TIP visited to report the progress of
construction (as compared to planned implementation schedules),
change in costs, if any, compliance to agreed criteria and
procurement problems encountered during construction, if any
(Annex 5E). For the remaining 75% of TIPs below 1,000 ha,
the concerned implementing divisions would prepare progress
reports twice a year for submittal to the MIC.
(d)  Progress Review:  Operational Implementation.  The Operational
Monitoring and Evaluation Division (OMED) would be responsible
for supervising the agro-economic aspects as well as O&M of
TIPs under operation. The OMED would visit the same projects
as those for implementation review twice a year. It would
submit to the MIC a supervision summary for each TIP visited
to report irrigation benefits, adequacy of agricultural sup-
porting services as well as the quality and effectiveness of
operation and maintenance (Annex 5F). For the remaining 75%
of the TIPs below 1,000 ha, the concerned implementing divi-
sions would prepare progress reports twice a year for submit-
tal to the MIC.
IDA Involvement
6.11      An assurance has been obtained from GOK that the procedures set forth
in paras. 6.06-6.10 would be adopted. IDA's involvement would be to spotcheck
the decisions of the Minor Irrigation Committee on a selective basis. The MIC
would be required to submit to IDA minutes of MIC meetings and project sum-
maries of approved TIPs. IDA would select randomly at least two TIPs a year
to appraise in depth. In any case, if IDA disagrees with MIC's approvals of
certain TIPs, IDA would n.t disburse against expenditures claimed for those
TIPs.
6.12      IDA supervision missions would:  (i) assess the quality of the
appraisal divisions' works; (ii) spot-check in the field whether agreed
criteria have been followed; (iii) review procurement procedures; (iv) check
the financial reports kept by GOI and GOK; (v) assess whether the established



- 35 -
criteria continue to be appropriate; and (vi) examine the content and timeli-
ness of reports submitted by the SASC to the MIC and by MIC to IDA.
Farmers' Organization
6.13      In order to improve on overall tank operations, in a system designed
to higher standards of efficiency and operation, a Tank Irrigation Committee
would be formed for each new tank command area, immediately after a TIP has
been sanctioned for the respective location. The Committee would be heard and
consulted before finalization of detailed designs, so as to ensure a more
active participation of farmers in "their" tank development right from the
beginning and to integrate farmers' views of a proposed project into final
design. After construction, at least twice a year before each irrigation
season, local staff of the Irrigation Department would consult and agree with
the Committee on the details of scheduling water delivery for the coming season.
The Department would remain in charge of physical maintenance of the tank and
distribution/drainage system, but would share the responsibility for O&M with
the Committee. Each Committee would consist of an appropriate number of farmer
representatives, an agricultural officer and a junior engineer. The junior
engineer would be responsible for preparing schedules for water delivery
according to the decision of the Committee. The appropriate organizational
structure of the Committee and farmers' organization for water sharing would
be studied under the project (para. 5.26). Until such study is completed,
GOK would initiate the formation of a Tank Irrigation Committee on an experi-
mental basis for at least three TIPs. An assurance has been obtained to this
effect.
Maintenance of Tank Irrigation Projects
6.14      Until a decision on structure, functions and responsibilities of
Tank Irrigation Committees (TICs) is implemented (which would include a deci-
sion on sharing of the responsibility for as well as the physical execution
of the maintenance of distribution systems between farmers on one side and
the Irrigation Department (ID) on the other side), the ID would continue to
maintain the canals, structures and drainage networks of TIPs. Physical main-
tenance requirements would, however, be reduced considerably by lining of the
distribution systems. Maintenance of field channels would be carried out by
the farmers themselves and would be supervised by the ID's staff. Operation
and maintenance of dams and appurtenant structures would remain with the ID
irrespective of final arrangements for the sharing of responsibilities with
the TICs.
Cost Recovery
6.15      Capital and O&M Costs.  The per hectare investment cost for individual
tank projects varies with size and topographical conditions of a project. On
average, capital cost would amount to about Rs 21,300 per ha, including the
construction of tank, distribution and drainage system and on-farm works, land
acquisition, physical contingencies and overhead (para 5.04). Operation and
maintenance is assumed to cost about Rs 85 per ha annually. Thus, total
annualized cost, at 10% interest over 50 years, would be about Rs 2,230/ha.



- 36 -
6.15      Charges Related to Irrigation.  Prevailing water rates, last estab-
lished in January 1981, vary with crops from Rs 60/ha for most upland crops,
to Rs 128/ha for paddy, Rs 120/ha for cotton and Rs 560/ha for sugarcane.
On the average, a watercharge of about Rs 106/ha of CCA can be expected. Land
revenue differs for rainfed and irrigated land; the project would result in an
incremental revenue of Rs 24/ha. Other local taxes and cesses are calculated
as a 60% addition to land revenue. Considering all water related charges,
annual cost recovery would amount to about Rs 144/ha of CCA, or to about 6.5%
of annual capital and O&M cost.
6.17      Other Taxes.  Other taxes, which are at present easier to asses and
collect are given greater importance by the Government. In Karnataka, a tax
of 4% is levied on the sale of all agricultural products. Sales of fertili-
zers and agrochemicals also carry a tax of 2%, and sales of most certified
seeds are taxed by 4%. In addition, a 2% market fee is levied on all produce
sold through regulated markets, of which 0.8% is used for the operation of the
market while 1.2% is collected by the state. Sales taxes and market fees would
increase GOK's revenue by about Rs 380 per hectare brought under irrigation.
Together with water-related charges, tax revenue would increase to a total of
about Rs 524 per ha, covering all O&M cost and about 20% of annual capital
cost, under the prevailing system of watercharges and taxes. Income tax
payable on incomes exceeding a certain threshold, especially by medium and
large farmers, would also contribute to higher revenues, but this effect has
not been estimated.
6.18      Farmers' Ability to Pay.  Cost recovery has to be compared to what
farmers can reasonably be expected to afford to pay, considering their incre-
mental benefits from irrigation and the necessary incentives for them to
participate in this scheme. For this purpose, "project rent" has been cal-
culated as incremental net income per ha, less appropriate rewards to family
labor, entrepreneurship and allowance for cultivation risk (Annex 1, T-l1).
At full development, the estimated average project rent would amount to about
Rs 2,800 per ha. Direct recovery would thus result in a recovery/rent ratio of
5%. This leaves ample scope for increases in watercharges without reducing
incentives to use irrigation water.
6.19      Limits to Higher Charges.  Cost recovery with present levels of water
charges would be unsatisfactory under the proposed project, both with regard
to farmers' estimated potential ability to pay and to the percentage of total
cost recovered. Under the present system, a State-wide uniform rate is charged
(for a given crop on a per acre/per season basis) in all public irrigation
schemes because of administrative difficulties of assessing benefits individ-
ually for each farmer. Large variations in benefits do not only occur between
different farmers in the same command area (e.g., due to farm size, soil
quality and location within the scheme) but also between projects and between
different types of schemes (large and medium surface water schemes, tanks,
etc.). It can be observed in existing projects that the water supplied to
tail-end farmers is often unreliable--due to design and condition of the
distribution system--and that benefits to irrigators are fairly low. Thus,
water rates are set at a low level to give tail-end farmers sufficient incen-
tive to use the water, although the "average" farmer would be able to pay
substantially higher charges.  The same reasoning applies also to qualitative



- 37 -
differences between irrigation schemes and types of irrigation. Until it is
technically and administratively feasible to implement volumetric water charges,
which better reflect the benefits accruing to each farmer, water charges will
remain at an inherently low level.
6.20      Study of Modified System of Watercharges.  Under the proposed project,
design standards and operational criteria for water distribution aim at an
improved water supply, with essentially equitable and measurable quantities
to be delivered to all participating farmers on a rotational basis. This would
allow methods of charging for irrigation services more closely related to the
amount of water actually used by individual farmers (e.g., by recording the
time periods of actual flow to a holding). It would also facilitate an increase
in the overall level of water charges and their collection (for these new tank
irrigation schemes), since higher reliability of service and the link between
charges, volume of water received and benefits derived therefrom can be expected
to change farmers' attitudes towards payment for such service, particularly in
view of rather high expected benefits. As charging for irrigation services
is an important element in the relationship among farmers as well as between
the Irrigation Department and the farmers, the proposed study on Water Users'
Organization would include recommendations as to what methods of assessing,
administrating and collecting water charges within te envisaged organizational
framework would be suitable to promote equitable charging, efficiency of water
use and acceptable cost recovery, given the improved design and operation of
distribution systems. The recommendations of the study would also take into
account the political and legislative feasibility of special charging methods
and/or levels for irrigation schemes with improved design and operation.
6.21      On the basis of such recommendations, GOK would, by March 1984,
review the method and the level of changing for irrigation water supply in
new tank irrigation projects and would, after the consideration of IDA's com-
ments, introduce an appropriate system and leve of such charges, with the
objective of recovering the operation and maintenance cost of such tanks fully,
and the investment cost to the extent possible, given the need for incentives
to participating farmers and given their payment capacity. An assurance to
this effect has been obtained from GOK.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
General
7.01      Under the proposed project, 120-160 individual tanks would be built,
covering a command area of about 25,000 ha. About 60% of this area would be
located in dry and drought prone areas with less than 800 mm of mean annual
rainfall. The project would reduce some of the dependence of agriculture on



- 38 -
the vagaries of rainfall, reduce farmers' risks and their risk aversion, 1/
increase production of food and cash crops and provide farmers with higher and
more regular incomes and employment. Not only would new irrigation facilities
be provided, but simultaneously also higher standards of design and operation
would be introduced in these projects.  The independence of projects from
major sources of irrigation water permits their location in places where
otherwise no irrigation would be possible, thus helping to correct some of the
existing imbalance in irrigation development. The main benefits from the
project are summarized below:
Summary of Expected Benefits
Benefiting farm families                         7,500-8,500
Increase in net irrigated area                   25,000 ha
Increase in cropping intensity                   from 102% to 161%
Increase in foodgrain production                 63,000 t per year
Increase in cashcrop production                  Rs 105 M
Increase in per capita income                    300%
Increase in farm employment                      3 M mandays/year
Increase in value added                          Rs 109 M
Employment in construction during 5 years        35-40 M mandays
7.02      Production Benefits.  Annual production increases generated by the
project at full development (about 1990), are estimated at about 63,000 tons
of cereals and pulses, valued at Rs 69 M (+340% over "without project situa-
tion"), and Rs 105 M of cashcrops (+570%), mostly cotton, oilseeds, chillies,
sugarcane and mulberry. The incremental annual value added to the economy at
those production levels is estimated at about Rs 109 M per annum, not counting
induced value added in production of material inputs or in the processing
industries. An additional benefit, which is difficult to quantify, would be
generated in the form of fish production in new tanks. This is current
practice in most existing tanks and would be expected under new tanks also.
7.03      Employment Benefits.  Overall direct employment effects will largely
stem from the provision of irrigation in presently rainfed areas. Employment
on benefiting farms would increase from about 1.8 M mandays to about 4.7 M
mandays per year under the project, which is equivalent to the creation of
about 12,000-13,000 full time jobs. Most of this employment would occur in
the form of increased on-farm activities for family members, thereby reducing
the need to rely on uncertain and often remote work opportunities. Medium and
larger farmers would hire additional labor, mostly from underemployed rural
workers, at a rate of some 1.2 M mandays annually. It is estimated that con-
struction of tanks would provide, over a span of four to five years, between
35 M and 40 M mandays of employment for unskilled workers.
1/   Farmers would still be depending on annual variations in rainfall, since
the source of irrigation (the volume of water in the reservoir) is also
directly depending on rainfall. The risk reduction refers rather to
the bridging of dry spells during the rainy season in average and good
rainfall years, and to an assured water supply to those areas that
receive irrigation in the dry season in any given year (based on actual
reservoir levels before the start of the dry season).

Income and Poverty Impact
7.04      The project is directed towards farmers which are at present vir-
tually without any irrigation, more than 60% of them living in areas which
are considered moderately or severely droughtprone. Incomes under these
circumstances are near the subsistence level, which is reflected in estimated
farm budgets for some typical farm sizes without the project (Annex 1, T-ll).
Net family incomes (in cash and kind) in the dry and transitional zones vary
from Rs 1,800-2,200 for a marginal farm to Rs 7,000-11,000 per year for a
large farm. Taking into account family size on such farms, per capita incomes
vary roughly from Rs 400 to Rs 1,300 per year. In the high rainfall zones,
per capita income ranges from about Rs 600 to Rs 1,200 per year. 1/ Given an
estimated rural poverty income threshold of about Rs 780 per year and given
with the farm size distribution as illustrated in para 1.16, some 70% of farm
families likely to benefit from the project live presently under poverty con-
ditions. Projecting farm budgets for the future with project (Annex 1, T-11),
assuming average zonal cropping patterns and varying availability of family
labor, farm family incomes (including off-farm earnings) would increase to
about Rs 6,000 for a small farm, Rs 23,500 for a medium size farm and about
Rs 45,000 for a large farm, translating into average per capita incomes of
about Rs 1,300, Rs 3,700 and Rs 5,700, respectively. The incidence of project
benefits is likely to follow the present pattern of landholding size. It is
thus anticipated that absolute poverty would be almost eliminated among parti-
cipating families. Not much is known about income levels of rural landless
laborers in Karnataka, but a survey in the Tungabhadra command area revealed
that the number of days worked annually by landless workers increased from
about 130 to 230 as a result of irrigation. With the observed difference
in average wages for operations on rainfed and irrigated land (Rs 5 vs Rs 6.3),
incomes of landless laborers (who belong generally to the poorest of the poor),
are expected to increase at least two-fold in places affected by new tank
irrigation.
Assumptions for Economic Analysis (see Annex 7 for details)
7.05      For each agroclimatic zone, cropping pattern, crop yields and input
requirements were projected towards the expected year of full development
(1990), both for the "with project" and "without project" situation. Cropping
patterns for the "without project" situation are based on present rainfed
cropping practices; those under the project have been derived from observed
patterns under irrigation in each zone, taking into account agroclimatic
characteristics, farmers' preferences when switching from rainfed to irrigated
production, but also GOK's policy of promoting production of certain crops
(oilseeds, to a lesser extent pulses) and of restricting use of valuable water
for water-intensive crops, such as paddy and sugarcane in areas of low rainfall.
Cropping patterns so deri-ed do not represent necessarily an optimum choice in
the sense of maximizing 'eturns to water (the limiting factor), since such an
outcome could only be expected from strictly enforced, optimal water distribu-
tion practices. Thus, the share of paddy and sugarcane is always assumed to
1/   Only a small percentage of the farms in the high rainfall zones are
larger than 3 ha. Population density on the majority of farms is very
high, resulting in comparatively low per capita incomes.

be somewhat larger than advisable under the climatic conditions. Assumed
irrigation intensitiSs (average 145%) result in average water3requirements of
about 9,500-10,500 m /ha of CCA in dry3zones, 10,000-11,000 m /ha for transi-
tional zones and about 13,000-14,000 m /ha for high rainfall zones, reflecting
different conditions of likely supply. Crop yields for rainfed crops have been
assumed slightly higher than at present to take into account likely increases
over the next decade. Irrigated yields reflect the assessment of what would
be feasible with presently available varieties and average present cultivation
practices under irrigation. Cropping patterns, yields, inputs and crop budgets
for different agroclimatic zones are presented in Annex 1, T-13 and T-14.
7.06      Economic input and output prices were projected for 1990, in constant
1980 Rupees, according to standard Bank practice, i.e. they were derived from
projected world market prices after adjusting for transport, handling, pro-
cessing and quality differences. A standard conversion factor of 0.8 was
applied to domestic cost elements. Economic wages for unskilled farm labor
were estimated as about two thirds of financial wage rates. Reflecting an
observed wage differential, wages in irrigated agriculture are assumed to
be about 25% higher than in rainfed agriculture.
7.07      Project Cost was derived as a weighted average construction cost per
cubicmeter of water available in an average year at the reservoir outlet, the
weights being the expected shares of different tank 3size categoriSs (Annex 1,
T-3).  Such cost varies typica ly with size from Rs 1.50/m  to Rs 2.20/m ;
the average is about Rs 1.97/m . In order to take into account other project
related cost difficult to estimate on a unit basis (access roads, catchment
protection works, land shaping, etc.), this value has been increased by 15% to
Rs 2.26 per cubic meter. A construction conversion factor of 0.78 was applied
to this cost, reflecting the assumed shares of unskilled labor, non-traded
inputs and import content and their respective economic cost. Cost of opera-
tion and maintenance of a TIP was &ssumed as Rs 85/ha, multiplied by a conver-
sion factor of 0.7 to reflect a high content of unskilled labor. Creation of
a reservoir causes loss of agricultural production in the submerged area. On
the average, an area equivalent to about 15% of CCA is estimated to be sub-
merged; a loss of rainfed production of Rs 1,050/ha of CCA was assumed to
occur due to the project. 1/
7.08      Value of water and project benefits.  Cost-benefit analysis is based
on an evaluation of cost and returns to water (as the main benefit-producing
factor); thus the incremental net return per unit of water used (value of
water) has been calculated. 2/  It varies between agroclimatic zones from
1/   80% of average estimated economic net return of Rs 1,300/ha, since part
of the submerged area can be cultivated when tank is temporarily dry.
2/   Water requirements were calculated according to modified Penman method
and agreed criteria (para 5.11) for each agroclimatic zone, based on
estimated average rainfall (50% dependable) for the zone and projected
cropping patterns.

about Rs 0.50 tg Rs 0.60 per m  of water (at reservoir outlet), averaging
about Rs 0.55/m (Annex 1, T-15). The average over all zones virtually does
not change with varying assumptions on irrigation intensities; therefore,
project benefits depend only on the actual quantities of water made available
per ha of CCA. For the calculation of expected benefits, the release and use
of water as well as the incremental production were assumed to follow an ini-
tial build-up over five years (after completion of construction), reflecting
the gradual adoption and adjustment process of participating farmers.
Economic Rate of Return.
7.09      After distributing construction cost over an estimated average
implementation period of three years, and discounting costs and benefits of
water over 50 years, the economic rate of return is about 20%, as against an
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12% for India. This economic rate
of return reflects the viability of an average TIP. Estimated economic cost
and benefit streams for an average ha of command area are shown in Annex 1,
T-16.
Project Risk
7.10      Uncertainty of Average Reservoir Inflows. I/  Methods presently
used in Karnataka for estimation of annual inflow into a reservoir are based
on formulae which estimate runoff yield of a catchment on the basis of mean
seasonal rainfall in the catchment, given certain catchment characteristics.
Although the proposed project would improve the data base for runoff yield
estimates by actual streamflow measurements and a more accurate prediction
model, there will always be errors in prediction to varying degrees, which
cause a potential risk to a project's viability by reducing the benefits
(which depend essentially on the average volume of water available per ha of
command area) below their appraisal level.  However, since there are no
indications that the presently available methods are significantly biased
towards either under- or overestimation, the overall project outcome as an
average over many dispersed tank irrigation projects faces a diversified,
i.e., low risk, even with those less accurate runoff estimation methods.
7.11      The results from a study undertaken by GOK to test the reliability
of runoff estimates according to Strange's curves (Annex 6) by comparing
actual with estimated runoffs in 12 catchments in Karnataka indicates that
the actual inflow into a reservoir may be assumed to be not less than 65%
of the estimate with 90% probability. For the proposed project, a reduction
of average water supply by 35% relative to appraisal assumptions would still
result in an economic rate of return of about 14%.
1/   The uncertainty or risk referred to here is not related to year-to-year
variations in rainfall (see footnote to para 7.01), but to the long term
average water supply for an individual TIP and for all TIPs as an aggre-
gate. The evaluation of benefits is based on such long term average
supply; consequently, this risk affects the long term benefits from the
project.



- 42 -
7.12      An attempt was made to illustrate the consequences of under- and
overdesigning of a typical project relative to various levels of actual reser-
voir inflow. For this purpose, an approach based on decision analysis was
taken; for details on the assumptions and results see Annex 7. The results
indicate that better prediction methods achieve, of course, a reduction of the
(opportunity) cost of uncertainty, i.e. of risk, but do not necessarily lead
to different decisions on the optimum size of a project, unless the expected
benefit/cost ratio is low. 1/ If the problem were whether to delay a project
in order to collect more information and to reduce risk, or to go ahead based
on less reliable information, the decision should certainly be in favor of the
latter, since the expected cost of delay in terms of net benefits lost 2/
(about 30% of "appraisal NPV" for three years delay, at a 12% discount rate),
would always outweigh the benefits gained in terms of reduced opportunity
losses. In addition, the risks associated with imperfect methods of runoff
estimation do not seem more serious than those resulting from possible errors
in other parameters (rainfall, yields, prices, water requirements, project
cost). There is little chance of average water supply shortfalls being so
serious as to reduce the expected net present value to zero. However, the
introduction of improved methods of prediction and actual runoff measurements
at the tank site would reduce the expected cost of uncertainty considerably 3/
and would lead, on average, to better design decisions and economic returns
for later schemes under the project and thereafter.
7.13      Sensitivity to Basic Assumptions.  The project's economic viability
was tested for its sensitivity to deviations from basic values for key para-
meters, such as crop yields at full development, input costs, output prices,
water requirements, and cost of and delays in construction, etc. Correspond-
ing changes in the economic rate of return are tabulated below:
1/   "Optimum" size (as against a size based on deterministic design decisions)
is the project size with the highest expected net present value. Gener-
ally, the "optimum" size in this approach is slightly lower than the
appraisal size. (This is due to the fact that expected benefits increase
only slightly for project sizes larger than the appraisal size and reach
soon a maximum, while project cost varies approximately in proportion to
size.) For low B/C ratios, a more accurate prediction method would
result in appraisal sizes closer to the optimum size than less accurate
methods.
2/   A delay in construction would not affect the rate of return; it would,
however, change the NPV as estimated at present, i.e., at the time of
undelayed construction.
3/   The expected cost of uncertainty (also known as expected opportunity
loss, expected value of perfect information or simply expected risk), is
the difference between the expected net present value for the optimum
size under uncertainty and such value under certainty.

(i)  Conveyance efficiency                    - 20               17
Other parameters, such as particular values of conversion factors, economic
wages, O&M cost or loss of production due to submergence have no significant
effect on the sensitivity of the economic rate of return. Even combinations
of substantial changes of benefit and cost parameters would not be likely to
reduce the economic rate of return to 12%.
7.14      Switching Values.  The returns to and quantity of water and the
cost of construction play an important role in determining economic viability.
Therefore those values of these parameters have been examined (switching
values) which would, ceteris paribus, reduce the economic rate of return to
the estimated opportunity cost of capital. These values are estimated as
follows:
Value of water at the tank outlet
Basic assumption:       Rs 0.55/ 3
Switching value:        Rs 0.30/m  (-46%)
Supply of water from the tank
Basic assumption:       10,800 m3/ha/year
Switching value:         5,880 m /ha/year  (-46%)
Cost of construction per m  of releas-ble water:
Basic assumption:        Rs 2.26/mi
Switching value:        Rs 4.31/m3  (+91%)
Construction period
Basic assumption:        Average:  3 years
Switching value:        Average:  more than 10 years



- 44 -
A shortfall of 46% in the incremental net returns per cubic meter of water or
in the supply of water per ha of CCA and a 90% overrun in construction cost
are not considered likely. The average construction period is not likely to
more than double relative to basic estimate, since most sub-projects would
be relatively small and GOK's capability of implementing a relatively modest
program of construction of about 120-160 tanks is not questioned.
7.15      The proposed project faces the risks normally associated with
irrigation projects, the overall risk being widely diversified over a large
number of individual projects. The risk is considered acceptable; the project
would be economically viable.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Agreements have been reached with GOI during negotiations that the
proceeds of the credit would be channeled to GOK in accordance with GOI's
standard arrangements for development assistance to the States of India
(para. 5.26).
8.02      Agreements have been reached with GOK during negotiations on the
following points:
(a)  Tank Irrigation Projects (TIPs) would be planned, designed,
approved, implemented and operated according to the agreed
criteria (para. 5.06);
(b)  (i) GOK would maintain its panel of experts with qualifications,
experience and terms of reference (Annex 4) acceptable to GOK
and IDA to review the plans and designs of all dams, including
their related structures constructed under the Project, whose
proposed height of the embankment above streambed exceeds
10 m, Phose proposed gross storage behind embankment exceeds
2.5 Mm at full reservoir level, or whose proposed location
of the embankment is such that significant destruction could
occur in case of failure; (ii) it would cause the panel to
conduct periodic reviews during the design and construction
to examine whether any new grounds for making changes in the
design of the such dams have become apparent (para 5.24).
(iii) GOK would cause the dams mentioned above to be period-
ically inspected in accordance with sound engineering practice
in order to determine whether there are any deficiencies in the
condition of such structures, or in the quality and adequacy
of maintenance or methods of operations of the same, which
may endanger their safety.



- 45 -
(c) A study would be completed by March 31, 1983 according to
terms of reference agreed between GOK and IDA (Annex 3) with
the purpose: (i) to investigate whether the formation of
water users' organizations would contribute to an increase
of the farmers' participation in the operation of the TIPs;
(ii) to recommend means for establishing viable and effective
participation of beneficiaries in operation and maintenance
of the TIPs; and (iii) to recommend a system of water
charges in accordance with objectives agreed with the
Association (para 5.30).
(d) GOK would promptly provide funds from its development budget
to execute the project in accordance with the schedule of
expenditures set forth in Annex 1, T-9 (para. 5.32);
(e) (i) GOK would maintain separate accounts on project expen-
ditures; (ii) it would ensure that these accounts are audited
annually by the State Accountant General or his designate
and that the resulting reports would be submitted to IDA as
soon as possible but not later than nine months after the
end of each fiscal year; (iii) it would make complete
accounts and financial statements available for inspection
during IDA review mission (para 5.35);
(f) GOK would promptly furnish to IDA Project Summaries (see
Annex 5B) for each TIP approved by the Minor Irrigation
Committee (MIC) as well as minutes of each MIC meeting
(para 6.10);
(g) GOK would submit to IDA by March 31 of each year an
Annual Implementation Program (see Annex 5C) and an
Annual Performance Summary (see Annex 5D), (para 6.10);
(h) individual tank irrigation projects would be processed
according to agreed procedures (para 6.11);
(i) GOK would initiate, on an experimental basis, the formation
of a Tank Irrigation Committee in each of at least three
selected TIPs. Committees would be formed before start of
constrution, in accordance with TOR and with a composition
to be agreed with IDA (para 6.13); and
(j) With the objective of ensuring recovery of annual operational
and maintenance costs and, to the extent possible, cost of
infrastructure investments, having consideration to incentives
for, and payment capacity of, farmers, GOK would (i) consider-
ing the recommendations of the study specified under (c) above,
by March 31, 1984, review the method of charging for irrigation
water supply as well as the level of water and water related
charges in tank irrigation projects in Karnataka, and (ii) as
soon as feasible thereafter, introduce and enforce an appro-
priate system and level of such charges after paying due
consideration to IDA's comments, if any, on the above
mentioned review and the study (para 6.21).



- 46 -
8.03      With the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project would
be suitable for an IDA credit of US$54 M on standard IDA terms. The Borrower
would be the Government of India.

1/  In constant 1975/76 prices.  The year 1975//6 represents actually an average
of the years 1974/75 to 1976/77, the last year for which complete production
data are available.
2/  Fertilizer use alone would explain about 35% ot the overall increase of
Rs 4,380 M, when assuming a production increase of Rs 8 due to 1 kg of nutrient.
However, a distribution of this effect among irrigated and rainfed agriculture,
new and existing areas has not been attempted.

KARNATAKA TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT
Criteria for Tank Irrigation Projects
Proposed for IDA Assistance
Planning Criteria
1.        Topographical Survey.  Each proposed command area should be sur-
veyed and a topographical map should be prepared at a scale of about
1:4,000 (16 inches to 1 mile) with contours not exceeding 0.3 m (1 foot).
The map should also show cadastral information and the boundaries of the
proposed system.
2.        Soil Survey and Land Classification.  A simple reconnaissance
type soil survey and land classification should be carried out in each
command area. The purpose of the classification should be to: (i) dif-
ferentiate between areas suitable for upland and lowland crops that re-
quire different irrigation practices; (ii) help predict the probable
future cropping patterns in the command; and (iii) identify soil defi-
ciencies, if any, for improved cultural practices. For this purpose, the
area should be classified into the following three categories: (i) R-
areas suitable for paddy; (ii) D-areas where a diversified cropping pattern
of both paddy and upland crops is possible; and (iii) U-areas suitable for
upland crops only. The R-areas would be relatively level, moderately well
drained with estimated percolation rates below 3 mm/day. Normally, mont-
morillonitic clay soils ("black cotton soils") would, in spite of their
low percolation rates, not be included in this category. However, all
areas where rainfed paddy is grown at present would be classified in the
R-category. The D-areas would have higher percolation rates (3-6 mm/day)
and slopes up to 1.5%. The U-areas would have percolation rates exceeding
6 mm/day and/or slopes extending 1.5%.
Hydrology
3.   (a)  Runoff Estimates.  Actual stream flows observed at a tank site
together with corresponding rainfall data over a period of at
least three years should be used wherever available to determine
mean (or 50% dependable) annual runoff from a catchment.I' The
same method should be used for the monthly distribution of run-
off. For those tank irrigation projects (TIPs) where such
records either are not yet or will not be available (e.g., for
small projects or during the first two years of the construction
1/ A long-term stream gauging program would be started in combination with
an improved and extended rainfall data collection network in order to
obtain better runoff yield estimates. This is expected to be applicable
to TIPs under this proposed project after the initial years.



-78-
ANNEX 2
Page 2
program), runoff estimates should either be based on a corre-
lation of rainfall and runoff observed at nearby catchments
with similar characteristics or on the use of Strange's tables
after classification of the catchment as "good," "average" or
"bad." Special care should be taken in the classification of
the catchment, and any "good" classification should be justi-
fied by a detailed comparison of the catchment with similar
catchments for which actual rainfall/runoff correlations are
available. (Annex 6 discusses the derivation and use of
Strange's tables in more detail.) As soon as the improved run-
off estimation model (Annex 6), based on continuous water
balance calculations, is fully developed and adapted for use
in Karnataka, it would replace the above-mentioned approaches
for determining runoff yield in ungauged or poorly gauged catch-
ments.
(b) For ungauged catchments, the monthly distribution of runoff
should be derived from nearby tanks or stream gauging stations
as above, or by using Strange's cumulative rainfall/runoff
relationships as discussed in Annex 6.
(c) Rainfall Data. Rain gauges should be installed in the catchment
of tanks serving more than 150 ha and daily rainfall records
should be maintained. Tanks with a command area of 1,000 ha
or more should have self-recording gauges. For tanks serving
less than 200 ha, the nearest existing rain gauge could be
used. At least three years of records inside the catchment
should be available for correlations with nearby gauge(s) for
which long-term records are available.- The adjusted mean
rainfall for the catchment would be used in the calculation of
runoff. (The purpose of this correlation is to ensure that the
catchment is not located in a rainshadow area.)
(d) In establishing the hydrology for a TIP, the intercepted runoff
upstream in a catchment should be excluded. However, a 25% re-
turn flow can be assumed from any existing upstream irrigation
project.
(e) The impact of the proposed TIP on the nearest downstream project
should be carefully assessed. In establishing the net impact on
the downstream project, a 25% return flow can be assumed from
the TIP. If the calculations indicate that the construction of
1/ For projects approved during the first and second year of the credit, a
one-year and a two-year record would be acceptable. However, the rain
gauging would be continued during construction and the hydrology and the
water balance of the TIPs would be reviewed before commissioning.



-79-
ANNEX 2
Page 3
the proposed TIP would result in a shortfall of water exceeding
5% of the design yield of the downstream project, the proposed
TIP must be submitted to IDA for approval.1/
(f)  For TIPs serving more than 1,000 ha, sediment samples should be
taken at or near each tank site for the determination of ex-
pected sediment levels in the reservoir. In the absence of
actual measurements, an estimate could be based on an assumed
silt load of 75 acre-feet per 100 sq mi of catchment. Sediment
ranges would be established for all tanks with command areas ex-
ceeding 1,000 ha so that accurate measurements of silt can be
made in the future.
4.        Catchment Protection Plan.  To avoid erosion and silting of the
tanks, the need for catchment protection works should be assessed and an
action program drawn up. The catchment assessment should, inter alia, be
based on: (i) slope classification map; (ii) soil and land capability
map; (iii) erosion map; and (iv) vegetative cover map. Based on the re-
sults of the surveys, appropriate measures should be outlined and included
in the project proposal. Depending on the nature and extent of the problem,
the action plan might include check dams, afforestation, bunding and ter-
racing. These special soil conservation measures would be part of the
project and eligible for reimbursement from the credit.
Cropping Patterns
5.        A general guideline for cropping patterns has been prepared by
GOI's PPM Cell for each agro-climatic zone. These guidelines should be
modified for each project to take into account the soil survey results
and the existing cropping patterns in the area. In this respect, it is
most important that the likely area under paddy is not underestimated.  As
a minimum, it should be assumed that all lands classified in the "R" cate-
gory would be under paddy during the main crop season. If the zonal
cropping pattern guide assumes a higher percentage of the area under paddy,
this higher figure should be adopted for the designing of the irrigation
system.
Water Requirements
6.   (a)  The modified Penman method2/ should be used to estimate crop water
requirements. In applying this method, the monthly evapotranspi-
ration (Eto) could be taken from the zone-wise Eto estimates pre-
pared by GOI's PPM Cell.
1/ In this case, GOK should submit the project reports for both the proposed
TIP and the existing project to IDA together with GOI's appraisal summary
for the proposed TIP and a separate note on hydrology.
2/ See FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24.



-80-
ANNEX 2
Page 4
(b) Effective rain should be taken as 50% of the 50% dependable
rainfall during the monsoon season and as 65% of the 50% de-
pendable rainfall during the nonmonsoon season. In calculating
the dependable rainfall, long-term records from a station in or
near the command area should be used.
(c) Irrigation requirements for paddy should include allowance for
land preparation (200-250 mm), deep percolation (2-4 mm/day),
and for maintaining a water depth of about 50 mm (this would be
drained at the end of the season).
(d) A preplanting irrigation (50-75 mm) should be scheduled for up-
land kharif crops, and, where necessary due to late planting
dates, for rabi crops.
(e) At this stage of development, the assumed field irrigation effi-
ciencies should not exceed 90% for paddy and 70% for diversified
(upland) crops.
(f) For planning purposes, the assumed conveyance efficiency should
not exceed 85%.
(g) A monthly tank operation study for the design year should be
carried out. Evaporation should be based on the average monthly
storage and.the area-capacity curve for the reservoir.
Design Criteria
7.        Distribution System:
(a) The Irrigation Department (ID) would lay out design and construct
the canal and field channel system down to each individual holding.
If the holdings are less than 1 ha, the water would be supplied
to 1 ha.
(b) The head capacity of the supply channels should be calculated with
the formula: q =(0.7 + 0.5 x p) x CCA
where q = head capacity in liter per second (l/s)
p = portion of the area under paddy
CCA = Cultivable Command Area in ha.
This implies that a system serving only upland crops would have
a capacity of 0.7 1/s/ha and a system serving only paddy would
have 1.2 1/s/ha.
(c) The distribution system should be designed to permit rota-
tional supply. Small tank systems (200 ha or less) should be
designed for daylight irrigation only.



-81-
ANNEX 2
Page 5
(d)  The conveyance and distribution system should be lined down to
turn-outs serving approximately 8 ha areas. Field channels
should be lined only to such extent that the distance between
the furthest field and a lined channel does not exceed 300 m.
(e) In areas with sandy (permeable) soils and/or areas with slopes
exceeding 2%, the head reach of the field channels (below 8
ha outlets) should be lined so that the distance between a
lined channel and the furthest field does not exceed 100 m.
(f) Both the outlets from the main supply channel and the turn-outs
serving 8 ha blocks should be gated.
(g) In all areas, the field channel system would be provided with
adequate structures, especially drop structures.
(h) Measuring devices should be provided at the head of the main
supply channel, at each off-taking channel, and at each 1 cusec
outlet.
(i) The main supply channels should be designed to permit full dis-
charges at off-take points when the main channel is flowing at
less than 50% capacity. Appropriate cross-regulators should
be provided for this purpose.
8.        Drainage:
(a) Adequate cross drainage works should be designed and built along
the main supply channels. In designing the cross drainage works,
special attention should be given to rainfall runoff from small
catchments uphill of the main supply channels.
(b) The ID should design and construct a drainage system (field and
main drains) in the command area. The capacity of the drainage
system should be sufficient to take care of a runoff of 3 1/s/ha.
Special attention should be given to the prevention of water
logging in the bottom lands close to the natural river channel
(Nalla).
9.        Communication System:
(a) An all-weather access road should be provided to all tanks.
(b) An all-weather service road should be provided along channels
with a capacity over 10 cusecs. An all-weather motorcycle/
bicycle path should be provided along all main supply channels
and distributary channels with a capacity between 10 cusecs and
1 cusec.



-82-
ANNEX 2
Page 6
10.        Agricultural Supporting Services
As a necessary condition for the successful development of the
project, adequate provision should be made for the supply of
extension services, inputs and marketing of products. The
PPM Cell, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture
and other concerned departments, would be responsible for in-
cluding in the project preparation report an analysis of the
present credit arrangements in the command area and the pro-
posed arrangements for the future. Surveys of other input re-
quirements (seed, fertilizer, pesticides, etc.) and the ade-
quacy of marketing and processing facilities should also be
made and future requirements identified. In addition, the
adequacy of supporting services, including extension, demonstra-
tion farms and research facilities should be examined, and pro-
posals made for catering to the needs of the project area.
11.        Dams, Embankments and Appurtenant Structures
Responsibility for the review of design and for quality control
of larger dams, embankments and apportionment structures would
rest with the Dam Review Panel. Exercise of their control should
be through timely review of designs prior to project construction.
The panel would assess the technical adequacy of the design based
on the present state of engineering practice and would recommend
modifications consistent with the utility and safety of each
structure. Following required modifications, the panel would
approve initiation of construction. Available GOI, State and
internationally recognized design and safety criteria and
standards should be observed as far as applicable. In addition
to empirical formulae (e.g., Ryve's) and unit hydrographs, the
improved system for runoff yield estimation should be used for
an estimate of peak runoff, as soon as this system is available.
Implementation Criteria
12.        Construction Practices:
(a)  Canal embankments and earthfill around structures should be
thoroughly compacted. Furthermore, where the canal invert is
in fill, the invert should be compacted. Mechanical compac-
tion equipment should be employed-1/
(b)  To ensure proper settlement of foundation in minor channels,
the sections should be thoroughly saturated by poanding or e%-
posing to one season of monsoon rains before lining operations
are undertaken.
1/ If mechanical compaction due to lack of space is not possible, pneumatic
rammers should be used.



-83-
ANNEX 2
Page 7
(c) All applicable GOI standards and practices should be followed
in construction of small dams or embankments and appurtenant
structures. These standards and practices should be adapted to
the utilization of local materials and to site conditions.
13.        Implementation Scheduling:
(a) The planning construction period for TIPs should not exceed:
Size of TIP                     Construction Period
Less than 400 ha                      2 years
400 ha - 1,000 ha                     3 years
Over 1,000 ha                         4 years
In addition to this construction period, preliminary works
(such as approach roads) should not exceed one year.
(b) Larger TIPs would be completed and commissioned on a block-by-
block basis. Each commissioning block should be not more than
about 400 ha.
(c) Water should not be released until all field channels have been
completed and the project, or a section of the project, has been
commissioned.
(d) The lining should be tested through ponding tests before commis-
sioning. If the seepage losses in any section of the channels
exceed 3 cusecs/H sq ft., the lining should be rectified.
(e) As part of the commissioning, the system should be tested to en-
sure that irrigation water can reach all parts of the CCA.
14.        Cost Estimates:
(a) Cost estimates would be based on current departmental rates or
on bid prices prevailing in the project area at the time of
appraisal.
(b) Cost estimates would include a physical contingency of 10% for
works for which detailed designs are available and 20% for all
other works, and no less than 15% for administration, design
and supervision. Price contingencies should be calculated in
accordance with the following table:
Years of Construction        Percent of Base Cost
2                           14%
3                           18%
4                           22%



-84-
ANNEX 2
Page 8
(c) Cost estimates would include land acquisition, resettlement of
families displaced by the project, approach and service roads.
15.        Operation Criteria:
(a)  Water-flows from outlets/turn-outs to each field channel should
normally be about 1 cusec but not less than 0.5 cusec.
(b) Release of water to farmers should follow initially a fixed
schedule prepared for each season.
(c) Irrigation releases for upland crops should be rotated every
10 days.
(d) A Tank Irrigation Committee should be formed immediately after
construction of a tank has been sanctioned. It would be con-
sulted by the Irrigation Department before finalizing of design
of the project and would be in charge of water scheduling, jointly
with the Department.
(e) The Government would be responsible for maintenance of the system
above the irrigation outlets. The Tank Irrigation Committee
should share with the Irrigation Department the responsibility
for operation and possibly maintenance of the system.
(f) The details of the organization of the Committee and the ways in
which responsibility should be shared would be decided after the
Study of Water Users Organization has been completed. For the
time being, GOK would, on an experimental basis, initiate forma-
tion of such committees in at least three selected new tank areas.
16.        Economic Criteria:
(a) Individual TIPs would have a rate of return exceeding 12% based
on estimated annual costs and benefits, discounted over 50 years.
(b) A TIP would meet this requirement if estimated undiscounted total
investment cost, divided by the amount of water (in cubic meters)
expected to be available in the design year for distribution at
the reservoir outlet, does not exceed a critical limit as set
forth by IDA for the agro-climatic zones (see Appendix). These
limits should be increased annually by the estimated rate of
inflation applicable to civil works.
(c) Total investment cost would comprise all projected related cost
(i.e., for construction, land aquisition, access roads, resettle-
ment, land development and catchment protection works, if any,
etc.) including physical contingencies. Price contingencies
would not be included, since the critical cost limits are based
on constant prices.



-85-
ANNEX 2
Page 9
(d)  In cases where a proposed TIP does not meet the economic cri-
terion mentioned in (b), and where GOK deems such a project
nevertheless justifiable, GOK would submit documentation on
such a project to IDA for approval, together with documentation
and arguments why the project is deemed justified.

KARNATAKA TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT
Terms of Reference for a Study on Increased
Farmers' Participation in Tank Irrigation Projects
There are currently some 25,000 tank irrigation schemes in Karnataka
operated and maintained by the State's Irrigation Department. Present opera-
tion practices are not geared to efficient water utilization. Greater parti-
cipation on the part of farmers in managing the operations and maintenance
(O&M) of these projects could enhance better water use and possibly reduce
Government staffing in new projects. Experience with farmers' organizations
for irrigation, however, has generally not been encouraging in India or in
most of Asia. A study is therefore proposed to examine the potential for
and proposed approaches toward achieving greater farmer participation in
O&M of new tank irrigation projects. Specific issues to be addressed by
the study would include the following:
1.        An evaluation of social, cultural and organizational features of
Karnataka farm families which bear on their willingness and potential effec-
tiveness to assist in O&M of tank projects. In this regard the study would:
- examine farm families in different agro-climatic zones
within the State;
- consider the difference in behaviour of farmers dependent
only on rainfall and those cultivating under tank irrigation;
-  consider differences between farmers growing mainly paddy
and those used to upland crops;
- consider differences between farmer's practices where farms
are located in the headreach of the network and those
located at the tailend;
- evaluate relationships between farmers as irrigators and the
system authorities, as well as among farmers themselves;
- examine farmers' awareness of advantages and disadvantages
of different operational alternatives;
- examine the role of other institutions in village life
which affect farmers' willingness to participate in joint
endeavours;
- consider the effects of caste and/or religion; and
- assess the role of leadership in farmer participation.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
-87-
2.        Conduct one or more case studies in each of the ten agro-climatic
zones of the State to find feasible levels of farmer participation in opera-
tion and maintenance. Case studies should cover tank schemes with different
levels of design standards and should specifically:
- assess the impact of function, features and condition of
the physical system (dam, canals, structures, outlets,
etc.) on farmer participation;
- include one or more case studies from parts of a river
valley project if the results can be related to tanks;
- examine the role of communication among farmers and between
them and higher authorities in achieving farmer partici-
pation;
- assess the degree of formality in farmer organizations
needed for their effective participation in system
management; and
- identify the specific components of tank operations and
management in which farmers should or should not be
trained to participate.
3.        Determine forms and levels of incentives required to induce sustained
farmer participation. Specifically, but not limited to these, consider:
- status through committee membership;
- incentives in the form of guaranteed "water rights," e.g.
predictable and measured water supply throughout the season;
- possible modification of legal status covering water use;
- possible participation of farmers' organization in administration
of water charges; and
- estimated costs of the recommended incentives, if any, and by
whom borne.
4.        Advise on possible changes in the system of charges for irrigation
service in new tank irrigation schemes, i.e. under improved standards of
design and operation of the physical water distribution system, in view of
proposed organizational arrangements and of modified modes of operation (e.g.
measured rotational water supply guaranteed to all participants). For this
purpose take into account, inter alia,
- the objectives of equitable charging for irrigation services
(commensurate with level of service received) and of efficient
use of scarce water supply;



ANNEX 3
Page 3
-88-
- the need for effective, voluntary participation in productive
water use within the proposed organizational framework;
- farmers' non-monetary contributions, e.g. for maintenance
works;
- feasible levels of charging in view of determinants of
farmers' varying ability to pay (e.g. incremental total
income and cash income, cultivation risk, reliability of
service, size of holding, etc.)
- legal implications of changes in the basis for and the system
of water charges; and
- political feasibility of such changes.
5.        Determine an appropriate role for Government agencies (Irriga-
tion Department primarily, but also Agriculture Department and others) in
relating to farmer organization, with explicit consideration of the Irri-
gation Department providing:
- monitoring of O&M for each tank;
- advisory or technical services to the system;
- participation with farmers on a tank committee;
- limited power in resolving conflicts within a tank
command;
- mediation between farmers' organizations from two or
more tanks; and
- training of farmers.
6.        Develop a systematic plan or applied methodology of implementation
by which recommended levels of farmer participation could be introduced in
new tanks.
7.        Provide a probability estimate of success in inducing sustained
farmer participation along the lines recommended.

INDIA
KARNATAKA TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT
Empirical Formulae and Improved Methods of Estimating
Runoff Yields in Karnataka
1.        Estimating runoff from watersheds has in the past been done
by using various formulae linking runoff with precipitation and by taking
into consideration the topographical and vegetative characteristics of the
catchments. Most commonly used in southern India are Strange's and Binnie's
tables and the Inglis-Ghat formula. Over the years various attempts have
been made to check on their accuracy. In the case of the Karnataka catchments,
hydrologists principally use the Stranges tables by categorizing runoff in
the individual catchments "good", "average", or "bad". Available data
relating rainfall, measured runoff and Strange's computed runoff coefficients
are summarized and compared in Table 1 for twelve locations spread through-
out the State. The data has been taken from a recent GOK paper entitled
"A Note on Hydrological Studies in Karnataka".
2.        Binnie derived his curve in 1890 by observing a number of small
catchments in Madhya Pradesh. Some two years later Strange developed his
curves using data observed in irrigation tanks in South India. These curves
reflect the type and size of catchment to which they relate. For example,
Binnie based his curves on catchments (less than 7 square miles) which were
nearly impermeable, whereas Strange's work is more suitable for South Indian
conditions. The critical weakness of the Strange and Binnie approaches is
that the rainfall-runoff curves do not reflect different incidences of rain-
fall; that is, the same total monsoon rainfall does not necessarily produce
the same runoff. Strange's coefficients are tabulated in the "Hydrological
Atlas of Madhya Pradesh, Volume I, 1973" for up to 60 inches of annual rain-
fall for good, average and bad runoff conditions. The relationship between
these conditions is given by a ratio of 2:1.5:1, respectively; thus, estimates
of runoff will vary significantly depending on catchment classifications.
However, the estimated value of yields based on Strange's tables depends
primarly on the duration and accuracy of the rainfall data used in deriving
the average annual rainfall for each catchment.
3.        The above mentioned study by GOK attempted to relate measured
monsoon rainfall and runoff for various catchments within the State to
Strange's catchment runoff classifications in order to improve identification
of catchments being considered for development of tank irrigation projects.
In the GOK's preparation reports for the nine individual tank projects, the
estimated annual runoff was based on the 50 or 75 percent dependable monsoon
rainfall. The runoff distribution for the months in question was based on
the observed monthly rainfall data for each catchment. None of the proposed



-107-
ANNEX 6
Page 2
locations for nine tank projects reviewed had streamflow gauges working over
a sufficient time span.l/ Also, very few rain gauge sites were located in
the project catchments. Because of this lack of geographically applicable
rainfall data, some catchments might produce considerably smr-aller runoff
yields than estimated due to local rain shadow effects. A program is
described in the main report which will firm up the data base for the
selection and development of future tank irrigation projects.
4.        Table 1 compares measured runoff values in twelve catchments with
the theoretical runoff computed by use of Strange's "average" coefficients
for each catchments. Values for measured runoff compare quite well with
values obtained using Strange's "average" runoff coefficients. The absolute
and relative variation of the measured runoff with computed runoff in each
catchment using Strange's "average" condition is tabulated. Absolute yield
deviations vary between +6 and -3 inches, deviations of the runoff coeffi-
cients vary between +12 and -9 percentage points. The relative standard
deviation of actual from computed yield is estimated by 27.4%. In summary,
although Strange's estimates may result in considerable error in specific
cases, on the average its performance appears to be satisfactory. Graph 1
shows curves for Binnie's as well as Strange's good, average and bad runoff
coefficients. For annual rainfall of up to 60 inches, most runoff values
for the empirical estimates fall below the 40 percent coefficient level,2/
especially for the Strange's average and bad runoff conditions. Additional
improvement over the standard deviation of error may be expected by using
a rational case-by-case field choice of good, average or bad coefficients
to fit the type of catchment under consideration.
5.        The Inglis-Ghat Formula has been employed for determining annual
rainfall runoff-relationships for Karnataka Tank Irrigation Projects where
average annual rainfall exceeds 60 inches. Studies justifying its use were
not examined; however, very few tank projects are expected in the coastal
zone where rainfall would typically exceed 60 inches. Also, in cases where
tanks are planned in high rainfall areas, the surface water supply is
usually not the limiting factor; rather, storage sites and costs, especially
those related to peak runoff (spillway capacity, etc.), would control selection.
6.        If no measured rainfall-runoff correlations are available and the
Strange tables are the only way to estimate runoff, they should be used only
with the understanding that the tables indicate the relationship between
cumulative monthly rainfall, starting at the beginning of the season, and
cumulative runoff, i.e., a "double-mass" relationship. Thereby, the method used
of obtaining annual runoff by the one-step use of Strange's rainfall runoff-

at calibrated cros3-sections.
2/ Wide experience in the South Asia monsoon areas indicate that runoff from
catchments having other than near saturated antecedent conditions seldom
produce runoff in excess of 40 percent.

coefficients and the subsequent distribution of annual values according to
monthly rainfall patterns in the area may be improved upon by obtaining
monthly runoff increments from cumulative runoff estimates. This will pro-
vide the required monthly values for use in the project water supply and
operations evaluations but will not fully eliminate previously mentioned
errors which are inherent in Strange's empirical estimates. Strange's
original computation concept is formally discussed in the publication
"Methods of Hydrological Forecasting for the Utilization of Water Demands,"
Water Resources Series No. 27, United Nations, 1964.
Continuous Water Balance Models
7.        There is a need to improve the accuracy of present methodologies
for determining runoff in small catchments. The proposed improvement of
the state-wide rainfall data collection network and long-term stream
gauging program would be started in order to refine the hydrological data
base for TIPs. It will be possible to obtain some improvement in water
supply estimates by improving methodologies using the present data base.
In recent years, with greater availability of computers and calculators,
continuous water balance methods have been used. The water balance method
eliminates the major source of error in historically used formulae or co-
axial correlation techniques by accounting for the sequence of precipita-
tion in time. Thus, in a year when rainfall is more concentrated and
occurs at higher intensities more runoff is produced than a year when the
rainfall sequence is normal. In water balai4ce calculations, years with
the same total annual rainfall do not necessarily produce the same runoff.
Continuous water balance analyses have been used very successfully for
irrigation and water supply projects in Algeria, Indonesia, Ghana, Domini-
can Republic, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia and Iran. Water balance techniques
were recently accepted as a basis for a decision on annual water yields by
the United States Supreme Court, and have become widely used for flow fore-
casting in the United States. These methods should also prove useful in
Karnataka.
8.        Prior to 1950, hydrologists developed and used formulae, graphi-
cal techniques and combined graphical-mathematical methods such as coaxial
correlation techniques to relate annual runoff to annual precipitation and
other catchment characteristics. These techniques include the use of
Binnies, Inglis-Ghat and Strange's formulae, tables and graphs as presently
employed by the GOK. They do not properly account for the time sequence
or incidence of precipitation and evapotranspiration in the catchment.
These conditions together with the soil properties of the catchment are
factors determining runoff.
9.        In the early 1960's programmable digital computers made it possible
to simulate continuous water balance processes of rainfall and runoff. Hy-
drologic techniques such as the well-known Stanford Watershed Model using
daily and hourly tainfall. and evapotranspiration to ca'lculate aaiLy soil
moisture and runoff have resulted. This and other conceptually similar con-
tinuous water balance models presently employ programmable hand held calcu-
lators, desk-top and floor type computers. All give excellent runoff yield

and related hydrological estimates over a range of catchment variables.
Such variables include the following: annual rainfall and its sequential
distribution throughout the year; potential evapotranspiration and related
time sequence; soil properties such as moisture storage and permeability;
vegetation; topography and land slope; drainage characteristics; and,
pond, lake, and reservoir areas. Continuous water balance models are
based on the interrelated physical processes that occur in the catchment
between the parameters listed above. Rainfall and potential evapotran-
spiration inputs would be estimated or obtained for each catchment so as
to reflect local climatic conditions in the water balance model in terms
of time sequence and quantity.
Experience with a Continuous Water Balance Model in India
10.       A particular existing continuous water balance model, the "HBV-
Model" developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute
(SMHI), was adapted for and tested in the Upper Narmada River Basin of
Madhya Pradesh in collaboration between the Indian Institute of Technology
(IIT), New Delhi and the SMHI. The purpose was to verify the model's
potential under Indian Monsoon conditions.l/ Data were provided by IIT
and the model calibration was carried out by SMHI staff. Test runs were
also made on a few smaller catchments in the Betwa River Basin as part of
a UNDP training program at the SMHI (results not yet published).
11.       The HBV-model is a conceptual model for estimating runoff through
continuous water balance calculations. Input data include daily (longer
or shorter time periods may be used) precipitation observations and poten-
tial evapotranspiration estimates. The evaporation values used are nor-
mally monthly averages. (Air temperature data are also used for catchments
in northern climates for snow accumulation and ablation calculations only
but have been omitted under Indian conditions.) The model consists of sub-
routines for snow-accumulation and melt, a soil moisture accounting pro-
cedure, routines for runoff generation and groundwater recharge, and
finally a simple routing procedure. An advanced version provides options
for geographical zoning and different vegetation covers.
12.       The principal conclusion from the application of the HBV-model to
the Upper Narmada River Basin is that the model has potential for runoff
simulation and hydrological forecasting in India. The model requires prepa-
ration of a better data base from available information, separate calibra-
tion of submodels to various subcatchments in the basin, extension of the
record base to trace human impact and other changes in the catchment area,
and the addition of an interception component and some modification of the
soil moisture routine to further study man-made changes.
Proposed Development of a Hydrological Forecasting Model for Karnataka
13.       While it is not suggested that the Swedish or any other specific
model should necessarily be adopted for use in Karnataka, development of an
1/ Results of a completed Phase I of the adaptation and a program for a
Phase II are contained in a paper by SMHI, see Annex 3, No. 6.

appropriate hydrological forecasting system, based on continuous water
balance techniques, is a necessity for future irrigation development (not
only for tanks). Apart from providing a more accurate estimate of periodic
catchment runoff to be expected under given rainfall patterns, it would
also facilitate cross-checks on existing methods of estimating peak-runoff
for the design of overflow sections of reservoirs. A program is therefore
proposed to develop (if possible, with existing Indian technological re-
sources) a forecasting model to be calibrated for catchments in Karnataka.
Calibration of such model would be carried out with data on one or several
well gauged pilot catchments and/or subcatchments in Karnataka. The pilot
catchment area and/or subcatchments would be chosen consistent with the
best available rainfall and runoff records, proximity to qualified govern-
ment personnel and required facilities and the desired range of catchment
characteristics to be faced in future tank project development. Evaluation
of data on up to three catchments or subcatchments within the pilot area is
proposed over a 10-12 month period beginning concurrently with overall
project implementation. The program would be operational in 1982 at which
time a decision would be taken as to its possible continuation, refinement,
expansion or discontinuation. Implementation of the program as described
or with modifications as necessary, will depend on the results of an initial
field review to select the pilot area(s) including the availability and
applicability of existing rainfall-runoff data. The program implies the use
of a programmable desk-top computer with plotter. The use of hand-held pro-
grammable calculators is a potentially viable alternative for runoff yield
estimates but would be limited in its ability to handle future process im-
provements and expansion of computer usage to other hydrological estimates.
14.       The overall responsibility for and coordination of the development
of the model would rest with the Karnataka Engineering Research Station at
Mysore which is well qualified for this task. The research station would
seek the technical assistance from a hydrological institute with the neces-
sary expertise on the techniques involved. It is understood that such ex-
pertise is existing in India. The Department of Irrigation and other agen-
cies of GOK and GOI would provide the necessary data base and would assist
with staff. Training would be provided to about two hydrologists of GOK
on the use, possible modification and maintenance of the model, as well as
on the use of the computing equipment. Expenditures for technical assis-
tance, training and equipment would be reimbursable by IDA under this
proposed credit.

KARNATAKA TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic and Risk Analysis
Prices for Economic Analysis
1.        General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs
and inputs are derived from the IBRD projected 1990 world market prices ex-
pressed in 1980 currency value with appropriate adjustments for freight, hand-
ling and processing. The projected economic prices for non-traded foodgrains,
on the other hand, are derived by applying a foodgrain conversion factor (FCF)
to the financial price. The financial prices of various crops are projected
on the basis of their historical price trends. Present and projected finan-
cial and economic prices are given in Table 1. The assumptions behind the
estimates are described below.
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
2.        Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was officially valued at a fixed
Pound Sterling rate. Since then, it has been fixed against a "basket" of
currencies. As these currencies are floating, the US Dollar/Rupee exchange
rate is subject to change. Conversions of financial prices have been made
at US$1 to Rs 8.40.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
3.        The benefits of the TIPs are evaluated at world market prices, i.e.,
they measure what India would have to pay for imports or receive for exports.
Most of the costs, however, are for items that are not traded on the world
market. Tariffs and trade restrictions introduce a distortion in the price
relationship between traded goods--valued at world markets--and non-traded
goods--valued at local prices. Thus, the costs are not directly comparable
with the benefits. In order to make them comparable, an SCF is applied to
the price of non-traded goods. In the absence of trade restrictions, the
SCF can be approximately calculated using the formula:
SCF        x+m         1
X + S + M+T  1/
x        m
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives an SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restric-
tions, it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian Planning
Commission recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects the use of
conversion factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods that implicitly
give a SCF of about 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this estimate,
a SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
1/  X - export value (f.o.b.); M = import value (c.i.f.);
S  = subsidies on exports; T  = taxes and duties on imports.

Page 2
Prices of Agricultural Outputs (Table 1)
4.        The economic prices for traded goods such as rice, wheat, cotton,
groundnuts, and sugarcane are based on their border prices at the official
exchange rate (OER). The domestic cost components (i.e., local processing,
transport and marketing charges) are adjusted by the SCF of 0.80. The
economic prices for non-traded foodgrains (sorghum, millets, pulses) are derived
by applying a foodgrain conversion factor to the financial price. The
foodgrain conversion factor was estimated as a weighted average of implicit
conversion factors for traded foodgrains. The financial prices for various
crops were derived from the estimated wholesale price trends over the last
eight years in Karnataka and adjusted to arrive at farmgate prices. They
represent 1980 current prices.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs (Table 1)
5.        Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world market price.
Pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded; no conversion
factor has been applied to their financial prices. The economic price of
seed and miscellaneous charges has also been assumed to approximate the
financial price. The financial price of bullocks (equivalent to the rental
price for one pair with operator per day) has been multiplied by the SCF to
express it in economic terms.
Agricultural Wages
6.        Observed wage rates vary seasonally and regionally between Rs 3
and Rs 8 per man-day for rainfed agriculture, and between Rs 4 and Rs 10
for irrigated agriculture. Regional variations do not exceed about + 12%
of the State average; uniform rates have therefore been adopted for all
agroclimatic zones, since zone-wise rates were not available. Seasonal
variations were averaged out by adopting seasonally weighted daily wage
rates, based on the following financial seasonal rates:
Rainfed                Irrigated
(Rs/manday)             (Rs/manday)
Slack Season                  3 (3 months)             3 (3 months)
Intermediate Season           5 (7 months)             6 (6 months)
Peak Season                   8 (2 months)            10 (3 months)
Average                   5.0                      6.3
Economic wage rates were derived from the financial ones assuming that for the
slack period the financial wage is a good approximation for the shadow wage
(reservation wage), that the same holds true for peak wages, and that only
during the intermediate season the financial wage overstates the opportunity
cost of labour by some 40%. To the weighted average average shadow wage rates so
derived, the SCF (0.8) was applied, resulting in economic wages of Rs 3.3
for the "without project" situation and Rs 4.3 for the "with project"
situation. When compared to financial wage rates, this is equivalent to an
unskilled-labor conversion factor of about 0.67.

Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
7.          The schemes would be constructed using a mixture of equipment,
skilled and unskilled labor. For the economic analysis, the CCF is estimated
as follows:
(a)    Traded Component.  This component includes   capital-intensive
works which require imported materials, Hence the conversion
factor is 1.00. it is estimated that about 17% of the
construction costs fall under this category.
(b)    Non-Traded Component.  This component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 43% of the construction costs are included
in this category.
(c)    Unskilled Labor.  A ratio of economic to financial wages
similar to the one assumed for agricultural labor (67%)
has been assumed tor unskilled construction labor. It is
estimated that unskilled labor constitutes about 55% of the
construction costs.
Conversion   Weight
Factor
Traded Items                               1.00         0.17
Non-Traded Items                           0.80         0.43
Unskilled Labor                            0.67         0.40
Construction Costs (weighted average)    0.78           1.00
Discounting Factor
8.         A 12% discount rate has been chosen for the analysis, as this
rate approximately represents the opportunity cost of capital in India.
The first year of the construction period is chosen as the base year for
discounting purposes. Discounting is applied from the first period on.
Benefits
9.         Crop Budgets.  Assessment of future yields, with as well as
without project, was based on indications of agricultural officials
in the State, on yield statistics (generally available only up to
1977/78 for rainfed and irrigated crops separately, and of uncertain
reliability) and on direct information in the field. Cautious projections
to 1980 for with project yields of major crops under irrigation were made
on this basis. They represent an assessment of what should be safely
feasible for moderately progressive farmers under assured water-supply
conditions in an average year, given the associated amount of material
inputs (about 60-70% of recommended levels) and a satisfactory extension

service. Project yield levels are, however, somewhat lower than what
has been witnessed in several areas under tank irrigation, in order to
reflect conditions closer to the average. Rainfed yields were more easily
derived from available statistics, they have been adjusted slightly
upwards (about +14%) to reflect past productivity trends. Irrigation
yields are assumed uniform throughout the State, since water requirements
were calculated so as to adjust for differences in rainfall and evapo-
transpiration in various agroclimatic zones. Rainfed yields, however,
were varied in relation to an annual standard yield (State average) for
each agroclimatic zone. When zonal yields differed from the assumed
standard, input requirements (except seeds) were also adjusted upwards
or downwards, but only by half the rate of yield variation (assumed
input/yield elasticity of 0.5). Standard yields and input requirements
for the State are shown in Annex 1, T-12, and zonal yields and crop-
budgets in Annex 1, T-13. Economic crop budgets do not include interest
on working capital (11% of 40% of total input cost), land revenue or
water charges as do financial crop budgets. The estimated value ot
byproducts is the same for economic and financial crop budgets.
Cropping Patterns
10.         Without project (rainfed) cropping patterns were projected
on the basis of taluk-wise cropping statistics. Cropping intensities
reflect to some degree differences in precipitation for various agro-
climatic zones. Projected "with-project" cropping patterns, which contain
also some rainfed crops (mostly pulses) are the result of the examination
of existing cropping patterns under irrigation, the consideration of
established government policies on promotion or restriction of certain
crops in irrigated areas and to which degree these could probably be
enforced, and the economic attractiveness of various crops to irrigating
farmers. The latter depends considerably on the amount ot water a
farmer expects to be able to secure for himself, and therefore on the
operational characteristics of tank irrigation projects. Under essentially
equal and equitable distribution practices the cultivation of some water-
intensive crops (paddy, sugarcane) might well be automatically reduced
toa minimum, tor a limited amount of total supply. The projected cropping
patterns contain a share of such water-intensive crops that is lower than
the average in irrigated agriculture of the dry and transitional zones,
but higher than what would be considered optimal from the standpoint of
allocation of a scarce resource. Irrigation intensities vary between
70% and 90% for the kharif season, 35% and 80% for the rabi season and
2% and 20% for perennial crops, according to a rough estimate of annual
water supply per ha of CCA for different zones. Overall irrigation
intensities were projected so as to exhaust such average annual water
supply. For details on zonal cropping patterns, crop budgets, cropping
intensities and average net returns refer to Annex 1, T-13.

Build-up Rates
11.        In order to take account of a gradual increase in water
release and in areas coming under irrigation, as well as of a gradual
adoption process of improved practices, better varieties and higher
input applications, a benefit build-up process, combining area and
productivity build-up, was assumed for a period of five years after
completion of construction of a project, and applied to the estimated
full development benefits as follows:
Year after completion of construction       1      2     3      4     5
Percent of full development benefits       36    64    84    96   100
Costs
12.        The economic cost of construction was derived from typical
cost estimates for various size groups of tank irrigation projects, at
first as a weighted per-ha cost, weights being the expected shares of
these size groups in the overall program (Annex 1, T-3). The average
water supply (= demand) per ha derived from the zonal cropping patterns
(10,800 m3) was then related to the per ha cost (Rs 24,490) 1/ to arrive
at a financial unit cost per m3 (Rs 2.26) of water available in the
average year at the reservoir outlet. (Net water requirements at the
field and gross water requirements at the reservoir outlet are related
by overall project efficiencies assumed as about 60% for upland crops
and 77% for paddy. The average efficiency, as implied by zonal cropping
patterns,over all zones is estimated as about 63%). This unit cost was
further adjusted by a construction conversion factor of 0.78 (para 7
of this Annex) to arrive at economic construction cost.
13.        The financial cost of operation and maintenance is estimated
by the Irrigation Department as about Rs 85/ha. Since O&M involves
primarily employment of unskilled or semi-skilled labor, a low conversion
factor of 0.70 was applied.
14.        The opportunity loss of production of rainfed crops in the area
submerged by the reservoir was estimated as the same per-ha economic net
return as in the command area without project. However, 20% of the submerged
area was nevertheless assumed to be cultivated in periods when the reservoir
is empty, as is custom in many tanks. The economic loss is therefore
assumed to be about Rs 1,050 per ha of submerged land. On average, an area
equivalent to about 15% of the CCA would be submerged. The final economic
loss is thus assessed at about Rs 158 per ha of CCA. The cost of O&M and
of submerged lands together is less than Rs 0.02 per m3 of water, or about
1% of the investment cost.
Cost Schedules
15.       For the purpose of determining maximum allowable construction
costs, four different construction cost schedules were assumed:
1/ A basic construction cost of Rs 21,300/ha was increased by 15% to take
account of other project related costs.

The cost of O&M and the loss from submergence were assumed to be fully
incurred starting after the last year of construction. For the purpose
of economic evaluation of the overall project, an average construction
period of three years was assumed.
Method of Cost-Benefit Analysis
16.       Instead of only evaluating the estimated incremental benefits
and cost per ha of CCA, the approach here adopted integrates estimated
water supply and demand into the analysis. This has three advantages:
(a) water as the actual benefit-generating factor is more
clearly emphasized;
(b) assumptions on water requirements and water availability
are made explicit; and
(c) the approach allows to test the project's sensitivity to
assumptions on water supply and demand, and to calculate
cut-off rates for investment cost per unit of water.
As a starting point, a"normal" application rate of water per ha of CCA was
projected for the dry, traditional and high rainfall zones. Cropping
patterns and implied irrigation intensities were then adjusted so as to
result in water requirements that approximately exhaust the norm applica-
tion in m per ha. Water requirements and average net returns per ha of
CCA with project and without project for each zone were subsequently
weighted (by a zone's expected share in overall project CCA) to arrive
at overall average values for the State: The estimated economic net re-
turn per ha with project is Rs 7,226, compared to Rs 1,316 without project.
T8e estimated average water requirement at the reservoir outlet is 10,809
m per ha of CCA, with an implied average project conveyance and field
application efficiency of about 0.63.
17.        From these estimates the incremental return to water (or "value
of water") of calculated as
X, - X0
v =
where X = net return per ha of CCA with project



-119-
ANNEX 7
Page 7
XO = net return per ha of CCA without project
W = water requirement per ha of CCA, with project
This value is estimated as Rs 0.547/mr3 for the project as a whole. Since
the zonal values of water, which were separately calculated in the same
fashion, vary somewhat with assumptions on the overall irrigation inten-
sity, the average value for all zones was tested for its sensitivity to
changes in the annual dry-season irrigation intensity, because any short-
falls in actual water supply are likely to result in reduced double
cropping. As can be seen from Table 2, the overall average for the value
of water does not change to any significant degree with varying assump-
tions on irrigation intensity 1/. The benefits from an average project de-
pend therefore only on the actual quantity of water available in a typical
hydrological year:
B - v   q
They do not depend, a priori, on assumptions about the size of a project (CCA).
However, the approach here chosen has to make such an assumption indirectly,
since the total amount of water made available in the State through the
proposed project depends on total project cost and estimated cost per unit
of water. The latter in turn is derived from per ha cost established earlier
(Annex 1, T-3), and under the assumptions that the projected water availa-
bility per ha of CCA would equal the estimated average water requirement of
about 10,809 m3 per ha of CCA, which is a result of assumed cropping patterns.
Thus, the incremental benefit per ha at full development is:
b = v   q = 5,912 Rs/ha
where q = 10,809 m3 /ha
This result could, of course, have been taken directly from the assumed
net returns per ha with and without project. However, this would have been
at the cost of leaving crucial assumptions unmentioned. Furthermore, sen-
sitivity to estimates of water requirements, of water supply and of the
cost of water can now be explored in a more straightforward manner. Eco-
nomic benefit and cost streams were derived by applying build-up rates
and cost schedules (paras 11 and 15) to the benefit and cost of water
respectively. For convenience, these streams are presented for an average
hectare of CCA in Annex 1, T-16.
1/ The assumption of diminishing marginal returns to water does not apply
in this context, since water supply would not be increased on any given
area, but rather more hectares would be irrigated at a constant water
application rate in the dry season.

ANNEX 7

Cut-Off Rates for the Cost of Water
18.       Economic evaluation of the individual tank irrigation projects
(TIPs) would be considerably simplified by comparing estimated costs of
water to a critical limit of such cost, established for each agroclimatic
zone (Annex 1, T-15). These critical limits are derived as switching
values for the cost per cubic meter of water available in an average
year at the reservoir outlet. The calculation of switching values proceeds
as follows:
NPV = PVB - PVCON - PVOM
with NPV     net present
PVB     present value of benefits
PVCON = present value of construction cost
PVOM = present value of O&M cost
The present values (per ha of CCA) of the component streams depend on
assumed benefit (cost) parameters (v or c) and on the discounted value of
the build-up (or construction) schedules (k).
PVB   = v * q    kb
PVCON = cW   q    k
PVOM  = cOM   k
Om Om
The discounted build-up schedules in turn depend on the assumed construction
period (para 15). The critical parameter is the maximum permissible cost
of water, c* (in Rs/m3). It can be determined by setting the NPV = 0.
NPV = PVB - PVCON - PVOM = 0
PVB - PVOM = PVCON
v *q    kb ~-cOM *koM   c*    q    c
v * kb - OMq * ko
r* =             OY      O
w            kc . CCF                        (CCF = construction conversion
f actor)
The critical value depends mainly on the estimated value of water, v (para 17)
and on the supply of water per ha of CCA, q. Both parameters vary over dif-
ferent agroclimatic zones, but q is held constant (at 10,830 m3/ha) since its
variations are of negligible importance 1/. The present values of build-up
and construction schedules are listed below for different construction periods:
1/ The cost of O&M per m3 of water is very small in relation to the value
of water (0.006 vs. 0.55).

19.       Inserting zonal values of water (Annex 1, T-14) as well as economic
cost of O&M into the above equation, one obtains the cut-off rates for econo-
mic investment cost per cubic meter of water. These values have been divided
by the construction conversion factor to arrive at financial cost. Since the
values of water within the dry zones, the transitional zones and the high
rainfall (as a group respectively) are not considered to differ significantly,
average values for each group were taken and corresponding average cut-off
rates calculated for the three groups. All cut-off rates were subsequently
increased by 5%, so as to take account of possible errors in economic analysis.
20.       Example:
Zones 1, VII and VIII (transitional zones):
Average value of water:  v = Rs 0.5386/mi3

Risk Analysis
21.        In order to assess the risks associated with uncertainty about
actual inflows into a reservoir, two ways of analysis were chosen: (i)
on the basis of a correlation of observed with estimated inflows, an
estimate of the standard deviation of actual from estimate inflows was
made, and a confidence interval for the actual inflow around the esti-
mate was build; (ii) various levels of actual inflows (random events)
were combined with various project sizes (actions); for each combina-
tion of conditional present values of costs and benefits have determined,
and expected payoff for each project size was calculated on the basis
of an a-priori distribution of inflows. The latter approach follows
the reasoning of decision theory.
22.        A sample of twelve catchments in Karnataka (Annex 6, Table 1)
was available for comparison of actual runoff yields and of runoffs esti-
mated by Strange's formula for "average" catchments. (This is the tra-
ditional estimation method for catchments for which no actual runoff
gauging data is available.) In order to eliminatedifferent absolute
yield levels, relative deviations of actual from estimated runoffs were
calculated (as percent of estimate). The standard deviation of those
actual observations from the mean (= 100) was estimated as 27.4%. The
sample distribution is not quite symmetrical, but the apparent skewness
was not considered significant. For simplicity, a normal distribution
with mean 100 and standard deviation 27.4 was assumed. From this a
lower confidence limit for actual inflows was derived on the basis of
Prob (actual inflow >Q)   90%
Q, the lower limit, is derived from tables of the normal distribution as
65 (percent of estimate). There is therefore a chance of 10% that actual
inflow will be lower than 65% of the estimate. Incremental benefits are
assumed to be proportional to available water, thus the net present
value per ha of CCA would be reduced to about 23% of the appraisal NPV
(Rs 14,000), given a cost-benefit ratio of 1.84 as estimated for the
proposed projectcl! For a lower cost-benefit ratio (say 1.2), NPV would
be reduced from an implicit Rs 3,340/ha to Rs-3,670,which is equiva-
lent to a rate of return less than 12%. In order to avoid, with 90%
chance, the risk of a negative NPV, the cost-benefit ratio should be
greater than about 1.54 for the average project, given the estimated
average cost. This latter ratio would imply a shortfall in incremental
benefits in the order of 16% relative to the appraisal estimate.
23.        The second approach is based on the following assumption:
(a)   The project cost per ha varies inversely with size.  Variations
were calculated on the basis of standard unit costs (Annex 1,
T-3) for various size groups, according to the regression
formula:
1/ The economic rate of return in this case would be about 14%.



-123-
ANNEX 7
Page 11
Cost per ha = 33,048 - 2,306 . In CCA
(b)   Benefits are proportional to actual water supply (constant
value of water) as long as actual inflow does not exceed
the norm inflow for a given project size.
(c)   For inflows in excess of the norm for a given size, bene-
fits increase less than proportionally with water supply,
due to reservoir and distribution system constraints, up
to a maximum of 108% of "norm benefits" for a given project
size, when excess supply reaches 15% of normal supply.
Any additional water would be lost through spilling.
(d)   Normal distributions of actual inflow as percent of estimated
inflow with three different standard deviations were assumed
to reflect estimation procedures for runoff yield with dif-
ferent degrees of accuracy:
- 27% standard deviation (low accuracy)
- 10% standard deviation (medium accuracy)
- 3% standard deviation (high accuracy)
The standard deviation of 27% for low accuracy methods was taken to repre-
sent Strangets estimation method (para 22). Inflows are varied stepwise
rather than continuously. A matrix of conditional benefits and the size -
specific costs are illustrated in Tables 3A-3C. Benefits and costs
(present values) are given as percent of appraisal benefits, i.e., for
size = 100 and inflow = 100.
24.       Subsequently conditional net present values (as percent of
appraisal benefits, not shown) were multiplied by the probability for
each level of inflow, resulting in a second matrix as shown in Tables 3A-
3C. The column sum for each project size indicates the expected net
present value (EPV) for that size ("expected monetary value" of a decision
in decision analysis). The project size with the highest EPV would be the
optimal size to choose under risk-neutrality. The optimum size is the same
for all distributions of estimation error for high and medium benefit/cost
ratios. For lower benefit/cost ratios, however, the first method would
have given a considerably lower optimum size, while more accurate methods
give optimum sizes closer to the appraisal size.
25.        The right most column in the second matrix gives the highest
weighted net present value for each level of inflow, representing the
project size that h.d been chosen if inflow had been known with certainty
before the decision on size was taken.  The sum of this column is the
"expected net present value under certainty" (EPVC); it is always higher
than the EPV of the optimum size under uncertainty. The difference
between the EPVC and the optimum EPV is the "expected value of perfect
information" (EVPI), which decreases, of course, with better estimation



-124-
ANNEX 7
Page 12
methods. The EVPI is what one would pay for a survey to get a perfect
projection of the actual runoff yield. Optimum sizes, EPV, EPVC and
EVPI are summarized for different distributions and different underlying
cost-benefit ratios in Table 4.
26.        The actual implications of this analysis need further study.
So far one conclusion may safely be drawn: The cost of obtaining more
information to reduce uncertainty is not so much the cost of more stream
gauging or more sophisticated estimation methods. The real cost is the
net present value lost by delaying construction based on less reliable
water supply estimates, which is about 30% of the net present value for
immediate construction at a discount rate of 12% over a survey period of
3 years. None of the above-mentioned assumptions on the accuracy of
presently used estimation techniques would result in an "expected value
of perfect information" so high as to justify this cost of delay. This
does in no way preclude the usefulness of better techniques and increased
hydrological information for future projects, where they could result in
considerable reduction of expected risk.

KARNATAKA TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT
Economic Justification of Canal Lining
General
1.        The design criteria established for tank irrigation schemes under
the proposed project stipulate that all canals and channels down to turnouts
serving 8 ha blocks should be lined. (Field channels would not be lined,
except for a part of excessively long or steep channels.) The following
analysis provides an economic justification for such higher design standards.
2.        The analysis is based on a comparison of costs and benefits
between a lined and an "equivalent" unlined canal system. Equivalence means
that both systems depend on the same annual water supply from the tank, and
that both systems will deliver the same volume of water per ha of CCA at the
8 ha-turnouts, given the respective conveyance losses for each system. The
unlined system, under these assumptions, will always be somewhat smaller in
extent.
3.        Lining affects conveyance losses and costs of a system in several
ways. Primarily, it reduces the seepage rate per unit wetted area. Second,
operational losses (water at the wrong time at the wrong place, wastage,
breakage, tampering, spillage, etc.) are minimized. Rotation of water supply
is faster and more easily controllable, and deliveries are more reliable and
equitable among farmers. Higher velocities due to lining permit relatively
smaller channels and reduce wetted perimeters and the risk of silting.
Lining also allows steeper side slopes and longitudinal slopes (gradient),
which further reduces the wetted area and increases the velocity of lined
channels (in relation to an unlined channel of the same capacity). The cost
of structures will also be less under such options. Since it is difficult
to quantify the cumulative effect of lining on losses and on costs under both
design alternatives in general terms, simplifying but conservative assump-
tions have been made.
Assumptons
4.        Losses.  Overall losses from the tank outlet to 8 ha turnouts con-
sist of seepage losses and of operational losses. Seepage rates for lined
systems would normally be less than 3 cusec/Mft2 (1 cumec/m1)Z.  This high
value has, however, been adopted for the analysis. Seepage in unlined systems
has been measured at between 5 cusec and 70 cusec per Mft  in various canals
in India. The average for smaller size canals (minors and sub-minors),
which correspond to the canal sizes typical for tank irrigation schemes, is
around 15-20 cusec/Mft2. A lower, conservative value of 12 cusec/Mft2 (3.66
cumec/Mm2) has been adopted here. Lining greatly improves the manageability
of distribution systems, particularly in rather small systems such as tank



-132-                       ANNEX 8
Page 2
schemes. Operational losses would not exceed about 12% of head supply; thus
this value was adopted for a lined system. In unlined systems, these losses
are generally estimated at about 20%, and this value is used here.
Capacities and Wetted Perimeters
5.        Design parameters for typical trapezoidal canals foi a lined and
an unlined system, both serving the same command area (100 ha) were calcu-
lated in such a way that peak discharge at the tail end of the systems would
be equal for the respective conveyance losses.!/ Losses turned out to be
about 15% of head capacity for the lined system and 31% for the unlined one.
Accordingly, the unlined system was then reduced to 82% of the original size
and new design parameters calculated for canals serving a smaller area and
having the same peak discharge per ha of CCA at the 8 ha turnouts as the
lined system. As a result, the wetted perimeter of the "equivalent" unlined
system at the head was estimated as about 39 m2/ha versus 31 m2/ha for the
lined system./ The cross-sectional area of the unlined system would be
about 24% larger and the velocity about 24% smaller than for the lined system.
Both systems would have the same peak capacity at the head.
Determination of System Size and Total Losses
6.        Consistent with assumptions made in the economic analysis of the
project, a norm water application of 6,380 m3/ha/year at the field was
assumed. Given a combined field channel and field application efficiency
of 76%, this translates into 9,180 m3/ha/year at 8 ha turnouts. Given an
annual design water supply at the reservoir of 1.0 Mm3, the respective
command areas of a lined and unlined system can be estimated by means of
the following relationship:
1,000,000   9,180 * CCA + (rp.Lf *T  CCA) (1 -d ) + i    1,000,000

An adjustment factor f, approximately takes account of the combined effect
of rotation of water supply (only parts of the system are wet at any one
time), of smaller capacities for lateral channels and of gradually decreasing
wetted perimeters of main and lateral channels. This factor has been esti-
mated as 0.6. The fact that seepage rates are much higher at the beginning
of a rotational cycle (when channel is dry) has been ignored; it would affect
seepage in unlined channels considerably more than in lined channels. The
CCA of the lined system results as about 93 ha, while the unlined system
would comprise only about 77 ha. Overall losses in the lined system would be
about 147,600 m3/year (14.8%); in the unlined system they would amount to
about 294,200 m3/year (29.4%). The savings in water from a lined system
amount therefore to about 146,600 m3/year (at the 8 ha turnouts).
Incremental Benefits
7.        Benefits are derived from the volume of water available at the
turnouts to 8 ha irrigation blocks, and from the estimated incremental bene-
fits per unit of water. The "value of water" has been estimated to average
about Rs 0.55/m3. However, to be conservative, a value of Rs 0.55 only was
chosen. The buildup of benefits, starting in the third year for the unlined
system and in the fourth year for the lined system, is assumed to follow the
five-year schedule presented in Annex 7, para 11. The present value (12%,
50 years) of incremental benefits results as Rs 175,400.
Costs
8.        The cost of the reservoir itself would be approximately the same
for both lined and unlined systems.  The composition of the cost of the
distribution network per ha of CCA is estimated as follows: /
Lined                Unlined
(Rs/ha)               (Rs/ha)
Earthworks and Structures                  1,100                 1,300
Lining                                     2,100                   -
Outlets, Field Channels and
Drainage                                   700                   700
Land Acquisition                             100                   150
4,000                 2,150
Total cost of the respective systems, given their sizes, works out to
Rs 371,600 and Rs 165,300. A conversion factor of 0.78 is applied to the
financial cost to arrive at economic cost. The present value of incremental

economic cost is estimated at Rs 126,700.-/ The net present value of lining
is estimated at about Rs 49,000, the economic rate of return at 14%. Since
tank irrigation projects would be generally located where groundwater devel-
opment is practically non-existent, the impact of lining on the recharge to
groundwater has not been examined.

years for the lined system. Cost scheduling as in Annex 7, para 15.
