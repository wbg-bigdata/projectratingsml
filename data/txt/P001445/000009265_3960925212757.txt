PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CREDIT 1563-LBR)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Water
Supply Project in the Republic of Libetia, for which Credit 1563-LBR in the amount
of SDR 5.1 (US$5.0) million was approved on March 21, 1985. Liberia was in non-
accrual status during most of the project, initially from February 1985 to September
1986, then again from December 1986 to the present and disbursements were
suspended during that period. An exception to the disbursement suspension was made
for the technical assistance component of the project up to December 31, 1987.
A total of SDR 2.9 (US$3.7) million or about 57% of the credit was
disbursed by the date of final disbursement, February 1, 1988, which leaves SDR 2.2
miliUon undisbursed. There are no outstanding coninitments. The credit closed on
December 31, 1990, and, in accordance with Operational Directive of April 1989 (OD
13.30, para. 14), the undisbursed balance should be cancelled within two months of
the closing date. Although there is no Government in place for the Bank to
communicate formal closing, the undisbursed balance could now be treated as
cancelled to enable the Bank to free funds which it is otherwise obligated to keep in
liquid resources (OD 13.30, para. 2). As soon as there is a new Government in the
Republic of Liberia, the Bank can take the additional steps to communicate closing
and cancellation of the credit.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of the Western
Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and I) based on a review
of documents available in the Regional Information Center and discussions with staff
involved with the project's evolution. Part II could not be prepared by the Borrower
because of difficult country conditions.

~~QIY_kUL_SUPPL ROECTM (CREDrr 1563-LBR)
Eroject Evaluation Summarr
i.          The intention of the Second Water Supply Project was to help resolve
deficiencies of the First Water Supply Project (Credit 859-LBR; PCR No. 5754 dated
June 26, 1985) and arrest the steady decline in the operations of the Liberia Water and
Sewerage Company (LWSC). The project had originally included provision for
phjsical investments in distribution and transmission systems, technical assistance and
training, studies and designs, and procurement of equipment and supplies through a
cofinancing arrangement with AfDB. Upon the withdrawal of AfDB at the start of the
project, due to Liberia's liquidity problems, the project was scaled down to exclude
the major construction item under the project costing US$4 million (pam. 5).
ii.         At the time of project preparation, there was serious neglect in the
operation of LWSC's treatment plant and pumping stations which resulted in excessive
costs and wear. Financial problems were immense, stemming largely from inadequate
consumer control and data processing deficiencies, so that LWSC was dependent to a
very large degree on the overloaded Government budget, with consequent loss of
managerial autonomy. The LWSC was overstaffed at the lower levels and efficiency
was very low.
iii.        The project made micro gains in improving LWSC's financial
management with the steady, tedious work of a team of technical assistance staff
financed by GIZ and with IDA's persistence. At the same time, however,
sustainability could not be ensured as the project had neither the leverage nor the
policy support.
iv.         Overall financial performance remained poor. While LWSC succeeded
in increasing its collection efficiency over time, the amounts collected were barely
sufficient to cover salary expenses. Billings continued to reflect flat rate charges and
charges based on faulty meters. [A metering program under the project was curtailed
when funds dried up]. With neither government subventions nor government
payments forthcoming, maintenance suffered, unaccounted-for-water grew, steering
LWSC into its pre-appraisal operating condition.
v.          An economic rate of return was not calculated at appraisal, the project
having been justified on non-quantifiable benefits. It is now questionable whether any
qualititative benefits could be attributed to the project (para. 24).



- iii -
vi.        In retrospect, it appears that at the outset, chances for any impact would
have been very slim in the light of the following countervailing factors: (i) serious and
worsening liquidity problems of the GOL; (ii) significant and growing GOL arrears to
LWSC; (iii) the critical need for more project resources which were not forthcomning;
(iv) LWSC's past institutional and financial performance under the First Wauei Supply
Project; and (v) widespread difficulties in LWSC which could not be adequately
addressed in the context of a rescue operadon.
vii.       TMe experience from this project gives rise to a set of questions which
are easy to ask in retrospect but difficult to answer. Why attempt a miniscule rescue
operation in the midst of severe country and sector problems and at a time when other
Bankc/DA-ftnanced projects, with reinforcing objectives, such as the Structural
Adjustment Credit, were on hold? Should there not have been a greater degree of
commitment up front from the Government vis-a-vis counterpart funding and
settlement of arrears to LWSC (which were about US$5.5 million at project
preparation and grew to US$10 million by 1989) before the project became effective?
Given that the Bank Group was not obligated to disburse funds if the GOL/LWSC did
not comply with its legal covenants, why did the Bank/IDA not stop all disbursements
sooner and cancel the remainder of the credit? When are the costs of techni.al
assistance too high for the accrued benefits?
viii.       One lesson that can be derived from this project's experience is that
success is very difficult to achieve and sustain under adverse policy and institutiona'
conditions. A small-scale operation such as this one might have had a fair chance of
success (i.e. the gains made could have been sustained) under conditions of: (i)
government policy commitment; and (ii) the operation being catalytic in mobilizing
additional donor support.

Loan/Credit No:    Credit 1563-LBR
RVP Unit:         Western Africa
Country:          Republic of Liberia
Sector:           Infrastructure
B. Background
1.          The first Bank-financed water supply project in Monrovia (Credit 859-
LiAR; Project Completion Report (PCR) No. 5754 dated June 26, 1985) had mixed
results. While the physical components of the project were quite successfully
completed, the software aspects (institutional, financial and operational) needed to
sustain these investments were not successful. Several reasons had been given in the
PCR for this outcome, the most important being management changes and increased
Government intervention since the 1980 coup. The ensuing deterioration of the
financial position of the Liberia Water Supply Company (LWSC) left it on the brink
of financial collapse.
2.          The Second Liberia Water Supply Project was designed as a rescue
operation, with emphasis on technical assistance and rehabilitation to prevent.
irreversible decay of the physical system and to start developing an institution which
could meet the water supply needs of Monrovia's growing population. It was hoped
that by revamping LWSC's financial and accounting systems as well as helping to
improve its operating efficiency, LWSC's financial collapse could be avoided. Based
on the lessons of the first project, physical components were to be undertaken only
after specific institutional and financial targets were met. This second project also
continued on from the Monrovia Urban Development Project (CR 1223-LBR; PCR
No. 7865) which helped to improve water supply through installation of 52 standpipes.
Provision for their maintenance was included in this project.
3.          The second water supply project was conceived and evolved during a
very difficult time for Liberia. The country continued to have trouble in keeping
repayments to the Bank Group current, and disbursements of all loans and credit: were
suspended, initially from February 1985 to September 1986, then again from
December 1986 to present. Nevertheless, a decision was taken to process the loan
(Board approval March 21, 1985) with the condition that prospects for resolving
Liberia's immediate liquidity problems and meeting debt service commitments to the
Bank Group looked reasonably good. Simultaneous discussions during the month of
March 1985 between the Liberia Govemment, the IEM  and the US Govemment led to



-2 -
asswrances that a two-year financial program for the country would enable Liberia to
pay off its outstanding debts to the Bank Group. Thlese expectations czme to
fruition on September 30, 1986 when Liberia cleared all arrears to the Bank Group by
paying US$18 million, most of which was US-financed.
4.          The project was approved in March 1985 but, because of the country's
non-accrual status, could not be declared effective until October 1986 (Annex Table 1
provides dates for key stages in processing of the project). No formal steps could be
taken to close the loan and car I the undisbutsed balance in the absence of a
Governunent in Liberia. However, as the closing date has expired (December 31,
1990), and there are no outstanding commitm-nts, thc undisbursed balance of the
credit (SDR 2.2 million) can be treated as cancelled to allow the Bank to free funds
which it is otherwise obligated to keep in liquid resources (OD 13.30, April 1989). As
soon as there is a new Govemment in Liberia, the Bank can take the additional steps
to communicate closing and cancellation of the credit.
5.          Total costs of the project under review wete to be financed by IDA, the
African Development Bank (AfDB), Gernany (GTZ), and the Government of Liberia
(GOL). The AfDB subsequently withdrew from the project because of Liberia's
overdue payments to AfDB/AfDF, and the project had to be scaled down accordingly
(parm. 8).
C. Project Obiectives and Descrintion
6.          The objectives of the project as stated in the SAR were to:
(a)   effectively and efficiently manage the financial and human resources of
LWSC;

Reviion inpLoject Scope
8.          As a result of the withdrawal of AfDB3, and the inability of IDA to
secure alternative cofinancing, the major construction component (part (d) (ii)),
amounting to about US$4 million, was removed and the project focussed on technical
assistance, studies, and procurement of basic equipment and supplies.
D. Project Design and Organization
9.          Ihe project was originally designed as a component of a Public
Enterprise Reform project, but later revised as a free-standing project when it was felt
that the inclusion of physical componelits was necessary to bring about both physical
and financial changes in LWSC. The project set about to remove the inefficiencies
that affected all aspects of LWSC's operations. Measures were appropriately taken to
have LWSC assume responsibility for much of the needed improvements and these
were specified in an Action Plan (Annex Table 2) which became a side letter to the
Project Agreement. LWSC was also required to meet standard conditions for Board
presentation, including: (i) the appointment of auditors acceptable to IDA to audit
LWSC's FY83/84 accounts; (ii) reconstitution of the LWSC's Board in accordance
with LWSC's by-laws; and (iii) modifying the structure of LWSC's tariff. Key
financial and operational targets wenm dramwn up to track performance (Annex Table 3).
10.         The project was originally designed to have the physical works
commence only after LWSC's operating performance had sufficiently improved to
benefit from extensions to its system, or two years after implementation of the
technical assistance progtam. However, because of the significant elapsed time
between Board approval and effectiveness, mplementation of the limited volume of
works proceeded simultaneously with the technical assistance program.
11.         To produce maximum benefits to LWSC, IDA staff negotiated with
GTZ to have its team of experts act in executive line functions rather than advisory
(which GTZ would have preferred). This difference in philosophy had to be resolved
early, and GrZ finally agreed to have their team start in executive positions but to
revert to advisory capacity towards the latter part of their tenure to allow counterparts
to assume full responsibility.
12.         A Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) focussing on reforn of the public
enterprises in Liberia and their relationships with the Govemment was being appraised
at the time of this project's appraisal. It was expected that the SAC with its
complementary objectives would reinforce the goals of this project by correcting and
strengthening the overall policy framework for public enterprises. However, the SAC
was never processed.
13.        In retrospect, it appears that the design of the project was reasonable.
The LWSC was required to make important changes which it did initially and which
could have been sustained under a more enabling environment. But, as the project



progressed and country circumstances and liquidity problems worsened, it became
apparent that the. project, as designed, did not have the leverage to have an impact.
E. Prolect Implementation
ject F1ncina
14.        It had been estimated at appraisal that the costs of the project would be
shared by IDA, AfDB, GIfZ and LWSC in amour'ts specified in the table below.
However, as the country's illiquidity situation worsened, counterpart funds grew
scarcer and participation of the cofinancers in the project was trimmed and the major
physical works item was removed (part (d) (ii) of para. 7).

Technical Assistance
15.        Project implementation appeared to be reasonable under the prevailing
poor country and institutional circumstances. The Bank was able to make use of the
time elapsed between credit approval and effectiveness (19 months) to work out many
of the details of imolementation wlth LWSC. By Decen'ber 1985, LWSC had signed
a contract with GIZ (as executing agency for technical assistance) covering four of
the technical assistance positions financed under the credit - financial controller, water
treatment engineer, distribution engineer and manpower/training specialist. In
addition, GTZ provided, on a grant basis, five technical assistance positions -- advisor
to the Managing Director, chief accountant, commercial advisor, outstations advisor
and workshop superintendent. By 1990, a toal of 18 technical assistance personnel
had been assigned to LWSC by GIZ under the project. It is noteworthy that GTZ had
been financing technical asistance positions at LWSC since 1983 (under the first
water supply project) and had therefore been able to provide necessary continuity.
16.        The technical assistance team got fully in place by March/April 1986
and, despite very difficult country conditions, were able to achieve qtute a lot -



- 6 -
perhaps most significant of which were impro-ements, albeit short-term, in financial
discipline within LWSC (para. 22). Paragraphs 31 through 32 further highlight the
challenges which limited the team's accomplishments during implementation. On
December 31, 1987, the technical assistance program, twice exempted from Bank's
suspension of funds to Liberia, was terminated, following a decision by the Bank
Group. Notwithstanding, the GTZ team continued its work with LWSC through
Match 1990.
Procurement
17.         Procurement was fully executed by end August 1987 Chemicals,
vehicles, meters, field equipment, pipes and fittings, communication equipment and
meter repair equipment and accessories weru procured amounting to about $1.5 million
(100% financed by IDA). Local counterpart funds needed for additional purchases
remained in short supply or unavailable during the project.
Physical Works
18.         Although the materials procured with IDA funds were insufficient for
the scope of the task, they turned out to be useful to the technical assistance team and
their counterparts in cartying out limited works. LWSC was thns able to repair the
most seriously deteriorated sections of its system: (i) a 16" Freeway main; (ii)
sections of a 36" transmission main; (iii) the 12" Airfield main; and (iv) rehabilitation
of the City Reservoir. With a distribution system, parts of which only worked
intermittently, and limited qualified and committed manpower, not much could be
done to stem the growing levels of unaccounted-for-water (estimated at about 65%)
partly caused by the number of illegal connections which continued to drain the
system.
Standpipe Privatization
19.         A pilot program of privatization of standpipes launched July 23, 1985
showed positive signs initially but had to be curtailed because of shortage of
counterpart funding. Had the counterpart funding been forthcoming, LWSC could
have been relieved of its responsibility for standpipe maintenance thereby stopping
another drain on its resources.
F. Project Results
Financial Performance
20.         Audited financial statements for LWSC for the project period (1986-
1989) ar ..ot available. It has been difficult to finid sufficient consistent data from
which to derive unaudited financial statements for those years. As a result, it has not
been possible to determine the performance of LWSC vis-a-vis important targets set at
appraisal, such as reduction in the operating deficit, the role of sewerage in the



- 7 -
operating deficit, the value of its assets, and the change in the equity base of the
company. The observations which follow have been based on financial data in
available monthly progress reports.
21.         Annex Table 4 shows a steady improvement in cash collections of
LWSC over the three-year period 1987-1989, but these revenues, averaging about $3.6
million annually, were far below appraisal expectations of about $11 million annually.
One can safely assume that after salaries were paid (and for several months LWSC
was in arrears in salary payments) there was little left for maintenance. This
assumption has been supported by the progtess reports of the technical assistance
team.
22.         To achieve these marginal gains, a considerable amount of financial and
operational discipline had to be injected into the LWSC through: (i) restructuring of
the commercial department; (ii) staff cuts from 640 to less than 450 (although the
target of 400 remained elusive); (iii) producing monthly financial management reports
on a regular basis; (iv) converting LWSC to a proper accrual basis system for
inventories; (v) bringing accounts up to date; and (vi) training of Liberian counterparts
in financial procedures and management.
23.        It was expressed in supervision reports that LWSC's cash collections
could have been further improved if agreement had been made early on a program, for
example, for purging its accounts receivable data of erroneous entries and uncollectible
accounts, restructuring the tariff, and billing consumers based on actual usage. More
work could have been done to identify the numerous illegal connections and take the
necessary corrective action. It had been estimated that illegal connections numbered
5,000 or 25% of total registered connections at the start of the project, and the
situation grew progressively worse.
Rate of Retum
24.         An economic rate of return was not calculated at appraisal as it was
then felt that the project with its very limited investments in physical assets did not
lend itself to such a calculation. The project was justified on the basis on
unquantifiable benefits, including reduction in morbidity and mortality rates as a result
of a more reliable supply of safe water and improved accessibility to low income
groups. Based on infornation contained in an inspection report Aj, project
assumptions about unquantifiable benefits turned out to be overly optimistic. There
was evidence in 1989 that the water quality had deteriorated considerably because of
j/    An inspection report dated February 9, 1990, on the White Plains
Treatment Plant, prepared by a US consulting firm at the request
of LWSC, highlighted the need for urgent repairs and
rehabilitation. It recommended that LWSC secure international
financing on an emergency basis to assess the rehabilitation work
needed to bring the plant into proper operating condition and to
start work shortly thereafter.

lack of counterpart funds and foreign exchange to purchase needed chemicals,
reliability was undermined as services were frequently interrupted, and there is no
evidence that the project was able to improve the poor water supply situation in low-
income residential areas.
Trawna
25.         A manpower training specialist provided under the project came up with
useful recommendations for a new organizational structure for LWSC. A new pay and
benefits scheme was implemented together with a staff performance appraisal scheme;
policies on retirement and redundancy were agreed upon and also established. Staff
received on-the-job, in-country as well as overseas training.
Physical Works
26.         Only a very limited amount of physical works could be done under very
stringent financial circumstances both in the countty and in the LWSC. At the White
Plains Treatment Plant, for example, a new high lift pump was bought and installed
and the old pump removed. Repairs wer also done to improvc, filters; a lime feeder
was repaired and chlorination levels maintained. All outstations were repaired to
function at very basic levels. Because of the need for constant rehabilitative and
preventive maintenance, they could only be operated for 4 to 5 hours per day due to
unreliable electricity supplies or due to shortage of funds to purchase fuel for standby
generators. Repairs at the vehicle and meter repair workshops were hampered by non-
availability of spare parts.
G. Project Sustainability
27.         Sustainability has to be viewed in the light of (i) whether the investment
has been worthwhile; and (ii) whether the investment could be sustained. As the
country economic situadon did not improve, and it appears to have worsened during
implementadon, the GOL could not or would not meet its financial obligations to
LWSC. Indications are that the GOL made no attempt to follow IDA advice on ways
to support the project and LWSC through, for example, offsetting its debt with LWSC
and other parastatals (para 30). As a result, LWSC did not have the counterpart funds
for the project, let alone to continue the limited maintenance programs establiMhed
thereunder. It was also expressed in progress reports by the technical assistance team
that the project addressed only the superficial problems, having been unable to devote
funds so badly needed to rehabilitate, for example, the transmission lines, and carry
out other major repairs and replacement to safeguard LWSC's assets in the longer
term. While the work of the technical assistance team proved to be useful in insdlling
operational and financial discipline into LWSC, indications are that their work under
the project is unLikely to be sustained due to country conditions.



H. IlA erformance
28.         Within the boundaries of the project it appears that MDA had limited
successes. IDA was able to convince the GIZ team of experts to act in an executive
rather than advisory capacity (para. 11) in LWSC, which turned out to be helpful,
particularly to the counterparts in the finance department. ]DA was also instrumental
in establishing and maintaining a very productive working relationship with the
implementing agency and GTZ. In terms of follow through, IDA's performance was
adequate; an average of about two missions per year visited the LWSC, during which
action plans were drawn up and monitored quite closely. At the same time, however,
the task appeared to have had little or no chance of success without adequate
government support.
I. Borrower Performance
29.         LWSC performed no worse than could be expected given the very
unfavorable macro-economic climate in Liberia, GOL's serious Lquidity problems, the
very poor financial condition of the company, and the inefficiency which permeated all
aspects of its operations. Approximately 30% of LWSC's revenues were derived from
the GOL, but the GOL was unable to make any of these payments. In addition, a
significant proportion of the company's arrears (about 40%) were due to non-payment
by the government. Despite IDA's frequent recommendations to seek an offsetting
arrangement between GOL, Liberia Electricity Corporation, and LWSC, as they were
all debtors of the other, LWSC took no action.
30.         On the positive side, marginal changes became apparent in the
performance of the Borrower with the support of a very energetic team of technical
assistance experts and IDA, and improvements, albeit short tern, were made in its
financial systems, staffing levels, operational efficiency and its organizational
structure.
J. Consulting Services
31.         Consulting services were carried out largely by GTZ acting as executing
agency. Based on the contract entered into between the LWSC and GTZ on
December 18, 1985, GIZ recruited a total of eighteen (18) consultants to support
LWSC during the period 1986-1990. Generally, these experts were successful in (i)
improving installation of zonal meters and repair of valves; (ii) completing assessment
of the White Plains Water Treatment Plant and rehabilitation of some equipment; (iii)
assessing the carrying capacity of the transmission system; (iv) improving financial
management; (v) completing the fixed assets register up to 1985/86; and (vi)
introducing a manual stores accounting system. Counterparts were also trained.
32.         Performance of the experts was mixed. It was unanimously agreed that
the financial controller and chief accountant introduced steady financial management
improvements into LWSC. At the same time, however, progress in the technical areas



- 10-
was hindered largely by the liquidity problems of the GOL and the overall difficult
macroeconomic context of the country which led to a variety of problems, including:
(i) di Wubdo aInd JnmiMId: lack of funds to purchase proper equipment, tools and
spare parts; (ii) vehicle workhps: poor quality of spare parts available locally
compounded by the difficulty In procuring the same through LWSC's cumbersome
purchasing system and procedures; (iii) White Plains Water Treatment Plant: lack of
funds to provide the necessary rehabilitation works whose cost was much higher than
the funds available; and (iv) outstations: limited quantity of tools and spare parts and
insufficient funds to replace old assets.
K. Poject Documentation and Data
33.         The project generated numerous monthly and quarterly progess reports
which were useful in the preparation of this PCR.

\1 Revisions In December 1986 were necessary to bring about the
following changes:
(I) An Increase (to 100%) in the % of expenditures financed for category (3)
to allow financing of LWSC's annual audits which was done by the local
office of an intemational accounting firm.
(ii) Category (4) was deleted to reflect current practice in the Bank, i.e.
funds were advanced to the special account without reference to a
specific category as disbursements were ultimately charged to the
appropriate category when the account got replenished.
(iii)Category (5) was reduced to reflect the actual amount of the PPF refinancing.
\,2 Based on exchange rate prevailing at March 21, 1991, which would
not necessarily match the total in Annex Table 5 which was calculated
based on the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of disbursement.
