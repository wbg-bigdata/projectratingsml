FOR THE SAN LORENZO IRRIrGATION PROIJECT
1.        I submit the following resort and recommendation on a pro-
posed loan of an amount in various currencies equivalent to "$ll million
to the Republic of Peru. The loan would help finance the Third Stage
of the San Lorenzo Project consisting of the reclamation, irrigation

North-Vestern Peru.
PART I - PfRODUCTION
2.        In response to the request of the Peruvian Government, a Bank
mission visited the San Lorenzo Project Area in September-October, 1964
to appraise the project. The background of the Peruvi&n Government
request and the history of the execution of Stages I and II of the
project are described briefly in paragraph 7 below.
3.        Negotiations for the loan began in Vashington on March 9, 1965.
The Government and the San Lorenzo Management were represented by
Mr. Renato Rossi, Director of the San Lorenzo Project.
1.        The proposed loan would increase the total of Bank loans to
Peru from $123.3 million to 113h.3 million net of cancellations. The
status of previous Bank loans as of February 28, 1965 is summarized
as follows:

5.        The total outstanding includes $22.4 million undisbursed as
of February 28, 1965. On the whole, loan disbursements have been pro-
ceeding regularly. There are four loans, however, which have been
affected by difficulties of various kinds.
(i) the largest portion of the undisbursed amount of $22.4
million is represented by the balance available to Lima Light
and Power Company under the loan made in November 1963 for
the construction of the Second Stage of the Huinco Power Plant.
The works have been delayed by about one year but are now pro-
ceeding satisfactorily;
(ii) an amount of $2.7 million for the reconstruction of the
Aguaytia-PucalLpa Road is still to be disbursed. Terrain
difficulties and adverse weather conditions have delayed the
project by two years; it is now rescheduled for completion
by the end of 1966;
(iii) major delays have occurred in the execution of the Port
of Callao expansion project owing to unforeseen physical
obstacles and lack of coordination of the work of the Port
Authority, consultants and contractors' consortium. The clos-
ing date of the loan of December 31, 1964 has now expired.
The Bank has informed the Government of Peru and the Port
Authority that a revised closing date will be considered
after a new overall work schedule and cash flow are worked
out and agreed by the parties concerned and that financing
of the local expenditure for the project is assured. In
the meantime, disbursements would be made only for certain
works which are proceeding normally;

(iv) contrary to the three cases mentioned above, the
Peruvian Corporation Project is being carried out on schedule
and most of the balance of the loan will be used to pay for
equipment already ordered from the manufacturers. However,
in spite of the benefits which the Corporation is now begin-
ning to enjoy as a result of the rehabilitation of the railroad,
the Corporation is in a difficult financial position and had
to ask for a moratorium - which was granted - for the payment
of the October 1, 1964 installment on the Eximbank loans. The
Bank is not immediately involved as the first principal repay-
ment is not due to the Bank until December 1, 1967 and the first
cash payment of interest is expected on December 1, 1965. While
traffic is increasing substantially, the Corporation's finan-
cial position has deteriorated because of wage increases which
could not be matched with an adequate increase in tariffs.
Competition by road carriers is very keen for certain types
of traffic.
A financial reorganization plan is now being studied by the
Government and the Corporation, which is expected to be sub-
mitted to the Bank and Eximbank by N1ay 1965. As a first step
toward a more normal relationship with the long-term creditors,
the Corporation, with financial assistance from the Government,
cleared on April 1, 1965 its arrears with Eximbank.

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        A detailed appraisal report of the project TO-466a is attached
hereto. The San Lorenzo Irrigation and Land Settlement Project is the
Third Stage of a development scheme in the Piura Valley in North-West
Peru. The First Stage consisted of water diversion and irrigation works
to sunplement the water availability of the Piura Valley.   It was com-
pleted in 1953 at a cost of $7.5 million, entirely borne by the Govern-
ment. The Second Stage consisted of the building of a dam, a water
reservoir for 250 million cubic meters, and a system of canals. The
Bank made an $18 million loan in 1955 to cover the foreign exchange
cost of engineering and construction of that Stage, which was completed
in 1959 at a total cost of "'26.6 million. The settlement of 14,3CO
hectares of projeet lands has been completed since that time.
8.        The Third Stage, to be carried out in three years at a total
cost of $30.4 million, would permit the further settlement of 17,700
hectares of irrigated land and the further improvement of the 1h,300
hectares already settled, bringing the total settlement area in San
Lorenzo to about 32,000 hectares. The Third Stage would include equip-
ment, facilities, consulting services and credit to enable the settlers
in the Droject area to develop their farms in the most economical and
balanced way.  The project Tould also include studies - and appropriate
works - to relieve the conditions of poor drainage and salinity which
threaten to affect the San Lorenzo Development Area. Furthermore, the
loan would provide funds to finance the cost of a basin resources study
as it has become more and more evident that a basin program is needed
to assess, on a regional rather than on a piecemeal basis, the water and
related resources in the region and to chart the imnlementation of a
soumd program for their utilization.
Arrangements for Financing
9.        The total cost of the proposed Third Stage of San Lorenzo -
$30.4 million - would be financed by the proposed Bank loan of $11
million, by a $3.3 million AID line of credit and by $16.1 million
contribution by the Peruvian sources (Government 89.4 million, and
settlers $6.7 million). On this basis, about 47% of the total cost
would be financed externally and 53% would be supDlied by Peru. Were
we to take into consideration the three stages of the San Lorenzo
development, the overall split between external and internal financing
would be about the same. About $2l.2 million, or about 80% of the
total cost of the project, would be local currency cost and the balance
of about $6.2 million for import items. The Bank loan would cover the
whole foreign exchange component and about 20% of the Droject's local
currency costs.



10.       As indicated in the cash flow for the overall San Lorenzo
Project attached to the Appraisal Report, San Lorenzo will become
financially self sufficient only in 1971. In the meanwhile, the
Government will provide not only $9.1h million toward the cost of the
Third Stage, but also $9,6 million to meet the loan repayments falling
due on the 1955 Bank loan on the project.
Procurement
11.       All civil works contracts and all contracts for procurement
of equipment and services in excess of 50,000 equivalent will be
awarded on the basis of international comnetitive bidding. Purchases
by the farmers under the agricultural credit program will be made on
local markets where most of the major international suppliers are
represented.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS
12.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the
Bank is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
13.       This draft Loan Agreement is in the usual form.   The following
provisions are of special interest:
a)   Section 5.01 (c) provides that the operating policies and
procedures for the carrying out of the project shall be
agreed upon from time to time between the Borrower, the
Bank and the San Lorenzo Management, and that the Borrower
shall ensure at all times that said operating policies are
daly carried out.
b)   Section 5.01 (d) provides that the Borrower shall cause
consultants acceptable to the Bank to be employed by the
San Lorenzo Management, to an extent and upon terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank and the San Lorenzo
Management, to assist in carrying out the project. The
consultants to assist in the carrying out of the basin
resources study shall be employed directly, however, by
the Peruvian Government.
c)   Section 5.04 (a) provides that until the total amount of
the loan shall have been withdrawn from the Loan Account,
the Borrower shall notify the Bank of any proposal to
appoint a Director of the San Lorenzo Management, and shall
not make such appointment unless the qualifications and
experience of the proposed candidate are acceptable to the
Bank.



- 7 -
d)   In Section 5.0ol (b) it is stioulated that the Decrees
establishin!. the powers of the Director of the San
Lorenzo lIanagement sllall be amended or abrogated cnly
by agreement between the Borrower and the Bank.
e)   Section 8.01 provides, ns an additional condition of
effectiveness, that thie Borrower shall have entered into
an agreement with the Banco de Fomento Agropecuar½o del
Peru, satisfactory to the 3ank, providing for the partic-
ipation of the said Banco in the implementation of the
agricultural credit program included in the project.
PART V - ECONOMIC SITUATION
14.       A Bank mission was in Peru in the fall of 1964 to prepare a
report on the economic situation and outlook- of Peru.  Its report was
circulated to the Executive Directors on 1!,arch 3, 1965 (R 65-32).
150       The report concludes that the prospects of continuing economic
growth by Peru at a rate well above that of pojulation increase are
good. Production for exoort is increasing and the balance of payments
outlook is favorable.  The Government is pursuing bas-cally sou)nd
financial policies, while endeavouring to accelerate public investment
and im-rove its standards. The levels of external debt service are
not now excessive and they leave room for substantial new borrowing by
Peru for investment in high priority projects.
16.       A Bank mission is now review;ng in Peru the level and scope
of the Goveriment's investment expenditure plans for the next few
years and the way s in which the Government intends to finance these
exoerditures.  The mission's findings should be available to the
Executive Directors later this year.
PART VI - CO0HPLIAINCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
17.       I am satisfied that the oroposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOQN'lUENDATION
18.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:



RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to the Republic of Peru,
in an amount in various currencies eouivalent to eleven
million United States dollars ($11,000,000), to mature on
and prior to April 15, 1985, to bear interest at the rate
of five and one-half per cent (5 ) per annum, and to be
upon such other terms and conditions as shall be substan-
tially in accordance wyith the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Loar Agreement (San Lorenzo Project)
between the R:epubl4c of Peru and the Bank, which has been
presented to this meeting.
