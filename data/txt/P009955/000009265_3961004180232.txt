MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPN.JENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR AN UTrAR PRADESH BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         The fellowing memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to India is submitted
for approval. The credit, for SDR 116.5 million (US$165 million equivalent), would be on standard IDA
terms with 35 years maturity. The credit would help finance a Basic Education Project in Uttar Pradesh.
The proceeds of the credit would be passed by the Government of India (GO) to Uttar Pradesh State in
accordance with the Borrower's standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the States of India.
2.         Country/etor Background. In India, low levels of literacy (male - 64%; female - 39%)
reduce labor productivity and eonstrain health, nutrition 3nd the use of family planning services.
Although all children reportedly begin primary schooling, at least 40% of boys and 50% of girls dropout
before acquiring basic literacy skills. In Uttar Pradesh and five other large states, enrollments are below
and dropout rates above nation2l averages. In half of the districts ot these states, 70% or more of girl
students leave school without having learned to read and write.
3.         Low literacy in Uttar Pradesh is the result of extremely weak state basic education programs
that have not been able to deliver services of sufficient quality to offset private costs and the indifference
of illiterate parents, or to provide access to basic education for all children. Strengthening basic
education in Uttar Pradesh will require improved financing and sustained efforts to overcome fundamental
institutional constraints. Although recent trends show that elementary education is receiving a larger
share of a growing State Plan budget, per capita expenditures on elementary education in 1989-90 were
only 60 percent of the national average. Institutional capacity at the state-level for policy development
and implementation, for teacher training and supervision, for curriculum and textbook development, for
school and system management, and for monitoring and research remains undeveloped relative to the task
of improving the quality and equity of the system over the medium term. Management and planning
capacity at the district and community level, while adequate for routine program administration, is not
yet sufficient to address the system factors that contribute to high dropout and low levels of learning:
inadequate community participation, weak school management, undeveloped in-service training, poor
teacher attendance, and inappropriate methods of instruction.
4.         The Government of India (GOI) and the states have agreed on policy changes that would
enhance the cost-effectiveness of basic education: (a) targeting basic education resources on low-literacy
districts; (b) decentralizing responsibility for planning and management to districts to facilitate
identification of and attack on local constraints; and (c) increasing substantially state and GOI investment
resources for basic education development. Girls and minorities would be priority beneficiaries.
5.         The Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) began to expedite the development of Basic
Education in 1987. It now hopes to move toward a 10-15 year program for the development of basic
education that features, in addition to national policy elements, substantial attention to state-level
institutional development. The GOI has thus requested IDA assistance for an education project that would
be a key step in increasing investment in basic education, and which would help develop the State, district
and community-level institutional capacity needed to sustain the development of basic education in the
State over the longer term.
6.         Lessons of Experience. This first IDA investment in basic education in India incorporates
lessons learned from past and ongoing IDA social sector investments. These include the crucial
importance of (a) building institutional capacity, (b) detailed preparation of civil works, procurement and



-2 -
disbursement procedures, (c) Bank supervision, and (d) the importance of working at both the State and
the district levels. Lessons incorporated from IDA basic education investments in other South Asian
countries, from other donor assisted projects in India, and from the State's own experience include the
importance of community mobilization and participation, the viability of community school constructdon
if properly supervised, the value of early childhood education, the need for increasing ihe proportion of
female teachers and providing scholarships for poor girls, the need to improve learning materials and
teacher performance, and the importance of achieving at least an acceptable minimum level of learning
from students.
7.         IDA Strategy and Rationale for Involvement. Pronmting economic reform, speeding
economic growth and alleviating poverty are central to IDA's country strategy for India. Human resource
development is a key element of this oveWl strategy, and education development central for strengthening
human resources. IDA's human r *sources strategy aims to improve the access of the poor to investments
in human resource development and to improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of those
investments. The recently approved Structural Adjustment Credit for a Social Safety Net (SSN,
establishes an improved policy framework and enhanced financial allocations for the human resource
sectors. This will be complemented by specific investment projects in health, nutrition, family welfare
and basic education. IDA's strategy for education is to focus medium-term assistance exclusively on
basic education, given its underdeveloped status in India, its higbi returns, and its importance to the poor.
Over the last several years IDA has advanced the analytic underpinnings of its education work through
analyses of education finance, policy development, trends in enrollment, education for women and girls,
and factors that determine student learning achievement in primary schools. The analytical base has been
strengthened by studies undertaken by national institutions. Based on this work, and on both national and
statespecific seminars and workshops, IDA has entered into a dialogue leading to the development of a
series of specific investment operations to support basic education, of which the proposed project in Uttar
Pradesh is the first. Preparation for additional basic education projects targeted to districts with below
average femnale literacy is underway in six additional states. IDA assistance to basic education in Uttar
Pradesh would provide t'e financing needed for accelerated development in India's largest and one of
India's poorest states, generating lessons to guide subsequent investments in UP and other states. Without
IDA involvement, the pace of development would be considerably slower. In addition, less attention
would be paid to building institutional capacity, to the disadvantaged, to the quality of education, and to
educational outcomes.
8.         Priect Objectve. The proposed project aims to develop the institutional capacity needed
to plan, manage and evaluate basic education development in the state of UP. In addition, the project
seeks in ten project districts to reduce female dropout rates by 50 percent, increase learning achievement
by 50 percent, and provide access to basic education for 600,000 currently unserved students.
9.         Scope and Appoah. The project would support the development of institutional capacity,
at the state, district and local levels. In addition, it would support quality Improvement, higher rates of
completion, and expanded access in 10 of the State's 63 districts. Project districts have been chosen to
represent a range of initial conditions for implementation in keeping with the strategic objective of
generating lessons for wider replication. The average female literacy rate for eight of the districts is 17
percent, well below the state average (26 percent); the two relatively more advanced districts have female
literacy rates of 27 percent. The project would also support project preparation activities in an additional
ten districts, all with .female literacy rates below 15 percent. Resources in UP are highly constrained.
Therefore, the project would focus only on lower and upper primary and non-formal primary education
for the 6-14 age cohort. It would also work extensively to reduce costs through community management
of school construction and rehabilitation.



- 3 -
10.        Proect Dg§gti . lTe three project components would be: (a) Building Institution
Capaciy. At the state-level, the project would support (i) the strengthening of the UP Education for All
Project Board (EFAPB) as well as the capacity of the UP Directore of Basic Education to manage and
monitor the project and the state-wide basic education development program, and (ii) capacity building
for state planning, training and research institutions; (b) Improvinig Oualibt and Completin. These
objectives would be addressed through early childhood education, introductior of revised gender-sensitive
curricula and improved textbooks, increasing the proportion of female teachers, in-service teacher
training, targeted mobilization programs for women and scholarships for girls, strengthened community
control ant school management, and facilit1es improvements, including latrines and drinking water
supply; and (c) Impring Ass. Access to primary and upper primary schooling (which together
comprise elementary education) would be increased through a program of community school construction.
Half of new upper primary places would be in single-sex schools for gids. New schools would be staffed
from the current backlog of 30,000 trained but unemployed teachers. Based on evaluations, nonformal
primary education would be re-designed and expanded.
11.        Poect CosLt. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$193.9 million equivalent.
The net of tax cost of the project would be US$190.7 mill on of which the credit of about US$165 million
would finance 87 percent. The GOUP would finance the remaining project cost of US$25.7 million
equivalent and all taxes. IDA would finance civil works, funiture, equipment, educational materials and
supplies, incremental salaries on a declining basis, training and professional services, scholarships for
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) girls, and project policy, planning and evaluation studies.
Credit proceeds would be provided from the GOI to the GOUP under established procedures for
developmenta assistance to the states of India. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$0.7 million would be provided for eligible
expenditures after March 31, 1993. Amounts and methods of procutement and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11746-IN,
dated May 20, 1993, is being distributed separately.
12.        Eriect nDemetaton. The project would be implemented by the UP Department of
Education. This would be strengthened through the establismet of the Education for All Project Board
(EFAPB), which would be responsible for day-to-day project management. To ensure high level
decision-making support, the EFAPB has a Council chaired by the Chief Minister and consistir;g of
GOUP ministers and senior secretaries, senior GOI representatives, teacher and citizen representatiNes,
and NGO representatives. The Director, Basic Education, GOUP would be ex offliio Project Director.
At the district level, the project would be Implemented by District Education Project Committees
(DEPCs) incorporating senior GOUP district staff. At the village level, Village Education Committees
(VECs) would be financed and trained to manage school constuction and rehabilitation with technical
assistance from District teams) as well as the day-to-day operatlon of schools and nonformal education
programs. A comprehensive project monitoring system would be established in the offices of the
EFAPB. District level planning, management and monitoring teams would be appointed and trained.
Various implementation organizations would be funded on the basis of annual work plans and budgets,
with annual reviews of performance being the criteria for future funding.
13.       EPiect Su. inabili y. The investment costs of the project for the first four years, or the
remainder of the Eighth Five Year Pian, would be approximately US$100 million, representing about 35
percent of the total provisional Eighth Plan investment in elementary education in UP. The balance of
project investmens would be assumed under the Ninth Plan.



-4-
14.        The project would incorporate a number of measures designed to reduce the liabilities on
state recurrent budgets, including deputation and limited term contracts for managerial staff and low-cost
community school construction. Preliminary costing puts the annual recurrent cost burden of the project
at US$15 million in the seventh year, including contingencies. This would be 4.5 percent of 1992 State
recurrent expenditures on elementary education and 0.5 percent of total State recurrent expenditure in
1992. If recurrent expenditure on elementary education were to grow at 5 percent per year, the annual
recurrent cost burden of the project in the year 2000 would be equal to 3.2 percent of the recurrent
expenditures on elementary education, 1.7 percent of total recurrent expenditures for education, and 0.3
percent of total State recurrent expenditures in that year. This number is small enough thae UP should
be able over seven years to meet tfie recurrent cost burden of the project, even in a highly constrained
environment, by improved efficiencies and intra-sectoral shifts, as it has been making.
15.        Agreements Reached. During negotiations, the GOUP provided assurances that it would:
(a) appoint key staff to the EFA Project Board by December 31, 1993; (b) establish by January 31, 1994
and thereafter maintain the State Institute of Educational Management and Training (SIEMT) with
adequate full-time staff, other resources and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; (c) prepare a draft
state-wide pian for basic education reform by mid-project review; (d) appoint iey staff for all District
Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) by January 31, 1994 and complete staffing by June 30,
1994; (e) carry out student assessments in project districts during the first (by December 31, 1994), third
(1996) and sixth (1999) year of the project and discuss the results with IDA; (t) complete evaluations of
VEC effectiveness annually for discussion with IDA; (g) complete a study of factors, including incentives,
that cot tribute to the willingness of teachers to accept and persist in posts in rural schools, and to discuss
the results with IDA at mid-term review by October, 1996; (h) monitor the appointment of female VEC
members (ensuring that at least one woman would be a member of each VEC) and female teachers and
discuss the results with IDA annually by January 31 of each year; (i) maintain the autonomy and national
program guidelines of Mahila Samakhya In the program in Uttar Pradesh through the life of the project;
d) provide an annual report on community school construction to IDA by January 31 of each year; (k)
conduct evaluations of the introduction of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), the scholarship
program for Scheduled Caste girls, the girls' work experience program, and the non-formal primary
education program, and the educational needs of Scheduled Tribe children for discussion with IDA at
mid-term review in October, 1996; (!) provide annual work plans and budgets for all Cooperating
Agencies (CAs) to IDA by December 31 of each year; and (m) select non-governmental organizations
participating in the project in accordance with criteria and procedures satisfactory to the Association.
There would be no special conditions of project effectiveness.
16.       EPoes Benefits. The project would be a first investment in a longer-term program to
improve the level of literacy among the citizens of UP, and hence their productivity and social welfare.
It would create an institutional framework for cost-effective policy implementation in basic education, and
generate lessons for wider national use. In addition, by the end of the project, reduced dropout rates,
especially for girls, would enable an estimated additional 1 million students to complete their education,
acquiring basic literacy and numeracy skills, with the attendant benefits that go with this. More than
450,000 currently unserved students also would have access to the benefits of improved primary or upper
primary education services and more than 350,000 boys and girls are expected to benefit from non-formal
education.
17.        PrThram Objective Categories. 'Me project would contribute to poverty alleviation by
establishing the institutional capacity for a sustained state program and by improving basic education
outcomes in ten districts. Beneficiaries of the project would overwhelmingly be poor children. However,
there is special focus on girls and Scheduled Caste students, through strategies to reduce primary
dropouts, increase access to formal schooling and expand improved nonformal edvWation. In project



.-5
districts the project would Increase the gross enrollment rat (GER) for al! girls from about 30 to about
65 percent and for Scheduled Caste girls from about 40 to about 70 percent at the primary level. At the
upper primary level, the project would increase the GER for all girls from about 30 to about 65 percent,
for Scheduled Caste girls from about 10 to over 20 percent and for Scheduled Caste boys from 32 to over
40 percent. In all the total uumber of poor children who would benefit from the project is estimated at
about 1.8 million. In addition, vomen would also gain about 1S,000jobs as teachers. IdigmnogsPe.ogF
(Scheduled Tribes) would be about 0.2 percent of the project benficiaries. The project would finance
a study of their particular educational needs, a pilot of appropriate intervendons, and an evaluation of the
pilot. Benef,ciM gMtcjp%n would be a major part of the project activities, focused on the Village
Education Committee. NGOs would participate as cooperating implemeatg agencies. The project does
6      ~~not raise any envirnetl  }-es
18.       Bska. The project faces financial and implementadon risks, as well as tue risks inherent
in the social and organizational change elements of the project strategy. U.P. faces severe financial
constraints, and in the last two years positive trends in the growth of State financing for basic education
have slowed. Project implementation in U.P. has encountered delays due to rigid bureaucratic
management and interruptions in the flow of funds. In promoting community participation, building
institutional capacity, and seeking to sharply improve access to educational benefits for girls and
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe students, the project will encounter a range of behavioral and attitudinal
barriers to change.
19.       To offset financial risks, the project would Include close monitoring of state budgets and
expenditures and, for the longer term, support the preparaion of a state-wide plan and financing strategy
for the further development of basic education. Implementation risks have been addressed through
extensive participation in project preparation, through earmarked project financing and a mechanism for
advance funding, and through the planned development of monitoring, management and research capacity.
20.        However, project authorities recognize that all risks cann  be dealt with through analysis
and design, especially for innovative programs in uncertai environments. The project management
structure has thus been consciously designed for risk managemen  The EFAPB has access to the highest
level of decision making within the State and the G01. The anul planning and budgeting cycle
managed by the EFAPB gives all parties a voice in the process of implementation, and provides an
opportunity to identify and reinforce at points of weakness, to shift resources among project components,
or even to shift resources to other districts. The annual cycle would be reinforced by a substantive mid-
term review, at which specified studies and evaluations would be considered. These mechanisms would
be especially important in managing Implementation risks and the risks associated with social and
organizational change, all areas of endeavor with high degrees of Innovation and little prior experience
to use as a guide.
21.        Recommendatio. I am satisfled that the proposed credit would comply with the Aricles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
