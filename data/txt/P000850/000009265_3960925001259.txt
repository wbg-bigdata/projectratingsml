PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA - NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK (NIB) PROJECT
(Loan 1180-GH)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) relates to Bank Loan 1180-Gi
of US$10 million to the National Investment Bank (NIB), for financing the
foreign exchange cost of projects in manufacturing, agri-business and
tourism. The project was approved by the Board on December 11, 1975 and
declared effective on March 2, 1976. Although the loan was fully committed
by the original terminal date (December 31, 1979) for subproject
submission, the closing date was extended four times from December 31, 1981
to June 30, 1984, due to delays in subproject implementation resulting from
country difficulties.
A second line of credit (901-GH) for US$19 million was approved
by IDA in May 1979 and became effective in May 1980. This credit is now
about 98% committed and about 96% disbursed. The date for final
disbursement was July 10, 1986.
This PCR was prepared by the West Africa Projects Department,
based upon the findings in March 1985, data provided by NIB in November
1985, and a detailed review and analysis of the proj^^t files.
Comments on this PCR have been received from the National
Investment Bank and the Bank of Ghana and are part of the PCR, as
Attachments A and B.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NATIONAIL INVESTMENT BANK (NIB) PROJECT
Loan 1180-GH
HIGHLIGHTS
Project Objectives and Background
The National Investment Bank (NIB) was the recipient of the $10
million loan, the main objectives of which were to:
(a) provide NIB with a portion of the foreign exchange
needed to finance viable (mainly small and medium)
enterprises, and support NIB's efforts to mobilize
other external resources;
(b) further strengthen NIB's institutional capabilities,
particularly in project appraisal, investment supervision
and loan recovery; and
(c) harmonize NIB's policies with the government's
industrial priorities.
The loan was approved by the Board in December 1975, became
effective in March 1976 and was closed in June 1983.
The environment in which the project was implemented changed
drastically during the period 1975-83, as Ghana experienced a period of
unprecedented economic, financial and political turmoil (see paras 2.05,
2.15). This delayed project implementation by creating an atmosphere of
uncertainty, thereby reducing demand for investments; forcing a number of
enterprises to go out of business; and reducing the profitability of the
corporate sector and, hence, its capacity to service debt. These
developments nave had an adverse impact upon the financial status and
performance of NIB.
Project Implementation
Project implementation was comparatively timely, with commitments
progressing as forecast. Utilization of the line of credit commenced
immediately following effectiveness: a total of US$3.24 million equivalent
was committed to 10 subprojects in 1976. By the original terminal date
(December 31, 1979) for the submission of subprojects, NIB had committed
almost the entire amount of the loan (US$9.9 million or 99%) to 28
subprojects, with the remainder of US$100,000 earmarked for exchange rate
fluctuations (para 4.03).
Actual disbursements were slower than appraisal expectations due
to problems in the country, and resulting implementation delays. The loan's
closing date had to be extended three times from the original date of



- v -
December 31, 1981 to June 30, 1983 'see para 4.04 on country economic
problems). During the period of the third extension, and at NIB's request,
unutilized balances totalling US$211,500 that were no longer required on 11
subprojects were reallocated to another previously-approved subproject.
The loan was fully disbursed 18 months after the closing date, however, a
noteworthy achievement considering the difficult country economic
conditions during the period.
The results of the project were mixed. As regards the first
objective, namely the transfer of IBRD foreign exchange resources to
finance investments through NIB, the project achieved generally
satisfactory results. The majority of the subprojects in the sample of 17
provided proved to be viable, with actual financial rates of return
exceeding 17%. Six of the subprojects showed returns exceeding appraisal
estimates, while three reported negative returns. In terms of economic
performance, 13 subprojects reported viable operations, of which 5 had
actual returns above appraisal estimates. Of the remaining subprojects in
the sample, one had a negative rate of return and 3 provided no actual
data (see para 4.12). About 1,926 jobs were created by the sample projects
(compared with 1,733 estimated) at an average investment cost per job of
about US$20,000 (see para 4.14). It can thus be concluded that the
onlending aspect of the project was fairly successful.
In terms of facilitating NIB's mobilization of external
resources, however, the results were less satisfactory: following approval
of the line of credit in December 1975, NIB was able to raise only one
external project-specific loan (Nasia Rice-- $25 million in 1977 from the
ADB), followed by a $25 million IDA/EEC credit in 1979. The Bank/IDA
support and the ADB loan in 1985 have accounted for about 90% of NIB's
total external resources. Thus, there has virtually been no mobilization
of foreign resources from the market. This problem may be attributable
largely to the difficult economic and political conditions prevailing in
the countrv during the period autd their influence on creditworthiness
conditions.
The project's institution-building objectives, particularly in
the areas of investment supervision, loan recovery and general accounting,
were not realized. NIB's supervision has remained ineffective, and almost
non-existent, loan recovery is low as arrears continue to mount, and
accounting reports are frequently delayed and generally of questionable
reliability (see paras 3.14, 4.08, 4.09, 5.01). These problems were to a
certain degree attributable to the discontinuity in NIB's senior
management, especially in the post of Managing Director (see paras 3.06 -
3.07).
The institution and its staff have withstood the test uf time
reasonably well, however, despite frequent changes in top management and
the loss of a number of qualified staff. With the aid of a new and
experienced senior adviser, who will also have line responsibllity for
finance and administration, and the adoption of an Action Plan soon to be
agreed upon by the Bank and NIB, some noticeable improvements are expected.



- vi -
Now that the recent Bank-initiated financial restrueturing of NIB
is substantially completed (see para 3.19), the prospects are promising in
the medium- to long-term for a more financially viable institution. NIB is
now seeking new, preferably foreign development-oriented investors. This
effort is not sufficient in itself, however, to assure NIB's future. Given
the drastically changed economic environment over the past few years (as
well as the prospects for future changes), a first prioritv for NIB's
management should be the adoption of a detailed action plan of         dial
measures and a business strategy to guide the institution over tne next
years.
The third main objective of the project, the harmonization of
NIB's policies with the Government's industrial priorities, was not
realized since, for all practical purposes, there was no effective
industrial sector policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government
during the 1975-83 period, nor was there any indication of NIB's
contribution to the formulation of sector policies, as was expected in the
appraisal report (see para 5.10). The absence of a Government-Bank policy
dialogue was understandable as the country situation until 1983 precluded
any such meaningful dialogue. It is also noteworthy that while the
appraisal report mentioned NIB's future policy contributions among the
project's objectives, the project itself did not provide for any specific
arrangement to develop NIB's capability in this regard.
The project's economic impact, although less than expected, was
satisfactory. Financial performance of the sub-projects was also fairly
good, as evidenced by the fact that 16 out of the 28 assisted subproiects
have already been fully repaid. Another 6 are repaying though irregularly
and the remaining 6 subprojects are non-performing loans (see para 4.15).
This record is better than NIB's overall portfolio performance, and taken
against the background of the difficult economic environment at the time,
represents a signiificant ach4evement.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
As previously noted, NIB's problems were compounded by a
discontinuity in management in addition to economic difficulties and
uncertainties. The Bank should have forcefully opposed frequent and
disruptlve senior management changes at NIB although, given the political
turmoil in the country during that period, it is not clear to what extent
such efforts would have been successful.
NIB's financial condition deteriorated seriously due to a decline
in the quality of its loan portfolio; this was in turn the result of the
severe economic deterioration in Ghana from 1978 to 1983, from which the
country is only now recovering, and of ineffective loan supervision and
collection efforts (see paras 3.15 - 3.16). Despite these macro-economic
problems in the country, however, a more organized and vigilant loan
supervision and recovery program would probably have reduced NIB's high
arrears.



- vii -
NIB's largely inadvertent exposure to foreign exchange risks in a
country experiencing massive devaluations resulted primarily from its
management error and inadequate attention by the Bank to this issue during
appraisal and even thereafter (see para 4.06). The Banl, should have also
prevented the DFC from assuming exchange risks (directly or indirectly) on
any of its external borrowings, in addition to its loan covenant against
the assumption of exchange risks by NIB on Its sub-loans (see para 5.13).
If this provision had been adopted and closely monitored during supervision
of NIB, the situation in which NIB found itself in 1984 could have been
avoided.
In retrospect, it is clear that the Bank staff should have paid
more attention to systems and procedures in NIB to monitor the quality and
performance of its loan portfolio, to the effects of massive devaluations
on NIB capital and loan portfolio, and to the quality and timeliness of
audits.
As NIB's contribution to policy-making for the industrial sector
(an explicit project objective) never materialized, experience under the
project (as elsewhere) would ineicate that whatever the economic
environment, DFCs and DFC projects are not generally an effective
instrument for achieving policy reforms (see para 5.10).
Since 1984 the Bank has undertaken significant initiatives, in
particular in providing assistance in the financial restructuring exercise
of NIB, in the detailed assessment of the quality of its loan portfolio,
and in strengthening of NIB's systems and procedures and management (see
para 3.16 - 3.18). The Bank should continue these efforts and its
intensive supervision of NIB even after closing of the second NIB loan in
June 1986, and even in the absence of new lending to NIB, in order to
ensure sustainability of the cumulative efforts at institution building.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the Bank's policy dialogue with
the Government, an objective which was unrealized during the project
implementation period 1975-83, was achieved after its closure. The
dialogue intensified from 1983 at both the macroeconomic and industrial
sector levels, leading to a comprehensive set of industrial and trade
policy reforms contained in the Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit
approved in -.arch 1986.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NATIONATL INVESTMENT BANK (NIB) PROJECT
Loan 1180-GH
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project was the first IBRD loan to the National Investment
Bank (NIB), an institution established in 1963 and owned substantially by
the Government and Bank of Ghana (combined holdings of 81%). Substantive
discussions on the loan began in 1973, followed by appraisal and Board
approval in 1975. At the time of appraisal, NIB was (and still is) the
principal source of ter:n financing, providir.g assistance to all sectors of
the economy by granting loans, making equity investments, underwriting
shares and issuing guarantees.
1.02      The loan's main objective was two-fold: (a) to provide NIB with
part of its foreign exchange needs, thereby helping to attract other
foreign resources for financing viable (mainly small and medium)
enterprises; and (b) to further strengthen NIB's institutional capabili-
ties, particularly in the areas of investment supervision and loan
recovery. It was further hoped that the discussions and shaping of NIB's
policies would lead to an ongoing dialogue with the Government on its
industrial policies.
II.  THE ENVIRONMENT
A. Economic Background
2.01      During the project implementation period, Ghana's GDP, which had
remained almost stagnant up to 1978, declined by an average of 2% per
annum. As a consequence, and given the country's high population growth
rate (estimated at 2.9%), the average real income per capita was estimated
in 1982 at about US$360, or two-thirds of its level a decade earlier. The
country's basic needs indicators were hardly better than those of other
low-income Sub-Sahara African countries. Despite the growth in health and
education facilities, a large portion of the population was without access
to safe water and formal education. Most of the decline was attributable
to the agricultural sector, particularly food and cocoa, and to industry.
Nearly all basic goods and services were in short supply during the early
1980s.
2.02      The structure of the economy changed markedly during the period.
A dramatic shift occurred from the productive sectors, such as agriculture
and manufacturing, to trade and services. The share of services in GDP
increased from about 31% in 1975 to 36% in 1984. Agriculture's share in



- 2 -
GDP declined in real terms between 1970 and 1975 because of the drop in
cocoa production. Non-cocoa agriculture declined less rapidly than the
other sectors during 1975-84, and the share of food products in GDP
increased, thus maintaining agriculture's relative share of GDP.
Agriculture remained the largest sector of the economy, providing a
livelihood for nearly 70% of the population. Manufacturing and mining
declined from a total of 16% of GDP in the mid-1970s to about 9% in 1984.

2.03      Ghana's balance of payments difficulties of the mid-1970s
intensified in subsequent years. Import capacity was determined
principally by the level of exports, since capital inflows been negligible.
Export earnings, based predominantly on cocoa and to a lesser extent on
timber, gold and diamonds, all experienced a sharp downward trend. Capital
flows and official aid had almost stopped until 1983/84 because of
continued political uncertainties, accumulation of large commercial
arrears, lack of creditworthiness, and the failure to adjust macroeconomic
policies.
2.04      The poor state of public finances contributed significantly to
the deterioration of the economic situation. Persistent large budgetary
deficits were financed mainly by domestic borrowings, resulting in sharp
increases in the money supply and, in turn, inflationary pressures. The
deficits were the result of rapidly growing expenditures at a time when
revenues were declining sharply in real terms. Recurrent expenditures were
still insufficient, however, to maintain existing public assets in the



agriculture, mining and manufacturing industries, or to sustain
infrastructures,
2.05      The rapid decay of the economy resulted from a combination of
domestic economic policies and adverse external events, e.g., the decline
in world prices of cocoa and mining commodities. On the domestic front,
large government deficits led to accelerating rates of inflation and
further overvaluation of the nominal exchange rate. The growing exchange
rate distortion created a major disincentive for exports and contributed to
the shift from production to black market and trading activities, where
profits were large and relatively quickly realized. Past economic policies
had also been characterized by declining real producer prices to
agriculture, especially export commodities; high protection against imports
of final goods in order to foster import substitution; greater reliance on
admlnistered allocative mechanisms than on relative prices; an
over-extension of the parastatal sector that heavily burdened the
government budget; and negative real interest rates that reduced domestic
savings and favored capital-intensive investment.   Declining export
revenues were also attributable to declining volume of exports (especially
cocoa) due to low producer prices and to some extent to smuggling of
exports to neighboring countries. Finally, droughts during 1982-83
resulted in a loss of at least US$130 million in foreign exchange earnings.
2.06      In 1983, the government introduced an Economic Recovery Program
(ERP) in order to remove the serious cost/price distortions prevailing in
the economy and to realign relative prices in favor of productive sectors,
especially tradJtional exports, i.e., cocoa, timber, gold and diamonds.
The main elements of the ERP included substantial adjustments in the
foreign exchange rate, simplification of the customs tariff structure,
establishment of realistic relative prices and income (e.g., increases in
producer prices of cocoa, tobacco and cotton), removal of price controls on
all but eight commodities, a flexible interest rate policy, wage
adjustments, restoration of fiscal discipline, phased reduction in external
arrears, and rehabilitation of key sectors. This stabilization program
represented a significant effort by the government to regain control over
its external and internal financial problems; it gained considerable
financial support from the donor community, including the Bank and the
Fund.
B. The Industrial Sector
2.07      The manufacturing sector covers a wide range of activities.  The
modern sector is dominated by food processing, wood products, textiles,
garments, beverages and cigarettes, which account for about 65% of total
output and 74% of total employment in manufacturing (excluding petroleum
refinery). The remainder consists mainly of building materials, household
chemicals, paper, plastic and petroleum products. Ghana's industrial
sector has been characterized during the last decade by declining
production (an average decline of 13% per annum from 1977 to 1982),
declining capacity utilization (from over 50% in the early 1970s to below
25% in the 1980s), and by inefficient and highly import-dependent
investments. These problems are attributable to the limitations of three



- 4 -
major themes of past industrial strategy, namely: (a) emphasis on import
substitution through high levels of effective protection; (b) reliance on
admlnistrative controls rather than on market mechanisms to determine
incentives and resource allocation; (c) reliance on large-scale, public
sector investment as the leading edge of industrial development.
2.08      The emphasis on import substitution was in part a manifestation
of the post-independence drive to reduce economic dependence, and in part
an unintended consequence of balance-of-payments difficulties caused by
rapidly-rising imports and stagnant export earnings. Tariffs and
quantitative restrictions (especially on luxury goods) resulted in high
protection and curtailed imports. The strategy discouraged the growth of
both exports and agriculture, so that foreign exchange earnings failed to
keep pace with the rising demand for imports and the volume of exportable
raw materials did not grow with the capacity of processing industries.
Inefficient and import-dependent industries were also over-protected, and
their high financial returns encouraged the expansion of processing
capacity, despite its under-utilization.
2.09      The capacity expansion, maintained by means of suppliers' credits
despite the foreign exchange shortage, led only to increasing
underutilization and deterioration of capacity in the 1970s and 1980s as
foreign exchange allocations were cut back for both raw materials and spare
parts. Industrial output declined from 14% of GDP in the mid-1970s to
about 8% since 1982 (3% in current prices). The industrial sector, after
having been the motor of economic growth, fell behind.
2.10      As part of the Bank's recent industrial sector work, the overall
efficiency of Ghana's industrial structure and its consistency with the
country's comparative advantage was assessed. The analysis revealed five
major structural weaknesses: (a) import requirements for full capacity
production greatly exceed the amount of foreign exchange likely to be
available for this purpose in the foreseeable future; (b) full capacity
production exceeds the domestic market in some subsectors; (c) processing
capacity often exceeds the availability of local raw materials; (d) direct
public sector holdings exceed what can be effectively and profitably
managed; and (e) a substantial portion of processing capacity is unlikely
to be able to compete with imported goods. The analysis also revealed a
wide gap between actual and potential efficiency. Although two-thirds of
firms surveyed were operating inefficiently in 1983, most would be
efficient if they were operating at, or close to, full capacity. About 40%
of the potential full capacity production is in industries that are
considered consistent with Ghana's comparative advantage. The comparative
advantage is marginal for about 50% of the other industries. These results
indicate that the industrial sector needs to be restructured. The
restructuring process has been initiated under the industrial sector
adjustment credit. At the same time, the analysis shows that a substantial
portion of Ghana's industries is, or can become, viable and sustainable in
a competitive environment.

C. The Financial Sector
2.11      Ghana's financial system is still at an early stage of
development, and is dominated by banking institutions. The banking system,
which is oligopolistic, has been expanding: the number of bank branches has
doubled since 1976 and, with 3.2 branches per 100,000 inhabitants, the
network is quite dense. In addition to the banks, there are a number of
non-bank financial institutions, of which the most important is the Social
Security and National Tnsurance Trust. The proportion of financial assets
held by private savers ln forms other than currency and deposits is small.
A well-organized and active capital market does not yet exist.
2.12      Because of the great scarcity of foreign exchange, which has
adversely affected the operations of most of the banks' manufacturing
clients and catised t1tem to operate at substantially less than economic
levels (20-25% of capacity) and prevented them from servicing their loans,
the banking system is heavily burdened with non-performing loans which the
banks (commercial and specialized) are unable and unwilling to write off
for fear of eroding their already fragile capital base. The system also
continues to suffer a "crisis of confidence" resulting from past measures
taken by various military governments, and a substantial albeit
unquantifiable part of the money supply remains outside official circuits.
The result is that domestic savings are low and a large part of local
business transactions are conducted on the black market.   Adjustment for
the overvalued exchange rate would yield a substantially higher ratio for
1982.
2.13       The money supply (M2) increased from ¢ 3.2 billion to ¢ 33.8
billion between 1977 and 1984, while total domestic credit rose during the
same period from ¢ 4.3 billion to ¢ 42.8 billion, a ten-fold increase. The
nominal growth reflects the inflation rates which reached a peak of 123% in
1983. Taking 1977 prices, and using the consumer price index as an
implicit deflator, the financial system shrank considerably, ,th M
decreasing to e 1.0 billion and domestic credit to e 1.3 billion. in other
words, the 1984 values of the two aggregates were only one third and one
fourth, respectively, of their 1977 values. Except for an interruption in
1982, when the rate of inflation was brought down to a record low of 22%,
this trend continued until 1984, when the money supply and domestic credit
both started to increase in real terms.
2.14      The Central Bank, which financed public sector deficits, was the
primary source of liquidity expansion during most of the 1970s and early
1980s. The resultant rapid increase in money supply, coupled with a
stagnant GDP and a heavily overvalued currency, allowed inflation to
increase from 10% in 1972 to 123% in 1983. This excessive money creation
during a period of seriously depressed investments led to an over-liquid
economy in which banks, for an extended period, refused to accept
interest-bearing deposits. With Central Bank-mandated interest rate
ceilings for savings well below the rate of inflation, and depressed and
unattractive investment opportunities available to the banks, both private
savers and the banks showed a decided preference for short-term deposits.



- 6 -
2.15      A number of ad-hoc monetary measures introduced by the Government
in 1982 further devastated the already low level of confieence in the
banking system. These included (a) the demonetization of the ¢ 50 bank
note; (b) the freezing of all bank accounts exceeding ¢50,000 to allow
investigation for tax liability and possible corruption or fraud; (c) the
recall of bank loans for trade financing; and (d) compulsory payment by
check for all business transactions exceeding ¢ 1,000. Under these
conditions, it obviously became unattractive and unwise to hold financial
assets in Ghana. In response to this situation, many households or
potential savers further reduced their savings and turned to the informal
financial system, thus contributing to a decline in the money supply (M2)
in the formal system and dis-intermediation.
2.16      Generally, the banks had no incentives to attract long-term
resources. Investment opportunities were virtually non-existent, past
Government policies (e.g., price and Cistribution controls and foreign
exchange allocations) made it difficult to assess the risks involved in
term-lending, and lending rates themselves were grossly inadequate to
compensate for these risks. Term rpsources were mainly mobilized by the
three development banks and by the non-bank financial institutions. In
1984, the reported outstanding term debt of the DFCs of about ¢ 1.3 billion
(before adjustments to reflect subsequent devaluations, and accounting for
about 11% of the banking systems' deposits) originated largely from
bilateral and multilateral lenders and to a smaller extent from the
Government.
III. NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK (NIB)
A.  The Institution
3.01      The National Investment Bank was established by an Act of Parlia-
ment in 1963. NIB was the first institution established in Ghana for the
provision of financial assistance to all sectors of the economy, through
the granting of term loans, issuance of guarantees and subscription of
shares. Coupled with its commercial banking activities, which commenced in
April 1975 mainly to serve the banking needs of its term-loan clients, NIB
now provides a fairly wide range of banking services through its four major
branches. Despite the existence of several other term-lending institutions
(e.g., Agriculture Development Bank, Bank for Housing and Construction),
NIB remains Ghena's primary development finance institution.
B.  Ownership and Share Capital
3.02      NIB was established with an authorized share capital of e 20
million.  At the time of project appraisal, a total of e 18 million (90% of
the authorized capital) had been subscribed, of which b   17.1 million was
fully paid. The principal shareholders were the Government of Ghana (83%),
the Bank of Ghana (8.7%) and the Ghana Commercial Bank (3.8%). The balance
of 4.5% was held by two private commercial banks and 75 other private
companies and individuals. In January 1978, the Government authorized an



-7 -
increase in NIB's share capital from V 20 million to V 40 million in the
form of 20 million no par shares. A total of e 39 million (19.5 million
shares) of NIB's capital has been subscribed and fully paid up. The
following is a breakdown of NIB's present shareholders:

3.03      As part of a financial restructuring exercise agreed between the
Government, NIB and the Bank in 1984-85, the Government has agreed to amend
NIB's Act of Establishment to, inter alia, boost its authorized capital to
between 0 1.5 and 02.0 billion (see para 3.16) and to open NIB's capital
and board representation to foreign development-oriented investors.
Meanwhile, as part of this restructuring exercise, and in order to
strengthen NIB's current equity base, the Bank of Ghana (BOG) provided NIB
in May 1985 with a e 880 million interest-free subordinated loan
convertible to share capital upon maturity at NIB's option. Discussions
are also currently underway to induce the aforementioned foreign investors
to subscribe to about US$3.0 million equivalent of NIB's proposed increased
share capital. One potential investor, DEG (the German Development
Company), has already indicated its readiness to subscribe to about DM 1.0
million equivalent.
3.04      The NIB Act provides for a total of seven directors, including
the Managing Director. This provision, which was being applied at the time
of appraisal, has since been contravened by the creation (by the PNDC
Government) in 1983 of an "Interim Management Committee" acting in place of
the board of directors. The committee consists of eleven members, of whom
four are senior NIB staff (including the Managing Director as Chairman),
three represent Government (one each from BOG, Ministrv of Finance and
Ministry of Industries), one represents local shareholders, and three
represent NIB employees. Although NIB is not unique in this situation, and



has managed to minimize the disruptive effect of this interim arrangement,
it has nonetheless been denied the chance to attract capable outside
directors. This arrangement also disregards the right of shareholders to
choose their representatives and violates the provisions of the NIB Act.
In the context of the recent restructuring discussions, the Government has
indicated to the Bank its intention to regularize this situation, a
necessary step to attract foreign investors. As the Government and BOG
will probably continue to hold at least two-thirds of NIB's shares, the
composition of NIB's board will continue, as originally intended, to have
majority government representation, although other shareholders are
expected to be duly represented.
C. Organization, Managemant and Staff
3.05      Since the appraisal of both the first line of credit (1975) and
the second line of credit (1979), NIB has continued to undergo basic
organizational changes, partly in response to the mass exodus of
professionals from the country in search of better employment opportunities
(para 3.07), and partly because of management's desire to improve
institutional effectiveness. Notable among the changes were the following:
(a) an increase in the number of Area (Regional) Offices from three to five
(Greater Accra, Ashanti/Brong Ahafo, North/Upper, Central/Western and
East/Volta); (b) the establishment of three principal operational units
within NIB (Development Banking, Administration/Finance and Commercial
Banking), each headed by a Director; (c) the re-naming of the former
Development Service Institute (DSI) as the Projects Department; (d) the
establishment of a Loan Recovery Unit within the Finance Department; and
(e) the establishment of two units responsible for loan supervision - one
for the supervision of projects having loans only, and a second unit
responsible for supervising joint-venture projects. Regrettably, neither
of the two units within the Supervision Division has been fully staffed or
is fully operational.  Although a number of these measures wou,d normally
represent steps in the right direction, their implementation has not always
been systematic and consistent and has often been initiated piecemeal
without proper attention to operational, procedural and staff matters. In
a few isolated cases, changes appeared to have been intended either to
favor certain staff or to punish others who had fallen out of favor; hence,
these changes have not yielded real benefits. Furthermore, NIB has
continued over the years to adopt a "top-heavy" management structure
compounded by several administrative layers, resulting in inefficiency and
high overhead. NIB's new Managing Director, at the Bank's urging, is now
planning an in-depth review of NIB's structure with a view to grouping
functions properly, streamlining the organization and enhancing its effec-
tiveness.
3.06      The capable Managing Director of NIB who was in post at the time
of appraisal retired in 1978 after five years of service. For almost six
years thereafter, NIB suffered from a lack of continuity in management and
a leadership void. After three different Managing Directors in less than
six years, a fourth appointed in 1983 died suddenly in an automoblle
accident after serving only about 18 months. In May 1985, a new Managing



- 9 -
Director was appointed to head NIB. He has been growing into his new job
and should in time provide effective leadership.
3.07      As Chief Executive of NIB, the Managing Director is assisted by a
recently appointed Deputy (formerly Director-Finance/Administration) and
three Directors, responsible respectively for Development Banking,
Commercial Banking and Finance/Administration. The position cf Director of
Development Banking has been occupied by an NIB officer with over 23 years
of experience in the institution. NIB's Director of Commercial Banking is
also an experienced and able banker (over 11 years with NIB). The third
Director position (Finance/Administration) has remained vacant since the
promotion of the incumbent to the position of Deputy Managing Director, and
the previous departure of his able assistant who, like many Ghanaian
professionals, left the country in search of better employment opportu-
nities. NIB's Managing Director, with Bank assistance, is in the process
of identifying a suitable expatriate expert to fill this position and also
to serve as Senior Adviser. It should be noted that under the T/A
component of the second line of credit, NIB had sought to strengthen its
institutional capabilities, particularly at the senior level, through the
successive recruitment of two expatriate advisers. Neither one proved
effective, however, and the Bank even had to recommend the removal of the
first adviser. Based upon this experience, every effort is now being made
to assist NIB in the identification and recruitment of an experienced and
proven adviser.
3.08      NIB's professional staff numbers have declined from about 100 at
the time of appraisal in 1975 to a current level of 90. Although NIB still
has a strong core of experienced and competent staff, particularly in its
Projects (formerly DSI) and Research Departments, many of NIB's employees
are young and new recruits. Certain areas of NIB's performance are
therefore weak, notably in the project supervision and accounting
departments, and there is increased need for continued supervision and
on-the-job training. In an effort to strengthen supervision, NIB in 1985
split the supervision department into two units, one responsible only for
the loan portfolio, and the other for joint-venture projects. Although
both of these units appear to be headed by competent individuals, they
nonetheless suffer from inadequate staff (both in numbers and
qualifications) and will likely require intensive on-the-job training and
time before meaningful improvements are noticeable.
3.09      Despite its staff constraints and particularly weak Supervision
and Accounting Departments, NIB has continued to undertake new activities
over the years (e.g., small-scale lending, administration of special
Government-ordered projects (i.e., Nasia Rice), timber sector export
rehabilitation program, etc.), without due consideration to their
operational and financial implications. Although some of these activities
may have been worthwhile, NIB has overburdened its already inadequate
staff. NIB should consider consolidating its operations in the near-term,
possibly phasing out small-scale lending, which requires special attention
and heavy client assistance, and redeploying its staff to such critical
areas as project supervision and loan recovery.



- 10 -
3.10      Despite the loss of professional staff, NIB should perhaps be
credited with having served as a training ground for many of the top local
bankers. Three current Managing Directors of local banks and a number of
senior staff in other financial institutions were employees of NIB at the
time of appraisal. Although it could not have been expected to retain all
its competent staff in any case (particularly in light of the exodus of
professional from the country and the resultant scramble by local
instituitions over the limited number of professionals), NIB will still have
to improve its salary structure and conditions of employment, both of which
are currently less attractive than those of many other institutions with
which NIB must compete for staff.
D. Pclicies and Procedures
3.11      Most of NIB's policies are covered in its by-laws, except its
term debt/equity limit which is set by its Act. Except for a 1984
amendment to the Act (as part of its financial restructuring exercise)
increasing its borrowing lim!ts from 3:1 to 10:1 (with prior Bank approval)
there have been no real cbnnges in NIB's policies since appraisal.
3.12      Between the first appraisal (1975) and second appraisal (1979) of
NIB, the institution made some strides in improving both its appraisal and
project supervision capacities; this improvement was short-lived, however.
NIB's supervision activities suffered further decline due mainly to
the scarcity of qualified staff, inadequate procedures and lack of
sufficient emphasis upon project supervision. The non-existence of
procedures, or their non-observance where they do exist, has also plagued
NIB's accounts department in recent years, contributing to NIB's serious
portfolio problems. NIB will need a complete review, updating and
documentation of its procedures in order to improve its operational
capabilities and effectiveness. NIB is partly addressing this problem with
assistance from the senior adviser (financed from technical assistance
funds reallocated by government under Credit 901-GH) recently hired in
early 1986.
E. Operations
3.13      Although NIB's commercial banking activitles (begun in April
1975) are profitable and have grown significantly over the vears, they
still represent only a small (about 25%) part of overall activities,
serving mainly NIBts corporate term clients. As in the past, development
banking (primarily term lending for projects) remains NIB's principal
activity. Between 1976 and 1985, 1/ NIB approved a total of about ¢ 1.3
billion in loans and equitv. Although a meaningful comparison is difficult
because of the series of devaluations since 1983, NIB's approvals for 1976
1/   1985 figures are provisional estimates.



- 11 -
and 1977 remained fairly constant (at an annual level of about e 28
million), thereafter moving in spurts between 1978 and 1982 from a low of
¢ 9.3 million 1978 to a high of ¢ 44.4 million in 1979 and then declining
again to e 27 million in 1980. In 1983, NIB's approvals jumped to e 189
million, no doubt reflecting the initial massive devaluation, then reached
an all-time peak of ¢ 922 million in 1985. Prior to devaluation, NIB's
total actual approvals in 1977 and 1978 were about 92% of forecast.
Comparison of actuals with forecasts after the initial devaluations (1978)
and in subsequent years is difficult due to the series of massive
devaluations that followed. Unlike approvals, disbursements between 1976
and 1985 showed a more stable pattern of gradual growth, except in 1980 and
1981 when there were drastic drops to e 17.5 million and e 9.9 million,
respectively. Between 1976 and 1985 NIB's total disbursements averaged
about 44% of actual approvals.
F. Financial Performance and Condition
3.14      NIB's comparative income statements and balance sheets are given
in Annexes I and II. NIB has shown a consistent though modest profit
averaging 2.1% of average total assets for the years 1975 through 1983 2/,
despite increasing administrative expenses (from 1.8% of average total.
assets in 1975 to a high of 4.3% in 1982 and then declining to 3.5% in
1983) and rising average resource costs (from 1.8% of average total assets
in 1975 to 2.6% in 1979 and then gradually declining thereafter to about
2.0% by 1983). NIB's past practice (terminated in 1984 at the Bank's
insistence) of counting accrued but uncollected interest from
non-performing loans as income has cast doubt on the reliabilitv of profit
figures (and thus its net worth) shown between 1975 and 1983. NIB's recent
conclusion of an interest-free (1% annual service charge) long-term
subordinated loan of ¢ 880 million from the Bank of Ghana (BOG) should
substantially reduce its average cost of funds, and help take some pressure
off its future profitability. Between 1975 and 1985, NIB raised a total of
US$92.2 million equivalent (based upon then-prevailing exchange rates) in
new resources, broken dowqn as follows:
2/   NIB's 1984 accounts have not been completed and published as yet, due
to the erosion of its net worth resulting from the combined effect of
the series of devaluations and the huge portfolio provisions made to
the accounts, and the decision by NIB to publish its 1984 and 1985
accounts at the same time.

3.15      NIB's portfolio (loans & equity) grew sharply from ¢ 63.5 million
in 1975 to ¢ 559.4 million as of December 31, 1984. 3/ During the same
period, the quality of NIB's portfolio continued to be of serious concern,
as actual portfolio arrears increased from about d 10 million in 1975 to
¢ 184.5 million 4/ in December 1984, and the portfolio (principal and
charges) affected by arrears stood at e 435.4 million or 71%. (See
Annex VII). The arrears problem has plagued NIB for years, and was
identified during appraisal as a major issue to be addressed bv the
institution. Although recovery targets were agreed upon with NIB, and
noticeable improvements made between appraisal of the first loan (1975) and
the second loan (1979), progress proved short-lived because of a lack of
adequate and intensive loan supervision and recovery procedures, a
generally lenient attitude by NIB towards delinquent clients, an
inefficient billing system, and the general deterioration in the economy
which made it all but impossible for clients to service their loans.
Furthermore, given NIB's past heavy promotional (as opposed to banking)
orientation, which still persists today, it is likely that many of the
projects promoted and financed by NIB during its early years were poor from
the start, and would not have withstood stricter scrutiny. Many of these
projects, even with the best of recovery efforts, are unlikely ever to
repay their loans to NIB. Nevertheless, loan recovery problems are now
being tackled, though greater efforts are still required. NIB's
reorganization has permitted the deployment of more project officers,
closer to its projects. Efforts are also underway to computerize NIB's
accounting and billing system which should help improve loan recovery.
However, the benefits of the new system will be determined only after the
system is in place and operational.

- 13 -
3.16      NIB's portfolio problem was further compounded by the series of
devaluations between 1983 and 1985 which drastically eroded NIB's net worth
vis-a-vis most major foreign currencies in which it had incurred its
foreign borrowings, resulting in a term debt/equity ratio of about 22:1 in
1984 based upon the then-prevailing exchange rate of ¢ 38.5   US$1.00.
This put the institution in violation of the term debt/equity limits (3:1)
stipulated in both its by-laws and the covenants of its Loai. Agreement with
the Bank. During Bank supervision of NIB in 1984, it was also discovered
that the institution was exposed to substantial foreign exchange losses
related to foreign loans (ADB, KfW and IBRD 1180-GH) on which NIB had
collected from sub-borrowers without repaying the foreign loans
back-to-back, attempting instead to roll over the funds. NIB was clearly
an institution in serious financial difficulty, requiring urgent and
decisive action.
3.17      The Bank carried out a detailed study of NIB's problems in 1984,
and recommended its financial restructuring. This restructuring provided
for (a) a substantial increase in NIB's authorized capital from e 40
million to between ¢ 1.5 billion and ¢ 2.0; (b) the opening of NIB's
capital to subscription by foreign development-oriented investors; (c) an
increase in NIB's debt/equity ratio to 10:1; (d) the provision by BOG of an
interest-free twenty-year subordinated loan (quasi-equity) of ¢ 880 million
to NIB, 5/ and (e) BOG's agreement to allow NIB to continue to repay the
foreign loans on which it is exposed at the rate of e 2.75/US$. Agreements
were reached with the Government on all of the above recommendations in
early 1985, except for item (e) to which the BOG gave its official approval
in November 1985.
3.18      In June 1985, as part of the financial restructuring exercise as
well as the Bank's normal supervision, a joint account-by-account review of
NIB's entire portfolio was carried out with the participation of NIB, its
auditors and Bank staff. The objectives were to (a) accurately assess the
quality of NIB's portfolio; (b) determine the recoverability of its
investments; (c) determine the reasonableness of the existing provisions
for portfolio losses; and (d) form a basis for the realistic valuation of
NIB's shares. The findings indicated that NIB had substantially
under-provided for portfolio losses over the years and overstated its
annual profits and net worth. Following extensive discussions between
NIB's management, BOG and the joint review team, it was agreed that NIB
would increase the level of its 1984 year-end provisions by e 362 million
as follows:
5/   NIB may convert this loan to equitv upon maturity, at its option.

Equity ....... ..                            12.5
Total ........ .    362.0
3.19      On the basis of NIB's pre-audit accounts, an estimated net profit
of about e 35 million had been indicated before taking into consideration
the additional provisions, which resulted in a loss of e 327 million for
1984. In terms of NIB's financial condition, the large additional
provision completely eroded NIB's net worth in 1984 as follows:
Million
Cedis
-  Net worth as of January 1, 1984 ......   103.7
-  Net Loss for the Year ...............  (327.0)
-  Net worth December 31, 1984  ......    (223.3)
The adverse impact of this provision was significantly mitigated by the
quasi-equity of e F80 million injected into NIB by the BOG in early 1985;
this enabled the institution to show an effective net worth of e 656.7
million. NIB is also currently completing the revaluation of its (mainly
fixed) assets to reflect the devaluations and inflation over the years.
Although NIB expects the value of these assets to multiply by about 15
times, the results of this revaluation, even after normal adjustments for
depreciation, will probably put additional pressure on NIB s future
profits, given the higher depreciation base coupled with the lower
income-generating base (i.e., reduction of the productive portfolio).
Except for some short-term squeeze on NIB's profits, its financial outlook
is still fairly good (particularly after the almost completed restructuring
exercise). With the additional foreign share capital subscription now
being sought (DEG has already committed an amount of at least DM 1.0
million and EIB has shown strong interest), NIB should present a fairly
healthy balance sheet. However, NIB's future will depend upon (a) its
ability to aggressively recover its loans; (b) proper arrangements to
ensure that NIB does not assume any further exchange exposure, even on its
recently concluded ADB fixed-term UA 25 million (about US$25 million), or
other future lines of credit; and (c) the adoption of a sound business
strategy, with profitability as an essential objective of its operations.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The basic objectives of the project were:
(a)   to provide NIB with a portion about (62%) cf Its
much-needed foreign exchange resources required to
assist viable (mainly small to medium size)
enterprises, while also helping NIB to mobilize other
external resources;
(b)   to further strengthen NIB's institutional
capabilities, particularly in the areas of appraisal
(through Bank reviews of subprojects), investment
supervision and loan recovery; and
(c)   to harmonize NIB's policies with government's
industrial priorities, thereby providing an
opportunity for ongoing dialogue between the Bank and
Government on the subject.
4.02      The project, consisting of a US$10 million line of credit, was
expected to assist NIB with about 41% of its total needs and 62% of its
foreign resource requirements for financing investments in manufacturing,
agro-industry (food processing) and tourism during the 1976 and 1977 fiscal
years. The maximum maturity of NIB's subloans was to be 15 years (average
of 7 years), with interest rates at 12.5% per annum plus a 1% service
charge on the outstanding balances. NIB would also charge a 1% commitment
fee on the undisbursed balance of each subloan.
B. Project Implementation
4.03      The project became effective on March 2, 1976, approximately 3
months after Board approval, and commitments began shortly thereafter; a
total amount of US$3.24 million equivalent was committed to 10 projects in
1976. By the end of 1977, a total of US$ 8.57 million (85% of the total
loan) had been committed. By the original terminal date (December 31,
1979), NIB had committed almost the entire amount (US$9.9 million) of the
loan, except for about US$100,000 which was earmarked for exchange rate
fluctuations. In March 1983, long after the original closing date
(Decamber 31, 1981) but within the third revised closing date (June 30,
1983), NIB requested that the unutilized US$211,500 balances on 11 projects
be cancelled and applied to another previously-approved project. This
request was approved, but it was not considered necessary to extend the
submission date.
4.04      Unlike commitments, disbursements under the line of credit were
significantly slower than appraisal estimates. From zero percent through
June 1977, they jumped during the next four quarters (thru June 1978) by a



- 16 -
total of US$6.2 million, bringing cumulative disbursements as of June 1978
to 103% of appraisal estimates. Beginning in September 1978, disbursements
once again slowed, gradually reaching a low of 81% of appraisal estimates.
By the original closing date (December 31, 1981), cumulative disbursements
were 90% of appraisal estimates. At the request of NIB, and given the
generally difficult economic environment as well as the scarcity of foreign
exchange, the Bank agreed to three extensions of the closing date, finally
closing the loan on June 30, 1983, eighteen months past the original
schedule. The slowness of disburi -ents was attributed to a combination of
factors. including the general ecoijmic deterioration in the country; the
great narcity of foreign exchange coupled with the Government's rigid
import licensing and foreign exchange rationing system; a drastic decline
in domestic demand; and a general loss of investors' confidence, despite
loan approvals from NIB. Given the circumstances, it is unlikely that NIB
could have done much better in its disbursement performance.
4.05      Contrary to expectations at the time of appraisal, NIB was unable
to have any input into the government's industrial policies, partly because
of the frequent changes in NIB's management during the life of the loan and
the overall deterioration of the economy. The level and continuity of
dialogue between the Bank and government was less than expected.
4.06      NIB's administration of the loan (in particular repayments to the
Bank of amounts collected from sub-borrowers) was unsatisfactory, due to an
error in interpretation by NIB of the Loan Agreement (Article II - Section
2.08) which exposed the institution to substantial foreign exchange risks.
Because its other lines of credit (ADB and KfW) provided for fixed
maturities regardless of repayment schedules of sub-borrowers, NIB
mistakenly interpreted the ma.;imum 15-year life stipulated in the Bank's
Loan Agreement and the "indicative" amortization schedule (Annex I of the
Agreement) as "fixed" repayments. Instead of repaying the Bank loan on the
indicated due dates and on a back-to-back basis (reflecting the aggregate
of the repayments of the sub-loans), NIB held on to the proceeds and
apparently rolled over the funds without obtaining forward coverage or
other protection from the Central Bank, while repaying the Bank only the
amounts indicated in the pro forma schedule. Because the average sub-loan
maturity (6-7 years) was substantially shorter than the maximum 15 years
allowed in the Loan Agreement (upon which NIB was basing its repayments to
the Bank), NIB, by retaining and revolving part of the funds, exposed
itself to substantial foreign exchange risk on the Bank Loan as well as on
the other (ADB and KfW) fixed-maturity foreign lines of credit. NIB's
estimated foreign exchange exposure on the Bank Loan (1180-GH) and other
foreign borrowing as of September 30, 1985 (based upon then-prevailing rate
of exchange) totalled ¢ 1.07 billion, and may be broken down as follows:



- 17 -
Loan/Credit                          Amount
(¢ million)
Bank Loan 1180-GH                          640.0
KfW (1 and 2)                              278.6
ADB (I and 2)                              157.7
Total         1 1,076.3
After discussion with several Bank missions, and as part of the agreed
financial restructuring exercise, the BOG fonnallv agreed in November 1985
to cover NIB's annual foreign exchange losses on the above loans by
allowing NIB to continue its repayments through BOG at the equivalent rate
of ¢ 2.75/US$.
4.07      NIB's erroneous interpretation of the Loan Agreement and the
resultant problems could have been avoided if NIB had properly familiarized
itself with all the provisions of the Loan, and if Bank staff had extended
its supervision more broadly to include NIB's handling of proceeds
collected from sub-loans, with a view to determining if there was any
foreign exchange exposure (inadvertent or otherwise). The Bank's
Controller's Department should also have applied its previous (but now
discontinued) practice of periodically reminding DFCs of the back-to-back
repayment schedule. It should be noted, however that even if NIB had
complied with the relevant provision of the Loan Agreement, the institution
would have still been exposed to exchange risks as long as it obtained
fixed-maturity foreign loans (e.g., ADB and KfW) with sub-loan repayment
schedules shorter than those of the foreign loans.
4.08      On the institution-building side, project implementation fell
short of expectations largely due to the lack of continuity in leadership
(para 3.06) and the emigration of several qualified staff. Several of the
qualified NIB professionals who did remain in Ghana were hired away to
assume key positions in other financial 4nstitutions. The result was that
NIB's already weak and ineffective supervision activity became practically
non-existent, while the gravely understaffed Finance and Accounting
Department has over the years has proven unable to reliably perform its
functions. These factors have significantly contributed to NIB's consis-
tently serious arrears problems, poor project follow-up and unreliable and
often late accounting reports. Although NIB's current Managing Director
appears both competent and committed, NIB will require aggressive and
consistent leadership, significant recruitment and training, a further dose
of technical assistance, and continued Bank support and supervision.
C. Compliance with Loan Covenants
4.09      NIB's compliance with loan covenants was unsatisfactory. Firstly,
although a significant amount of time and human resources were initially
expended upon loan recovery, thereby bringing portfolio affected by arrears
to a marginally acceptable level of 35% by March 1976, the situation
deteriorated during subsequent years, at one point reaching over 75% of
total outstanding portfolio. This situation which was due in part to the



- 18 -
generally difficult economic conditions within the country, was also
largely the result of NIB's lenient recovery approach. Secondly, as noted
in para 4.06, because it misinterpreted the Loan Agreement, NIB did not
adhere to its back-to-back repayment provision, and thus became exposed to
foreign exchange losses equivalent to several times its net worth by 1984.
This situation was only remedied in November 1985 when BOG agreed to cover
NIB's exposure. Finally, due to the series of devaluations (over 2000%),
NIB experienced a drastic erosion of its net worth vis-a-vis its external
borrowings, substantially exceeding the 3:1 debt/equity limit provided in
its by-laws and the Loan Agreement. Again, through the assistance of BOG
in November 1985 (para 4.06) and an increase in its legal debt/equity limit
to 10:1 (with prior Bank approval), NIB was able to come into compliance
with its debt/equity limit. Although these non-compliances could all be
considered serious, they were partly extraneous to NIB, and except for the
continued high level of arrears, have all beer corrected.
D. Utilization of Loan Proceeds
4.10      As shown in Annex VIII, the line of credit financed a total of 28
subprojects, of which 11 were expansion projects and 17 were new ventures.
Despite the heavily parastatal nature of the Ghanaian economy during the
period of the loan, it is noteworthy that 22 out of 28 (79%) of the
projects assisted were privately owned and the rest mixed. In terms of
geographical distribution, 18 (64%) of the subprojects representing US$5.2
million (53% of the amount of Bank sub-loans) were in urban areas, while 10
projects (36%) representing US$4.6 (47% of the amount of Bank sub-loans)
were in rural areas. Geographical distribution of sub-loans under the line
of credit, as with other NIB operations, was reas:nably broad, and although
most subprojects were in urban areas, over half of them were outside the
capital. Projects under the line of credit covered three main sectors,
with manufacturing accounting for the largest portion (43% of the total)
representing US$5.1 million (52% of the amount of Bank sub-loans), followed
by agro-indu:stry (29%) with US$2.3 million (23% of Bank sub-loans) and
mining and extraction (11%), with US$1.3 million (14% of Bank sub-loans).
Performance of Subprojects
4.11      NIB provided actual performance data on 17 (60%) of the
subprojects financed under the line of credit, accounting for a total of
US$6.2 million (63% of total Bank sub-loans). Some of the subprojects for
which data was not submitted are either still under implementation, have
repaid their loan(s) to NIB (and in some cases changed ownership) and/or
did not provide NIB with the requested data. Although the sample provided
is large enough for reasonable cinclusions to be drawn, the reliability of
some of NIB's data may be slightly questionable. Hence, interpretations
have to be made with caution.
4.12      On the basis of the data provided, it is evident that, while a
few of the subprojects did meet or exceed appraisal expectations, many of
them, though financially viable (actual rates of return exceeding 17%)
proved to be less profitable than anticipated. Out of those subprojects
for which the relevant information was provided, only 6 showed actual



- 19 -
financial rates of return equal to or greater than appraisal estimates,
another 5, though operating profitably, showed actual returns lower than
appraisal estimates. Of the remaining 6 subprojects in the sample, 3 are
operating at a negative rate of return while the other 3 provided no actual
financial data. In terms of economic performance, 5 subprojects are
actually operating at rates of return higher than appraisal estimates,
while 2 subprojects are operating viably but at lower than estimated
economic returns. An additional 6 subprojects for which no economic
returns were estimated at the time of appraisal are also operating viably.
Of the remaining 4 subprojects in the sample, one is operating at a
negative rate of return while the other three have not provided any actual
data. Five subprojects in the sample are operating at higher economic than
financial rates of return (one project, Clear Type Press, is even showing a
50% ERP compared %lith a negative IRR) reportedly due to government price
controls causing the products of these companies to be sold at artificially
low prices which, when adjusted to international prices, result in very
attractive economic rates of return. No data was provided on revenue or
capacity utilization, although available information seems to indicate that
most of the subprojects have operated at between 20-30% of capacity due to
unavailability of essential imported inputs and an overall decline in
domestic demand.
4.13      Twelve of the 17 subprojects in the sample experienced delays
ranging from one month to 60 months. One subproject was implemented 3
months ahead of schedule, and 4 others provided no data. The average
implementation delay was 15.2 months. Four subprojects in the sample were
implemented at actual costs ranging from 3% to 50% below appraisal
estimates, while the majority experienced cost overruns. The Western
Castings project was an extreme example, experiencing a cost overrun of
1000% and an implementation delav of 60 months resulting from problems with
two sets of foreign technical partners reported to have supplied inadequate
and partly used equipment. The company has begun partial production and is
still believed by NIB to be potentially viable despite its problems. The
average subproject cost overrun (excluding Western Castings) was 66.8%.
4.14      Although the actual number of jobs created by the sample
subprojects exceeded appraisal estimates (1,926 actual jobs compared with
1,733 estimated), the cost per job created was higher for 14 out of the 17
subprojects in the sample, and in one case was 4.5 times the appraisal
estimate. The actual investment cost per job (based upon the sample)
averaged US$20,000.
4.15      The main reasons for the mixed performance of the subprojects
were: (a) the generally difficult economic environment, resulting largely
from the scarcity of foreign exchange; (b) difficulties in obtaining import
licenses for equipment, hence delays in project implementation and cost
increases; (c) scarcity of imported raw materials and spare parts; (d) low
demand and capacity utilization; (e) generally over-optimistic appraisal
estimates; and (f) almost non-existent supervision of projects by NIB
during implementation. Although some of the factors were outside NIB's
control, many of the problems could doubtless have been avoided through
aggressive and close coordination with the government agency responsible



- 20 -
for issuance of import licenses, coupled with a more thcrough and
conservative appraisal (particular in the estimation of investment and
operating costs, implementation schedule and raw material availability) and
i:.tensive supervision during implementation. It is noteworthy, however,
that despite the general difficulties mentioned above, 16 out of the 28
enterprises assisted (accounting for US$3.36 million) have already fully
repaid their loans, while another 6 enterprises (accounting for US$2.34
million) are paying their loans (albeit irregularly) and the balance of 6
enterprises (accounting for US$4.22 million) are not paying at all. One of
these non-performing enterprises (Western Castings), accounting for about
40% of the delinquent amount, is still under implementation.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
5.01      Fulfillment of the project objectives, as described in para 4.01
was mixed. Although much-needed foreign exchange resources were provided
under the line of credit, and the large number of the subprojects financed
proved to be viable (though in most cases showing lower actual rates of
return and higher costs than estimated because of country economic
factors), the objective of institution-building (particularly in the areas
of investment supervision, loan recovery and general accodnting) and
contributing to policy-making in the industrial sector were not realized.
As noted previously, NIB was never able to establish and maintain an
effective project supervision unit due to frequent management changes, the
mass exodus of professionals from Ghana and the apparent low priority
attached to supervision activities. NIB also exDerienced a decline in the
capability of its Finance and Accounting Department. These factors,
coupled with the general decline in macro-economic conditions, are signi-
ficantly responsible for NIB's continuing portfolio arrears problem.
5.02      In addition to the general economic difficulties and
uncertainties, NIB's problems were compounded by a discontinuity in
management. The institution and its staff have withstood the test of time
reasonably well, however, despite frequent changes in top management and
the loss of qualified staff due to the difficult country situation.
5.03      The financial condition of NIB deteriorated seriously due to (a)
a decline in the quality of loan portfolio; (b) exposure to avoidable
foreign exchange risks; and (c) inadequate capitalization in the face of
massive devaluations. This deterioration, which was discovered by the Bank
supervision missions in 1984 and immediately brought to the attention of
NIB and the Government, along with recommended remedial measures, could
have been detected earlier and appropriate measures taken if either NIB's
management or the Bank had been more vigilant.
5.04      The quality of NIB's loan portfolio declined due to a combination
of external and internal reasons. The external reasons were the severe
economic decline in Ghana during 1978 to 1983, from which the country is
only now recovering, while the internal reasons were ineffective loan
supervision and recovery efforts. Despite the macro-economic problems, a



- 21 -
more organized and vigilant loan supervision and recovery program would
have likely reduced (even if marginally) NIB's high portfolio arrears.
5.05      NIB's exposure to foreign exchange risks resulted primarily from
NIB's management error and inadequate attention by the Bank to this issue
during appraisal and even thereafter. In addition to Its loan covenant
against the assumption of exchange risks by NIB on its sub-loans, the Bank
should have also restricted the DFC from assuming exchange risks (directly
or indirectly) on any of its external borrowings. If this provision had
been adopted and closely monitored during supervision of NIB, then the
situation in which NIB found itself in 1984 (on the IBRD - 1180-GH and
fixed term loans from KfW and ADB) could have been avoided. In order to
avoid future exposure, the Bank must act quickly to ensure that NIB repays
the current ADB Loan back-to-back (despite its fixed-term maturity) or
enters into appropriate arrangement with the Bank of Ghana for coverage.
5.06      Although NIB has substantially completed the agreed financial
restructuring exercise (and is now seeking new, preferably foreign develop-
ment-oriented investors), this effort is not sufficient in itself to assure
NIB's future. Given the drastically changed economic environment and the
likelihood of future changes, it is imperative that NIB's management adopt
a detailed remedial action plan and a business strategy for the next few
years. In the course of this effort, NIB should seriously assess whether
to continue its involvement in small-scale lending and some other
activities that demand a disproportionate amount of NIB's limited staff
time and resources.
5.07      NIB's entry into commercial banking activities (even though the
Bank discouraged such initiatives) has proven to be a sound strategic
decision, and has helped NIB to improve its profitability over the years,
while broadening its income base and complementing its development banking
activities.
5.08      Although NIB has been moderately profitable over the years, this
has been largely achieved at the expense of adequate portfolio provisions.
If this situation had been handled realistically in the past, profits may
have been smaller and modest losses may even have occurred, but the need
for the large one-time provisions in 1984 would have been avoided.
5.09      Resource mobilization by NIB was less than expected both from
foreign and domestic sources. This factor may be attributed largely to the
difficult economic and political conditions in the country during project
execution.
5.10      NIB's contribution to policy-making for the industrial sector (an
explicit project objective) never materialized. Experience under the
project (and elsewhere) would seem to indicate that DFCs and DFC projects
are not generally an effective lending instrument for policy reforms.
5.11      Project implementation was comparatively timely, with commitments
progressing as forecast and disbursements only slightly delayed overall.



- 22 -
The loan was fully disbursed 18 months after the closing date, a noteworthy
achievement considering the difficult country economic conditions.
5.12       The project's economic impact, though less than expected, was
satisfactory. Financial performance of the sub-projects was also fairly
good, as evidenced by the fact that 16 out of the 28 assisted subprojects
have already been fully repaid. Another 6 are repaying though irregularly
and the remaining 6 subprojects are non-performing loans. This repayment
performance is better than NIB's overall portfolio performance, and
represents a significant achievement in the difficult economic environment.
5.13      In sum, it is clear that Bank staff should have paid closer
attention to (a) protecting NIB from exposure to foreign exchange risks not
only on Bank loans but all foreign borrowings; (b) systems and procedures
in NIB to monitor the quality and performance of its loan portfolio;
(c) effects of massive devaluations on NIB capital and loan portfolio;
(d) aggressively opposing frequent senior management changes at NIB which
were disruptive; and (e) the quality and timeliness of audits.
5.14      Even after the closing date of a loan (and whether or not a new
Bank loan or credit is in effect), experience indicates that the Bank
should continue to supervise a DFC, closely monitoring current subprojects
as well as all those for which disbursements and/or implementation have
been completed within the previous 3-5 years. This is particularly
important as the immediate post-implementation period tends to be as
critical for projects as the implementation period itself.
5.15      Since 1984 the Bank has played a major role in the financial
restructuring of NIB, in assessing the quality of loan portfolio, and in
strengthening NIB's systems and procedures and management. These are
significant initiatives and the Bank should continue its intensive
supervision of NIB even after closing of the second NIB loan in June 1986,
and even in the absence of new lending to NIB, in order to ensure
sustainability of this cumulative effort at institution building.

COMMENTS ON THE PROC   COMPLETION REPORT ON
GHANA NATIONAL INVES'1Ir BANK (NIB) LIMITED PIJEC' (LOAN 1180 GH)
INTRODUCTION
The report on the above project relateL to a World Bank loan of
US $10 million granted to NIB for financing the foreign exchange
cost of 28 sub-projects in agro-industry, manufacturing and
tourism.  The loan, which wAs approved by the board of the World
Bank in December 1975 became effective in March 1976 and was closed
in June 1983. The report first gives a brief review of the
Ghanaian economy during the project implementation period. There is
then a discussion of NIB's capital structure, operations, and
financial performance at the time the project was being imrplemiented.
An analysis of the project is carried out in the last part of the
report.
In this paper, the objectives of the project are first outlined,
followed by a discussion on the implementation of the subprojects.
The objectives of the project as set out in the report were to:
(a) provide NIB with a portion of the foreign exchange
needed to finance viable (mainly small and medium scale)
enterprise, and support NIB's efforts to mibilise other
external resources,

(b) further strengthen NIB's institutional capabilities
particularly in project appraisal, investment supervision
and loan recovery, and
(c)  hanmonize NIB's policies with the government's industrial
priorities.
ANAL:.3IS OF THE REPORT
It was stated in the report that the first part of objective (a),
which concerned the transfer of IBRD foreign exchange resources to
finance investments through NIB, was achieved. This was supported by
the fact that out of 28 subprojects assisted, 16 had fully repaid
tleir loans, 6 were paying though irregularly and the remaining 6 were
non-performing loans. However, the various causes of failure of some
of the subprojects were due to Government price controls, and in one
case to the supply of partly used equipment. These factors were
external and outside the control of NIB. Mention should have been made
of any structural deficiencies within the subprojects being finanzed,
which could have contributed to their failure.
According to the report the second part of the same objective, which
was to help NIB mobilise other external resources, was not achieved.
This, the report indicated, was attributable to the difficult economic



ATTACHMENT B
- 39 -                           Page 4 of 8
and political conditions prevailing in the country then.  The
report should, however, have made specific suggestions on what
additional measures the World Bank adopted to help in the
attainment, of this objective, or what NIB's role was to have been
in this respect.  It did not explain whether NIB did actually
make any effort to attract foreign resources, and the reasons for
its failure if it did.
Furthermore, the report indicated that the second objective in
granting the loan to NIB was to strengthen NIB's institutional
capabilities, particularly in the areas of project appraisal,
investment supervision and loan recovery. Unfortunately, this
objective wias also not achieved, which according to the report,
was due to frequent changes in NIB's senior management.
Here again, the report was not specific on the roles the World Bank
and NIB were to play in so far as the institutional building objective
was concerned. T'his would have enabled an assessment of the
performance of either NIB or the World Bank to be made in the report.
Thus it might not be appropriate to blame NIB for' the failure to achieve
results, since the mere provision of foreign finance by the World
Bank could not have enhanced NIB's capabilities in those areas
mentioned above.

Besides, no consistency can be drawn from the report between the fairly
good financial performance realised under objective (a) (paragraph 5.12)
for the subprojects, and the poor performance in project appraisal,
supervision, and loan recovery expressed under objective (b). In the
face of this, the report should have mentioned the criteria upon which
the failure of the second objective was determined.
The third objective was to harmonize NIB's policies with the Government's
irndustrial priorities. The report mentioned 'that there was no effective
industrial sector policy dialogue between the NIB and the Government
during the 1975-83 period. As a result, NIB had made little or no
contribution to industrial sector policies by the Government.
Even though there is the need for harmonization, of NIB and government
industrial policies, the consequences of a lack of harmonization could
not be inferred from the report since no adverse effect on NIB's
operations was mentioned in this regard. One could therefore conclude
that the failure to achieve this cbjective had not brought any
undesirable consequences on NIB's operations. It was also not clear from
the report at hlat stage there was no harmonization. One presupposes
that the projects were selected to conform to the priority areas of the
government; then one wonders why at the completion of the peoject, there
was no harmonization with the government.

ln paragraph 4.06 mention was made of huge losses made by NIB as a
result of series of foreign exchange adjustments. This situation had
arisen supposedly from NIB's misinterpretation of the loan agreement,
which stipulated that NIB should have paid the loan on a back-to-back
basis rather than waiting for the fifteen year maturity of the loan.
The "indicative" amortization schedule for loan repayments (para.4.06)
given by the World Bank to NIB could be cited as an additional reason
for the huge devaluation losses suffered by NIB. Though NIB is guilty
of not having foreseen the devaluation losses and therefore did not
repay the loans on a back-to-back basis but rather rolled it over, the
World Bank should have given NIB a more "specific" and binding
amortization schedule which would have ensured a better repayment
performance. In fact, the World Bank's mechanism for ensuring repayment
cf subloans collected by NIB was ineffective.
NIB, in fixirng the interest rate at 12.5% per annum, here again
failed to anticipate the need for an upward revision of interest rates
to take account of rising inflationary trends.

NIB due to exchngie rate adjustmerits.

The report suggested (para. 5.06) that NIB might consider
discontinuing its lending operations to small/mediumi scale
enterprises. This is so because their sheer number and spread
throughout the country have been a burden on the limited staff,
timrie and resources of NIB.
The development of the small/medium scale industrial sector
(especially in the rural areas) is of primary importance to economic
development of this country, because it would help eliminate rural
poverty and enhance rural employment. In this light, we would
recommend the continuation of its lending operations to small and
medium scale entelprises but on a clearly established selective
basis.
In the face of its staffing problems, NIB could tailor its loans
within the limits of its own resources. In the mean time,
appropriate measures should be taken to strengthen the staff
position and organise training programmes to improve their efficiency
in project supervision, loan recovery and project appraisal. These
should be done with a view to expanding credit facilities to these
sectors in the long term.

CONCLUSION
The report; has been extensive in its coverage of the subject. From
the above analysi_, it is hoped that
i.       NIB would develop a more effective programme to enhance its
operational capabilities.
The World Bank would continue to offer financial, technical
and material help towards this goal.
iii.     In future financial or technical programmes with NIB, the
World Bank would better articulate the modalities for
achieving the set aims and objectives.
iv,      NIB would strengthen its efforts to attract equity
partic-pation in order to broaden its capital base,  In
addition to mnny advantages, this would serve as a check
on the frequent changes in management that has worked
againist the bank.
v.       NIB, being a development bank, should be given a wide measure
of freedom in selecting its projects within the government's
policy guidelines.  This would help generate NIB's own
abilities in project financing, loan recovery and project
appraisal.
