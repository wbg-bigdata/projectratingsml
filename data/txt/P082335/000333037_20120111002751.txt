1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      Economic and Sector Context. In 2003, with a GDP per capita of US $260, Tanzania
remained one of the poorest countries in the world. Although the country had experienced
average real GDP growth of around 5% per year since the introduction of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy in 2000, thirty-five percent of the population still lived below the national
poverty line, and the country ranked 160th in the United Nations‟ Human Development Index.
Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remained a major challenge for
Tanzania, given that the health-related MDG indicators had been stagnant or had worsened
during the 1990s. Infant mortality rates (IMR) and child mortality rates (CMR) had worsened
from IMR of 92 per 1,000 live births in 1992 to 99 per 1000 live births in 1999 and CMR
from 141 per 1000 in 1992 to 147 per 1000 in 1999. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS was 12%
(2002), and life expectancy at birth had dropped from 52 years in 1990 to 49 years in 2003.
Total fertility rate remained high at 5.6. At the time, more than 70% of life years lost in
Tanzania were due to preventable causes, notably malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS,
perinatal and maternal conditions. Figure 1 compares Tanzania mortality rates with the rest of
SSA, whereas Figure 2 takes a closer look at Tanzania‟s top ten causes of mortality in patients
over five years old.

2.      Health Sector Reforms and the SWAp. In 1999, the Government of Tanzania
(GOT) embarked on a health sector reform program to focus on implementing the essential and
most cost-effective health interventions given the burden of disease and to transform financing,
management and delivery roles by emphasizing quality, empowerment of local authorities and
the beneficiary, and greater use of non-government agents. Tanzania's Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS) of October 2000 focused on reducing income poverty through sustaining
macroeconomic stability, rural sector development, export growth, and private sector
development. In line with the sector reform program and PRS, a three-phase, long-term (2000-
2011) Health Sector Development Program (HSDP II) was jointly developed by the GOT and
Development Partners (DP).         The HSDP II Project supported the Second Health Sector
Strategic Plan (HSSP II)1. Grounded in the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), the HSSP II was
appraised and endorsed by all partners in April, 2003. The HSSP describes roles and
responsibilities for all levels of the health system. This program was supported through a
Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp)2. The various modes of financing of the health SWAp include
government budget (excluding budget support) 51%, general budget support from partners 20%,
pooled funding 14% and direct project funding 15%. In these cases, project funds are employed
to finance specific designated activities under the MTEF or District Plans, with GOT and pooled
funds filling in the balance of the costs. Malaria and AIDS receive substantial earmarked funds
and these sub-programs are mainly project financed. Figure 4 shows the different modes of
financial support for the SWAp. The funding supports the implementation of the MOHSW
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the 133 Comprehensive Council Health
Plans (CCHP).

3.    Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank assisted the country in translating
government-led investment in health, nutrition and population into achievements of its

  HSSP II: The Strategic Plan has objectives and targets organized under three components: district health services, secondary and tertiary
hospitals, and central support. The emphasis o f the 2003-2008 strategic plan was s on “district health services? Component 1, where most of
the essential health services are provided. HSSP II looked at significantly improving the quality of those essential health services, make Council
Health Management Teams and district health providers more accountable and strengthen community ownership. Component 2 focused on “the
secondary and tertiary hospitals? as a way of ensuring good quality of health services delivered at these levels. Component 3 “Central
support? was to ensure effective planning and implementation of health services through an effective regional level and a well focused central
ministry.
2
  Under the 1999-2002 Program of Work (POW), commendable achievements were made regarding joint planning and evaluation of planned
activities, as well as pooled/basket funds arrangements under the SWAp. The British, Dutch, Danish, Irish, Swiss and German governments
pooled all or parts of their financing to (a) finance central MOH procurements and activities that appear within the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework, and (b) provide grants to districts in support o f non-personnel recurrent costs in district plans and budgets.



                                                                        3
development objectives. The Bank worked closely with the other development partners who
coordinated their contributions (financial, technical and other) through a Sector-wide Approach
(SWAp) in support of the government defined sector development program. This program was
reflected in the Second Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP II) and the accompanying Medium-
Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). The rationale for the Bank involvement in the SWAp
was to mobilize the Bank's comparative advantage vis-a-vis the other partners3. The Health
Basket pooled funds from eleven development partners in order to reduce transaction costs and
strengthen government systems.

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.      The objective of the phase II project was to achieve improvements in the provision of
quality health services through continuing to support the reforms, capacity development and
management of resources, while placing a greater emphasis on quality. The following key
indicators were designed to monitoring the progress of the project. The indicators would also
be used for assessing the long-term impact of the Health Sector Development Project.

      a) Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) (99.1 in 1999).
      b) Ratio of the IMR of the poorest quintile to the IMR of the least poor quintile (113:88 in
         Under-five mortality rates (146.5 in 1999).
      c) Life expectancy at birth (49 in 2003).
      d) Total fertility rate 15-49 (5.6 in 1999).
      e) Maternal Mortality Ratio (370/100,000 women of child bearing age per surveillance in
         2002).

5.     As the APL was supposed to shift through to PRSC at the third phase, the following
milestones were to be used to monitor suitability to transition.

      a) The gradual shift of Bank financing for health from the Adaptable Program Loan to the
         PRSC is compensated for by increases in the allocation to the health sector.
      b) Annual procurement audits find that there are improvements each year.
      c) The Annual Health Sector Reviews assess the status of implementation of the Health
         Care Waste Management Plan.

1.3        Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
           and reasons/justification

6.      The PDO was never revised during the lifetime of the Project. However, a number of
indicators and target values were revised to reflect the implementation progress and other
additional financing over time. Major indicators revised or dropped include (description of
magnitude of revision and effect is found in the data sheet).
    a) Infant mortality Rate.

  The Bank was to play the following role during the implementation of the SWAP through the HSSP II. “(a) complementing government
financing and the financing of other partners; (b) liaising with central ministries: Finance, Planning Commission, President Office:) to foster
synergy between health sector initiatives and the range of development initiatives outside the health sector; (c) transfer knowledge and
providing policy advice related to health sector financing, human resources for health, and the role of the private sector; and (d) encourage and
enable the MOH to pay greater attention to monitoring the impact of reforms.



                                                                       4
      b)   Ratio of the IMR of the poorest quintile to least poor quintile.
      c)   Under five mortality rate.
      d)   Total fertility rate.
      e)   Life expectancy.

7.         Intermediate outcome indicators revised were:

      a) Government Health Budget per capita; value increased from 9 to 14 US$ per capita in
         the first AF.
      b) Percentage of health facilities with designated anti-malaria drugs; - dropped.
      c) Total fertility rate was revised upwards.

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

8.       The main beneficiaries of the HSDP II were Tanzania households, especially women,
children and other vulnerable persons as the project focused on improving the provision of
health care to the overall Tanzanian population, as stipulated in the PDO. The project was
designed to cover 100 percent of the districts hospitals and health centers, making improved
services available for up to 100 percent of the population. As the main component of the
project was improving district health including quality, all district hospitals and primary health
facilities within districts in local government areas were beneficiaries to the project. In ear
marked project funds, such as the food fortification initiative, it benefited up to 23 million
people, and the malaria bednet programme directly benefited 7 990 000 people, of which 50.8%
were female. Other project beneficiaries included people living with HIV/AIDS.

1.5        Original Components

9.      The second Phase of the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP II) built on the
success of HSDP I. It continued to address constraints of effective implementation of the health
interventions - namely, sector financing, human resources, logistics, management and
information systems, quality assurance, decentralization and the role of the private sector. The
HSDP II was developed to support the implementation of the HSSP II, taking into account that
the HSSP II was developed in line with Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) agreed to by all
partners; the HSDP II program components are the same as HSSP II components. The estimated
cost at the time of project design was US$963 million, of which IDA was to finance US$65
million. Of this, US$ 40 million was IDA and US$ 25 million was from a grant. The project had
two Additional Financings from 2007-2009 for IDA US$60 million and the second AF for
2009-2010 for IDA US$ 40 million. The total HSDP IDA financing was US$165 million
(original US$65 million and US$l00 million AF), with US$125 million or 76% going to the
Health Basket. As for Phase I Project, Phase II was implemented by the Ministry of Health
(MOHSW) and the District Councils under the President's Office, the Regional Administration
and Local Authority (PMO-RALG). Table 1 provides a summary of funding allocations for
HSDP II (2003-2007), while Tables 2a and 4b highlight the contribution of the two AF.

A brief description of the components:

10.      Component One: Improving District Level Health Services DLHS (US$ 98.3
4
  million):     The DLHS is the focus of health implementation; hence the importance of
improving coverage, access and the quality of health services delivered at this level. The
activities were addressed through developing district health manager cadre, strengthening in-
service training, implementing the health care waste management plan, rehabilitation and
renovation of primary health care facilities, ensuring that adequate technical and support
capacity available to councils at LGA level and supporting health care delivery in primary
health facilities. In addition, the component would strengthen the integration of HIV/AIDS
activities into service delivery at all levels, and increase accountability by publishing annual
district health budgets and performance data.

    The ratio of funding is obtained from the table of total costs in the original project between the components in Annex five of the PAD.



                                                                          6
11.     Component Two: Strengthening the Management of Secondary & Tertiary
Hospital Care (US$ 66.7 million- Includes Component Three): Hospital management
would be improved by developing a hospital manager cadre, mandating Hospital Strategic Plans
and operational plans, establishing Hospital Boards, and strengthening hospital financial
management. Quality would be improved through repairs to facilities and preventive
maintenance, implementing the health care waste management plan, and enhanced performance
audits including monitoring of service delivery outputs.

12.     Component Three: Strengthening the Central Level Stewardship Role: The central
and regional levels would be responsible for standard setting, quality control, financing and
human resource development for the sector. At regional level, capacity would be improved
through provision of managerial and technical support to districts, supporting districts in
decision-making, strengthening district capacity for supportive supervision, and facilitating
inter-district exchange of experiences. At central level, Central Ministries Health financing
would be increased and made more efficient and sustainable through improved budgeting,
increasing the government allocation for health and pooling of external finances. The Human
Resource crisis would be addressed through long-term manpower planning, more strategic use
of Zonal Training Centers (ZTCs), and innovations to address distribution, motivation and
retention of staff.

1.6 Revised Components

13.    No components were revised. The HSDP II contributed to the health sector reform
programme through implementing the HSSP II focusing on district health care delivery,
secondary and tertiary level care and the strengthening of the Ministry of Health capacity in
advocating for increased health financing and increasing both the number and quality of human
resources in the delivery of health care.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.      The program did not change in terms of scope, design, implementation arrangements
and schedule during the implementation time frame. However, the scale was somewhat
increased to include more focus on programmatic areas for malaria through the procurement of
ITNs and re-treatment kits through the first Additional Financing (AF) and support to the Food
Fortification Program and procurement of emergency obstetric equipment through the second
AF. The project had three extensions. The first, from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2009,
was to support the implementation of the HSSP II and the implementation of the malaria
programme activities. The second, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, was to
support (a) the implementation of the food fortification programme through the National Food
Fortification Alliance, (b) the purchase of emergency obstetric equipment which would help
increase the proportion of pregnant women delivering in health facilities, and (c) the successful
ending of HSSP II and initiate the implementation of the HSSP III. The third extension, from
January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011 was to facilitate the completion of the procurement of this
emergency obstetric equipment. The scope of implementation of the HSDP and the two AF was
guided by the HSSP II which did not change during the life of the project, as this was the long
term health development strategy of the country (2003-2007). The introduction of new
activities for malaria and food fortification was a result of MoHSW‟s request for specific funds


                                               7
to meet new and emerging demands that could not be adequately addressed through the original
financing arrangements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.     The Quality at Entry for HSDP II (2005) was rated “Satisfactory? overall by the
Bank‟s Quality Assurance Group (QAG), and the Strategic Relevance and Approach
was rated “Highly Satisfactory?. The HSDP II was a continuation of the long term HSDP from
2000-2011. The project preparation benefited from the Phase I of the APL and was developed
intensively with representatives of the Government, NGOs, and other donors in order to ensure
that the program adapted to and was consistent with the needs of those who were responsible for
implementing it, especially the MOH line directors and PMO-RALG, and that it would meet the
expectation of the beneficiaries. The project was designed to support overall health reform
within the context of the SWAp, being implemented under the councils at district level through
the process of decentralization by devolution. This design had great strengths in taking health
as close to the people as possible but at the same time suffered on issues of increased
complexity in implementing arrangements, such as lack of capacity in the periphery and
complex administrative procedure. The lessons reflected in the development of the HSDP II
were:

   a. Recognition by Governments and donors of the need for government ownership of
      programmes and the implementation of a more comprehensive approach on a
      government-led sector strategy and program that focused on building government
      systems and capacity (rather than capacity to manage only donor financing) and an
      agreed comprehensive financing framework.
   b. Recognition for focusing on the core functions of government and strengthening its role
      in the health sector by shifting away from service delivery to focus on stewardship and
      financing.
   c. Recognition for the need to coordinate human resource strategies with civil service
      reforms.
   d. Recognition for the need for improving the Health Management Information System
      (HMIS) and building demand for information at all levels as a requirement for good
      sector management.
   e. Recognition for the importance of strengthening reforms in hospital management.

16.    Lending instruments: IDA‟s support over the period 2000-2011 was to be in three
phases. Phase I from 2000-2003, phase II from 2003-2007 and Phase III through a PRSC from
2008 -2011. The first phase of the Health Sector Development Program was a US$22 million
Adaptable Program Lending (HSDP I, Credit 33800) implemented from 2000 to 2003. HSDP II
was a US$65 million second phase APL (Credit 38410, Grant H0710) approved in 2003, with
an original Closing Date of December 2007, which supported the implementation of HSSP II.
At negotiations of HSDP II, the GOT expressed its preference to have a larger share of
development assistance disbursed through General Budget Support (GBS). It was therefore,
agreed that IDA‟s financial support to the sector would be folded into the Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) by 2008 rather than continue through the third phase of theAPL, subject


                                              8
to meeting the three conditions5. As GOT did not fully meet the PRSC entry conditions6, the
two Additional Financings were part of the third phase given that the project did not progress to
PRSC as was originally envisaged. This phased IDA was designed to support the
implementation of the health reforms and explains the apparent extensions in the project closing
dates. As districts still relied heavily on the pooled funds to finance operating costs of health
facilities, and there was not yet a public finance mechanism which could fully substitute for
these funds. A reduction in the pooled fund upon the closing of the HSDP II (including its
additional financing) would have created a shortfall in financing at the service delivery level.

2.2 Implementation

17.    The project had some minor restructuring, outside of the two additional (AF) financings.
A request was made to extend the closing date to June 30, 2011 to allow for the procurement of
emergency obstetric equipment and also to ensure that the implementation of HSSP III was on
course. This restructured extension also allowed for support from the Governments of Australia
and Switzerland through co-financing trust funds, AUD 2 million from Australia and US$2
million from Switzerland this increased the amount of equipment to be purchased by about 50%
which would further increase the effectiveness of the intervention. The mid-term review was
conducted and the findings were responsible for realignment of the project implementation.

18.    Project disbursements: By June 30, 2011, the project had fully disbursed, including
resources from two trust funds from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Australian
government. The disbursement delays from the Bank and Partners were very minimal. The table
below highlights the disbursements as described by Government

  . i) increased Government allocations to the health sector to accommodate the shift of IDA financing for health from the APL instrument to the
PRSC; ii) improved procurement performance by the Borrower in each fiscal year of project implementation as assessed by procurement audits;
and iii) annual reviews of the implementation of the Health Care Waste Management Plan (HCWMP).
6
   The proportion of the government budget being devoted to health has declined over recent years; the proportion (excluding Consolidated Fund
Services) has decreased by 4.1 1 percentage points, or 29.1%, The 2009/10 health sector budget increased by 9.0%, which given 10.9% inflation
and 3.1 % population growth amounted to a real per capita reduction.



                                                                       9
19.      Legal Covenants: At project inception legal covenants were defined that would guide
the implementation of the Project. The choice of the covenants was deliberate to ensure that
HSDP II effectively contributed towards coordination between DP and governments and also
ensured that there was enough capacity within the implementing agencies to deal with fiduciary
and procurement issues. The choice of the covenants was realistic and no exceptions were
sought during the lifetime of the project over any one covenant. The covenants included annual
audit, conduct of joint annual reviews between partners and Government and the provision of
critical disbursement precedent that no disbursement would be made until a Memorandum of
Understanding (M-O-U) had been entered into among the Borrower, the Association and the
other Donors contributing to the Pooled Funds7. The MOU was duly signed and remained in
effect during the entire period of the project; although it was updated in September 2008. Each
of the additional legal covenants was implemented and by closure of the project all the legal
covenants had been complied with. (See Annex 9: Table 9: Legal Covenants and status at
close).

20.     Adequacy of Government involvement and commitment: Even though the GOT did
not meet the condition required to have shifted the APL to PRSC8, the Government continued to
commit fully to the implementation of the HSDP II, within the context of the Memorandum of
understanding signed with the DPs. The LGA at council level devoted time to ensure that the
planning of health was given priority within the development agenda. The development of
CCHP guided implementation at council level and PMO RALG and MoHSW worked jointly in
improving coordination arrangements at LGA level. In addition, the level of HR for health
targeted by GOT was high in order to meet the demands of implementing HSSP effectively.

21.     Risks and their Mitigation: The identified risks at project design were substantive
given the HSDP II was deriving lessons from the HDSP I. These risks were substantially
addressed during the implementation of the Project. The impact of HIV/AIDS in the sector was
partially mitigated under the National Multi-sectoral Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS to
which the Bank‟s Tanzania Multi-Sectoral Aids Project (TMAP) contributed, and received
substantial support from other donors, closer adherence to the „health planning‟ process was
laid down in the Procedure Manuals for the joint Disbursement System for the District Basket
Fund and the Central Basket Fund and this was implemented as per signed MOU between DP
and GOT. (See Annex 9: Table 4: Risk mitigation status at close)

22.    Performance Triggers: The choice of performance triggers were appropriate as they
addressed the overall GOT health delivery system and focused on the areas of most concern that
would be challenging during the implementation of the HSDP II. The triggers were improved
upon during implementation of the HSDP II. For example, Government and donor commitment


7
  . Other Legal covenants were: 1. the government will organize a joint annual review in March-April of each year to review the progress o f
implementation as well as a plan and budget for the subsequent year. 2. The government will submit to IDA and other development partners at
least 4 weeks before each annual joint review: (a) an annual report on implementation progress, expenditures, and results o f any technical
reviews; and (b) a plan of action for subsequent year. 3. On a quarterly basis, the government will (a) submit to IDA and other development
partners‟ reports on implementation progress and expenditures, and (b) organize basket financing committee meetings. 4. Annual financial audit
reports, carried out by an independent, will be submitted to IDA and other development partners within six months after each financial year. 5.
Annual external procurement audit reports will be submitted to IDA and other participating partners after each financial year. In addition to the
formal annual audits, ad-hoc procurement reviews may be conducted periodically.
8
   . The conditions that government did not meet are: i) increased allocation, ii) improved procurement performance and ii) the HCWMP
discussion at annual reviews



                                                                      10
was sustained, challenges by partners and GOT on disbursement to the health basket had largely
been resolved, and additional donors had been added to the basket, with the result that in
FY08/09 some 11 development partners (DP) provided over US$81 million in funding, up from
9 DPs and US$68 million in FY07/08. By 2010, the health basket had approached $90 million
representing 15% of the total health sector budget and 17% as IDA support. The health basket
had become the funding modality of choice among development partners. As of July 2003, all
districts produced comprehensive plans and received grants against district plans and this
continued till closure of the project. The national guidelines for an Essential Health Package
were developed and costed; during the project implementation review of the same was done.
Training guidelines across different disciplines were developed and used in the MPH program
and selected functioning zonal training centers. District level training is ongoing. A review and
revision of the planning guides was done to take into account the review of the basket
restrictions for use of funds, and for inclusion of a minimum set of preventive nutrition
interventions. For the Quality Assurance program, access to drugs and training was
strengthened. (See Annex 9: Table 5: Performance triggers status at close).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization: Linking
Implementation to results Framework

23.     The monitoring and evaluation of the project is described in two parts: 1) Monitoring of
the administrative and coordinating arrangements to ensure that the SWAp was being
effectively managed; and 2) Monitoring and tracking of the results framework indicators on the
delivery of project outcomes.

24.     The Director of Health Policy and Planning (DHPP) of the Ministry of Health (MOH)
were responsible for day-today coordination and monitoring of the project while closely
cooperating with the MOH‟s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and PMO-RALG‟s Director of
Local Government through the Health Sector Reform Secretariat. The MOH and PMO-RALG‟s
responsibility was to coordinate sector-wide planning and performance evaluations 9 .          A
participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) was adopted during the project M&E design.
This was seen as the most appropriate project design as it required the active involvement of the
key stakeholders in the implementation of the project. The Results Framework and the
monitoring arrangements were consistent with those from HSDP II and indicators supporting
the monitoring of the HSSP II.

25.    The MoH prioritized the strengthening of routine monitoring of health outcomes and
performance through HMIS as well as through specific surveys for broader sector wide progress
monitoring. To this end, the HSDP II involved two Demographic Health Surveys, one
Malaria/HIV indicator survey, a number of program reviews including a midterm review, joint
sector program reviews and annual programme reviews. Key performance indicators were


9
  The following was used to continuously monitor different aspects of the project. 1).Joint Annual Review including a review of the training
program (part of the Project‟s Annual Work plan), was carried out in March of every year preceded by a technical review to assess actual
expenditures and achievements over the year against the plans and review, the MTEF for the coming fiscal year, financial audit for the previous
year and the procurement audit of December 31 of previous year. 2). Quarterly Basket Finance Committee meetings that involved Senior
Management from MOH and PORALG as well as donor representatives channeling funds through the Basket; 3). Annual Sectoral Public
Expenditure Review (PER) and a Health Sector Performance Profile; 4). Quarterly progress reports were submitted by the districts with nineteen
indicators established to monitor progress in the implementation of the District Health Plans; 5). Financial Management and Audit Reports
(FMR): Financial Management reports were submitted quarterly and reviewed by the Task team.



                                                                     11
agreed upon by MOH and Development Partners, and incorporated into the PRSP. As the
project underwent two AF, targets which were exceeded (e.g., IMR and under-5 mortality) were
revised upwards. The total fertility rate target was seen as not likely to be met, and was
adjusted upward. The AF also introduced IDA Core Indicators to the results framework; these
were a) Children immunized (number); b) Health personnel receiving training (number); c)
Children receiving a dose of vitamin A (number); and d) Long-lasting insecticide-treated
malaria nets procured and/or distributed (number). As a result, the monitoring framework for
HSSP III resulted in several changes in indicators, including the ones for malaria (see results
data sheet for details).       Data showing progress of the SWAp towards meeting the
MDG/MKUKUTA goals and the implementation of the overall health sector is readily available.
Significant progress was also made in the development of regular reporting mechanisms and the
mainstreaming of the process for annual expenditure reviews and sector performance profile
reports. (See more results in Annex 2: Outputs by component)

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26.     Fiduciary: The responsible persons for the project in the MOH were the officers of the
Health Strategy Unit. Two accountants were designated whose roles were to handle Bank
related documentation for funds out and inside the basket (Central and District). These financial
management arrangements were deemed adequate in meeting the Bank‟s minimum
requirements for financial management for the project.

27.     The Tanzania Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was carried out
and completed in the year 2001. The assessment concluded that while Tanzania had a “sound
system of formal rules for financial management and many of these rules had been recently
updated and strengthened, issues of non compliance, limited execution, inadequate monitoring,
insufficient capacity, and lack of enforcement needed to be resolved?. These were the focus of
strengthening during the implementation of the project as reflected in the risk mitigation
measures (see Annex Table 9b: risks and mitigation) The Local Government Reform
Programme (LGRP) Progress report for the period of July to December 2002 showed steps were
undertaken to strengthen the Local Government financial management systems10. The project
provided funding for both basket and non basket activities. The Non basket fund activities were
for central government utilization and programme support for both malaria and nutrition,
including support for procurement of drugs through the Medical Stores Department (MSD).
The central funds eventually trickled down to the districts through central level funded activities
such as capacity building, facility rehabilitation and drug revolving funds from the MSD to
Hospitals and Districts.

28.    Unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were produced by the MOHSW quarterly
and these helped in monitoring the progress of the project. The project complied with all legal
covenants, including the requirement that procurement audits be submitted annually. The
project assessment of OP 13.20, “implementation of the project, including substantial
compliance with loan covenants, was deemed satisfactory?. Audits of the Special Account


10
   . These include: (a) the assessment o f the financial management capacity in all districts Local Government Authorities (LGAs); (b) the use o
f new guidelines for preparation o f development plans and budgets; and (c) use of new chart of accounts under the Government Financial
Statistics (GFS) codes by all LGAs.



                                                                      12
(Category 2 non-pooled expenditures) and SOE reviews were satisfactory. Unqualified audits
from the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) were by end of the project being received on
time. Audits of the pooled fund (Category 1) were the responsibility of the CAG but were
conducted by a contracted external auditing firm up to and including the 2006/07 audit. The
2006/07 and 2007/08 Audits were submitted late. The audits were reviewed in regular meetings
of the joint GOT-DP Audit Subcommittee which noted improvements over time. The Basket
Fund audits were mostly qualified11. An action plan to address the qualified audit issues raised
was developed in consultation with the Bank and other DPs. The DPs were very proactive in
engaging with the government so that plans of action (POA) acceptable to the DPs are
developed and implemented to deal with both the various audit recommendations and general
financial management issues, and these were monitored on an ongoing basis. The financial
management assessment took into consideration the overall fiduciary risk associated with use of
country systems and basket funded operations. It confirmed that appropriate mechanisms were
put in place over the years of implementation that meet the requirements under OP/BP 10.02.

29.      Procurement: Procurement for the Second Health Sector Development Project (HSDP
II) and both AF were carried out in accordance with the World Bank‟s “Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits? dated May 2004; revised October 1, 2006;
and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers? dated
May 2004; revised October 1, 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The
project management unit had a total of twenty procurement staff of which six procurement staff
was mainly involved in procurement of the ongoing Phase II program. The PMU was
responsible for undertaking procurement activities for the HSDP I1 financed by both the
Government and DPs. The overall project risk for procurement was noted as high and corrective
measures and mitigation actions were taken12. Figure 5 illustrates the analysis of the overall
procurement performance which shows improvement especially for procurement process
activities such as preparation of bid documents, bidding, evaluation and general compliance
with PPRA. However, shortcomings remained prevalent in contract management, supervision
of projects and delayed payments.




11
     . The main reasons for the FY07/08 qualified audit were: (i) the amount of the expenditure reported by MoHSW in the income and
expenditure statement was overstated by TZS. 2,692,14 1,262 (approximately US$ 2 million); (ii)0 .3% of the expenditures for which payment
vouchers could not be located; and (iii)a salary payment to one employee who was on unpaid leave (about US$ 4,400 or 0.03 percent of the
Basket Fund expenditures) was not refunded by the responsible staff. The first issue related to the year-end transfer of funds from one
government account to another (i.e., Basket Fund account) for annual reconciliation, which was processed but not yet effected. The second issue
relates to filing problems which are currently being addressed and the employee in the third issue has now returned to work at MOHSW and
there is every expectation that a full refund will occur.
12
   . These are; training staff in data management and procurement filing; providing the procurement staff with adequate working space, and
facilities for safe keeping of documents; and selecting contracts below the new threshold to undergo prior review.

30.     Environment: The HSDP Phase II was categorized as a “B? under the Environmental
Assessment. The project supported the delivery of health services and would therefore only
generate medical waste. The project built on what the MAP had started in financing; the
revision of existing health sector guidelines on appropriate management of hazardous medical
waste at medical facilities and at disposal sites to include the relevant dispositions regarding
HIV/AIDS, and other Medical Waste. A Health Care Waste Management Plan (HCWMP),
including a set of National Guidelines was developed. The HCWMP focused on the reduction of
hospital waste and on developing sanitary landfills, as opposed to incineration. The training of
national staff in these guidelines was key in monitoring the implementation of the HCWMP.


                                                        14
Implementation of the Health Care Waste Management Plan began in FY06/07, and the first
planned implementation review was held during the May 13, 2009 Bi-annual SWAp Meeting. It
was noted that progress had been made but that more needed to be done especially on the
training performed and on reporting of activity implementation. An update of the HCWMP was
completed in 2007. Subsequent to this routine implementation of the HCWMP was done. This
has been reflected in the development of the new project to ensure that extra emphasis is placed
on scaling up the actions of the revised 2007 HCWMP.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.     A number of important developments occurred between 2003-2007 where the Bank
started looking at a shift in its approach towards supporting decentralized levels, i.e., local
governments and communities. The Bank‟s letter to the GOT of February 24, 2009 suggested
consolidating some of the existing funding mechanisms to the decentralized level into a few
multi-sector local government baskets, thereby reducing transaction costs and further promoting
alignment to country systems. The focus of this approach would be to concentrate primarily on
the protection and promotion of basic social services at the local level, providing a framework
for multi-sector support to local service delivery. As part of the 2nd AF, the request to extend by
one year was in part to ensure that the new HSSP III implementation was initiated while paying
significant attention to building governance and accountability structures at the local level. This
was to ensure that efforts to build capacity and improve local service delivery (such as the
supply chain from the district to the health facility level) would be sustained over time13. This is
currently on going through the revision of the Comprehensive Community Health Plan (CCHP)
guidelines that reflect the focus of HSSP III and enhance accountability at the community level.
A new project along this approach is currently under preparation. This project will help build
on the gains attained in the HSDP II and will continue to focus on local service delivery
ensuring long term sustainability through capacity building.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Effectiveness and Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.    Relevance of the PDO: Relevance of the PDO is rated SUBSTANTIAL. The PDO
contributes not only to the CAS but also to higher level country objectives relating to Tanzania's
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) of October 2000 14 . The PRSP committed to reducing
morbidity, improving nutrition and strengthening access to health services “in order to raise the
productive life of Tanzanians?. The Health Sector Development Program (2000-2011) is the
government‟s long-term strategy to implement the PRS in the health sector.

33.    Relevance of design and implementation: Relevance to design and implementation is
rated SUBSTANTIAL. The adoption of the SWAp broadened the interactions between the
MOH, MOF and PMO-RALG (President‟s Office, Regional Administration and Local


13
   . This is responding to the need for effective system at district level as the basis for the effective implementation of a more decentralized
basket.
14
   This focused on reducing income poverty through sustaining macroeconomic stability, rural sector development and export growth, and
private sector development., improving human capabilities, survival and well-being through improving education, health, social well-being,
reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment.



                                                                        15
Government) and the donor community. The Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS)15 and the
February, 2003 Rome Declaration on Harmonization recommended that donors adopt joint
actions, harmonized rules and procedures. The project design and implementation matched the
DP work through country systems to strengthen and improve the delivery and quality of health
care services working through the SWAp.

34.    Relevance of the PDO to the CAS: The relevance of the PDO to the CAS is rated
SUBSTANTIAL. The Bank‟s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY00-FY03 for Tanzania
supported the PRS and built on the Government‟s Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS). The
Program and Project were consistent with the aims of the CAS and PRS. The CAS highlighted
both service delivery and better coordination of development assistance, endorsing sector wide
approaches and the move to program (rather than project) support. The CAS stated that the
Bank would retain significant focus on health16. Both the first and second AF were developed
within the context of the 2007-2010 CAS, that stated: “An ongoing investment program in
health will be extended through FY 10 with supplemental financing that address short term
financing gaps. Thereafter it is expected that IDA‟s health financing will be provided through
PRSCs.? The second Financing continued to support IDA‟s 2007-2010 CAS focusing on
harmonized aid modalities through participation in the health SWAp, reflecting on the need for
more share of GBS and recognizing the greater efficiency and impact achieved through sector-
wide approaches.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

35.           The PDO of HSDP II was substantially achieved and rated Satisfactory

36.     The project development objective was to improve the provision of quality health
services through continuous support of reforms, capacity development and improved
management of resources, while placing a greater emphasis on quality. In order to do this,
the following intermediate goals were recognized:

        1. Effective central and regional level support to quality, financing and human resources.
        2. Improved District Level Health Services.
        3. Strengthened Management of Secondary and Tertiary Hospital Care.

37.    The HSDP II (2000-2011) was developed as a sector project that formed the backbone
of implementing the HSSP II (2002-2008). The development of the HSDP II was a follow-up
from the HSDP I whose objective was to improve resource management and the quality of
health services through sector reforms and institutional capacity building. Drawing on the
lessons and achievements of the HSDP I, the HSDP II was developed to support the
implementation of HSSP II and ensure that the health reforms initiated during the HSDP I were
implemented successfully and sustained. The main object of the HSDP II project was to


15
     . The TAS makes specific reference to aid modalities, encourages capturing external assistance on-budget, and promotes the use o f pooled
funds.
16
   The Health Sector Development Program contributed to three of the four CAS pillars. private sector development, improved social
infrastructure to enhance access or the poor to essential public services, and public sector reform and institution building, to increase the
effectiveness o f public service delivery and improve governance .



                                                                         16
improve access, utilization, quality, and financing of health services through increased
efficiency and effectiveness in use and allocation of resources, to maximize impacts on health
outcomes, especially among the poor, women, and children. The project had three main
components which focused on service delivery standards reflecting global recommendations
such as attainment of the MDGs. The three components were designed to support a defined
package of cost-effective interventions which were expected to improve delivery of quality
health services. The HSDP II continued to address effective implementation of these
interventions - namely, sector financing, human resources, logistics, management and
information systems, quality assurance, decentralization and the strengthened role of the private
sector. This section discusses the implementation of the main focus areas with the major
implementation areas being discussed in the Annex 2: Output by Component Section.

38.     Decentralization: The GOT‟s focus on health care reform began in 1994 with the goal
to improve access, quality, and efficiency of service delivery. The main focus of reform was to
strengthen primary health care, district health services, secondary and tertiary service delivery.
An important part of this was the policy of Decentralization by Devolution (D by D), which
transfers authority and responsibility for health care from the central MOHSW to Local
Government Authorities (LGAs). This policy was enacted through the 1998 landmark
legislation, Policy Paper on Local Government Reform, based on the principle of political
devolution and decentralization of functions and finances within the framework of a unitary
state.

39.      Health services in Tanzania are now delivered through a decentralized system whereby
local governments (under the Prime Minister‟s Office–Regional Administration and Local
Government, or PMO-RALG) are responsible for service delivery through dispensaries, health
centers, and district hospitals. The implementation of the decentralization policy is still the
subject of major efforts under the Local Government Reform Program II to iron out lingering
challenges in the separation of roles and responsibilities between PMO-RALG and other
ministries, including the MOHSW. Efforts are also under way through various government
initiatives (some with development partner support) to strengthen LGAs‟ ability to deliver
services by improving their management capacity and programmatic and financial
accountability and to streamline working relationships between ministries. Under the
decentralized structure, the MOHSW is responsible for:

           a. Policy formulation, regulation, control, quality assurance; and monitoring and
              auditing.
           b. Resource mobilization and allocation, coordination, and inter-sect oral linkages.
           c. Management support to level-three hospitals, including national, referral, and
              special hospitals.
           d. Public health-related interventions.
           e. Health and social welfare research.
           f. Management of executive agencies.
           g. Supervision of preventive and curative health services delivery.
           h. Training key professional health cadres and monitoring the quality of training
              offered by private institutions (COWI 2007).




                                               17
40.     However, to effectively carry out its responsibilities, the MOHSW collaborates closely
with PMO- RALG and the LGAs, which fund and oversee all district-based health activities.
The MOHSW relies on LGAs to implement new policies, allocate resources, deliver health
services, and provide health data. In addition to working with LGAs, the MOHSW must also
collaborate with several other ministries: the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs
(MOFEA) to provide funding, and the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology
(MHEST) to train health workers. The delineation of responsibilities between the MOHSW and
LGAs increases the complexities for the MOHSW in overseeing effective service delivery and
consistent policy implementation. The GOT is undertaking the Local Government Reform
Program (2008-2013), aimed at eliminating bottlenecks and improving coordination with line
ministries. The devolution of responsibilities for health facilities and health planning to Local
Government Authorities has contributed to improved health sector delivery in Tanzania – the
associated financial support (through the Health Basket Fund and Block Grants) has been
essential to achieving this result. Councils and their health management teams are able to
undertake meaningful budgeting through the CCHP (Comprehensive Community Health Plans)
and to supervise and operate local health facilities.

41.    Quality of Care (QoC): QoC is one of the HSDP II outcomes for improved service
delivery. To achieve this, the GoT working with Development Partners embarked upon the
development of policies, strategies, guidelines, action plans, and manuals that focus on general
and disease-specific quality improvement. With increased focus for QoC in the HSSP III,
Standard Operating Procedures, Treatment Guidelines, and overall standards are being
developed to support implementation of quality health services. A Quality Improvement
Framework Programme has been developed corresponding to an accreditation system for public
and private service providers to enhance quality of health service delivery in Tanzania. Figure 6
highlights QoC initiatives being developed across different levels of health care delivery.

Figure 6: Initiatives improve quality of health services in Tanzania




42.     Human Resources for Health: The health sector continues to face a serious human
resource challenge. This HR crisis is negatively affecting the ability of the sector to deliver
quality health services. There is a severe shortage of HR at all levels. The current establishment
of health service workers was noted to be half the total number required to effectively
implement health service delivery. The shortage is more severe in rural districts and at lower
level health facilities. Clearly, even though the number of health workers has increased with


                                               18
support of the HSDP, HRH still remain a big challenge for the MOHSW. Figure 9 below
provide a good illustration. The shortage is exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria,
TB, and population increase. Low output of qualified staff, mal distribution, poor remuneration,
poor infrastructure, lack of attractive retention schemes and migration to other countries after
training, and inter-sectoral movement also contribute greatly to the crisis. To mitigate this crisis,
and as part of government commitment to HRH response, government put in place initiatives
aimed at addressing this issue. The measures put in place include; long-term manpower
planning; innovative distribution to the districts especially rural areas; motivation and retention
of staff (including defining explicitly the role of Local Government Authorities (LGAs) in
relation to human resources for health); and the more strategic use of Zonal Training Centers
(ZTCs) and the use of incentives for rural facilities. The government also embarked on a
massive training program that saw more than 6000 new health workers trained. Figure 7
highlights the HR for health availability by cadre of health worker and percentage deficit.

Figure7: Human resources establishment and percent deficit




43.     Regarding availability of health staff, Figure 8 provides information on the deficit of
staff across different levels of health care in 2006 in the public sector. The total gap reflected
across levels is 65%. This is much higher than the gap by type of health cadre available. The
difference could be attributed to the private sector taking some of the health personnel thereby
further aggravating the already critical shortage in public facilities. However, in rural areas there
was a noted increase in private to government health worker migration following the increase of
salaries in 2007/08. The MOHSW programme of continuous worker recruitment and training is
aimed at increasing the human resource base. However, the magnitude of need is great and
compounded by other external factors of attrition, this is a big problem for the Ministry.
Progress made in improving both numbers and quality of cadres trained at all levels is evident.

Figure 8: Distribution of Human resources for health across different health care levels




44.    Another challenge is that health worker distribution across regions is not uniform. Rural
regions are less served as compared to urban regions. The figure 9 shows the distribution of
heath cadres by regions.

Figure 9: Proportion of Health Workers by region




 45.     The management of HIV/AIDS, MCH, IMCI, EPI and treatment of malaria was covered
at all levels of the health system with health centers being the focus of health care delivery. This
is discussed further in the annex; output by component section. At this point it will suffice to
say that improvement of the indicators was achieved. In addition, it was noted the HSDP was
the primary support for hospital rehabilitation and repair. Figure 7 provides an overview of the
number of medical staff available and the deficit. Clearly with a deficit of 39.4% across all
cadre types, it‟s quite challenging to deliver quality health services. (See Annex 2: Output by
Component Section)

46.     Health Sector Financing: Tanzania has a mixed system for health financing. 70%
from public and foreign financing and complemented by health insurance in the form of
National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), and Community Health Fund (CHF) and user fees in
the form of cost sharing. From the 2003/04 to 2008/09 financial years, the share of the health
sector in total government budget and expenditures had remained well below the 15% target of


                                                20
Abuja Declaration. However, actual health expenditure may have increased from 10% of total
government spending including Consolidated Fund Services (CFS)17 in 2004/05 to about 12%
in 2005/06. Despite a modest increase to 11% of actual spending in 2007/08, the share of the
health sector budget in the total government budget (including CFS) dropped slightly to 10% in
2008/09 due to the fact that total government budget increased slightly faster (20%) than the
increase in budget allocations to the health sector. Total public health sector spending in
nominal terms in the 2010/11 budget estimates are almost four times the level in 2004/05. The
largest increase has been in foreign non-basket funding and a substantial part of this is due to
the Global Fund grants now being shown “on-budget?. Spending per capita has increased by a
factor of 2.5 from $7.51 to $18.56 (estimates); although actual expenditure is often lower than
the estimated amount. Excluding debt service and related items, the percent of the total
government budget spent on health per capita increased from 11.3 percent in 2004/05 to 14.1
percent in 2005/06 and then declined steadily to 12.1 percent in 2008/09. There was some
improvement in 2009/10 increasing to 12.9 % with a further estimated decrease in 2010/11 to
12.1 Figure 10 illustrates the spending on health over time and the percentage spent on health.
Figure 10 below also shows a corresponding increase government spending in Tanzanian
shillings from TZS 206 554 Shillings in 2004/2005 to TZS 643011 million shillings in 2010/119
(approved estimates).

48.     The financing at district level is mostly through the health basket user fees, block grants
and the Health insurance reimbursement and community health funds. The health basket is seen
as the most reliable source of funding at district, let alone all levels. The utilization of other
funds outside the basket still remains sub optimal. Among the challenges is the need to increase
capacity across the districts especially at health centre level were most of the activities are
delivered. In addition, there is inadequate funding from the health basket and irregular
disbursement of block grant making implementation of work plans rather challenging; the
ceilings tied with the disbursements make rational management of resources difficult especially
in relation to rehabilitation and refurbishment. There is also inconsistent supply of medicines
from the Medical Stores Department. This cuts across all levels of health facilities. The MSD
attributed this to a number of factors of which irregular and inconsistent disbursement of funds
from the MOHSW was noted. In addition, slow procurement processes and cumbersome donor
processes could have contributed to this erratic availability of drugs at MSD.

49.     Public Private Partnerships: The 1999 Programme of Work laid out the vision that the
“public private mix will be promoted in the delivery of health services. This included a specific
Public/Private Mix Strategy to develop new ways of promoting private sector participation
through contracting out services and adopting the required legislation. The Government was “to
be more of a facilitator than the main provider of health services.? Four years after the POW
was published, the HSSP II noted that “the only significant achievement reported within the
area of PPP was the registration of new facilities?. Notably the factors that limited the
development of PPP were limited concept and practice; mistrust between the public and private
sectors; ownership of the providers rather than the health services provided and utilized was and
remains a major sticking point; funding and resource sharing arrangements at the council level
were not sufficiently equitable. For a way forward, there is a serious need of a policy and
strategy document on PPP to guide its implementation including guidance on equitable sharing
of resources at council level.

50.      Health Insurance Mechanism The new financing policy included cost sharing and user
fees, as well as insurance mechanisms for the health sector. Fees are collected at all health
facilities, with a system of waivers which targeted different populations (civil servants, rural
population, etc.), but overall insurance coverage in Tanzania remained quite low.

51.    National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF): The NHIF is a statutory health insurance
scheme established by the Act of Parliament no. 8 of 1999, amended to Act no. 25 of 2002. The
NHIF uses a fee for service method to reimburse its service providers. However, reimbursement
has remained comparatively low due to low level of claims, thus NHIF has built a considerable


                                                             22
reserve (Tanzania-German Programme to Support Health 2006). The HSDP II provided
US$ 2.0 million in 2004 for this activity.

52.      Community Health Funds (CHF): The CHF started in 1996 as a pilot scheme in Igunga
district and was later expanded to other councils with the expectation of eventually covering the
whole country (Ministry of Health 1999). The CHF was introduced as an alternative to user fees
charged at public health facilities. It is designed to cover people in the informal sector and rural
areas. As part of the project, the HSDP II was to finance a component of the health financing at
community level of which US$ 2.0 million was provided in 2004 to support pilot phase in 10
districts. Current uptake rate remains low and does not seem to be moving as rapidly to meet its
target.

53.     Out Of Pocket payments: Tanzania fares poorly on the level of Out Of Pocket (OPP)
contribution to utilization of health services. The high rate of OOP health financing underscores
the importance of strengthening alternative health financing mechanisms to improve on risk
protection especially for poor families in rural area so that OOP does not become a barrier
towards health care utilization. Figure 12 shows the comparison of OOP with other countries in
SSA. The 2008 NHA are showing a decreasing trend in OOP. (Data yet to be published.)

Figure 12: Comparison OOP 2005/2006 with other countries in SSA




54.     These different financing mechanisms offer an opportunity for increased sustainability
in health financing. However, they require increased devolution and development of systems to
support effective implementation of the schemes. As of now, all of the schemes are functioning
below optimal levels. It is hoped that the HSSP III will provide increased focus on the
processes and policies required to improve alternative health financing methods to compliment
GOT budget allocations on health.

55.     Logistics, Management and Information Systems: Within the Health Information and
Research Section (HIRS) of the Policy and Planning Division of the MOHSW the HMIS Unit
processes and analyses routine data from all health facilities. The section also conducts surveys
together with the National Bureau of Statistics and has a National Sentinel Surveillance Unit
(integrated into the MOH in 2002 after the completion of the Adult Morbidity and Mortality
Project). On the basis of information collected through these various systems the section
prepares all information required for the JAHSR, the MKUKUTA, GBS and the MDGs and is
responsible for compilation of the Annual Health Statistics report. It was noted that the HMIS
data continues to be intermittent and unreliable despite considerable external support with




                                                23
utilization and analysis at district level still minimal 18. Despite this, the overall partnership
observes that HMIS significantly improved with improved collection and management of data
at facility level. The data obtained for the project though remains relevant and valid due to the
number of surveys done through the MoH system with support from external partners that have
complemented the information for the MoHSW to make decisions. Given the observed
challenges, the HSSP III has placed greater emphasis on strengthening his area further.

56.     Progress towards Results Framework indicators: As of October, 2009, HSDP II had
already exceeded targets for two out of four project development objective indicators. By
December 2011, the DHS results clearly showed that the project indicators for five of the PDO
had been exceeded. Indeed, addition progress to the remaining PDO was substantial. (See data
sheet). Reductions in the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the under-five mortality rates (USMR)
were among the greatest observed in Sub-Saharan Africa over the last several years. Progress
has also been made in the equity indicator of the IMR distribution, with the 2007/08 figures
showing that 80% of the gap between the baseline and the target had been covered achieving the
target set at project development. By Dec 2010, Infant mortality rate had dropped further to
51/1000 live births. Less than five mortality rate was also dropped from 144/100 in 2008 to
81/1000 in 2010 a 44% reduction. In addition, after years of stagnation maternal mortality ratio
declined from 578/100 000 live births in 2004 to 454/100 000 live births in 2010. The
implementation of a systematic HSSP II which the HSDP II supported appears to have had an
impact in improving the different service delivery outcomes, especially the infant mortality and
child mortality as attested by a number of independent peer reviewed articles and the
independent evaluation report. The summary finding of the SWAP evaluation concluded that
the SWAp had contributed to improvements in health outcomes and to the quality of health
services at community level. These improvements can, in turn, be plausibly linked to progress
toward MDG and PRSP/MKUKUTA goals, especially relating to infant and child mortality.
(See Annex 2: Output by Component Section)

57.     Project ISR ratings: ISR ratings for implementation progress and development
objectives were consistently satisfactory during the project life, with one exception when
implementation and development objectives were rated marginally satisfactory due to the
turn-over of MOHSW management and associated interruption in pace of implementation. The
ISR at the time stated that it anticipated that the downgrading would be temporary and that the
next ISR would be upgraded, which it was. Delays in implementation were attended by GOT as
per recommendation of the DP (see ICR data sheet).

3.3 Efficiency

58.    Contributions to efficiency: The project contributed to harmonizing government and
donor mechanisms so that the DP efforts become complementary to the country implementation

of the health sector. The development of the different SWAp committees and the DP
participation in the SWAp was instrumental in the consolidation of the system and management
of donor funded support. This was a critical efficiency gain for the MoHSW as it reduced the
operating costs for managing different donor funded activities. In addition, the annual review
and planning sessions optimized the planning cycle and eliminated duplication on planning.
The issue of financial and procurements management was part of the broader agreement through
the memorandum of understanding between the DP and the MoHSW and allowed the DP to
provide a joint intervention plan that helped build MoHSW capacity and contributed to
strengthening both financial and procurement processes.

59.     Returns to project investment - Health System Strengthening: The HSDP focus was on
delivery of quality health interventions through strengthening of the health system. The project
contributed to increased integration of activities at service delivery level and increased the
human resource base for effective health service delivery. The project developed and
strengthened the management capacity of health at different levels of care through training and
recruitment and supportive supervision both from the central level and the zonal centers.
Innovative initiatives were being put in place to promote retention.

60.     Returns to project investment - Health Financing and PPP: The implementation of the
HSSP III 2009- 2015 is supported by the additional financing of the HSDP for the first two
years and is taking more focus on the implementation of the health financing and PPP. The
MoHSW recognizes the importance of these two facets of health implementation. Even though
there are some challenges in the scaling up of the health financing initiatives in the HSDP II, the
HSSP III takes up from where the HSSP II left and consolidates on the gains, leveraging on the
lessons leant to ensure the health sector financing is sustainable over time. Coming from a
traditional culture of total government health care financing and negligible PPP, the progress
attained so far lays the foundation of taking these two areas of health care provision to the next
level.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

61.     The overall Project outcome is rated Satisfactory. The implementation of the HSDP II
through its support for the SWAp has contributed greatly to the success attained in the delivery
of health service in Tanzania. Different reviews and studies have concluded strongly that the
implementation of the HSDP II contributed greatly to the reduction of infant and child mortality
in Tanzania. The indicators on infant and child mortality show great improvement and so does
the overall capacity for health care delivery at all levels of the health system. Management
capacity has been strengthned and clinical care has been strongly integrated into routine health
service delivery. Monitoring and evaluation through both routine and systematic surveys has
been strengthened; Tanzania MoHSW boosts of having a comprehensive data base on health
indicators. These success through are not without challenges especially in human resources for
health and funding allocation to the districts given the increasing population and stagnant
allocation of resources per capita at district level. These challenges do not in any way take
away the success the HSDP II has contributed to improving health service delivery in Tanzania.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

62.     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: The HSDP 2000-2011
was designed to be socially sensitive to cater to the general population of Tanzania. The
positive social impact of the project was its focus on women, children, and other vulnerable
groups who were to preferentially benefit from the health services to be supported; its
orientation towards the financing and strengthening of district and other peripheral health
services and periodic stakeholder consultations through the annual review of sector performance.
The project also focused on actions at the household and community level. The social costs of
HIV/AIDS were addressed through the MAP projects which run concurrently with this project.
The MAP project also addressed AIDS orphans, supported mitigation efforts including those by
NGOs and community organizations. The project also focused on improving general health
insurance through the NHIF and community health fund.

63.      Institutional Change/Strengthening: The overall design of the HSDP II hinges on
sustainability and long term institutional strengthening. For Tanzania, the HSDP II and APL II
and the two AF have contributed greatly to overall implementation of health and the attainment
of favorable health outcomes at all levels. It has contributed to an improvement in human
resources for health. Appreciably, even though this area still remains with a number of
challenges; the MoHSW has shown great commitment to improving this area which is core to
effective service delivery. Another area that has benefited within the institution frame work is
the strengthening of both the fiduciary and procurement unit of the MoH. Over 20 procurement
officers have been recruited to support the MoH and project specific procurements. Training in
financial management and staff recruitment has continued through the life of the project. This
has also extended to the regions and provinces. Monitoring and evaluation has been core to the
demonstration of results in the HSDP II. This has received great focus for both routine HMIS
and specific health and disease peogramme surveys. Capacity building especially for HMIS is
still required and this has been recognized given the priority HMIS has taken in the HSSP III.
The HSDP II has contributed to overall strengthening of regional and district based planning.
This is long term institutional strengthening contributing to better allocation and utilization of
resources.      Given the nature of implementation of the HSDP II, it has also contributed to
streamlining the coordination of implementing health between the MoHSW and PMO-RALG.
This is an ongoing process and the HSSP III focuses on strengthening this coordination further.

64.    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative): The reorganization
in Health delivery has highlighted the need for other players within the sector to complement
government efforts. The evolution of the PPP, though still having challenges, is creating an
environment for growth and diversity in health delivery. The Government should be able to
provide leadership through streamlining the process of partnership involvement. This also


                                               26
applies to health financing. The country is barely able to implement NHIF and CHF effectively.
The level of disbursement from the NHIF is very low and the CHF is barely functional. The
current rate of recruitment of the CHF is less than 30%. This implies that the actual risk
protection being intended for communities is not being realized thereby negatively impacting
health care access and utilization especially in poor communities. The HSSP III takes this as a
priority in ensuring that the processes and activities leading to increased uptake of health
financing are favorable and easy to implement. Pay for performance is a vital component for
health financing but its implementation has yet to be realized.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

65.        Neither Stakeholder workshop nor beneficiary survey was undertaken.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

66.     Risk to attainment of project development outcomes is rated Low. The major risks
as defined on the risk assessment of the HSDP are highlighted in the risk table in the annex.
The major ones relate to inadequate human resources for health, lack of government
commitment to the SWAp, donor fatigue to the SWAp, fiduciary and procurement challenges.
The impact of HIV on the work force was greatly mitigated through the MAP. As the project
was implemented it also supported two AF to complement on the budget shortfall and target
programme specific intervention both malaria and nutrition. This added another risk on
fiduciary management. The project mitigation measures were well carried out as evidenced in
the write up; government commitment continued with apparent increase in per capita allocation,
more partners were welcomed into the basket, the number of human resources trained and
recruited was unprecedented, fiduciary and procurement strengthening was done. All legal
covenants were adhered to. These actions positively mitigated against many risks identified
during project development and contributed to keeping the attainment of PDO outcomes low.

      5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

           5.1 Bank Performance

67.     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Quality at entry is rated
Satisfactory The Project was a continuation from the first APL in the HSDP I 200-2003. The
quality at entry of the second APL was rated satisfactory by QAG. The ICR of the first APL
was rated satisfactory. The lessons from the first APL were incorporated in the design of the
second APL. The process of project development was consultative between GoT and the DP.
The risks and mitigation measures of the first APL were amplified and appropriate clauses in
the new memorandum of understanding were included especially those that support
procurement and fiduciary processes. The results framework was adapted from the HSSP II for
which the second APL was supporting as part of the HSDP 2000-2011. M&E was identified as
a weakness in the first APL and this was strengthned in the second APL as exemplified by
number of health surveys and functionality of the HMIS19. Given the nature of the HSDP, the

19
  . It is important to note the HMIS is yet to be fully developed, however the HSDP II contributed to its strengthening and ensure that it
received core focus in the development of HSSP III POW.



                                                                       27
use of APL as the lending instrument was appropriate because of the magnitude of health
reforms and the commitment required from both developments partners and GOT.

68.     Quality of Supervision: The quality of supervision is rated satisfactory. A
Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) were adopted for the project M&E design.
This involved the participation of the key DP, GOT (MoHSW, MOFEA and PORALG) and
other stakeholders. As described previously, the M&E for the project was complex not only
looking at the results framework indicators but also the implementation arrangement between
GoT and the DP. To this effect, a number of working committees were formed that facilitated
the review of different aspects of implementation of the HSDP. The MTEF and HSSP II
provided a framework for assessing project implementation progress. The project was also
monitored through quarterly Basket Finance Committee meetings, Annual Health Sector
reviews, the SWAp and Basket Fund (BFC), the annual review of comprehensive plans, annual
reports submitted by 133 councils. In addition to the administrative monitoring of the project,
sector wide monitoring on attaining intervention specific outcomes was done through the
routine system as well as through the specific surveys. The project was a category “B? for
environmental issues and mostly focused on the implementation of safe medical waste disposal.
The project revised the management of safe medical waste in 2007 and was monitored as part of
the overall sector monitoring.

69.    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: In view, of the satisfactory
quality at entry and satisfactory quality of supervision overall Bank performance is rated
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

70.     Government Performance: Government Performance is rated Satisfactory. The
HSDP 2000-2011 was the MoHSW sector programme for delivery of health in the country
through the HSSP II supported by the PRS. The implementation of health interventions and
other cross sector activities of the HSDP II at district level were done through the PMO RALG
under the Prime Minister office. The GoT‟scommitment to health can be seen through the
increased coordination efforts at all levels especially at district level in ensuring that health is
part of the broader development agenda. The GoT has annually been increasing the overall
allocation to health even though the total percentage for health sector spending has remained
almost the same if not decreasing. This could be the effect of population growth and the
growing health budget. The overall per capita health expenditure has been gradually increasing
from 8.98% in 2005/06 to 9.63% in 2008/09 and 12.31% for the 2010/11. Implementation of
the vertical programmes such as malaria and HIV has been integrated at health facility.
However, challenges still remain in optimizing this coordination at all levels. Government and
PMO-RALGs commitment of strengthening council level health services, supported by the
upgrading of staff skills, and coupled with some improvements in centrally provided services
(and the contribution of strengthened national vertical programs) show GOTs commitment to
ensuring the HSDP was successfully implemented. These actions underscore the commitment
of government to prioritizing health. The GOT as part of the commitment agreed not to move to
the PRSC given the fact that the condition of increased and sustained government allocation to
the health was not entirely met at the time that the shift was to occur.



                                                28
71.     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:                   Implementing Agencies
performance is rated Satisfactory. The MoHSW, PMO RALG (LGA) and MOFED were the
main implementing agencies of the project. Commitment was very high within MoHSW as
was evidenced by the creation of the Health Sector Reform Secretariat which was the secretariat
to the SWAp; the participation and leadership in the many different committees that were
formed to support the implementation and monitoring of the project.           The Sector-Wide
Approach Committee, chaired by the PS/MOH, provided a forum for coordination of all the
donor-assisted activities/programs (both joint and parallel financing) in the health sector. In
addition MoHSW continued to ensure that all recommendations from the DP through the
various committees were addressed. This is recognized from the efforts made in improving the
level of compliance to meeting different legal covenants especially as regards to fiduciary and
procurement issues.         The Agencies ensured that SWAp was effectively implemented,
coordinated and that the project met all its legal convents albeit with some challenges in the
early years of the project implementation. There was strengthened monitoring through, the
increased number of reviews and surveys to document evidence of what was happening on the
ground.

72.      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Borrower Performance
is satisfactory due to the fact that the project was very challenging, with complex implementing
arrangements. Both GOT and the Implementing Agencies substantially performed in ensuring
the success of the project as evidenced by the ISR Ratings (see data sheet), achievement of
good indicators in almost all programme areas designed to show progress notably reduction in
both childhood and maternal mortality rates(annex and data sheet), improvement in
immunization and family planning methods including the improvement in pro poor hospital
access as evidenced by further reduction in the ratio of the IMR of the poorest to highest
quartile. The challenges experienced in procurement and fiduciary management especially in
the start of the project were noted but these by the end of the project were fully overcome. In
addition, health in Tanzania is implemented in a multi-sectoral manner, through different line
ministries and structures at different levels; the effort of coordinating this level of complexity to
attain the evidenced results is in itself a remarkable achievement.

6.     Lessons Learned

 73.    The HSDP II has been contributory to overall health strengthening in Tanzania. Its
design and implementation GOT owned and supports key interventions of the HSSP II.
Through the implementation of the project, a number of project specific lessons have been
established. Below are some of the lessons that were learned.

The Health SWAp:

a) At the time of project implementation, the SWAp contributed to greater sector coherence
   and consistency, which secured higher levels of both domestic and external financial
   resources for health throughout the implementation period. Compared to the set of loosely
   or non-coordinated projects and programs previously in place, SWAp delivered real
   improvement in sector coordination and dialogue.




                                                 29
b) The SWAp through the implementation of the HSSP has led to the strengthening of joint
   annual review and a strong Inter ministerial involvement. (MoHSW, PORALG, Ministry of
   Local government and other line ministries. This was especially important for the SWAp to
   function effectively in a decentralized manner given that the provision of health care at
   district level is through local government.    The management of the SWAp has brought
   financial discipline given the collective decision making required from the Health
   Management Teams at Regional and District level. The District Basket contributes to
   efficient implementation of health services to ensure effective delivery at district level
   where the basket is seen as the most reliable source of funding for operations. But the
   SWAp and basket partners focused their dialogue much on the MOHSW, even for issue of
   resource management and implementation in the district which are the prime responsibility
   of the PMO RALG.
c) The SWAp has contributed to the alignment of both DP and Government budgeting and
   accounting through a single system thereby contributing to a reduction in transaction costs.
d) Central, Programmatic and SWAp funding are essential for implementation of health
   services in raising health indicators as exemplified by funding for NMCP Nutrition and
   HIV/AIDS program.

Role of discretionary resources:

e) Non-salary, discretionary resources at local/facility level seem to have played a critical role
   in the results attained. It is an important lesson as we continue to consider supporting such
   resource allocations.

Human Resources for Health:

f) Even though Human resources for health remain a challenge in terms of numbers, the
   SWAp has contributed to increasing both the numbers of qualified DMO and other health
   officers through extensive capacity building efforts. However, it is evident that capacity
   building alone will not meet the need of the MoHSW except through collaborative efforts
   with the civil service department of planning and the implementation of policies that favour
   work and retention of officers in the civil service. The challenges need to be more
   thoroughly appreciated, as repeatedly we set targets that rely too heavily upon improved
   HRH and which aim for improvements which may be unrealistic

Health Sector Development

g) Strengthening of Client Systems: The implementation of the SWAp through the HSSP II
   contributed greatly to the design of HSSP III. The goals and target indicators of HSSP III
   are derived from HSSP II within the context of continued implementation of the SWAp. It
   has allowed the prioritization of health care delivery and ensured that those areas that did
   not fully progress within the HSSP II were prioritized in the HSSP III.

Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

74.     First foremost we extent our gratitude to the World Bank for the support they provided
to the HSDPII and as it was supporting the HSSPII its extension and initial activities of HSSPIII.

      •   The Original Project Development Objectives are spelled out clearly and are the same as
          the one in the original jointly approved signed document. They were never revised
          except for the number of indicators.
      •   The project was designed to support overall health reforms within the context of SWAp.
          We agree that the design had great strengths in taking health as close to the people as it
          was implemented mostly by the districts through the process of devolution. It broadened
          the interactions between various implementers such as MOHSW, MOF, PMORALG,
          Private and Donor community.
      •   The design emphasised Govt ownership of programmes, focused on building the health
          systems and capacity away from the vertically managed donor projects.
      •   We agree with the assessment outcomes on effectiveness and relevance of objectives,
          Design and implementations.
      •   On the health sector financing particularly at District level the report says of mostly
          reliance on health basket; irregular disbursement of bloc grants, ceiling tied with the
          disbursement make rational management of resources difficult. Inconsistent of medical
          supplies from MSD this needs to be addressed or rather explained.
      •   Results Framework analysis shows that all the 6 PDO indicators their target values were
          achieved. While the intermediate outcome indicators only five out of 23 indicators did
          not meet the targets. These results can be compared with the ones from the Govt
          prepared ICRR document so as to avoid inconsistencies.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Main Objective:

77.     The long-term objective of the Program (2000-2011) is to improve access, utilization,
quality, and financing of health services through increased efficiency and effectiveness in use
and allocation of resources, to maximize impacts on health outcomes, especially among the poor,
women, and children.

Health Structure and implementation:

78.     Tanzania has 21 administrative regions that comprise 113 districts, 133 councils, and
approximately 10,342 villages. The overall health service delivery structure is comprised of PHC
services, public and private health care providers, as well as council health services, Regional
health services and national services. Health services in Tanzania are delivered through a
decentralized system whereby local Governments (under the Prime Minister‟s Office–Regional
Administration and Local Government, or PMO-RALG) are responsible for service delivery
through dispensaries, health centers, and district hospitals. It was noted that the implementation
of the decentralization policy is still the subject of major efforts under the Local.

79.     Tanzania has a total of 4,679 dispensaries and 481 health centers, located throughout the
country. There are 18 regional hospitals that take referrals from the 55 GOT-owned district
hospitals, 13 FBO hospitals, and eight consultancy and specialized hospitals, also spread across
the country. In addition, there are 86 GOT-owned, parastatal, and private hospitals at the first
referral level.

80.     The MOHSW collaborates closely with PMO-RALG and the LGAs, which fund and
oversees all district-based health activities. The MOHSW relies on LGAs to implement new
policies, allocate resources, deliver health services, and provide health data. In addition to
working with LGAs, the MOHSW also collaborates with several other ministries: the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs (MOFEA) that provides funding, and the Ministry of Higher
Education, Science and Technology (MHEST) that trains health workers. Government Reform
Program II was developed to iron out lingering challenges in the separation of roles and
responsibilities between PMO-RALG and other ministries, including the MOHSW. It was
pointed out that a number of challenges in coordination and implementation at LGA exist and
efforts were being made through various government initiatives (some with development partner
support) to strengthen LGAs‟ ability to deliver services by improving their management capacity,
programmatic and financial accountability and to streamline working relationships between
ministries.

Delivery of health care at different levels:

81.     Central Levels: The central level provided guidance through the development of relevant
policy guidelines and documents. It lobbied for increased health funding with the result that
overall health financing increased over time. The total health expenditure as a percentage of
GDP shows an increase from 3.8 in 2004 to 6.8 in 2008, which for 2008, was over the sub
Saharan Africa average of 5.6 and low income countries group of 5.1. There has also been an


                                               33
increase in per capita health expenditure over the years from 7.42 in 2004/05 to 13.46 in 2008/920.
In addition the central level contributed to increased recruitment and training of health workers
across all levels, strengthened supervision to regional and district levels and also providing
support for monitoring and evaluation.

82.      Regional Level: The Regional Health Management teams have been strengthened and are
responsible and hold accountable Council Health Management Teams (CHMT) within the health
system. CHMTs prepare the CCHP on an annual basis; these plans hold the CHMTs and their
councils accountable to the central health authority and their constituents. Regional capacity has
been strengthened with increase in human resource capacity building, and provision of technical
assistance to the CHMT , the strengthening of the inspectorate function, performance audits,
introducing a quality assurance program (including client satisfaction assessment), supporting
districts in data collection, data management and decision-making, strengthening district capacity
for Supportive supervision and facilitating inter-district exchange of experiences. However,
even though the Regional levels can be said to be have done well in supporting the districts and
other lower levels, the regularity and frequency of this support was poor. In addition, the
regional levels themselves have challenges in capacity and this also affects the quality of
supervision provided to districts. Human resource availability remains low and the availability of
funds outside the health basket to support monitoring activities is very minimal.

83.     Improved District Health Services: The district level is the focal point of health care
delivery. All health services that impact on national indicators especially the MDG/MKUKUTA
targets are implemented at this level. The district level benefited from increased funding and
capacity strengthening. Over the lifetime of the project, district health funding increased from
$0.50 per capita to $2.50. All District Medical Officers in the country are Public Health trained.
The District Medical Officers (DMOs) develop work plans with the support of the Council
Health Management Team. The DMO also runs the district accounts and manage resources from
the health centers. District health is implemented through the Councils and the Ministry offers
only supervisory and technical expertise. Even through funding of vertical programmes remains
earmarked with significant vertical implementation of specific program actions,                 the
implementation of such programs at district level uses the structure that have been put in place to
support delivery of health care, through health centres and community health posts.
Implementation of curative health services is well integrated.

84.     Zonal Training Centers (ZTC): A number of zonal centers of excellence were
established across the different zones in Tanzania. The ZTCs helped train all CHMTs and
RHMTs in using the CCHP planning guidelines. ZTCs are offering short courses in Council
Health Management, Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, and also guidance to
develop business plans. The challenge remains as inadequate funding and number in training
staff hampers the effective implementation ZTC activities. Especially the lack of resources to
conduct onsite monitoring activities of the Council Health Management teams in their catchment
areas.

Health Systems and Disease Programmes

85.     Malaria: The NMCP was supported through the first Additional Financing of 2006 (over
40 percent - US$25 million of the Additional Financing). Support was mainly for the
procurement of LLINs and retreatment kits Results show that scaled-up efforts to prevent
malaria have led to confirmed reductions in malaria incidence21. Prevention efforts have relied
mainly on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), which has substantially increased over
the past several years. Through this process the NMCP was able to raise coverage of ITN/LLIN
home ownership from 39.2% in 2007/8 to 63.47% (draft 2010 TDHS), utilization of in children
less than 5 years increased from 25.7 (2007/8 -MHIVIS) to 64.1% (Draft TDHS 2009/10).
Malaria treatment remains a preserve of the broader health system and has been integrated in the
normal health facility related activities of health care delivery. Progress in this area is also noted
as evidence from the result shown in table 7 below. The NMCP resource comes from direct
central financing and other partnerships support like the GFATM, bilateral and multilateral
agencies. The Bank financing for the first AF (2006) was meant to meet a specific need for
improving the availability of ITN treated with insecticide.

86.     HIV: The MoHSW working with its sister ministry of PO-RALG established treatment
centers in all districts in the country. VCT services are readily available at health centre level.
Treatment centers are found in all tertiary and most district hospitals. Some health centers with
adequate staff are also able to offer HIV counseling and treatment services. The availability of
laboratory equipment in district hospitals and health centres is hampering the establishments of
treatment centres. HIV services have been integrated and are being supported by both direct

sectoral wide implications of HIV/AIDS implementations remain as a strongly vertical activity.
Community HIV interventions go on as part of district outreach services within the broader
context of community health delivery. Table 8 highlights the progress in a number of HIV core
indicators. The increase of ART coverage and HIV testing services is evidence to the integrated
activities district and health centre level.

87.      Reproductive Health Implementation: The second AF contributed to the financing of
improving Reproductive Health indicators through procurement of obstetric equipment. The
current picture is one of increasing utilization of health facilities for delivery as indicated by the
percentage of births delivered by skilled personnel of 43.4% in 2005 (WDI) to 51.0% shown in
2009/10 TDHS even though this still remains sub optimal. Less progress has been observed in
total fertility rate (TFR) reductions of 5.8 seen in 2007/08 (HIV/Mal S) and 5.4 in 2009/10
(TDHS) of which further improvements requires concentrated government attention.                  The
emergency obstetrical care (EmOC) equipment included in the additional financing should
contribute to improvements delivery in health facilities. For contraceptive practices indicators,
the overall uptake in Tanzania is increasing from 26.4% in 2005 to 34% in 2009/2010 TDHS.
The apparent dichotomy between contraception rate increase and the relative little decrease in
fertility rate is can be attributed to a combination of factors; behavioral, social economic and
cultural. Figures 14 highlights progress in RH intervention indicators. Injection, condoms and
the pill remain the main methods of choice. ANC first attendance is generally very high with
those meeting criteria for focused ANC at 61.5%.

88.     Figure 15 shows progress in hospital delivery by region. The proportion of health facility
deliveries across regions will country average of 52% in 2008 an increase of 1.996 percentage
points to that of 2007. The national average clearly shows there is need for more effort in
improving uptake to over 60%. With increased uptake of ANC before 16 weeks gestation, it is
more likely that it will contribute to increase in health facility deliveries. This however, will
depend on the level of community confidence the community has in the facilities.

89.      Nutrition: The project provided funding support to strengthen central level fortifications
of micro nutrients and the strengthening of the Nutrition and food commission. Reductions in
malnutrition are on track to be achieved as shown from the Figure 16 below. Vitamin A
supplementation exceeded the target 50%. Current level is 60.3%. The commission developed
policy guidelines for both private sector and public sector involvement in fortification activities;
these guidelines have been finalized and gazetted. The actual fortification process was
challenging due to Government of Tanzania and private sector disagreement on modalities of
implementation including the fortification processes, type of fortificants to be allowed,
micronutrients premixes to be used and development of the nutrition policy. This stalled the
procurement process and hence the AF financing could not dispense fully during the time of the
project. The National fortification programme benefitted greatly from the HDSP II and will
contribute to Tanzania being the one country in east and central Africa with the highest number
of fortifying industries.

90.    IMCI and Immunization Activities: This has increased tremendously across the country
from the baseline levels. Targets for DPT –HB3, BCG, and measles have essentially been met.


                                                               37
DPT coverage shows an increase from 83% in 2007(WHO) to 88% in 2009/10 (TDHS) Even
though the target MDG 2015 of 90% was not attained, achievement of 88% is substantial
progress towards attainment of MDG 2015 target. Figure 17 reflects the yearly trends in DPT-
HB3 immunization. IMIC is being implemented in all districts and is contributing to rational
management of childhood illness at community level. The community component of the IMCI is
contributing to improving community knowledge on health seeking behavior especially the
management of malaria and other febrile illness at community level. This again exemplifies the
scaled up activities of health service delivery at district level and in communities.

91.    Tuberculosis (TB): The program has surpassed the global target set at 85%. . This is an
improvement from 2007 where the rate was 84.7%. The current rate of 87.8% is excellent
thought it poses challenges especially in ensuring that this level of success is maintained. Figure
18 highlights the regional rates and total. The progress is entirely uniform signifying the
program conceited efforts at moving the implementation of TB interventions in all Tanzania. In
addition this provides evidence for the system‟s capacity to deliver within the context of the
SWAp.

92.   Medicines Procurement Supply Management: The majority of medicines and supplies
(90 percent) are procured using the government budget (including budget support from


                                                        38
development partners) through the MSD. Approximately 53 percent of medical products were
procured with government funding in 2006-2007.          The remainder of the medical products,
particularly those funded through non government sources, is procured through international
procurement agents. The MSD follows the Public Procurement Act no 21 of 2004, procuring
through international competitive bidding. The processing time takes approximately 9-12 months.
The MSD‟s procurement functions have been assessed by the Tanzania Public Procurement
Regulatory Authority, as well as by the Global Fund, both provided very positive reviews.
Health facilities then draw their drugs from the MSD as per allocation from central government.
When this allocation is exhausted, the facilities have to procure from outside using block grant
and/or user Fees and from the district health basket which by the close of the project had an
allocation of $0.25 per capita for medicines and other medical supplies. Figure 19 shows the
distributors of pharmaceuticals in Tanzania. Figure 20 highlights the availability of commonly
used medicines by type of health facility.

93.     Overall, it should be noted that the HSDP II supported the strengthening of health
systems. This facilitated in the delivery of interventions at all levels in an integrated manner.
The results from all the vertical programmes and the effort made by the different health care
providers and the coordination of the different ministries especially at district level emphasize
the synergy which the HSDP II provided in harmonizing implementation and ensuring that key
health interventions are integrated within the overall health system. The HSDP II actualized the
implementation of the HSSP II and significantly contributed to the successful attainments of
PDO and other health indicators. Through the HSDP II the HSSP III was initiated to ensure
continuity in the scale up of health interventions and the strengthening of the SWAp.

Summary on Outputs by Component

94.    Component One: Improving District Level Health Services

Objective: Improve District Level Health Services

Activities:
        Implement quality assurance program (management, training, supervision);
        Emphasizing the defined essential health interventions package through the council
            planning, budgeting and reporting process.
        Integrate specified HIV/AIDS activities into service delivery at all levels: district
            hospital, health centers, dispensaries, ward and village level.
        Enhance health promotion activities through multi-sectoral networking at district and
            Ward level, and increase advocacy for healthy household and community behaviors
            through dispensary and health centers.
        Include epidemics preparedness and response in district planning and management;
        Environmental and occupational health management including health care waste
            management.
        Based upon the skills assessment which will be done at regional level, districts will
            develop human resources in-service training plans.
        Strengthen approaches to service agreements (ie, contracting with NGOs and private
            sector).
        Facilitate the establishment of Health Facility Committees and the Council Health
        Increase accountability by publishing annual district health budgets and informing
            facilities about their annual budgets.
        Publish annual district health performance data, and discuss with health staff and
            communities.
        Improve equity of resource allocation: Ensure fairness in resource allocation in terms
            of equity.
        Support District Hospital rehabilitation.

Outputs on Improving District Level Health Services

          All 116 districts managed by qualified DMO with Public Health.
          All districts and `133 councils using CCHP as basis of resource allocation and
           activity implementation.


                                               40
          Almost all Councils and Districts have Financial Management Committees that define
           how council resources are used.
          Regular AUDITs of council as per MOU between central government and councils is
           conducted.
          Some council have started the process of publicly displaying the financial
           management reports through public media.
          DHMT prioritizes training through both in-service (seven zonal centres) and on the
           job training.
          Council and DHMT coordination meetings as part of overall coordination taking
           place regularly at least monthly.
          The use of treatment protocols and guidelines and increased number of trained staff in
           institutions helping in improving delivery of quality of care.
          PPP still a major challenge but a number of new health facilities being registered
           through the initiative.
          Implementation of the CHF still a major challenge but some council especially those
           under the WB pilot scheme moving forward.
          Epidemic and preparedness control plans part of the CCHP.
          District Hospital rehabilitation being financed through both block grants and basket
           funds. Basket funds seen as most reliable source for rehabilitation works. However
           districts are hampered by line item budget ceilings.

95.      The DHMT is the focus of health care delivery. Through its structure of health centres
and health posts, the general community is able to access health care. The quality of care at the
districts is influenced by the leadership provided by the District Medical Officer who administers
and supervises all health activities. District funding is through the local council by way of
District Health Plans which form the basis for the budget. Implementation of all activities at
district level is totally integrated from the hospital through to the health centres. This activity is
under LGA authorities with supervision from District Health Boards. The MoHSW provides a
coordination, supervision and monitoring of activities in health. Community Health agents at
health centre level provide the community prevention and behavior change activities. MCH,
Malaria, HIV, and TB actions are all provided as one long continuum of care. The HSDP II
through the implementation of the HSSP II contributed significantly to improving the delivery of
service at district level. It is important to note that overall district performance has greatly
improved as evidenced from the number and quality of reports reaching the Central level from
the districts. The level of coordination between the districts and the councils has also improved
over time. The DMO is an important member of the Council Management Team that looks at
development issues in the Council designated area (district) of which health forms a critical
component.

96.   Component Two:           Strengthening the Management of Secondary & Tertiary
Hospital Care

Objective: Strengthening the Management of Secondary & Tertiary Hospital Care
Activities
        Develop a cadre of hospital managers.




                                                 41
          Mitigate the burden on hospital staff of increased work and hazards related to
           HIV/AIDS.
          Accelerate the establishment of Hospital Boards and operationalize the legal
           framework to support this.
          Have Hospital Strategic Plans and Operational plans.
          Deliver package o f quality services, as defined by national norms and standards.
          Provide specific quality services for HIV/AIDS patients.
          Prevention, counseling and support to HIVIAIDS patients.
          Improve emergency and epidemics preparedness and response.
          Undertake infrastructure rehabilitation and preventive maintenance with a strong
           local participation element.

Output for Strengthening the Management of Secondary & Tertiary Hospital Care
       Hospital manager cadre developed in all hospitals.
       Hospital management committee formed in all hospitals.
       All government hospitals now functioning under Hospital Boards.
       Hospital strategic plans providing guidance on funding and implementation of
          hospital activities.
       Hospitals have hospital financial committees which discuss the management of
          hospital funds.
       Increased support from Central level on Hospital monitoring and support supervision
          visits on going on a regular basis.
       All Hospitals providing a package of clinical interventions as defined by national
          norms and standards.
       All tetially hospitals providing HIV treatment, counseling and testing facilities.

97.    All tertiary and referral hospitals provide treatment and diagnostic services for HIV and
other communicable diseases. Most of the secondary hospitals also able to provide HIV
treatment service. The hospital strategic and operational plans are the basis of hospital activity
implementation. These define the level of funding and are managed by the hospital management
committee. Secondary and tertiary Hospital rehabilitation is being financed through both block
grants and basket funds. The strengthening of tertiary health institutions is contributing to
providing higher level curative activities. The overall management of the hospital is under the
hospital management board. The various hospital management committees are helping in
streaming the implementation of priority hospital activities and the provision of quality care.
Hospital financing and utilization of hospital grants is overseen by the hospital financal
committee. Hospital financing is done through block grants, user fees, and the health basket.
Hospital rehabilitation is undertaken as per hospital plans through block grants and basket funds.
Training of various hospital cardres is done through the Ministry of Health central support and
cuts across all disciplines. The current level of development in service delivery in both
secondary and tertally level hospitals is another example of the HSDP II at work.

       agree on the composition of the RHMT; and PMO RALG.
      MOH will harmonize technical management guidelines.
      Strengthen Zonal Training Centers teamwork on continuing education.
      Strengthen supportive supervision and of logistical support on regular basis.

102. Outputs Strengthening the Central Level Stewardship Role (standard setting, quality
control, financing and human resource development for the sector

      Development of guiding policy documents across disciplines.
           o Malaria
           o TB
           o HIV
           o STI
           o MCH
           o Nutrition etc
      Strengthening of the HMIS component for data collection and improving the quality of
       surveys (Malaria /HIV, DHS, etc).
      Increasing the human resource base through pre service intakes and in-service training



                                              43
      Up grading and strengthening the capacity of qualified medical personnel through further
       training (MPH and other clinical disciplines).
      Strengthening of Zonal centres (6) for in service capacity building.
      Strengthening the role of Central to Region, to district supervision for improved
       performance and on the job training.
      Strengthening of the implementation of sector reform as evidenced from the development
       of the HSSP III to ensure that the gains of HSSP II are sustained.
      Provision of technical guidance to council and PMO RALG in the establishment of
       guidelines and standard for establishment of health teams at both regional and district
       level.

103. MOHSW has continued engagement with government in advocating for increased
resources to meet the increasing demand for financing health care. Government commitment to
financing health has continued to be exhibited through continued increase in health spending in
nominal terms even though this has fallen short of the 15% Abuja target for health and also
reducing per-capita spending, which can be attributed to the increase in the population need as
well as the adverse global financial climate. The technical support provided by central level in
supporting regions and district councils has helped in ensuring that the devolution of tasks to
lower levels continues smoothly. The capacity developed at council in administration and
financial management is laying the foundation for future and further devolution of resources to
councils.

104. The HSDP II has provided substantial support for the central level to ensure that it
provides support to different levels, strengthens the human resource base, and improves
coordination among councils and RHMT/DHMT to allow for effective health delivery in a
coordinated manner.       All vertical programs have well defined objectives, program plans
supported by well defined policy documents and guidelines to guide implementation at all levels.
The HMIS and LMIS is cardinal to effective delivery of health care as it provides evidence of
what is happening on the ground. Tanzania has invested tremendously in the implementation of
standalone surveys to complement data that cannot be obtained through the HMIS. The
government has also prioritized human resources for health within the health sector to ensure
capacity in the delivery of health services at all levels. This is also reflected in the HSSP III as it
is pivotal in making sure that services provided remain of good quality. The strengthening of
M&E institutions has been cardinal in getting to showcase progress made in the implementing
the HSDP II.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

BACKGROUND

105. A.          Economic State: Tanzania has shown good progress in economic growth.
Tanzania has a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of US$623 having almost doubled from
5-years ago. This is partly sparked by the expansionary fiscal policies of 2000 and sustained by
strong growth in tax revenues, large debt relief and significant growth in foreign aid. GDP
growth rate has however slowed down in recent times (from 7.4% in 2005 to 6.0% in 2010)
following the global economic crisis of 2009. Current inflation estimates are at 9.9% having
gradually increased since 2005, at which time it was reported at 5%. However, projections show
that it will return to mid-2000 rates in the coming years. Current account deficit has increased
(averaging at about 9.7% between 2010 and 2013) driven by high imports and is no longer fully
covered by foreign aid, and is dependent on foreign direct investment flows.
   a) Its literacy and labor force participation rate is encouraging. Most of the population
      lives in rural areas (74%, 2009). 78% of the population above 15 years were employed,
      and mostly in the informal sector. Literacy rate is at 73% and above regional averages,
      although enrollment of girls at primary school is high, it declines for secondary schooling.
   b) However, inequity remains high, as poverty levels have not changed much, as 33.6%
      (2007) of Tanzania‟s population lives below poverty levels. More poor lived in rural
      areas: poverty head count ratio was 16.4 in Dar-es-salaam, 24.1 in other urban areas, and
      37.6 in rural areas.

106.   B.     Demographic and Epidemiological Status

   a) Age dependency ratios are high, and effort required in sustaining fertility reductions.
      The population is at 43.2 million with a population growth rate of 2.5% in 2010 (having
      decreased from 3.0% in 2004-5). Total fertility rate however still remains high at 5.4
      (2010). Women of childbearing age make up about 21.6% of the population, while
      children under-14 years make up 47.1% of the population. Aged population (above 60-
      years) is at 6.3%. Age dependency ratio (an indicator of the economic responsibility of
      adults in their productive years) is at 107 in 2010, and indicates a high burden.
   b) Communicable disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the country.
      Policies and programs are in place, offering cost-effective interventions.
   c) Public health environment is below regional averages and below averages of other low
      income countries. Fifty four percent of the population has access to clean water and
      which is below regional averages (SSA average is 60%) and below countries with
      comparative incomes (LIC average is 64%). Further, 24% of population has access to
      improved sanitation facilities. More children were reported to have diarrhea in 2010
      (14.5%, DHS) than in 2004-5 (12.6%, DHS), a consequence of low access to clean water
      and sanitation.
   d) Malaria is a major public health concern. It is a leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality, and both children under-5 years and pregnant women are among the high-risk
      group. About 40% of outpatient care is for malaria treatment. There is an insignificant
      change in prescription of antimalarials: of children under5 with fever, 60% received
      antimalarials in 2010, compared to 58% in 2004-5.



                                               45
   e) HIV-AIDS is a concern in most of SSA, including Tanzania. HIV and Malaria Indicator
      Survey in mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar reported that 6% of adults (15-49 years) were
      infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (2007-08). Knowledge of AIDS is
      universal but comprehensive knowledge about AIDS is low (48%, 2010). Fifty five
      percent (2010) of pregnant women were counseled and tested and received results for
      HIV-AIDS, compared to 9% in 2004-5.

107.   C.      Health and Nutrition Status

The status on health and nutrition progress among children and women is variable. While
overall improvements are seen in child health, child nutrition shows little improvement.
Maternal health lags behind. A diagnosis shows variable results in health service use and quality.
One one-side, immunization coverage is significant, and children sleeping under ITN bednets
have improved significantly. While on the other side, public health environment has not
improved much and the incidence of diarrhea has increased. For maternal care, although,
antenatal care is universal, quality of care is variable across regional and economic lines. Use of
health facilities for delivery has changed little overall, and especially not much among the lower
wealth quintiles.

  a) Child health outcomes have improved, while maternal health outcomes show little
     improvement. Under-5 mortality has declined from 112 (2004-5) to 81 (2010) per 1,000
     live births, and is expected to be on track to meet the millennium development goal
     (MDG) targets by 2015. However, maternal mortality ratio remains high at 454 per
     100,000 live births in 2010, and is not expected to meet the MDG targets.
  b) Nutrition status lags behind among women and children. While anemia is reduced
     among women and children under-5 years, little change is seen in children underweight
     status: stunting reduced slightly from 38% (2004-5) to 35% (2010), while wasting
     increased slightly from 3% (2005) to 4% (2010). Use of iron tablets among children has
     changed little (from 38% in 2004-5 to 41% in 2010) and use of vitamin A among postnatal
     women is low (from 20% in 2004-5 to 26% in 2010).
  c) While use of health services has overall increased, inequity exists by wealth and
     regional differences. Immunization coverage was already high (81%, 2004-5) and has
     slightly improved with at least 86% children under-2 years having received DPT3 (2010).
     More children are sleeping under ITN bednets (from 16% in 2004-5 to 64% in 2010). Less
     children under-5 years are reporting acute respiratory infection, and of those who show
     symptoms, at least 71% (2010) seek treatment from a health facility, and this has
     increased from 2004-5 (51% sought treatment). However, use of skilled personnel or
     health facility for delivery show little change (47% in 2004-5 and 50% in 2010), and
     postnatal care although improved over the years remains low (13% in 2004-5 and 31%,
     2010). More of the wealthy go to public facilities to deliver (75%, 2010), while more of
     the poor deliver at home (65%, 2010). The Western zone reports the lowest delivery at a
     health facility (36%, 2010).
  d) Quality of care is variable. Among women, use of antenatal care is universal (96% in
     2010), and although overall quality of care has improved, it remains variable by wealth
     differentials and by regions: 62% pregnant women received all the necessary care at the
     health facility (e.g. blood and urine sample taken, blood pressure measured), while 53% of
     them were informed of signs of pregnancy complications (compared to 43% in 2004-5).

108. D.       Health Finance: Health expenditures in Tanzania is financed through multiple
sources: central government budgets through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare
(MoHSW), local government budgets, off-budget payments from development partners, cost-
sharing revenue, revenue from public and private insurance, and household out-of-pocket
payments.

109. Overall resources in the health sector have increased, mainly due to increased external
financing in recent times. Per capita health spending is US$24.50, and total health spending as a
percentage of GDP decreased from 7.6% (2002/03) to 5% (2005/06). In 2005/06, 28% of total
health expenditure was financed by the public sector, 44% by the development partners, and 28%
by the private sector. Household out-of-pocket expenditures took up 25% of total health
spending. There has been a significant increase in external financing largely a contribution from
the Global Fund, and subsequently a reduction in household out-of-pocket spending between
2002/03 and 2005/06. However, in absolute terms, household out-of-pocket spending increased,
while in percentage it decreased from 42% (2002/03) to 25% (2005/06).

A. Project Economic Analysis

110. The World Bank financed the Health Sector Development Project (2003-2011) in an
amount of $165 million. It is estimated that about 25% of the financing went directly towards
strengthening the health delivery system to attend to maternal and child health concerns in the
country. The project funds were spent in infrastructure, training, and other recurrent costs to
improve health service delivery nation-wide. The economic analysis here only reviews a
portion of the benefits accrued from this project, and the results are positive. The economic
analysis assumptions were that the use of services improved primarily as (i) quality of care
improved (less drug stock outs, more trained and improved access to health personnel), and (ii)
distance and therefore access to services improved.



                                                                 47
 a) As many as 50% of infant deaths are in the neonatal age group (first month of life), and
    among neonates, we generally find sepsis and respiratory distress are the leading causes of
    death, and this can be attended to at birth or immediately after birth. Among post-neonates,
    we generally find malaria, pneumonia, and dehydration due to diarrhea as the leading
    causes of death.
 b) In the economic analysis, we simulated number of deaths that would be averted for children
    and for women. Our assumptions suggested that infant deaths and especially neonatal
    deaths were averted as more births took place at health facilities, and for post-neonates as
    they received improved care that would reduce risk of ARI, and reduce risk of malaria and
    as mothers received PMTCT. The incidence of ARI reduced and more children sought care,
    and this too had a significant impact on infant death reduction. During this period, diarrhea
    incidence increased and fewer children sought appropriate care, therefore, its effect is
    lower in reducing infant deaths. Immunization coverage was already high before the
    project started, and although coverage further improved during the project, it had a small
    affect or deaths averted.
 c) Maternal deaths were also averted, as more women received quality antenatal care, and
    delivered at health facilities, and attained postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery.
    Maternal morbidity was also reduced as they sought treatment and complied with the
    treatment protocols (e.g. Vitamin A for anemia). Subsequently, fewer women needed to go
    for additional health care, and cost of treatment and travel was saved. Women‟s
    productivity was also improved as they were in better health conditions.
 d) During the project life, as many as 46,000 infant deaths were averted and 3,000 maternal
    deaths were averted. While the analysis focuses on infant and maternal deaths, many of
    these interventions should also reduce infant and maternal distress and morbidity.
    Consequently, total health benefits, as measured by a composite measure such as disability-
    adjusted life years would be significantly greater.
 e) The project reaches a positive net present value (NPV) by 2018 (or in its 13th year after
    project effectiveness), and therefore the net benefits accruing to the country are maximized
    thereafter. We find that the internal rate of return (IRR) is positive but reaches the discount
    rate level by 2019 (or at 14 years from project effectiveness). This is an acceptable
    investment. Appendix 1 provides the technical specifics of the analysis.

111. Table 11 helped assess infant deaths averted. The baseline for the causes of infant death
is taken from WHO (2006), and the information on morbidity profiles and use of services is
taken from DHS (2005, 2010). We assume that morbidity patterns and health service use patterns
affect mortality patterns. Between 2005 and 2010, we find that: (a) diarrhea incidence increased
also correlated will less children following appropriate techniques to prevent dehydration, (b)
ARI reduced, (c) PMTCT use improved. The increase in use of measles vaccines is very low,
and the use of ITN although has changed much, the malaria incidence remains high. For post-
neonatal deaths, we assume that improved quality of care will attract more children to receive
care at health facilities and post-neonatal deaths will also reduce. Post-neonatal deaths are about
47% (2006) and 51% (2010) of total infant deaths. See simulation on Table 12.3.

112. Tables 12.1 to 12.3 provide a simulation for child mortality averted. For neonatal deaths
averted, the simulation took the following assumptions: (i) quantity of institutional delivery went
up, and (ii) quality of service improved, such as use of services for institutional delivery and for
user of services. Given the project investments and improved quality of care, we assume that the
percentage delivery at health facilities will increase by about 1% per year. Given that we already
have results from the DHS for 2010, we find that to be the case. We have assumed that risk of a
neonate dying varies by the place of delivery: at health facility risk of dying is 0.012 (2005),
while at home risk of dying is at 0.05 (2005). As quality of health facility improves with
improved investment, the risk of dying at health facility also reduces (from 0.012 in 2005 to


                                                                    49
0.007 in 2010). We also assume that the project is able to improve quality of antenatal care
(which too is universal coverage) and thereby home delivery has a reduced risk of dying over the
years (from 0.05 in 2005 to 0.045 in 2010).

113. Table 12.3 estimates the cost of year of life gained (YLG) is US$ 8, and the cost per
disability adjusted life years (DALY) is US$14. A similar simulation is run for maternal deaths
averted. Maternal risk of dying when delivering at health facilities is at 0.0011, risk of dying

when delivering at home is at 0.010. Similar assumptions are made of reduced risk of dying at
health facility and under skilled attendant, a consequence of improved quality of health care.

114. Table 13 presents the costs and benefits from the project investment. It shows the
savings incurred by death or morbidity averted. For per capita health costs, the NHA per capita
health spending for that year is selected. For example, the per capita health spending was US$
24.50 in 2005, and thereafter an inflationary increase of 3% is taken. For women‟s health,
US$100 is taken for health spending savings incurred for mortality and morbidity averted.
Further, productivity gained due to improved illness is estimated using GDP per capita as the
earnings potential, with an inflationary increase of 3%. The discount rate is taken at 5% while
estimating discounted costs and benefits.

                     TANZANIA COUNTRY COMPLETION REPORT
                       Health Sector Development Project Phase 11

115. Background: During the 1990s, the health sector in Tanzania faced a period of
stagnation. Local health services were characterized by severe shortages of essential drugs,
equipment and supplies and deteriorating infrastructure and were plagued by poor management,
lack of supervision and lack of staff motivation. The sector also faced stagnating or deteriorating
hospital care. There was little cooperation in health service delivery between the public sector,
faith-based organizations, and private service providers. Health services were severely under-
funded, with public health sector spending at USD 3.46 per capita. There was also little
coordination of support to the health sector by Development Partners. The Government of
Tanzania and Development Partners responded to this situation together in a process beginning
with a joint planning mission convened by the Government in mid-decade. By 1999, this process
resulted in the first major health sector strategic plan, the Health Sector Program of Work (POW)
and an agreement that support to the health sector would take place in the framework of a Sector
Wide Approach (SWAP). The POW and subsequent Health Sector Strategic Plan 2 (HSSP2)
articulated a process of health sector reform aimed at addressing the recognizable deficiencies in
the sector and achieving specific goals and targets in health as set out in the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty
(NSGRP)/MKUKUTA).

116. Health Sector development Program: A three-phase, long-term (2000-2011) Health
Sector Development Program (HSDP) was jointly developed by the GOT and development
partners and was supported through a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP).
The long-term objective of the Program (2000-2011) was to improve access, utilization,
quality, and financing of health services through increased efficiency and effectiveness in
use and allocation of resources, to maximize impacts on health outcomes, especially among
the poor, women, and children.

117. HSDP Phase 1: The objective of Phase I (2000-2003 with an estimated cost o f US$654
million supported by a Credit of US$22 million) was to improve resource management and the
quality of health services through sector reforms and institutional capacity building. The Phase I
project focused changing the way the sector was managed and financed, and by shifting roles and
responsibilities. Particular achievements were made in decentralization, institutional capacity and
improved resource management.

118. HSDP Phase 11: The Word Bank provided credit to the United Republic of Tanzania
for the support of Health Sector Development Project Phase 11 from July 2003 to end of June
2011. The objective of the phase II project was to achieve improvements in the provision of
quality health services through continuing to support the reforms, capacity development and
improved management of resources, while placing a greater emphasis on quality. The HSDP II
Project supported the Second Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP II). The Second Phase of the
Health Sector development Program (HSDP II) continued to addresses constraints for effective I
implementation of the health interventions - namely, sector financing, human resources, logistics,
management and information systems, quality assurance, decentralization and the role of the


                                                55
private sector. The estimated cost at the time of project design was US$963 million, of which
IDA was to finance US$65 million. Of this, US$ 40 million was IDA and US$ 25 million grant.
The project had two Additional Financings from 2007-2009 for IDA US$60 million and the
second AF for 2009-2010 for IDA US$ 40 million. The total HSDP IDA financing was US$165
million (original US$65 million and US$l00 million AF), with US$125 million or 76% going to
the Health Basket. As for Phase I Project, Phase II was implemented by the Ministry of Health
(MOH) and the District Councils under the President's Office, the Regional Administration and
Local Authority (PMO-RALG). Other vertical programs which benefited from this grant were
malaria, HIV/AIDS and Nutrition and Reproductive Child Health. The project description was
derived from the MOH Second Health Sector Strategic Plan 2003-2007. This Plan was appraised
and endorsed by stakeholders at the Annual Review in April, 2003. Phase II o f this APL was to
support the first 4 years of the Strategic Plan. After that, the Bank‟s support for implementation
of the Strategic Plan and the associated MTEF would continue through the PRSC combined with
knowledge transfer, policy advice, analysis, and monitoring of both implementation and results.

119. Components of the project: The Second phase of HSDP continued to address the
constraints to effectively implementing the defined package of cost effective interventions that
are expected to respond to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Tanzania. These
constraints include sector financing, human resources, logistics, management and information
systems, quality assurance, decentralization and the role of private sector. The HSDP 11 was to
support three components briefly described below.

   a) Improving District Level Health Services: To improve the quality of health services
      delivered at this important level of implementation by Implementing quality assurance
      program (management, training, supervision), emphasizing the defined essential health
      interventions package through the council planning, budgeting and reporting process,
      Integrating specified HIV/AIDS activities into service delivery at all levels, enhancing
      health promotion activities through multi-sectoral networking at all levels.
   b) Strengthening the Management of Secondary & Tertiary Hospital Care including
      human Resources: In this component the focus was to develop a discipline and a cadre
      of hospital managers. Accelerate the establishment of Hospital Boards and operationalize
      the legal framework to support this.
   c) Strengthening the Central Level Stewardship Role: The Central level that includes the
      MOHSW and the PMORALG and the Regional levels are responsible for standard
      setting, quality control, financing and human resource development for the sector. o
      strengthen the Regional Level to be able to support quality of services at district level by
      providing managerial and technical support to districts, including emergency and
      epidemics preparedness and response. Support districts to strengthen data collection,
      data management and decision-making. Strengthen Stewardship Responsibilities of the
      regions by improving the performance of the inspectorate function and comprehensively
      analyzing skills and human resource needs at district level, training needs assessment of
      district, in collaboration with Zonal Health Resource Centers. At Central Ministries
      (MOH and PMORALG) included improving health financing, budgeting and the
      equitable allocation o f resources, Advocate for increased government allocation to health
      and Provide support to strengthening management of cost sharing, CHF and health
      insurance schemes. Further focus was to address the Human Resource crises by
      improving long-term manpower planning and invest in greater production o f staff

       distribution, motivation and retention. Institutionalize network of Zonal Health Resource
       Centers. To improve the quality of health service delivery: and promote Public-Private
       Partnerships. To strengthen monitoring and evaluation and continue supporting Sector
       Reforms.

120. Other significant changes to include two Additional Funding: The program did not
change in terms of scope, design, and implementation arrangements and schedule during the
implementation time frame. However, the scale was somewhat increased to include more focus
on programmatic areas for malaria through the first Additional Financing (AF) and support to
the Food Fortification Program and procurement of emergency obstetric equipment through the
second AF. The project had three extensions, one 2007-2009 to ensure the completion of the
HSSP II and to facilitate the implementation of the first AF, the other December 31, 2009 to
December 31, to facilitate the implementation of the second AF and the third from December 31
2010 to June 30 2011 to facilitate the completion of the procurement of emergency obstetric
equipment which would increase the proportion of pregnant women delivering in health facilities
and ensure that the implementation of the HSSP III was initiated.

121. Implementation arrangements and institutional set up to monitor progress of
implementation: As established in the Phase I, in order to avoid parallel systems and foster
national capacity and systems strengthening, the Project was implemented within the existing of
the MOHSW in the Department of Policy and Planning and PMORALG. The programme was
managed and monitored through quarterly Basket Financing Committee meetings which
involved senior management from MOHSW and PMO-RALG, as well as donor representatives
channelling funds through the Health Basket. The responsibility for oversight and coordination
of program implementation rested with the Permanent Secretary MOHSW (PS/MOHSW), in
close collaboration with the Permanent Secretary, Prime Minister‟s Office Regional
Administration and Local Government PS / PMO-RALG). For quality assurance, the CMO
took the responsibility for quantity and quality of the outputs. The Health Sector Reform
Secretariat (HSRS) managed the project and took the roll of a secretariat. It is important to note
here that, there was no programme steering committee which is generic to projects with Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) and separate management teams. The Chief Accountant of the
MOH over saw all accounting and financial management under the project/program and the
Director for Administration and Personnel for reviewing the procurement of goods, works, and
services. Most of the funds went into the pool and a small amount remained outside the pooled
funds such as the National Health Insurance, the central component o f the Community Health
Fund, and malarial control through ITNs and insecticide re-treatment of nets. The management
of the IDA funds outside the pool followed the conventional method through a Special Account.
A Joint Annual health Sector Review (JAHSR) every year, preceded by a technical review,
assessed actual expenditures and achievements over the year against the plans. Reviewed the
MTEF for the coming fiscal year, including financial audit for the previous year and the
procurement audit as of December 3 1 o f previous year. This was consistent over the years and
there were 7 JAHSR over the life span of the programme.

122. Lending agreements and how this was implemented: The lending arrangements were
an Adaptable Programme Lending (APL) loan 40mUSD and a grant 25m USD with subsequent
two Additional Financing which finally led the programme to have financial outlay of USD 165



                                               57
m at the end of the programme. The condition to access the loan should be to exhaust first the
grant, which was done.

123. Adherence to the legal covenants: No disbursements will be made into the pooled funds
account until a MOU has been entered into among the Borrower, the Association and the other
Donors contributing to the Pooled Funds. These conditionalities were fully adhered to as
indicated bellow.

1.     The government organized a joint annual review in March-April and later on in
       September-October of each year to review the progress of implementation as well as a
       plan and budget for the subsequent year.
2.     The government submitted to IDA and other development partners at least 4 weeks
       before each annual joint review: (a) an annual report on implementation progress,
       expenditures, and results of any technical reviews; and (b) a plan of action for subsequent
       year.
3.     On a quarterly basis, the government; (a) submitted to IDA and other development
       partners‟ reports on implementation progress and expenditures, and (b) organize basket
       financing committee meetings.
4.     Annual financial audit reports, carried out by an independent Auditor, submitted to IDA
       and other development partners within six months after each financial year.
5.     Annual external procurement audit reports submitted to IDA and other participating
       Partners after each financial year. In addition to the formal annual audits, ad-hoc
       procurement reviews were conducted by external firms.

124. Overview of implementation of the HSDP II: The implementation progress of the
entire project is described as per component and the expected outputs as per results framework.
Critical issues of success and important challenges are highlighted. Later on the Assessment of
Government and World Bank performance

125. Component 1: Improving District Level Health Services: The implementation of
health services at the district level, a decentralised focal point of implementation of all health
services interventions, is guided by the Comprehensive Council Health Plans (CCHP).. The
CCHP are developed on yearly basis and funded by all sources of funding at the district level
including resources from the prepayments schemes- CHF, user fees and NHIF. Funding includes
Vaccines, Medicines, medical supplies and equipment, reagents, TB DOTs, Family planning
commodities etc. While, the Block grant and health Basket funds is being allocated according to
the Resource allocation formula for the delivery of the health services. The CCHPs are
developed using the CCHP planning and reporting guidelines that are in-line with the National
Health Policy, Health sector Strategic plans, i.e. HSSP II 2003- 2008 and HSSP III 2009-2015,
MMAM, MKUKUTA, National vision 2025, MDGs and National Health Program Strategic
Plans (NTLP, Malaria, HIV and AIDS, MNCH, Human resources for Health, Environmental and
occupational Health and Sanitation including Health care Waste Management, NTDs, Non-
Communicable diseases, etc.) Monitoring of implementation of CCHPs is done through
quarterly and annual performance reports.

126. Component 11: Strengthening the Management of Secondary & Tertiary Hospital
Care Human Resources: All hospitals have established Hospital Management team with led by


                                               58
Hospital Managers. Hospital Management committee has also been formed in every hospital. All
public owned hospital have Hospital Boards. All hospitals have Hospital Strategic and
operational plans. Accountability and transparency checks with timely reporting have been
ensured by establishing hospital financial committees that discuss the management and
utilization of hospital funds. On the service delivery all hospitals are delivering a package of
clinical interventions as defined by national norms and standards. All hospitals have taken
measures to mitigate the burden of on hospital staff of increased work and hazards related to
HIV/AIDS. Provides specific quality services for HIV/AIDS patients that includes prevention,
counseling, testing and support to HIV/AIDS patients through established VCT centers. The
Central Govt has increased support to hospitals by providing bloc grants and health baskets. The
MOHSW conducts training to various hospital cadres. Secondary and tertiary Hospitals
infrastructure rehabilitations and preventive maintenance with local participation is being done
through bloc grants, health basket and user fees.

127.   Component 111:.Strengthening the Central Level Stewardship Role:

a.     At Regional Level, to support quality of services at district level
            RHMT planning guidelines were prepared and are in use.
            In collaboration with the Technical Cooperation of JICA, management capacity of
              RHMT was strengthened through a three years project that ended in March 2011.
              The second phase of the project is expected to start in November 2011.
            (The Government through the MHOSW and PMO-RALG agreed to officially
              include eight Regional Health Management Team core members as part of the
              Regional Secretariat staff. To that effect roles and responsibilities of those teams
              were established and also the organizational functioning structure was set.
            RHMTs now support districts to prepare CCHPs. They conduct supportive
              supervision to follow the implementation. CCHP quarterly reports are assessed by
              RHMTs after which they compile and prepare regional reports.
            RHMTs organize Primary Health Care meetings yearly to allow districts share
              experiences.

b.      To Improve Quality of Health Services Delivery: The following are implementation status
in quality Improvement of health care delivery:

          Revision of the Tanzania Quality Improvement Framework (TQIF) in Health Care to
           cater for Medical/Clinical Audits, Strategies in clinical care of patients and Patients
           Centered care.
          Developed National Supportive Supervision Guidelines for Quality Health care
           Services and Infection Prevention and Control Standards.
          Ministry has adopted Stepwise Certification towards accreditation (SWCA) of health
           care services.
          The Diagnostic Services Section of the Ministry started to implement SWCA with
           technical and financial support from WHO and CDC in 2008.

128. Health financing, budgeting and the equitable allocation of resources:              The
government was the major financier of public health expenditures contributing 64% in 2009/10
with the balance being provided by development partners through basket and non-basket funds.


                                               59
Despite the government remaining the largest source of public spending, external resources
provided by bilateral and multilateral agencies have become significant, accounting for up to
36% of the total expenditures in 2009/10 from 30% in 2005/06. Cost sharing revenues have also
increased reaching well over TZS 7.8 billion or 1% of the public health expenditures in 2009/10.
One would view cost sharing as earmarked government funds to the health sector. The share of
public allocation on health to Total Government Expenditure (TGE), including CFS, oscillated
around 10% between 2006/07 and 2010/11. However the share of public allocation on health to
total government expenditure (excluding CFS) increased from 11.6% in 2006/07 to 12.1% in
2010/11.

129. The health sector basket allocations to LGAs increased from 0.5 USD per capita in 2003
to 0.75 USD per capita in 2005; then USD 1 per capita in 2007; 1.25 USD per capita in 2008 and
in 2010 it is 1.50 USD per capita. In 2011 health basket allocation has reached to 1.8 USD per
capita.

130. Insurance schemes: Government has continued to support the management of these
schemes. NHIF and CHF both receive funding from the ministry‟s budget, to support capacity
building activities especially those with management nature. In 2009 the ministry went a step
further by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with NHIF management to grant them
power to manage CHF for the period of three years to 2012. The aim is to strengthen
management of the Fund. Due to these efforts coverage has increased to in both schemes. It
currently stands at 10.8 percent CHF while NHIF coverage is 7.55 percent of September 2011.
In general access to health Services has been improved by the increase of coverage of
prepayment schemes (NHIF, CHF and TIKA) by 15%.

131. Auditing and Financial Accounting arrangements: The World Bank Project was
designed to have three tiers, one following contribution to Basket Fund Holding Account and
follow exchequer system for budgeting, accounting and reporting and the second one was
separate bank accounts at Standard Chartered Bank (T) Ltd and direct payments by the World
Bank. The Project supported the financing and implementation of the Health Sector
Development Program as informed by the second and third Health Sector Strategic Plans and the
Medium Term Expenditures Frameworks (MTEF) of the MOHSW, PMO RALG and
Comprehensive Council Health Plans of all Councils in the country. For pooled funds, the
Government and the Development Partners who were financing the Heath Sector Development
Program adopted the use of common Government systems including planning and budgeting,
procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing, reporting, monitoring and evaluation. The use
of common arrangements by the Development Partners financing the program aimed at


                                               60
strengthening the Government management systems by enabling the Government ownership of
the program, enhancing internal capacity, sustainability of the program and reducing burden and
transaction costs of multiple procedures. The auditing and financial accounting under the Project
were in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Partners
(Government of Tanzania and Donors) participating in the pooled funding (“basket financing) of
the health sector, the procedures and accounting manual for the basket fund, the Government
financial and auditing regulations and the World Bank disbursement guidelines and procedures.

132. Financial Management: The Project used a USD Holding Account (i.e. the joint account
for basket fund) which is maintained by the Treasury at the Central Bank of Tanzania. The
Development Partners including the International Development Association contributed the
funds through the Holding Account basing on their annual commitments stipulated in each year
Side Agreement, signed between the Government and Development Partners contributing funds
to the basket. For IDA funds outside the basket, the Project used Designated Bank Accounts. The
funds were disbursed from the USD Holding Account to the Exchequer, followed the
Government disbursement mechanisms. AS per the MOU, the Project prepared various financial
and technical reports that were used both internally; to monitor the implementation of the Health
Sector Program, assisting in planning and externally to fulfill statutory audit requirements. Most
of the financial reports were generated through the Integrated Financial Management System
(IFMS).

133. Procurement and Audits: The Audit Sub – Committee chaired by the Government;
review the annual audit reports and provides recommendations to the BFC. The committee also
monitors the follow up action/measures on the auditor‟s recommendations and report to the BFC.
The audit has showed mixed results with yearly improvements. Below is the summary of the
audit opinion for the Basket Fund, LGAs and for the non pooled funds provided by IDA from
year 2003/2004 to 2009/2010? Procurement continued to be managed by the Procurement
Management Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and Medical Stores Department.
IDA continued to conduct prior reviews for larger contracts particularly those using competitive
bidding or international consultant procedures, on behalf of the development partners as per
Memorandum of Understanding which governs pooled fund.

134.   Progress towards Results and Results Framework.

   a) Addressing Human Resource crises: Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has been
      keen in ensuring improvement of the human resource situation described as HRH Crisis
      since 2003 and beyond. Ministry is and will go on addressing the human resource
      problems by involving all stakeholders in the improvement of the HRH situation in the
      country. Various interventions have been applied and a number of achievements have
      been realized with time as follows:
          1) Strengthen Zonal Training Centers and teamwork on continuing education
             including exploring how to increasingly distance learning; Upgrading program
             for Nurses through e- learning has been established. e- Learning will provide
             opportunity for health workers to undertake training on the job to minimize
             further shortage of skilled personnel at work place. Distance learning centers have
             been increased from 8 to 16 and various modules have been developed.



                                               61
                Developed HRM District strengthening package (includes Training, Coaching &
                mentoring guide).
            2) Public-Private Partnerships: Currently up to 20 councils have contracted out to
                private facilities to provide health services mainly focusing on MNCH services.
                PPP fora to facilitate interactions at different levels have been established in some
                regions and councils. The private sector involvement is crucial in the provision of
                health services however, there are challenges which include:
                    a. Uncommon understanding of PPC/PPP among key stakeholders.
                    b. Inadequate institutional capacity to implement PPP/PPC at different levels.
                    c. In adequate resources to implement the PPP/PPC.
   b)   To strengthen monitoring and evaluation: Performance audit including monitoring of
        service delivery outputs at district and referral hospitals.
   c)   Progress towards Service Delivery: Service delivery indicators include outpatient
        attendance, vaccination coverage, access to reproductive health services, and indicators
        measuring HIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy, infectious and non-
        communicable disease performances.
   d)   To strengthen the provision o f logistical support through funding of funding of
        pharmaceuticals and health commodities.
   e)   Food Fortification Program.
   f)   Reproductive Health: Support on Emergency Obstetric equipment.

135. Assessment of Government and banks Performance: The general objective was to
improve the provision of quality health services to the Tanzanians. Since the project was
managed through Sector Wide Approach (SWAP), and indicators to monitor the project as well
as to evaluate it were picked from Health Sector Strategic Plan II.

136.    PDO Indicators

   1. Total Fertility Rate: The TFR lightly declined from 5.6 in 1999 to 5.4 in 2010.
   2. Life Expectancy at Birth: The above figure shows an increase in life expectancy from
      52 in 2002 to 56 in 2008 according to prediction. No prediction for 2010 but it is
      expected that life expectance is likely to have improved due to substantial decline of child
      mortality. Decline of child mortality has direct influence to life expectancy improvement.
      This will be confirmed by 2012 Population Census.
   3. INFANT Mortality rate: As we can see from the figure, there is a decline in Infant
      mortality rate from 99(1999) to 51(2010).
   4. Ratio of the IMR of the poorest quintile to the IMR of the least poor quintile: The
      above figure shows the slightly decline in the Ratio of the IMR of the poorest quintile to
      the IMR of the least poor quintile whereby the IMR declined from 1.29 in 1999 to 1.08 in
      2010.
   5. Under Five Mortality rate (per 1000): The results from TDHS 2009/10 shows
      significant decline of child mortality specifically infant and Under Five Mortality Rate
      from 147/10000 in 1999 to 89/10000 in 2010.
   6. Maternal Mortality Rate (per 100,000: The baseline data from TDHS 2004/05,
      estimated Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) at 578 maternal deaths per 100,000 live
      births. The TDHS results of 2009/10 shows MMR has declined to 454 deaths per 100,000


                                                62
       live births. This is a notable improvement but relatively the maternal deaths are still high
       requiring more effort to attain MDG goal which is 265 per 1000,000 live births.

137.   Intermediate Outcome Indicators:

   1. Family Planning: Modern Contraceptive prevalence rate has increased from 20% in
      2004/05 to 27.4% in 2010
   2. Immunization coverage: continues to be high (Penta valent 3 coverage increased from
      85% in 2009 to 91% in 2010), however there are regional disparities.
   3. Coverage of ITNs Improved: completed under five catch up campaign and universal
      coverage campaign.
   4. HIV/AIDS: A notable decline in HIV prevalence13% in 1980‟s to 5.7% in 2007/08.
   5. Care and Treatment; enrolled 749,302 and 390,320 are on treatment, the target is 440,000
      by 2012. 93% of RCH clinics provide PMTCT services and 92% of HIV +ve pregnant
      women receive ARV‟s for prophylaxis.
   6. TB .treatment success and case finding has been maintained at high levels.
   7. Antenatal care services: only 1/3 of the regions have more than 50% women attending
      ANC <16 weeks; ANC 4+ visits: urban – rural gap widening.
   8. Skilled attendance at birth: majority of regions behind national target (50% of women
      get skilled attendant at birth) Maternal Mortality Ratio observing a slight decline in
      maternal mortality ratio we need to strengthen registration of births and deaths.
   9. Allocation per Capita: There is an increase on total public per capita allocation on
      health from 10.7 per capita in 2006/07 to 18.8 $ per capita to 2010/11.
138. How could the design of the project been changed given the current knowledge: The
design of this project was correct except that the APL was not followed. The WB unfortunately
adhered to the traditional mode of running IDA credits. This project did not have a PIU thus it
needed more flexibility to manage the project within the government structures. This was a
challenge to the project management as required to write multiple reports to meet needs of the
WB and for the health basket partners in the SWAp. The WB was demanding special accounts to
be opened for every Additional financing provided as an extension of the project. This demand
was unnecessary and delayed disbursements of the additional financing part of the project. These
demands were not in line with the reforming dynamics not only of health sector but also the
government as a whole, which needed to decrease transaction costs. The same WB was advising
the government to close accounts to remain only with a few. This again was against the principle
of decentralization by devolution (D by D). The communities cannot be empowered by
centralizing the funds at higher levels. The resources need to be accessed at the site of
implementation. “Putting the financial resources where the mouth is?.

139. Declaration of the Government view on how the project performed during the
lifetime given the available evidence of implementation and results:

   •   The Project development objectives of HSDP11 were mostly achieved.
   •   16 out of 22 agreed indicators for HSDP 11 achieved.
   •   Health System in its wider sense has been strengthened as the project contributed to
       increased integration of activities t service delivery levels, increased human resource base,



                                                63
       strengthened management capacity at different levels of health care through training and
       recruitment and steps to improve Health Information systems initiated.
   •   Health services are now delivered through a decentralized system.
   •   Improved District level health services.
   •   Improved secondary and tertiary health care delivery systems.
   •   Improved health status outcomes.
   •   Improved access, utilization, quality and financing of health services.

140.   Remaining challenges to date include:

   •   Shortage in numbers and skills of health staff particularly at District and lower levels.
   •   Insufficient financial resource given the increasing population and demands.
   •   Slow pace of Hospital Management reforms, the most costly level of service delivery, is
       still suffering from poor quality control, poor quality of services, while districts have
       received extensive training in planning and management.
   •   There is a need to intensify supervision, training and motivation, equity deployment of
       staff, logistics improvement and infrastructure.

141. The implementation of the HSDP11 through its support for SWAp has contributed
immensely to the success attained in the delivery on health services in the country.
Achievements that we have attained as a Government is a result of many players and partners
which we acknowledge. We look forward to further support and collaboration in order to
achieve both national and international targets. Long standing partnership with the health sector
through existing funding mechanisms, need to be maintained.

142.   Lessons learned

   •   The Decentralization by devolution has contributed to increased and improved health
       sector delivery in Tanzania.
   •   The adoption of the SWAp arrangement with joint plans, actions, harmonized rules and
       procedures, have broadened the interactions between the MOHSW, MOF and PMO-
       RALG and the donor community.
   •   Government ownership was critical to successful implementation of the project.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

143. Thank you for sharing this “IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS
REPORT? with us. I enjoyed reading the document, I understand better how the WB operates,
and why certain issues were so important for the Bank, compared to others (never too late to
learn).

144.   I can subscribe to most of the achievements you mention in the report.

   a) Yes the district basket grant has definitely made a serious difference for service delivery
      at district level as well as for the overall management of resources for health (planning,
      implementing and reporting).
   b) The basket has also for sure contributed to the set up and development (with JICA
      technical support) of the regional management teams, which have the important mandate
      of quality insurance. Still a lot remains to be done but the RHMTs exist and consolidate.
   c) But at central level (MoHSW) despite the direct financial support from the PFMRP, and
      the direct technical support by some partners (Danida, GIZ, SDC...) the overall
      management of resources does not show drastic improvement. When I compare with 4
      years ago, I would even say to the contrary. We still have to struggle to get simple
      financial and operational information (and when we get them the quality of the
      information is often questionable), the benchmarks for improved HBF management
      haven‟t been met, and the elusive ASC meetings do not allow real progress in
      transparency and accountability.
   d) It might be worth mentioning in the document (maybe in the context) that there are some
      very positive developments in the area of accountability, but they are to be found outside
      of MoHSW => at National Audit Office level (with the CAG producing financial and
      value for money audits which are increasingly to the point and critical), at CSO level
      (production of documents analyzing budgetary and operational issues which are shared
      with the MPs and the media) as well as at parliament level (with the parliamentary
      committees increasingly active and inquiring). At DP level I‟m not sure that we have
      been consistent enough in our push for improved accountability.
   e) Complexity administrative issues and at lack of capacities at the peripheral hindered
      implementation. The Out Of Pocket appears declining from the NHA of 2008 to be
      published.
