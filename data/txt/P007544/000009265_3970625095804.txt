Project Completion Report
PREFACE
This report represents the completion report for the Baja
California Tourism Project financed in May 1977 under Loan 1420-ME for
US$42 million equivalent. Although disbursements for the project were
completed in May 1982, the physical components were not completed until
April 1983. The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared in February
1985 and is based upon June 1982 data. However, more recent data on the
project were received from the Mexican authorities in 1985 and are
incorporated in this final version of the PCR. The PCR covers the imple-
mentation experience and is partially based on a PCR prepared by the
Borrower.
In accordance with the revised project performance auditing
procedures this PCR was read in the Operations Evaluation Department but
the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft PCR was sent to the
Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

Project Completion Report
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The purpose of the above project was to (i) create a new inte-
grated tourism destination in Baja California for the potential tourism
market for Mexico, (ii) stimulate Mexico's regional economic development,
(iii) create additional employment and generate foreign exchange earnings,
(iv) integrate the environmental considerations, mainly conservation, into
the physical development to obtain a more sustainable investment for economic
development. The overall development objectives will be attained over the
next 6-8 years along with satisfactory foreign exchange earnings (para. 6.01).
2.        The Baja California Project resulted in two contemporary well
desigued tourist resorts, each with a support town and a pilot hotel. The
infrastructure for the two resorts was designed to support a first stage
construction over nine years by private investment of 2,100 hotel-rooms,
4,050 apartels (apartment-hotel) rooms and 960 condominium units in tourist
villas.  For each resort a 250 room medium category pilot hotel was built
along with an international airport, roads, streets, walkways, water and
sewer systems, electric power, telephone and ancillary services. Upgrading
and basic infrastructure was provided for the adjacent support town and its
expansion areas (paras. 3.02-3.09).
3.        The Bank project was completed in September 1982; however, the first
stage construction, including additional investment in tourism and urban
facilities, cannot be said to be complete since only one quarter of the pro-
jected hotel rooms were constructed by the end of 1982. A more meaningful and
comprehensive evaluation can only be carried out at a later date. Nevertheless,
it is possible at this stage to state that the project will over time attain all
its major original objectives. The attractiveness of the project was enhanced
by substantial urban investment in existing towns of San Jose del Cabo and
Loreto which have greatly benefitted the local population (paras. 5.07 and 6.01).



MEXICO - LOAN 1420-ME
BAJA CALIFORNIA TOURISM PROJECT
Project Completion Report
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01      In 1975 the Government of Mexico indicated its interest in the
development of new tourism destinations in Baja California, after
completion of the new resort of Cancun on the Caribbean coast (financed in
part by the Inter-American Development Bank at a total cost of about
US$41.5 million) and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo on the Pacific Coast (financed in
part by Bank Loan 793-ME US$22 million -- total cost US$134 million). It
was felt that the existing tourism areas would satisfy only part of the
potential tourism market for Mexico. Early in 1976 the Government
requested that the Bank consider four sites for development along the East
Coast of Baja California. Subsequently, during a project preparation
mission in 1976, agreement was reached on two main sites --Loreto and San
Jose del Cabo-- 360 km and 200 km north and south of La Paz respectively.
1.02      The tourism project consisted of basic infrastructure required
for development of two new tourist resorts - each with a support town and a
pilot hotel. The infrastructure for the two resorts was designed to
support a first stage construction over nine years, by private investors,
of 2,100 hotel rooms, 4,050 apartel (apartment hotel) rooms and 960
condominium units and tourist villas. For each resort, a 250-room pilot
hotel of medium category was built along with an international airport;
roads, streets, walkways, water and sewage systems, electric power,
telephone and ancillary services. Upgrading and basic infrastructLlre was
provided for the adjacent support town and expansion areas. With the
Government's commitment to conservation of the natural environment,
detailed coastal surveys were undertaken as part of the base line studies,
so that p oject preparation took one year. While the loan effectiveness
was delay"d seven mDnths until June 1978, well drilling and rough grading
had started July 1977 in Loreto. The first pilot hotel in Loreto was
opened for business in November 1980, and the airport runway was cowpleted
in December. The San Jose del Cabo pilot hotel was completed August 1981,
one year behind the SAR schedule. These pilot hotels have set an
attractive and appropriate architectural style for each of the resorts (see
Annex 5, Photographs 1 through 3 and 19 through 24). The Bank project was
completed by September 1982. However, the first stage construction,
including additional investment in tourist and urban facilities, cannot be
said to be complete since only one quarter of the projected hotel rooms
were constructed by the end of 1982. A mDre meaningful comprehensive
evaluation can only be carried out at a later date. Nevertheless, it is
possible at this stage to state that the project will, over time, attain
almost all of its major original objectives. The attractiveness of the
project was enhanced by substantial urban investments in the existing towns
of San Jose del Cabo and Loreto which have greatly benefitted the local
population. This Project Completion Report is based on information



-2-
contained in the SAR 1483-ME, dated April 18, 1977, and the review of Bank
files which included supervision and progress reports of the project. A
supervision mission visited Mexico in January 1983, to obtain additional
information for the report. The report was prepared by Edward Echeverria,
with assistance from Thakour Persaud and Ragnar Overby.
B. Tourism Sector
1.03      Mexico is one of the World's major and most richly endowed
tourism destinations. Its varied attractions include architectural remains
of a series of major civilizations, entertainment ranging from modern to
traditional music and dance, a wealth of contemporary creative arts, an
agreeable climate and natural environment and excellent beaches. There are
an estimated 8,000 hotels ranging in size from hundreds of rooms to small
family-operated guest houses. The total rooms available nationwide was
about 250,000 in 1982. In addition Mexico is one of the most accessible
foreign destination for US and Canadian tourists who, together, accounted
for 90% of foreign visitors over the last decade. The number of foreign
visitors to Mexico increased steadily from 1.4 million in 1965 to over 4.0
million by 1980. Because of the acknowledged importance, the Mexican
Government has received financial and technical assistance from the Bank,
IDB and other private lenders. In 1972, Mexico received a Bank Loan
(793-ME) for US$22 million to help finance tourism infrastructure
development of the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo areas,l/ and in addition to Loan
1420-ME, Baja California Tourism Development Project a third loan was made
by the Bank in 1978 (1524-ME) for US$50 million to help finance lending for
tourism development throughout Mexico.2/ In 1976, there was an IDB loan
for US$47 million to develop Cancun as a tourist destination. Another IDB
loan for US$30 million was made in 1978, to finance lower category hotel
development in Mexico.
1.04      The Mexican peso was devalued in 1976 which led to a significant
expansion in tourism facilities shortly thereafter as hoteliers sought to
take advantage of the resulting increase in the number of tourists visiting  ,
Mexico.  During 1978, the average room occupancy reached an unprecedented
overall annual level of 78% in Mexico City's first class hotels. By 1979
pressures were once again building for another peso devaluation. As the
peso became over valued, other tourist destinations began to increase their
share of the tourist market at Mexico's expense.  Finally, beginning in
1982, the peso was devalued in several stages from a rate of 26 to the US
dollar to approximately 200 at this time. One immediate result of the
devaluation was that foreign exchange earnings from tourism declined
significantly while visitor arLivals held steady at about four million for
1982. However, with world economic conditions improving and visitors now
reacting to the dramatic price reductions in Mexico, officials are once
again planning for substantial increases in tourism facilities. Between
1983 and 1988 officials estimate that about 120,000 new hotels rooms wL-ld

be required to meet the needs of tourists to Mexico.3/ While Mexico City
and Acapulco are still the major destinations, Cancun and Ixtapa/Zihuata-
nejo have become successful "terminal resorts" for foreign and domestic
tourism. Domestic tourism in Mexico is also important. With the increased
affluente of Mexico middle class and the 5-day workweek, this market is
growing rapidly. With the growth in demand, hotel capacity has expanded
rapidly and hotel construction peaked in 1979 with over 8,000 rooms under
construction all over Mexico.
1.05      The major contribution of tourism is to the balance of payments,
the generation of employment and more recently to the dispersal of economic
activities. Between 1970 and 1980 tourism receipts grew from US$415 to
US$1,671 million and the tourism industry provided an estimated 400,000-
600,000 jobs for mostly unskilled and semi-skilled workers in 1980.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Project Preparation
2.01      The invaluable experience gained during project preparation of
Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo and Cancun served to guide FONATUR in several way,
including the initial concepts, preliminary designs and calculation of
realistic cost estimates. FONATUR assigned senior managers and technical
staff from Cancun and Ixtapa to direct and coordinate the project
preparation activities. The Bank preparation mission assisted FONATITR and
its consultants at each location in preparing area analyses and preliminary
land-use plans based on detailed soil/terrain analysis, soils samples,
storm drainage, geology, vegetation and climate. The above data was
factored onto an evaluation matrix to achieve functional Land-Use-Plans
that integrated the tourism and urban activities. In addition, FONATUR
wanted to repeat the success of Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo by upgrading the utility
networks, community facilities and environment of the two service towns --
Loreto and San Jose del Cabo. Hence, early in the process, steps were
taken to distribute project benefits as well as social integration. Draft
legislation to create Federal Land Trusts (FIDEICOMISOS) to undertake the
urban improvements and to operate the utility network for an initial period
was approved.
2.02      Environmental Protection and Resource Conservation.  As part of
the environmental base-line studies, the Mexican Institute of Ocean-
ographics of University of Baja California, undertook a coastal study of
30-35 km at the two locations. Beach stability and wave energy studies
established safe building lines, and turbidity and salinity were part of
the qualitative analysis completed before final land uses were designated.
The Bank provided incentives, guidelines and terms of reference for re-
source conservation studies and coastal managemert with special attention
to (i) the San Jose del Cabo lagoon; (ii) Loreto Oasis Mountain Park;
(iii) Coronado Island and marine park; and (iv) Puerto Escondido. These
studies have now formed the basis for establishing ecological parks around
Loreto and the Lagoon of San Jose del Cabo. Bank project staff encouraged

this and a summary of recent hotel construc-ion activities in Mexico.

the novel policy of realizing environmental protection through self-
interest and private initiatives by:
(a) design with the environment;
(b) managing the environment better for business purposes; and
(c) reuse, rather than flow-through, of human waste.
The measures were adopted by FONATUR to provide added tourist attractions
and longer life to the project, thus contributing more to the economy (see
Annex 3, Environaental Performance, paras. 4.01 & 4.02 and 5.07 to 5.09).
2.03      Apprepriate technologies were applied to energy conservation
using flat plate solar collectors to produce hot water. In the site plans,
buildings were oriented for minimum heat intake with landscaping in the
open interior courts designed to create cool environments aimed at reducing
the desert heat. For the service worker housing, a core unit of one room
plus kitchen and bath was designed to be expanded to the needs of each
family through affordable aided self-help programs.
B. Project Appraisal
2.04      The project was appraised in October 1976 by a mission consisting
of Bank staff -- seven from the Tourism Department, one from Water Supply,
one from Environment and one from Aviation, covering technical, financial,
economic and ecological aspects on the basis of preliminary design and
engineering studies. Environmental (social and health) aspects were
highlighted by the appraisal mission. Factors prone to upset the described
environment were identified including the existing transpenninsula highway
(not financed by the Bank), water resources scarcity, excessive summer heat
and local cyclones. The project at appraisal consisted of the 'ollowing
components:
(i)  infrastructure and oEher facilities for the Loreto Tourism
Area (Part A) and San Jose del Cabo Tourism Area (Part C);
(ii) a medium category 250-room hotel for each tourism zone;
(iii) infrastructure and other facilities for the two existing
towns: Loreto Urban (Part B) and San Jose del Cabo (Part C);
(iv) two interna-ional airport facilities (Parts A and C); and
(v)  investment promotion, community development activities,
conservation studies and programs, and a tourism market and
economic study. The studies were Part D.
The total project cost was estimated at US$84 million and the foreign
exchange component, estimated at US$42 million, was to be financed by the
Bank. FONATUR was entrusted with executing the project.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness
3.01      The loan beceme effective eleven months after loan signing.  The
main delay was caused by slow land acquisition from private owners by the
FIDEICOMISOS in Loreto and San Jose del Cabo. The July 1976 preparation
mission had reviewed w-ith FONATUR and CORETT (Comision para la Regulari-
zaclon de ia Tenencia de la Tierra) the necessary steps in which 10,i75
ha. in and around Loreto and Puerto Escondido were to be purchased
including 20 km of coast line, and 1,879 ha. for San Jose del Cabo. While
all the legal documents were prepared by October 1977, the Government
hesitated eight months before legalizing the two FIDEICOMISOS; however,
they were finally created in June 1978.
B. Project Execution and Natural Disasters
3.02      To achieve the integrated development on schedule, FONATUR ha  co
assume the implementing role as well as coordination and supervision as in
the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo Tourism Project. In July 1977, FONATUR drilled
production wells for the State Water and Sanitation Agency and set the
alignment of the 155 KV power line and sub-station for the Federal
Electricity Commission (CFE) for minimum environmental impact. The same
was done for telephones for TELMEX. The hotel and vocational training
schools for IMSS in the two urban areas were given an early start, grouped
with other community facilities to form functional social centers (see
Annex 5, Photos 14 and 18). The Federal and State operating agencies
provided careful supervision to ensure conformity to their standards. The
construction of the FONATUR staff housing and field offices in Loreto
started in September 1977 (see Annex 5, Photos 10 and 25) and for San Jose
del Cabo in February 1978. Computerized construction schedules were
prepared for all 93 major components with over 1,000 sub-components; weekly
PERT charts were maintained to help resolve coordination problems. FONATUR
appointed Mexican consulting engineers as construction managers to assist
the FONATUR resident coordinating engineers. While this created certain
tensions, they served as an added check on quality and quantity control.
3.03      Natural Disasters.  By June 1979, with half of the physical
components under construction, the Trans-Peninsula Highway, washed out by
heavy rains was closed to heavy trucks for four months and caused a serious
materials shortage. Fortunately, FONATUR was able to import 10,000 tons of
cement which was off-loaded at San Carlos Port on the Pacific Coast
opposite Loreto. Another hurricane hit Loreto in September 1979, with
3,300 mm of rain in 24 hours (a 50-year flood) and tore up the highway once
again. Main drainage channels designed for 2,000 lps were charged with 10
times that volume. Fortunately, the recently built dykes held; otherwise,
the town and airport would have been flooded by 1.5 to 2.0 m of water with
possible heavy loss of lives and property. A similar hurricane hit San
Jose del Cabo a year later (see Annex 3, para. 4.02)
3.04      Cost Increases.  By mid-1980 semi-skilled labor had increased
from M$2,500/week to M$4,400 (US$150). As a result some contract items
increased 236% over SAR estimates. Mechanical and plumbing contracts for
the hotel suffered a 39.5% increase from May 1980 to January 1981, while



-6-
construction equipment increases were between 30 and 78Z. Furthermore, in
1980, the Secretary of Program and Budgets only allocated US$16 million of
the approved US$30 million needed for project wo-zks that year.
C.  Changes in Land-Use Plans
3.05      The March 1980 supervision mission opposed a change in the site
plan for San Jose del Cabo, where the main Boulevard was looped out onto
the beach to create a "window to sea.' The boulevard would have invaded
the 'primary dune" system   and created a conflict between pedestrians and
vehicles. After a thorough review, the Boulevard was brought back to its
original alignment and the primary dune protection was written in strong
set-back lines across all site plans and described in law (see Map 3). A
similar change was proposed for the Loreto Tourism Area to make a large
traffic island to hold the animation center with exhibition hall, theatre,
restaurants, and clubs for day and night activities - requiring direct and
safe pedestrian links to the beach. The original plan was finally adopted
and implemented (see Map 2). A beneficial change was made in the San Jose
del Cabo plan by substituting a 9-hole golf course for d4sert parks and
walkways. The cost of the golf course (not financed by the Bank loan) is
being recovered by increasing the sale price of residential lots on the
fairways from M$250 to M$450 (M$200 above the SAR estimate). The cost of
drainage was reduced and the recycled effluent from the treatment plant
will be used to irrigate fairtvavs and greens (see Map 3 and Annex 3,
para. 3).
D. Social Tourism and Construction Workers Accommodations
3.06      To remedy the severe housing shortage of the construction workers
and engineers, two 120-room pre-fabricated hostels (not part of the
project) were trailed down in sections from San Diego completely furnished
and equipped for Loreto and San Jose del Cabo. Initially, they were
furnished for rent to the construction coLpanies at four persons per ioom
using two double decker bunks. By June 1980 the first hostel, Nuevo Sol,
was built on 2.4 hectares in San Jose del Cabo on the western edge of the
beach adjacent to an existing trailer park. With the reduction in labor
force, the hostel now provides accommodation for social tourism at a third
of the price of regular hotels. A simple cafeteria provides tasty food and
the gardens were attractively landscaped with a small swimming pool,
outdoor bar, grill and changing rooms that are open to the public. The
Loreto hostel, Vina del Mar, was completed in December 1980, on the ejido-
beach adjacent to the town of Loreto and next to the long established
motels for sports fishermen (see Annex 5, Photos 4 and 5). The hostels
were financed by FONATUR and are managed by private entrepreneurs. The
total cost of the San Jose del Cabo hostel was US$969,000 or US$8,075 per
room (US$1,840 per construction worker accommodation). The experience in
Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo provided a good lesson where the construction camps were
torn down and rebuilt four times at a total cost of about US$1,200 per
worker then finally demolished. The cost of refinishing the hostels after
the construction workers left was 'ess than US$200 per room.



-7-
E. Improvements in the Urban Environment
3.07      FONATUR made an early effort with community organizers to improve
the urban environment of San Jose del Cabo. By June 1980 the center of the
31d town was renovated with a new landscaped central plaza including the
forecourt of the old church at the north end of the improved Boulevard
(see Annex 5, Photo 27). The facades of the s!lrrounding buildings were
renovated in traditional colonial style designed by FONATUR architects and
implemented by loans to the owners. All the improvements were completed in
time for the 250-year celebration of the founding of the town.
Furthermore, FONATUR assisted the FIDEICOMISO and the Municipality with
improvements to the slaughterhouse and other municipal service buildings.
The southern end of the Boulevard was realigned to connect with the main
access Boulevard to the tourism zones from the town (see Map no. 3). With
these urban ameneties and improvements, FONATUR gained the support of the
Municipality and residents who feared that their needs would be secondary
to the tourism development. An urban improvement plan was prepared for the
center of Loreto. The main entrance was integrated into a new sub-division
of 5,500 fully serviced lots for the expansion of the town with an
attractively landscaped entrance (see Annex 5, Photo 9). Unfortunately,
progress on the renovation of the old town is slow due to lack of funds;
the main road will be realigned to create a plaza in front of the mission
church - the oldest continual mission in Baja California (see Map no. 2).
By December 1982 civil works (not part of the Project) were virtually
complete on the water supply and 80% complete on the sanitary sewers,
rebuilding the sea wall, storm drainage and Boulevard along the beach.
3.08      Each of the towns was designed for 25,000 population from an
initial size of 3,000 to 4,000. To provide for low-income service workers
in the initial stage, 500 minimum sized serviced lots were distributed in
each town. Construction materials depots were established and affordable
prototype -core units were designed. FONATUR is also providing technical
assistance in the aided self-help program.
F. International Airports
3.09      The two airports were designed with a capacity of 250 peak-
hour passengers by Mexican consulting architects/ergineers and supervised
by SAHOP; the Bank staff of LCPPR supervised the construction as part of
the Bank's lending to the national program of airport improvements. For
the San Jose del Cabo Airport, a new 2,200 m runway, taxiways and apron
were already under construction during appraisal. The project helped
finance the passenger terminal, fire and rescue building, navigation aides,
fuel farm, security and parking. The VOR flight approach alignment was
adjusted during appraisal to avoid the town and the tourism zone. By
October 4, 1982, the airport was fully operational with a well organized
tent-structure passenger terminal. Work on the permanent terminal has been
delayed because of the Presidential order (para. 3.10) b.: is scheduled for
completion by january of 1985. The airport was already included in the
bi-lateral air agreement with the US to permit service from Los Angeles,
Tucson and Phoenix. Loreto's airport was only adequate for light aircrafts
and DC3s. As part of the project the existing runway was expanded to
2,200 m and was provided with taxiway and apron with full services for
commercial jets. The runway, taxiway, apron and fuel services were



-8-
operational by November 1982, and the small attractive existing terminal
will serve passengers t-hrough 1986/87. Construction of the new terminal
with the same capacity as the one for San Jose del Cabo has been delayed
for the same reason, but is scheduled for completion by mid-1985. Loreto
now has scheduled air service on international routes to and from Los
Angeles and Phoenix, and the number of routes will be increased as the
hotel capacity is expanded. The land-use plan of the town was carefully
designed with sports field, playgrounds and other non-residential uses
under the 90 decibel or greater noise cone of the flight pattern (see Map 2
and Annex 3, para. 5.04).
G. Suspension of Works
3.10      On the eve of the completion of the project on April 21, 1982,
FONATUR received a national Presidential Decree published in the -Diario
Oficial to:
(a) 'Suspend indefinitely all works that were not directly
related to income generation; and
(b) Postpone the start of new investment and reduce the rate of
construction wherever possible-.
Excluded from the Decree were the construction and expansion of hotels,
restaurants, centers of camping and recreation; however; all urban
infrastructure and community facilities under construction and the tourism
social centers were suspended by FONATUR, except where the contractor owed
FONATUR from advanced monies. Fortunately, the urbanization works were
finished in both Loreto and San Jose del Cabo by 1982; however, the order
suspended some of the essential community facilities that were at least 75%
completed (including furnishing and equipment) and would have been
completed by the end of June 1982. The mission prepared in collaboration
with FONATUR Technical Department a revised completion schedule and cost
estimates to place each of the facilities in operation by staggered dates
starting September 30, 1982.
H. Costs and Disbursement
3.11      The final cost of the project was US$134.1 million as compared
with the SAR estimate of US$83.4 million, representing a cost overrun of
60.7%. The SAR estimate was based on an exchange rate of Mex$19.9 while
the average ex;change for the sub-projects varied from Mex$47.75 to
Mex$54.07. Cost overruns for the sub-projects varied greatly with the
pilot hotels having increases of 210% (Annex 1, Table I to 4). I)uring the
construction of the hotels, FONATUR and SECTUR decided to build additional
ameneties for social activities such as discotheques, specialty restlurants
and aquatic facilities which added over 50% to the SAR estimate, higher
quality finishes and furnishings added 20%, and inflation, another 30%.
While adding to the visitor's enjoyments, they raised the category to five
star while still catering to a four star market. Bank supervision missions
were unable to convince them of the financial implications. The costs of
the infrastructure arnd tourism community facilities were carefully
monitored and timely progress reports evaluated. As a result, the Loreto
Tourism area cost overrun was 29.4Z and Loreto Urban (the town), overrun



was only 6.5%. For the combined tourism and urban works for San Jose del
Cabo the cost overrun was 27.6%. All the cost overruns for the infra-
structure, etc. - excluding the hotels - were due to price increases
(inflation) of materials and labor (see para. 3.04).  Due to delays in land
acquisition, disbursements were low through CY 1979 and less than 40%
through CY 80 compared to the SAR of 99%. However, by the end of CY 81
they were 93% and fully disbursed by May 1982, after a 15-month extension
of the closing date.
3.12      Procurement.  Procurement was in accordance with the provisions
of the Loan Agreement and Bank Guidelines. The components were sensibly
packaged in bidding documents to allow for economies of scale while at the
same time allowing flexibility so that smaller local firms of Baja
California could participate. The special commission in FONATUR for the
evaluation of all bids promptly submitted all evaluations for Bank review.
By March 1982, FONATUR had executed 185 contracts of construction,
equipment and materials: 56 for the Loreto Tourism Zone, 15 for Loreto
urban and 51 for San Jose del Cabo.  Civil works contracts with values
less than US$500,000 were retained in FONATUR offices and reviewed during
subsequent missions.
I. Quality of Work Completed and Performance of Consultants
3.13      The quality of work completed throughout the project was
excellent. The attractive prototype hotels using local materials have set
the appropriate architectural style for each resort (see Annex 5, Photos 1
through 9 and 19 through 24). Note the flat plate solar collectors in
Photo 22. There were two exceptions to the high quality in San Jose del
Cabo: a section of paving which had to be redone where the sub-soil
conditions proved inadequate and the inadequate foundations for the sewage
treatment plant (see Annex 3, para. 4.02). The success of the operation
was due in large part to the experienced staff appointed by FONATUR to
supervise project execL  on.  Except for limited participation of a US
coastal scientist consultant, all consultants were Mexicans. The land
planning consultants showed sensitivity in delineating functional land-use
plans based on soil/terrain analysis and backed by sound land-use
regulations and controls. The final site development plans were of high
quality and expressed the objectives of the project (except for the
upgrading of the pilot hotels, mentioned in para. 3.11). In collaboration
with operating and regulatory agencies, FONATUR achieved a high degree of
excellence in the architectural and engineering details of the buildings.
All consultants worked effectively in attempting to achieve an optimum
construction program within the financial framework of the project. Only a
few of the features were rejected due to excess cost.
IV. INSTITUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The main Government institutions involved in tourism activities
are the Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR), a special trust, Foado Nacional de
Fomento al Turismo (FONATUR), and an advisory council, Consejo Nacional de
Turismo. There is also Nacional Hotelera, a hotel management group which
functions independently but is under the organizational structure of
FONATUR.   FONATUR was established as a trust fund of the Federal
Government under the administrative supervision of Nacional Financiera, SA,



-10-
(NAFINSA), a major public sector development financing institution.
FONATUR's operating regulations permit its involvement in a wide range of
activities throughout Mexico. However, among its primary responsibilities
are: (a) rediscounting of up to 902 of loans made for tourism related
activities by intermediate institutions, (b) direct equity investment or
lending in tourism, especially with respect to infrastructure work and
initial investments aimed at opening up new tourist destinations, (c)
technical assistance to intermediate institutions and borrowers, and (d)
economic studies involving market analysis. This last item was financed in
Part *D" of the Bank loan (see Annex 4, Economic and Marke'.^ng Studies).
A. Performance of FONATUR
4.02      During the project implementation, FONATUR's administration
changed with changes in Government; in fact, the Director General of
FONATUR was changed three times along with the sub-gerentes. Nevertheless,
continuity was maintained with smooth transition, mainly because key
project personnel were retained. Over the years, FONATUR has maintained
its effectiveness to plan, coordinate and implement major tourism projects
throughout the country. In turn, this made the coordination much more
effective with other agencies under the project such as CFE (power), TELMEX
(telecommunication), the SAHOP and SCT (airports), and SARH (water
resources). When the Bank expressed concern with the lack of progress on
the sites and services component, FONATUR on the following mission convened
a seminar/workshop in Lazaro Cardenas to evaluate the Bank urban upgrading
project. The results were applied to similar programs for Loreto and San
Jose del Cabo. During the PCR mission, FONATUR and all the operating
agencies cooperated in providing information to prepare the necessary
documentation.
B. Bank Group Performance
4.03      The Bank group responded to the request for assistance in 1975,
and within three months an identification mission was sent, followed by
appraisal in October 1976. A Bank water supply engineer appraised the
water and sanitary sewer components and a PAS environmentalist appraised
the conservation and environmental management programs. The first four
missions consisted of 50-60% technical assistance on the revisions to the
land-use, site development and architectural plans. Technical suggestions
on design and engineering by the mission were quickly adopted in the field
in a spirit of cooperation and with open communications (see change in
Land-Use Plans, para. 3.05). The intensive supervision during the first
year of implementation provided a sound basis for making mid-course
adjustments in phasing to accommodate for the delays in the opening of the
hotels.
V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Financial Aspects - Hotels, Airports and Water Supply
5.01      During the PCR mission in January, 1983, work was still being
done on the airport terminals (para. 3.09) and the commercial/community
centers. The incompleteness of such physical components, the devaluation



-11-
of the Mexican peso and its impact upon tourism flows make it difficult to
evaluate financial performance with those projected during appraisal.
5.02      For the financial and economic analyses, the cost figures are
actual costs combined with estimates made to complete the few remaining
c. nponents. Since most of the operations have recently begun, the income
and revenue projections are based on current conditions as well as future
expectations. The base year for the economic analyses is 1983 and all
figures are adjusted to December, 1983, prices. Apart from the two
distinct geographical locations of sub-projects in Loreto and San Jose del
Cabo, each site has several components spread out in the tourism zones and
adjacent urban areas. Consequently, the task of an economic and financial
evaluation of the components becomes more complex. The tables in Annex 2
present details of costs of the various components along with the benefit
streams. These figures are in both current and constant prices for the
infrastructure works, hotels, airports, and the water and related
facilities.
5.03      Hotels.  Annex 2, Tables 6 and 7 summarize projected operations
of FONATUR's hotels in Loreto and San Jose del Cabo. These tables are
based upon actual figures and projections derived from studies made by
FONATUR for the areas. As they indicate, the hotels are expected to
operate at a loss up to 1992 if capital expenses are considered. During
appraisal, it was expected that losses would extend only up to 1982;
however, as explained in para. 3.11 FONATUR added amenities for increase
visitor enjoyment. They now must increase tariffs commensurately. It was
also projected that occupancy rates would be higher, starting out at 50%
and rising to 70%. In current projections, occupancy rates begin at 18.4Z
for Loreto and reach a maximum of 58.4% by 1990 and 26.8% and 68.8%
respectively for San Jose del Cabo. The low rates for Loreto are due to a
lag in the tourist market for the new destination; however, promotion
efforts during 1983 and 1984 have increased occupancy rates (see Annex 4,
para. 3). The current readjustment period for tourism in Mexico makes it
rather difficult to estimate profitability prospects of these and other new
hotels in the area. However, indications are that at least over the next
decade, Mexico will continue to maintain its price advantage over other
competing destinations. With many North Americans tour operators now
offering packages to Baja California in direct flights, it is expected that
the actual situation would be much better than current projections.
5.04      Airports.  Annex 2, Tables 3 and 4 summarize the cost and benefit
position of the airports in Loreto and San Jose del Cabo respectively. The
operation and income figures are projections made by the airport service
department 4/ based upon: (a) their experience in operating similar
facilities throughout Mexico, and (b) projected traffic estimates. Both of
the airports have suffered serious delays and cost overrun which have
caused wide differences between SAR estimates and current projections.
Additionally, lower frequency of airline flights have also contributed to
the poor financial position of the subproject. The SAR estimated total
annual revenue at full development of about US$3.7 million and US$2.2
million for Loreto and San Jose del Cabo respectively. Current projections
are for receipts of only US$1.7 million and US$2.2 million for Loreto and
4/ Detail of these projections and assumptions are in the project file.



-12-
San Jose del Cabo respectively. While in the SAR, there is a projected
positive earning situation after five years of operation, under current
projections there is expected to be steadily increasing losses. Projected
operating income (including the departure tax) is not expected to be
sufficient to meet the burden of administrative, operating and maintenance
costs. This indicates the need for either a review of the various
operating aDd maintenance cost categories or the tariff structure, or both.
5.05      Water Supply.  Annex 2, Table 5, contains details of the cost and
benefit streams associated with the water operation of Loreto. FONATUR had
planned at appraisal to have a new system established in San Jose del Cabo
also. However, after initial analyses, the water sources and existing
distribution network was considered adequate with a few minor investments.
New trunk mains and distribution network was added to serve the tourism
zone. During appraisal, it was assumed that both the Loreto and San Jose
del Cabo water and sewage works would be operated as independent units
managed by local municipal commissions (FIDEICONISOS). This has not yet
occurred, and it appears as the present system will continue to be
administered by the Direccion de Aguas y Saneamiento of the State of Baja
California. The existing water systems are weak financially and are
seriously under staffed and ill-prepared to handle present operations. All
of their revenues are funnelled to the state capital. Periodically the
State Government transfers a portion back to the operating agencies. A
recent law affecting water and other municipal entities is expected to
gradually strengthen their financial resources.
5.06      Reliable figures on the operations of the water agencies are
difficult to obcain. Estimates of current water losses and unaccounted
volume range from 40 to 65% of production volume. However, this does not
appear in Annex 2, Table 5. Because of the present situation described
above, FONATUR regards the figures in Table 5 as more of a projection on
future operations rather than a presentation of current figures.   These
projections can be achieved if the state and local authorities take
appropriate actions to comply with the original agreement to create
independent water authorities. If this is done, the new z&tered house
connections and services would be combined with efficiency neasures aimed
at reducing unaccounted water, thereby recovering cost for operation,
maintenance and expansion of the system.
B. Economic Re-Evaluation
5.07      Tables 1 and 6 of Annex 2 present details of the project costs
by year. The reestimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the
entire project is 14%. The IERR for Loreto is estimated to be 17% while
for San Jose del Cabo (SJC), it is 8%. In the SAR, it was estimated that
these figures would be 17 and 19%, respectively for Loreto and SJC. Given
the extent and intensity of the impact of such adverse factors as
devaluation, decline in international tourism flows and delays in project
implementation, the original estimate is not comparable with present
estimates. The following summarizes the present and original estimates of
the IERR.

5.08      The infrastructure  cost overrun for this project is estimated to
be about 24%. However, in terms of its distribution between Loreto and
SJC, the latter has experienced about twice the cost overrun of the former
(see para. 3.11). Consequently, in the appraisal sensitivity analysis,
there is some comparability with the case of investment costs rising by 20%
for Loreto. For SJC, the higher cost overrun does not allow for similar
comparisons. Additionally, the factors of project implementation delays
and world economic conditions have also had a negative impact upon the
project.5/
C. Other Benefits
5.09      In terms of employment benefits of the project, it is estimated
that the construction work has created about 1,600 new jobs. Employment in
the hotels and ancillary activities is currently estimated to be about
1,600 with approximately 7,200 at full development. These two new sites
have also created a new pole for regional economic development in the
peninsula, and they contribute to the diversity of Mexico's touristic
assets. Since this exercise is occurring so early after project
completion, there are several readjustment factors currently affecting
Mexico's tourisw industry.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The integrated development of the two resort towns is being
achieved along with the social, economic and institutional development
objectives for the sourthern part of Baja California Peninsula. Reports
from tourists visits to both resorts are most favourable. The overall
development objectives will be attained over the next 6 to 8 years. :he
reestimated internal economic rates of return for the entire project is
14%. With the diverse locations of sub-projects 560 km apart, there was a
5/ In may 1985 FONATUR prepared a revised cash-flow and internal rate of
return based on additional revenues from the sale of the undeveloped
adjacent lands in the three sites of the project (see Annex 7).

risk of uneven hotel development because of the larger established tourist
market in San Jose del Cabo. As a consequence, San Jose del Cabo today
offers four hotels, the best being the FONATUR pilot hotel in terms of
quality of environment and recreation facilities, while the single hotel in
Loreto of equal quality offers a greater variety of nature preserves and
conservancy. All indicators of land sales and incentives to build hotels
show that the development objectives are being achieved. The increase in
tourism traffic has been due to the construction of an international
airport at each location and improving overnight ferry service from four
ports of the mainland to San Jose del Cabo, La Paz, and Santa Rosalina
(North of Loreto). From the experience of this project and the earlier
Ixtapa--Zihuatanejo Project, it is worth emphasizing:
(a) land acquisition and land related issues should be
substantially completed by the time the project is
presented to the Board;
(b)  financing of the first hotel resulted in an attractive
resort using local materials, set the architectural style
for the resort, but the design of additional hotels must be
scrutinized to maintain a harmony of architectural form and
style;
(c) environmental controls are essential to create and maintain
a new tourism destination starting with the environmental
base line, diagnostic surveys, land-use regulations, natural
resources, waste management, urban form and architectural
style, landscaping;
(d) community development effort should be initiated very early
in the project cycle so that the project implementation
receives full support from the inhabitants thereby
minimizing the social costs and stresses; and
(e) implementing agencies should be vested with strong
coordinating powers and fully staffed in order that they can
effectively coordinate the activities of the various
institutions involved and thus prevent delays.

MEXICO

Baja California Tourism Project
Environmental Performance
1. Summary:
Integration of environmental considerations, mainly conservation,
has made the project a more sustainable investment for economic
development. Difficulties including calamitous cyclones have been
encountered, but the overall successful enhancement of project
environmental and economic benefits are significant. This has been made
possible by a combination of Bank initiative and a desire for environmental
protection of the investment on the part of the borrower. Through
cooperation, project environmental diseconomies (caused by waste) have been
ameliorated and positive externalities realized (conservation). In part,
this reflects prior learning experiences elsewhere in Mexico by both
FONATUR and the Bank. Within the tourism sector, it is generally
recognized that investments contain seeds to their own destruction
environmentally and, accordingly, the sector is one where environmental
aspects historically have found acceptance earlier than in most other
development sectors. The more outstanding features, accomplishments,
findings, recommendations, considerations and future requirements agreed on
will be highlighted below.
2.        The interest and importance apportioned to environmental
protection by the Mexican Government was highlighted by the appraisal
report and a list of established national ,-rks (eleven) included. Among
them was the project-related, unique, and potentially most valuable lagoon
within the San Jose del Cabo project site. Also included was the analogous
environmental project asset ("The Oasis") at Loreto. Agreements made and
assurances received :-r'uded:
(i)   project design measures to preserve the natural environment;
(ii) minimam disturbance to existing vegetation and green zones;
(iii) planting of natural ground cover where needed;
(iv) disallowing construction on primary and secondary dunes; and
(v)   water management studies.
Budgetary allocations toward realization of these environmental
considerations were included in Annex 1 of the SAR. Most importantly to
the human environment and from a public health point of view was the
inclusion of adequate finance for water supply and sanitation.

3.        By the fall of 1980 significant progress had beer made in
environmental studies, consultants finalized the "Estudio de Rehabilitacion
del Estero en San Jose del Cabo B.C.S." (Vol. 1 and 2). A detailed
analysis of the report was made by the Bank and views on progress were
shared with spe_ial emphasis on:
(i)   optimization of benefits from the Oasis (mountain
park-potential);
(ii)  Coronado island eco-system conservation;
(iii) beach conservation;
(iv)  water quality; and
(v)   project environmental resources management issues in general.
The project was still far from implemented in the fall of 1980 and major
important observations and contributions were made:
I.    FONATUR was as dedicated to environmental soundness as at the
time of appraisal;
II.   All construction works under way were mindful of beach
conservation regulations.  A road violation (of Section 3.07,
Loan Agreement D) to provide a "look-out" over the beach was an
exception firmly and promptly corrected by the project officer.
III.  And, the Bank expanded its suggested recommendations for
management of;
(a) the Oasis (Primera Agua);
(b) the Coronado Island; and
(c) the 'Estero en San Jose del Cabo".
The policy behind these recommendations was to accomplish conservation via
optimization of positive feedbacks from properly managed environmental
assets to the project-1/ A one-man supervision mission in December of
1980 found the new sanitary sewage treatment systems, for the two tourism
areas and respective towns, about to close the ecological cycle by
recharging of the aquife7 with the treated effluent for irrigation. The
Ministry of Interior was utilizing the guidelines agreed to earlier in
establishing a nature conservancy at the Isla Coronado with controlled
access for tourists and local fishermen. The Oasis had received general
upgrading after hurricane damage in 1979 and was open for visitor
enjoyment. General and acceptable environmental progress was found at both
project area locations. The mission impressed upon FONATUR the need to
form these various eco-systems in a functional coastal zone management
program.
1/ This approach is chosen by the Bank. It represents an uncommom approach
to environmental protection.

4. Froject Completion at San Jose del Cabo; Environmental Findings
(a)   The Lagoon:
4.01      The beautifully designed hotel El Presidente at San Jose del Cabo
bends unobstrusively with its surroundings, safely set-back from the beach,
and close enough to the lagoon to take full advantage of its beatuty and
rich birdlife (over 40 species by random observation of Bank environmental
staff member; over 120 according to rumors). From the outset, it was
agreed to encourage regulated lagoon usage by the tourists as an added
attraction to the place. FONATUR built with counterpart funds a boat-house
with safe ramps and easy access from the hotel to paddle boats and canoes
(motorized boats are disallowed). Since the lagoon is a very unique asset
which can best be managed as such, rather than as a set-aside, nature
conservancy, it will effect positively hotel occupancy rates in the
future. It is not, however, an entirely easy body of water to manage;
because very low rainfall is the rule in this desert-region, no
volume-management is generally required. When it does rain, it tends to be
very heavy, and the natural barrier to the ocean breaks. The lagoon
empties and its trunk-littered, muddy bottom becomes an ugly site. In
part, the extensive drainage is due to shallowness caused by slow natural
sediment built-up over time, and in part by fast, intermittent, build-up
due to watershed erosion. To solve this problem, the Bank naturally
suggested dredging, as required, combined with velocity check dams
upstream, and FONATUR agreed to do so. Issues related to water quality,
however, required different solutions and, to protect the lagoon from
sanitary waste, a secondary sewage treatment plant was built. Whenever
possible (to save pumping expenses), such plants are placed low, and thus
often in or near floodplains.
4.02      In September of 1982, the project was visited by a severe
Chubasco- rainstorm which caused enough river-bank erosion to undermine
the treatment plant foundations. Part of the plant collapsed (clarifier,
activated sludge units, etc.) and virtually untreated waste-waters entered
the lagoon. The severity of the storm, the rarity with which such storms
occur, and the non-existence of meteorological data for planning purposes
are understandable, but invalid excuses. The treatment plant was built on
sand, in the flood plain, and without deep footings and foundations, even
though only a few hundred meters downstream a house, still visible,
collapsed some years ago because of its proximity to the river-bank. It
too was undermined by erosion and, it is note-worthy that the incident is a
live record ignored by the planners and builders of the activated sewage
treatment plant. Several other issues incidental to the plant and its
operations were discussed at length with FONATUR:
(i)   the chlorination unit which did not function;
(ii)  the complete lack of plant operational data;2/ and
(iii) the problem of what to do with continuing pollution of the lagoon
from waste water passing through the plant into the western
lagoon branch recipient.

ANNEX 3
Page 4
FONATUR fully understood and appreciated the nature and severity of the
above issues, and its new manager assured the mission that he would resolve
the problems satisfactorily. He would also include monitoring and
readiness to act should problems of knats, flies, and mosquitoes worsen.
The connections between experienced nuisance episodes and the unfortunate
sewage wasteload upon the lagoon is uncertain; but FONATUR continues to
monitor the situation. By June 1983 a portion of the plants was salvaged
and new clarifiers and activated sludge units have been constructed.  The
treated effluent will soon be pumped up to the golf course ponds in the
center of the tourist zone. An overall assessment of the lagoon and its
environs demonstrated that the undisturbed natural indigenous vegetation
experienced no significant problems from the latest storms; eco-system
adaptations are perfect. This fact was often stressed at appraisal, along
with concurrent recommendations to always, when possible, retain the
original vegetation cover.
(b)   The Beach:
4.03      At San Jose del Cabo the beautiful beach is facing the open sea
and receiving a restless beating. It is, therefore, a vulnerable ecotone,
liable to react excessively to disturbances and in need of constant
protection against abuse. On the basis of the Bank's suggestions hotels
were built further back from the beach. This is the most important
precaution and investment protection against the elements. FONATUR was
urged, and agreed, to monitor beach activities and dunes behavior; to
prohibit driving on the dunes; keep them clean; and discourage excessive
activities (horse-riding, games, etc.) along the shorefront. Wind erosion
can become a problem and may combine with wave-energies to cause
significant environmental changes damaging to adjacent hotel facilities by
the beaches.
Cc)   Energy:
4.04      FONATUR has taken advantage of abundant free-flowing solar
energies and installed solar-panels in accordance with enlightened advise
from the Bank. They were sadly given an unpredictable beating by the
latest storm in the area, but are now functioning. Additional sea-ward
wind protection may lessen any future storm impacts. FONATUR also
recognizes the value of trees as environmental protectors ("air
conditioners") against the sun and have planted generously in and around
hotel areas.
4.05      In terms of environmentally sound energy conservations, the
design of hotel El Presidente is outstanding. Air moves freely throughout
the hotel because of excellent design. It, in fact, encourages natural
drafts throughout the hotel. Accumulative energy savings (from
air-conditioning saved) will, over time, be very large. Combined with
plantings, inside and outside, and height-limitations on buildings,
the El Presidente is an example of excellent design.

ANNEX 3
Page 5
(d)   Urban:
4.06      FONATUR and the Bank have agreed since conceptiod of this
development to integrate the tourist zone with the town of San Jose del
Cabo. From a human environmental point of view this is most desirable and
reflective of enlightened economic development. Due to delays in
construction integration is naturally not completen and, the record of
success too embryonic to assess.
(e)   Drainage:
4.07      FONATUR has installed large drainage canals which effectively
channel storm water runoffs from the town-side of the watershed to the
lagoon. The latest storm, however, overwhelmed the system with deposited
sand and gravel carried primarily from areas disturbed by required
earthworks for the new residential areas and infrastructure (mainly
roads). In the period between disturbance and stabilization, the soil is
critically vulnerable to erosion by even normal rains. The heavy rains
from the latest storm caused multiple gullies detrimental to roadways and
side cuts already in place. Much of the silt thus carried in suspension
was later deposited in the canals, properly designed to carry water.
Looking at the undisturbed parts of the surroundings still covered by the
natural vegetation and/or well--established plantings, the importance of
soil cover was again most evident. In general, neither the Bank, nor
FONATUR can be faulted since stabilization necessarily requires much time
in desert regions and the storm was unpredictable. An exception may be the
virtual absence of culverts because of the savings resulting therefrom,
although on closer scrutir.y one could argue the economics of risk
protection from the uncertain future damage of possible heavy rainstorms in
this very arid region.
Ef)   Project Environmental Guardian (PEG):
4.08      The concept of a PEG and the possible creation of a full-time
position was discussed with FONATUR's new management at SJC and found of
sufficient interest to contemplate formulation of its TOR. The project has
a very high number, of associated environmental aspects that are of
sufficient importance to its future financial -health- to warrant the
engagement of a PEG.
5. Project Completion at Loreto
Environmental Findings
(a)   The "Oasis"
5.01      The  Oasis" at Loreto, within easy access for the tourist, have
received significant management by FONATUR as recommended by the Bank. It
has become a very attractive environmental investment asset which in the
future, when occupancy rates are higher, will be visited daily by the
tourists. Currently, its major contribution stems from its function as a
plant nursery. Not only the hotels, but the entire newly developed
residential areas need vegetation badly in order to shade the sun and



-39-                            ANNEX 3
Page 6
protect the soil.  Strictly from an environmental point of view, it is
again worth noticing that conservation of the -Oasis" is being accomplished
via stimulations of its productive potential, not through environmental
legislation.
(b)   The Beach:
5.02      At Loreto and its vicinity, the beaches are often of low quality
naturally and they are not among the tourist attractions. For the beach in
front of the Hotel El Presidente white sand was trucked in to beautify the
immediate environs. A badly designed docking facility, however, is setting
up erosive wave-energies detrimental to the foreshore. It was neither
financed, nor recommended by the Bank.
(c)   Energy:
5.03      In Loreto, energy considerations and actions taken and planned by
FONATUR are similar to those described for SJC. Again, the hotel is
superbly designed (and blends masterfully with its surroundings). So also
does the hotel-related, (energy efficient and effective) sewage lagoons
located at a safe distance; the recycle waste waters will irrigate by
gravite the arid region, as appropriate. Shade-trees have been generously
provided within the hotel zone.
(d)   Urban:
5.04      As in SJC, integration of town and tourism (social tourism) was
planned, but has not yet truly begun. The newly developed urban areas have
few trees and people, while the tnwn improvements will be undertaken in
late 1983 and 1984. Its water-supply is in need of improvement (for better
water quality and less losses) but, also for this town, an activated sewage
treatment plant has been designed with an inadequate laboratory, but with
chlorinators although disinfection of the town water supply is no
affordable. The project manager, was very much aware of these matters and
intent on finding solutions. He was also agreed that the above-ground
power lines severely blocked the mountain view (one of the areas most
outstanding aesthetic attractions), but he was pleased about airplane
noise. Noise levels were made an issue by the Bank in 1976, but judged to
be a non-problem because of the distance to the (Bank-financed) airport.
The actual noise level now was found by the PCR mission to be easily
tolerable.
(e)   Drainage:
5.05      In accordance with recommendations by the Bank, appropriate
drainage designs have been completed and even severe future storms will not
cause problems induced within project expropriated boundaries. FONATUR
will also make sure that the flood plain remains uninhabited.
(f)   Puerto Escondido:
5.06      At and around this beautiful area, an ecological protection zone
has been created. The tourism facilities nearby are also first-rate
environmentally.

ANNEX 3

Economic Conservation and the Coronado Island
5.07      The conservation policy described earlier, and applied elsewhere
under the project, has been recommended by the Bank since 1976 for the
protection of Coronado Island. But FONATUR has not yet taken steps towards
implementation. For the most part, it is not the Island and its few
attractive beaches that are visited, but the rich fishing grounds around
it, especially on the side where the seals are, for the same reason.
Tourists may rent boats ($70 US/day) to get out to this area and these
daily excursions bring over $50,000 of foreign exchange from boat rental
alone. The boats may be a nuisance to the seals, but hardly a threat. At
least not at the current level of activities.
5.08      Such, however, is not the case for commercial fishing.
Shrimpers, seiners, and gill-netters are combing and catching
undiscriminately, reducing potential sports-fishing and, eventually, their
own source of sustainance. Significant catch reductions over the last ten
years have become manifest and these commercial fisheries are definitely
not sustainable. Also, most area commercial fishing is conducted by
mainland fishermen crossing the Sea of Cortez. The situation is
detrimental to the continued existence of one of the main tourist drawing
cards of the project - the sports-fishing opportunities offered by "The
Coronado yellow Tail Parkway'.
5.09      A large enough area (see details on map, Fig. I) should be
declared a National Marine Park, and all commercial fishing within it made
illegal. The first step recommended by the Bank mission was for the
project manager at Loreto to execute an economic conservation study of this
possibility. It is highly probable that the only lasting solution to the
Coronado conservation challenge lies in economic incentives derived from
and created by Project self-interests. Sports-fishing tourists from the
U.S. are the dominant future hotel occupancy clientel, provided fishing
remains good. Sports-fishing poses no danger of depletion. FONATUR is
fully aware that it has good reasons to press for area environmental
protection and resources conservation.
Conclusions
5.10      The environmental impact on the project has thus been much larger
than the project's impact on the environment. The latter has been mostly
positive, and is expected to become even more so as project implementation
proceeds. In the future, when the project is fully developed, it should be
visited again for a more complete environmental completion report.

BAJA CALIFORNiA TOURISM PROJECT
Part D: Market and Economic Studies Component
1.        This loan included US$500,000 to finance studies on the market
and tourism economy of Mexico. US$198,000 were used for the conservation
studies with the remaining US$302,000 earmarked for the market and economic
studies.
2.        Because the market and economic studies were national in scope,
it was decided that the tourism ministry would supervise it and so
responsibility was transferred from FONATUR to SECTUR.
3.        The Bank approved the terms of reference for the market studies
in 1977 and the work was contracted at a cost of US$155,000. The basic
focus was upon the US and Canadian markets and a seccad phase involved
domestic tourism. The report of the consultant for the market studies was
reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory although there were
several questions regarding interpretation and follow-up actions. The
results of the foreign marxet studies have served as a guide for promoting
four specific groups: (i) nature seekers; (ii) cultural explorers; (iii)
family vacationers; and (iv) sport fishing. FONATUR is very satisfied with
the increased tourism generated directly from the promotion campaign, and
the findings continue to guide operational level policies. For example,
increased promotional efforts of the Loreto Market during 1983 and 1984
have been positive - doubling the occupancy. During the high season, the
hotel was completely full.
4.        In October, 1978, another firm was contracted to undertake the
economic studies. SECTUR realized that the remaining loan amount of
US$147,000 would not be enough to finance the economic studies and so the
Fondo Nacional de Estudios (FONEP) was asked to help finance the difference
which was estimated to be about US$450,000. The firm started work without
signing a contract with SECTUR, but received a US$100,000 advance from
SECTUR. By mid-1979 it had spent about US$160,000 and a dispute arose on
the question of the tax liability. The firm claimed that it quoted a price
net of taxes but the government refused to allow a tax exemption. The firm
had already completed the first phase of its work which involved analysing
sample studies in various areas and deriving elasticity coefficients for
tourist groups, locations, incentives, etc. In the resulting dispute, the
firm withdrew its services and was finally paid after it delivered the
results of the first phase of the study. SECTUR thereupon decided to hire
other consultants to complete the work. However, during this period
several changes occurred at all levels of the institution and other
priorities arose. Consequently, no further actions were taken.
5.        Benefits from the economic study have not been significant due to
the incompleteness of the work done and lack of follow-up in such work.
Discussions were held with the vice-minister of tourism who expressed
interest in undertaking an in-depth review this and other studies done in
the sector with a view to assess their usefulness and possible applications
to resolve current problems.

BAJA CALIFORNIA TOURISM PROJECT
FINANCIAL REEVALUATION BY FONATUR
1.        In response to the projected sales and revenues through the year
2002 (made jointly by the PCR Mission and FONATUR), FONATUR recently
revised the financial projections of the Baja California Tourism Project to
capture additional benefits from the adjacent lands not urbanized by the
project but benefitting from the investment in infrastructure. The PCR
mission considered the adjacent land as a resource to be developed by
FONATUR in the future; however, the following reevaluation by FONATUR is
heing included in the PCR as a viable alternative to the phasing of
FONATUR's investments in the infrastructure. The additional lands (90.25
ha) owned by FONATUR will be sold over time through the year 1990 at half
of the value of the project urbarized land. The land developers would
extend the streets and utility networks and construct additional tourism
accommodations phased over time and in conformance with the strict land-use
and environmental controls of FONATUR. Since the tariff issues involving
the operations of water and sewer systems as well as the airports are
political, but will eventually be resolved, to show a satisfactory rate of
return, the following analysis has been undertaken excluding the above
systems. FONATUR will provide an update on the operations of these systems
as soon as the tariff issues are resolved along with the revised cash-flow
and benefit/cost analysis.
2.        Main considerations in the cash flow for the financial
reevaluation proposed by FONATUR
(i) FONATUR's investments in infrastructure and tourism facilities
for this analysis have been considered only through the year
1982, when all the works corresponding to the first stage were
substantially completed. (In the PCR, a rational investment in
infrastructure expansion was projected thru the year 1999 - see
Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2);
(ii) The recovery of these investments from the sale of land is
projected through the year 1996-1997 the date when the inventory
of land and improvements will be fully utilized;
(iii)  Excluded from the cash flow are the water and sanitary sewer
systems as well as the airports whose operations at the present
time have a negative cash flow. FONATUR is currently reviewing
the tariff structures with the respective government agencies to
define the measures required to improve the financial performance
of these entities. FONATUR proposes to analyze the investment in
the water and sanitary sewer systems through 1982 and to project
the cost recovery of these 'nvestments from the sale of water
over time until the capacity gf the system is fully utilized.

3.        From the above diagnosis and analysis the internal rate of return
varies between 8.6% and 9.3% (see Annex 7, Table 1).
Description of the saleable land areas, sales price and the rate of sales
4.        The increases in the saleable land areas for Nopolo, Loreto and
San Jose del Cabo, have been achieved by adding the lot areas adjacent to
the urbanized lots as additional land that received indirect benefits from
the infrastructure and building investments to date. All of the additional
lands can be easily urbanized by private investors without additional cost
to the Project. FONATUR has set the sales value of these lands at half the
sale price of their urbanized lots with the following results:
Nopolo Beach: The areas available for hotel use are 62.27 has.
(originally 77.1 has.) and for villas and condominiums -86.5
has. (originally 65.5 has.). For resort residential lots in
Superblocks III, 1.133 has. has been added and to Superblock V,
2.008 has. to make a total of 25.5 has. of saleable land. The
commercial area is now 9.9 has. (originally 8.3 has.). In the
adjacent land to the residential urbanized land, 16.52 has. have
been added of which 1.52 has. are in Superblock III and 15 has.
in Puerto Escondido.
Loreto Urban Area: In the residential area contained in the
Paseo Julian de Mayorga, 1.198 has. are added for a total of
28.058 has.; for the sites and services 9.65 has.; commercial
area 3.395 has. and industrial area 9.005 has. In the adjacent
lots to the urbanized area, an additional 22.5 has has been
assigned composed of .8 has. of interior lots behind Avenida
Julian de Mayorga and 21.7 has. located behind the Paseo Juan
Manuel Pasaldua.
San Jose del Cabo: In this development, the area allocated to
hotels was 46.57 has., for villas and condominiums 1.6 has. and
resort residential lots along the golf course fairway, 60.206
has. In the urban lots (non-tourist) 63.84 has., commercial area
9.005 has., and industrial 14.937 has. have been allocated. For
the adjacent lands, 51.5 has. has been added in sections A, C and
D of the Residential Area Cerro del Vigia.
6.        The data presented in the attached cash-flow tables - is based on
unit sales prices established by the sales management of FONATUR. After
1984 the prices will increase in accordance with the actual price increases
experienced in Ixtapa and Cancun Tourism Projects. The sales price used in
this analysis has been approved by the Director of Sales of FONATUR.
