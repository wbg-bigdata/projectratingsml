INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR A
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to the Empire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$17.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a highway project. US$1.5
million of the proceeds of the Credit would be relent to the Agricultural
and Industrial Bank (AIDB) at 7-1/4%. USAID is expected to provide a
loah of $9.3 million for a related project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report "Current Position and Prospects of the Ethiopian
Economy" (AE-21) was circulated on November 18, 1971.  A mission to review
the economy is in the field. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
3.        Virtually isolated from modern science and technology until the
middle of the twentieth century, Ethiopia is one of the least developed
of all countries. The per capita income is $64 a year and some 85% of the
population of 25 million are peasant farmers. Agriculture accounts for
about 90% of employment, 5B% of GDP, and almost all exports. Manufacture
contributes only around 5% of GDP.
4.       During the last two decades the Qovernment has made notable
efforts to accelerate the pace of development. Ethiopia is now in the
middle of its Third Five-Year Plan. The first two plans gave priority to
the development of infrastructure such as roads, telecommunications and
power, and the establishment of manufacturing industries (mainly government-
financed) based on import substitution. The third plan emphasizes the
development of agriculture and of activities such as training and feeder
road building which directly support agricultural development. However,
progress has been slow. Institutions are changing only gradually, and the
slow pace of change, such as in the land tenure system, has inhibited rapid
growth. At the same time Ethiopia has had a relatively low and somewhat
intermittent capital inflow. Coffee is the principal source of foreign
exchange but the world demand for coffee increases only slowly. Moreover,
export prices fluctuate, leading to large swings in export income. With
reapect to aid, Ethiopia, unlike many other African countries which were
formerly dependent, has had no traditional source of technical and financial
help.



- 2 -
5.        Over the past decade, per capita GDP has grown at about 24.
Growth would have been lower but for a 16% annual rate of growth of the
manufacturing sector based on import substitution. The economy was
particularly sluggish during the late 1960's. There was a sharp upturni in
the economy for about a year beginning in mid 1969 due to high coffee
prices, but the economy has been slowing down again since mid 1970. Exports
have not shown a significant upward trend and, at the end of 1971, external
reserves were at an all-time year-end low of about three months' imports.
Partly due to the slow rate of economic growth during most of the late
1960's and partly because the opportunities for further import substitution
had diminished, the growth of manufacture was less rapid than before and
the inflow of private capital declined. As a result of these developments
the pace of investment and growth was below the planned targets. Also,
while total population grew at 2.5% a year, the urban population rose at
about 7% a year and the problem of urban unemployment an: the need for
systematic urban planning became evident.
6.        It was against this background that the Bank and the Ethiopian
Government agreed to the formation of a Consultative Group for Ethiopia.
A principal purpose of the Group is to provide a forum for a dialogue
between Ethiopia and aid donors, with the hope that deeper understanding
on both sides of the development problems facing Ethiopia might lead to
some increase in the volume and effectiveness of aid. In preparation for
the inaugural meeting of the Group in May 1971, the Ethiopian Government
reviewed the progress of the Third Five-Year Plan. In general the Govern-
ment reaffirmed the main strategy and policies of the Plan, which were
to give priority to the development of agriculture and allied activities.
However, within the overall strategy there was some shift in emphasis
towards the development of peasant agriculture in order to realize the
Plan's four objectives of broadening the monetization of the economy,
expanding employment in the rural areas, achieving a more favorable income
distribution, and increasing supplies of domestic food crops. The revised
strategy also recognized the need to increase and diversify exports and
to diversify the overall economy through the development of tourism,
manufacturing, and mining. In the expectation of an increase in coffee
prices based on the incipient price recovery in 1969, new investment and
growth targets were fixed and the development plan period was extended for
a sixth year to July 1974. Unfortunately coffee prices declined again in
late 1970 and are now not expected to rise significantly. Therefore, the
new investment and growth targets for the remainder of the extended plan
may well not be realized.
7.        Turning to the longer-term future, it is clear that agriculture
will remain the dominant economic activity and that although there is some
scope for increased production for the domestic market, the main push will
have to come from increasing exports. Possibilities include livestock,
fresh fruit and vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds. Manufacturing is con-
strained by the small size of the domestic market, and the present lack
of competitive advantage in manufacturing for export. Although tourism



- 3 -
has been growing at about 14% a year it is on a small scale and Ethiopia's
tourist attractions are not such as are likely to bring mass tourism in
the near future. There are large reservesof potash but the world market
is at present well supplied, so that there appears to be little hope of
developing them, possibly until the 1980's.
8.        The Bank is taking a number of steps to support the Government's
development strategy, which appears to be sound. A mission visited Ethiopia
to make a comprehensive study of the whole agricultural sector and the
resultingreport is nearing completion. The Ethiopian Government, with IDA
assistance, has undertaken a review of the education sector to enable it
to design policies and curricula which will produce the trained manpower
needed for Ethiopia's development. The Bank is providing technical assist-
ance to rationalize the structure of tariff protection and the measures
to encourage investment, so as to promote more efficient manufacturing
development. The Bank is also executing agency for a UNDP-financed study
of internal air transport with special regard for tourism development, and
for a UNDP project which is providing a team of experts to help the Government
in improving its planning.
9.        The Agriculture Sector Mission has concluded that the problem of
Ethiopian agriculture is one of supply, marketing and processing rather than
demand and that livestock has the best export growth potential. The main
factors constraining growth are the lack of research, extension, trained
manpower, credit, marketing and transport,and the land tenure system, which
includes share cropping with no security of tenure, communal tenure, and
occupation by nomadic pastoralists. The Government is aware of these con-
straints and has taken some steps to deal with them; it has established
the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) and has submitted
legislation for tenancy reform to Parliament. Two pain difficulties
confront the Government - the shortage of resources and institutional
inflexibility.
10.       Ethiopia has an increasing capacity to plan and execute projects,
although technical assistance for these purposes will be required for
some time. There is need for a more active fiscal and monetary policy
to increase domestic savings, but in view of Ethiopia's poverty substantial
external assistance will be required to finance an investment program
commensurate with Ethiopia's needs. It is projected that the Ethiopian
Government will be able to finance about 48% of public investment from
recurrent budget surpluses and domestic borrowing over the next three
years and will have to look to external assistance for the remainder.
Since many individual projects will not be able to attract foreign assist-
ance it follows that if external assistance is to make an adequate overall
contribution, significantly more than half the cost of other projects
will have to be financed by foreign capital. This often implies external
financing of part of the local expenditures as in the case of the proposed
project. Export prospects are unfavorable; the growth of coffee export
earnings is unlikely to exceed 3% a year and other major exports are



- 4 -
likely to take a long time to develop. Hence Ethiopia will need foreign
assistance for many years.   Ethiopia's debt service ratio was 11 .4% in
1970; considering the limited prospects for the growth of exports Ethiopia
must endeavor to obtain the major portion of its external capital require-
ments on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
11.        Since 1950 when Ethiopia was the recipient of the Bank's first
loan in Africa, Ethiopia has received twelve Bank loans totalling US$108.6
million and nine IDA credits amounting to US$66.2 million. Four loans are
fully repaid and four others are fully disbursed. Since 1965, IFC has made
four commitments in Ethiopia totalling US$141. million. Annex I contains
a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC inveptments as of
April 30, 1972, with comnents on the progress of execution Qf projects, some
of which have encountered problems giving rise to delays in disbursement.
12.        Until 1969, the lending program concentrated primarily on building
Ethiopia's infrastructure of roads, power, and telecommunications.  In addi-
tion there were two loans to the Development Bank of Ethiopia and one credit
for education. Aside from some small amounts for agriculture provided under
the loans to the Development Bank of Ethiopia, the Bank Group's first lending
for agriculture in Ethiopia was the credit for the Wolamo project in 1969.
Since that time three additional credits have been made for agricultural
projects, and one credit for the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank,
one credit for education, and a loan for a water and sewerage project. This
shift in emphasis in our lending program reflects both the success of our
earlier lending in meeting the most crucial infrastructural needs, and the
increased opportunity for agricultural lending brought about in part by
improved sectoral knowledge and research findings, and the heavier emphasis
on agriculture in the Government's own priorities. While the need to finance
infrastructure will continue, it is expected that the emphasis of the Bank
Group's future lending will be placed on agriculture and supporting activities
in manpower development, marketing, credit, and transportation.
13.        In view of the high priority given to agricultural development,
the Bank, mainly through the Permanet Mission in Eastern Africa, is making
a major effort to help prepare agricultural projects. During the next 12
months I expect to present for your approval loans or credits for three
agricultural projects - one for livestock development, one for irrigated
farming and one to provide to a large number of agricultural families an
inexpensive but effective "package,, of goods and services designed to
increase production. This project would be part of the Government's
so-called "Minimum Package Program". In addition, projects in the fields
of education, telecommunications, aviation and tourism, may be ready within
FY73. In the past, external finance for agriculture has largely been applied
to projects providing a large infusion of resources to modernize farming, but
for only a relatively few farmers.  The Minimum Package Program is a new



departure in that it aims to keep expenditure per family as low as possible so
as to maximize the number of families that will benefit from improved inputs
and new techniques. The proposed education project would place a high priority
on agricultural education. The aviation project would emphasize internal
airports required for tourism development. Looking beyond FY73, further
projects are in preparation in the fields of agriculture, education and
highways, as well as additional lending for the Agricultural and Industrial
Development Bank.
14.        During 1966-70 the Bank and IDA were the largest source of official
loans, contributing 36% of gross inflows. A summary of recent external
assistance to Ethiopia by source and by sectors can be seen at Annex II.
IBRD's share of the total debt outstanding excluding undisbursed amounts
has decreased from 34% in 1965 to 31% in 1971, and due to an expected softer
blend in Bank Group lending to Ethiopia, IBRD's share of total outstanding
debt should continue to decrease.
PART III - THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
15.        For a country of its size and population, Ethiopia's transport
facilities are meager. Although public investment in transport has been
substantial, most of the population is still remote from modern means of
transportation and must rely on animals for transport. The topography of
Ethiopia is dominated by a vast plateau rising from plains in the east and
cut diagonally northeast to southwest by the Rift Valley. Two distinct rainy
seasons occur and the country is generally well-watered, with rivers originating
in the highlands and flowing mainly through deep gorges. The topographical
and climatic conditions have made provision of communications and transport
networks very difficult and expensive. Consequently many parts of the country
remain isolated with only minimum development of agriculture and other potentials
16.        The transport system focuses primarily on Addis Ababa, and
secondarily on Asmara in the north, Jimma in the southwest, and Assab on
the Red Sea. Highways are the dominant mode.   The Imperial Highway Authority
(IRA), created and developed with Bank Group assistance, is responsible for
the development and maintenance of Ethiopia's road network. The main trunk
road system is fairly well developed with about 8,000 km of all-weather roads
serving about 42,000 registered vehicles.  However, there is almost a complete
lack of low class, rural development roads. (See map attached)
17.        The Red Sea ports of Assab and Massawa on its own territorial
coast and Djibouti in the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas serve
Ethiopia. Arrangements have been made with the Japanese Government for
financing the preparation of a Ports Master Plan. The Franco-Ethiopian
Railway (FER) joins Addis Ababa and Djibouti and the Northern Ethiopian



Railway (NER) operates from Massawa to Asmara and Agordat in Northern
Eritrea.  The PER, 50% owned by the Ethiopian Government and 50% by the French
Government and private French shareholders, is the more important.
Its source of revenue is Ethiopian traffic through the port of Djibouti. The
recent decline in tonnage and revenues has been reversed, and the FER is no
longer running at a deficit. The NER has been running serious annual deficits
since 1967, and a proposal for its closure is currently under study by the
Planning Commission.
18.        Ethiopiats two main airports at Addis Ababa and Asmara are
currently being equipped with night landing facilities and their run-
ways lengthened and strengthened for modern aircraft. Fran these airports,
Ethiopia's international airline and a number of other airlines link Ethiopia
with Europe and Asia, as well as several other African countries.
Domestic flights are made to as many as 43 airfields,but facilities at most of
these are minimal, and many are open only during the dry season. A study now
nearing completion, financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency,
is expected to provide a basis for the future development of domestic aviation.
19.        The main constraints to transport development have been the large
size and difficult terrain of the country, the lack of qualified staff to
plan and execute projects, shortage of finance, and the lack of organization
and planning for farm-to-market roads. Considerable progress has been made
in overcoming the institutional staffing and financial constraints with the
help of foreign assistance - from France for the main railway, the United
States for aviation, and the Bank and a few bilateral sources for highways.
20.        In the past the main priority in the transportation sector has
been given to expanding and improving the road network, mostly trunk roads.
However, in keeping with the priority accorded to agriculture, the Third
Five-Year Plan changes the emphasis from trunk roads to lower-class roads
which will link farmers to sources of inputs and to markets. Following
this lead, the UNDP, with the Bank as executing agency, financed a General
Roads Study completed in 1969 which provides the framework for the balanced
development of trunk and minor roads.
21.        As noted above, the Bank Group lending strategy for Ethiopia assigns
highest priority to agricultural development. The main lending in the
transport sector will be for roads and, in line with the Third Five-Year
Plan and the General Roads Study, it will emphasize those roads which
complement and promote expansion and improvement in the agricultural sector.
Accordingly, the proposed highway project assists in the construction and
improvement of lower-class roads oriented principally towards rural develop-
ment. It will also seek to bring about continued institutional improvement
by providing technical assistance for the Imperial Highway Authority, the
local contracting industry and the study and development of an organization
for the planning and construction of farm-to-market roads.

PART IV - THE PROJBCT
22.      A report entitled "Ethiopia: Appraisal of a Fifth Highway Project"
(PTR-124 dated June 14, 1972 is being distributed separately. A Credit and
Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
23.      In November 1971 a mission to Ethiopia appraised for possible
Bank Group financing a program to build feeder roads and upgrade primary
roads which had been prepared by IHA in line with the priorities established
in the General Roads Study (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). From the
appraisal of this program two projects were worked out, one to be financed
by the proposed IDA credit and one to be financed by a proposed USAID loan.
Negotiations for the proposed Development Credit and the proposed USAID loan
were held in Washington on May 17-30, 1972. The Ethiopian Delegation was
led by H.E. Ato Saleh Hinit, Minister of Public Works and Water Resources,
assisted by H.E. Ato Ashenafi Shifferaw, Vice-Minister, Ministry of Finance,
Ato Abashawl Woldemariam, General Manager of the Imperial Highway Authority,
Ato Shimelis Asfaw, Acting Executive Assistant to the General Manager of IHAA,
Ato Zaudou Meshesha, Lawyer for IHA and Ato Teferra Wblde Semait, Financial
and Economic Counselor, Ethiopian Enbassy, Washington, D.C.
24.      The proposed $17 million Development Credit would assist in financing
the construction and supervision of six gravel surfaced feeder roads (434 km);
technical assistance and research and training equipment to further strengthen
the operations of the Imperial Highway Authority; loans and technical assist-
ance designed to aid the development of local Ethiopian road contractors; and
a study of the organizational and operational requirements for the construction
and maintenance of rural roads. Total cost of the proposed project is estimated
at $22.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of $14 million equivalent.
The Development Credit would finance about 77% of total cost and would be
disbursed against the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance,of loans
for equipment purchases by local contractors and of research and training
equipment, and 75% of the cost for road construction and supervision, which
would include about US$3.0 million equivalent of local costs. (The justifi-
cation for local cost financing is given in paragraph 10 above) The Govern-
ment's contribution, estimated at $5.0 million, would provide about 23% of
project cost.
25.      The proposed USAID loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange
cost, $9.3 million, of the upgrading and bituminous surfacing of three primary
roads which have been constructed as gravel roads under previous Bank Group
projects, together with the provision of immediate requirements for road
maintenance equipment. The loan would be for 40 years including a 10-year
grace period, with interest at 2 percent during the grace period and 3 percent
thereafter. The local costs, $3.6 million, would be financed by the Government.
USAID would have full responsibility for supervising the project financed under
its loan, but USAID and the Association would consult together as required
to ensure coordination of the two projects.



26.      The six gravel roads to be financed by the Association are in areas
of rich agricultural potential. Five of these roads are required to facili-
tate programs of regional development under the Government's ongoing Minimum
Package Program for provision of extension services and credit for the purchase
of improved agricultural inputs. It was agreed during negotiations that
agricultural development programs acceptable to the Association would be
implemented in the areas of influence of these roads on or before completion
of their construction. The sixth road would replace a dry-weather track which
currently provides access to a regional agricultural project financed by the
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA).
27.      Although the agricultural benefits of providing access to the regions
to be served by the proposed roads are sufficient to justify gravel roads
meeting IHA feeder road standards, there are other areas of agricultural
potential for which only provision of lower standard farm to market roads
can be justified at this stage. Development of such areas is held back by
the lack of an organized approach for the planning, financing, construction,
and maintenance of roads below feeder road standards. While some farm to
market roads have been constructed ad hoc by local governors or by agricul-
tural project organizations, these efforts have been limited and uncoordinated.
The Government has recognized the need for a national approach to the problem
and has established an interministerial committee under the Planning Commission
to recommend suitable organizational and operational arrangements for the con-
struction of farm to market roads. Two experts would be provided to the
Planning Commission under the proposed Credit to assist the interministerial
committee in these efforts and later to help in the implementation of the
resulting recommendations.
28.      The Project also provides for assistance to the local contracting
industry, which will play a significant part in developing local skills and
experience and will become increasingly important as additional emphasis
is placed on construction of lower class roads in scattered rural areas.
Local contractors so far have participated in road construction only to a
very small extent. There are, however, a number of competent local civil
works contractors who are interested in expanding into road construction but
who lack experience in pricing, organizing and executing roadworks and also
generally lack funds to purchase necessary equipment. It is therefore proposed
that the Project would include (a) an advisor to IHA to help train local con-
tractors and (b) $1.5 million to finance construction equipment needed by
successful local bidders on road works.
29.      The funds for financing local contractors' equipment needs would
be relent to the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank at 7-1/4% for
onlending to local contractors at not less than 9-1/2%. AIDB will normally
require a down-payment of 25% of equipment cost and will take a mortgage on
the equipment procured. Since this is less than AIDB's normal requirements
for collateral, the Government would guarantee 50% of any losses to AIDB.
A Credit for $11 million to help finance AIDB loans to industrial and agricul-
tural enterprises was approved on April 25, 1972. AIDB has also been the



- 9 -
credit channel in two previous agricultural credits. IHA will assist AIDB
by providing an evaluation of the technical qualifications and equipment
requirements of local contractors.
30.      IHA will be responsible for executing all project items except
for the rural roads study, which will be the responsibility of the Planning
Commission, and the loans to local contractors, which will be handled by
AIDB. The IHA was created in 1951 in connection with the First Highway
Project as an autonomous agency under a Board of Commissioners, and is
entrusted with the responsibility for the development and maintenance of
Ethiopia's highway network. While originally heavily dependent upon
foreign technical assistance, the number of expatriate staff has been
gradually reduced as suitably qualified and experienced Ethiopian staff
have become available. However, IHA is expanding its activities in the
fields of preparation of feasibility studies, road design, and maintenance
which creates additional needs for technical assistance. The proposed
project provides IRA with technical assistance in the form of (1) an expert
to continue to advise on reorganization of administrative procedures and
to help implement improved technical auditing and costing; (2) a design
engineer to assist IHA in improving the quality of its design work;
(3) a transportation economist to advise the IHA Planning and Programming
Division on improved planning procedures; (4) an expert on road construction
materials to carry out research and developpavement design and construction
practices related to local materials and sub-surface conditions; (5) two
experts on road maintenance organization and operations; and (6) an expert
to assist in coordinating the procurement, storage and workshop procedures
of IHA's Equipment and Supply Division. In addition, the Project includes
funds for the purchase of additional training equipment and materials to
bring up-to-date several courses at the IHA training center and equipment
to be used by IRA for local materials research.
31.      The proposed roads to be constructed under the project are estimated
to have a combined economic return of 23%, with individual returns ranging
from 16% to 43%. Investment in five of the project roads is a prerequisite
for agricultural development planned as part of the Government's Minimum
Package Program. The analysis of economic return compared the combined net
benefits of these roads and the agricultural services made possible by these
roads with the combined costs of the roads and agricultural services, in-
cluding extension service, fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs. The
sixth road, serving a fertile area being developed with assistance from the
Swedish Government, is justified based upon savings in transport costs
through replacing the present dry-weather track.
32.      Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. In order to attract foreign bidders as well
as to permit local contractors to tender for works of a size within their
capabilities, contracts would be tendered either individually or combined
into bidding groups, at the bidder's option. Thus sizes of contracts
could vary between $900,000 and $5.8 million. The equipment and supplies
for training and materials research (US$200,000) would be prooured on the



- 10 -
basis of bidding procedures, to be approved by IDA, providing adequate
competition. Read construction equipment financed by AIDB loans would
be purchased by the road contractors through normal commercial channels.
33.      The project will be implemented over about a four-year period.
It is expected that all feeder road construction will have commenced by
mid-1973 and be completed by mid-1976. Technical assistance to IHA and
aid to local contractors, should begin by early 1973 and be completed
in about two years. Technical assistance to the Planning Commission for
the rural roads study should begin in early 1973 and the study completed
in one year with the assistance continued for a further year during
implementation. Equipment for research and training should be procured
by mid-1973.
PART V - LEIAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Imperial Highway Authority, the Recommenda-tion of
the Committee provided for under Article V, Section I(d), of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
35.      The draft agreements reflect the normal pattern for credits for
highway projects. The relending of that part of the proceeds of the Credit
for onlending to local contractors will be governed by a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Empire of Ethiopia and AIDB satisfactory to the
Association. The execution of the subsidiary loan agreement has been
specified as a condition of effectiveness of the Development Credit
Agreement.
36.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
37.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Most projects are proceeding satisfactorily. The following
projects have encountered delays:
Credit 35-ET of February 27, 1963 (Third Highway) - The remaining
$700,000 can not be disbursed until the Government and contractors have
concluded arbitration proceedings arising out of claims concerning
completed road construction. The arbitration proceedings are well
advanced with findings expected to be furnished soon.
Loan 523-ET and Credit 111-ET of January 15, 1968 (Fourth Highway)    -
A delay in disbursement resulted from slow progress in the preparation of
acceptable tender documents and ccntract prequalification. The small
number of responses to the first tender required a second tender with
some changed conditions. Contracts were finally signed in July and
August 1969 and work is now proceeding normally. The Closing Date has
been extended by two years to June 30, 1974.

Note Concerning Attached Map
There is no standard spelling of Ethiopian names
in the Roman alphabet. The attached map uses the spelling
employed in the official IHA highway map, which is different
from that employed by many other Government agencies. For
example, the map uses Addis Abeba and Mitsiwa in place of
Addis Ababa and Massawa which are the more usual English
spellings.
