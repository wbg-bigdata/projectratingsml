MEKORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNAT1ONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Poland for US$100 million equivalent for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity including
five years grace and would help finance an agricultural development project.
2.    Background: Under its Economic Transformation Program, the Polish
Government is according high priority to the development of the rural sector,
which accounts for about 40% of the country's population. The rural economy
has a potential for employment creation which can offset some of the
unemployment occurring in the urban areas. Agriculture assumes special
significance with a share of about 12% of GDP, 20% of exports and 28X of the
total labor force. A joint Polish-EEC-World Bank task force on agriculture
which visited Poland during May-July 1990 identified priorities for action,
and consistent with these priorities the proposed project is aimed at
assisting Poland in the reform of rural cooperatives, including rural
cooperative banks, as key institutions that channel resources to the rural
sector.
3.    There are some 8,000 rural cooperatives involved in banking, input
distribution and output marketing, production and processing. Cooperatives
had been forced under the previous system to serve as an instrument of state
policy and, as such, did not have a truly cooperative character or an ability
to function efficiently. The cooperatives now need to be transformed into
private sector, member-controlled institutions, consistent with the
Government's program for the establishment of a market economy. The project
is designed to assist this process.
4.    Government's program-for the development of rural communities revolves
around strengthening the private sector. An important ingredient in this
effort will be the provision and efficient allocation of investment capital.
To this end, the majority of the 1,660 cooperative banks, which constitute
Poland's principal rural financial institutions and are to be reformed as part
of an ongoing transformation of the national financial system with assistance
by a range of multilateral and bilateral agencies, would receive assistance
under the project.
5.    Rationale for Bank involvement: The project would be an important
element within the Bank's efforts to encourage the Polish Government to
implement a comprehensive strategy for agriculture and rural development,
based on private initiative in a free market economy. The participating rural
institutions would be reformed and strengthened and related policy and
regulatory frameworks developed. Achievement of this objective would lay the
groundwork for other related Bank projects and further the Bank's overall
assistance strategy.
6.    The Bank has been involved in the development of the financial sector,
through the SAL and the preparation of a proposed sector operation. The SAL



is supporting overall policy and institutional reforms, while the proposed
Financial Institutions Development Loan would focus on the strengthening of
the nine regionalized commercial banks. The proposed project would support
the development of the rural part of the financial sector. A proposed Private
Sector Development Project would focus on a strategy for industrial
enterprises primarily in the urban sector. The present project would
complement these efforts in the rural sector.
7.    The cooperative sector generally has been attracting considerable
interest from foreign donors, but assistance provided so far has been
piecemeal, and its success is likely to be limited. Through the project, the
Bank would assist in developing a suitable institutional framework for the
Polish authorities to coordinate external assistance more effectively.
8.    Project Objectives: The project is designed to support private farmers
and promote other private sector activities in rural areas, primarily through
the restructuring of high-priority rural cooperatives (e.g., cooperative banks
and marketing, dairy and horticulture cooperatives). More specifically, the
project would: start transforming existing rural cooperatives from social
sector organizations to member-controlled, market-oriented business
enterprises; help develop rural commercial enterprises by improving access to
credit; and provide investment funds for business and institutional
development in rural communities.
9.    ProJect Description: The project would comprise (i) institution-building
activities for about 2,400 rural cooperatives and cooperative banks through
(a) technical assistance aimed at strengthening individual agricultural
cooperatives and primary cooperative banks and creating a suitable apex
structure at regional and national levels, and (b) establishment of a Capital
Fund for cooperative banks; and (ii) a credit program to provide medium- and
long-term credit for investments in agriculture, agroindustry and other rural
productive sectors. Farmers, individual entrepreneurs, private cooperatives,
private enterprises as well as former state enterprises which have been
privatized would be eligible for borrowing.
10.   The total project cost is estimated to be US$180.2 million, of which
US$108.6 million is foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$100.0
million equivalent would meet 92X of the foreign exchange requirements of the
project. Parallel grants totaling US$20.2 million from the EEC and other
sources would meet an additional 8X of foreign exchange requirements and also
cover 16X of local costs for institutional development. The local cost of
investments would be met by subborrowers and financial intermediaries. The
maxiimum size of subloans would be US$5.0 million. The proposed Capital Fund
in the amount of US$20.0 million equivalent would be established with
contributions from Government and external (i.e., EEC and U.S.) sources.
11.   Procurement under subloans financed under the credit component of the
project would be in accordance with normal commercial practice, since no
contract is expected to exceed US$1.0 million and the beneficiaries would be
private entities. Import regulations have been sufficiently liberalized to
allow foreign suppliers into the Polish market on a competitive basis.
Procurement related to TA would be in accordance with cofinanciers'
procurement procedures.



12.   Disbursements would be against subloan expenditures on the basis of
certified Statements of Expenditures. A Special Account would be established
covering about four months' expenditures. The loan closing date is June 30,
1995.  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Scbedule
The procurement method, with amounts, and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the Status of
Bank Group operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9436-POL, dated May 20, 1991, is being
distributed separately.
13.   Agreed Actions: At negotiations, agreements were obtained regarding: (a)
establishment of the proposed Cooperative Development Unit (CDU) in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy as a condition of effectiveness, and
appointment of CDU's Executive Director, Cooperative Management Adviser,
Cooperative Training Adviser and Cooperative Development Adviser by December
31, 1991, and of an adequate number of additional specialists promptly as
needed; (b) establishment by Government of a proposed Capital Fund for
cooperative banks in the initial amount O0 US$10.0 million equivalent as a
condition of effectiveness, and expansion of the Fund by an additional US$10.0
million by the time 90% of the initial amount of the fund has been utilized;
(c) effectiveness by October 31, 1992 of cofinancing agreements, other than
those referred to below as a condition of effectiveness, providing for
financing in an aggregate amount equivalent to US$20.0 million; (d) drafting
of a new Cooperative Law and submission of a completed draft to Parliament by
June 30, 1992; (e) eligibility criteria for participating second-tier and
cooperative banks, including compliance with NBP regulations, capital adequacy
ratio, satisfactory financial condition and performance, auditing of accounts
and financial statements, and adoption of recommendations on investment
lending guidelines; (f) eligibility criteria for private-sector subborrowers,
with adequate financial ratios in the case of joint stock and cooperative
enterprises, and criteria for investments, such as demonstrated financial
viability of investments in fixed assets and permanent working capital; (g)
terms and conditions of financing subloans, including onlending either in
local currency, at NBP's basic rate, or in US dollars at a floating interest
rate linked to the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate; (h) establishment
in NBP of a credit monitoring system by June 30, 1992; and (i) undertaking
subprojects in accordance with appropriate environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank. Furthermore, agreement was obtained on the
following additional conditions of effectiveness: effectiveness of cofinancing
agreements, providing for financing in an aggregate amount equivalent to
US$20.0 million; execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement on behalf of the
Borrower and NBP; and receipt by the Bank of at least one subsidiary loan
agreement between NBP and a financial intermediary.
14.   Proiect Benefits: The main benefit would be the creation of viable rural
cooperative institutions to serve the private sector, with particularly
favorable impact on rural financial intermediation and agricultural marketing.
Broader access to credit would help stimulate a supply response and, by
supporting new business entrants, contribute to creating a competitive
economic environment. The project also would create alternative employment
opportunities and, through its positive overall effect on economic efficiency,
make the country more competitive in international markets.



. 4 -
15.   Riskg: The main overall risk is adverse changes in macroeconomic
conditions which could affect the entire agriculture sector and the demand for
credit. This risk will be mitigated in the context of the intense country
dialogue as well as the preparation and implementation of SALs and other loans
that are central to the reform effort. The main project risk is that subloans
will not be fully or promptly repaid. This could occur because there is
little experience with lending to private farmers and small businesses in a
free market environment. To address this problem, banks' risk management
capability would be improved through the project's management and training
assistance and the application of sound lending criteria. There is also a
possibility that institution building will not be as successful as
anticipated, in which case the technical assistance approach may have to be
modified in the course of project implementation. Another risk is that
progress with overall financial sector reforms is slow, hindering
institutional development of cooperative banks. While this would affect
project disbursements, the project would continue to be implemented by the
accredited non-cooperative banks already involved in lending under existing
projects, with the proposed technical assistance.
16.   Recommendations: I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
