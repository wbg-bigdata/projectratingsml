PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Marib-Safir Road
Project, Repuolic of Yemen (unified si.nce May 22, 1990) for which an IDA
Credit (1726-YAR) in the amount of SDR 8.6 million was approved on September
5, 1986. The Credit was closed on December 31, i990, six months later than
originally expected. It was totally disbursed by April 27, 1991.
The PCR was jointly prepared by Infrastructure Operations Division,
Country Department III of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's final supervision
mission of the project in December 1990 and is based, inter-alia. on
information contained in the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, quarterly progress reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and information
gathered in the country.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.    The primary objectives of the project were to facilitate the exploration
of oil in the Safir area and transportation of oil products from the refinery
in the area, and to further improve agricultural development in the area
through the provision of a paved road from Marib to Safir (para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
2.    Physical project implementation was essentially completed nearly nine
months ahead of the estimated time with a 25% cost underrun. Additional work
undertaken with the uncommitted funds was also completed by the original
completion date (paras. 5.01 to 5.03). An item of special interest was the
use of force account for the construction of the road works. Another
interesting and important experience was the exposure, for the first time in
Yemen, to archaeological and cultural remains of the country in connection
with an IDA-financed project (para. 5.04).
Results
3.    The project succeeded in providing a much needed paved road for this
remote area in a desert region with shifting sand dunes, thus enabling the
exploration and exploitation of the oil field at Safir and improved economic
activity in the region (paras. 6.01 to 6.03). The potential impact on the
archaeological monuments in the area was not foreseen during appraisal.
However, steps were taken to mitigate this impact immediately during project
implementation (para. 6.04).
Sustainabilitv
4.    The sustainability of the project hinges on (i) the capability of the
Highway Department to provide the increased maintenance of the road due to
much higher than forecast traffic, and (ii) the physical execution of "Marib
Master Plan". Action on (i) is being fulfilled satisfactorily, but action on
(ii) needs to be expedited (paras. 7.01 and 7.02).



iii
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.    The project experience provides the following main lessons: (i) use of
force account as   vehicle for procurement is a viable option for road
cor.struction in remote, and not always stable, tribal areas, where local
knrwledge and diplomatic skills are important. Longer mobilization time would
be a high probability if the usual ICB were to be pursued. Full commitment of
the Government is essential to the success of this procurement procedure
(paras. 5.01 and 9.02); (ii) full environmental impact assessment before
project appraisal, even in remote desert areas, is imperative because of the
possible existence of hidden archaeological remains. It is critical to
involve the archaeological and antiquities authorities of the country, as well
as the local authorities of the project area, to ascertain the existence of
such sites during the feasibility study, so that necessary measures can be
taken to protect the monuments before the start of engineering works(para.
6.04); and (iii): such an approach would have allowed earlier development of
the potential for Tourism and, therefore, further contributed to the project
benefits (para. 7.02).

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Pr&ect Identity
Project Name:     Marib-Safir Road Project
Credit Number:    1726-YAR
P.VP Unit:        EMENA Region, (  tttry Department III
Country:          Republic of Yemen (Formerly Northern Governorate:
Yeimen Arab Republic)
Sector:           Transport
Subsector:        Highways
2.    Proiect Background
2.01        Tne Republic of Yemen (ROY) occupies an area (537,000 sq. km) of
largely mountainous terrain in the northern region, and a desertic area in the
southern and eastern regions with a widely dispersed population of about 11.5
million people (1990). As a consequence of this setting, both the demand for
transport and cost of providing transport services are high. Until about 1560
ROY lacked a modern transport system. Land transport was essentially over
primitive tracks, port facilities were limited to tha ports of Aden and Mocha.
and there was no air service within the country. Progress started following
the end of the civil war in 1972. The fast pace of economic development in
neighbouring countries in the 1970s provided employment opportunities for
Yemeni workers and absorbed about 30% of the Yemeni work force.
2.02        The resulting increases in workers' remittances fuelled an
economic boom in Yemen, particularly in the transport sector. The main
factors which contributed to this upsurge in transport demand were: (i)
financial support from the migrant labor force to build transport links to
their villages; (ii) increasing migration of rural people to urban areas while
maintaining close ties to their villages; (iii) structural changes in the
pattern and level of consumption requiring much larger imports; and (iv) an
ambitious development program spurring construction activities in various
sectors on a massive scale.
2.03        Traffic on all modes grew at unprecedented levels during the
1970s, but decreased during the 1980s to more normal levels due to a decline
in workers' remittances caused by the recession in the Gulf States and general
slowdown in economic activities. During the last 20 years. ROY has built up
the framework of a modern transport system consisting of about 6,500 km of
main roads (4,500 km paved), two modern sea ports at Aden and Hodeidah, four
secondary ports, five international airports and internal air services. Yemen
does not have a rail system and is totally dependent on roads for surface
transportation.

2.04        Because of the discovery of oil i.. 1984 and construction of a
10,000 bbd refinery (30% of Yemen's consumption) at the oil wells site
(Safir), construction of this road connecting Safir with the paved road
network at Marib became of high priority. The project was fully responsive to
the traasport sector and macro-economic policy objectives, including foreign
exchange earnings and savings and tourism promotion.
3.    Project Obiectives and Comronents
3.01        Proiect Obiectives:  The original objectives of the project were
to facilitate the following:
(i)   the substitution of domestic oil for imported products by
permitting the transport of white products from a refinery at the
oil field at Safir to domestic markets;
(ii)  further development of the oil fields;
(iii) road access that would enable the movement of agricultural inputs
and the marketing of agricultural products to the Wadi As Sudd
area; and
(iv)  increase the capability of the Highway Authority (HA) to design
road works.
3.02        Proiect Components:  The project, implemented over the period
1987-1990, included:
(i)   completion to naved standard of a new road from Marib to Safir
(62.5 km) which was being constructed to gravel standard (sub
base) by HA force account with government financing; and
(ii!  the supervision of construction by consultants.
4.    Proiect Design t!nd Orqanization
4.01        The project was appraised in November 1985.  The HA played an
important role in the preparation of the project as a result of the maturity
it had r-.ched, through previous IDA projects.  The HA prepared the
feasibility study and detailed engineering design documents for the project.
Six different itineraries were studied and compared in order to (i) achieve
optimal integration of and service to the nearly 100,000 people settled at the
border of the desert along the first 35 km of the road, and (ii) avoid as much
as possible the shifting sand dunes in the last section of the road. All the
soil tests were carried out at the HA laboratory (supervised by consultants
and IDA), partly financed under the Third Highway Project (Credit 794-YAR).
The design concepts underlying the individual components were appropriate at
the time of identification, preparation, appraisal and execution.
4.02        The HA started constructing the first phase of the road by force



3
account to gravel (20 cm eub--ase) standard using its own funds for
constru-tion and thoae fram Credit 1413-YAR, for supervision of works by
conœultants. It lacked funds to complete the road to asphalt standard and
proposed to complete the road (base, shculders and wearing course) to paved
standard with IDA financing, also with force account, under the proposed
project. The reasons for this exceptiorial proposal were:
(i)   HA was satisfactorily constructing the
road to sub-base standard by force
account. To co;.ple'e the road to asphalt
standard by a contractor would have
delayed construction by about 9 months
(the duration of the ICB procurement
process) and cou_ hz-e increased the cost
of mobii5.zation and maintenance, thus
resulting in a loss of expected vehicle
operating cost savings, and lack of clear
accountability when a contractor completes
work begun by others; and
(ii) the tribal nature of a remote area where a
private contractor would have experienced
difficulties on issues related to use of
land and water because local tribes have
jurisdiction over land and water rights.
HA had already secured the necessary land
and water for its operation which a new
contractor may not be able to do.
4.03        During negotiations in May 1986, the Yemeni delegation reiterated
its request to complete construction of the Marib-Safir Road by force account
rather than by a contractor selected under international competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures.   Given the above mentioned circumstances, IDA's agreement
to a combination of ICB for procurement of construction materials (bitumen)
and force account for the execution of works was given on an exceptional basi3
and was not to be viewed as a precedent.
4.04        The Central Planning Organization (CPO) was the client
representing the Government with the overall responsibility for supervision of
the works, and HA was the contiactor.  The CPO then employ-  a foreign
-'nsulting firm to supervise the actual construction work. A separate
,jreement was drawn between CPO and HA to assure that ;he force account works
would be carried out to agreed standards, to approve disbursements with the
assistance of foreign consultants, and to monitor project costs. A special
account was opened in the Central Bank of Yemen to be used exclusively for
financing IDA's share of expenditures (55% of works expenditure and 100% of
foreign expenditure for goods and consultant services) under the Credit
Agreement.

5.    PKrOeet Imolementation
F.01        The project was originally scheduled to be completed In June 1989
after a two-year implementation period. IDA's deciaion to finance force
account operationa had a very positive impact on project implementation. The
immediate commencement of works and the lowar unit prices of HA compared to
the prevailing international prices resulted in cost savings estimated at SDR
1.8 million. Works were of excellent quality and were completed in March
1988, nine months ahead of the estimated completion date at appraisal report.
5.02        The Government requested IDA agreement for the use ov the
uncommitted funds of SDR 1.8 million, otherwise to be cancelled, inter alia,
for the overlay of port.'.ons of the Marib-Sana'a (170 km) road, the only
asphalted link of the p._oject area with the rest of the country. The road
constructed for light traffic in 1982 had been considerably damaged by the
heavy oil traffic, the heavy construction equipment deployed in the Marib-
Safir road works and the traffic generated by the pro4ect road. HA prepared a
feasibility and design study which fully justified the overlay. IDA approved
the economic and technical studies for the road. The financing of this
additional comtponent under the Credit was agreed to by IDA and the Credit
Agreement was amended on March 2, 1989.
5.03        This amendment to the completed works provided for the following
enlarged projects (a) the overlay of a Sana'a-Marib road section (80 km), (b)
construction of a 150-heavy vehicle parking lot at the end of the road at
Safir and of its 200 meter asphalt link to the road, (c) rehabilitation and
asphalting of the secondary road connecting the Marib-Safir road with the old
(monument) and new dams of Marib(10 km) and its 50-vehicle parking lot, (d)
construction of a 1 km access road to the Sabaean Awwan (Bilqis) temple and a
25 vehicle patrking lot, (e) acquisition of two vehicles for vigilance of the
archaeological area of Marib, and (f) the preparation of an Archeological
Master Plan drawn up by consultants, the General Organization of Antiquities
&nd Libraries (GOAL), and the German Archaeological Institute (GAI).
5.04        During the early stages of the project implementation, it was
recognized that the road network threads through the historical monuments
which extend to an area of about 15 sq. km around Harib, the capital of the
ancient kingdom of Saba. The Sabaean monuments which were partially buried
under the sand dunes for over 2,000 years are an archaeological treasure house
of international importance. Their preservation is a matter of some concern
amongst archaeological interest groups around the world. Because of
Lncreasing traffic and ease of access resulting from the road, these
archaeological sites became more vulnerable to damage. Without appropriate
protective measures, an increase in the rate of damage was anticipated.
S.05        IDA saw this as an opportunity to assist the Governmsnt of YAR in
putting into effect a program for safeguarding the historic and archaeological
sites. An IDA supervision mission approached GOAL in Yemen to prepare an
Action Plan. The steps outlined in paras 5.03 (c) to (e) were part of an
"Action Plan for Safeguarding of the Sabaean Monuments". An investment of US$
200,000 was provided under the Credit towards the implementation of the Action



5
Plan, which included fencing of a few monuments, a storage facility for
archaeological remains, purchase of two vehicles for a team of four policemen,
and most importantly, the preparation of "Master Plan Marib" (para. 7.02).
6.    Proiect Results and Economic Re-evaluation
6.01        Overall, the project was successful in meeting the principal
objectives of facilitating transport of oil products from the refinery to
domestic markets, marketing of agricultural products to the Wadi As Sudd area.
It has opened the Rub Al Khali (Empty Quarter) desert area to systematic oil
exploration and agricultural development. In addition it has promoted savings
in foreign exchange due to reduced imports of refined oil. It has also
provided greater integration of this remote area with the rest of the country.
The capability of HA to design and construct road works has been vastly
enhanced as a result of its participation in this project.
6.02        The project had a very positive impact on the economic development
of the eastern region which includes the western border of the Rub Al Khali
(Empty Quarter) desert. At least 14,000 hectares of added land have been
brouqht under cultivation due to the accessibility provided by the new road
network to the new dam and wells. The road has facilitated movement of
agriculturri p.-duce and fruits to the markets. Two new hotels have come up
since the completion of the project. There is tourist traffic of over 150
persons a day in the area where there were none five years ago.
6.03        Marib - Safir Road Construction   The SAR is lacking in analysis
and data underlying the estimated IRR of 13% for the upgrading of the Marib -
Safir road. Furthermore, the economic evaluation study undertaken by the
consultants (Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, UK) upon which the project was based
estimated an IRR of nearly 60%. Consequently, it is not possible to prepare a
strictly comparable reevaluation. Nonetheless, with a calculated IRR of 63%
the component was clearly economically rentable. The primary reason for the
difference in the SAR IRR estimate and the recalculated figure was the under-
estimation of the traffic generation effect of the new road (para. 6.04).
6.04        The 1990 traffic count taken at km 20 of this 60.5 km road records
traffic of 1,951 vpd par rapport with the consultant's estimate of 438 vpd;
although the consultant's estimate for heavy vehicles of 370 vpd (50% oil
traffic) was closer to the 1990 actual of 591 vpd. Again, the tremendous
potential impact of the new road and new Marib dam on the region's economic
and social activity was not foreseen. This situation presents a common
dilemma in feasibility studies which is frequently ignored. That is to say, to
assume that the present traffic could have used the original track road with,
consequently, the benefit stream being the difference between operating costs
on the track road and the project road, is clearly unrealistic as, in the
absence of the new road, the growth in traffic would simply not have taken
place. It is probable that the heavy vehicles serving the Safir oil
development could have continued to use the track road and, thus, the
difference in their operating costs i6 a valid benefit. The majority of the



6
rest of the traffic must be considered as generated traffic and, assuming a
downward sloping demand curve via a vis operating costs, actual benefits, in a
simplified way, should be calculated as 50% of the vehicle operating cost
savings between the track road and the project road. This approach has been
adopted in the, albeit partial, reevaluation of the rate of return.
Furthermore, it has been assumed that, following the construction of the
pipeline to the coast, the amount of oil traffic declines substantially after
1990 and that there is a 5% growth rate for other traffic. Consequently, an
order of magnitude stream of costs and benefits (YR million at constant
prices) and resultant economic Internal Rate of Return is as follows:

1999                                   57                           57
2000                                   60                           60
Economic Internal Rate of Return: 63%
It is clear, however, that this reevaluation, although demonstrating that the
project was strongly justified, can only be crude in the absence of additional
research. The possibility of carrying out this research as part of one of the
ongoing Bank financed projects should be discussed with the Government. Not
only would such a study be useful in improving the Project Completion Report
but it would also be of benefit to the Government in developing improved
traffic forecasting which is important in selecting appropriate road designs
and in planning road maintenance. For example, with this considerably higher
level of traffic than was assumed at the time of the road design and
construction, doubts must arise regarding the future life of the road and the
maintenance effort required.
6.05        Sana'a - Marib Road Strenothenino:  The February, 1989 feasibility
study of this additional component of the project was carried out by the staff
of the, then, Highway Authority assisted by technical assistance personnel.
The cost benefit analysis of the 45 km section of road assumed that the
component was basically periodic road maintenance with a conservative life of
5 years - 1990 to 1994. The cost stream included the cost of the overlay and
annual maintenance whilst the benefit stream consisted of vehicle operating
cost savings and savings in road maintenance. The analysis tested three
traffic growth scenarios of 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% and, based on these, the
component yielded economic Internal Rates of Return (IRR) of 41.4%, 46.5% and
42.5% respectively. The lower IRR for the 7.5% growth rate was due to



7
assuming that a thicker overlay would be required thus increasing the
construction cost by 15%.
6.06        In the event, traffic growth over the period 1986 to 1990 for the
whole road has averaged 23.4% p.a. with heavy vehicles increasing at 32.7%
p.a. compared with the feasibility study assumption of 4.8%: for the 45km
section the average growth rate was marginally lower at 22.6%. In the two
years 1989 and 1990, the traffic grew at 43% p.a. It is clear that the
feasibility study severely underestimated the impact of the construction of
the Marib - Safir road on the oil traffic and, together with the new Marib
Dam, on the agricultural and tourist traffic traffic of the region. This very
high rate of growth is not expected to continue and, indeed, may fall back to
the national average of between 4% and 5%. However, the high scenario 1990
base figure used in the analysis was only 56% of the actual figure.
Consequently, the benefit stream has been significantly underestimated.
6.07        As regards costs, the final cost is not yet available but will
probably be close to the YR30 million estimate for construction of the 5cm
overlay and annual maintenance costs of YR1 million. Using these revised
traffic and voc figures we arrive at the following net cash flows (YR millions
at constant prices) and economic IRRe:
2.5% Growth Rate         5% Growth Rate      7.5% Growth Rate
1989           -30.0                      -30.0               -34.5
1990             55.4                      55.4                55.4
1991            56.8                       58.2                59.6
1992            58.2                       61.2                64.1
1993            59.7                       64.3                69.0
1994            61.2                       67.5                74.3
Economic IRRs  183.2                      188.5               166.4
Such high rates of return are, of course, not unusual for road maintenance
projects.
6.08        Total Proiect   The total project cost is estimated at YR180
million of which the two road components, described above, comprised an
estimated YR107 million. The remaining components consisted of supplementary
works in the Marib/Safir region, including (i) access roads to archaeological
sites; (ii) access to the new Marib dam; (iii) parking for oil traffic at
Safir and at archaeological sites; and (iv) technical assistance for the
preparation of a Master Plan for preservation of Sabaen antiquities and
development of an archaeological park: none of these were subjected to
economic evaluation but were clearly environmentally necessary and justified.
The overall Economic IRR for the project, including Sana'a - Marib, is
estimated at 59% compared with the appraisal estimate (excluding the Sana'a -
Marib road strengthening) of 13%.



8
6.09        The full extent of the environmental impact on the historical and
archaeological monuments of the ancient kingdom of Saba was not foreseen at
appraisal. The completiwn of the new Marib Dam and increased agriculture in
the area have further affected the archaeological environment. The cultural
landscape with all its material relics - hydraulic work systems, temples,
palaces, settlements, canals, and areas of cultivable land for agriculture -
has been impacted. However, the implementation of steps outlined in para 5.05
have been a mitigating factor in the preservation of the archaeological
landscape.
7.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.01        In view of the higher level of traffic than that forecast at
appraisal, the sustainability of the project hinges on two factors: (a) the
increased road maintenance effort required: in this connection, HA has set up
a permanent maintenance workshop in Marib for the maintenance of all project
roads, with appropriate budgetary allocations; and (b) the implementation of
the "Marib Master Plan" for safeguarding the Sabaean monuments (para. 5.05).
7.02        The main objective of the Marib Master Plan is the design of an
archaeological park for the preservation of the monuments and for their
touristic exploitation. The park will provide the appropriate setting for the
archaeological remains, including basic infrastructure and services, e.g., a
museum, fencing of the area, walkways, restaurant for visitors, etc. Special
vegetation, suitable to the desertic environment of the area, planted in and
around the park will provide beautification and stabilization of sand dunes,
and arrest further advancement of the desert. The agricultural development in
the area has caused some damage to the Sabaean monuments. Further degradation
to the archaeological remains can be anticipated, particularly in the network
of canals of the Sabaean irrigation system. If the execution of the "Marib
Master Plan" is not undertaken by the Government as a matter of priority.
8.    IDA Performance
8.01        IDA displayed flexibility and responsiveness when it allowed the
project to proceed under force account subject to the employment of an
independent consultant to supervise the road-works and ICB procedures for
procurement of materials. The successful implementation of the project
justified the IDA action: howev.r, it should be borne in mind that it is
necessary (i) that normal contract procedures are adhered to with an
owner/contractor relationship (para. 4.04); and (ii) to ascertain that the
tender price accurately reflects the total costs of the works.
8.02        During implementation, IDA responded promptly to requests from the
Government to reallocate cost savings to carry out additional works (para
5.03) complementary to the original objectives established at appraisal report
(para 3.01). Project supervision was timely and staff continuity was ensured
during all stages of the project implementation.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
MARIB-SAFIR ROAD PROJECT
(CREDIT 1726-YAR)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Proiect Identity
Project Name:     Marib-Safir Road Project
Credit Number:    1726-YAR
RVP Unit:         EMENA Region, Country Department III
Country:          Republic of Yemen (Formerly Northern Governorate:
Yemen Arab Republic)
Sector:           Transport
Subsector:        Highways
2.    Proiect Background
2.01        The Republic of Yemen (ROY) occupies an area (537,000 sq. km) of
largely mountainous terrain in the northern region, and a desertic area in the
southern and eastern regions with a widely dispersed population of about 11.5
million people (1990). As a consequence of this setting, both the demand for
transport and cost of providing transport services are high. Until about 1960
ROY lacked a modern transport system. Land transport was essentially over
primitive tracks, port facilities were limited to the ports of Aden and Mocha,
and there was no air service within the country. Progress started following
the end of the civil war in 1972. The fast pace of economic development in
neighbouring countries in the 1970s provided employment opportunities for
Yemeni workers and absorbed about 30% of the Yemeni work force.
2.02        The resulting increases in workers' remittances fuelled an
economic boom in Yemen, particularly in the transport sector. The main
factors which contributed to this upsurge in transport demand were: (i)
financial support from the migrant labor force to build transport links to
their villages; (ii) increasing migration of rural people to urban areas while
maintaining close ties to their villages; (iii) structural changes in the
pattern ard level of consumption requiring much larger imports; and (iv) an
ambitious development program spurring construction activities in various
sectors on a massive scale.
2.03        Traffic on all modes grew at unprecedented levels during the
1970s, but decreased during the 1980s to more normal levels due to a decline
in workers' remittances caused by the recession in the Gulf States and general
slowdown in economic activities. During the last 20 years. ROY has built up
the framework of a modern transport system consisting of about 6,500 km of
main roads (4,500 km paved), two modern sea ports at Aden and Hodeidah, four
seconda.ry ports, five international airports and internal air services. Yemen
does not have a rail system and is totally dependent on roads for surface
transportation.



2
2.04        Because of the discovery of oil in 1984 and construction of a
10,000 bbd refinery (30% of Yemen's consumption) at the oil wells site
(Safir), construction of this road connecting Safir with the paved road
network at Marib became of high priority. The project was fully responsive to
the transport sector and macro-economic policy objectives, including foreign
exchange earnings and savings and tourism promotion.
3.    Project Obiectives and Components
3.01        Proiect Obiectives:  The original objectives of the project were
to facilitate the following:
(i)   the substitution of domestic oil for imported products by
permitting the transport of white products from a refinery at the
oil field at Safir to domestic markets;
(ii)  further development of the oil fields;
(iii) road access that would enable the movement of agricultural inputs
and the marketing of agricultural products to the Wadi As Sudd
area; and
(iv)  increase the capability of the Highway Authority (HA) to design
road works.
3.02        Proiect Components:  The project, implemented over the period
1987-1990, included:
(i)   completion to paved standard of a new road from Marib to Safir
(62.5 km) which was being constructed to gravel standard (sub
base) by HA force account with government financing; and
(ii)  the supervision of construction by consultants.
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        The project --s appraised in November 1985.  The HA played an
important role in the prep.ration of the project as a result of the maturity
it had reached, through previous IDA projects.  The HA prepared the
feasibility study and detailed engineering design documents for the project.
Six different itineraries were studied and compared in order to (i) achieve
optimal integration of and service to the nearly 100,000 people settled at the
border of the desert along the first 35 km of the road, and (ii) avoid as much
as possible the shifting sand dunes in the last section of the road. All the
soil tests were carried out at the HA laboratory (supervised by consultants
and IDA), partly financed under the Third Highway Project (Credit 794-YAR).
The design concepts underlying the individual components were appropriate at
the time of identification, preparation, appraisal and execution.
4.02        The HA started constructing the first phase of the road by force



3
account to gravel (20 cm sub-base) standard using ite own funds for
construction and those from Credit 1413-YAR, for supervision of works by
consultants. It lacked funds to complete the road to asphalt standard and
proposed to complete the road (base, shoulders and wearing course) to paved
standard with IDA financing, also with force account, under the proposed
project. The reasons for this exceptional proposal were:
(i)   HA was satisfactorily constructing the
road to sub-base standard by force
account. To complete the road to asphalt
standard by a contractor would have
delayed construction by about 9 months
(the duration of the ICB procurement
process) and could have increased the cost
of mobilization and maintenance, thus
resulting in a loss of expected vehicle
operating cost savings, and lack of clear
accountability when a contractor completes
work begun by others; and
(ii) the tribal nature of a remote area where a
private contractor would have experienced
difficulties on issues related to use of
land and water because local tribes have
jurisdiction over land and water rights.
HA had already secured the necessary land
and water for its operation which a new
contractor may not be able to do.
4.03        During negotiations in May 1986, the Yemeni delegation reiterated
its request to complete construction of the Marib-Safir Road by force account
rather than by a contractor selected under international competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures.   Given the above mentioned circumstances, IDA's agreement
to a combination of ICB for procurement of construction materials (bitumen)
and force account for the execution of works was given on an exceptional basis
and was not to be viewed as a precedent.
4.04        The Central Planning Organization (CPO) was the client
representing the Government with the overall responsibility for supervision of
the works, and HA was the contractor. The CPO then employed a foreign
consulting firm to supervise the actual construction work. A separate
agreement was drawn between CPO and HA to assure that the force account works
would be carried out to agreed standards, to approve disbursements with the
assistance of foreign con. ltantci, and to monitor project costs. A special
account was opened in the Central Bank of Yemen to be used exclusively for
financing IDA's share of expenditures (55% of works expenditure and 100% of
foreign expenditure for goods and consultant services) under the Credit
Agreement.



4
5.    Proiect Imnlementation
5.01        The project was originally scheduled to be completed in June 1989
after a two-year implementation period. IDA's decision to finance force
account operations had a very positive impact on project implementation. The
immediate commencement of works and the lower unit prices of HA compared to
the prevailing international prices resulted in cost savings estimated at SDR
1.8 million. Works were of excellent quality and were completed in March
1988, nine months ahead of the estimated completion date at appraisal report.
5.02        The Government requested IDA agreement for the use of the
uncommitted funds of SDR 1.8 million, otherwise to be cancelled, inter alia,
for the overlay of portions of the Marib-Sana'a (170 km) road, the only
asphalted link of the project area with the rest of the country. The road
constructed for light traffic in 1982 had been considerably damaged by the
heavy oil traffic, the heavy construction equipment deployed in the Marib-
Safir road works and the traffic generated by the project road. HA prepared a
feasibility and design study which fully justified the overlay. IDA approved
the economic and technical studies for the road. The financing of this
additional component under the Credit was agreed to by IDA and the Credit
Agreement was amended on March 2, 1989.
5.03        This amendment to the completed works provided for the following
enlarged projectt (a) the overlay of a Sana'a-Marib road section (80 km), (b)
construction of a 150-heavy vehicle parking lot at the end of the road at
Safir and of its 200 meter asphalt link to the road, (c) rehabilitation and
asphalting of the secondary road connecting the Marib-Safir road with the old
(monument) and new dams of Marib(10 km) and its 50-vehicle parking lot, (d)
construction of a 1 km access road to the Sabasan Awwan (Bilqis) temple and a
25 vehicle parking lot, (e) acquisition of two vehicles for vigilance of the
archaeological area of Marib, and (f) the preparation of an Archeological
Master Plan drawn up by consultants, the General Organization of Antiquities
and Libraries (GOAL), and the German Archaeological Institute (GAI).
5.04        During the early stages of the project implementation, it was
recognized that the road network threads through the historical monuments
which extend to an area of about 15 sq. km around Marib, the capital of the
ancient kingdom of Saba. The Sabaean monuments which were partially buried
under the sand dunes for over 2,000 years are an archaeological treasure house
of international importance. Their preservation is a matter of some concern
amongst archaeological interest groups around the world. Because of
increasing traffic and ease of access resulting from the road, these
archaeological sites became more vulnerable to damage. Without appropriate
protective measures, an increase in the rate of damage was anticipated.
5.05        IDA saw this as an opportunity to assist the Government of YAR in
putting into effect a program for safeguarding the historic and archaeological
sites. An IDA supervision mission approached GOAL in Yemen to prepare an
Action Plan. The steps outlined in paras 5.03 (c) to (e) were part of an
'Action Plan for Safeguarding of the Sabaean Monuments". An investment of US$
200,000 was provided under the Credit towards the implementation of the Action



5
Plan, which included fencing of a few monuments, a storage facil'ty for
agchaeological remains, purchase of two vehicles for a team of four policemen,
and most importantly, the preparation of "Master Plan Marib" (para. 7.02).
6.    Proiect Results and Economic Re-evaluation
6.01        Overall, the project was successful in meeting the principal
objectives of facilitating transport of oil products from the refinery to
domestic markets, marketing of agricultural products to the Wadi As Sudd area.
It has opened the Rub Al Khali (Empty Quarter) desert area to systematic oil
exploration and agricultural development. In addition it has promoted savings
in foreign exchange due to reduced imports of refined oil. It has also
provided greater integration of this remote area with the rest of the country.
The capability of HA to design and construct road works has been vastly
enhanced as a result of its participation in this project.
6.02        The project had a very positive impact on the economic development
of the eastern region which includes the western border of the Rub Al Khali
(Empty Quarter) desert. At least 14,000 hectares of added land have been
brought under cultivation due to the accessibility provided by the new road
network to the new dam and wells. The road has facilitated movement of
agricultural produce and fruits to the markets. Two new hotels have come up
since the completion of the project. There is tourist traffic of over 150
persons a day in the area whare there were none five years ago.
6.03        Marib - Safir Road Construction   The SAR is lacking in analysis
and data underlying the estimated IRR of 13% for the upgrading of the Marib -
Safir road. Furthermore, the economic evaluation study undertaken by the
consultants (Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, UK) upon which the project was based
estimated an IRR of nearly 60%. Consequently, it is not possible to prepare a
strictly comparable reevaluation. Nonetheless, with a calculated IRR of 63%
the component was clearly economically rentable. The primary reason for the
difference in the SAR IRR estimate and the recalculated figure was the under-
estimation of the traffic generation effect of the new road (para. 6.04).
6.04        The 1990 traffic count taken at km 20 of this 60.5 km road records
traffic of 1,951 vpd par rapport with the consultant's estimate of 438 vpd;
although the consultant's estimate for heavy vehicles of 370 vpd (50% oil
traffic) was closer to the 1990 actual of 591 vpd. Again, the tremendous
potential impact of the new road and new Marib dam on the region's economic
and social activity was not foreseen. This situation presents a common
dilemma in feasibility studies which is frequently ignored. That is to say, to
assume that the present traffic could have used the original track road with,
consequently, the benefit stream being the difference between operating costs
on the track road and the project road, is clearly unrealistic as, in the
absence of the new road, the growth in traffic would simply not have taken
place. It is probable that the heavy vehicles serving the Safir oil
development could have continued to use the track road and, thus, the
difference in their operating costs is a valid benefit. The majority of the



6
rest of the traffic must be considered as generated traffic and, assuming a
downward sloping demand curve vis a vis operating costs, actual benefits, in a
simplified way, should be calculated as 50% of the vehicle operating cost
savings between the track road and the project road. This approach has been
adopted in the, albeit partial, reevaluation of the rate of return.
Furthermore, it has been assumed that, following the construction of the
pipeline to the coast, the amount of oil trafftc declines substantially after
1990 and that there is a 5% growth rate fo.: other traffic. Consequently, an
order of magnitude stream of costs and benefits (YR million at constant
prices) and resultant economic Irnternal Rate of Return is as follows:
Costs              Benefits                Net Benefits
1988               77.0                                           -77.0
1989                                   63                           63
1990                                   37                           37
1991                                   39                           39
1992                                   41                          41
1993                                   43                           43
1994               13.0                45                          32
1995                                   47                           47
1996                                   50                           50
1997                                   52                           52
1998                                   55                           55
1999                                   57                           57
2000                                   60                           60
Economic Internal Rate of Return:  63%
It is clear, however, that this reevaluation, although demonstrating that the
project was strongly justified, can only be crude in the absence of additional
research. The possibility of carrying out this research as part of one of the
ongoing Bank fin,aiced projects should be discussed with the Government. Not
only would sucs. a study be useful in improving the Project Completion Report
but it would also be of benefit to the Government in developing improved
traffic forecasting which is important in selecting appropriate road designs
and in planning road maintenance. For example, with this considerably higher
level of traffic than was assumed at the time of the road design and
construction, doubts must arise regarding the future life of the road and the
maintenance effort required.
6.05        Sana'a - Marib Road Strenothenina:  The February, 1989 feasibility
study of this additional component of the project was carried out by the staff
of the, then, Highway Authority assisted by technical assistance personnel.
The cost benefit analysis of the 45 km section of road assumed that the
component was basically periodic road maintenance with a conservative life of
5 years - 1990 to 1994. The cost stream included the cost of the overlay and
annual maintenance whilet the benefit stream consisted of vehicle operating
cost savings and savings in road maintenance. The analysis tested three
traffic growth scenarios of 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% and, based on these, the
component yielded economic Internal Rates of Return (IRR) of 41.4%, 46.5% and
42.5% respectively. The lower IRR for the 7.5% growth rate was due to



7
assuming that a thicker overlay would be required thus increasing the
construction cost by 15%.
6.06        In the event, traffic growth over the period 1986 to 1990 for the
whole road has averaged 23.4% p.a. with heavy vehicles increasing at 32.7%
p.a. compared with the feasibility study assumption of 4.8%: for the 45km
section the averaga growth rate was marginally lower at 22.6%. In the two
years 1989 and 1990, the traffic grew at 43% p.a. It is clear that the
feasibility study severely underestimated the impact of the construction of
the Marib - Safir road on the oil traffic and, together with the new Marib
Dam, on the agricultural and tourist traffic traffic of the region. This very
high rate of growth is not expected to continue and, indeed, may fall back to
the national average of between 4% and 5%. However, the high scenario 1990
base figure used in the analysis was only 56% of the actual figure.
Consequently, the benefit stream has been significantly underestimated.
6.07        As regards costs, the final cost is not yet available but will
probably be close to the YR30 million estimate for construction of the 5cm
overlay and annual maintenance costs of YR1 million.  Using these revised
traffic and voc figures we arrive at the following net cash flows (YR millions
at constant prices) and economic IRRa:

Such high rates of return are, of course, not unusual for road maintenance
projects.
6.08        Total Proiect   The total project cost is estimated at YR18O
million of which the two road components, described above, comprised an
estimated YR107 million. The remaining components consisted of supplementary
works in the Marib/Safir region, including (i) access roads to archaeological
sites; (ii) access to the new Marib dam; (iii) parking for oil traffic at
Safir and at archaeological sites; and (iv) technical assistance for the
preparation of a Master Plan for preservation of Sabaen antiquities and
development of an archaeological park: none of these were subjected to
economic evaluation but were clearly environmentally necessary and justified.
The overall Economic IRR for the project, including Sana'a - Marib, is
estimated at 59% compared with the appraisal estimate (excluding the Sana'a -
Marib road strengthening) of 13%.

6.09        The full extent of the environmental impact on the historical and
archaeological monuments of the ancient kingdom of Saba was not foreseen at
appraisal. The completion of the new Marib Dam and increased agriculture in
the area have further affected the archaeological environment. The cultural
landscape with all its material relics - hydraulic work systems, temples,
palaces, settlements, canals, and areas of cultivable land for agriculture -
has been impacted. However, the implementation of steps outlined in para 5.05
have been a mitigating factor in the preservation of the archaeological
landscape.
7.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.01        In view of the higher level of traffic than that forecast at
appraisal, the sustainability of the project hinges on two factors: (a) the
increased road maintenance effort required: in this connection, HA has set up
a permanent maintenance workshop in Marib for the maintenance of all project
roads, with appropriate budgetary allocationts; and (b) the implemaitation of
the "Marib Master Plan" for safeguarding the Sabaean monuments (para. 5.05).
7.02        The main objective of the Marib Master Plan is the design of an
archaeological park for the preservation of the monuments and for their
touristic exploitation. The park will provide the appropriate setting for the
archaeological remains, including basic infrastructure and services, e.g., a
museum, fencing of the area, walkways, restaurant for visitors, etc. Special
vegetation, suitable to the desertic environment of the area, planted in and
around the park will provide beautification and stabilization of sand dunes,
and arrest further advancement of the desert. The agricultural development in
the area has caused some damage to the Sabaean monuments. Further degradation
to the archaeological remains can be anticipated, particularly in the network
of canals of the Sabaean irrigation system. If the execution of the "Marib
Master Plan" is not undertaken by the Government as a matter of priority.
8.    IDA Performance
8.01        IDA displayed flexibility and responsiveness when it allowed the
project to proceed under force account subject to the employment of an
independent consultant to supervise the road-works and ICB procedures for
procurement of materials. The successful implementation of the project
justified the IDA action: however, it should be borne in mind that it is
necessary (i) that normal contract procedures are adhered to with an
owner/contractor relationship (para. 4.04); and (ii) to ascertain that the
tender price accurately reflects the total costs of the works.
8.02        During implementation, IDA responded promptly to requests from the
Government to reallocate cost savings to carry out additional works (para
5.03) complementary to the original objectives established at appraisal report
(para 3.01). Project supervision was timely and staff continuity was ensured
during all stages of the project implementation.



9
8.03        Although the dangers to which the area's archLaeological remains
were exposed by the road construction underline the need to include
environmental impact studies in appraisals (para 5.05), IDA reacted quickly as
soon as these dangers were identified. IDA's success in encouraging the
Government to make a commitment to the preservation of the monuments as a
national heritage as well as a tourisz attraction will serve as a useful case
studj for the benefit of future projects.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01         The Governmont, to a great extent due to the efforts of the
executing Ministry, demonstrated that credit effectiveness can be achieved
within an acceptable time. The credit was declared effective within three
months of signing.
9.02        HA's record as a contractor exceeded expectations in completing
the road and other subsequent works to excellent quality standards, ahead of
time and under budget. The competence and experience of HA in road design,
construction and maintenance were instrumental to the success of the project.
There is little question that, in this case, using an outside contractor would
have involved added mobilization costs and additional implementation time.
The success also owed much to the commitment and energy of the Chairman of
the HA, the Minister of Transport and Public Works. The HA also performed
well in undertaking the feasibility study and design and subsequent overlay
works for the Marib-Sana'a Road: this involved drawing on its stocks of
bit'rmen in order to complete the works in a timely way, and the six month
postponement of the credit closing date was only occasioned by the need to
replace these stocks.
9.03        All covenants concerning Borrower's obligations, including
accounting and audit covenants were met on time. Quarterly progress reports
of a high quality were submitted to IDA regularly.
9.04        Cooperation and coordination of efforts between the HA and the
Goal were less than efficient, although much of this must be put down to
inexperience; nonetheless the outcome has, so far, been satisfactory.
However, in countries where there are likely to be important archaeological
remains and where road construction can be a major threat to these remains, it
may be worth formalizing responsibilities and decision taking among the
different agencies concerned: in Cyprus, for example, the authorities have
gone one stage further by including the Department of Antiquities in the
Ministry of Communications and Works.
10.   Bank - Borrower Relationships
10.01       IDA's relationship with the Government and the implementing agency
on the project has been very good. IDA staff associated with the project were
able to form close and effective relationships with senior officials in the



10
responsible agencies of the Government.
11.   Consulting Services
11.01       The successful implementation of the project, including the
additional components, could not have been attained without the inputs
provided by the consultants throughout the project. A foreign consulting firm
was employed for the construction supervision of the project. Two expatriates
were employed as consultants to supervise the additional overlay work of the
Marib-Sana'a road. Specialist consultants were employed to formulate the
"Action Plan for the Safeguarding of the Sabaean Monuments" and to prepare
"Marib Master Plan". All the project consultants provided excellent services
throughout proje t implementation.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.01       The legal documents, including amendments, were adequate and
clear. The Staff Appraisal Report could have been improved. In particular
(i) whilst recognising that the Marib - Safir Road would pass through an area
of ancient monuments, measures to protect these were not dealt with in a
detailed way (SAR para. 3.22); (ii) the economic evaluation did not provide
adequate supporting data thus, inter alia, making re-evaluation difficult;
(iii) no explanation is given for the rejection of the consultant's
feasibility study of the Marib - Safir Road which, in the event, was more
accurate regarding the project IRR than the SAR; and (iv) the project focus
w-s rather limited in so far as, whilst recognising that the improvement of
the f1arib - Safir Road would lead to traffic increases, no consideration was
given as to the possible impact of this on contiguous road sections such as
Sana'a - Marib.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
MARIB-SAFIR ROAD PROJECT
(CREDIT 1726-YAR)
PART II. _PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1. Comments on Parts I and III.
1.01        The ROY (the Borrower) generally confirms the information provided
and views expressed in Parts I and III of the PCR. However, it would like to
highlight and focus attention on certain aspects which are of considerable
interest and importance to developing countries, in general, and Yemen in
particular.
1.02        The primary objectives of the Project were two-fold: one to
provide for transport of refined oil products from the newly-found oil fields
at Safir to domestic markets; and the other to facilitate the movement of
agricultural products. The Economic Feasibility Report 1/ prepared by a
Consultant of international repute formed the basis for the appraisal of the
Project.
1.03        The traffic census conducted since completion of the Project
indicated that the classical method used by the Consultant for traffic
forecast led to gross underestimation. Compared to the predicted Annual
Average Daily Traffic (AADT) of 710 vehicles/day (including 126 heavy
vehicles) for the year 1990, the actuial numbers were 1,951 (including 625
heavy vehicles). A major reason for this phenomenon was that the road had to
satisfy the latent and hitherto unsatisfied demand in this far-flung area.
1.04        Para 6.03, Part I of the PCR states that the economic rate of
return for the Project is now estimated to be 59X compared to the appraisal
stage estimate of 13Z, both based on tangible benefits arising from savings in
vehicle operating costs. However, the Project has brovght in considerable
benefits usually considered intangible in prior studies. Some of these are:
-     reclamation and bringing to farming of over 14.000 hectares
of dune-infested area and stabilization of sand dunes.
This, besides bringing in economic prosperity for the
people, has provided a major positive impact on the
environment.
-     increased agricultural production, employment and land
values.
-     integration of the people in the far-flung area in the
mainstream of the society.
j/./ Marib-Safir Road Economic Feasibility Study Final Report.



12
If these benefits are evaluated and accounted, the economic rate of return
would be much higher. Thus, the Project has shown up itself as a classical
example for roads in hitherto unconnected areas in developing countries.
1.05        The traffic explosion has brought in its own implication on the
life of the projeAt road. The Consultant estimated the equivalent standard
axles (ESA) to be 386,000 per year from 1989 onwards. Though 7cm-thick
asphaltic concrete surfacing was recommended, this was reduced to 4 cm at the
appraisal stage. It was estimated that the pavement would be able to carry a
cumulated ESA of 7.5 million. The actual happening has been drastically
different. The traffic census for three years since opening to traffic showed
the following daily fluw of heavy trucks:
Trucks Per day (both directions)2/
Year                2/6     3/10      4/14     5/18      6/22    ESA3/ (million)
1988                25      203        -
20      2          1.51
1989                42      148        8        31        10          1.56
1990               211      221       20        86        87          4.33
Though the traffic flow figures for 1990 were exceptional, it is reasonable to
assume an annual ESA of 2 million for 1990 onwards. This will mean that the
fatigue life of the pavement will be consumed by the year 1992 itself. A
strengthening overlay has, therefore, become imperative and urgent to
safeguard the investments already made on the road.
1.06        At present hair cracks have started showing up in certain
stretches, and these are being promptly sealed by the special maintenance set-
up at Marib. Yet the riding quality continues to be good to very good,
basically oecause of the very high quality of initial construction.
2.  Evaluation of Bank's Berformance in the Proiect
2.01        The Bank's approval of the construction of the road by the HA on
force account, rather than calling tenders on ICB basis, resulted in a
positive impact on the execution of the project. The Bank's flexibility for
this exceptional arrangement made it possible for the early commencement of
the works, besides savings in cost, as a result of the efficient performance
and the lower unit prices of HA. Successful implementation of the project on
force account basis has brought into sharp focus that this method should be
considered as a positive tool rather than an exception, particularly when the
2/./ Census conducted by HA at km 20 for 5 days each year.
3/./ Calculated on the assumption of 13T for all axles except for the front
which has been ignored. The TRRL formula with 4.5 for the irdex has
been adopted for finding axle equivalency factors.



13
construction agency is well mobilized, and has a motivated work force and a
committed management. Besides cost and time savings, the project had several
spin-offs by way of inculcating confidence and self-reliance, aspects so dear
to developing countries.
2.02        It is -ratifying to record that during implementation the Bank
promptly responded to the Government's request for the inclusion of the
additional works against the savings in the credit proceeds. These works have
been of considerable importance to the country by way of improvements to the
road connecting Sana'a and Marib, enhancement of tourist interests and
protection to the archaeological remains of the area.
2.03        The Bank staff played an important role throughout the
construction and follow-up stages and contributed towards maintaining a close
relationship between the Government and the Bank. They were also very helpful
at all stages, and, in particular, mention should be made of the assistance
rendered by them in the preparation and monitoring of the project.
3. Evaluation of Borrower's Performance in the Proiect
3.01        It was the first time that a major asphalt road, the project road,
was constructed in the far-flung and dune-infested desert area in the country.
Yet, HA showed its mettle in the choice of appropriate alignment, field
surveys, and in the preparation of designs and drawings. During all the
phases of the project, HA performed professionally and completed the works to
high standards to the full satisfaction of the Government and the Bank. For
the Government in general and HA in particular, spin offs from the project
have been many. Notable among them is that the HA has been able to develop a
confident, committed and well trained band of Yemeni Engineers, technicians
and operators for the design and construction of major road projects to the
best international standards. They have already shown their capability in the
successful completion of the 56km long Fardah-Al Hazm road to asphalt
standards well ahead of the time schedule.
3.02        The Central Planning Organization (CPO) was the agency
representing the Government of ROY. Close coordination with the Bank and
management through objectives by the CPO allowed for smooth progress and
timely completion of the project. The outstanding contribution made by H. E.
the Minister of Transport and Public Works, who was also Chairman of HA,
through his deep commitment, guidance and close personal attention through all
stages of the project, requires no mention.
4. Assessment of Bank/Borrower Relationship during the Proiect.
4.01        Relationship between the Bank, on one hand, and the Government and
the HA on the other, had been extremely cordial and purposeful. The Bank
staff associated with the project were able to play a major useful and
effective role by forgoing a close and effective working relationship with the
Minister of Transport and Public Works and the concerned key personnel of CPO
and HA.

Yemeni staff, whether through the Vocational Training Center at Taiz or through
overseas fellowships. The successful implementation of the project by force account
is mainly due to 4he competence of this staff.

Commer.te:
The goods (bitumen) required for the completion of works in the enlarged project
(mainly in the Sana'a-Marib road overlay works) were delivered six months after
completion of works, i.e., 12/31/90 against 06/30/90, because of problems in the
Saudi ports. The works were completed with bitumen borrowed from the HA general
stock. Once the bitumen was received in Hodeidah, it replaced the bitumen
previously borrowed from HA stock.

Comments:
The only amendment to the Development Credit Agreement (March 2, 1989) was based on
the inclusion of the Marib - Sana'a Road overlay works in the enlarged project.
This road was not part of the description of the original project. However, the
impact of the project on this road (built in 1982 for light traffic) with the heavy
oil traffic was very damaging. The Government requested and IDA management agreed
(telex of March 2, 1989) on financing the strengthening of the road with available
funds under the project.

Marib-Sana'a Road La           n/a                                183%
Comnmentfs:
LI   The Staff Appraisal Report was very conservative on the estimation of the
economic return of the Marib-Safir road. The increases in traffic and economic
activity have been considerably higher than estimated because of (a) the high
success of the exploitation of the discovered oil wells; (b) increased production of
the refinery; (c) further exploration with successful discovery of oll and gas
wells; (d) stronger than expected agricultural development; (e) increase of
population of Marib area due to the attraction of economic development; and (f)
significant increase of military units in the area.
La   Economic returns higher than 100% are quite common on the
rehabilitation/upgrading of roads that otherwise would be destroyed by heavy
traffic. The important savings on Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) to the heavy
traffic is the main reason for the high economic return in the overlay and
rehabilitation of the Marib-Sana'a road.

Comments:
All the covenants related to the execution of the project as defined in Articles III
and IV of the Development Credit Agreement were fully complied with. No issue on
procurement of goods arose during the implementation of the project. All the
consultant. required by the project were selected after IDAs review and approval of
proposals. One additional agreement not included in the Development Credit
Agreement, the timely preparation of "Marib Master Plan", was also complied with.
