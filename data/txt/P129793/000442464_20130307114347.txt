1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Political context: At appraisal of the GPR series the internal political and social situation had
been relatively stable since 1999 under the leadership of President Mamadou Tandja. Local
elections were scheduled for March 2009 to be followed by legislative and presidential elections
by end 2009. The program document indicates that these two events would test the strength of
Niger’s democratic institutions. Increased spending that would undermine hard earned
macroeconomic stability of recent years was considered to be the main risk arising from the
forthcoming elections. The program document also notes that while the situation had
significantly improved in that decade, the country still faced recurrent rebellions in the
Northwestern mineral rich region.

Economic context: According to United Nations Development Program’s Human Development
Report, Niger ranked 174 out of 177 countries on its Human Development Index with a Gross
Domestic Product per capita in purchasing power parity terms equal to US$780, one of the
lowest in the world. Nevertheless, since 2000 there had been improvements in both economic
and social indicators. Despite periodic setbacks due to droughts, locust invasions, and avian flu,
growth had slowly been gathering momentum. Average per capita GDP growth had been
positive since 2000, marking an encouraging shift from falling per capita GDP during the 1990s.
Donor support under debt relief initiatives had contributed to this improved performance.
However, Niger’s financial sector and Niger’s private sector base remained among the smallest
and least developed ones in the region. Most of Niger’s growth potential was associated with the
oil and mining sector, and with regional trade in the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) and with Nigeria. While most countries in Africa were experiencing a
slowdown in mining and oil and gas related investments, this was not the case in Niger, where
these investments had been initiated and largely implemented before mid- 2008. The downturn in
food and oil prices benefited Niger’s economy as it was a net importer of both. Its non-mining
exports (live animals, onions and cowpeas) were sold in the regional markets and were therefore
not directly affected by the global decline in demand. Overall, it was expected that the ripple
effects of the on-going global financial crisis and recession would be moderate in Niger.

The Government’s fiscal position had been fairly stable with the deficit easily covered by
external financing. Niger had not resorted to domestic bank financing in the four years
preceding appraisal and had been able to build up its net international reserves to exceed five
months. There was some decline in external donor financing between 2006 and 2008 that was
offset by greater domestic fiscal revenues, mostly from agreements with the French mining
company AREVA on investment in uranium mining and from the US$300 million signature
bonus for the oil extraction and refinery building contract with a subsidiary of the China National
Petroleum Corporation. The external current account deficit, excluding grants, had been stable as
a proportion of GDP at around 11 percent through 2007. In 2008 it widened to 12.3 percent of
GDP, due to higher capital imports by extractive industries and increased prices of food and oil
imports.




                                                                                                12
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Growth Policy Reform series was initially envisaged to consist of two programmatic
development policy operations (GPRG-1 and GPRC-2) that would be disbursed over two years
and focus on growth of the productive sectors. The GPRG-1 was a grant and GPRC-2 a credit.
The main objectives of the GPR series were to help overcome policy constraints and institutional
bottlenecks to growth by (i) addressing the main business environment obstacles, including
taxes; (ii) relieving infrastructure constraints for the private sector; (iii) promoting rural sector
growth; (iv) pursuing public finance management reform; and (v) addressing demographic
issues.

The main expected outcome of the series was higher private investment and job creation through
improving the business climate. More specifically, the two DPOs were expected to bring about:
(i) an improved business environment, freeing up financing for short term capital needs, and
increased access to finance; (ii) improved road infrastructure; increased private sector
participation in public infrastructure projects; (iii) a better performing agricultural sector, through
food imports rationalization and technology investment; (iv) improved public financial
management by: (a) enhancing the linkages between budget and treasury functions which will
directly translate in the reduction of payment delays to private suppliers, (b) strengthening the
financial relationship between the State and the private sector, (c) encouraging an increase in
registered tax-paying firms by lowering the profit tax, (d) and bolstering financing for
infrastructure maintenance; and (v) the implementation of the government’s policy on
demographics.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The objectives of the operation were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Policy area 1: Promote Private Sector Growth

The GPR series sought to support the Government’s efforts in promoting private sector-led
growth and entry into the formal sector by: (i) reducing the corporate income tax from 35 percent
to 30 percent, as a first step towards comprehensive tax reforms, broadening of the tax base, and
overhaul of incentives to ensure a level playing field for private firms; (ii) accelerating and
completing the repayment process of all internal debt arrears due to the private sector,
completing a process launched in the early 2000s; (iii) completing the setup of FINAPOSTE
through its capitalization.

Policy area 2: Address Infrastructure Constraints for Private Sector Growth

GPRG-1 focused on two policy areas in infrastructure that have direct and indirect impact on
private sector and rural growth: the quality of roads and service delivery by the infrastructure
sectors including the energy and water/irrigation sub-sectors.

Policy area 3: Support Agricultural Sector and Rural Development as the Main Generator of
Employment

                                                                                                    13
The GPR series supported the reform of agriculture sector institutions with the objective of
improving access, cost effectiveness, and quality of agricultural inputs and extension services.
The program entailed reforms that would (i) improve the efficiency of the input marketing
system by allowing farmers to have access to inputs at better prices and (ii) support the
modernization of agricultural services.

Policy area 4: Address Public Finance Constraints

The GPR series supported reform program in this area included (i) the introduction of electronic
processing of payables to private suppliers,(ii) the improvement of transparency and procurement
controls by the revision of the decrees 113/10/06 and 114/10/06 on conflict of interest and
control of contracts awards and (iii) the preparation /disclosure of the 2010 Budget Law in
accordance with the provisions of the organic law no. 2003-011 dated April 1, 2003 and it
contains a functional and economic presentation. In the next step, the support focused (i) on
increasing pro-poor expenditures by at least one percentage point of the Gross Domestic Product
in the 2011 budget compared to the second revised budget of 2010 and (ii) submission to the
National Assembly of a bill for the adoption of a new procurement code that is consistent with
the WAEMU directives.

Policy areas 5: Demographics

The focus of reforms in this area was to ensure that the institutional set-up for the
implementation of the Government Declaration of Population Policy (DGPP) was made effective
at the national, regional, departmental, and communal levels.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

While the policy areas supported by the GPR series were maintained, the fact that Niger was
ruled by a military transition government between February 2011 and April 2012 required some
adjustments to the specific reforms implemented under GPRC-2: In particular, the transition
government (i) adopted a revised strategy for financial sector reform which was consistent with
Bank advice; (ii) considered that reforms of the pension system and public-private partnership
required a broader political consensus, whose attainment was outside the priorities and
possibilities of the transition government, and (iii) insisted on evaluating the full impact of fiscal
reforms before proceeding with further reforms. Consistent with the transition government’s
focus on strengthening public financial management, the adoption of a new General Tax Code
and an increase in pro-poor spending were introduced as new reform measures monitored under
GPRC-2.

1.6 Other significant changes

While it was initially envisaged that the GPR series would be implemented over a period of two
years, the political crisis erupting after Board approval of GPRG-1 in March 2009 resulted in
significant delays in the effectiveness of GPRG-1(May 2010) and in the Board approval of
GPRC-2 (June 2011). Severe external shocks in the form of spillovers from conflict in Libya
and another food crisis in 2012 generated an unanticipated financing gap and required the
preparation of a supplemental financing operation to GPRC-2.


                                                                                                   14
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

The GPR series consisted of two operations: GPRG-1 of SDR 26.5 approved on March 24, 2009
and GRPRC-2 of SDR 32 million approved on June 23, 2011. In order to help Niger sustain the
implementation of the reforms supported by GPRC-2 in the context of unanticipated additional
financing needs due to the adverse impact of the Libyan crisis and a poor harvest in 2011/2012,
the Bank approved a supplemental financing GPRC-2of SDR 9.8 million on February 23, 2012.
GPRG-1 closed on June 30,210 and GPRC-2 and the supplemental financial financing operation
on June 30, 2011.

All prior actions listed in Table 2 were met by the time of Board approval and the three
operations were fully disbursed before the closing dates. Despite the political crisis and changes
in government, the program was effective in supporting the reforms favorable to the private
sector promotion and PFM improvement in Niger.

  The initial program had foreseen the capitalization of FINAPOSTE to ensure the country wide provision of
financial. This was indeed the second best option presented in the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP report) and chosen by the government at the time of preparation of the GPR series. The transition
government reviewed the financial implications of recapitalizing FINAPOSTE and decided to adopt the first best
option proposed in the FSAP report, namely to forego the establishment of FINAPOSTE and to seek to ensure the
provision of countrywide financial services through partnerships between the Nigerien Post Office and private sector
operators.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Political context: In an effort to circumvent term limits and broaden his power, President Tandja
suspended the constitution and implemented emergency rule during May-June 2009. He
dismissed a Constitutional Court ruling that concluded that he could not use a referendum to
change the constitution and remove constitutional term limits, and also dissolved the Parliament.
Voters endorsed Mr. Tandja's new constitution in a referendum in August 2009, which would
have allowed him to remain in office for three more years with additional powers. The
opposition boycotted the referendum, as well as the parliamentary elections in October, which
the candidates supported by Mr. Tandja won handily. The President’s actions to subvert
constitutional rule were widely criticized by the international community. The political crisis
resulted in the withholding of donor support and severe macroeconomic uncertainty, which also
prevented IDA from declaring GPRG-1 effective.

The military assumed power on February 18, 2010, with the stated objective of returning the
country to constitutional rule. The coup d’état occurred with no major disruptions in the daily life
of the people of Niger. Following the coup and until April 7, 2011, Niger was governed by the
Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy led by Army General Djibo Salou. The
transitional authorities put in place a credible and technocratic Government. The coup d’état
triggered the Bank’s O.P 7.30 on dealings with de facto governments. Based on the findings of a
mission that reviewed the situation in Niger in the context of O.P. 7.30 in April 2010, the
Regional Vice President authorized that the necessary steps for declaring GPRG-1 effective be
taken. GPRG-1 was declared effective on May 3, 2010. A joint Bank/IMF/EU mission took
place in June 2010 during which the transition government reconfirmed its commitment to
continue with the implementation of the GPR supported reform program with some adjustments
to GPRC-2, as described above.

Local elections were held on January 8, 2011, legislative elections and the first round of
Presidential elections took place on January 31, 2011. The Nigerien Party for Democracy and
Socialism (PNDS) emerged as the strongest party in the legislative elections. The second round
of Presidential elections was held on March 12, 2011 and Mahamadou Issoufou of the PNDS
was elected President, obtaining more than 57 percent of the votes. The new National Assembly
was installed on March 31, 2011 and the President sworn in on April 7, 2011. A GPRC-2
appraisal mission visited Niamey starting April 27, 2011 to confirm the new government’s
commitment to the GPR supported reform program, assess the completion of the outstanding
prior actions, and negotiate the credit.

External shocks: The implementation period was also characterized by severe external shocks
that have affected the economic, social and security situation of the country. First, poor harvests
in 2009 and 2011 led to severe food crises and high levels of food insecurity. GDP growth
dropped to minus 0.9 percent in 2009 and to 2.3 percent in 2011. Armed conflicts in neighboring
countries– Libya, Mali, and Nigeria-have led to a proliferation of arms in the sub-region and
increased insecurity and terrorist activities. These conflicts have resulted in the return of between
100,000 and 200,000 Nigerien migrant workers from Libya. Managing these shocks in a
situation of political transition claimed much of government’s attention and put additional stress
on Niger’s weak basic service delivery systems. The conflict in Libya also resulted in a
disruption of trade, aid, investment and remittances between Libya and Niger. Dealing with the

                                                                                                  17
large number of returning migrant workers, the food crises, and increased security threats
required increased government spending in these areas, crowding out spending in other areas.
The international community also provided significant support in 2010 and in 2012 to help Niger
deal with these crises.

Capacity: Weak human and institutional capacities represent a significant constraint to the
implementation of reforms in Niger. The problem has been identified by the GPR series as a
significant risk. The political crisis and transition, which resulted in significant turnover of
senior level staff and the management of the external shocks, which claimed significant attention
by government’s senior staff, further accentuated capacity constraints during the implementation
of the GPR supported reform program.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

Successive governments remained committed to the implementation of the GPR supported
reform program and to maintaining macro-economic stability. However, the military transition
government focused on (i) improving the political and economic system, (ii) achieving
reconciliation among Nigeriens, and (iii) returning the country to democracy. While this entailed
an acceleration of public financial management reforms, reforms of the pension system and
promotion of public-private partnerships were considered to be outside the main priorities of the
transition government and preferably implemented by a government with full democratic
legitimacy. The need to maintain social stability in an environment of high political and security
tensions required an approach that seeks consensus, which sometimes resulted in slower than
expected implementation of reforms. In particular, the elimination of large fuel subsidies that
arose from the delinking of domestic pump and international oil prices in the run-up to the 2009
elections proved difficult. A gradual approach of increasing domestic fuel prices was adopted by
the transition government and sustained by the new, democratically elected government,
resulting in the elimination of fuel subsidies by the end of 2012.

Soundness of Background Analysis

The preparation of the credit was grounded in a relatively rich set of analytical work covering
most aspects of the operation, firsthand knowledge from sectoral investment engagement, and
the experienced gained in previous operations. Key analytical work included a Core Welfare
Indicators Questionnaire survey (CWIQ) 2005, a Household Budget Survey (2007/08), an
Investment Climate Assessment (2006), a Country Economic Memorandum (2007), a Diagnostic
Trade Integration Study (Modernizing Trade during a Mining Boom) (2007), annual Doing
Business surveys, and a Financial Sector Assessment (2008). Public Expenditure Management
and Financial Accountability Reviews (PEMFARs) prepared in 2004 and 2008, and a Public
Expenditure Financial Assessment – PEFA issued in December 2008 gave a comprehensive
assessment of the public expenditure management systems. The Country Procurement
Assessment and the 2006 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) provided the underpinnings
for procurement and demographic reforms. In retrospect, the available knowledge was adequate
to identify and prioritize reforms. However, in some areas, such as tax reform and the reduction
of the business income tax, the underlying analysis may not have been comprehensive enough to
allow a full appreciation of the economic and social impacts of the measure. Additional Poverty
and Social Impact Assessment could have helped to provide more comprehensive assessments of

                                                                                               18
the expected impacts. In the case of the reform of the business income tax, such work is
currently underway.

The social and environmental aspects of the GPR series were adequately analyzed. The poverty
assessment based on the 2007/2008 household survey provided an update of the poverty profile
that highlighted the need to increase access of the poor to public services notably in the rural
areas where depth and severity of poverty are all high. The GPR series supported increased pro-
poor expenditures and emphasized improved transparency, accountability, and strengthened
budget execution as well as the links between public spending and the priorities of the
Government’s poverty reduction strategy.

Relevance of Risk Analysis

The GPR series outlined adequately the substantial political, macroeconomic and fiscal risks, as
well as the issues of institutional capacity and fiduciary risk facing the country, and ways to
mitigate them. The political risk had been associated with the organization of elections that could
lead to increased spending that would undermine hard earned macroeconomic stability of recent
years. Macroeconomic and fiscal risks were also related to fuel subsidies, vulnerability to
external shocks (drought, price and exchange rate fluctuations), and Dutch disease effects from a
growing mining sector and aid inflows. Slowing reform program and weak human and
institutional capacities were identified as posing further risks to the achievement of the GPR
objectives.

However: (i) the security risk associated with the instability of neighboring countries had not
been identified as at that time it was difficult to foresee the emergence, scale, and scope of
conflict in Libya, Nigeria and Mali; and (ii) the political risk as interruption of the democratic
system was not considered (maybe because it was identified in the CAS).

Mitigation of the political risks consisted in involving the parties who feel aggrieved into the
political process, including having them participate in the design and implementation of the
policies that affect them. Regarding capacity issues, the main action proposed by the country
team consisted in engaging proactively with the authorities to support them in the design and
implementation of their emerging reform program and provide necessary facts and policy
analysis. The link between the GPR series and the Bank investment projects in the areas of
supported reforms was identified as an opportunity to provide technical assistance to the client.
In retrospect, technical assistance provided by the Bank and by other development partners to the
implementation of GPR supported reforms was essential and broadly adequate to overcome
capacity weaknesses. The propositions to mitigate macroeconomic and fiscal risks were focused
on the policy dialogue of the World Bank and the IMF with the authorities to assist Government
in taking appropriate measures to ensure an appropriate macro-economic environment for the
GPR supported reform program. The dialogue contributed, inter alia, to the adoption of
measures to eliminate fuel subsidies and the preparation of a realistic budget for 2012. Budget
support by IDA and other development partners provided also important incentives to the
authorities to carry out reforms and implement the development program laid out in PRSP-II




                                                                                                19
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. An inter-ministerial steering committee was charged with monitoring outputs and
outcomes and ensuring that remedial actions were implemented in time to avoid slippage.
Monitoring and evaluation of the GPR supported reform program relied primarily on existing
Government processes. The Government had designed an M&E framework to monitor and
evaluate the implementation of its PRSP. Annual PRSP progress reports, prepared by the
permanent PRSP secretariat in the Prime Minister’s Office, are the Government’s main tool for
monitoring overall progress in the implementation of the PRSP-II. A first annual progress report
was prepared in 2010 and a mid-term review report in 2012.

M&E implementation and utilization: In the context of the dramatic political changes that
took place during the implementation of the GPR series, the Ministry of Economy and Finance
ensured continuity in the overall coordination of program implementation and in overseeing
progress in achieving program objectives. In this context, the inter-ministerial steering
committee played a lesser role, but at key stages of the program the Prime Minister and the
Council of Minister’s played important roles in ensuring progress in program implementation
and the completion of prior actions. Monitoring the implementation of reforms drew mainly on
existing processes: (i) the dialogue and monitoring of public financial management took place in
the context of the established government-development partner dialogue, including through the
PEMFAR steering and technical committees, (ii) monitoring of agriculture sector reforms took
place in the context of the framework for the implementation and monitoring of the rural
development strategy as well as the implementation support to the Bank’s rural development
portfolio in Niger, (iii) monitoring of reforms aimed at strengthening road maintenance took
place through regular reports prepared by the Autonomous Road Maintenance Fund (CAFER),
(iv) reforms related to the business environment were monitored by the annual Doing Business
reports, (v) fiscal reforms were monitored in close collaboration with the IMF program review,
(vi) reforms related to demographic issues were monitored through the implementation of the
action plan of Government’s Declaration on Population Policy (DGPP).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

A new programmatic “Shared Growth? DPO series consisting of three operations has been
prepared and broadly maintains the focus of the GPR series. The first operation in the new series
was approved by the Board on June 23, 2012 and the second operation is currently under
preparation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The focus of the GPR series on removing obstacles to private sector growth and on enhancing
public financial management was highly relevant and addressed Niger’s key development
challenges. The GPR objectives were fully aligned with and supportive of the government PRSP
and the CAS. The relevance of the GPR supported reform program and objectives is confirmed
by Niger’s new PRSP (Plan for Economic and Social Development 2012 to 2015) which has as
its overarching objective to achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth.

                                                                                              20
The design of the GPR operations followed established good practice principles in policy-based
lending. Prior Actions (as conditions of disbursement) were few and were relevant to the
achievement of agreed results. The adoption of a programmatic approach proved helpful in
sustaining policy dialogue and reforms in an environment of dramatic political change.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The achievement of GPR development objectives is moderately satisfactory. Despite the difficult
political, economic, and social context, the authorities made substantial efforts to undertake
reforms in order to remove constraints to private sector growth, to promote rural sector growth
and to strengthen public financial management. The macroeconomic framework was stable.

Promote Private Sector Growth

Three outcomes were expected from the reforms to support private sector growth: an improved
business environment, the rebuilding of working capital of formal enterprises and the repayment
of CNE deposits and the establishment of a country wide financial network with a commercial
bank or mobile banking company.

    a. Improved business environment in Niger

As part of the GPR supported reform program, government reduced the business income tax
from 35 to 30 percent, adopted a new General Tax Code, and lowered the stamp duties for the
registration of new businesses. The indicators defined to assess the impact of these reform
measures are (i) the cost and time to set up a firm, (ii) the number of registered tax payers and
the evolution of business income tax collected. The explanation below shows that this outcome
was achieved.

The base lines of the cost and time to set up a firm were respectively US$475 and 19 days in
2008. The target was to reduce the cost and time to US$400 and 17 days by 2012. The Doing
Business 2013 data for Niger (using data of 2011) indicates cost and time to set up a firm
US$406 and 17 days. In March 2012, the Government issued a decree to reduce the time to 3
days.

The number of companies registered with a tax identification number increased on average by 16
percent between 2008-2012. The target of increasing the number of registered tax payers to
16,000 by 2012 was thus exceeded significantly. The number of enterprises subject to the
business income tax (ISB) increased annually at an average rate of 13 percent over the same
period. However, ongoing work on the impact of tax reforms suggests a significant disparity
between the number of registered tax payers and the number of tax payers who actually file their
tax returns.

                                                                                              21
Revenue from the business income tax dropped by about 20 percent in 2010, the first year that
the reduced business income tax rate of 30 percent was applicable. However, in 2011 business
income tax receipts started to recover. It is important to note that in 2009 business income tax
receipts were exceptionally high. Considering the period 2008 to 2011, business income tax
receipts increased on average by more than 10 percent per year. A Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment of the change in the tax rate is presently underway which will provide a more
detailed analysis of the impact of this reform measure.

   b. Rebuilding of the working capital of formal enterprises

GPRG-1 supported the repayment of arrears to private enterprises in the amount of FCFA 2.5
billion (which represents 0.7 percent of credit to the private sector) to help these enterprises
rebuild their working capital. The indicator defined to assess the achievement of the outcome is
the payment of arrears as a percentage of GDP, with the baseline defined as -0.8 percent of -0.8
percent in 2008 and a target of 0 percent in 2010. The target appears to be poorly specified and
inconsistent with the discussion in the program document for GPRG-1 which indicates that the
government’s domestic arrears reduction plan calls for the paying down of domestic arrears to
around 6-7 percent of GDP by 2013 with the hope of eliminating all arrears by 2017. IMF data
indeed suggest that government has made continuous progress in reducing arrears - by 0.6
percent of GDP in 2009, by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2010, and by 0.1 percent of GDP in 2011.
The targeted progress as stated in the program document has thus been significantly exceeded.
However, it is also important to note that Niger’s arrears consist of two main components. The
first is the stock of arrears that were accumulated prior to 2000 and whose reduction was the
primary objective of reforms supported by GPRG-1. This stock is being gradually reduced and
declined from FCFA 112.9 billion in 2009 to FCFA 92.8 billion in 2011. At the same time,
Government accumulated new arrears in 2010 and 2011, which increased from FCFA 6.4 billion
in 2009 to FCFA 23.1 billion in 2011.

   c. Repayment of CNE deposits and establishment of a country wide financial network by a
      commercial bank or a company offering mobile banking services in partnership with
      Niger Poste.

Government repaid frozen deposits of the Caisse Nationale d’Epargne (CNE), which previously
provided post office financial services. The objective of repaying 68.8 percent of outstanding
claims was met. Initially, it was also envisaged that the government would recapitalize and
operationalize the newly created FINAPOSTE, a postal bank with a country wide network.
However, the transition Government concluded that the creation of a competitive postal bank
would be too costly and adopted a strategy of seeking partnerships with existing financing
institutions to offer banking services in post offices. This decision was consistent with the
advice provided in the 2008 FSAP. Agreements with providers of mobile banking services have
been concluded and some financial institutions are using the CNE network to transfer money to
their clients. (The revised target was to have a national financial network of a commercial bank
or of a company offering mobile banking services in partnership with Niger Poste.) The spread
of mobile phone based banking services has far reaching impacts. For example, a recent study




                                                                                             22
shows that these services allow the more efficient delivery of cash transfer programs, especially
in areas with limited road and financial infrastructure.2

Address Infrastructure Constraints for Private Sector Growth

In the context of the GPR supported reform program, the authorities were to undertake reforms
to increase the sustainability of the Autonomous Road Maintenance Fund (CAFER) through
increased budgetary funding and to adopt a legal framework for public private partnerships.
Road maintenance expenditure increased from FCFA2.7 billion in 2008 to FCFA4.8 billion in
2009, FCFA5.1 billion in 2010, and FCFA6 billion in 2011. However, the Government decision
of not fully passing through international oil price increases to domestic fuel prices, which was in
place from 2009 to 2011, resulted in reduced transfers of fuel levy receipts to the road
maintenance agency. Increased spending on road maintenance was accompanied by more
effective control of vehicle overloading. While current levels of road maintenance are still
significantly below the estimated requirements for minimally adequate maintenance of the
existing network, further increases in spending will need to be accompanied by measures to
strengthen capacities and institutional arrangements for managing and monitoring the quality of
road maintenance work.

The result expected in this area was: “Road network is better maintained annually?. Initially, the
results indicator was defined as “the total road length maintained annually? with a baseline of
6000 km in 2008 and a target of 7,400 km in 2010. However, in the course of the preparation of
GPRC-2, it was determined that this indicator was not particularly meaningful as it does not
reflect the quality of maintenance and difficult to measure, as basic maintenance extends over the
whole road network. The initial indicator was thus replaced by two indicators to evaluate the
results: share of asphalt roads in good condition and share of non-asphalt roads in good
condition. The table below shows the evolution of these indicators:

Administrative data provided by the authorities suggest improvements in the road condition. The
proportion of asphalt roads in good condition increased from 51 in 2009 to 71 percent in 2011.
Similarly, the share of non-asphalt roads in good condition increased from 27.5 percent in 2009
to 76 in 2011 while the target for 2012 was 35 percent. However, given the uneven allocation of
funds for road maintenance and the suppression of direct allocation of funds to CAFER, these
data may significantly overestimate road conditions. More detailed data on the road condition in
2012 are currently being collected and will provide a more reliable assessment of the condition
of roads.

Reforms with regard of the establishment of a legal framework for public private partnerships
were not considered a priority by the military transition government. It was thus agreed to
postpone these reforms. Subsequently, the legal framework was prepared and adopted under the
successor budget support operation (SGC-1).

Support Agricultural Sector and Rural Development as the Main Generator of
Employment

Reforms undertaken in the area of rural development included the restructuring of the
agricultural inputs unit and the adoption of the integrated framework for extension services for
rural development. Two main results were expected: (i) enhanced access to, and use of
fertilizers and (ii) enhanced access to technology. Unfortunately, the political crisis led to a delay
in the surveys that were expected to provide the data for the assessment of these results.
Nonetheless, available data do suggest an increase in access to fertilizers:

      Regional, departmental and communal committees have been put in place to manage the
       distribution of fertilizer. These committees are composed of members of administrations,
       representatives of farmers' organizations and the private sector, while prior to the
       reforms, fertilizer management was performed by staff of the parastatal agency. The
       involvement of farmers' organizations at both the decision-making structures and at the
       level of input management is expected to improve the inclusion of their concerns,
       particularly in terms of accessibility and quality of inputs in accordance with soil
       characteristics of their land;
      The number of shops selling agricultural inputs rose from twenty in 2009 to 50 in 2011
       and 180 in November 2012. This multiplication of shops will help to improve the
       physical accessibility of inputs. It will also improve affordability due to lower
       transportation costs for farmers, as input prices are the same across the country;
      With the new legal status of the Agricultural Inputs Unit (CAIMA), it is now subject to
       annual audits by the Court of Accounts.

Regarding access to technology, efforts are being made by the government to ensure better
dissemination of agricultural technologies among producers. Pending the results of a customer
survey planned for 2013 which will provide feedback on government’s effort to enhance
extension services, the following actions reflect efforts to improve access to extension services:

      The number of demonstration plots increased from 129 in 2009 to 419 in 2011. Based on
       a ratio of one demonstration plot for 20 people, we deduce that more than 8,000 farmers
       were involved in 2011 against less than 3000 in 2009. According to forecasts, more than
       10,000 producers will benefit from 548 demonstration plots proposed in 2012, which
       corresponds to a growth of over 300 percent compared to the baseline of 2009.
      The practical demonstrations of new techniques increased from 240 points of
       demonstration in 2009 to 720 in 2011, with an increase in the number of beneficiaries
       from 3600 producers in 2009 to 10800 in 2011, representing an increase by 200 percent.
       For 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that the number of beneficiaries would be
       14,400.

                                                                                                   24

Address Public Finance Constraints

Reforms in this area aimed at strengthening the budget process and the promotion of sound
public finance management. They included measures to reduce delays in the processing of
payments, more comprehensive budget documentation submitted to Parliament, better alignment
of public expenditures with the PRSP, and a strengthening of the procurement system through
the adoption of a new Procurement Code in line with WAEMU directives and the revision of
procurement decrees relating to conflict of interest and control of contracts awards.

    (i)      Reduce delays in processing payments

The introduction of electronic processing of payables to private suppliers has reduced the time it
takes for private enterprises to receive payment from Government for goods and services
provided from about one month to an average of less than 10 days in 2010.3 The target was to
reduce the time to seven days by 2012, however, data for 2012 are not yet available. However,
the lack of integration between the budget and the Treasury systems results in liquidity
constraints which prevents government from paying its bills, which has led to an accumulation of
new arrears as discussed above.

    (ii)     Provide Parliament with adequate documentation to make decisions on the budget

The objective was to provide the National Assembly with more comprehensive budget
documentation for improved decision making. In 2008, budgetary documents submitted to the
National Assembly did not meet the information requirements set out in the organic public
finance law. In 2008, eight elements were missing in the presentation of the draft Finance Law to
Parliament, including: (a) the macroeconomic framework; (b) the fiscal deficit; (c) the financing
of the deficit; (d) the debt stock, (e) financial assets, (f) the status of budget execution in the
preceding year through a budget review law; (g) the status of current budget execution, and (h) a
summary budget table. In 2012, the documents submitted to parliament included the summary of
the budget, the macroeconomic framework, the state of implementation of the current budget,
debt policy and the analysis of debt sustainability, the annual liquidity plan, tax expenditures, the
situation of revenue to be recovered by the tax authorities and the situation of what remains to be
paid by the Treasury. Instead of the status of financial assets, a forecast of the dividends of these
assets was included. Thus significant improvements have been achieved compared to 2008, but it

                                                                                                                25
remains to complete the documentation by the status of budget execution through a budget
review law and the status of current budget execution. It is important to note that further
progress requires inclusion in the budget of information such as data of the budget estimates
from the previous year and information on actual spending from the preceding year, information
on revenue collected by certain ministries and own resources of parastatal institutions.

    (iii)   Accelerate implementation of PRSP-II through an increase in resources allocated to
            pro- poor expenditures

The GPR series monitored the alignment of budgetary expenditures with Niger’s PRSP. The
monitoring took place at two levels – expenditures on pro-poor expenditure items defined by the
authorities and expenditures in PRSP priority sectors. Budget allocations to pro-poor expenditure
items increased continuously from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.5 percent in 2012, only
interrupted by a decline in 2010, the year of the coup d’état. The target was that budget
allocations to pro-poor expenditures would reach 15 percent in 2012. However, in hindsight this
target clearly was not realistic. Actual expenditures increased at a similar pace as budget
allocations, though the budget execution rate remained at about 80 percent during the period and
efforts should be undertaken to increase the budget execution rate. Expenditure on priority
sectors funded from government’s own resources increased from 5.1 percent in 2007 to 7.7
percent in 2011, with a budget execution rate of about 90 percent.

Table 5: Pro-poor and priority sector expenditures (% of GDP), 2007-2012

                                            2007        2008      2009     2010   2011     2012

Pro-poor expenditures (Actual)              5.7%        6.8%      7.5%     6.2%
Priority-sector expenditures (Budget -
funded from own resources)                  5.1%        6.6%      7.3%     6.1%   7.7%
Priority-sector expenditures (Actual -
funded from own resources)                  4.0%        6.1%      6.0%     5.3%   7.0%

    (iv)    Procurement

The GPR series aimed at enhancing the efficiency and transparency of public procurement.
Government adopted a new Procurement code and revised decrees on conflict of interest and
control of contract awards in line with WAEMU directives. The indicator used is that of the
evolution of the percentage of public contracts awarded through competitive bidding, which was
less than 75 percent in 2008. A comprehensive measure of these indicators in 2009, 2010 and
2011 are not available. Currently, only the database of the Procurement Regulatory Agency is
available which represents about 50 percent of all procurements. The percentage of public
contracts awarded through competitive bidding was 90.91 percent in 2011 -significantly above
the target of at least 75 percent.

Demographics

GPRG-1 supported the creation of an appropriate institutional setup for the implementation of
Government’s Declaration on Population Policy (DGPP) at the central, regional, departmental,

                                                                                              26
and communal level. This has established the basis for meeting the GPR target in this area,
namely the implementation of annual action plans with funding from the general budget as well
as support from an IDA grant and other donors (e.g., UNFPA). Available data suggest already
some positive impact of the implementation of the policy, including the increase in exclusive
breast feeding from 4.4 percent in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009 and an increase in the use of
modern contraceptives from 4.4 percent in 2006 to 12 and possibly 16 percent in 2010. The
transition government consolidated responsibility for population issues, promotion of women,
and the protection of children in a single ministry, which is expected to facilitate the effective
implementation of the DGPP. The budget allocation for this ministry almost doubled from FCFA
3 billion in 2010 to FCFA 5.8 billion in 2011.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In terms of relevance, the focus of the GPR series on economic growth and public financial
management has remained highly relevant. The relevance of this focus has been reemphasized
in the Government’s new PRSP which was adopted in 2012 and which has as its primary
objective the achievement of sustainable shared growth. Specific policy areas supported by the
GPR series were consistent with the Government’s PRSP and the Banks CAS and also figure
prominently in the Government’s new PRSP and the Banks draft CPS for the period 2012 to
2014. The relevance rating is thus Satisfactory.

Achievements under the GPR series need to be considered in the context of the political turmoil
and exogenous shocks that characterized the period 2009-2012. The series permitted notably to
engage with difficult reforms despite the political turmoil and weak capacities of the country.
The different governments maintained the willingness to implement the reforms supported by the
program. The transition military government appropriated the reforms under GPRC-1 adopted in
March 2009, before the coup d’état of February 18, 2010; and the elected authorities endorsed
the reforms of GPRC-2 handed down by the transition government. The financial support
provided in 2010 and 2011 through GPRG-1 and GPRC-2 has been critical in allowing
Government to maintain macroeconomic and fiscal stability in the face of multiple pressures
emanating from the political and food crises. Achievements of the PDOs are mixed with some
not having achieved the envisaged targets. However, in all areas improvements did occur despite
the adverse external environment. On balance, the achievement of PDOs and other outcome
indicators is rated as Moderately Satisfactorily.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

GPR supported reforms were expected to contribute to poverty reduction by fostering economic
growth and greater efficiency and alignment with the PRSP of public expenditures. Preliminary
analysis of the data from the 2011 Living Standards Measurement Survey indicates that
headcount poverty dropped from 59 percent in 2007/08 to 56 percent in 2011, with a parallel
decline in the depth of poverty.



                                                                                               27
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Public financial management has been considerably strengthened in 2010 with the creation of an
independent Court of Auditors and the General Directorate of Treasury and Public Accounting
by improving the audit, accounting and reporting aspects. In October 2011, the government
adopted a comprehensive program of modernization (2011-2014) and reform of public finance
management which provides a road map for further reforms in this area, including the
implementation of the WAEMU directives on public financial management. In the agriculture
sector, the Agricultural Inputs Procurement Unit (AIPU) has been transformed into a public
enterprise with commercial/industrial objectives (EPIC) called “Central Procurement Unit for
Agricultural Inputs and Equipment? (Centrale d’Approvisionnement en Intrants et Equipement
Agricoles CAIMA). The new organizational structure and participation of producers in its
governance is expected to result in improved procurement and stock management and enhanced
responsiveness to producer needs. The GPR series was also instrumental in the establishment of
the institutional structures for the implementation of the Government’s population policy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The GPR series provided financial support at critical stages of the political transition and thus
contributed significantly to preventing macroeconomic instability and helped to address external
shocks encountered by the country. In particular, the coup d’état in February 2010 resulted in
the withholding of budget support by most donors, even though government had to deal with a
severe food crisis. IDA acted quickly to assess that all conditions for continued Bank support
under O.P. 7.30 were met. In close consultation with other development partners and regional
and international organizations and based on a credible plan and timetable for the country’s
return to a democratically elected regime, IDA declared GPRG-1 effective in May 2010 which
allowed it to provide important resources to the authorities to help fund government programs for
dealing with the severe 2010 food crisis. IDA’s proactive engagement with the transition
government and the incoming democratically elected government made it possible to appraise
and negotiate GPRC-2 shortly after the democratically elected government had taken office in
April 2011 and to provide resources to the new government early in its tenure, helping to get the
government program off the ground and also paving the way for budget support by other donors.
Finally, as Niger was severely affected by the return of a large number of migrant workers in the
wake of the Libyan crisis during the second half of 2011 and another severe food crisis in 2012,
IDA was quick to prepare a supplemental financing operation which helped to close an
unanticipated financing gap which had been created by the need to respond to severe economic
shocks.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

The sustainability of development outcomes is affected by risks at the macro level that affect the
overall development outcome of the GPR series as well as specific risks to the sustainability of
specific reform impacts.




                                                                                               28
At the macro level, development outcomes could be affected by the significant security, political,
and economic vulnerabilities of Niger. As in many of the reform areas achievement of the
desired results requires continued sustained reforms, capacity constraints also pose a significant
risk to the sustainability of results.

With respect to the sustainability of individual reform efforts, reforms that involved budget
allocations (for road maintenance and arrears clearance) or that provide only the first step of a
larger reform effort (such as the approval of a strategy for the reform of the extension system)
face high risks. However, most of the reforms supported by the GPR series are built on strong
consensus building efforts and commitment by the government and thus likely to be sustained.
Niger has also developed a fairly strong track record of sustaining reforms and for refraining
from reform reversals.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At entry, the GPR series focused on key issues for removing constraints to private sector led
growth and strengthening public financial management. It built upon the achievements of two
broader two-tranche DPOs (Rural and Social Policy Reform Credits – RSCR-1 and RSCR-2).
The GRP series had been designed within the same conceptual approach as the RSCR series,
including continued PFM reform, further strengthened by a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA2008) assessment, but with a shift in focus towards the growth agenda
instead of human development. The shift in focus helped to establish a clearer division of labor
with the European Union’s budget support, which focusses primarily on public financial
management and human development. This division of labor was formalized subsequently in the
context of the preparation of the successor programmatic budget support operation, which has a
joint policy matrix including IDA, the European Union, and, more recently, also the African
Development Bank.

The design of GPR series addressed key issues in removing obstacles to investment and private
sector led growth. However, there are a few instances where prior actions may not address the
key obstacles in a particular policy area. In particular, instead of focusing on the budget
allocation for road maintenance, in hindsight it would have been better to focus on a more
sustainable financing mechanism for road maintenance. Similarly, conditionality on arrears
settlement also faced the problem of sustainability of reforms and it may have been better to
focus on financial management reforms that would have contributed to preventing the
accumulation of arrears. GPR support to the reduction of the business income tax does not seem
to have fully considered the structure of the Nigerien economy and in particular, the role of
foreign participation in the mining sector. However the results framework was not adequately
developed to undertake a full assessment of the program achievements: (i) some of the results
indicators were poorly defined and difficult to measures and, (ii) in some cases, the link between
results targeted and reforms undertaken is not obvious.

                                                                                               29
The GPR operations were disbursed on agreed conditions. The programmatic approach helped to
maintain the focus on critical reforms and ensured that the Bank remained engaged in policy
dialogue with the authorities during and after the political crisis. The triggers and prior actions
were extensively discussed with the authorities, well focused, underpinned by good analytical
work, and took into account the government’s limited capacity. The risk analysis was
satisfactory, pointing out the substantial risks that Niger faced. The operations are designed to
contribute to country macroeconomic and social stability.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision of the credit was highly responsive to the two changes in government and successful
in engaging, ensuring commitment, and supporting successive governments in the
implementation of the GPR supported reform program. The team also exercised appropriate
flexibility in adjusting the program content and pace of reforms to the more limited mandate and
reform priorities of the military transition government, while the overall thrust of the program
was maintained. Supervision benefitted from strong management support, including participation
in missions. In the course of supervision, cooperation with the IMF and the EU was scaled up in
order to ensure a coordinated approach in dealing with the transition government, given the
complex and uncertain country environment. Six ISRs were prepared: two during 2009, one in
2010, one in 2011 and two during 2012. Aide-memoires on performance were prepared in close
consultation with the authorities and the potential impact of the economic and social context on
the overall performance of the operations was raised. Sector specialists and consultants
participated in the supervision missions, contributing valuable expertise and TA in each of the
operation’s policy areas. Bank management was highly supportive of the team.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Despite the difficult context, the successive governments remained committed to implement the
reforms supported by the program. The military transition government appropriated the reforms
under GPRC-1 adopted in March 2009, before the coup d’état of February 18, 2010; and the
elected authorities endorsed the reforms of GPRC-2 handed down by the transition government.
However, political turmoil, electoral period, food insecurity and public security management
have slowed down the implementation of reforms under the GPR series. The operations’ closing
dates were not extended.

6. Lessons Learned

The programmatic development policy operation approach proved extremely helpful in
maintaining dialogue and reforms in a rapidly changing political environment. In particular,
having an agreed reform program in place allowed the Bank to engage with the military
transition government at a technical level and to continue to support the implementation of these
reforms. It would have been unlikely that a new reform program could have been developed and
agreed with the transition government. Close collaboration with other partners in a complex

                                                                                                30
political environment is essential to come to a shared assessment of the situation and to adopt a
coordinated and coherent approach in dealing with a de facto government.

As highlighted in the 2012 CAS completion report, for a country like Niger budget support plays
an important role in buttressing the functioning of government: predictable and sustained budget
support plays a bigger role in Niger than in countries with a higher revenue base and less
external stress. A programmatic DPO approach plays an important role in keeping the reform
agenda on track and mobilizing the Government on cross-cutting issues in an environment of
frequent external shocks and instability. Most reforms would have never realized or accelerated

Annex 4: Summary of Borrower's ICRR and/or Comments on Draft ICRR

The Borrower broadly concurs with the assessment contained in the ICR and highlights the
adverse impact of the political crisis on the implementation of the program. The political crisis
also resulted in delays in the implementation of the planned agriculture survey to monitor results
and the Borrower expresses its commitment to carry out these surveys in order to be able to
assess the impact of these reforms. The Borrower also underlines the need to carefully define
outcomes and results indicators in order to be able to assess the impact of the program. The
Borrower expresses the importance of carefully defining intermediate and global results
indicators for institutional and legal reforms in future budget support operations.
