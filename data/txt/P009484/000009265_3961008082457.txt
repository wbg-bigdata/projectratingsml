MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 33.6 million, the equivalent of US$50.0
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance an agricultural research management
project that assists the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in generating and transferring agricultural technology
to producers and thereby increasing income and employment for poverty alleviation.
Sector and Project Background
2.          Bangladesh remains one of the least developed countries in the world, with an average per capita
income of US$220. About half of its population of 120 million is poor. Agriculture (crops, livestock, fisheries
and forestry) is vital in the economy, accounting for about 36 percent of GDP, 65 percent of employment and 17
percent of commodity export earnings. Economic growth sufficient to relieve poverty requires significant growth
in agricultural productivity and output or a massive shift of labor out of agriculture into other sectors.
3.          Raising agricultural output confronts several challenges. The principal one is to grow from a
resource base that is already very intensively used. The population of over 112 million people lives on 14.8
million hectares (ha), making Bangladesh one of the most densely populated country in the world. Arable land
covers 8.1 million ha--or roughly 55 percent of the national area--with another 1.9 million ha in forest or
woodland, so that there is almost no possibility to grow by cultivating more land. Of the national total of
roughly 19 million households, about 14 million are farm households (of which 7.7 million are landless). The
landless, and those operating holdings of less than 0.5 hectares (ha), have little or no asset base in which to
invest. Lastly, while expansion of irrigation and fertilizer use have contributed to recent growth, additional
irrigable land is becoming scarcer, the costs of new irrigation are expected to rise, and the marginal returns to
fertilizer have fallen from the levels of the mid-1980s. Though significant potential for expansion of irrigation
through use of cheap groundwater exists, the cheapest and easiest irrigation opportunities have now been
exploited.
4.          The second challenge is water control. While rainfall and surface waters are usually abundant,
recurrent droughts and floods make it difficult to sustain growth. Because production will always be subject to
the onset and intensity of the monsoons and to the severity of the dry season, costly investments in irrigation,
drainage, and flood control are needed to manage water, maintain coastlines and river banks against erosion, to
prevent salt water incursion and to protect inland fisheries from disruption by flood control and drainage
activities.
5.          The third challenge is the heterogeneity of agriculture. Arable land has been classified into 30
agro-ecological zones (AEZs) and 80 subzones according to soil type, land shape, probability of flooding, length
of growing season, and temperature. Although temperatures are generally suitable for crop production
throughout the year, distinct hot, warm and cool seasons make farm management complex in terms of the
appropriate mix of crops, livestock, forestry, aquatic species, and other activities. The various zones require
site-specific management practices which must be generated by research and promulgated by extension.
6.          Agriculture grew at 3.2 percent annually in the 1960s and at 2.5 percent from 1973-1987. Total
factor productivity growth--the contribution to output of research, technology transfer, education, and markets--
was weak, expanding by 0.78 percent from 1957-1985 and by 0.84 percent from 1975-1985. Growth was
slightly faster in the later 1980s, helped by the elimination of non-tariff barriers on pumps and power tillers, by
lower input tariffs which further promoted irrigation, and by the continued shift from local to modern rice



-2 -
varieties. Per capita food grain supply rose by about 6 percent from 1983 through 1993 and real rice prices fell
steadily from 1983 to the end of 1992. Though rice remains by far the most important crop, agriculture has
become more diverse, as raw jute fell from 43 percent to 31 percent of agricultural exports from 1984-86 to
1990-92, and as the share of crops in total agricultural output fell from about 82 percent to 62 percent. The
limited recent gains in output and productivity have not significantly boosted wages or reduced poverty and
malnutrition in rural areas. About half of the population remains poor and poverty is most severe in farming
areas. Malnutrition afflicts two-thirds of children under the age of five.
7.           Crops constitute roughly two thirds of agricultural GDP and foodgrains provide nearly 80
percent of the value of crop production. Rice is the most important, accounting for nearly 80 percent of cropped
area and 75 percent of the gross value of crop output. Jute is the principal industrial crop, occupying about six
percent of arable land. Production fluctuates widely in response to world prices. Average yields are low and
depend upon the onset of the rains and the ability of the farmer to carry out timely land preparation and sowing.
Jute cultivation may also be moving to marginal lands, particularly those subject to rapid flooding. Sugarcane is
the second industrial crop with about 185,000 ha. The share of the value of production of other crops ( maize,
pulses, oilseeds, spices, tea, fruits, and vegetables) is less than 5 percent.
8.           Livestock provides roughly 1 1 percent of agricultural GDP. There are about 23 million cattle,
or about 2.8 head per ha of cultivated land, another 30 million sheep and goats, and uncounted millions of
poultry. Cattle are crucial to the farm economy because they are the major source of draft power for cultivation
and transport and an important source of cash income. Smallholders and the landless hold 40 percent of the
national cattle herd, especially goats and poultry, making livestock an important subsector for the rural poor.
Livestock performance is poor because of scarce feed, diseases, and inadequate support services including
research.
9.           Fisheries of all types contribute some 13 percent of agricultural GDP. There are some 1.25
million commercial fishermen and over 11 million families derive income from fishing. About 80 percent of
production comes from capture fisheries (51 percent inland and 28 percent marine) and the balance mainly from
inland culture fisheries. Marine culture and shrimp cultivation in brackish water is expanding rapidly and shrimp
exports now account for over 80 percent of fisheries exports. Though increases in production can be expected
from improvements in capture technology, population growth, associated overfishing and low investment in
open-access fisheries have resulted in declining freshwater capture fishing from the levels of the late 1980s; a
Bank-supported Third Fisheries Project is assisting with institutional and technical changes to improve
freshwater capture fisheries. The proposed operation supports research on riverine and other freshwater capture
fisheries, to be undertaken by the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (FRI) to resolve the technical
problems
10.          Forestry contributes about 10 percent of agricultural GDP. The three principal forestry systems
cover about 3.0 million ha: the hill tracts of Chittagong, the tidal forests of the Sundarban in the southwest, and
homestead forestry throughout the country. Though the government owns about 2.0 million ha of natural forests
and plantations, more than 75 percent of fuelwood and industrial wood comes from privately-owned woodlots
and homesteads. Some public forest resources, particularly in the hill tracts, have been declining because of crop
encroachment, illegal felling and uncontrolled utilization. Private resources have come under increasing
pressure from population growth and rising incomes and the real price of fuelwood has risen. Some changes
have been brought about under the IDA-supported Forest Resources Management Project (Cr. 2397-BD) on
forest resources conservation and protection.



- 3 -
11.         Agricultural Policy seeks to stimulate growth in order to raise rural incomes, cut poverty, and
improve food security. Three broad instruments are employed to achieve those objectives. The first is the
continued liberalization and deregulation of the economy, which is intended to better the business climate for the
private sector and thereby to improve economic growth. The second is targeted intervention for poverty
alleviation, such as food for work, vulnerable group development, and directed credit. The third is public
investment in human capital, physical infrastructure (including roads, markets, irrigation, drainage, flood
control) and technical change through research and extension.
12.         The recent policy regime has been comparatively neutral. There are now few quantitative
restrictions on international trade in farm goods. Many government regulations on domestic food trade have
been eliminated. The prices of the major goods are closely aligned to world market prices; for example, the
long-term nominal protection coefficient of urea, the main fertilizer input, is 0.9, while the domestic price of rice
has recently fallen between the fob and CIF prices, according to the size of the domestic harvest. Bank sector
work on diversification (World Bank, Report 14315-BD) has recommended changes in policies to eliminate
remaining distortions. Extensive studies for a national Flood Action Plan (FAP) have been completed and the
FAP has been approved by the Cabinet. The Govermnent is now preparing a water resources strategy with
emphasis on economically and environmentally sound and sustainable investments, both non-structural and
structural. The measures taken under the proposed operation are fully consistent with the water resources
strategy in that they would assist in generating technology to raise productivity in irrigated and drained areas.
Agricultural Research
13.         Research Organization. The independent Government began to develop research in 1973 by
creating new institutions to study commodities or particular disciplines. The national agricultural research
system (NARS), comprising ten Agricultural Research Institutes (ARls) and the Bangladesh Agricultural
Research Council (BARC), now employs about 1370 scientists. The main organizations in the NARS are
BARC, the apex organization responsible for research policy and national coordination; Bangladesh Agricultural
Research Institute (BARI), Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI); Fisheries Research Institute (FRI);
Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI); Bangladesh Forestry Research Institute (BFRI); Bangladesh
Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA); Bangladesh Soils Research and Development Institute (SRDI); Cotton
Development Board (CDB); Bangladesh Tea Research Institute (BTRI); Bangladesh Jute Research Institute
(BJRI); and Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI).
14.         Research Strategy. The government has an agricultural research strategy, whose goal is to
"improve the well-being of present and future generations of farmers and consumers in Bangladesh, particularly
those with low incomes." Specific objectives are to generate technologies that enhance productivity for crops,
livestock, fisheries, and forestry. The actions of the research strategy are: (a) reorientation of research into
profitable, relevant and sustainable programs; (b) establishment of the farm unit as the research nexus;
(c) improvement of research management to emphasize sound planning and human resource development; and
(d) improvement of client (farmer, extension worker, and consumer) focus in defining priorities and evaluating
research products. The strategy was discussed with IDA at appraisal and found satisfactory. The strategy is an
important step, but it does not sufficiently address governance, scientific incentives, performance evaluation and
accountability, and stakeholder participation in the research system. To implement the strategy more effectively,
the Government agreed at negotiations to carry out a Policy Reform Program, consisting of a policy statement,
derived from the agreed strategy and acceptable to IDA, declaring its intention to confer greater autonomy upon



-4 -
the ARIs in the areas of budget, personnel, and management; and a plan of actions to confer greater autonomy
to the ARIs, thereby allowing them to manage resources more flexibly and efficiently.
15.         ARIs prepare their five-year master plans and annual programs within the strategic framework
built by BARC. These master plans provide a summary of current and proposed institute research and training
programs, together with an assessment of additional facilities and resources needed. However, they are very
general, only partially prioritize future research programs, and do not relate priority research programs to
quantified constraints or problems. Under the proposed operation, the government agreed to bolster research
priority definition and program evaluation by sharpening their quantitative focus, improving client orientation,
and justifying resource requirements in terms of the agreed priorities.
Barriers to Better Research
16.          Scientists have not always produced new and profitable technologies that respond to the high
variability in national farming systems--soils, water, land forms, biotic and abiotic stresses, farmers'
circumstances, and changing prices. The main barriers to better research are inadequate and unstable funding,
weak research planning, insufficient client orientation, inadequate scientific incentives, institutional isolation, the
ineffectiveness of BARC, incomplete financial management capacity, and duplication of research activities
across ARls.
17.         Inadequate and Unstable Funding. The national average spending on agricultural research for
1988/89 through 1992/93 was 0.4 percent of agricultural GDP, a share which is low by international standards
and by the standards of Bangladesh's regional competitors in agricultural markets. Spending may even decline in
the near future, because USAID, previously a major donor, stopped funding the Bangladesh NARS in 1994.
Funding has also been unstable and of inappropriate composition, partly because of its sources. For 1991/92,
GOB revenue funds accounted for 30-35 percent and development funds for 65-70 percent of recurrent
expenditures. The development budget is typically 60 percent external funds and 40 percent GOB funds.
Donors provide most capital expenditures and non-salary operational costs. The dependence on external funds
causes uncertainty for BARC, BRRI, BLRI and BFRI, whose personnel costs are entirely paid through the
development budget. When donor funding ceases, very little is left for operation and maintenance (O&M).
There are three direct consequences of this low level of GOB funding of operational costs: first is the
interruption of work when external funding ceases; second is the underutilization of fixed assets resources
(principal staff, land, ponds, nurseries); and third is the chronic dilapidation of facilities.
18.         The proposed operation would provide both immediate and longer-term solutions to the funding
problems. First, it gives funds for capital: construction of new facilities and rehabilitation of old ones; for
laboratory and other scientific equipment; for computing equipment and software, which are now very scarce;
and for vehicles. Second, the project provides adequate operating costs (including funds for a small number of
new scientists in the newer ARIs) so that the existing and additional capital stock can be fully used. Third,
during preparation, the GOB transferred personnel costs from the development budget to the revenue budget,
thus making funding more stable and assured. Fourth, during implementation the GOB has agreed to define the
necessary legal and administrative steps to make the ARIs more autonomous, so that they can manage resources
and respond to client needs more flexibly. Fifth, the GOB has agreed to terms of reference for a study of private
financing of research, including that from producers' organizations, so as to broaden the financing base of
research. Lastly, supervision of the operation will specifically monitor total project funding, and funding for
each of its executing agencies, and discuss needed corrective measures with the Government during
implementation



-5 -
19.          Weak Research Planning. Planning at BARC or in the ARIs does not rank researchable
problems in terms of economic benefits or other relevant criteria. Other defects in planning include: (a) lack of
sustained institutional analytical capacity to undertake continuous priority-setting; (b) inadequate participation of
biological scientists; (c) excessive focus on resource allocation across commodities, with little effort to estimate
expected costs and benefits of individual projects; (d) inadequate tools to track resource use, so that there has
been no monitoring of the implementation of the work; and (e) not enough formal ex-post evaluation leading, for
example, to closure of unsuccessful ventures or to expansion of successful ones. Scientists therefore work
without clear direction about the benefits of their work and how it is evaluated. Under the proposed operation,
the Government would analyze proposed research projects in terms of net economic benefits and take other
measures to strengthen research planning.
20.          Insufficient Client Orientation. Client orientation has two broad aspects: relations between
scientists and the agents of technolog transfer (mainly extension workers, whether public, private, or social);
and relations among scientists, extension workers, and farmers, where the latter include commercial and
subsistence producers. Inadequate information exchange among scientists, extensionists and policy-makers
mean that research recommendations do not always reach farmers, or that they are not adopted for lack of inputs.
ARI work is mainly on research stations. Developed technologies, as a result, have sometimes not been
adaptable to farming systems in the different AEZs. In addition to verifying key technologies, such as the
adaptability of rice and wheat varieties, FSR has created awareness among commodity researchers and extension
staff for the need to have technologies fit well within farming systems. The program has been constrained with
nsufficient prioritization, poor management and inadequate skill mix of the interdisciplinary working groups,
lack of continuity of financial support, and insufficient links with extension and NGOs. The proposed operation
has a participatory FSR component to assist in resolving those problems.
21.          Inadequate Scientific Incentives. Motivation and retention of scientific staff is the crucial
incentive question. The civil service does not reward outstanding scientific work or sanction bad performance.
The ARIs cannot sufficiently control appointments, transfers, promotions, and compensation. Personnel changes
depend on seniority, not on merit. Evaluation is not sufficiently linked to performance targets and job
descriptions. The proposed operation would facilitate a shift to autonomy for the research institutes that would
allow them to recruit, retain, compensate, and manage highly-skilled scientists more efficiently than is possible
under current civil service rules. Existing staff rules would be revised to ensure uniformity across NARS in
control of appointments and promotions by NARS; promotion on merit against seniority; and transparent
performance evaluation, based on lucid job descriptions.
22.          Isolated Institutions. An impediment to productivity is the bureaucratic isolation of the ARls.
This is most striking where livestock and fisheries have been divorced from crops research, even in such
naturally integrated areas as shrimp-rice farming or using animals for cultivation; moreover, individual crops
such as rice, jute, sugarcane, and cotton are often studied in isolation because that is the way the ARIs are
organized. The result has been a lagging supply of technologies to fit into the varied farming systems across the
AEZs. The proposed operation would specifically allocate money for joint initiatives among ARIs, and other
institutions, to produce integrated studies on issues of collective interest. The agreed guidelines for research
project generation and approval would harmonize the approach to priority setting across the ARls, and
encourage them to work together on common issues.
23.          Ineffectiveness of BARC. The BARC Ordinance and the ARIs' Ordinances have sometimes
made BARC ineffective in exercising its mandate to coordinate research. A core issue is that BARC's mandate



- 6 -
conflicts with those of the ARIs. BARC's 1988 Ordinance called for it to plan and approve ARIs' research
programs and to manage and implement research. The mandates of ARls--including SRI and BFRI, which are
managed by their respective ministries as government departments--permitted them to manage their research
programs without BARC's approval. Second, there are multiple governing bodies. The ARls, except SRI and
BFRI, are managed by governing bodies of the same status as that of BARC's, making it more difficult for
BARC to exercise its authority. Changes in the Ordinances of BARC and the ARls, discussed and agreed with
IDA duinng project preparation have already begun to be implemented and would eliminate these conflicts.
24.         Incomplete Financial Management Capacity. The financial systems of BARC and the NARS
are inadequate. Financial controls achieve their primary purpose of minimizing fraud, but cause unproductive
delays. Expenditures are not clearly defined by activities or programs. Funding shortfalls, which should prune
low priority programs and leave high priority ones, affect all equally. The management information system
(MIS) at the BARC Secretariat and the ARIs does not have a budgeting and accounting system; and ARI
accounting staff have not received training in the MIS. The proposed operation would assist in upgrading the
financial capacity of the ARIs through technical assistance and by completing the financial module of the MIS
throughout the NARS.
25.          Research Duplication. There is a lack of coordination among ARIs leading to duplication and
repetition. Management at some ARIs appears unwilling to stop research projects that repeat work done
elsewhere or at some earlier time in Bangladesh. Some facilities are duplicated across ARIs, indicating some
possible gains from consolidation. Resources provided for improved management under the proposed operation
would strengthen research coordination. The adoption of a system of ex-ante research program analysis in the
ARIs would also force scientists and managers to allocate resources more strictly with less repetition of previous
experiments. The Government agreed at negotiations on an action plan to reduce duplication across ARIs,
including rationalization of existing facilities.
26.          Lack of Private Sector Financing of Research. There is no private sector research financing
though good possibilities exist in industrial crops (tea, jute, sugarcane, cotton, maize), fisheries (notably pond
culture) and forestry. At negotiations, terms of reference for a study of means of expanding pnvate-sector
financing of agricultural research was agreed with completion of the study satisfactory to IDA by December 31,
1996. The study will include analysis of means to create and strengthen farmers' organizations, both to raise
their eventual material contribution to research and to increase their input into the research process itself.
Project Description
27.          The project objective is to increase the efficiency of the national agricultural research system
and thereby to generate profitable, relevant, and sustainable agricultural technologies for Bangladeshi
agricultural producers. The project would achieve its objective through: (a) strengthening BARC's
capacities in research organization and management, including better research resource allocation;
(b) supporting priority research; and (c) strengthening research linkages to extension through participatory
farming systems research.
Project Costs and Financing
28.          Total project costs are estimated at US$59.1 million. Project baseline costs are US$52.9 million;
physical contingencies are US$2.2 million and price contingencies are US$4.0 million. An IDA credit would



- 7 -
provide US$50.0 million and the Government of Bangladesh would provide US$9.1 million. Of the total project
cost, US$46.2 million would be for investment and US$12.9 would be for incremental recurrent costs.
A breakdown of proiect costs and the financing vlan are presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are in Schedule B. A timetable of key
nroiect processing events and the status of Bank Group Onerations in Bangladesh are shown in
Schedules C and D. resvectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 14467 BD, dated December 28, 1995 is
being distributed separately.
Project Implementation
29.          BARC and the ARIs will implement the project over five years. A project subcommittee
satisfactory to IDA has been established and would be maintained during the life of the operation. The chairman
of BARC chairs the subcommittee. Other members are designates of the chief executives of the relevant ARIs,
representatives of the extension services at least at the level of director; representatives of the participating
ministries, including Finance, at the level of at least Deputy Secretary; and BARC's Member Director Planning
and Evaluation who would serve as the Secretary of the subcommittee.
30.          The ARIs will manage their respective components. BARC and each ARI will prepare
semiannual reports, acceptable to IDA, showing progress against targets, with explanation of delays, an outline
of remedial actions, and a plan of action for the next six months. The agencies will report to their ministries,
BARC, and IDA within three months after the six-month period. BARC's reports will describe the physical
aspects of its component, implementation of policy reforms, budget, and the updating of the agricultural research
strategy. Evaluation of the project and of research would be done by the implementing agencies, and lessons
learned would be incorporated in the following year's programs. The PMEC Division of the Secretariat would
review all annual reports and programs. Evaluation reports would be analyzed and discussed by BARC when
decisions are being made on future programs of the agencies.
Experience Under Prior Projects
31.         IDA has supported agricultural development in Bangladesh with more than 25 credits. Increased
food production has been the main goal of IDA's lending with emphasis on minor irrigation, research and
extension, flood control and drainage, fisheries, forestry and, recently, support services. IDA-supported projects
include: Agricultural Support Services (Cr. 2233-BD); National Minor Irrigation Development (Cr. 2246-BD);
Shallow Tubewell and Low-Lift Pump Irrigation (Cr. 2253-BD); Forest Resources Management (Cr. 2397-
BD); Third Fisheries Cr. 2146-BD); Shrimp Culture (Cr. 165 1-BD); Bangladesh Water Development Board
Small Schemes (Cr. 1467-BD); Flood Control and Drainage III and IV (Crs. 1591-BD and 1784-BD); Small
Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation II (Cr. 1870-BD); Bangladesh Water Development Board System
Rehabilitation (Cr. 2099-BD) and Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Project ( Cr. 2783-BD) .
32.          Previous agricultural research operations were Agricultural Research I (ARP-I) and II (ARP-II)
(Cr. 828-BD of US$6 million in 1978 and Cr. 1455-BD of US$24.5 million in 1985), completed in
December 31, 1984 and June 30, 1992, respectively. ARP-I and ARP- II strengthened BARC headquarters,
three BARI regional stations, two research institutes ( FRI and BLRI) were established. Funds were provided for
contract research on cropping systems, soil and water management, agricultural engineering and crop protection,
and for training and technical assistance to formulate and implement monitoring and evaluation procedures of the
Contract Research Scheme. Salient research results were the identification of suitable technologies for different



- 8 -
cropping patterns, the determination of zinc and sulfur deficiencies in rice production, the estimation of crop
water responses, and staff training.
33.          The principal lesson of those operations is that public agricultural research cannot yield
productive and sustainable results without deep institutional reforms. Relevant lessons of previous operations,
including ARP-I and ARP-11, are: (a) BARC requires more autonomy in relation to the ministries, so as to
exercise its intellectual leadership of the ARIs; (b) BARC must improve its managerial capability, including
more efficient procedures for contract research and for evaluating research; (c) research institutes need
autonomy to ensure that their programs respond to client needs, are scientifically sound, and give staff full
incentives for good work (d) operating costs should be funded from the revenue budget, thus helping research
programs to be sustainable after project completion; (e) financial procedures should be computerized to provide
rapid retrieval for management decisions ; and (f) greater effort is needed to use modem methods of research
priority setting, including building a consensus among scientists about the validity and utility of those methods.
34.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. Sustained investment in agricultural research is necessary to
raise total factor productivity in farming; output growth sufficient to raise incomes of poor producers and the
landless cannot be realized by additional inputs alone. The justification for sustained public agricultural research
is that some of its fruits are public goods. Private agents do not have full incentives to invest in such goods
because they cannot receive the full return to their investment. Moreover, in Bangladesh there is little or no
private agricultural research at the present time; the proposed operation includes measures to promote private
research including funding contract research on a competitive basis with NGOs, universities, and others outside
the government research system. The specific rationale for IDA involvement is to assist in the production of
public research goods, to promote administrative and procedural reforms in the NARS, to assist in making
public investment more sustainable, and in reorienting investment to more efficient ends. The Government of
Bangladesh has requested IDA assistance to strengthen national agricultural research and to achieve those goals
35.          Country Assistance Strategy. The project is fully consistent with the  Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) which was discussed by the Executive Directors on November 9, 1995. The CAS emphasizes,
inter alia, the importance of agricultural growth, development of rural infrastructure, institutional reform and
capacity building and the need for productivity growth to raise incomes and reduce rural poverty.
Agreed Actions
36.          During negotiations, the following key agreements were reached with GOB:
(a)   Policy Reform Program. The Government agreed to carry out a Policy Reform Program,
consisting of: a policy statement, derived from the agreed strategy and acceptable to IDA,
declaring its intention to confer greater autonomy upon the ARIs in the areas of budget,
personnel, and management; and a plan of actions to confer greater autonomy to the ARIs,
thereby allowing them to manage resources more flexibly and efficiently.
(b)   ARI Master Plans. The Government agreed to complete ARI Master Plans by December 31,
1996 and to have them reviewed and accepted by the Association;
(c)   Research duplication. The Government agreed to: (i) prepare an action plan to reduce
duplication of research facilities and activities in the ARIs by December 31, 1996; and (ii) carry
out the action plan after receiving IDA's comments on it;



- 9 -
(d)   Private-sector financing of research. The Government agreed to complete a study of means of
expanding private-sector financing of agricultural research by December 31, 1996;
(e)   Ex-ante economic analysis. The Government agreed to a method of ex-ante economic analysis
and would apply it as part of BARC and ARI evaluation of research projects in the ARI Master
Plans;
(f)   Research proposal preparation rules and procedures. The Government agreed to: (i) rules
and procedures acceptable to IDA; and (ii) apply the rules and procedures to all research projects
to be implemented beginning July 1, 1996;
(g)   Contract research scheme The Government agreed to rules and procedures satisfactory to IDA
for the operation of the contract research scheme;
(h)  Joint research initiatives. The Government agreed to a list of joint research initiatives for
funding under the Contract Research Scheme;
(i)   Midterm review. The Government agreed on: (i) terms of reference for a midterm review of the
project to be held no later than September 30, 1998; (ii) monitorable indicators of project impact
to be used by the mid-term review including information needed to update the ex-ante economic
analysis; and (iii) to make necessary changes in project implementation as recommended by the
midterm review; and
(j)  Implementation indicators. The Government agreed on monitorable indicators to assess project
implementation, including information needed to update the ex-ante economic analysis; and
37.          Since negotiations, GOB has promulgated the revised BARC ordinance. Conditions of credit
effectiveness are: (i) Receipt by IDA of the agreed agricultural research policy statement; (ii) Approval of the
Project Proforma; and (iii) all concerned authorities would issue executive orders, acceptable to IDA, mandating
use of the research proposal preparation rules and procedures beginning July 1, 1996.
Environmental Impact
38.          The project has an environmental rating of 'C' because its environmental effects are expected to
be positive or neutral. The positive effects are that it supports research to improve agricultural sustainability. It
would lead to better recommendations for natural resource management and protection. Examples are soil
fertility maintenance, replacement of rice monoculture with polyculture, more sustainable rice-wheat rotations,
and integration of forestry, fisheries and livestock with cropping. Research on disease and insect tolerant
cultivars as part of integrated pest management will lessen use of agricultural chemicals and reduce health and
environmental risks from them. Population and ecological studies and improved management practices for
freshwater and marine fish will determine ways of maintaining the environment and of reversing earlier
degradation. Because civil works would be minor and carried out in existing ARI facilities, their environmental
impacts would be minimal. The project would have no cultural property, indigenous peoples, or resettlement
effects.

Program Objective Categories
39.          The project, as part of the GOB Five Year Development Program, would address technology
development, natural resource management, and environmental improvement through research leading to higher
agricultural productivity.
Project Beneficiaries
40.          Beneficiaries would include farmers, scientists, extension workers , NGOs and other private
agents in Bangladesh.
Project Benefits
41.          The expected returns to the project are high because it builds on previous investments in research
infrastructure and trained staff. Improvements in research organization and management would induce greater
efficiency through the identification of efficient research priorities. Support to priority research would generate
profitable and appropriate technology that responds to farmers' needs. Farming systems research would fortify
links among farmers, extension services and NGOs, and promote the transfer of new technology to poor farmers,
thus increasing production and income. The commodities benefiting from research supported under the operation
(for example, rice, wheat, potatoes, fish, milk, fi-uits and vegetables) are both produced and consumed by the
landless and small farmers, so much of the expected research benefits would go to the rural poor.
Economic Analysis
42.          The expected benefits of research on 35 major commodities, comprising more than 95% of
agricultural output, were estimated using an ex-ante economic model. The resulting economic rates of return
(ERRs) were above the 12 percent target return for 32 of the 35 commodities. The average of the values across
ARIs was 53.4%; the values by ARI ranged from 11.1 % (BJRI, jute research) to 90.7 % (BRRI, rice research).
Analysis was done of the effects of four additional variables on the ERRs for each ARI: (i) 25% lower output
prices; (ii) a 25% longer time needed for farmers to adopt new technology; (iii) a 50 % decrease in the
probability of successful research; and (iv) a 75 % increase in the total cost of research after accounting for the
marginal costs of the public funds used to finance the scientific institutions. Adverse changes in those variables
did not cause the aggregate ERRs of any institute to fall below 29%, with the noted exception of jute.
43.         The budget impact of the project is small; public expenditure on agriculture (excluding public
spending on water resources) in the FY96 Annual Development Program (ADP) is planned to be about US$243
million and average annual project spending is US$11.8 million, or 5 % of the total. Moreover, the impact of the
project on the composition of public expenditure is favorable in that it moves spending away from market
interventions and towards research, which has a greater public goods component.
Risks
44.          There are four major general risks. They are the Government's ability and commitment to:
(a) complete the agreed institutional reforms; (b) manage research, including interagency coordination; (c)
allocate adequate funds to research; and (d) implement all project provisions, including technical assistance and
training. These risks are addressed as follows: (a) institutional reforms were agreed in advance and will be



-11 -
supported by a policy statement from the Minister of Agriculture to IDA. The executive orders to implement the
new research management procedures would be issued before effectiveness; (b) strengthening research
management, staff development, and coordination among agencies and clients, including extension, NGOs and
farmers; (c) a satisfactory arrangement has been made to transfer adequate allocations to the revenue budgets for
the project; the Government agreed at negotiations that adequate funds would be made available for the project;
and (d) timely establishment of a special account, recruitment of key consultants, streamlining implementation
of training and contract research, and maintaining a project subcommittee at BARC to monitor implementation.
IDA supervision and a mid-term review will identify problems and suggest correctives.
45.          The major risks to the operation might cause delays in harvesting benefits from research
investments. These delays have been incorporated into the ex-ante economic analysis as a longer time needed
for adoption of new technologies generated by research. An adoption time 25 % longer poses no risk that the
expected ERRs ratios would fall below 12% in any ARI, except BJRI. Particular attention will be paid to BJRI
during supervision of the proposed project. There are additional specific risks that may affect the Fisheries
Research Institute (FRI). In the areas of riverine, brackish, and marine fisheries, the ex-ante rates of return are
lower (between 11.4 % and 17.3%) and are subject to adverse risks from low commodity prices and low
probabilities of research success. The plans for technical assistance and IDA supervision for the FRI component
of the proposed operation consider these rate of return risks and corrective actions will be taken as needed during
implementation. Moreover, FRI research is in an environmentally and socially important area and should
produce benefits both for the environment and for the poorest groups in the country.
Recommendation
46.          I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and recommend that the Executive directors approve it.
