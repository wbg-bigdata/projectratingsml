GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower.                Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC)
Guarantor                India, acting by its President
Amount:                  US$450.0 million equivalent
Terms:                   Repayment over 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's stan-
dard variable interest rate. ONGC would bear the foreign exchange and
interest rate risks.
Guarantee Fee:           The Government of India (GOI) would charge a guarantee fee of 1% p.a. on
the outstanding amount of the Bank loan.
Project Description:     The objectives of the project are:
(a) to eliminate the flaring of about 12 million cubic mneters of associated
gas per day (MMCMD) in the Bombay High oil field and improve the
management of the Bombay High reservoir in order to arrest the
decline of oil production and optimize the ultimate recovery of hydro-
carbons;
(b) to reduce energy shortages and contribute to greater efficiency of
energy use in India's Westem Region; and
(c) to promote a greater participation of private oil companies in India's oil
and gas sector.
The project is designed to recover about 25.3 MMCMD of additional gas
from the Bombay High oilfield. The infrastructure facilities that will be
constructed under the project will make it possible for ONGC to transport
up to 29 MMCMD of additional gas supplies from offshore fields in the
Western region to the Hazira gas terminal in the State of Gujarat and to
Uran, near Bonmbay. The project, which has been designed consistent with
environmentally sound principles, includes:
* erection of two process platforms;
* construction of three submarine pipelines: i.e. (i) a 28 inch pipeline from
the southern sector of the Bombay High oilfield to the South Bassein
gas field, (ii) a 42 inch ripeline from the South - Bassein gas field to the
Hazira gas terminal, ..i (iii) a 30 inch pipeline from the southern
sector of the Bombay sHiL., oil field to the Heera oil field where it
connects with the Heera - Uran trunkline;
* the expansion of the existing gas terminal at Hazira to process the

ii
additional gas supplies. This will nearly double the current capacity of
the terminal.
•  the provision of support for a reservoir study of the Bombay High
oilfield. The aim of this study is to optimize oil and gas production
from this, India's largest oilfield, and reduce the chances for the recur-
rence of excessive gas flaring. In parallel, the project will provide
support for the training of ONGCs technical staff.
*   the provision of support for the implementation of a package of mea-
sures required to achieve proper reservoir mnanagement practices in the
Bombay High oilfield.
*   the provision of support also for ONGCs ongoing efforts to reduce the
risk of environmnental damages from its offshore drilling operations and
to improve the overall safety of thewe operations.
Project Benefits:        The investments under the proposed project will increase indigenous oil
production by about 4 million tons per year and eliminate the flaring of
about 12 MMCMD of gas. The resulting increase in gas supplies will reduce
imports of naphtha, which would be otherwise required for the manufacture
of fertilizer, and of middle distillates for peak load power generation. This
will save India about US$350 million of foreign exchange annually (from
1995/96 onwards) that would otherwise be required for the import of these
fuels. The total net present value of the investment is approximately US$1.3
billion.
Project Risks:           The project faces three major risks, i.e. (i) delays in the implementation of the
project which would sharply reduce its viability, (ii) delays in the offtake of
the additional gas that will be made available through the project, and (iii)
the possibility that ONGC will not be able to raise the foreign exchange
required for the project. To minimize the risk of implementation delays,
ONGC has agreed to award the construction of major items, such as plat-
forms and submarine pipelines, on the basis of a series of contracts under
single responsibility. In addition, ONGC has w-srzd closely with the Bank
to streamline its organization and management for the implementaticn of
projects. The bidding documents for all but two of the major components of
the project will have been reviewed by the Bank before the loan becomes
effective. The risk of delays in the offtake of the gas will be signiticantly
reduced through the Govemment's decision to set up a special monitoring
committee in the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas that will review
quarterly the progress in implementing the proposed project as well as the
projects that will utilize the additional gas supplies. The quarterly reports of
the monitoring committee will be submitted to the Bank for review together
with recommendations in case of any slippage in project implementatioi..
The Bank will have an opportunity to review the implementation of these
recommendations. To minimize the risk that difficulties in the financing of
the foreign exchange components delay the project, the Bank has worked
closely with ONGC and the Govemment to ascertain the availability of
finance through export credit agencies and suppliers' credits.

1. 1IHE. ENER(;Y SECTI'OR
Role of Energy in the Indian Economy
1.01        Energy remains critical for the Government's efforts to accelerate evonomic giowth. T'he
Government is aware of this, and continues to invest about one-third of public resources in the develop-
ment of indigenous energy resources. Tl.e acceleration of economic growth during the 1980s has strainexd
the capacity of the energy sector to meet the surge in the demand for energy and, in spite of massive
investments in the expansion of oil, gas, coal and power sectors, energy demand continues to outstrip
supply. Thus, in the years ahead, India will again have to contend with the economic implications of
sharply rising oil imports.
1.02        This puts the Government in a difficult position. It is under pressure to improve the balance
of payments, reduce the budget deficit and provide a modicum of economic growth in order to avoid
losing whatever progress has been made in the reduction of poverty during the 1980s. Und',r these
circuinstances, an increase of oil imports will most likely necessitate a reduction in the imports of capital
goods, while a cut in public expenditures will slow the development of indigenous energy resources
leading to a further increase of oil imports in later years. This leaves the Government with few options.
Assuming the Government continues to pursue its objective of accelerating growth in order to reduce
poverty and provide employment for a rapidly growing labor force, it will need to ensur- that energy is
used efficiently, thus eliminating the demand caused by wasteful energy use. It will also need to ensure
that investments in expanding energy production are guided by efficiency considcrations. This coulJ be
achieved with a shift towards fewer controls and greater reNiance on market forces.
1.03        Managing the transitioni tow. ;-ds a more open, market-oriented energy sector will bxe a
formidable task, since it will be carried out in an environment of increasingiv severe budget and balance
of payments constraints. The proposed project is a step in this direction. Its objectives are to eliminiate the
wasteful flaring of gas, improve the reservoir management of the Bombay lHigh oilfield, reduce the need
for oil imports and help meet the energy needs in India's rapidly growing western region. While the
proposed project supports change towards a more oren energy sector, it is only the beginning ot a diffi-
cult transition. The following paragraphs highlight the main issues and constramints which the Government
needs to address in order to raise the efficiency of energy use and indigenious energy prOduction.
India's Rapidly Growing Energy Demand
1.04        The acceleration of economic growth during the 1980s has led to a sharp increase in the
demand for commercial energy. While the economy grew at an average rate of 4.5%c betweeni 1979/80 ar,d
1989/90, commercial energy demand grew at a rate of 6%. Within commercial energy, the demand for oil
products and electric power showed the fastest growth. Their demand grew at 7% and 9.57, respectively.
1.05        In spite of the iast growth of energy demar.d, India's overall level of energy consumnptioni is
low compared to that of other developing countries. While IndianE consume about 2(X) kilograms ot oil
equivalent (kgoe) per capita, Chinese consume 540 kgoe and Brazilians 84() kgoe. Althouigh energy
consumption is relatively low in absolute terms, the Govmrnment is concerned ahout it, rapid grovth and
the relatively low efficiency with which energy is used. l1o curb the growth of delrr denmul a!id imi

prove the efficiency of energy use, the Government continues to pursue a i wo-pronged approach. To slow
the growth of power consumption and the use of imported oil products, tho Government rel.es primarily
on rationing. In parallel, the Government has introduceo several energy coi'servation' programs to
eliminiate the wasteful use of energy. Overall, the strategy has not been very efiective. Two factors art
primari!y responsible for that: the reletively high energy intensity of major sectors of the Indian economy
and the ineffectiveness of energy conservation; rograms.
h-igh tnergy Intensity
1 .(K        Perhaps the most important factors behind the fast growth of energy consumption are the
relatively high energy intensity of India's industrial sector and the rapidly growing energy intensity of the
agrictiltural sector.
1.07         INDXUs'RY. While the energy intensity of the industrial sector has deciined by 8% during the
1 980s, mostly as a result of the slower growth of energy-intensive industries, such as steel, aluminum and
fertilizer, and the phasinig out of somne energy-intensive technologies in the manufacture of cement and
fertilizer, the industrial sector continues to account for more than half of India's commercial energy
consumption, and, in terms of its energy intensity, India's industrial sector ranks near the top among
dc'veloping countries and well above the average among industrial countries. Several factors account for
the high energy intensity and r..atively inefficient use of energy in the industrial sector:
(a)  Since Independence, India has pursued an industrial development strategy whose main
objective was to reduce India's dependence on imports. Consequently, large investments
were made in the 1960s and 1970s in basic energy intensive industries such as steel, cement,
aluminum, fertilizers, heavy chemicals, refineries, etc. All of these industries are highly
energy-intensive and absorb a considerable share of indigenous energy production.
(b)   Many of these industries still use technologies and equipment which were developed at a
time when energy was cheap. By toc.iy's standards, most of the machinery, equipment and
infrastructure is outdated and energy-inefficient. To achieve self-sufficiency, the Govern-
merit has encouraged the design of indigenous technologies and development ef a capital
goods industry. Protected from international and internal competition through high import
tar,ffs and extensive regulat ry controls, this inuu,try has few incentives to provide Indian
industrial enterprises with energy efficient capital (oods.
(c) EInergy efficiency improvements require replacement of capital stock, process modifications,
retrofits and technology changes, all of which require large new investments. The scarcity of
capital ar,d the high cost of importing new technologies in the face of a worsening balance of
payments situation continue to put the brakes on the adoption of energy efficient technolo-
gies and the shift towards less energy-intensive industries. In addition, a growing domestic
demand for manufactured products makes expansions of capacity more financially attractive
thani cost cutting through efficiency improvements.
(d)  Another disincentive for improving energy efficiency has its roots in the widespread use of
'cost plus pricing' in India. This is still the most widely used approach by the Government
for setting prices of goods and services that fall under an administered price regime. While
the number of goods and services under administered price regimes has declined gradually
in recent years, they are now used mainly to price the goods and services of pubil. sector
enterprises that face little intemal or external competition. To provide some incentives to
these enterprises to raise their overall efficiency, the Government has, over the years, intro-
duced pricing formulas that contain 'rewards' and 'penalties' for achievement or non-
achievement of agreed efficiency targets. This has encouraged some reduction in the waste-



-3 -
ful use of energv. However, the effectiveness of these incentives has been blunted by the
Government's willingness to provide financial support to 'sick' industries in order to prevent
the closure of large enterprises aiid the loss of jobs. Price incentives for using energy effi-
ciently are also undermined by the fact that protective import tariffs raise the pt ixes of final
products and thus lower the relative cost of energy. Thus, in spite of the fact that many
energy prices laced hy industrial conaumers are more or less in line with ec:onomic prices
(the price of rnost petroleum products used by the industrial sector are at or above border
prices and electricity prices faced by industry are also close to the estimated long run mar-
ginal cost . they do not result in efficiency improvements.
(e)   Another objective of India's economic development strategy, which contributed to the
relatively high eneigy intensity of the economy, was the decision to ensure that all parts of
the country shat equitably in the benefits of developmenrt. To achieve this objective, the
Government ens,red, thtough its public investnents that economic activities and in particu-
lar, industries that provided employrnent were set up fairly evenly spread across the coun-
try. To supply these industries with energy an extensive energy supply system based on
thermal power generation using coal, India's most abundant commereial energy resource,
had to be set up. In thermnal power generation only a small share (between 25% - 40%) of the
fuel used (coal, fuel oil, natural gas, etc.) is convertpd into electric energy. The remainder is
lost in the conversion process. These 'conversion losses' together with transmission and
distribution losses contribute significantly to the energy intensity of the economy.
(f)   The Govemment's location policy and the resulting need for an energy supply system based
on coal fired thermal power has contributed to the growth in the demand for middle distil-
lates. Most of the coal deposits are in the eastem and central parts of India. About 70% of all
coal is shipped by rail mostly to power and industrial plants that are spread fairly evenly
across the country. The surge in energy demand during the 1980s has strained the capacity
of the railways to move coal. This has contributed to disruptions in coal supply, which in
turn has encouraged investrnents in 'captive' power generation using primnarily middle
distillates. Since the railways have been replacing steam locomotives with diesel driven
electric locomotives   even though steam locomotives were more cc st efficient -- their
demand for oil products has increased sharply.
1.08        TRANSIPORT. The steep increase in energy consumption during the 1980s is partly due to the
growing demand for energy in the transport sector. This s-ctor accounts for about one-fourth of total
energy consumnption in India. While its overall energy intcensity has declined with the shift from rail to
road transport (mainly because of under-investment in the railway system), its need for oil products, in
particular diesel oil, has increased dramnatically. The current designs of indigenously manufactured trucks
and cars are highly energy inefficient and the relatively high average age of the truck fleet (more than 40%
of the truck fleet is 12 years old or older) contribute to the high energy intensity of transport.
1.09         AGRICULTURE. Of all major sectors of the economy, agriculture shows the steepest increase in
energy intensity, mainly for two reasons: (a) to increase productivity and (b) provide a butfer against
droughts and floods resulting from the unpredictable behavior of monsoons. Expansion of the use of high-
yielding wheat and rice varieties have increased the demand for (energy-intensive) fertilizer and irriga-
tion. Subsidized electricity has led to a sharp increase in the number of electric pumpsets. Together with
increased mechanization they have contributed to the rapid growth in the demand for electricity and
petroleum products in the agriculture sector. To protect agriculture against the vagaries of the monsoo-,
the Government has encouraged the expansion of irrigated areas. As a result of these efforts, it takes now
twice the amount of energy to produce an average unit of agricultural output (for example, a ton of wheat)
than it did fifteen years ago.

Energy Conservation
1.11          l'o eliminate the wasteful use of energy continues to be a major objective of the
Government's energy strategy. Stidies carried out by the Government cstiinate that, through better

Constraints to Expanding Indigenous Energy Production
1.14        As noted in the section above, efforts to manage energy demand have been largely ineffec-
tive to late. Even if implemented successfully in th( future, energy conservation will not fully substitute
for the need to expand indigenous energy production to close the widening energy gap. In order to assess
the potential of further developing indigenous resources it is important to first take stock of the energy
resource base of the country and the constraints to further increases of production in the main energy
subsectors.
1.15        ENtcy RESOURCE BASE. Considering the size of its economy and its rapidly growing popula-
tion, India is relatively modestly endowed with energy resources. In spite of allocating almost a third of its
public investment resources to the development of these resources, India depends on oil imports to meet
its domestic energy needs. India does, however, have a wide range of commercial energy resources
including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro-electric potential and uranium. Unfortunately their relative size
does not match the structure of energy demand (Figure 1). India's energy resource base is dominated by
coal. Total coal and lignite reserves are estimated at more than 170 billion tons. Although these reserves
are mostly of low quality, they are India's most important commercial energy resource. India has also a
sizeable potential for the generation of hydro-electric energy, estimated at 100,000 MW, of which up to
now only about 13,000 MW have been developed. Environmental concems, the high cost of, and growing
resistance to, the resettlement of a large number of people, disputes about water rights and financial
constraints make hydro-electric power projects increasingly unattractive. Thus, the power sector prefers to
invest in coal and gas-based thermal power generation. Considering the size of its economy India is
poorly endowed with hydrocarbon resources. Proven and probable reserves amount to about 840 million
tons. At projected consumption levels these reserves will last for about two decades. Th'is, unless explora-
tion efforts succeed in raising the level of reserves, India will need to meet its demand for petroleum
products increasingly through imports. Natural gas may provide some respite in the short run. Natural
gas reserves, which are estimated at 961 Bcrn, would permit India to significantly reduce imports of oil
products. Up to now this effort has been hampered by conflicting policies and insufficient financial
resources. Finally, India also has modest reserves of uranium, which would be sufficient to support a
nuclear power program of about 8000 MW.
1.'6        OIL AND GAs. Oil production has increased dramatically over the past ten years, mainly as a
result of the discovery of Bombay High and its satellite fields during the esily .)70s. These fields now
account for about 65% of indigenous production. Prior to the discovery of Bombay high, the oilfields of

Assam and Gujarat were the only indigenous sources of oil supply. Development of Bombay High drasti-
cally reduced India's dependence on oil imports. However, in 1984/85 oil output from the Bombay High
oilfield reached a plateau. Further production increases will require the use of costly enhanced oil recov-
ery technology as well as substantial investments for the development of the smaller satellite fields. The
Govemment's official projections of crude oil production (51 million tons by 1995/96 and 67 million tons
by 2000/01) indicate that ONGC expects to maintain current levels of self-sufficiency through heavy
investments in enhanced oil recovery, the accelerated exploitation of undeveloped fields, large invest-
ments in oil exploration, and substitution of a significant share of domestic oil products demrand with
natural gas. The Bank's staff is less optimistic. Based on a field-by-field review of oil reserves, the Bank's
staff concluded that indigenous oil production would reach a peak of 42 million tons in 1996/97 and then
gradually decline to about 38 million tons in the year 2000; this projection is based on the assumption that
India's oil companies will face no difficulties in getting the investment resources (including foreign
exchange) they would need and that neither company makes any significant oil discoveries. In case
exploration efforts result in a major oil discovery during the next 2-3 years, production would continue
along the projected plateau postponing the inevitable decline of oil output. The Government's projections
of indigenous oil production assume a significant increase in the pace of developing existing in-place
reserves as well as large additional discoveries in the next few years. Both would require large capital.
Considering the increasingly tight constraints on investment resources, particularly in foreign exchange,
that India's oil companies will most likely face in the years ahead, the Bank's staff recommends that the
Government implement policies that encourage the efficient use of energy and substitution of oil products
with other indigenous energy resources. The proposed project, which would provide the infrastructure for
the use of gas that is currently flared, is in line with this recommendation.
1.17        COAL. Because of its abundance, coal remains the mainstay of the Govemment's energy
strategy. To meet the growing demand for coal, particularly from the power sector, the Government
nationalized the coal industry in the early 1970s. This provided the industry with access to public invest-
ment resources, and allowed Coal India (CIL) to meet the Government's ambitious coal production targets
by channelling most of its investments into open-cast mining. Although coal that can be mined in open-
cast mines in India is of low quality, it has substantially lower production costs than that the higher
quality coal mined in underground mines. Coal India's strategy led not only to a decline in the average
quality of its coal output, but also to a neglect of its labor-intensive underground mines. Freqvent real
increases in the wages of miners, poor labor discipline and low labor productivity have turned most
underground mines into loss-making operations. Hamstrung between the need to meet production targets
and political pressure not to retrench excess labor, CIL's financial performance became dependent on the
magnitude and timing of coal price increases and the allocation of pub!ic resources. In all but four years
CIL closed its accounts with a loss.
1.18        Budgetary constraints will force the Government to sharply reduce its allocation of funds to
CIL, and inflationary pressures will make it more difficult to approve coal price increases. The Govem-
ment will have little choice but to grant CIL the autonomy it needs to operate as a commnercial coal com-
pany, and to create a poli-y environment that would attract private investment into an industry that is so
vital for the growth of the Indian economy.
1.19        ELECrRIC POWER. With the emphasis on self sufficiency and a policy of balanced regional
growth, the electric power sector plays a key role in meeting the energy needs of the Indian economy. Not
only is electricity the prime input into industries dispersed all over the country, a large effort to expand
rural electrification to substitute for oil products has further increased the demand for electric power.
Total installed capacity is currently 62,000 megawatts (MW). Additions to capacity have been made at an
average growth rate of 10 % per annum, but demand for electricity has continued to outstrip supply by
10-12 %. Low capacity utilization, transmission losses, institutional bottlenecks and an inefficient pricing
structure which results in inadequate returns and disincentives to conservation have contributed to
financial constraints and a widening power gap. Power shortages have adverse implications for the



-7-
growth of the economy rendering production capacities idle and also 'or ring power users to resort to
investments in captive power plants which increase the demand for oil products. In view of tl.e current
budgetary constraints, it is unlikely that the gap between power demand and supply will be reduced from
the current level of 12-15%. More importantly, the deficit between 'peaking demand' and generating
capacity will widen significantly. The Government has essentially two options. -,,~ and hydro-electric or
thermal power generating capacity.
1.20        Hy'Vo-ELECFRIC POWER. India has one of the largest untapped hydroelectric generating
resources in the world. However, development of this potential, which is estimated at close to 100,000
MW, faces considerable environmental and tinancial constraints. The long gestation periods, high capital
costs and implementation delays have deterred investment in hydro power and the share of hydro power
in the total currently installed capacity is only 25%. While the Govemment has continued to emphasize
the need for developing more hydro electric -.ower, especially in view of the severe shortages in peaking
capacity, budgetary and financial constraints have encouraged a shift away from hydro electric power to
shorter gestation, lower capital cost, coal-based thermal power generation.
1.21        TFERMAL POWER. Most of the existing thermnal power generation capacity is based on coal. In
light of the vast resources of coal, the shorter construction period for thermal power stations than that of
hydro-electric plants, and the locational flexibility of thermal plants wherever access and water facilities
are sufficient, the Govemment has increasingly invested in coal based thermal power. This investment has
not been without cost. High conversion losses, high costs of transporting low quality coals over long
distances, high transmission losses, the firing up and idling of boilers to meet peak demand using large
quantities of expensive fuel oil, and growing environmental costs of burning high ash coal are raising the
cost of coal-based power generation and reducing its attractiveness as the premier option t3 meet India's
rapidly growing energy demand. Gas- based combined cycle plants, which have lower energy conversion
losses and shorter gestation p2riods than even coal plants, have been limited to areas near gas fields.
Energy Prospects for the 1990s
1.22        Table 1.1 summarizes the prospects for the growth of energy demand and supplies during
the 1990s. Oil production will be constrained by the growing scarcity of foreign exchange and the need to
shut-in an increasing number of oil wells with a high gas/oil ratios. The Bank's staff doubts that India's oil
companies will be able to attain, under these circumstances, the Government's production target of 67
million tons by the end of the decade. In addition, the financial constraints and environmental pressures
confronting the power and coal subsectors will most likely sharply reduce the expected growth of their
respective outputs.
The Government's Energy Strategy
1.23        With the widening gap between energy demand and supply, and tight resource constraints,
the Government needs to rethink its strategy of relying wholly on increasing indigenous supply. In the
past, the energy sector has absorbed as much as 30% of total Plan outlays. It is unlikely that the Govern-
ment can afford to increase this share. On the other hand, increasing oil imports will place a heavy burden
on the balance of payments. Under these circumstances the Government is faced with a limited range of
options to bridge the widening gap between energy demand and indigenous energy supplies.
1.24        ENERGY CONSERVArON. The first option is to contain the growth of energy demand. This can
only be done through a concerted effort at energy conservation, reducing the energy consumption of the
highly energy intensive industrial, agricultural and transport sectors. While the Government is now
dedicating more resources to energy conservation efforts, the sheer magnitude of the problem and the
structural changes required indicate that it will be some time before any impact on demand will be felt,

1.25          COMMEIRC'JAI. ORIEN71 ATION. In addition to using energy efficiently, there is a pressing need to
improve the efficiency of the existing energy supply infrastructure and the p;ublic sector companies in the
energy sector. Ihe Government needs to implement drastic institutional and pricing reforms to allow the
oil, gas, coal and power industries to operate along commercial lines. The resulting increase of internally
generated resomrces would make these industries less dependent on budgetary resources.
1.26          INCEASED INVOVI.VI .MENT OF TIHE PRIVATE SECTOR. In view of the tight budget constraints, the
Government is now looking towards the private sector to mobilize additional resources, particularly in oil
exploration and power generation. In oil exploration, the Government is planning to again invite (fourth
round) bids trom international oil companies and the Indian private sector for exploration and develop-
ment of oil and gas fields in India. The Government is also initiating policies to attract private sector
participation in the power sector, particularly in coal and gas based thermal generation.
1.27          ACci.EFRATI ED DlviELoPMFKI OF INDIGENous ENERGY REsoukcEs. The overriding objective of the
Government's energy strategy will remain the full development of India's indigenous energy resources, in
particular its natural gas resources to meet the increasing shortage of energy supplies and reduce the need
for oil imports. The current project aims precisely at providing the requisite infrastructure to reduce
wasteful flaring of associated gas and optimal utilization of both associated and free gas resources in the
country.
11. THE NATURAL GAS MARKET
2.01          Although India's reserves of natural gas are small compared to its reserves of coal and its
hydroelectric potential, natural gas is playing an increasingly important role: gas takes some of thc
pressure of the demand for oil pioducts (fuel oil, naphtha and kerosine); it also reduces the demand for



-9 -
coal, particularly in India's Westem Region, which is farthest away from the main coal producing areas -n
India; it helps to reduce India's widening energy gap at a time when oil and coal production fall short of
production targets; finally, its use contributes significantly to the reduction of environrmental pollution,
which is particularly severe in t' e highly industrialized Western region. This chapter provides an over-
view of India's 'associated' and 'free' gas resources, the likely demand for gas and the steps the Govemn-
ment has taken to eliminate the flaring of gas and ensure that available gas supplies are used efficiently
(e.g. gas utilization and gas pricing policies).
Development of India's Gas Resoutrces
2.02         Natural gas has been produced in India for many years jointly with oil in Assam. However,
apart from a small amount used for internal consumption by the oil company (Oil India Ltd.), most of this
gas was flared. In the rnid-1960s ONGC began to explore systematically for oil all over India. Although
the main thrust of ONGC's exploration efforts was directed at finding oil, these efforts led to the discovery
of several free gas fields: the Cambay Basin (in the State of Gujarat) in 1960, the giant Bombay High oil
field (about 160 kilometers north-west of Bombay) in 1974, the Krishna-Godavari basin (in Andra Pradesh)
in 1985 followed by the discovery of oil and gas in the offshore Ravva field in 1987; the Cauvery Basin (in
the State of Tamil Nadu) in 1989. When oil discoveries were put on production, the 'associated' or 'solu-
tion' gas, which is unavoidably produced with the oil, was for the most part flared. Although the main
thrust of ONGC's exploration efforts was directed at finding oil, these efforts led to the discovery of
several free gas fields.
Gas Reserves
2.03         Gas is found in India mainly in four widely separated regions, the Northeast (Assam,
Tripura), the eastem region (Krishna-Godavari), the south-east (Cauvery), and the western region (Bom-
bay off-shore, Cambay and Rajastan). India's gas reserves are estimated at 961 billion cubic neters (Bcm).
They consist of 320 Bcm of associated and solution gas and 641 Bcm of free gas. More than 50% of these
reserves are located in the Bombay Offshore area. Up to now about 150 Bcm of gas have been produced, a
large part of which has been flared. This quantity represents about 13% of the original recoverable gas
reserves, whereas 32% of the original recoverable reserves of oil have been produced.

2.04        REGIONAL DlsrTIBunON OF GAS RESERVES. Since gas contains much less energy than oil (on a
volure basis), it is expensive to transport; gas is also difficult to store; and the need to maintain a ctertain
pressure in the pipeline system requires close coordination between gas producers and users. In the gas
industry, this close link between producer, gas transmission and distribution company and users, fre-
quently referred to as the 'gas chain', res .nbles the relationship between power generating companies,
transmission and distribution companies and the users of electricity. Since about 90% of ONGC's gas
reserves (Table 2.1) are located close to the highly industrialized western and northwestern regions, whose
energy needs are met primarily through coal, there is a strong incentive to develop these gas resources.
2.05        The situation is somewhat different in the north-eastern region, which has the second
largest reserves. There are two separate gas producing areas in this region: the oilfields of Assam and
Arunachal Pradesh and the free gas fields in the land-locked state of Tripura. Assam has oil and coal
resources that far exceed its own requirements, and companies find it difficult to mnarket all the associated
gas. Unlike in the western region, oil companies in Assam have little incentive to develop free gas re-
serves. Although gas is the major source of commercial energy in the State of Tripura, the local demand is
too small and major gas markets are too distant to justify at present the development of the gas resources
that have been discovered there.
2.06        1he lack of remunerative gas markets has been the major disincentive for oil companies to
explore more aggressively for gas. There is widespread agreement among geologists that future discover-
ies will most likely consist of gas fields. A rapi -ly growing demand for oil and balance of payments
consideration will remain the driving force behind ONGCs and OIL's all-out efforts to explore for oil. The
relatively low prices producers receive for gas encourage this. Gas goes a long way towards replacing oil
products and coal. In setting producer prices for oil and gas, the Government needs to carefully weigh the
cost of encouraging oil exploration in areas that would yield high cost oil against the benefits of exploring
for low-cost gas resources.
Reasons Behind the Extensive Gas Flaring
2.07        India is not taking full advantage of gas resources that are currently available. Current gas
reserves could sustain a production of 90 million cubic meters per day. Yet, in 1990, India produced only
slightly more than half of that (53.2 MMCMD). Only two-thirds of the gas produced was actually used
one-third of the total gas production was flared (Annex 2.2). The substantial gas flaring has been caused
by a number of factors, explained in the following paragraphs. These factors fall into two broad categories:
technical factors which have their roots in decisions related to the development of oilfields and a number
of institutional factors that have slowed the development of gas markets in India.
2.08        GAS FLARINC IN Tn E BOMBAY HIGH OILFIELD. The reason for the sudden increase in flaring gas
during the 1980s lies principally in the production history of the Bombay High oilfield. The reasons are
various, some connected with the nature of the oil reservoir rock and somne attributable to the production
regime of the field.
2.09        The reservoir rock is a fossil reef limestone which contains highly permeable layers interca-
lated in a much less permeable matrix. Originally all the reservoir rock layers were saturated with the
same fluids, but in the course of oil production pressure differentials developed within the reservoir and
the more permeable zones acted as conduits to bring gas and water towards the producing wells, bypass-
ing the oil in the less permeable sections of the reservoir. This problem was compounded by an overall
reservoir pressure drop resulting from an increase of oil production rates not being compensated ad-
equately by injection of water into the reservoir below the oil/water contact, as envisaged in the original
production plan. The water injection plan was initiated too late and on an inadequate scale.



- 11 -
2.10        The problem was further compounded by well drilling and completion techniques em-
ployed in the wells. These permitted the presence of channels and voids in the current layer surrounding
the oil well casing pipe, so permitting the vertical migration of fluids up and down behind the casing.
Since fluid flow in an oil reservoir is influenced by pressure differentials in the reservoir rather than by
gravity, this permitted the most mobile fluids, gas and to a lesser extent water, to be drawn towards the
producing section of the well. Thus, some of the free gas from the gas cap has also been produced with the
oil.
2.11        The net result of all these effects has been a dramatic rise in the gas/oil ratio from the
producing oil wells. The natural solution gas volume in the reservoir was 90 cubic meters of gas to one
cubic meter of oil (GOR 90 v/v). In the north half of the field, at the start of water injection the GOR was
175 v/v, and by April 1990 it had risen to 520 v/v. In the southem part of the field the producing GOR
was 150 v/v until the end of 1985. Water injection conmmenced in 1987, out by the end of 1989 the GOR
had risen to 360 v/v. Some wells were producing with a GOR in excess of 1000 v/v, and ONGC has now
taken a decision to shut in such wells in order to avoid dissipating reservoir energy. In 1990 the Bombay
High field produced overall 20.1 million tons 3f oil and 9.7 Bcms of gas at an average GOR of 400 v/v.
Since the existing gas pipelines from Bombay High field can handle only 16.5 MMCMD as compared with
an associated gas production of 26.5 MMCMD in 1990, the balance (minus the amount used for in-field
use) is flared.
2.12        Remedial action being taken by ONGC consists of shutting in wells with high GORs,
drilling of work-over wells with high permeability zones in the reservoir and voids behind the casing in
attempt to seal them off and accelerated installation of water treatment and reinjection facilities. As a
result of these efforts ONGC has reduced associated gas production, although at the coti of a reduction of
oil production; as ONGC continues its strategy of containing excessive gas flaring by shutting in wells
with a high gas/oil ratio, oil output will continue to decline correspondingly.
2.13        LAcx OF PiPE NE NETuWORK. Despite huge investments in the development of offshore gas
projects, India still has a relatively inmmature gas pipeline infrastructure. Until the early 1980s little at-
tempt was made to construct a pipeline network for gas distribution. There are two reasons for that. Until
the mid-1980s the volume of gas (associated as well as free gas) available from the Bombay offshore area
was vastly underestimnated. When it became apparent during the late 1980s that gas could play a signifi-
cant role in reducing energy shortages in the Western region and take some of the pressure off the balance
of payments, the Govemment could no longer mobilize the foreign exchange required for these invest-
ments.
2.14        SLOW EXPANSION OF MARKJES OR GAS. In addition to the unexpected increase of associated gas
in the western offshore area and the lack of pipelines for the transmission and distribution of gas, the
Govemment paid little attention to the timely development of markets for the gas. As mentioned in the
introduction to this chapter, the efficient use of gas resources requires close coordination between gas
producers and consumers, (costly) investment infrastructure facilities for the transport of gas and institu-
tional arrangements that encourage the expansion of the gas market in line with potential production.
Apart from establishing a national gas marketing company, GAIL, which was initially preoccupied with
the construction of the HBJ gas pipeline, the Govemment did little to encourage the growth of gas mar-
kets. Poor coordination between gas producers ONGC, GAIL and najor potential gas consumers, the lack
of a clear policy that would spell out how the conflicting demands on gas resources by major interest
groups, such as the fertilizer and power industries, should be resolved and the lack of a pricing policy for
gas were the main factors that slowed the growth of gas markets. They will be discussed briefly in the
remaining paragraphs of this chapter together with steps that have or will be taken by the Government to
resolve these issues.



- 12-
2.15        POOR COORDINA110N BE1WEFN PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS. Efficient use of gas requires careful
coordination of plans for the production and the use of gas. This coordination is particularly critical in the
case of associated gas, where the option for suppressing its supply are usually limnited. After all, the
supply of associated gas is determined by the demand for oil and, unless reinjection of associated gas is
feasible, it has to be either used or flared. While some efforts were made in the Planning Commission in
the context of the preparation of the Seventh Five-Year Plan to ensure that tho gas supplies projected by
ONGC and OIL would be fully allocated to specific consumers, there was no institutional mechanism in
place that allowed the Planning Commission to change these allocation plans, in case more (or less) of the
projected volume of gas became available or designated consumers failed to use their gas allocations. The
Government has agreed to set up a body ('Gas Coordination Committee9) in the Department of Petroleum
and Natural Gas that will monitor quarterly the implementation of oil and gas field developments and
revise gas production plans accordingly; it will also monitor quarterly the progress in construction of
plants and other facilities (pipelines, gas processingfacilities, etc.) required for the offtake of gas. This
body will issue a quartcrly report, in which it will list any deviation from the plans of gas producers and
potential consumers. This report will also contain recommendations for steps that would need to be
taken to ensure the efficient use of projected gas supplies. Copies of these reports would be submitted to
the Bank for comments . The Bank's staff recommended that greater consideration should be given in the
future to retrofitting existing industrial plants to burn gas, preferably on a dual-fuel, interruptible basis. In
most other developing countries conversion has been a major early factor in the development of gas
markets. Conversion has the advantages of short lead times, little capital requirenent and establishment
of dual-fuelled plants providing future demand flexibility. Benefits in terms of reduced oil imports are
substantial. Increased attention to conversion and dual firing in power and industry in India could greatly
improve the efficiency of offtake in the short and medium term. This would give GAIL much needed
flexibility in coping with supply and demand fluctuations, quite apart from the environmental benefits
which would accrue as a result of such a policy. This would obviously require construction of a secondary
gas distribution system along the HBJ pipeline.
2.16        UNCLEAR GAS USE PoucIy. Until the late 1970s oil companies sold gas to consumers in the
vicinity of oilfields at whatever price the market would bear. The completion of the gas pipeline from
Bombay High to Uran in 1978, following upon the discovery of the large reserves of South Bassein two
years previously, led to an examination of gas use options by the Govemment. In 1979 a committee
recommended that butane and propane (C3/C4) fractions be separated for liquefied petroleum gases or
bottled gas (LPG) use, and the ethane and butane (C2/C3) fractions be used for petrochemical feedstock.
The methane (Cl) fraction (about 80% of the total) was to be used as fertilizer feedstock, where it would
substitute for naphtha. Use for power generation was rejected in view of the availability of domestic coal
at prices competitive with the high oil prices prevailing at that time. The economics of fertilizer produc-
tion, which favor location of plants close to consuming areas, and the desire to spread the benefits of
offshore gas to states other than Maharashtra, led the committee to reconmmend that the bulk of gas should
be allocated to fertilizer plants in the Westem and Northern states. To supply these plants, the 1300 km
Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline was constructed to take gas through Gujarat and Rajasthan
to Uttar Pradesh. During the 1980s the Government's gas utilization policy shifted towards broader uses
for gas, for power and liquid fuel replacement in industry. This change of policy was due to a perception
that gas availability would exceed the requirements of the fertilizer sector, and to the increasing attraction
of combined-cycle power plants for reducing India's power shortages, particularly in regions away from
the coalfields in the eastern part of the country. It was decided to construct eight combined cycle power
plants, with total capacity of 1500 MW along the HBJ gas pipeline.
2.17        The decision to give priority to fertilizer plants in the allocaticn of gas has resulted in a
substantial underutilization of the capacity of the HBJ pipeline and the full development of the South
Bassein (free) gas field. Two distinct reasons lie behind the shortfall in gas demand along the HBJ pipeline:



- 13-
(a)  Construction of three of the six fertilizer plants planned in the early 1980s has only started
very recently. This has been due to the delays in the authorization process and to changes in
the fertilizer pricing system after authorization of the plants, which reduced the profitability
of fertilizer production causing the plant's sponsors to delay investments.
(b)  The two combined cycle power plants located along the HBJ pipeline have been unable to
operate at base load as originally planned, because the higher unit cost of power from new
gas-based combined cyclc plants has made it difficult for the National Thermal Power
Corporation to sell their electricity to the SEBs. SEBs can purchase base-load power more
cheaply from older coal-fired thermal power plants.
2.18        In March 1990, the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a paper outlining the
Government's policy for allocating gas to consumers. The paper recognizes that the gas market in India is
heavily dependetit on fertilizer production, power generation, and relatively large commitments to new
metallurgical plants producing sponge iron by direct reduction of iron ore. The paper contains the follow-
ing specific recommendations for the use of gas:
(a)  first priority is given to the elimination of gas flaring, except where flaring cannot be
avoided due to technical reasons, and the extraction of LPG and other gas fractions. Thus,
the following statements refer to lean gas or methane (C1);
(b)  to ensure that existing gas resources are fully used, the paper recommends the adoption of a
time-bound gas utilization plan and the signing of gas contracts well in advance of the actual
use of the gas;
(c)  where competitive claims on gas resources require a decision on gas allocation, this decision
should be based on the imputed value of gas; the user with the higher imputed value should
receive the allocation;
(d)  preferenre should be given to the allocation of gas to the power sector. The rationale for this
recommendation is based on India's persistent power deficit, and the fact that, unlike
fertilizer where imports are likely to be less expensive than domestically produced fertilizer
for the foreseeable future, power cannot be imported. However, gas should not L allocated
to base-load power plants unless these plants are located in areas far away from coal mines.
In the allocation of gas to base-load power plants, associated gas should be used first. Power
plants that generate power for peaking purposes could use free gas, since there is greater
flexibility in adjusting gas supplies from these fields.
(e)  in the decision on the development and use of gas resources priority should be given to the
use of associated gas; free gas fields should only be developed after firm commitments for
the use of their gas have been received;
(f)  to reduce the risk of delays in the offtake of gas, the Department of Petroleum and Natural
Gas should be authorized to seek commitments for the use of gas that exceeds projected
availabilities by up to 12.5%; contracts for the 'excess commitment' of 12.5% should be on a
'fallback' basis, that is at a discounted gas price. GAIL confirmed that this policy had been
implemented. Its current commitments to potential gas consumers (Table 2.4) exceed pro-
jected gas supplies and offtake by a sizeable margin.
2.19        Overall the policy recommended by the Dep.artment of Petroleum and Natural Gas should
eliminate gas flaring and result in the efficient allocation of gas resources. The Government has agreed
that it will ensure that gas allocations to end-users will be economically efficient; to this end the Govern-

2.20         LACX OF A Ct.rEAR RFSPONSIBILnTY FOR GAS MARKIN. Production, transport, and distribution of
gas is entirely in the hand of state organizations, mainly OCNGC, OIL and GAIL. Gas supplies are allocated
administratively by the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Until recently both the producing
companies, ONGC and OIL, and GAIL were allowed to sell gas to final consumers. To ensure the orderly
matching of supply and demand, and the consistency of demandfrom established plants, the Government
has decided to streamline all marketing activities and transfer the sole responsibility for the marketing of
gas in India to GAIL. This decision greatly strengthens GAIL's role as a gas marketing company, bringing
their operations closer into line with gas marketing companies in industrial countries. Apart from elimi-
nating inefficiencies in the marketing of gas, this decision will make it easier to implement the recommen-
dations of the Gas Coordination Committee (para. 2 15), which will be set up in the Department of Petro-
leum and Natural Gas.
Gas Production Prospects
2.21         In terms of well head gas production, India ranks among the leading gas producing devel-
oping countries (Table 2.2). The Government's current plans call for the full development of the remaining
discovered gas resources during the 1990s, which will lead to a substantial increase in gas availability in
the medium term. Expected gas production in India's major gas producing region, the Western offshore
area, is shown in detail in Annex 2.1. Table 2.3 which summarizes these projections, shows that associated
gas production will decline fairly rapidly after the year 2000. The significance of these figures can be
appreciated when it is realized that 1000 cubic meters of natural gas have approximately the sante calorific
value as one ton of oil, for which it can substitute in power stations, industrial steam raising, process heat,
etc. Natural gas can also substitute for coal used for these purposes. Given that the greatest reserves of gas
are in the west of India, whereas the coal fields are nearly all in the east, the substitution of gas for coal
can lead to substantial economic and environmnental benefits.

Gas Utilization
2.22        The increase in gas supplies as a result oi the project will be used in three regional markets:
(a)  the Bombay market served by the Uran terminal. This market serves a varied base of fertiliz-
ers, power and industry close to the terminal at Uran, with substantial potential demand
arising from Bombay's concentration of heavy industry;
(b)  the Gujarat market served both from the terminal a' Hazira and from the ortshore Gujarat
fields. This is a diverse market, with a number of large power and fertilizer customers, and
some 50 small industrial users; and
(c)  the Northern market se-ved by the HBJ gas pipeline. The primary users along the gas
pipeline will be power and fertilizer plants as well as industrial users.
Annex 2.3 provides a detailed overview of the current pattern of gas allocations and projected gas use in
the three gas markets served by the project. It also contains a review of the status of implementation of
projects that have received gas allocations and are expected to come on stream over the next five ye rs.
Table 2.4 summarizes this information.
2.23        TtuF BOMBAY MARKET. Bombay is one of the more industrialized arees of India, and gas is
consumed by power stations, fertilizer and petrochemical plants. The market for gas in Bombay is pro-
jected to expanc to 16 MMCMD by 1995, partly due to increasing consumption by existing consumers and
partly to the construction of new petrochemical and metallurgical plants. This market has a large energy
deficit, and the Bank's staff agrees with GAIL's expectation that all allocated gas supplies will be utilized.
2.24        THlE GUJARAT MARKET. This market, which is centered around the Hazira gas terminal,
receives gas from oil fields in the western region. The demand for gas in this market is dominated by
fertilizer and power plants, and some 50 industrial users. In general this is an energy-deficient region, and
since gas will be sold at 'landfall prices', the Bank's staff expects that there is only a small risk that there
will be significant shortfalls in the offtake of the gas supplies a,located to this marke..
2.25        TinE NoR11iaLN MARKET. ThM HBJ gas pipeline has currently a capacity of 20 MMCMD. With
additional compression and some 'looping', this capacity can be increased to 33.5 MMCMD. At present,
plants along the HBJ gas pipeline use barely 9 MMCMD. Some of the reasons for delays in the offtake of
gas have been listed in paras 2.08 - 2.16. GAIL charges consumers along the pipeline an additional fee of
Rs 850 per 1000 m3. 'Te National Thermal Power Corporation has pointed out that it cannot sell power
generated in combined cycle power stations to SEBs at prevailing power tariffs and the higher gas prices
along the HBJ gas pipeline. Offtake of gas along the HBJ poses a serious marketing risk for gas. This risk
has been further heightened by the growing scarcity of investment resources, which may delay the
completion of projects along the HBJ gas pipeline. The Bank's recommendation to set up a monitoring
body in the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas (para. 2.15) makes it possible for the Goven.ment
to redirect gas supplies to the Gujarat market in a timely manner. If there ar,. clear indications that the gas
supplies allocated to users along the HBJ are not utilized, the Governrment and GAIL wi'l have to rethink
their gas marketing strategy for the western offshore region, and address the constraints that prevent the
marketing of a larger share of gas supplies in the Bombay areai.
Gas Pricing
2.26        The Government's pricing policy for gas remains a key factor in the successful and timely
development of gas markets. Gas pricing is a highly controversial issue. The Government has informally
discussed the various options for pricing of gas with the Bank. The policy that is currently before the
Cabinet is in line with the Bank's recommendations.

2.27           ThiEORT ICAL CONSIDERAIONS. Gas prices have three important functions: (i) to provide an
incentive to consumers to use gas efficiently, (ii) to encourage the optimal level of investments in potential
gas-using industries, and (iii) to stimulate exploration and development of gas resources. While nearly ali
commodity prices have these functions, the physical link between gas producers and consumers (gas
chain') makes it difficult to determine gas prices under 'free market conditions'. The situation is similar to
the pricing of &c'ctric power. The physical link between the producer (power generating company), the
transmission and distribution companies, and consumers reduces the number of altemative sources of
supply and thus encourages monopolistic pricing practices. This risk is considerably smaller in many
industrial countries where gas producers have the option to sell their gas to several gas companies, while
gas companies have the option of buying gas irom a number of producers; and, consumers have the
option to switch to alternative fuels. In most developing countries, producers have little choice but to sell
their gas to a national gas company and to allow the Government to set prices. Depending on whether gas
supplies exceed detnand or demand exceeds supplies, two different approaches to gas pricing have
emerged. For countries where supplies exceed demand, the long-run marginal cost of gas prm !iction plus
a depletion premium becomes the correct basis for settirng gas prices. For countries, such as india, where
demand is likely to exceed gas supplies for the foreseeable future, the correct pricing basis to achieve the
pricing objectives outlined above is the cost of the marginal replacement fuel. The Government's proposed
pricing principles are in accordance with these principles.
2.28           EVOLULnON OF A PRICING POLI, Y FOR NATURAL GAS. In India gas has historically been vroduced
along with crude oil. Since most such gas, which would otherwise be flared, is sold to consumers on a
cost-plus basis, there has been no pressing need for a comprehensive gas pricing policy. With the i dvent
of larger vohtmes of offshore associated gas from Bombay High, ONGC and the GOI have been moving



- 17 -
more towards replacement pricing over the past few years. As a result, a numTlber of dlifferent pricing
levels have evolved based on contractual arrangements negotiated at different times in different regions ot
the country. For example, on shore associated gas from Gujarat has been pricedi as low as Rs 355 per
1000m3. Although this price is the result of a decision by an arbitration cormnittee, it is indicative of the
low contractual prices ONGC received as a result of the lack of alternative markets for gas at the tinme ot
field development. Offshore associated gas has been priced between Rs 555 and Ks 2,78) pxr l(.Xhrn,
depending on end use. The lower price was for interruptible supplies to power plants, anid thes higher
pnce for guaranteed supplies to fertilizer and industry.
2.29            With the advent of large quantities of free gas (primarily from South Bassein), the Govern-
ment recognized in 1986 that there was a need for a more comprehensive pricing policy. T'hey examined
various policy optioris and eventually adopted the following set of pricing principles:
(a)   the base price of natural gas should be linked to the price of the fuel or fkedstock repliced;
(b)   the price structure should be simple to administer and to underst, nd, and with prices to
users to be uniform along the pipeline, and

(c)   the gas company, GAIL, should earn a fair return on costs. Any surplus would accrue at the
producer end, where the resource rent would be taxed by the Government.
2.30           These policy principles have been formalized into the following set of gas prices announced
in mid-1987:
(i)   gas at landfall points and onshore gas would be sold at Rs 1400 per 1000m3;
(ii)   gas along the HBJ gas pipeline would be sold at Rs 2250 per 1000 m; and
(iii)  in Assam, where associated gas exists in surplus, gas would be sold at Rs 500 to Rs 1000 per
1000m3. Allowances are  Iso made for discounts in the cases of interruptible users, and to
encourage market build-up during the initial years of new fieid development.
2.31           The Government had decided to review gas prices every three years. In 1989 the Govern-
ment asked the Bureau of Industrial Cost and Prices (BICP) to review the existing pricing policy for gas
and, if necessary, recommend changes. In March 1990 the BICP issued its report, in which it proposes that:
(a)   the price paid to producers (ONGC and OIL) should be based on the long-run average
production cost of gas from the South Bassein (free) gas field, and proposed a price of Rs
1500 per 1000 m3. This price should ensure producers a 15% rate of return on investments;
(b)   prices to consum ,rs should be based on the economic cost of the marginal replacement fuel.
The question of ti ie appropriate ga;, price then boils down to the definition of the marginal
replacement fuel. The BICP based its recommcndavion on the assumption that gas should
primnarily be used to replace costly tradeable oil products, wherever this was technica-lly
feasible. Annex 2.4 ..lustrates this approach. It is based on the Govemment's projections of
gas use in the western and northern regions in 1995/96. Table 2.5 illustrates the relative

prices of fuels competing with gas. The BICP decided on fuel oil as the marginal replacement
fuel, and proposed that gas prices to consumers should be brought in line with the cost of
international fuel oil prices. The Govemment has decided to implement this volicy over a
three year period starting July 1, 1991. In the first year gas prices (at landfall points) will be
raised to Rs 1550 per 1000m3; in the second year to Rs 1650 per 1000m3; and in the third year
to Rs 1750 per 1000m3. At the end of the third year gas prices will be raised to Rs 1850 per
10o0m3.
(c)  the committee recommended that Gas Authority of India nimited (GAIL) should be allowed
a margin of RS 850 per 1000m3 for transport and distribution costs. This was the recom-
mended price for all consumers along the HBJ pipeline regardless of distance from the
supply point of the pipeline at Hazira.
(d)  the difference between the producer price and the prices to consumers will accrue to GAIL;
and
(e)  consumers in the North-east (Assam and Tripura) would continue to pay for gas at a rae of
only Rs 600--1000 per 1000m3.
2.32        The proposed gas pricing policy is line with the pricing principles the Bank has recom-
mended. The link between domestic gas prices and international fuel oil prices eliminates much of the
arbitrariness that governs the Govemment's price setting practices by tying the price Indian consumers
have to pay to the international market price of the marginal replacement fuel. The Government has
agreed to discuss any proposals for revisions of this pricing policy with the Bank.
The Role of the Bank
2.33        Bank lending operations in India's , il and gas sector go back to the late 1970s when the
development of ONGC's giant Bombay Hign o,J  i. ld was first undertaken. The projects financed from
Bank loans since then have been successfully c   't eted and have achieved their main objectives. The first
Bank loar helped finance the Bombay High OtnI,-c Development project (Ln. 1473-1N). This was fol-
lowed by the Second Bornbay High Offshore D"' ,.nment project (Ln. 1925-1N), the Krishna Godavari
Petroleurni Exploration project (Ln. 2205-IN) anc aLbe Cambay Basin Petroleum project (LLn. 2403-IN). Then,
with the rapid grow+. of oil production fromr 'torln  y High and the corresponding i sc eased amounts of
associated natural gas along with the large natusa,' .c r-served discovered at South bassein, the Bank
shifted the emphasis u f its support to the naturail g, d ector. A need was foreseen to come to grips with
such critical issues as gas utilization, sector plannin, :..nd gas pricing. The Bank's first lending operation in
the gas sector was to help Finance the South Bassein C. - Development project (Ln.2241-IN); this was
followed by the Westem Gas Development project (I i.J.9)4-IN), which is still under implementation.
2.34        ONGC's offshore operations have grown at akn unprecedented rate and in the process
ONGC has developed into a full-fledged production ol onmpany. Despite its rapid growth ONGC has
been able to train and maintain i competent and dedicated staff. ONGC, however, has one weakness
which greatly detracts from an otherwise creditable perfornance. Its poor procurement performance,
which is also in part due to excessive bureaucratic procedures required by the Government, causes
numerous delays which past experience has shown can add two or more years to the projection comple-
tion date. ONGC has requested ;he Bank's support for effort^:
(a)  to streamline its pro.urement procedures and practices; and
(b)  to provide project management training and guidelines including project coordination.

In parallel with the appraisal of this project, the Bank is working closely with ONGC on the above two
objectives.
2.35        T'i; BANK"' laNDoINC STRArhC;Y. The Bank supports the Covernment's efforts to
(i)  climinate ihe flaring of associated g is;
(ii  to accelerate the development of gas markets in India and ensure that gas is used efficiently;
and
(iii' to tully develop India's gas resources.
Apart from eliminating the wasteful flaring of gas, the most pressing need in the years ahead is develop-
ment of gas markets in line with the existing gas production potential. Thus, in parallel to its ongoing
support for gas projects with ONGC and OIL, the Bank increasingly seeks to support GAIL's efforts to
expand the existing gas mnarkets.
Lessons Learnt From Previous Bank Operations
2.36        Expeiencce with the implemertation of gas projects in India has shown a critical need to co-
ordinate the development of gas fields and gas mnarkets. The excessive flaring of gas in the Bombay High
oilfield is largely the result of delays in the development of gas markets (in particular the identification of
'fall back' consumers) and the lack of investments in pipelines and other infrastructure facilities. To ensure
that gas will be used efficiently under the proposed project, the marketing plans for gas have been re-
viewed with the Gas Authority of India Ltd., fall back plans for the allocation of gas have been drawn up
in case sonme users are unable to utilize their gas allocations and a body will be set up in the Department of
Petroleum and Natural Gas that will monitor progress in the implementation of gas projects as well as of
projects that will utilize gas
2.37        Several projects with ONGC have taken longer to irrnA!ement than anticipated at appraisal.
ONGC's complex decision making structure has been a major cause of these delays. ONGC has requested
the Bank's assistance in streamlining its procurement and project implementation organization.
III. THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION
Introduction
3.01        The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) will be the beneficiary of the proposed
project. ONGC was established by the Government in 1959 as a statutory body to plan, promote, organize
and implement programs for the development of oil and natural gas resources and the sale of oil and
natural gas products. ONGC, which is fully owned by the Government, now shares this mission with
several other publicly-owned corporations. About 10% of India's oil and gas output is produced by Oil
India Ltd. (OIL), whose operations are concentrated in India's northeastem region, mainly Assam, and
Rajasthan. Refining of crude oil and the marketing of oil products is in the hands of six refinery and three
marketing companies. With a market share of almost 50% and six refineries, the Indian Oil Corporation
(IOC) is India's largest refinery and marketing company for oil products. The marketing of natural gas is
in the hands of the Gas Authority of India Ltd. (GAIL). All of these corporations report to the Ministry of
Petrolcum and Chemicals. All major investments in the oil and gas sector have to be approved by the
Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs following a recommendation by the Public Investmer; Board on
which all concerned ministnes as well as the Planning Commission are represented. Decisions on the



-21 -
pricing of oil and gas products are made by the Cabinet based on reLconunenddtions Of the Mfililstrv ef
Petroleum and Chemicals and inter-ministerial consultations.
Organization and Management
3.02        The 1959 ONGC Act provides that the Commission shall coonsist of a Chairmanii and iot les'i
than two, but not more than eight Members. Members are appointed by the Government for ternis not
exceeding five years and are eligible for reappointment. The conmmission sets policies, manages the
activities, and develops plans and budgets for ONGC. All decisions must be approved by a majority of
Members. At present, the Commission consists of the Chairman and six Members from within ONGC and
two Fart-time Members representing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemi-
cals. An Executive committee consisting of the Chairman and the six ONGC Members oversees ONGC's
day-to-day operations.
Institutional Issues
3.03        GREATER MANAGERIAL EFFcCENcY. In 1986, ONGC's oard reorganized the activities of the
Commission along functional lines and regions. The objective of the reorganization was to improve the
operational performnance, raise accountability, and achieve greater coordination between functional
groups. Six regional 'business centers' were established that integrated all activities of each region (Annex
3.1). Each business center is headed by a regional director. Within each business center, staff is organized
along functional lines (e.g., exploration, development) in the form of business groups. ONGC has set up
eight institutes with the aim of providing technical support and training to the staff in the business groups
in each regional center. Each member of the Commission is in charge of one of the regional centers. As a
result of this reorganization ONGC has been in a better position to deal with the strains caused by the
rapid growth of its operations. Over the past ten years, ONGC was able to increase oil output by almost
15% per year while keeping the growth of its staff to 1% per year.
3.04        GREATms AUroNomyc. As a statutory body, ONGC's room for tak"nG decisions is constrained
by Govemment prevailing policies and procedures. In order to reap the full benefits of its efficiency
improvements, ONGC uses Memoranda of Understandings with the Government (MOUs) to define its
responsibilities vis-a-vis the Government, to minimize Government interference in its day-to-day opera-
tions and to accelerate Govemment approvals. ONGC signed the first MOU with the Ministry of I'etro-
leum and Chemicals in 1986. The MOU spelled ou. performance targets and steps the Government was to
take to speed up approvals. Subsequent MOUs extended ONGC's autonomy, and in 1990 the Government
granted ONGC far-reaching autonomy over its foreign exchange budget. ONGC can now spend 75% of its
approved annual foreign exchange budget; the remaining 25% will be released by the Government after
ONGC provides the required detailed information. In many respects, ONGC's autonomy is now compa-
rable to that of other public sector corporations.
3.05        GREATER INVOLVEMENr OF nTE PRIVATE SECrOR. In addition to attaining a greater measure of
autonomy in its decision making, ONGC is relying increasingly on private sector companies for the
expansion of its operations. In addition to contracting out services to Indian and foreign companies which
were originally provided by ONGC's staff, the Government is relying increasingly on international oil
companies in the exploration of oil and gas resources.
3.06        DIvTrErRE. ONGC uses not only the services of existing domestic private and public sector
companies, it also assists former employees in setting up cooperatives and joint ventures with foreign
companies. ONGC's main areas for divestiture involve activities of a highly technical nature. A: presen1t,
there are about 40 privately owned specialized companies of which ONGC uses regularl,y about 25. They
include charter hiring of drilling rigs; helicopter, marine and diving services; operation and maintenance
of installations and vessels; soil investigation, surveys, well logging and production testing. Nlost of these



- 22 -
services were originally procured from foreign sources. Orders to local privately-owned companies have
increased from Rs 1270 million (US$71 million) in 1980/81 to Rs 9,900 million (US$560 million) in 1989/90.
3.07        ROLE OF INTERNATONAL OIL COMPANTES. In the early 1980s, the Govemrnment adopted a policy
of inviting international oil companies to explore for oil on a sole risk basis. Under this arrangement oil
companies commit themselves to a program of exploration work in certain geographical areas. They are
under an obligation to finance and carry out this program within a certain tirne frame, in exchange for a
share of their output if hydrocarbons are found.
3.08        Up to now, there have been three "rounds of offerings of exploration acreage". The first two
rounds mnet only with limnited success. The industry felt that the terms of the production sharing contracts
were not competitive and the blceks offered were not sufficiently prospective. In the first round (in 1980),
the Government offered 15 onshore and 17 offshore blocks. Only four international companies submitted
bids for two blocks and only one contract was signed. In the second round in 1982, the Government
offered eight onshore and 42 offshore blocks. No contracts were signed. For the third round (in 1986/87),
the Government improved the terms of the contracts and offered more prospective areas. Of the 27
offshore blocks that were offered, seven international oil companies submitted 12 bids. A fourth round is
expected to be announced by the Government before August 1991. The contractual termns will be similar to
those of the third round. These terms are in line with international practices. Despite the lack of success of
the three previous rounds, international oil companies appreciate that India is essentially still
underexplored, particularly in technically difficult areas such as the Bay of Cambay, Kutch and the
possible western extension of Bombay High in deeper waters on the continental shelf and slope. The
fourth round should therefore result in a substantial number of bids.
Accounting, Management Information and Auditing
3.09        ONGC keeps its accounts in accordance with international accounting practices. In 1986,
ONGC adopted the successful efforts method of accounting (Annex 3.2) to cost its exploration and drilling
operations - a practice followed by most international oil and gas companies. ONGC's accounting
system, which is computerized, meets the requirements for financial accounting, budgetary control and
cost and mnanagement accounting. ONGC prepares detailed rolling budgets that are largely based on
physical performance targets (million tons of oil produced, meters drilled, etc.) for each of its operating
units. Since achievement of the agreed physical performance targets remains the paramount objective of
ONGC's management, the budget system lacks sufficient orientation towards cost control and improving
efficiency. It also makes it difficult to respond to changing circumstances. ' "anges in performance targets
frequently require ministerial or cabinet approval, particularly when foreign exchange expenditures are
involved, resulting in delays in implementation of corrective measures. ONGC is aware of this and is
introducing changes that will make the budget a more effective tool for enhancing efficiency. Long term
financial planning is currently only carried out in conjunction with the Government's five year plans, but
steps are being taken to prepare rolling five year financial projections on an annual basis.
3.10        Over the past two years, ONGC has built up an elaborate management information system
which makes it possible for management to assess ONGC's operational performance through detailed
monthly reports and other reports. ONGC is in the process of computerizing the system by establishing
satellite linkages between headquarters and its regional centers.
3.11        ONGC's accounts are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
The audit is normally completed by November, after which the accounts have to be submitted to Parlia-
ment for approval. ONGC's internal auditors carry out a continuous audit during the year, while the
Corporate Management Group undertakes management audits on a regular basis. The audit arrangements
are satisfactory. ONGC has agreed that its annual accounts, including the audit report of the special
account and the statement of expenditures for the project, if any, will be made available to the Bank

within nine months of the end of the fiscal year. ONGC has further agreed that it will submit unaudited
financial statements (income statements, funds flow statement and balance sheet) to the Bank within six
months of the end of the fiscal year.
Financial Performance
3.12           The financial performance of ONGC over the past ten years is sunmmarized in Annexes 3.3 -
3.6. An overview of its performance during the past five years is provided in Table 3.1. The table shows
that ONGC's operations grew rapidly during the past ten years. Sales of crude oil increased from 9 million
tons in 1981 to 26 million tons in 1985 and 30 million tons in 1990. Sales of natural gas increased more
gradually from 972 MMCM in 1981 to 8610 MMCM in 1990, an average increase of about 27% a year. Total
revenues increased from Rs 4.5 billion in 1981 to Rs 81.3 billion in 1990, an average increase of 38% a year.
The proportion of oil revenues in total sales has declined from a peak of 88% in 1985 to 78% by 1990.
3.13           ONGC's operating ratio has increased steadily since 1986, and returns on equity and net
fixed assets in operation have declined since 1986. This is to a large extent due to the Government's
decision not to raise ONGCs net retention price of Rs 967.85 per metric ton (mt) of crude oil which has
been aimde at this level since July 1981 in spite of increasing operating costs, rising inflation and a steady
devaluation of the Rupee. Similarly for natural gas the basic price of Rs 1,400 per 1000 m3 has been in
effect since 1985. Taking into account the devaluation of the Rupee over the past ten years, the net reten-
tion price for oil has declined from US$123 per mt (equivalent to US$17 per bbl) in 1981 to US$54 per mt
(equivalent to US$7 per bbl) in 1990. In spite of the lack of adjustments in the producer prices for oil and



- 24 -
gas, ONGC's financial position has remnained sound. All its financial ratios agreed with the Bank under
previously approved loans have been considerably exceeded.
3.14           Since 1984, ONGC's net internal cash generation has exceeded its total capital expenditire.
ONGC's self financinig ratio averaged 82% during the Sixth Five Year Plan (1981-85) and 105% during the
Seventh Plan (1980-90). The high self-financing ratios reflect the rapid growth of oil output from the
Bombay High oilfield, where production costs are lower than in other Indian fields, a reduction of corpo-
rate taxes and ONGC's policy of paying rather modest dividends.
Meeting ONGC's Foreign Exchange Requirements
3.15           ONGC's recourse to long-term borrowings has been dictated by the Ministry of Finance's
requirement that all foreign currency expenditure on capital projects be financed either directly or through
the Government from official sources. Sources, timing and currencies of foreign loans are decided by the
Ministry of Finance to ensure consistency with India's overall borrowing strategy. Currently, about 30 -
40% of ONGC's capital expenditure and 10 - 15% of its cash operating costs require foreign exchange.
These shares have declined over the past few years as a result of ONGC's indigenization policy. Table 3.2
provides an overview of ONGC's sources of finance.
3.16           Over the past ten years, some 42% of ONGC's total foreign exchange requirements (includ-
ing capital expenditures, operating costs and debt service requirements) were met from the country's free
foreign exchange resources. The remaining 58% of the total foreign exchange requirenents were secured
through direct borrowing from foreign private sources or indirectly from loans (mostly from the World
Bank) on-lent to ONGC by the Government. During 1985-90, ONGC's foreign borrowing amounted to Rs
55.4 billion (about US$ 3.2 billion) of which 88% consisted of long term syndicated loans and issues of
securities, both predominantly US Dollar denominated and arranged with the help of US, Japanese and

European private banks and security houses. Such wide market access enabled ONGC to minimnize the
use of tied, market priced financing, such as export and supplier credits. As of March 31, 1990, ONGC's
total direct foreign currency long term debt amounted to Rs 48.1 billion (equivalent to about US$ 2.8
billion at the exchange rate then applicable), of which 71% was denominated in US Dollar and 200% in Yen,
the remainder in other currencies. At the same date, indirect foreign currency debt amounted to Rs 9.3
billion.
3.17        ONGC has sought to insulate itself to the extent possible from the risks associated with its
growing foreign exchange indebtedness; it sought to diversify the currencies in which it borrowed, and
strike a balance between fixed and floating rate borrowings; it also arranged a number of interest rate
swaps. In 1987, ONGC prepaid some loans in order to take advantage of the drop of interest rates in
international financial markets. However, since ONGC has no direct foreign exchange earnings, its
options for using hedging techniques conducive to a more cost-effective liability management are limited.
ONGC's Financial Relationship with the Government
3.18        ONGC's contributions to the Govemment's revenues are substantial. Dunng the Seventh
Plan, ONGC contributed about R.s 16.5 billion to the budget of the Central (Rs 14.5 billion) and State
Govemment (Rs 2 billion) in the form of excise cess, royalties, duties, corporate tax and dividends. The
Government's policy regarding producer prices for oil and gas and ONGC's borrowing strategy have
allowed ONGC to generate substantial Rupee surpluses, which have been used for long term investments
in public sector securities and public sector undertakings. On March 31,1990, the total value of these
investments and loans was about Rs 35 billion (about US$2 billion). It has provided ONGC with substan-
tial additional revenues (Rs 3,870 million in 1990).
ONGC's Operational Performance
3.19        It is difficult to compare ONGC's operational performance with that of other national and
internationial oil companies. Unlike private intemational oil companies, whose main objective is profit
maximization, ONGC's role is more complex. While its primary role is to explore for and develop India's
oil and gas resources, ONGC remains an important vehicle for raising revenues in domestic markets and
foreign exchange loans in intemational financial markets. ONGC has also emerged as a major institutional
investor in non-oil and gas related activities in India. To foster this role, the Government has kept pro-
ducer prices well in excess of ONGC's production costs and, more recently, reduced the corporate tax rate
to compensate for inflation and the devaluation of the Rupee. Administered prices for crude oil and gas
have protected ONqGC from fluctuations of oil prices in international markets and its near-monopoly
position shelters it from competitive pressures. To ensure that ONGC operates efficiently, the Government
monitors ONGC's operations through the physical and financial performnance targets agreed in the annual
MOUs. Annex 3.7 provides a comparison of ONGC's performance in terms of selected cost and other
ratios.
3.20        ONGC's production costs for cTude oil have re-rined well below the import parity price
throughout the 1980s. In 1990, ONGC's average production costs at the wellhead were about US$25 per
ton of oil (US$3.42 per barrel) and US$48 per 1000 m3 of gas. Offshore production costs were US$22 per
ton for oil (US$3.0 per barrel) and US$38 per 1000 m3 of gas. After declining steadily until 1988, ONGC's
production unit costs in 1989 and 1990 and operating expenses in 1990 increased considerably. This was
due to several factors: rising inflation, the devaluation of the Rupee, higher financing costs a less success-
ful exploration program in these years, which increased the level of amortization and ONGC's costly
indigenization policy (para. 3.06). In spite of these cost increases, ONGC's production costs are rough)v in
line with those of oil and gas companies of this size. Its reserve to production ratios of about 22 for oil and
41 for gas remain at acceptable levels.



- 26 -
3.21          There is, however, room for efficiency improvements. With a staff of about 47,000, ONGCs
production of about 17 bbl of oil equivalent/day per employee is relatively low by international stan-
dards. Its average drilling cost has declined to about US$ 541 per meter in 1990 but remains high by
international standards. Continuous involvement of the Bank with ONGC has, over the years, led to
improvements in operational efficiency as well as policy changes with respect to increased involvement of
the private sector. ONGC has recently requested the Bank to review project implementation arrangements
and its reservoir management. As ONGC owns most of its field service equipment, compared to other oil
companies, the Bank has recommended improving efficiency by farming out services to both domestic
and foreign specialized firms. This should lead to a further reduction of drilling cost, although the prefer-
ence of domestic suppliers should be gradually eliminated. The Government's decision to invite interna-
tional oil companies to explore for oil and gas in India will expose ONGC to state-of-the art exploration
techniques and efficient operations, particularly if ONGC enters into a production sharing agreement with
the foreign oil companies. While ONGC's mnanagement favors close interaction with the private sector,
particularly through joint ventures, privatization of ONGC would be politically not feasible. Bank support
for the Government's policy to increase ONGC's exposure to a more competitive environment extpnd its
autonomy and shift the emphasis from attaining quantitative targets to efficiency improvements, would
achieve similar objectives.
Investment Program
3.22          ONGC's level of capital expenditure almost doubled from Rs .58 billion during the Sixth
Plan (1981 - 1985) to Rs 110 billion during the Seventh Plan (1986-1990). Output from the Bombay High
oilfield accounts for about 60% of indigenous oil production output has reached a plateau and will decline
by about 10% a year unilss steps are taken to arrest the decline. ONGC's investment program, therefore,
contains a large financial provision for sustaining oil production action in the Bombay High field. This,
together with the development of recent discoveries, is expected to offset the inevitable decline of produc-
tion from existing fields. Investments during the Eighth Plan (1991-1995) are expected to amnount to about
Rs 200 billion in constant terms (about Rs 222 billion in current terms), of which the proposed project

would represent about 24%. ONGC's investment program is summarized in Table 3.3, and details are
given in Annex 3.8. The bank supports the objectives and strategy reflected in the proposed investment
program. ONGC has agreed to review its investment program annually with the Bank together with the
implications of this program on its financial position.
Financial Prospects
3.23           Over the next five years, ONGC is expected to continue to grow rapidly. Table 3.4 summna-
rizes ONGC's projected financial performance up to 1995. Details are given in Annexes 3.9 to 3.13. The
financial projections are based on the assumption that the retention price for crude oil and gas will remain
unchanged. The projections show that, in spite of rising inflation rates and a gradual devaluation of the
Rupee against the US Dollar and other currencies, ONGC will remain financially viable. However, ONGC
will no longer generate sufficient resources to fully finance its investment program, working capital and
debt service, but it is expected to have sufficient borrowing capacity to supplement its own resources and
to raise foreign exchange. Also, unless the Government decides to raise producer prices, it would need to
divest part of its non-oil related investment portfolio. In order to ensure that ONGC continues to remain
financially viable, ONGC has agreed to maintain its cutrent ratio at 1.2 times or higher, its debt semice
ratio at 1.5 times or higher and its long term debt to equity ratio at not more than 1.5. In addition to the
technical risks associated with oil and gas production, there are, however, a number of factors which
could easily affect ONGC's financial position and its capability to implement its investment program.



- 28 -
First, with the exception of the loans from multilateral donors onlent by the Government, ONGC carries
the foreign exchange risk on most of its long term debt. Its debt profile is rather uneven, and debt service
is projected to double in Rupee terms by 1993 from its 1991 level and to triple by 1994. The Rupee has
depreciated by an average of about 12% against foreign currencies from March to November 1990. An
accelerated devaluation or an increase in local inflation in excess of the rates projected would weaken
ONGC's financial position and may torce the Government to increase producer prices. The second uncer-
tainty relates to ONGC's and the Government's ability to raise foreign exchange.
Financing Requirements
3.24          Table 3.5 shows the estimated financing requirements during the period 1991 to 1995.
During this period, ONGC is expected to maintain an average self-financing ratio of about 78%. In the case
of ONGC, this relatively high level of self-financing is crucial as a cushion against devaluation, inflation
and for maintaining its sound credit rating. It is estimnated that, during the period 1991-1995, ONGC
would need about Rs 203 billion (US$ 9.4 billion) in foreign exchange, about US$ 4.9 billion (52%) to cover
the foreign exchange cost of its capital expenditure program and US$4 billion equivalent (43%) to cover
debt service, the balance (US$ 0.5 billion) being for operating costs. Of this amount about US$110 million
has been already arranged through previous loans and about US$400 million from recent bond issues in
Germany and Japan. An estimated US$2 billion is expected to be arranged in the context of this project.
ONGC plans to raise directly an additional US$3.7 billion (equivalent) from external sources, primarily
from export credit agencies and suppliers. The balance of about US$3.2 billion would need to be provided
by the Government. Given India's need to sustain investments in oil and gas exploration, it is expected
that the Governm ent will give ONGC priority in its allocation of free foreign exchange. There is consider-
able risk that ONGC and the government will be unable to mobilize all of the projected foreign exchange
requirements. If this should happen, ONCC would most likely delay investments in the Bombay offshore
region, particularly in Neelam and Gandhar, and India's oil production would be substantially lower than
currently projected.

3.25         ONGC's external resource mobilization during the 1991-95 period will have to be carried
out und2r substantially less favorable conditions than in the preceding period and its strategy will,
therefore, have to be adjusted accordingly. In the fall of 1990, reacting to India's deteriorating external
position, Moody's revised India's (and ONGC's) credit rating from A2 to BAAL. Other credit rating
agencies soon followed suit. By end-May 1991, S&P's implied rating of India's long-term debt was further
reduccd to BB+. As a result, India's access to external finance has narrowed substantially. Consequently,
ONGC's resource mobilization efforts will have to be directed increasingly towards bilateral development
assistance, multilateral and bilateral institutions as well as suppliers and export credit agencies (ECAs).
The latter sources, which ONGC has tapped in the past only in a limnited way, can still offer substantial
amounts of tied long term credit.
3.26         Apart from the Bank's direct involvement in motilizing the resources for ONGC's invest-
ment program, the proposed project focuses on improving ONGCs overall project implermentation
capabilities, including strengthening of relationships with export credit agencies and other international
financial institutions. The financial covenants are designed to ensure that ONGCs overall financial
viability will be maintained. The growing complexity of ONGCs overall future resource mobilization
requirements (over and above the proposed project) as well as the need to continue its efforts to optimize
its liability management, dictate that ONGC strengthen its capacities in this area. To that end, ONGC has
agreed that it will retain a financial advisor who will develrp the necessary strategic resource mobiliza-
tion and asset and liability management plans for ONGC and assist in their implementation, including
the negotiation of the various cofinancing facilities envisaged in the proposed project.
IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01         The bulk of India's gas reserves is located in its Westem region, one of India's most indus-
trialized areas. Close to 75% of total gas reserves are concentrated in the Bombay offshore area. About
one-third of these reserves consist of associated gas. Unlike free gas, whose production can be controlled
quite easily, the supply of associated gas depends on such factors as the rate of oil production, the geologi-
cal characteristics of the reservoir and the age of the oil field. Most gas consumers prefer a stable and
assured supply. When associated gas cannot be reinjected, oil companies tend to flare it, unless they are
able to identify a market that Is willing to take whatever quantities of gas become available or even out
fluctuating supplies of associated gas with supplies of free gas.
4.02         The Bombay High oil field is India's largest source of oil and associated gas. In 1989/90 it
produced 20 million tons of oil per year and almost 30 million cubic meters (MMCMD) of gas per day.
This corresponds to more than 60% of indigenous oil production and almost 7/0% of total gas production.
ONGC did not anticipate that gas production would increase quite as rapidly, and did not make the
necessary investments for bringing the additional gas supplies ashore. The steep increase in gas supplies
is primarily the result of a drop in reservoir pressure, which was caused by delays in the implementation
of measures, such as water injection, to maintain this pressure.
4.03         To slow the increase of oil imports ONGC has decided to implement a program that would
increase the oil and gas production in the Bombay High oil field and simultaneously eliminate gas flaring.
Under this program, ONGC is currently develuping additional oil production from the L-III reservoir in
the south sector of the Bombay High oil field through infill drilling. This will require drilling of 78 produc-
tion and water injection wells. In addition to the production and water injection wells, to be drilled
through eight well platforms, the program will require additional process platforms with intra-field and
trunk gas pipelines. ONGC estinmates that this will yield an additional 40 million tons of crude oil and 18
billion cubic meters (Bem) of associated gas. The program includes also similar investments to develop the



- 30 -
L-1l reservoir in the northern sector of the Bombay High oil field. This will be achieved by drilling 42
production and water injection wells. In addition to the production and water injection wells, to be drilled
through five well platforms, ONGC plans to install a processing platform, with intra-field gas pipelines, as
well as a gas feeder line to the Bombay High - Uran trunk pipeline. ONGC estimates that these wells will
yield an additional 16.5 million tons of oil and 8 Bcm of associated gas. The Gas Flaring Reduction project
includes those components of ONGC'  wvelopment program for the Bombay High oil field that are
installed primarily for the recovery and transmission of gas that would otherwise be flared.
4.04        PNoJEcr DESI(;N. The basic design of the gas production and recovery components of the
project is based on an optimization study for the Bombay High oilfield, which was carr;-d out by Engi-
neers India l td. (EIL) in 1989. The design of the pipeline system is the result of extensive discussions with
ONGC and the Gas Authority of India Ltd. The least-cost option which calls for taking all the gas that is
being tlared in the Bombay High oilfield to t:le Bombay area market cannot be implemented due to the
limited capacity of the Uran gas terminal which cannot be increased beyond 16 MMCMD. Construction of
another terninal at Usar to process oil and gas is being studied. However such a terminal is likely to face
stiff opposition from environmental groups. In addition, both ONGC and GAIL expect that land acquisi-
tion difficulties would extend the completion of the new terminal well beyond the date at which the
proposed project would remain viable. Thus, ONGC decided to design a pipeline system that would take
the additional gas from the Bombay High oilfield to the other available landfall point, Hazira. From
Hazira the gas will be distributed through the Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline to consumers in
Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradhesh, Harayana and New Delhi. Annex 4.1 describes in more detail the
rationale for the layout of the proposed additional pipeline.
Project Objectives
4.05        The principal objectives of the project are:
(a)  to eliminate the flaring of associated gas in the Bombay High oil ficid, improve the manage-
ment of the Bombay High Reservoir, in order to arrest the decline of oil production and
optimize the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons;
(b)  to reduce energy shortages and improve efficiency of energy use in India's Western Region;
and
(c)  to promote a greater involvement of the private sector in the oil and gas industry in India.
Project Description
4.06        The project is designed to transport up to 25.3 MMCMD of additional gas from the Bombay
High oil field to lJran and Hazira. These facilities will eliminate the flaring of gas in the Bombay High oil
field and help to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the Bombay area and along the HBJ pipeline
in Northwest India. The project includes an additional trunk gas pipeline from South - Bassein to Hazira
and the expansion of the terminal facilities at Hazira. These two components will increase the existing
transmission capacity from Bombay offshore fields, particularly Bombay High and South Bassein, from 32
to 61 MMCMD of gas and will make it possible to segregate the transmission of sweet and sour gas. To
ensure that gas consumers in the Bombay area receive the volume of gas committed to them, the project
also includes a pipeline from the south sector of the Bombay High oil field to the Heera oil field where it
connects with the Heera - Uran trunkline. This additional pipeline will supplement gas deliveries to Uran
by an additional 4 MMCMD. (Figures 1 and 2 in Annex 4.1 show the capacities of the various gas pipe-
lines and the expected flows of gas through the pipeline system over the life of the project).
4.07        The project consists of the following components, described in detail in Annex 4.2:



-31 -
(a) Construction of a process platform, SHG, in the southern sector of the Bombay High oil field
with a processing capacity of 100,000 barrels (bbl) of oil per day, 15 MMCMD of gas and
140,000 bbl of water per day. The platform includes a 78 kilometer (km) pipeline with a
diameter of 28 inchcs to the BPB platform at South - Bassein.
(b) Construction of a process platform, NQP, in the northern sector of the Bombay High oil
field, with a processing capacity of 60,000 bbl of oil per day, 6.8 MMCMD of gas and 90,000
bbl of water per day. The platform includes a 30 km pipeline with a diameter of 18 inches to
the BHN - Uran gas trunk pipeline.
(c)   Modifications of existing platforms.
(d)  Construction of a 142 km gas pipeline, (26 - 36 inches) from the existing process platform,
ICP, in the southern sector of the Bomoay High oil field to the Heera - Uran trunk pipeline.
(e) Construction of a 255 km trunk gas pipeline (42 inches) from South - Bassein to Hazira.
(f)   Expansion of the existing Hazira gas terminal.
(g)  Engineering, project management and other implementation services.
(h)  Implementation of a package of measures, in the Bombay High oilfield, required by proper
reservoir management practices.
(i)   Reservoir performance and management studies and training.
(j)  Implementation of a package of measures to reduce the environmental risks and enhance the
safety of offshore operations.
4.08        The project will substantially increase the availability of gas in the Bombay area, in Hazira
(Gujarat) and along the HBJ gas pipeline, which brings gas from India's west coast to industrial areas in
Rajasthan, Harayana, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. To offset a declire in the availability of associated
gas, the project will give ONGC the flexibility to bring additional free gas from the South Bassein gas field
ashore. This will provide consumers with an assured supply of gas, which will replace naphtha in fertil-
izer production, middle distillates in the generation of peak-load power and coal in base-load power
generation. The project will also contribute to an increase of oil output in the Bombay High oilfield.
Implementation
4.09        ONGC will be responsible for the implementation of the project. During all phases of
project design and implementation, ONGC will be assisted by Engineers India Ltd. (EIL). EIL is the largest
and most experienced engineering firmn in the oil and gas production and processing field in India. EIL, in
tum, has collaboration arrangements with experienced international engineering firms. ONGC requires
that all its offshore structures and facilities, including pipelines, meet international standards and receive
certificates to that effect from recognized certification companies. These services will be provided by
Engineers India Certification Agency.
4.10        The organizational arrangements for the implementation of the project are shown in Annex
43. Because of the large size of the individual project components, ONGC is managing the implementa-
tion of the project in terms of four separate subprojects: (a) facilities in the northern sector of the Bombay
High oilfield; (b) facilities in the southern sector of the field; (c) construction of the pipelines extending
from platform ICP (in the Bombay High oil field), to the Heera oil field and from the South - Bassein gas



- 32 -
field to the Hazira gas terminal; and (d) the expansion of the Hazira gas terminal. Fach of these
subprojects will be headed by a project manager with a separate task force and support services. The
subproject managers of project components (a), (b) and (c) will report to the Officer on Special Duty (OSD)
(Engineering & Construction) (E&C) and that of (d) will report to the Group General Manager (GGM)
(Hazira). OSD (E&C) and GGM (Hazira) will report to the Regional Director, Bombay Regional Business
Center (BRBC) who will have the overall responsibility for the implementation of the project in BRBC. To
ensure maximum coordination in the implementation of project components, subprojects (a) - (d), in the
Bombay High oilfield, ONGC has agreed to appognt an officer (OSD) who acts as the overall project co-
ordinator and who will be responsible for the implementation of these components. In addition, ONGC
has agreed to establish Project Implementation Units for each of the four sub-projects.
4.11        Implementation of the four subprojects will be the respotisibility of ONGC's Regional Office
in Bombay. With the implementation of the Bombav Offshore projects, phase I of the South Bassein
Developrnent project (Ln.2241-IN), and the Western Gas Development project (Ln.2904-IN), the office has
demonstrated its ability to effectively manage the implem'entation of large-scale offshore projects. Its
management team has been exposed to all phases of offshore development. As a result, it has been able to
put together a well-structured organization with staff sufficiently trained to implement this project.
4.12        To simplify procurement and reduce the risk of implementation delays, maximum use will
be made of single responsibility turnkey contracts. The items that will be procured under the project have
been grouped in 19 packages. With the exception of six packages for the expansion of the Hazira gas
terminal and three packages for platform modifications, each package will be procured on the basis of a
single responsibility turnkey contract. Under these contracts the responsibility of the contractor extends
from detailed engineering to commissioning and final acceptance by ONGC. The single responsibility
approach was chosen-as is the case with similar offshore and onshore work in India--because special-
ized contractors with thc necessary experience and resources offer the greatest chance for the expeditious
execution of contracts in spite of weather and construction risks. (The single responsibility approach
would have been impractical for the expansion of the Hazira gas terminal, tie platform modifications, the
environmental component and the implementation of measures to improve the reservoir managemnent of
the Bombay High oilfield, since implementation of these components requires close interaction with the
management of existing facilities. ONGC would be in a better position than contractors to ensure the
timely implementation of these components).
4.13        Annex 4.4 shows the major stages of project implementation. The Bank's staff u.:stimates that
ONGC will be able to complete the project in five years. The estimate of the Bank's staff takes into account
ONGC's experience with the implementation of similar projects. Delays in Government approvals, in
particular environmental clearances, difficulties in obtaining land and procurement delays have been the
main causes of slippages in project implementation in the pist. The complet.on time estimated by the
Bank's staff is considered realistic, particularly in view of the advanced stage of procurement preparation.
The Bank has reviewed the engineenng design of the bid packages and found tihem acceptable. Because of
the extreme sensitivity of the economic viability of the project to delays in project implementation, ONGC
has agreed to arrangefor ar 'iew of its procurement andproject implementa'ion organization, discuss
the results of this reviewv wit the Bank and implement its recommendations.
Status of Project Preparation
4.14        The project is in an advanced stage of preparation. Conceptual and optimization studies,
which form the groundwork for the project, and basic design and engineering have been reviewed by the
Bank and found satisfactory. Also, bid packages for procuring the major project components have been
completed and forwarded to the Bank. These documents are technically satisfactory.

Environmental and Safety Issues
4.15        Offshore oil and gas operations are hazardous to the environment and the personnel
involved. While the risks cannot be completely eliminated, they can be minimized . While the Governmenit
has not yet adopted legislation that would govern safety concerns of oftshore operations, 0NGCd eals
with these issues effectively through compliance with international safety standards. With regard to the
proposed project, the Bank's environmental and safety' specialistfound that the recovery of gas and the
transmission of gas to shore poses minimal environmental and safety risks. Construction of the platforms
and the laying of the pipelincs will not result in any lasting disturbance of marine life.
4.16        ENVIRONMENTAl. AND SAFFIY LECISLAnON. India has no legislation that deals specifically with
offshore safety. In 1985 ONGC adopted a Recommended Code of Practice for its offshore operations. This
Code is based on best practices adopted elsewhere. By following this Code, ONGC complies with relevant
international safety standards and maritime regulations. ONGC observes all of the safety standards for
offshore drilling and production platforms of the American Petroleum Institute and relevant rules of the
American Bui eau of Shipping (ABS), Britain's Lloyd's Register of Shipping and Norway's Det Norske
Veritas. Each platform is equipped with sufficient survival craft to accommodate all of the men at work at
any time, In addition, India is a signatory to the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) convention. T'he Mercantile
Marine Department is responsible for meeting the norms established by SOLAS.
4.17        Legislation regarding the protection of the environment is contained in the Environment
(Protection) Act of 1986. Under the Act, ONGC has agreed to comply with the spirit of the legislation. As
part of this agreement, ONGC is required to obtain clearances for all of its projects from the Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MOEF). Before clearing any new projects, MOEF now requires the preparation
of environmental impact assessments, environmental management plans and disaster maniagement plans.
4.18        ONGC's ARRANGEM1N-MS FOR ENVIRONMFNT AND SAiFEY. In order to be able to complv with
environmental and safety regulations, ONGC has set up a Safety and Environrnent Management Group
(SEM). The primary objective of this group is to monitor compliance with regulatory and other require-
ments. Ihe Group provides technical advice on environmental and safety issues to line managers. The
ultimate responsibility for the safety of personnel and environmental protection within each region rests
with the Board member responsible for that region.
4.19        The SEM groups receive technical support from a number of Indian organizations. The
Indian institute of Petroleum Safety and Environment Management (IPSEM; has been set up by ONGC to
provide training in the areas of offshore safety and environmental protection. The Institute of Engineering
and Ocean Technology (JEOT) has also been set up by ONGC to assist SEM Groups in the safety evalua-
tions and risk assessments of oftshore operations. The National Environmental Engineering Research
Institute (NEERI), is a public sector institute and, as such, part of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR). NEERI prepares all baseline environmental studies and environmental impact assess-
ments for ONGC's offshore projects and operations.
4.20        ONGC's SAFETY RFCORD. The Bank's staff reviewed ONGC's accident statistics an.1 roundl
that its performance in this area could be substantially improved. ONGC has agreed to carry out a safety
auditfor its entire offshore operations, discuss the results with the Bank and implement the recommenda-
tions. With regard to the proposed project, ONGC has further agreed to carry out a safety enginee-ing
study for the existing platforms that will be linked to the facilities to be constructed under the project, as
well as a supplemental environmental assessment disaster study for all new and associated existing
facilities. ONGC has agreed to retrofit existing platforms linked to the project, if necessa, y, to bring them
in line with the recommendations of the safety study. The design of the new platforms and pipelines will
include all safety engineering aspects as well as the recommendations of the supplemental disaster
assessment study.

4.21         PNoprcr RELATFI) CONSIDFRATnONS. NEERI has prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment
report (EIA) for the proposed project components in the northem and southern zones of the Bombay High
oilfield. The report has been reviewed by the Bank's staff, which agreed with its overall conclusions. These
conclusions suggest that the environmental impact of the proposed project will be within acceptable
levels, if ONGC observes the suggested safeguards. The report points out that there may be, in fact, a net
improvement in the quality of the environment as a result of the substantial reduction of gas flaring. Key
environmental and safety concems are highlighted in the following paragraphs:
(a)  UIQUID Ei'FLUiENTS. Discharges of liquids from production platforms consist of produced water,
sewage and deck drainage. Produced water is treated prior to discharge overboard. The
treatment ensures; that the oil content falls within a range of 25 to 50 parts per million.
Treatrment is monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board at a sufficient number of
sampiing points. After treatment, the effluent is discharged at a depth of 40 to 50 meters,
wihich ensures dilution to about 20 parts per billion within one kilometer of the platform.
Treatment plants are provided to handle sanitary water and sewage. These plants ensure
that the treated sewage meets the standards stipulated by the US Coast Guard. Again, these
discharges are monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board. Deck drainings are routed
to the nroduced water treatment facilities.
(b)  SOIID WASTES. The only significant source of solid wastes on a production platform are
kitchen wastes. These should be either ground and disposed of in the sea, or transported to
the shore for disposal.
(c)   NOISE AND VIBRAIION. Protection against the noise and vibration caused by equipment on the
platforms will be addressed in the Bank's review of the design of the platforms, in particular
the living quarters. The other major source of noise on an offshore platforn is the flare. By
reducing the flaring of gas, the project will also eliminate a major source of noise on offshore
platforms in the Bombay High oilfield.
(d)  DiSRUv0ON OF MARIINE LIFE.. Construction of the platforms will initially disrupt the seabed
conditions in their vicinity. The same is true for the laying of the high pressure gas
trunklines. However, these disruptions will be neither severe nor permanent. Marine growth
on offshore structures is likely to result in a localized increase in the range and quantity of
miarine life.
(e)   DISAS`TER ENVIRONME.N`AL PRO.CrTION. The potential sources of major oil spills on a production
platform are limited to large failures of the process equipnent or the oil/well fluid risers. In
the event of a substantial process leak, the platform would be quickly shut down and the
source of the leak isolated. In the event of a riser failure, the leak may continue for some
time. ONGC is equipped to deal with oil spills of up to 400 tons of spilled oil per day. To this
end, ONGC has deployed five multi-purpose support vessels in the Arabian Sea. Two of
these vessels carry containment booms and oil skimmers. Additional equipment for contain-
ing oil spills is stored ashore. The Indian Coast Guard has the capacity to deal with oil spills
of up to 300 tons per day. However, ONGC and the Coast Guard would not be able to cope
with a major oil spill. Following the recommendations of the appraisal mission, ONGC
agreed to prepare contingency plans for such an incident, wliich would involve support
from international oil spill control centers. The necessary investments would be financed
under the proposed project.
(f)  LEAKAGE FROM GAS PUIELINES. Since the gas transported in the pipelines to be constructed under
the project consists mainly of methane and does not have a significant concentration of
hydrogen sulfide, even a large release of gas into the atmosphere will not have a significant

Project Cost
4.22            The project is estimated to cost US$ 2878 million, including physical and price contingencies
as well as taxes and customs duties on imported materials and equipment of US$ 374.4 million (Table 4.1).
A breakdown of year-by-year project costs appears in Annex 4.6. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 450

Finars'ing Plan
4.24        The proposed project represents about 24% of ONGC's investment program for 1991-95.
Unlike many of its other investmnents, 69% of the total cost of the proposed project would be in foreign
exchange. ONGC will have no difficulty meeting the local cost component (31% ot . al cost) from inter-
nally generated cash. Tre principal sources of foreign exchange for this project would include the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Export-Import-Bank of Japan as well as export credit agencies and
suppliers. However, since ONGC does not earn foreign exchange, it would have to cover the remaining
foreign exchange costs through external borrowing or from the Government's free foreign exchange
reserves. ONGC has requested the Bank's assistance in nobilizing the foreign exchange required under
the proposed project.
4.25        The financing plan for the proposed project, which has been agreed with the Government
and ONGC, is summarized in Table 4.2. A detailed financing plan for the proposed project is contained in
Annex 4.7. This plan has been developed on the basis of an extei,sive analysis of the financing alternatives
currently available to ONGC. Since the bulk of foreign exchange rquirements would have to be met from
sources other than the Government or untied private loans, the procurement packages were designed to
attract the maximum amount of cofinancing from suppliers and export c edit agencies. Based on the
interest shown by the export credit agencies and suppliers, the Bank's staff estimates that about US$ 746
million or 34% of the total foreign exchange requirements could be met in this manner. To meet the
remaining foreign exchange requirements, the Govemrnent decided to seek cofinancing from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the Export-Import Bank of Japan (J-EXIM). The ADB has included financial
support for this project in its program for FY92. GOI's request for untied cofinancing is currently under
study by J-EXIM.
4.26        The Bank plays a crucial catalytic role in arranging the financing for this project, at a time
when India's credit rating has come under pressure. Taking into account the importance of this role and
the amount of cofinancing the pr lject is likely to attract, a Bank loan of US$ 450 million equivalent is
proposed. The loan, which will b madedirectly to ONGC on the Bank's standard termsfor India, will be
guaranteed by the Government. The Government will charge a guarantee fee of 1% p.a. on the outstanding
amount of the Bank loan. The foreign exchange and variable interest rate risks will be borne by ONGC.
4.27        Based on an assessment of the likely interest of cofinanciers in the various procurement

Procurement and Disbursements
4.28        Table 43, which sumnmarizes the procurement arrangements, shows that about US$ 1.2
billion worth of goods and services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for interna-
tional competitive bidding. This is equivalent to about 41% of total project cost. The Bank's loan of USS
450 million will finance about 38% of the cost of items procured under ICB. Procuremnent under limited
Intemational Competitive Bidding (LICB), financed by supplers' or export credits, is expected to amount
to about US$957 million (for a description of LICB, see Annex 4.4). Consulting services will be obtained by
ONOC in line with the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants. It is expected that the components
financed under an untied cofinancing facility currently under study by the Export-Import Bank of Japan
would be procured through ICB in line with World Bank procurement guidelines. The procurement under
the proposed Asian Development Bank loan v  Id be carried out under its guidelines.
4.29        The Bank's loan will provide financing for three major packages. Considering the small
number of packages and their large amounts, prior Bank review of all essential procurement documenta-
tion will be required. In view of the fact that timely implementation is critical for the viability of the
project, ONGC has submitted the documentation for all packages to the Bank for review. For items to be
financed by the Bank, the Bank's standard domestic preference provisions will, at ONGC's option, apply
for the evaluation and comparison of bids.
4.30        Given the urgency to complete the proposed project as scheduled, ONGC has started the
procurement process for the process platform SHG, the compressors and the linepipe for the pipeline
connecting platforn SHG with platform BPB. In addition, ONGC has incurred substantial expenditures in
the context of implementing measures to improve the reservoir management of the Bombay High oilfield.
Depending on the pace with which these measures are implemented and contracts can be finalized, up to
US$45 million of retroactive financing by the Bank may be required. ONGC has requested the Bank to
review all packages for which advance contracting might apply. The appraisal mission has made specific
recommendations to ONGC in order to bring the packages in line with the Bank's guidelines. ONGC nas
revised the packages accordingly.
4.31        The phasing of the projected disbursements of the Bank loan is shown in detail in Annex 4.8
and summarized in Table 4.4:

Source: Buik stff projectons
432         Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan is based on the assumption that the loan will
become effective by the end of the first quarter of FY92. It is expected that the loan will be completely
disbursed by December 31, 1995. While the disbursement period of five years is substantially shorter than
would be indicated by the Bank's experience with similar oil and gas projects, the advanced state of
project preparation and procurement makes this a realistic assessment. ONGC and the Govemment are
fully aware that slippages in the implementation of the project would jeopardize the viability of the
project. ONGC has worked closely with the Bank to minimize the risk of implementation delays and thus
delays in the disbursement of the Bank's loan. Based on the projected schedule of expenditures a closing
datefer the Bank's loan of December 31, 1995 has been established.

on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE). Documentation of SOEs would be retained by ONGC
and made available for review by Bank supervision missions. All other disbursemrents would be made
against full documentation. The Bank's loan will be disbursed against the categories outlined in Table 4.5.
V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
5.01         The proposed project consists of a slice of ONGC's investment program which aims at
increasing oil output from the Bombay High oilfield. As an integral part of this project, the Gas Flaring
Reduction project will finance investments that will allow ONGC to recover, compress, transport, and
process gas onshore. The gas recovery and compression facilities serve two purposes, to increase oil
output through 'gas lift' and to provide the necessary pressure for transporting gas to users onshore.
Furthermore, the pipeline and onshore gas processing facilities that will be constructed under the project
will make it possible to take gas from other offshore oil and gas fields, - South Bassein, Heera and
Neelam, and Panna and Mukta - to onshore markets.
5.02         The investments under the proposed project will eliminate the flaring of about 12 MMCMD
of associated gas and contribute to an increase of oil production by about 3 - 4 million tons a year in the
Bombay High oilfield. It is estimated that over the life of the project (1991 - 2010) an additional volume of
about 64 billion cubic meters of gas will be produced which. at current gas prices of Rs 1,500 per 1000m3
and exchange rates, represents a financial value of US$ 5 billion. This additional gas will replace liquid
petroleum products (mainly naphtha) in petrochemical and fertilizer industries, middle-distillates in
peak-load power generation, and coal and fuel oil in industrial uses and base-load power generation. As
such, the project will reduce India's petroleum import requirements and the consequent drain on foreign
exchange; it will also reduce the demand for coal in the western region, the need of additional rail trans-
port capacity for coal and the environmental pollution associated with the use of coal. The project will also
make it possible for ONGC to increase oil production in the Bombay High oilfield. Over the life of the
project these investments will add about 60 million tons of oil. Valued at US$20 per barrel, this would
represent a financial value of about US$8.2 billion.

Project Financial Analysis
5.03         Annex 5.1 contains the detailed assumptions and Annex 5.2 the calculations of the financial
rate of return of the project. This calculation is based on the capital and operating cost estimates contained
in the project cost tabic, including physical contingencies and local taxes and duties. The revenues from
sales of incremental gas are valued at Rs 1,500 per 1000 ml for the base case. All inputs have been valued
in constant 1991 terms.
5.04         Table 5.1 summarizes the financial internal rates of return for the base case and the results
of the :nsitivity analyses.

5.05         The sensitivity analyses show that the financial rate of return is quite sensitive to implernen-
tation delavs suggesting the need for efficient project implementation (para.4.13).
Project Economiic Analysis
5.06         For the economic analysis, natural gas has been valued on the basis of the fuel which it
replaces. For the purposes of project evaluation, it has been conservatively assumed that all gas replaces
fuel oil, the lowest valued replacement. Even where gas replaces coal in power generation or industrial
uses, the economic cost of coal, either imported or supplied by indigenous coal iields is roughly at par
with the cost of imported fuel oil.
5.07         Annexes 5.3 and 5.4 show the detailod assumptions and calculations of the economic rate of
return of the project. The project cost estimates are in constant 1991 dollars, net of taxes and duties. The
standard conversion factor of 0.8 has been applied to the cost of the local component of the project to br. ng
it to the level of border prices in India. Physical contingencies of 10% of the base cost estimate have also
been included. CIF costs have been used in calculating the cost of the foreign exchange component.
5.08         The operating costs are based on ONGC's experience with similar installations and repre-
sent overall about 2% of the estimated capital cost. This appears low for estimates in the offshore oil
industry but can be explained by the comparatively high proportion of pipeline investments for which
repair and maintenance costs are not as high as for platform and other investments. ONGC estimates that
1% of the capital cost is appropriate for pipeline repair and maintenance. For all other Investments the
corresponding percentage is 3%  Annex 5.1 shows the detailcd calculation of the operating cost of the
project.



-41 -
5.09         The project benefits (natural gas) have been valued at equivalent fuel oil prices expressed in
constant 1991 terms. Fuel oil prices were projected on the basis of crude oil price projections issued by the
Bank's International Commodity Markets division. The detailed calculations of the prices for the fuel oil
equivalent for gas in India are shown in Annex 5.2.
5.10         The output created by the project consists of about 64 billion cubic meters of natural gas of
which 29 billion would have to be flared without the project. Marketia. .of this incremental gas will be
carried out through the terminials in Hazira (in the State of Gujarat) and LJran (in the Bombay area). The
flow of incremental gas through Hazira requires strengthening of the HBJ gas pipe line. The cost of these
additional investments are included in the cost/benefit stream of the economic rate of return calculation.
The annual incremental production of gas will start in 1994 with a mnodest 3.6 MMCMD of gas due to the
capacity limitations of the Uran terminal. In 1996 additional gas supplies are expected to increase to 24.6
MMCMD. From then on, supplies will decline due to the gradual exhaustion of the Bombay High
oilfields. Additional finds are expected to make up for the decline in gas supplies from this major oilfield
shortfall.
5.11         When converting to natural gas there are further economic benefits in the formn of reduced
storage and handling costs, reduced maintenance costs as well as lower pollution. Additional benefits
result from the increased thermal efficiency of natural gas relative to liquid fuels. Although the mnagnitude
of these savings varies from industry to industry, their total impact can be substantial. These benefits were
not included in the benefit-cost analysis.
5.12         As menrionrt.d above, the project contributes also to an increase of oil output from the
Bonibay Hiigh oilfield, which amounts to about 60 million tons of oil over the 19 year 'life-time' of the
project. Again, the value of this contribution of the project was not taken into account in the evaluation of
the economic rate of retL rn.
5.13         Without these additional benefits, the proposed project would yield an economic rate of
return of 30%, As mentioned in paragraph 5.05 with respect to the financial rate of return, the econonmic
return is equally sensiti e to slipoages in project implementation. A delay in project implementation by
one year would reduce the rate of return to about 24%, by two years to about 20%. Any further delay
would be likely to render the project nonviable.
5.14         The sensitivity analysis made resulted in the following rates of return:

Project Risks
5.15        The project faces three najor risks:
(i)  delays in the implementation of the project which would quickly reduce its viability;
(ii) delays in the offtake of the additional gas that will be made available through the project;
and
(iii) the possibility that ONGC will not be able to raise the foreign exchange required for the
project. This risk is aggravated by the fact that India's credit worthiness has suffered re-
cently.
5.16       To minimize the risk of implementation delays, ONGC has agreed to award the construc-
tion of najor items, such as platforms and submarine pipelines, on the basis of a series of contracts under
single responsibility. In addition, ONGC has worked dosely with the Bank to streamline its organization
and management for the implementation of projects. The bidding documents for all major components of
the project have been reviewed by the Bank. (para 4.14).
5.17       The risk of delays in the offtake of the gas will be significantly reduced through the
Government's decision to set up a special monitoring committee in the Department of Petroleum and
Natural Gas that will review quarterly the progress in implementing the proposed project as well as the
projects that will utilize the additional gas supplies. The quarterly reports of the monitoring committee
will be submitted to the Bank for review together with recommendations in case of any slippage in project
implementation. The Bank will have an opportunity to review the implementation of these recommenda-
tions.
5.18       To minimize the risk that difficulties in the financing of the foreign exchange components
delay the project, the Bank has engaged in extensive consultations with ADB and J-EXIM and has worked
closely with ONGC and the Government to ascertain the availability of finance from export credit agen-
cies and suppliers. The Government's request for untied co-financing from J-EXIM is currently under
study by J-EXIM. In the unlikely event that J-EXIM is unable to participate in the financing of the project,
the Bank will assist ONGC in mobilizing credit from other export credit agencies.
5.19        While technical risks are higher for offshore than for onshore projects, ONGC has accumu-
lated considerable expertise in carrying out projects of this kind. In addition, all major project components
will be carried out by experienced contractors on a turnkey basis. Thus, the proposed project poses no
significant technical risks.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01        AGREEMENS. The following agreements have been reached:
(a)  With the Government that it will:
(i)  implement a gas pricing policy which links domestic gas prices to intemational prices
of fuel oil and discuss, with the Bank, any revisions of this pricing policy (para. 2.31-
2.32);
(ii) set up a body in the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas to monitor, on a
quarterly basis, the implementation of oil and gas field developments and revise gas
production plans accordingly; this body would monitor, also on a quarterly basis, the



-43 -
progress in construction of plants and other facilities (pipelines, gas processng
facilities. etc.) required for the projected offtake of gas. The body will issue a quarterly
report, listing any deviation from the plans of gas producers and potential consumers
and containing recommendations for steps to be taken to ensure the efficient use of
projected gas supplies. Copies of these reports would be submitted to the Bank for
review (para. 2.15);
(iii)  submit annual reports to the Bank indicating changes in gas allocations and their
imputed or net-back values (para. 2.19).
(b)  With the Oil and Natural Gas Commission that it will:
(i)   review annually with the Bank its investment program and the implications of this
program on its financial position (para. 3.22);
(ii)   naintain its current ratio at 1.2 tines or higher, its debt-service coverage ratio at 1.5
times or higher, and its debt-to-equity ratio at no more than 1: 5 (para. 3.23);
(iii)  have its annual accounts audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank
within nine months of the end of the fiscal year and provide the Bank with unaudited
financial statements (incomne statements, funds flow statement and balance sheet)
within six months of the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.11);
(iv)  retain the services of a financial advisor for mobilizing foreign exchange resources
(para. 3.26);
(v)   establish Project Implementation Units for each of the four sub-projects, and appoint
an overall coordinator (OSD) for the purposes of the Bank project (para. 4.10);
(vi)  carry out a review of its procurenent and project implementation organization,
discuss the results of this review with the Bank and implement its recommendations
(para. 4.13).
(vii)  carry out a safety audit for its entire offshore operations, discuss the results with the
Bank and implement the recommendations of the audit (para. 4.20);
(viii) carry out a safety engineering study of existing platforms linked to facilities that will
be constructed under the project, discuss the results with the Bank and implement the
recommendations of the study (para. 4.20);
6.02        The following are conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan:
(i)   announcement inviting domestic and foreign oil companies to participate in a fourth
round of bidding for offshore and onshore parcels selected by GOI for exploration
(para. 3.08);
(ii)   obtaining of the environmental clearance for all components of the proposed project
(para. 4.13); and
(iii)  establishing of a body in the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas which would
monitor the implementation of gas supply and utilization plans (para. 2.15).
6.03        RECOMMEW4DATION. On the basis of the project justification and the agreements reached during
negotiations, the proposed project would be suitable for a loan of US$450 million equivalent to the Oil and
Natural Gas Commission for a period of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The loan would be guaranteed by the Govemment of India.

Gas Production Projections
1.          GAS PRODUCrION. While associated gas production is controlle by the rate of oil production,
frec gas can be used as required up to the capacity limit of the wells, pipeline system and processing
plants. The gas caps overlying the oil cannot be drawn on until the oil has been exhausted, otherwise the
amount of oil recovered will be diminished. In order to project India's gas production, it is necessary to
make certain assumptions regarding construction and implementation of development programs to be
carried out by ONGC and GAIL. Since there are no facilities for storage of natural gas in India, apart from
the limited amount which can be accommodated by building up pressure in the pipelines (line-pack-
ing"), and given that India is a net importer of oil, it must be assumed that all oil fields will be produced at
their maximurn efficient rate and that any associated gas produced in excess of local gas demand in the
producing regions will continue to be flared. A further corollary to the lack of gas storage is that produc-
tion and consumption will be equal. The follo..ing specific assumptions were made:-
Bombay Offshore          -         The gas flaring reduction program will proceed as planned.
-        The gas oil ratio (GOR) of the Bombay High oilfield will be
reduced to 400 cubic meters of gas for eacti cubic meter of oil
produced (v /v), that is a GOR of 400:1 v/v will be maintained at
all wells.
-        Other oil fields in the area will have a GOR maintained at or
below 400:1 v/v.
-        Discovered fields in the area will sustain gas production of 52
MMCMD through year 2010.
Westem Region            -         Oil field GOR will be maintained below 500:1 v/v.
-        Free gas (which can be connected to the HBJ pipeline) will not be
put on production until 1997.
-        Discovered fields will sustain gas production of 16 MMCMD.
-        Rajasthan gas production begins in 1995 fcr local market.
Assam                    -         Discovered fields will sustain gas production of 11 MMCMD.
Tripura                  -         Gas production begins in 1993 for supply to local markets.
2.          Potential gas sales that can be sustained from existing known reserves are of the order of 93
MMCMD, even though actual producing capacity may initially exceed this level. Future discoveries of
gas are probable but, being unquantifiable, have not been taken into account. Future large discoveries
may cause substantial changes in transport and marketing requirements, depending on their physical
location. Table I summarizes the projected gas out put from oil and gas fields in the Western region and
t;-e Bombay High oilficid. These projections are conservative and only production from known fields was
taken into consideration.

Note. AU prici in this figue we expraed in terms of their thermal equivalents of 1000m3 of gas
1.            The figure above provides a comparison of the value of natural gas in major end-uses, the
manufacture of petrochemicals and fertilizer, power generation and industrial uses. The 'replacement
value' of natural gas is given by the price of the fuel which gas could potentially replace 'at the margin', --
naphtha in the petrochemical industry, coal in power generation, (subsidized) naphtha in the fertilizer
industry and fuel oil industrial uses of gas. In addition to these replacement values for natural gas, the
figure above shows ranges of net-back values of natural gas and the prices of gas at landfall points as well
as along the HBJ gas pipeline. The netback values provide an indication of the value of gas in a particular
industry. It has to be kept in mind that these net-back values are plant and therefore location-specific; at
best, they serve as an indicator of the maximum price users would be willing to pay for gas.
2.            The conclusion that can be safely drawn from the information presented in the figure above
is that gas sold at landfall prices provides an attractive alternative fuel in all major end-uses. Along the
HBJ pipeline, some users may find gas at the currently proposed prices unattractive, and may be unwill-
ing to switch to gas. However, since the prices of alternative fuels (naphtha, coal, fuel oil) will most likely
change as will transport charges for these fuels, the demand for gas along the HBJ will depend on relative
fuel prices at specific locations.

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT r
Summary of ONGC's Accounting Practices
In fiscal year 1986, ONGC changed its accounting practices to bring them into line with
international oil industry practice. The results for 1981 to 1985 have not been restated and are therefore
not fully comparable with the accounts for the later years. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India
observed that until 1989, the "Successful Efforts Method of Accounting" had not always been correctly
applied. These problems have now been corrected.
2.          Until 1985 it was ONGC's policy to write off exploration and development costs as follows:
*     ExpLORAmoN. Geological and geophysical survey costs are expensed in the fiscal year in
which they were incurred. All exploratory drilling costs were initially capitalized and
year's expenditure was amortized equally over 15 years. In case of unsuccessful efforts, the
license was surrendered and net amortized costs were expensed against income in three
equal annual installments. In case an area was declared successful, amortized costs were
transferred to producing properties.
ouPRoDucNC PRoPERnEs. The oil and gas producing properties included unamortized explor-
atory drilling costs and costs incurred on development of the producing field. These
properties were created when regular production was started from the field regardless of
the level of productionand were depreciated equally over ten years. Subsequent develop-
ment drilling costs were depreciated in a manner where total costs were charged against
income during the remaining ten year period. Development costs after the tenth year were
charged against income of the year.
3.          Following the practices of most international oil companies, ONGC changed its accounting
practices to the "Successful Efforts Method of Accounting" in 1986. Accordingly:
(a)  geological and geophysical survey costs and exploratory drilling costs (net of amortization)
in areas declared unsuccessful and surrendered have been expensed in the year of account;
(b)  exploratory drilling costs (net of amortization) in respect of areas yet to be determined as
successful or abortive, have now been capitalized as "Wells-in-Progress" and
(c)  all accumulated exploratory drilling costs and development costs for successful fields,
including related facilities, have been capitalized. These costs have been taken net of amorti-
zation, depletion and depreciation already charged until previous years (without disturbing
the past adjustments) and have been expensed following the "Unit of Production Method"
by individual field or basin. The unit rate has been worked out taking the net cost as of
April 1, 1985 and year's addition with reference to recoverable reserves as of january 1, 1986.
The recoverable reserves have been limited to A, B, and C-1 categories of reserves.
-     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENr coCs other than on Capital Assets are charged against
income as incurred.
-     DEPRECATION. Plant and equipment and other capital items are stated at cost and then
depreciated on diminishing balance method at the rates set forth in the Income Tax

Summary of ONGC's Accounting Practices
Act, 1961, except the Research and Development Equipment which is depreciated on
straight line method on five equal annual installments.
INvEwroRiEs. The stocks of crude oil from C1'F point onwards in saleable condition,
and that of LPG and NGL in storage tanks, are stated at direct cost. Gas stocks in
pipeline are not taken note of as it is not possible to measure such stocks. Inventories
of stores and spares and assets for replacement are stated at cost.
FoREICN CURRECY TRANSACnONS. All expenditure incurred and liabilities undertaken
in the form of loans drawn and/or other liabilities are provided at the exchange rate
prevailing on the date of the transaction. These liabilities are recogni7ed, on the last
day of the accounting year, at the mean of the buying and selling rate of exchange
prevailing on that date. The difference arising out of such adjustments and also
changes in the value of cash balance and other adjustable advances held abroad are
adjusted to the relevant head of account wherever feasible, otherwise to the Profit and
Loss Account.
LONG TERM DERTS. The practice of considering the portion of the Long Term Debts
maturing for payment in the ensuing year as a current liability was discontinued after
March 31, 1988.
CoRPoRATE TAXFS. Taxes are levied on income determined after providing for amorti-
zation and depletion in accordance with the provision in the Agreement with the
Government under Section 42 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. For Corporate Tax
purposes, total depreciation charged, whether allocable to production and transporta-
tion activities or to exploration and development activity, is considered as an item of
expendituire against year's income.
Note: All years refer to Indian fiscal years starting on April I

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT                             Fage I of 2
Assumptions to the Financial Projections
General
1.           Figures may appear not to add up due to rounding. All years relate to Indian fiscal years
ending March3 1. The financial projections do not take into account the transfer of assets from ONGC to
GAIL, which is anticipated to take place during 1991. The overall etect on ONGCs financial position is,
however, expected to be neutral.
2.           The exchange rates and price escalation rates used in the financial projections are as follows:
Exchange Ra,es and Inflation Rates    1991 1992 1993 1994 1995
Exchange rates (I USS equivalent) Rs  19.4 20,8 21.8 23.0 24.1
Domestic inflation (percent)  8.3  6.6  6.5  6.5  6.2
International inflation (percent)  3.4  3.4  3.4  3.4  3.4
Source: Bank staff projections
For the year end revaluation of long term debt in currencies other than the US Dollar, exchange rates
prevailing on December 31, 1990 are assumed to depreciate against the Rupee at the same rates as the US
Dollar.
Income statements
3.           Projected sales of crude oil and gas are based on ONGCs production forecasts, taking into
account ongoing and planned development schemes. For the purpose of the financial projections pro-
jected revenues assume the same producer prices for crude oil and gas as those prevailing in FY91 (Annex
3.9) throughout the projected period. The level of royalties, excise cess and sales tax has also been as-
sumed constant.
4.           Cash operating expenses are based on ONGC's budget estimates and take into account
requirements for increased production and intlation.
5.           Deprdciation, depletion and amortization assume the continued application of ONGC's
current accounting policies (Annex 3.2) at rates permissible under the income tax act.
6.           Average interest receipts were assumed at an average of 10.5% of ONGC's long term
investments and ISU loans. Interest paid represent ONGC's projected annual interest payments on its
long term debt
7.           Corporate tax liability was assumed as 20% of operating income. In line with past practices
dividend payments were assumed as 1% of total equity.

Fund Flow Statements
8.          New borrowings take into account the proposed project financing plan. Foreign currency
loans onlent by Govemment assume a 15% interest rate with a 5 year grace period and 15 year overall
maturity. New export credits were assumed at a 10% interest rate with annual repayments of 10% of the
amnount outstanding at the end of each year.
9.          Details of ONGC's planned capital expenditure are given in Annex 3.8. The amounts have
been adjusted for inflation and fixed asset additions are based on ONGC's current accounting practices. It
should be noted that the proposed investment program was based on ONGC and Bank estimates and not
all expenditures have been approved by the Government.
Balance sheets
10.         Current assets: Average level of cash and bank balances was assumed at 30% of cash
operating costs. Debtors assume a credit period of 21 days for crude oil, 15 days for LPG and NGL sales
and 30 days for natural gas. The level of inventories was assumed at 12% of net fixed assets. Other assets
were assumed to increase with domestic inflation.
11.         Current liabilities were assumed to increase with inflation.
12.        Increases and decreases in long term investments were determined by the level of total
sources available after taking into account working capital requirements, debt service and capital expendi-
ture.

Layout Optimization of the Pipelines to be Constructed
1.         While the design of the process platforns and related gathering fluid lines for the Bombay
High field is fairly standardized, the layout cn-eptualization of the gas trunk pipelines requires some
attention to the optimum route in relation to potential gas markets. The principal factors that were taken
into account in the decision of the layout of the proposed gas pipeline system included review of the
recoverable reserves, market growth rate, consumption pattern and problems associated with the develop-
ment of the infrastructure. The review of the Bombay High, South Bassein and surrounding fields poten-
til indicates that the project would sustain the delivery of 30 to 35 MMCMD of gas for the next 20 years
In addition, new offshore gas reserves are being identified north of the Bombay offshore field towards the
Gulf of Cambay. The conceptualization of the proposed pipeline system as well as the flow capacity of the
processing facilities have, therefore, taken into account the issue of whether the gas should be taken to the
Bombay area or to the northern part of the country along the HBJ gas pipeline. After a careful review of
the gas demand projections, market constraints and pattern of consumption, it is proposed that the project
would bring gas to both the Bombay area and Hazira as wel as areas along the HBJ pipeline.
2.         The Bombay area market, where gas is mainly used as industrial fuel, is a supply con-
strained market with long lead times for development of the necessary additional gas supply infrastruc-
ture. This market will continue to be dependent on the Uran terminal for the next 8 to 10 years. The
supply shortfall is, however, expected to be substantially reduced with the expansion of the terminal
which will be undertaken soon under a separate project. The terminal, which is now supplying 12
MMCMD, will be expanded to its maximum capacity of 16 MMCMD. As the demand is projected to grow
further, ONGC is proposing to the Government the construction of a new terminal to increase the supply
by 10 MMCMD of gas. With regard to the market along the HBJ gas pipeline with a current consumption
of about 15 MMCMD as feedstock for fertilizers, the demand has been less than anticipated. There is,
however, a perceptible shift occurring in the previous policies of gas allocation and pricing that have up to
now hindered greater gas utilization along this pipeline. The demand for gas along the HBj is now
proiected to grow at a fairly rapid and higher rate than for the Bombay area. Power generation is expected
to entail a big increase in gas use. Other markets, including petrochemicals, are also being developed.
Various projections indicate that overall gas demand along the HBJ pipeline would increase to 40
MMCMD by 1995-96.
3.         The quantity of additional gas to be supplied to the Bombay area market would be limited
to the maximum capacity (16 MMCMD) of the Uran gas terminal. To meet this additional quantity, the
existing Uran - Heera gas pipeline would require to be extended to the Bombay High field. It is only
through this extension, the ICP-Heera gas pipeline, that the supply of the Bombay market can be increased
and the current gas flaring substantially reduced. Since no gas compression would be required, the
construction of this line would have to be undertaken as soon as possible in order to be completed simul-
taneously with the expansion of the Uran terminal. Such a line, for which the precise route would be
determined by the detailed engineering design, could also be used for the transport of the Bombay High
gs cap at a later date as well as associated gas from any of the recent discoveries made in the Bombay
High field area. Furtmore, the line would optimize ONGC's contingency response capability should
the existing old line need to be repaired. With regard to the mnarket along the HBJ gas pipeline, it becomes
necesary that a new pipeline be built between Bombay High and Hazira. The pipeline construction
would consist of two wgments, from Bombay High to South Bassein (SHG-BPB) and then to Hazira.
Subeequently, the capacity of the Hazira gas terminal would need to be expanded.

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT                      Pe 2 of 4
Lay-out Optimization of the Pipelines to be Constructed
4.         The project optimization design carried out by ONGCs consultant EIL has been reviewed
by the Bank and found acceptable. It is a preliminary engineering design based on an exhaustive study of
all pertinent factors and data related to gas recoverable reserves and utilization plans. The sizing and
broad specifications of the project facilities including the pipeline system layout have been determined
following a careful evaluation of available alternatives. The detailed engineering design would be carried
out by the contractor to be selected for the construction of the project component. The current preliminary
design is sufficiently flexible to allow configuration design adjustments to be recommended by the
detailed engineering design. Figure 1 shows the schemnatic layout of the existing gas pipelines and those
that will be constructed under the project. Figure 2 shows the expected flows of gas through the pipeline
system in the Western offshore region.

GAS .LARING REDUCTION PROJECT                        Pag I of
Detailed Project Description
Background
1.          ONGC has decided to implement a najor investment program aimed at enhancing oil
production in the Bombay High oilfield. This oilfield, which is about 160 km west-northwest of Bombay
and in the Arabian Sea, accounts for about two thirds of the country's current oil production of about 32
million tons a year. The field was discovered in 1974 and put on production in 1976. The program
consists of further development of proven oil and gas reserves of the field's only producing reservoirs, L-
III and L-II. It is part of a long-tern development scheme, which has been carried out in time phased
sequences to allow a better delineation and understanding of the field's priarry producing mechanism.
2.          L-III REsRvoiR. This reservoir accounts for about 90% of the field's total oil-in-place reserves
of about 1500 million tons. It extends within the entire field area at an average depth of 1300 m. An East-
West sedimnentary discontinuity divides the field into two sectors, the North and the South. About one
third of the L-1I1 oil reserves is located in the North and two thirds in the South. Oil production from L-III
North started in 1976 and reached a plateau rate of 6.25 million tons per year in 1980. It started to decline
in 1987. In 1990 it produced about five million tons per year. The decline in production was largely due
to the shutting of several welkl as a result of delays in implementing the pressure maintenance and gas-lift
programs. By the end of 1990, the cumulative production from L-l1 North had reached about 68 million
tons of oil and 21 billion cubic meters of gas, representing about 18% of the initial in-place reserves. Oil
production from L-lI1 South started in 1980 and reached a level of about 13 million tons per year in 1983
and maintained between 13 and 15 mnillion tons per year thereafter. By the end of 1990, the cumulative
production from L-III South had reached about 113.5 million tons of oil and 28 billion cubic ineters of gas,
representing about 12% of the initial in-place reserves.
3.          L-il REsERvoIR. The L-II reservoi:, which accounts for slightly less than 10% of the field's
total oil reserves, is located only in the northern part of the field at an average depth of 950 m. It has a
limited oa column thickness of 25 to 30 m. It remained undeveloped because ONGC devoted its efforts to
first develop the L-III reservoir. Its performance, however, has been conclusively tested by some 20
production wells. Some of these wells have been producing oil since 1981. Its production rate has reached
one million tons per year of which two thirds comes from four horizontal wells drilled over the past four
years. The L-Il reservoir will now be developed and is expected to sustain a production level of about 1.5
million tons per year of oil and two million cubic meters of gas for the next 10 years.
Program for Enhancing Oil Production From the Bombay High Oilfield
4.          A feasibility study, carried out in 1987 and 1988 by ONGC with the assistance of the French
oil company CFP Total, indicatea that the Bombay High production can be substantially increased and its
overall decline delayed by developing the westem and southem peripheral areas of the L-1lI reservoir in
the South and the L-II reservoir in the North. The L-III reservoir development, the largest program,
would consist of construction of eight well platforms with the drilling of 78 infill wells, a process platform,
a water injection platform, an interconnecting gas pipeline system and two trunk gas pipelines, one to the
Hazira Gas Terminal (located about 260 km north of Bombay in the southem part of the Gujarat State) and
the other to the Heera field (located about 70 km southwest of Bombay in the Arabian Sea) where it would
be connected to the existing Heera-Uran gas pipeline which is currently supplying about 1.5 MMCMD of

gas from Heera to the Uran Oil and Gas Terminal (about 15 Jr. southeast of Bomnbay) for the Bombay area
narket. rae L-III program is expected to increase the production by about 40 million tons of oil and 18
Bcm of gas during the 1B95-2010 period. The L-11 reservoir development will cons.;t of construction of
five well platforns with the drilling of 42 infill wells, a process platform and an inter-connecting gas
pipeline system. The L-II vrogram is expected to increase the production by at least 16.5 million tons of oil
and 6 Bcm of gas during the 1995-2010 period.
5.           To accommodate the additional production, ONGC is expanding the gas processing capac-
ity of the Uran terminal frn.n 12 to 16 MMCMD, ar.d that of the Hazira gas terminal from 20 to 41
MMCMD. The expansion feasibility and environnental impact studies for the Hazira terminal are
expected to be submitted for Government approval within the first quarter of 1991. Furthermore, cor.-
struction of an additional oil and gas terminal with a first phase processIng capacity of 10 million tons of
oil pei, year and 10 MMCNMD of gas is being studied by ONGC's consultant, Engineers India Ltd. Accord-

ing to ONGCs current plans, this terminal will be built at Usar, some 40 km south of Uran. It would
increase the gas supply of the Bombay area from 16 to 26 MMCMD. lmplementatio*. of the entire pro-
gram, including construction of the terrninals, is planned to take seven to eight years. DL velopment of the
Bombay High L-III and L-ll reservoirs along with construction of related gas pipeline systems and expan-
sion of the Uran and Hazira terminals is expected to be completed during the first five years of the devel-
opment program.
Project Proposed Project
6.          The project proposed for Bank financing would provide support for those components of
the Bombay High development program that are required to eliminate the flaring of associated gas. The
project would enable ONGC to recover an additional 7 to 8 MMCMD of gas over and above the 12 to 14
MMCMD of gas that are currently being flared. The project consists of
* Construction of a process platform, SHG, in the southern sector of the Bombay High oil field
with a processing capacity of 100,000 barrels (bbl) of oil per day, 15 MMCMD of gas and
140,000 bbl of water per day. The platform includes a 78 kilometer (km) pipeline with a
diameter of 28 inches to the BPB platform at South - Bassein.
-   Construction of a process platform, NQP, in the northern sector of the Bombay High oil
field, with a processing capacity of 60,000 bbl of oil per day, 6.8 MMCMD of gas and 30,000
bbl of water per day. The platform includes a 30 km pipeline with a diameter of 18 inches to
the BHN - Uran gas trunk pipeline.
*    Modifications of existing platformns.
*    Construction of a 142 km gas pipeline, (26 - 36 inches) from the existing process platform,
ICP, in the southern sector of the Bombay High oil field to the Heera - Uran trunk pipeline.

well fluid lines along with a gas pipeline to connect the platform to the Bombay High-Uran trunk gas
pipeline.
8.          CONSTRUCMON OF SHG PROCESS PLATFORM. This is to be a two-deck, eight leg platform with a
processing capacity of 100,000 barrels of oil per day, 15 MMCM'. of gas and 140,000 barrels of water per
day. It will be installed in the southem part of the field in about 70 m water depth and connected by a
bridge to the existing SHP and SHQ processing platforms It will have facilities for oil, gas and water
separation, water treatment, gas dehydration and compression high pressure ilare to be located at about
one kilometer away on a tripod, fire protection, oil pumping, telecommunications, telemetry and
telecontrol. The platform construction will include supply and construction of the interconnecting well
fluid lines, installation of seven gas compressor modules and construction of a gas pipeline to connect the
platform to the BPB platform in the South Bassein gas field. The gas compressor modules and the line
pipes will be procured separately from the platform.
9.          CONSrRucION OF GAS COMPRRSSOR MODUxES. Seven gas turbine driven centrifugal compressor
modules will be built by specialized manufacturers and supplied to the SHG platform contractor for
installation. Each module will be designed for 2.5 MMCMD compression capacity at 8 to 10.5 kg/cm2
suction and 134 kg/cm2 discharge pressures. The primary objective of these compressors will be to
provide sufficient pressure to transport the gas through a 330 km submarine pipeline to the Hazira
Terminal. A small quantity of the cornpressed gas will be distributed and circulated in the oil producing
wells to improve their productivity through gas lift mnechanism.
10.         MOI)IrICArION OF E)asnNG PLATrFORMs. In order to fully integrate the platforms NQP and SHG
into the existing process scheme, some of the existing process platforms will need to be upgraded. Separa-
tion facilities will be overhauled and their capacity increased as more gas and water are being produced
together with the oil from the ageing reservoirs. Acoditional lines with pipeline scraper launchers and
receivers w ill be built between the new and existing well platforms. Piping configuration will also be
reviewed and s:me lines changerl. Structural reinforcement will be required for some of the oldest
platforms. Existing living quarters will be expanded to accommodate the personnel of the new platforms.
The modifications will be c3rried out under the NQP and SHG platform construction contracts on four
well platforms (NO, NW, NHi, and N6) and four process platforms (NQD, NQO, NQG, and NQF) in
Bombay High North, eight wclU platforms (SY, SW, SY, IL., 1K, SS, II and IH) and four process platforms
(SHP, SHID, SCA, and SHQ) in 13ombav High South and one process platform (BPB) in South Bassein. The
work to be carried ouit under this component will consist of three subcomponents:
(a)  Procurenment, coating and laying of 77.9 kilometers of well fluid lines in the north and south
sectors of the Bombay High oilfield;
(b)  Modification of the following existing weil platforms so that they can handle additional well
fluids: NA, NB, NM, N2, NL, IB, ID, SM, EB, SI, SC and SA; and
(c}   Modification of the following existing well platforms: BHN, NC, BHS. SCA and iCP. Modifi-
cations would involve the production separators, produced water conditioners and flare
systems.

lines. About four well fluid lines will be built in the North (from NQP, NQO and NQG complex to NH 8.5
km, NO 3.6 km, NW 7 km and N6 11 km) and three in the South (from SHG, SHP and SHQ complex to SY
8 km, IL 8 km and IH 15.5 km). The two gas lirnes will consist of (i) a 30 km long, 18 inch diameter pipeline
with a flow capacity of six MMCMD (from the platform NQP to the Bombay High-Uran trunk pipeline)
and (ii) a 78 km long, 28 inch diameter pipeline with a flow capacity of 15 MMCMD (from the platform
SHG to the South Bassein gas field). The construction of these lines aJong with the well fluid lines will be
carried out under the NQP and SHG platform construction contracts.
12.         ICP-HEFRA PIPL:LINE. To take all associated gas to shore, two new trunk gas pipelines will be
built under the project. The ICP-Heera Trunk pipeline, also called the South Loop, will stretch 142 km
from the ICP platform in the Bombay High field to the HRG platform in the Heera field, where it will be

Detailed Project Desaiption
connected to the 26 inch size, 85 km long Heera-Uraa gas trunik pipeline. Its size has not yet been deter-
mined, but will be between 26 and 30 inches for a gas flow capacitv of about 9.5 MMCMD. It will be
connected to the SHG process complex by a 22 inch size, 11 km long line. It will supply gas to the Uran
terminal for the Bombay area market. Its construction will complete the South Loop for which the first
section, Heera-Uran, was completed in July 1990 under a separate Bank financed project (Western Gas
Development Project, Loan 2904-IN). The new line will carry about 3.5 MMCMD from Bombay High
South to Uran as soon as its extension is complete. Its design will also optimize contingency response
capabilities of ONGC should the 15 year old Bombay High-Uran trunk gas pipeline become idle for
service and repair. The risks of disruption of the existing pipeline system have been assessed under a
project previously called the Western Offshore Integrated Development Prosect (WOIDP). The WOIDP, as
originally designed. has been abandoned. However, several of its key components have been integrated
into the new developmnent program.
13.        BPB - HAaiA PIWPLINE. The second trunk gas pipeline, BPB-Hazira, will stretch some 255 km
from South Bassein gas field (about 65 km west of Bombay in the Arabian Sea) to a landfall point near
Umrat (about 235 km northeast of South Bassein and 240 km north of Bombay in the southern part of the
State of Gujarat) and then to the Hazira gas terminal (about 20 km north of Umrat). It will be built along
the existing South Bassein - Hazira gas pipeline. Its size has not yet been determined but will be between
36 and 42 inches for a gas flow capacity of about 20 to 25 MMCMD. It will connect with the SHG-BPB gas
line and transport about I MMCMD of associated gas from the Bombay High oilfield and 5 MMCMD of
sour gas from the South Bassein field and nearby fields such as Panna to the Hazira gas terminal.
14.        The size selection for both pipelines, ICP-Heera and South Bassein-Hazira, will determine
whether the gas to be transported should be "wet" or "dry." A wet gas contains some hydromarbon
liquids (condensate), which will undergo some degree of condensation during transport depending on the
composition of the gas, transient temperature and pressure conditionrs in the pipeline. For the same
volume, a wet gas requires a slightly larger pipeline size than a dry gas from which most of the conden-
sate have been removed. In the present case, condensate removal will require complex treatment with
additional offshore platform space and facilities such as refrigeration units, condensate handling and
other equipment, which could, as in the case of existing gas pipelines, offset the incremental cost of larger
pipeline sizes. ONGC will consider the least cost option on the basis of an ongoing engineering study. All
interconnecting and trunk submarine pipeline routes will be in well known areas. Most of the pipelaying
corridors have been surveyed under pievious construction activities and do not present any implementa-
tion difficulties.
15.        EXPANSION OF HAnRA GAS TERMINAL. In order to be utilized efficiently and sdfely, natural gas
delivered to consumers must meet certain requirements and specifications. Untreated or unprocessed
natural gas contains many hydrocarbon compounds and a few non-hydrocarbon compounds. Some of
them are of considerable value (LPGs and NGLs), while others are contaminants that render the gas
un1suitable for most commercial uses (water, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide). In the case of Bombay
High gas, the water content is controlled through dehydration carried out on the field's process platforms.
The removal of certain hydrocarbon components to meet hydrocarbon dewpoint specifications is carried
out at the Hazira terminal. The Hazira terminal is also designed to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen
sulfide, which are found in high concentration in South Bassein and Panna gas fields. The hydrogen
sulfide is a poisonous gas that could be a serious hazard to the environment if it is not treated properly.

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT                        TNaeR of 6
Detailed Project Desaiption
16.         The Hazira Gas Terminal has been built in phases. The first one for a capacity of 10
MMCMD of gas from South Bassein field was financed by the Bank under a loan that closed on December
31,1988 (South Bassein Gas Development Project - Loan 2241-IN). It was completed and commissioned in
July 1988. The second phase, to increase the terminal's capacity by another 10 MMCMD of gas also from
South Bassein, is almost complete. This second phase is also financed by an ongoing Bank project (West-
em Gas Development Project, Loan 2904-IN). Presently, the terminal is processing about 15 MMCMD
(five from Bombay High and the remaining from South Bassein). Sour gas from South Bassein is pro-
cessed to remove hydrogen sulfide, which is converted into sulfur. The sweet gas is dehydrated and then
its heavier hydrocarbon components removed. Gas liquids are fractionated to extract LPGs and NGLs.
The lean gas is piped to consumers along the Hazira-Bijaipur-Jaghdishpur (HBJ) pipeline.
17.         The proposed third phase expansion of the Hazira Gas Terninal will increase its processing
capacity from 20 to 41 MMCMD. The new facilities to be designed for a 21 MMCMD capacity will be
similar to the existing ones. They will consist of two slug catcher units (one for sweet gas and the other
one for sour gas), one gas sweetening train, one sulfur recovery train, one gas dehydration unit, four dew
point depression trains and four condensate fractionation trains. The size of the sweetening, sulfur
recovery and dehydration units will have a processing capacity of five MMCMD of sour gas, which will
come from the South Bassein and Panna fields. The liquid hydrocarbon recovery from the proposed
expansion will be 192,000 tons per year of LPG and 360,000 tons per year of NGLs. Additional plant
utilities and offsite facilities, such as power generation, cooling water, product storage and product
loading terninal will also be required.
18.         E.VI\ONoMhN-rAl. COMPONFNTr. Following the appraisal mission's review of environmental and
safety issues emerging from ONGC's offshore operations, ONGC requested financing for
(a)  a safety assessment of its offshore operations and the proposed oil and gas terminal at Usar;
(b)  staff training in safety and environmental engineering;
(c)  strengthening of the current arrangements for rescue of persons at sea;
(d)  an expansion of ONGC's current capacity to combat oil spills;
(e)  enhancing ONGC's capdbility to monitor the impact of its operations on environmentally
sensitive areas, in particular the marine ecosystem;
(f)  the implementation of an environmental monitoring program of all of ONGC's operations;
and
(g)  strengthening ONGC's capability to deal with the risk of fires through the desigrn of efticient
flare systems and risk assessment studies.
19.         RESERVOIR MANAGEMSENT COMPONENT. The rapid increase of gas flaring is, to a large extent, due
to the delay in water injection and other measures that proper reservoir management practices would
require. ONGC requested financial support for a study of the Bombay High reservoir, which should
recommnend a number of steps to optimize hydrocarbon production and arrest the decline of oil output
from this field. This component will provide financial support for equipment, materials and services
needed for the workover and rehabilitation of designated oilwells.

Limited International Competitive Bidding (LICB)
1.            LICB is a procedure which will be followed by ONGC in procuring of certain project
componienits, e.g. linepipe, the process platform SHG and other items, which the Bank will not finance and
for which export and suppliers credits would be required. This procedure is neither new nor uncommon;
it is more often used in relatively more developed countries. Bids under this procedure are often referred
to as "price & terms" bids. However, LICB has not yet been used i;] conjunction with Bank-supported
projects in Inidia. Essentially, LICB is a resource mobilization technique used in cases where there are
indications of strong supplier interest and where the prospective borrower finds it convenient to leave the
resource mobilization responsibility with the suppliers. It is a practical way to mobilize resources in
situations where the actual source of supply would become known only after the bid(ding and where, at
the same titne, the borrower has reasonable evidence that the major part of prospective suppliers would
be in a position to provide the requisite financing from, or with the guarantee of, the official sources, such
as Export Credit Agencies (ECAs). The Bank will not firance any portion of the LICBs.
2.            T here are two main features of LICB which distinguish it from international competitive
bidding, as generally defined by the procurement guidelines of multilateral development institutions:
(i)    Under LICB, the bidders are required (as opposed to being given an option), in
addition to quoting the price, to offer financing at certain mninimum terms and
conditions, specified beforehand; and
(ii)    The responsive bids under LICB are evaluated on the basis of the quoted price and
the offered terrns of financing. Customarily, this process entails the evaluation of bids
on the basis of their present value, calculated by applying a pre-announced discount
factor(s).
3.            The main advantage of LICB for the borrower is (external) resource mobilization under
competitive conditions, whereby the risk of price distortions in minimized. A possible disadvantage of
LICB is the risk of elimination of otherwise competitive bidders who cannot furnish the requisite financ-
ing. It is therefore necessary to use LICB judiciously. In the case of the proposed project, two aspects of

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT                         age 3 of3
Project Implementation Schedule
LICB underwent particular scrutiny by ONGC as well as by the World Bank: (i) supplier interest in the
procurement of project items -eferred to in para. : above; and (ii) availability of credit to ONGC from the
prospective supplier countries. Extensive screening of the prospective suppliers as well as of those ECAs,
which are considered to be the most likely source of credit under the subject LICB confirmed the existence
of keen interest in the project among suppliers, and the availability of sufficient amounts of export credit,
or export credit insurance cover.
4.          As regards suppliers' interest in bidding for the delivery of project items envisaged for
procurement under LICB, evidence was obtained through the tenders issued by ONGC in 1990 for the
supply of line pipe and equipment for the SHG Complex and for the ICP-Heera Pipeline, on which
occasion about half a dozen suppliers from Western Europe, North America and Japan submitted their
bids. Most of those bidders also indicated that they would be in a position to furnish credit. Subsequently,
the World Bank also contacted a number of ECAs from the countries where the items envisaged for LICB
were likely to originate. In all cases, indications were received of ONGC's eligibility for export credit. On
that basis, the procurement under LICB in an estimated amount of about U&M957 million was deemed
feasible.
5.          One of the key issues that a prospective LICB user has to resolve relates to the minimum
terms and conditions of financing which the (responsive) bidders would be required tc furnish. Under the
circumstances, given the length of the period required to depreciate the LICB-procured items and the type
of financing that appeared available for the purpose, ONGC decided to define the minimurmi acceptable
tenns of financing under LICB as the most favorable terms and conditions available to India under the
OECD Export Credit Arrangement (the so-called "OECD Consensus"). For projects of a long-term nature,
the Consensus terms would imply a minimum repayment period of 8.5-10 years, commencing a certain
period, e.g. 6 months, after installation of equipment, thus effectively resulting in Ic ans with final maturity
in excess of 10 years. T he applicable interest rate, which would be determined on tU E basis of a matrix of
export credit rates which is revised by the Consensus members every 6 months. Fok example, on January
15, 1991, the matrix rate for Consensus export credits to India, with mraturity over 8.5 years and up to 10
years, was 9.2 per cent per annum. As an alternative to this rate, ONGC could choose Commercial Intei t
Reference Rates given that the Consensus allows the borrower to seek commercial rates for various
currencies in cases when those are lower than the Consensus matrix rate. Customarily, the financing
under the Consensus would cover 85 % of the value of goods furnished.
6.          In order to ensure the mobilization of resources under LICB, ONGC will require all the
participating bidders to furnish evidence of the availability of the stipulated credit at the time of bid
submission (or, alternatively, at prequalification, in the event that it should be used as a part of the bid-
ding process). Such evidence should be in the form of expressions of interest from ECAs or other financial
institutions, indicating that the stipulated credit would be available at requisite terms and condiitions or
better, in the event that the given bidder is actually awarded the contract.
7.          As indicated above, such bids would be evaluated on the basis of their present value, which
would be arrived at by applying a predetermnined discount factor(s).

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT                        Page 1 of 3
Environmental Aspects
1.          The project is expected to have a major positive environmental impact. The recovery of a
substantial quantity of natural gas that is currently being flared will substantially improve the environ-
ment. In addition, the recovery of flared gas along with the incremental gas to be produced under the
project would displace a substantial quantity of fuel oil being used in various small and medium indus-
tries in the Bombay areas where industrial and population concentration is already confronting pollution
problems. Similarly, the power generation program to be supplied with natural gas along the HBJ pipe-
line under the project would also displace coal. This would improve air quality by reducing air pollutants
caused by the use of coal such as ash, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon diox-
ide.
2.          While the use of natural gas compared to that of other fossil fuels is highly beneficial to the
environment, its development and production entail some environmental and safety hazards. To cope
with these hazards, the industry has developed a series of guidelines, which are compiled and updated by
international agencies (Anetrican Petroleum Institute, American Bureau of Shippin& Uoyds Shipping
Register, and Det Norike Veritas). In most countries, thesc guidelines are adjusted to the country's specific
situation and enforced through national legislation or other regulations. In this regard, ONGC has
adopted a Recomrnended Code of Practice and applies the Indian Environment Protection Act of 1986 for
its oil and gas operations. All projects are subject to a Govemnment environmental clearance (Ministry of
Environment and Forests) which requires a satisfactory environmental impact assessment with environ-
mental management plans and disaster management plans.
3.          ONGC's safety and environmental guidelines and regulat.ons as well as ONGC observance
were evaluated by Bank consultant and staff and found satisfactory. The Bank consultant has also carried
out a comprehensive review of the safety and environmental issues associated with the proposed project.
It was found that the occupational safety of field personnel has substantially improved over the past 12
months; while no major environmental issues have emerged fhom the review, there is, however, a poten-
tially adverse impact inherent in the project's implementation activities particularly with regard to devel-
opment drilling, construction of the process platforms, construction of the gas pipelines and expansion of
Hazira terminal.
4.          FATAL AcaDENr RAm1  The number of fatal accidents related to the Bombay offshore activi-
ties has oeen relatively high over the past five years (1985:1; 1986:2; 1987:1; 1988:3 of which 1 onshore and
1 for ONGC's contractors; 1989: 5 of which 3 for ONGC's contractors; and 1990:0). Of the 12 fatal accidents
three were man over-board accidents and three were related to drilling activities including a well blow-
out during drilling. In view of the steep increase of fatalities in 1988-89, ONGC adopted several measures
to enhance the level of safety awareness and emergency preparedness. One of the measures is a risk
analysis and safety audit of production platforms. Engineers India Ltd. with the back up of an external
consulting firm have been carrying out this work since July 1989. These measures were discussed with
Bank staff, which found them satisfactory. The fact that there were no fatalities in 1990 seems to point to
the effectiveness of the steps taken by ONGC.
5.          DEv ELrr DRILLING. While development drilling is not a project component, several wells
will be drilled within the project area to increase oil and gas production. The potential risk to the environ-
ment of offshore drilling is largely due to the increase of drilling waste and the effects of well blow outs.
Drilling waste consists mainly of drilling fluids (drilling and chemicals), residual substances and drill

cuttings (various rocks recovered while drilling the wells). ONGC does not use oil based drilli;g ritid.ls
which are a major source of 2ollution. It uses water based drilling fluids which are continuously condi-
tioned (using solid control equipment and adequate treatment) and recovered at the end of each cycle.
Drill cuttings are washed and discharged into surface waters. Well blow outs with oil and gas 'iischarge
while drilling represent another major danger to the environment. To minimize this dagr.er, L)NC,( use's
drilling rigs with field proven mechanical integrity and blow out preventers with rermote control systems
Drilling equipment is operated by experienced crews often provided by international contractors.
6.          In the unlikely event of a blow-out with oil discharge, the oil spill would not exceed 4(X)
tons of oil per day. This estimate is based on the production average of the wells in the area. For this
purpose, ONGC has five multi-purpose vessels of which two are equipped with booms and oil skimmers
with an oil spill recovery capacity equivalent to a well blow-out discharge. Additional facilities are
available with the Indian Coastguard for a recovery capacity of about 300 tons per day. It should be noted
that for larger oil spills, ONGC can avail the services of established worldwide oil spill control centers
7.           CONSTRUCnON OF nfE PROCESS :I`.ATFORMS. Construction and installation of process platfornl;
entail no environmental risks, except very limited disturbances of the sea floor during location sampliln.
and platform siting. As the main functions of the platform are oil, gas and water separation, gas cornlpft1 
sion and water treatment the Lnvironmental risks may occur after the platforms are put into productiot,
from effluents generated from produced water or leaks of oil and gas. For this purpose the platfonrms will
be equipped with adequate water treatment facilities particularly for removal -f any oil or grease. Moni-
tors to activate warning signals wotuld be installed wherever there is a risk of leaks. Accidental oil and gois
spills will be minimized through appropriate operating and maintenance practices that were fotiund to tho
adequate.
8.           RE4EDIAL MEASURES FR EXSTINNG PlAIFORMS. A review of the environmental and safety
related equipment and practices on the existing platforms of the Bombay High fields will be carried out ,is
part of the proposed project. In addition to the safety audit being carried out, the modifications planinied
tor the existing platforms will take into account the latest environmental and safety regulations In this
regard, the high pressure gas riser of NQO platf'orm, located beneath the iiving quarters would be relo
cated on platforms with no living quarters such as NQP or NQG. This approach will be followed in the
future in simnilar situations.
9.           CONSTRUCION OF THE GAS PIPEUNTES. Construction of offshore pipeline also does not cntail anv
significant environmental risks except very limited disturbances of the sea floor. The linepipe would be
taken to sea on barges and welded on a derrick-lay large and then allowed to sink and rest on the sea floor
within 60 to 70 m water depth. All pipelines planned under the project would be along a previously
surveyed route that is flat, avoiding boulders and any other obstructions that require blasting. To mini-
mize or eliminate shifting on the sea floor, the pipe would weighted with a heavy concrete outer coating.
To trinimize the risk of environmental pollubon after the pipeline is put into service, all materials usedi for
construction would be carefully inspected. The welding would be inspected by X-ray techniques and
hydrostatic tests. The risk of corrosion would be minimized by using adequate cathodic protection
methods. The pipeline would be equipped with automatic shut-off valve devices and metering systems to
give continuous comparison between input and output on all lines. This allows operators to discover
leaks immediately.

Environmental Aspects
10.         EXIPANSION OF tHE HAZJIA GAS TERMINAL. The construction of additional facilities at Ha_ira
entails no environmental risks. Some disturbances would, however, be generated from dust during the
site preparation and noise during the construction. Since the terminal is located in an uninhabited area,
these disturbances wouldi have very limited environmantal implications. When the additional facilities
are put into service, there would be, however, an increase in the environmental risks since similar facilities
are already operational within the terminal. These risks relate mainly to gaseous and liquid effluents.
Gaseous effluents could originate principally from the gas process itself, valves, compressors, storage and
loading facilities. The design of the terminal would be such that these effluer.ts would be collected by
vapor recovery, ventilating systems. The fact that the additional facilities would process 5 MMCMD of
sour gas to be constructed at Hazira with gas desulfurization and sulfur recovery equipment would
significantly reduce the amount of sulfur that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. With
regard to liquid effluents, three types of pro zess treatment would be provided, namely for rain water,
sanitary waste and process waste. Rain water would be collected in surge ponds and treated to remove
any oil and suspended solids. It will then be filtered and used in cooling systems or disposed of. The
sanitary waste would be treated in specially designed units. Process waste would be collected in tanks
and treated for removal of any oil and suspended solids. A-r flotation units would be used for removal of
emulsified oil. Recycling systems inci.u ;ng biological treatment would also be installed In addition,
good maintenance and inspection practices would be an effective approach to keep the terminal as
leakproof as possible

Note: Export credit assumed as PS% of foraign exchange cost with balance from ONGC
2.             The financing plan was developed in consultation with the Government and ONGC, taking
into account external resource availability constraints outlined in para. 3.25. Given the large foreign
exchange requirements - US$2.2 billion - and the fact that a more extensive use by ONGC of private source
borrowings did not appear feasible at this time, it was agreed that a combination of cofinancing sources
would be required to make this financing plan viable.
3.             ExroRr CREDrr. The effort was first made to maximize the use of official export credits, - a
source so far least used by ONGC - comprising direct export credit extended from export credit agencies
(ECAs) to ONGC, buyer credit offered by ECAs to ONGC, and/or credit to ONGC offered by suppliers
with the backing of their respective ECAs (and, possibly, with somne participation from the commnercial
banks supporting the suppliers). Following a request by ONGC for assistance in mobilizing the cofinanc-
ing, the Bank contacted a number of ECAs to ascertain the availability of credit and/or export credit
insurance to India. These contacts confirmed that an adequate volume of export credit would be available
to finance suitable procurement packages, e.g. linepipe. Based on inquiries made by ONGC, in some cases
also by the Bank, it was also established that most potential linepipe suppliers would be willing to provide
credit. 3ome suppliers indicated that they were prepared to arrange the financing of larger procurement
packages, such as platforms. ONGC decided that it would seek suppliers' and export credits for items
such as linepipe, compressors and the process platform SHG.

Project Financing Plan
4.         In order to ensure that the envisaged USS 745.& million in parallel cofinancing would be
forthcoming, ONGC intends to limit the bidding for the kind of packages ihdicated above to bidders
offering financing at most favorable terms and conditions applicable to India under the OECD Arrange-
nent on Officially Supported Export Credits ('the Consensus"), or better. The export credits extended to
ONGC under the Consensus could have repayment terrns of up to 10 years and fixed interest rates. All
responsive bids would be evaluated with prices and terms taken into account. (For evaluation procedure,
see Annex 4.4). The Bank will continue to assist ONGC in mobilizing cofinarcing from these sources.
3.         THE Ex  -lm[2T BANK OF JAPAN (1-EXIM). In order to secure additional cofirancing, the
Government applied in March 1991 for an untied facility from J-EXIM in the amount of US$350 million
equivalent. J-EXIM is currently studying this application. If accepted, the untied J-EXIM loan would
provide parallel cofinancing for the expansion of the Hazira gas terminal. Procurement would be carried
out under World Bank procurernent euidelines.
6.         THE ASIAN DEvELoPmFNr BANK (ADB). The envisaged cofinancing from ADB would finance
the procurement of the laying, coating and wrapping of the ICP-Heera and UPB-Hazira pipelines. ADB
would also finance the environmental component included in the project. Bank staff participated in ADB's
preparatory work for the participation in the proposed project, which has been included in ADB', FY92
lending program for India. ADB has informed the Bank that they expect Board approval for their partici-
pation in the proposed project in the first quarter of 1992.
7.         THE WoRLD BANK. The prcposed Bank loan has been allocated to several procurement
packages. Some of those are crucial and among the most complex components of the project, such as the
process platform NQP the component dealing with reservoir management. Others, such as 'pltform
modifications', are not suitable for export credit and, in isolation, of little interest to other cofinanciers.
Finally, components like Engineering and Project Management, and Studies and Training are considered
important for the Bank to be able to adequately play its supervising role and to provide techtical assis-
tance.
8.         The total amount of US$ 340.6 million in foreign exchange resources (including US$204
million in interest during construction), which ONGC is expected to provide is sizeable. However,
considering that this residual amount would be required over a longer period and that additional cofi-
nancing sources are still being explored, it is viewed as manageable by ONGC.

GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT                          a-ge I fl
Assumptions Underlying the Project Financial Analysis
Capital Costs                      The capital costs are based on ONGCs and the mission's esti-
mates of the cost of the various project components For the
purpose of calculating the financial rate of return of the project
these costs have been converted into their equivalent in 1991 US
Dollars. They include physical contingencies of 10% of the base
cost of the project components, taxes and duties estimated to
average 26% of the cost of items to be imported under the project.
The cost of upgrading of the HBJ pipeline to accommodate the
increased availability of gas has not been included.
Operating Costs                    The operating costs are based on ONGCs experience with the
operation of sirnilar installations. The annual expenditures have
been calculated as follows:
*        Repairs and Maintenance:
(i) 1% of the capital cost of the pipelines
(ii) 3% of the cost of all other capital iterms
*        Insurance:
0.2% of capital cost, excluding the costs of wells and
pipelines
Incremental Personnel Cost
Rs 6250 per staff/month for 20 staff
*        Overhead
US$ 2 million
Average operating costs amount to about 2% of capital cost.
Gas Price                          The currently prevailing price for gas is Rs 1400 per 1000 m3 (at
land fall points) and Rs 2250 per 1000 nis (along the HBJ pipeline).
These prices will be revised, as soon as the Govemment decides
to adopt the gas pricing policy proposed by the Bureau of Indus-
trial Cost and Prices. A decision to implement this pricing policy
is a condition of the nroposed loan. Implementation of this
policy would raise &Ls prices to Rs 1500 per 1000 m' to gas
producers, i.e. ONGC and OIL. The financial assessment of the
project is based on Rs 1500 per 1000 m'.

Assumptions Underlying the Project Economic Analysis
Background
1.              The aim ot the economic analysis is to judge whether there are enough benefits to justify the
commitment of resources for the investments to eliminate the flaring of gas in the Bombay High oilfield.
As described in Annex 4.2, the proposed project is part of a larger investment program (LI!-LIII project)
aimed at increasing oil output from the Bombay High oilfield. To recover the gas that is currently flared
as well as the additional gas that will become available as a result of the increase of oil output from the
LII-LIII project, ONGC needs to expand the capacity of the infrastructure for the recovery, transport and
processing gas in the Westem offshore region. Without these investments gas flaring would increase
dramatically.

2.              A review o; various alternatives for the recovery and transmission of gas carried out by
Engineers India Ltd. (Annex 4.1) has established that the proposed investments represent the least cost
means for eliminating gas flaring and transporting gas for use on shore. Hence, the costs and benefits are
defined not with respect to the next best alternative, but in relation to 'not doing anything at all', the
'without project situation'. ONGC does have the option to limit the LII-LIII project t" investments neces-
sary for increasing oil output and continue the flanng of gas. The approach is to L.rImate the incremental

cost and benefit streams associated with the proposed project and compute the economic indicators of the
project, the net present value at the opportunity cost of capital for India (12%), and the economic internal
rate of return (EIRR). The analysis period consists of th' construction time and the operating life of the
projft. Table I summarizes the main assumptions that were used in the economic analysis
Econormic Costs
3.          The financial flows were converted to economic costs by (i) netting out duties and other
dom 2stic transfers; tii) expressing the import content at c.i.f. prices; and (iii) applying shiadow prices to
don.estic components. A standard conversion factor of 0.8 was applied to all domestic costs.
4.          The costs include the required investments for the recovery and transmission of associated
gas in the Bombay High oilfield. The increase in gas supplies will require an expansion of the current
capacity of the HBJ gas pipeline from 22 to 33.5 MMCMD. While this expansion is not part of the project,
its costs were included in the economic analysis. Similarly, the additional gas pipeline from South Bassein
to Hazira will be used for the transport of gas from the South Bassein gas field as soon as associated gas
supplies from the Bombay High gas field are exhausted. The cost of expanding the capacity of the South
Bassein gas field were included in the economic analysis of the projet.
Economic Benefits
5.          Table I summarizes the assumptions that were used in the assessment of the economnic
benefits from the project. Although components of this project contribute to the objective of ONGC's
larger investment program (LII-LIll project) aimed at increasing oil production in the Bombay High
oilfield, only the volumes of gas that will be recovered and brought to markets onshore were taken into
ac, sunt in the economic analysis of the project. Similarly, the cost of the various components that serve
both the increase in oil uutput and the recovery of gas were apportioned to their respective outputs. The
volumes of gas and oil are shown in Table 2.
6.          Natural gas has been valued on the basis of the fuel which it replaces, delivered at the point
of use. For the purposes of the economic project evaluation, it has been conservatively assumed that all
gas replaces fuel oil, the lowest valued replacement. International prices of fuel oil were projected based
on the Bank's projections for crude oil prices, and adjusted for international transport to arrive at a cif
value at Bombay. Gas used at landfall points and along the HBJ pipeline has been valued at the thermal
equivalence of fuel oil cif Bombay.
7.          The use of natural gas yields additional economic benefits in the form of reduced storage
and handling costs, reduced maintenance costs as well as lower pollution. Further benefits result from the
increased thermal efficiency of natural gas relative to liquid fuels and coal, which typically result in a 5%
to 30% increase in benefits depending on the use and type of bumer. These additional benefits are par-
ticularly large where gas replaces coal. Although the magnitude of these savings varies from industry to
industry, their total impact can be libstantial. As a result, the project benefits as currently measured,
using, direct thermal equivalenc .  gas for fuel oil, tend to underestimate the benefits of this project to the
Indian economy.
