MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A SECOND TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 69.0 million (US$96.0 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 40 years, and would assist in financing a Second
Transport Rehabilitation Project. The project will be cofinanced by other
donors for US$66.0 million equivalent.
2.      Backaround and Strategy.  Ghana's transport infrastructure faced
virtual collapse during the early 1980's due to prolonged neglect of
maintenance and rehabilitation. This resulted in high transport costs and
serious bottlenecks in the transport system. When Ghana launched its
Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1983, with a series of sweeping economic
reforms, it was clearly recognized that removing transport bottlenecks and
improving transport efficiency were crucial to obtaining an adequate supply
response from the ERP process. Thus, under the ERP, Ghana undertook, with
considerable support from IDA and other donors, a program of emergency
repairs and phased rehabilitation of its transport sector, and has
initiated generally sound and pragmatic institutional reforms. These
measures are showing encouraging results and have helped avert further
deterioration of the system. However, there is still much more to be done
to restore transport infrastructure.
3.      The restoration of adequate transport capacity, particularly for
the road system, and the rebuilding of efficient sector institutions, will
take about a decade or more of concerted efforts. The Government of Ghana
(GOG) has sought IDA's support in designing and implementing these efforts.
The First Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP-1), which started in 1988
and is making good progress, marked the beginning of a phased program for
sector-wide rehabilitation and strengthening. The proposed Second
Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP-2) is the next phase of this program,
hopefully to be followed by two more to complete the program. These
projects constitute a well-conceived program for phased rehabilitation of
transport infrastructure.
4.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  This project will complement and
reinforce IDA's ongoing assistance to Ghana in various sectors, which is
already paying off in a quickened pace of economic recovery. It is based
on the transport sector strategy evolved between IDA and the Government,
and is a logical sequel to .arlier credits dedicated to better maintenance,
rehabilitation and more efficient management in this crucial sector. IDA's
help is needed to ensure appropriate institutional and policy reforms, and
to attract potential cofinancier support for the priority physical
investments that are essential to clear arrears in maintenance and
rehabilitation, until a sustainable level of normal maintenance is reached.



- 2 -
5.      Project Objectives.  The aim of the project is to continue to
sustain and accelerate Ghana's ongoing economic recovery by: (a) removing
physical bottlenecks to the expansion of exports, farm production and labor
mobility and facilitating private sector development through improved
maintenance and rehabilitation of the road and railway infrastructure;
(b) improving the efficiency of both the public and private sector
transport management through promotion of market-oriented policies,
institutional development, and training; (c) facilitating rural transport
by promoting appropriate low-cost technology; (d) poverty alleviation in
rural areas, and improving the lot of women; and (e) reducing transport
costs for both goods and passengers.
6.      Proiect Description.  The project would include the following
four main components: (a) road rehabilitation, which includes (i) a three-
year (1991-1993) time slice of the trunk road stabilization program which
aims at clearing periodic road maintenance backlogs over 1988-1997;
(ii) rehabilitation of six priority bridges as part of Ghana Highway
Authority's (GHA's) ongoing bridge rehabilitation program; (iii) design and
supervision consultancies for road and bridge works, including studies for
rehabilitation of three major trunk roads where Government is seeking
bilateral financing as future projects; and tiv) technical assistance for
management strengthening at GHA and Ministry of Roads and Highways (MRH);
(b) railway rehabilitation which includes: (i) sleeper renewal and other
improvements on the Western Line; (ii) provision of essential locomotives
and rolling stock mainly for replacement; (iii) strengthening management
and training; and (iv) studies on line-capacity constraints; (c) support of
Transport Sector which includes:  (i) strengthening Ministry of Transport
and communications (MTC), (ii) sector policy and other studies to assist
MTC in policy formulation and transport planning, and improvements in road
safety; and (iii) training programs for road transport operators and
mechanics in the private sector; and (d) Northern Region Pilot Scheme
comprising low-cost road rehabilitation in about 50 villages, training for
NGOs/villagers in road maintenance, and support for non-motor transport,
hand-dug wells and environmental improvements, with NGO and community
involvement, using appropriate labor-intensive technology; Amasachina and
the 31st December Women's Movement, two local grass-root NGOs run mainly by
women and active in many self-help projects in Northern Ghana, will be key
participants in the design and implementation of this pilot component.
7.          The total project cost is estimated at US$227.6 million
(including taxes, physical and price contingencies) with a foreign exchange
component of US$165.2 million (73Z). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. To fill the financing gap of US$66
million, the Government has approached France, UK, African Development
Fund, BADEA and the Netherlands. Cofinancing negotiations between GOG and
the cofinancing agencies are in various stages of progress, and final
agreements are expected during the first half of 1991. The IDA-financed
components will not be adversely affected by any delay in finalizing the
cofinanced components, except in the case of railway locomotives, where IDA
disbursement will be conditional on firm cofinancing arrangements (see
paragraph 8 below). Amounts and methods of procurement as well as the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the Status of Bank Group Operations in Ghana are



- 3 -
shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps IBRD 22088, 22089, 22090
and 22091 show the road and railway systems and main project components.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8945-GH, dated November 5, 1990 is being
distributed separately.
8.          Actions Agreed.  The Government (and GRC) have agreed to the
following actions, most of which have been agreed in recent IDA-financed
projects. These include: annual review with the Bank of the Government's
revolving three-year transport investment plans; phased reduction of excess
staff in port, railway and road agencies; reorganization of the road
maintenance institutions and systems, and an increased role for private
contractors; larger allocation for road maintenance under the Road Fund and
the budget with guaranteed funding, and assurance of regular flow of such
funding; adequate recovery of road user charges; establishing monitorable
targets for GRC leading to the progressive elimination of operating
subsidies; and rationalization of transport regulations. Further
assurances on continuing Bank-Government consultation on transport sector
investment plans, and on continuing with other reforms were also agreed.
Cofinancing for railway locomotives has been agreed in principle with the
Governments of France and the United Kingdom; if this or other cofinancing
for locomotives does not materialize, railway perform:rnce will be seriously
affected; IDA disbursement for railway components has been made conditional
on signing of the financing agreements for new locomotives and
rehabilitation of existing locomotives, or four new units in lieu thereof.
Other conditions of disbursement for the railway component include: (a) the
submission to IDA of GRC's audited financial statements for fiscal years
1988 and 1989; and (b) the execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Borrower and GRC.
9.          Environmental Impact.  The project is rated B for environmental
assessment. The project is not likely to have significant adverse effects
on the environment as it would involve primarily periodic road maintenance
operations. No significant new construction of infrastructure facilities
would be undertaken. Positive environmental impacts would be achieved due
to improved traffic safety on the project roads and improved transport
service throughout the country. The Northern Region Pilot Program provides
special emphasis on environmental improvements through tree-planting and
other components with community participation.
10.         Benefits and Risks.  The main project benefit would be a more
efficient and cost effective transport system that will stimulate a higher
level of economic activity in the country and higher employment. The
project would continue to remove physical constraints in transport
infrastructure, reduce transport costs for goods and passengers, and would
support exports, farm production, and the mobility of people. It would
help alleviate rural poverty in one of the poorest areas of Ghana, through
provision of improved roads, affordable transport means, employment
generation through labor-intensive road works and environmental
improvements, and provide a model for involvement of women and NGO's in
projects. Economic return from the overall project is 38Z, ranging from
25Z for rural roads, 29Z for rail rehabilitation, 45Z for trunk road
rehabilitation to 70? for bridge rehabilitation. There are no significant
risks associated with implementation of the physical components of the



projects. The main areas of project risks ares (a) for periodic road
maintenance and rehabilitation, assuring the adequate level and flow of
local funds from the Government, and avoiding delays in Government's
procurement decisions for major contracts; and (b) for the railway,
securing cofinancing for urgent replacement and overhaul of locomotives;
and provision by the Government of timely release of foreign exchange for
purchase of essential maintenance imports during 1991-92. Risks under (a)
have been minimized by getting the Government's agreement to continue the
Road Fund and to make prompt releases from the Road Fund and Budget; such
assurances have worked well under TRP-1. To reduce implementation delays,
Government assurances have been obtained to streamline its procurement
clearance procedures. Regarding (b), IDA disbursement for GRC components
is made conditional on signing of cofinancing agreements for locomotives
which are critical project items. Government assurances have been obtained
for regular and timely provision of adequate project counterpart funds,
including funds for purchase of railway spares; moreover, the procedures
for releasing funds for spares will be improved. Overall, project risks
appear moderate and acceptable.
11.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
