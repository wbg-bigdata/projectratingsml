Comments      these contributions are being implemented some with Bank assistance, and others
              are under preparation for eventual implementation (See Annex 7 for a summary
              of a subset of these).

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
    1. Sector Context at Appraisal. Mexico is expected to be disproportionately
       affected by climate change, in particular intensifying hurricanes, rising
       temperatures, more variable precipitation. The country‘s large and relatively
       exposed coastline along the Gulf of Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula are a
       frequent point of landfall for hurricanes. Overall climate change is expected to
       further reduce the country‘s already scarce water resources, with impacts on
       agricultural yields. Mexico was, at the time of Appraisal of the Climate Change
       Development Policy Loan (the DPL), the twelfth largest emitter of greenhouse
       gases (GHGs) in the world and the second largest in Latin America.
    2. At the time of Appraisal, Mexico had demonstrated a strong commitment to
       address the challenges of climate change. Mexico‘s strong commitment to the
       agenda had been demonstrated through concrete actions in the areas of
       institutionalizing the agenda, adopting related policy incentives, participating
       actively in international conventions and designing national strategies and
       programs that placed climate change at the heart of the country‘s national
       development policy. In addition the country has demonstrated outstanding global
       leadership throughout the climate change negotiations and has played a pivotal
       role in catalyzing agreements. Domestically the initiative has been led by
       SEMARNAT (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), which has
       displayed unwavering commitment to the climate change adaptation and
       mitigation agenda.
    3. Institutionalizing Climate Change. Recognizing the multi-sectoral dimension of
       the climate change challenge, the Government of Mexico (GoM) established the
       Inter-secretarial Commission on Climate Change (Comisión Intersecretarial de
       Cambio Climático, CICC), chaired by the Minister of Environment and Natural
       Resources (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) in 2005. 1
       CICC‘s mandate was to: (a) formulate national climate change strategies and
       incorporate them in sectoral programs; (b) coordinate the implementation of those
       strategies; (c) promote climate change research, and (d) promote GHG emission
       reduction projects. The CICC contains several working groups as well as the
       Designated National Authority (DNA) on Climate Change. A Consultative
       Council on Climate Change (Consejo Consultivo de Cámbio Climático),
       associated with the CICC, is composed of scientists, representatives of civil
       society and the private sector. Together these provide advice to the CICC and at

  The CICC is chaired by the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y
Recursos Naturales, SEMARNAT), the Vice-Minister of Environment serves as Executive Secretary, with ministers of
the following areas serving as members: the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production, Rural Development,
Fisheries and Food (Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación, SAGARPA), the
Ministry of Communication and Transportation (Secretaría de Comunicación y Transportes, SCT), the Ministry of
Economy (Secretaría de Economía), the Ministry of Social Development (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social, SEDESOL),
the Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía, SENER), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Secretaría de Relaciones
Exteriores, SRE). The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Públic, SHCP) is a
permanent invited member to the CICC‘s deliberations.

       the same time create a link between the CICC and the scientific community and
       civil society.
    4. Policy Incentives and Measures. The GoM had also adopted policy measures that
       fostered climate change mitigation and improved the knowledge base about the
       impacts of climate change in order to develop responses that would reduce
       vulnerability. Several fiscal measures were adopted, including direct federal
       budget increases that resulted in a doubling of Pro?rbol’s 2007 budget, allowing
       for the reforestation of 642,000 hectares--more than double the then estimated
       annual loss of forest cover. This was estimated to result in a reduction of
       approximately six million tons of CO2.2 The then recently approved 2007 Budget
       Law provided tax incentives for clean vehicles whereby new hybrid gasoline-
       electric cars were exempt from the tax on new automobiles. As a global first,
       Mexico has introduced a highly innovative ―Green Mortgage‖ program that was
       designed to unleash incentives for promoting markets in clean household products.
       The Budget Law also provided incentives to public agencies carrying out Clean
       Development Mechanism (CDM) projects by allowing them to keep the sales
       revenues of their GHG emission reductions. At the time, Mexico ranked fourth in
       terms of the number of CDM projects in the world (with over 100 projects
       registered by the CDM Executive Board) and fifth in terms of expected average
       annual emission reduction of GHGs. The GoM‘s sectoral programs initiated
       actions with both the public and private sectors to catalyze initiatives to adapt to
       climate change and decouple GHG emissions from economic growth.3 Finally,
       several programs aimed at designing local responses were under preparation,
       based on vulnerability assessments. Mexico City had adopted its Climate Change
       Strategy—the first of its kind in Latin America, considered a leading example of
       sub-national climate policy making—that included a GHG inventory and called
       for measures to reduce the carbon footprint of economic sectors, in particular
       transport.
    5. International Framework. Mexico was active in the negotiations leading to the
       1992 Rio Conference on Sustainable Development and the adoption of the United
       Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Mexico ratified
       the UNFCCC in 1993 and the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC in 2000. As a
       ‗non-Annex I country‘ Mexico is not required to have a ―quantified GHG
       emission limitation or reduction commitment‖. Nevertheless, Mexico had firmly
       adopted the UNFCCC principle of ―common but differentiated responsibilities‖


2
  The GoM introduced the Pro?rbol program in 2007 with the objective of consolidating different federal support
mechanisms to enhance the forestry sector, especially in the 101 least privileged municipalities. It is managed by the
National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) within SEMARNAT. The program issues competitive grants from
CONAFOR to requests submitted by organizations or individuals for improving forest planning, forest protection,
reforestation, developing commercial activities in wood processing, soil conservation, etc.

3
  Private sector engagement is recognized as being crucial to success and includes: about 80 private companies,
including some of Mexico‘s largest firms who had started reporting their GHG inventories under an initiative fostered
by the local chapter of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the largest industrial chamber in the
country, the World Resources Institute and SEMARNAT.


                                                          2
         which called for countries to participate in effective and appropriate international
         responses to climate change. Mexico stands out as a clear leader on climate
         actions, and has played a vital supportive role in global negotiations. All of this is
         underscored by its voluntary commitments to control GHG emissions. At the
         Copenhagen Conference of Parties in 2009 Mexico pledged to voluntarily reduce
         GHGs by 30% against a ―business-as-usual‖ trajectory of emissions.
      6. Mexico had submitted three National Communications to the UNFCCC, making
         it the only non-Annex I country to have submitted a Third National
         Communication at the time. The First Communication (1997) established the
         National GHG Inventory and reported the first studies on Mexico‘s vulnerability
         to climate change. The Second Communication (2001) updated the National
         GHG Inventory for the period 1994-1998, with improved methodologies and
         included future emission scenarios. The Third Communication (2006) updated
         the National GHG Inventory as of 2002 and included land-use change emission
         estimates for 1993-2002, and a number of mitigation and adaptation studies. The
         GoM had at the time of Appraisal announced its intention to deliver its Fourth
         Communication by 2009, and a Fifth Communication by 2012. The latter is only a
         requirement of Annex 1 countries and thus distinguishes Mexico among other
         developing countries.
      7. Mexico had also established a strong track record of phasing out ozone-depleting
         substances, in particular Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the consumption of which
         declined by over 98.6 percent between 1998 and 2007. Although CFCs are not
         included in the list of six GHGs in the Kyoto Protocol, their phase-out has a
         beneficial impact on the global climate and has other environmental co-benefits.4
      8. National Strategy. The need to address the challenges of global climate change
         has become a unifying, consistent and increasingly high profile theme of Mexican
         social and economic policy. The widely consulted 2007-2012 National
         Development Plan (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, NDP), had environmental
         sustainability as one of its four pillars. The main initiative in the NDP‘s
         environmental sustainability pillar is to turn the concept into a cross-cutting
         element of public policies and assure that all public and private investments are
         compatible with environment protection. On May 25, 2007, the President of
         Mexico announced the GoM‘s National Climate Change Strategy (Estrategia
         Nacional de Cambio Climático, ENCC) that placed climate change at the core of
         Mexico‘s national development policy5.

      9. The ENCC resulted from a two-year process that benefited from the preparation
         of technical and scientific documents of high caliber and consensus building
         among participants (that included nine CICC meetings, as well as a two-week
         public consultation that involved over two hundred persons from the public and


4
    CFCs are regulated by the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which mandates their phase-out over a certain period of time.

5
 Mexico‘s National Climate Change Strategy was referred to by the acronym NCCS in the Program Document. In this
ICR the acronym ENCC is used to be consistent with the acronym used by the GoM.


                                                            3
       private sectors and civil society). In the ENCC, Mexico committed to reducing
       GHG emissions on a voluntary basis. Finally, at the time of Appraisal, the GoM
       was developing a Special Climate Change Program (Programa Especial de
       Cámbio Climático, PECC), that would define how to operationalize the ENCC, in
       particular by identifying priorities and financing sources, both domestic and
       international.
   10. Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal. At the time of Appraisal (and loan
       approval), Mexico met the policy requirement of OP 8.60 for a sound
       macroeconomic framework. Mexico had maintained a solid macroeconomic
       framework that had succeeded in moderating output volatility and creating robust
       economic growth. The country had a consistent set of macroeconomic policies,
       within an inflation-targeting framework, a balanced budget fiscal policy and
       public debt management that favored the development of domestic capital
       markets. Details regarding the macroeconomic context at Appraisal are provided
       in Annex 8.
   11. Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The Bank‘s 2008-2013 Country Partnership
       Strategy (CPS) for Mexico, presented to the Bank‘s Board at the same time as the
       Climate Change DPL responded to the GoM‘s request that the Bank adopt a new
       business model of lending focused on few, key, cross-cutting areas coupled with a
       program of on-demand analytical and advisory services in support of those areas.
       This approach would be anchored in a large multi-sector DPL, focusing on the
       GoM‘s own reform program as contained in its NDP. The Climate Change DPL
       was the first in a series of DPLs that was to be processed under this streamlined
       lending approach, as it was considered to be central to the new CPS with respect
       to its theme (climate change), and was fully consistent with a centerpiece of the
       Government‘s NDP, its environmental sustainability pillar. Bank financial
       assistance would be supported by knowledge and advisory services, including an
       expanded set of analytical and advisory services that would be agreed upon and
       formalized under Memoranda of Understanding. The aim was to support the
       GoM and catalyze a generation of analytical and other Bank work in Mexico with
       a focus on this theme.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
   12. The Program Development Objective (PDO) of the Climate Change DPL was to
       recognize and support the Government‘s efforts under its National Climate
       Change Strategy to mainstream climate change considerations in public policy.
       The DPL was to provide overall budget support in recognition of the significant
       contribution that the ENCC was to make to Mexico‘s development agenda. The
       ENCC established the framework and represented the vital first step for
       confronting the challenges of climate change in a comprehensive and integrated
       fashion.

   13. The DPL was conceived as a single operation that would highlight Mexico‘s
       achievements in the climate change area and support its planned policy program.
       The operation was accompanied by a broader Memorandum of Understanding
       that defined the basis for an expanded dialogue on climate change. The DPL


                                           4
        focused on three then recently enacted actions that were synthesized in the form
        of the policy matrix below, and completed by the time of Board approval.

    14. A monitoring framework, including eleven monitoring indicators and
        corresponding expected outcomes that were considered strategic milestones in
        assessing progress in implementation of the ENCC was designed for the DPL (see
        Section 1.4 below).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification
    15. The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
    16. The DPL addressed all of the policy action areas of the ENCC, namely: (a)
        Mitigation; (b) Carbon Pricing in the National Economy; (c) Adaptation, and (d)
        Knowledge Base. In addition, it included an additional policy action area,
        Institutional Strengthening. The rationale is evident: mitigation and adaptation
        are key to climate smart development. Given that there are more unknowns than
        knowns in climate change, knowledge building and institutional strengthening are
        important in developing and refining policy, while carbon pricing remains the
        global instrument of choice (through the CDM) for reducing carbon emissions.
                                                 5
    17. Mitigation: The DPL was to support the critical steps required to collect, process,
        analyze and build consensus on the voluntary emission reduction targets that
        GoM was to announce to the Parties to the UNFCCC. The GHG emission
        reduction commitments were to be consistent with and integrated into the long-
        term national vision for the country and its 2007-2012 NDP. Indicators to
        monitor progress included:

i. Special Climate Change Program adopted. The GOM was developing the schedule
     of actions through which it would implement the ENCC. The document would
     encompass mitigation in all the critical sectors and seek to address those issues
     previously defined as priority for implementing adaptation initiatives.
ii. Sectoral contributions to the national mitigation effort defined. Each sector was to
     define its own contribution to the national GHG emission reduction effort.
iii. National emission reduction targets set. The GoM had made public its intention to
     adopt voluntary emission reduction targets as it led developing nations in the
     articulation of ―common but differentiated responsibilities‖. The selected set of
     indicators provided the sufficient conditions for enabling the GoM to voluntarily set
     emission targets. Achieving this goal was expected to confirm Mexico‘s commitment
     and demonstrate it leadership among developing nations, which could provide a
     model for other countries to follow.

    18. Domestic Carbon Pricing: The GoM understood the importance of providing
        clear guidance to all economic actors. The selected strategy was to utilize the
        processes that were initiated in the CDM. It was expected that the GoM would
        have the information, knowledge and public inputs required to assess a portfolio
        of policy options for reducing GHGs. The indicator to monitor progress included:
iv. Proposal for a national carbon trading system developed and discussed with key
    stakeholders. The ENCC at the time envisaged a domestic trading system that could
    build upon and develop the CDM.

    19. Adaptation: It was expected that Mexico would create the conditions for sub-
        national governments to prepare themselves to confront climate change impacts.6
        The indicators to monitor progress included:

v. At least five states committed to adopting a climate change action plan. Several
   states were expected to start developing climate change action plans for adaptation
   and mitigation. The GoM was to support these state initiatives by providing guidance,



6 The Stern report on the economics of climate change highlighted “This Review has assessed a wide range of evidence
on the impacts of climate change and on the economic costs, and has used a number of different techniques to assess
costs and risks. From all of these perspectives, the evidence gathered by the Review leads to a simple conclusion: the
benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting?. Moreover, it strongly argued that
“Adaptation to climate change—that is, taking steps to build resilience and minimize costs—is essential. It is no longer
possible to prevent climate change that will take place over the next two to three decades, but it is still possible to
protect our societies and economies form its impacts to some extent—for example, by providing better information,
improved planning and more climate-resilient crops and infrastructure?.

    information and technical assistance. This, together with initiatives at the city level,
    was expected to empower sub-national entities to take action against climate change,
    which was required for the ENCC to succeed.
vi. At least 10 cities among the most vulnerable committed to adopting a climate change
    plan. To support the implementation of the adaptation component of the ENCC, it
    was envisioned that several cities would develop climate change plans for adaptation
    and mitigation. The GoM was to support these initiatives by providing guidance, and
    technical assistance. Simultaneously it was recognized that city climate plans could
    be encompassed within state plans, in cases where spatial spill-overs and externalities
    are significant.

     20. Developing the Knowledge Base: Mexico had already been progressing at an
         extraordinary pace, collecting the information it needed to plan and implement
         policies and actions in the face of climate change. It was expected that in a 24-
         month time period, the GoM would continue to gather and analyze relevant data
         far beyond what was needed to fulfill its voluntary reporting commitments to the
         UNFCCC. The indicators to monitor progress included:
vii. Fourth National Communication to UNFCCC submitted. The GoM had made a
     significant commitment by announcing the preparation of a Fourth Communication, a
     major milestone without match in the developing world. Only Annex I countries had
     submitted a Fourth Communication.
viii. Feasibility of mitigation activities defined for priority sectors. In the context of
     limited budget resources, it was important for the GoM to know which mitigation
     measures were the most efficient and effective. Emphasis was to be given to the
     following priority sectors:      energy, transport, forestry and land use, waste
     management, agriculture and housing.
ix. Quantitative characterization of physical and economic impacts of climate change. It
     was considered important to improve the assessment of the likely physical effect of
     climate change (on human populations, water resources, infrastructure, agriculture,
     ecosystems, etc.). The physical assessment, together with its economic translation,
     would enable Mexico‘s authorities to make informed choices about policy measures.

    21. Institutional Strengthening: Success in the implementation of the ENCC was
        seen as a function of the strength of the organizational arrangements made.
        Leadership, accountability and training were considered necessary.            The
        indicators to monitor progress included:
x. CICC delivers its first progress report on implementation of the Special Climate
    Change Program. Implementation of climate change-related activities was seen to
    require a transparent and accountable institutional arrangement to increase the
    likelihood of success. The CICC was accountable to the President, Congress, and the
    population at large through its obligation to provide written accounts of the progress
    made in the implementation of the PECC. Its role would evolve from coordination of
    planning tasks to responsibility for coordinating the implementation of policies.
xi. Training of key federal institutions responsible for the implementation of the Special
    Climate Change Program developed. In an effort to further mainstream climate
    change policy, a number of key personnel in federal institutions responsible for

                                             7
      climate change would be trained, thus strengthening the capacity of ministries and
      implementing agencies.

2.1 Program Performance
      23. The Climate Change DPL of US$501.25 million was disbursed in a single tranche
          using the Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). The loan was fully disbursed by
          December 9, 2008.7 The Program‘s Performance, in terms of compliance with the
          Monitoring Indicators was strong. The status of compliance with actions selected
          as indicators is presented below.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
    24. Several factors had a positive impact on implementation, most notably, the
        GoM‘s strong commitment, the multiplicity of assistance vehicles, and a highly
        participatory approach to climate change issues. The actions monitored by the
        indicators in Section 2.1 were implemented during a severe economic crisis, yet,
        progress towards these actions was not delayed or impacted by Government
        budget shortfalls.
    25. Strong Government Commitment.            The GoM has demonstrated strong,
        sustained and unwavering commitment to both the global and its national climate
        change strategy and adaptation and mitigation agenda. This commitment was
        formalized in 2005 when it established the CICC and has grown increasingly
        stronger and sounder since that time. The GoM has embraced the notion that
        climate change has far-reaching economic, political and social consequences. It
        has firmly placed Mexico as a global leader. This commitment is best reflected
        through the actions and outputs that the GoM has taken and produced and the
        corresponding outcomes, as presented in Section 3.2.
    26. Integrated Bank Strategy. The GoM and the Bank have a long-standing
        engagement in the field of climate change that currently encompasses the full
        range of Bank instruments. The Bank‘s involvement with Mexico in this field
        dates back to the mid-1990s, when small investment projects in the areas of waste,
        transport and forest management laid the foundations of the climate change
        engagement. Programmatic Environmental DPLs, together with support through
        knowledge and advisory services, made the Bank‘s support for Mexico‘s climate

                                                      9
    change agenda in both adaptation and mitigation explicit. After formulation of
    the GoM‘s ENCC climate change was placed very much at the center of the
    Bank‘s assistance strategy. Support included this Climate Change DPL, which
    was presented to the Board for approval together with a CPS that proposed a new,
    more flexible and responsive approach to assistance formulation and delivery.
    This was followed by an Environmental Sustainability Development Policy Loan
    that supported the next phase of the GoM‘s climate adaptation and mitigation
    agenda. Subsequent DPLs both approved and under preparation continued with
    this trend – albeit with specific sector foci (e.g. water and climate change,
    adaptation and social issues). A trust fund that accompanied this DPL (TF93086)
    for climate change adaptation had a very short window of availability before its
    expiration and could not be made effective during this brief period when rules for
    grant allocations were under review and change in Mexico. Throughout, the Bank
    had a strong program of knowledge and advisory services, through a
    Memorandum of Understanding in the area of climate change (see below),
    complementary Sector Work, and support for the GoM in for example the
    preparation of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Investment Plan, in partnership
    with the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Finance
    Corporation. A summary of Bank assistance for Mexico‘s climate change
    adaptation and mitigation agenda is provided in Annex 7.
27. To say that an integrated strategy had a positive impact on program performance
    is not to imply that the size and composition of an assistance program drove the
    performance of a single operation. Rather it was the diversity of vehicles, i.e.,
    investment and policy-based lending, grant funding, knowledge, convening, and
    coordination services, and assistance in the design and preparation of new
    operations that provided a synergistic impact. The figure below provides a
    stylized summary of the catalyzing effects of this DPL.

28. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Climate Change. This DPL was
   the first operation processed under the new assistance modality for Mexico,
   whereby a central DPL, coupled with investment lending in supporting sectors,
   would be processed yearly. The purpose of this MOU with SEMARNAT was to
   enhance climate change policy dialogue, and further strengthen Mexico‘s capacity
   to mainstream environmental considerations into productive sectors as well as to
   implement its ENCC and PECC. The MOU was purposefully designed to be used
   flexibly to allow the Bank to respond to the GoM‘s needs and requirements over
   the two-year implementation of the DPL. The MOU comprised a variety of
   activities, including: (i) support to key studies, such as the MEDEC Low Carbon
   Economy study, the Economics of Climate Change in Mexico Study, and the
   Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan; (ii) assistance with preparation of Sub-
   national climate change strategies; and (iii) mainstreaming climate change and
   other environmental considerations into other sectors, including energy, housing
   and agriculture. This assistance modality of a DPL cum MOU was remarkably
   successful in elevating the policy dialogue, bringing needed, cutting-edge
   substance to that dialogue, leveraging additional funding through the Bank
   Budget for knowledge and advisory services. This DPL pioneered a modified

                                       10
   assistance modality that could be regarded as ―good practice‖ that may warrant
   wider replication.

29. Participatory Process. The GoM has established an open and participatory
   process in the design and implementation of its climate change adaptation and
   mitigation agenda that bodes well for effective and fluid implementation. At the
   highest level, the Consultative Council on Climate Change, associated with the
   CICC, creates a link between government, the scientific community and civil
   society. At the state level there is further innovation with the use of Climate
   Strategic Environmental Assessments conducted with Bank assistance to assure
   community consultation and buy-in.

30. The ENCC resulted from a two-year preparation process that comprised
    consensus building among participants (that included nine CICC meetings as well
    as a two-week public consultation among persons from the public and private
    sectors, and civil society). Additional public consultations were carried out for
    the PECC, for about three months in 2009. Comments and suggestions from
    ninety-seven persons and institutions were recorded in SEMARNAT‘s web page,
    including participants from schools, universities, research centers, NGOs, private
    sector firms, national and sub-national government officials, and rural producers‘
    organizations.
31. Economic Crisis. The risk (identified during Appraisal) that Mexico‘s growth
    prospects could be compromised, materialized. The Mexican economy's close
    links with the U.S. market, left it exposed to the center of the global economic
    crisis. Further, remittance flows that were critical to particular regions and
    vulnerable social groups also declined. Credit to the private sector declined and

                                         11
       economic activity fell by 6.5 percent in 2009. To add to the problems, Mexico‘s
       economic challenges were exacerbated by the A/H1N1 influenza epidemic in
       April 2009, which is estimated to have reduced GDP by 0.3 to 0.5 percent in 2009.
   32. The global economic environment, and its impact on Mexico, dramatically
       changed the projections of economic growth, public finances, and the public
       sector‘s external financing requirements. In light of this, the GoM requested
       multilateral agencies to expand their role in supporting programs and policies.
       The Bank responded to Mexico‘s request for increased external financing by
       securing approval for a US$401 million Supplemental Financing for the
       Environmental Sustainability DPL and a US$1,503.8 million Economic Policies
       in Response to the Global Crisis DPL. Despite the crisis, the GoM remained
       fully committed to the PDO, and has met all indicators for this DPL as envisaged.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
   33. As this DPL was to support implementation of a key pillar of the GoM‘s NDP,
       monitoring and evaluation of the DPL was dependent upon M&E of the Strategy
       of the ENCC. The DPL proposed a streamlined monitoring and evaluation
       framework that would allow the GoM and the Bank to assess progress towards the
       successful implementation of the ENCC over a 24-month timeframe. The DPL
       defined eleven monitoring indicators (and associated expected outcomes), as
       described in Section 1.4 and 2.1. The GoM and the Bank reviewed progress and
       SEMARNAT routinely provided updates to the monitoring indicators, as agreed
       at Appraisal.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
   34. Mexico‘s climate change adaptation and mitigation agenda remains very much at
       the center of the Bank‘s assistance efforts in Mexico. Since the time that the DPL
       was approved, numerous new DPLs in support of climate change have been
       approved for Mexico (see Annex 7). Of these, the Green Growth DPL is the most
       directly designed to consolidate and expand the initiatives supported by this DPL.
       Also, as a follow-up to this operation, the subsequent phase of Bank support to
       Mexico, has focused on continuing support to cross-sectoral activities and policies
       while beginning to mainstream mitigation and adaptation to climate change across
       different sectors, such as energy, transport, water, and forestry, and levels of
       Government. This continues to include a full range of instruments, including
       investment and policy-based lending, GEF and other grant funding, Forest
       Investment Program funding and knowledge and advisory services. Mexico‘s
       climate agenda is now gradually being transformed into a wider Green Growth
       engagement that encompasses near- and longer-term challenges of economic
       growth that will be actively supported by the Bank. The Green Growth Agenda is
       wider in focus than climate change and if properly structured would define the
       short term path to longer term ―climate smart development‖ – a term introduced
       in the World Development Report 2010 on Climate Change.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
   35. The DPL‘s objectives were and continue to be very relevant and closely aligned
       with the Government‘s NDP and the Bank‘s CPS. The Bank‘s CPS Progress
       Report continues to identify environmental sustainability as a key theme of its
       assistance efforts. Further, it highlights that given the strong environmental focus
       of the Bank‘s work in Mexico on infrastructure and energy, environmental
       sustainability has become an integral part of this effort and the package of
       knowledge and financing services being provided. On a broader level, the
       continued relevance of the DPL‘s objectives to the global climate change
       adaptation and mitigation agenda and to the reduction of GHG emissions is
       unquestionable.
   36. The DPL‘s design and its implementation, within the overall framework of the
       Bank‘s assistance strategy, continue to be highly relevant. The use of a DPL
       under the framework of an associated MOU proved to be a very powerful
       assistance modality for supporting climate change specifically, and environmental
       issues more broadly. The DPL served to attract the attention of sectors that were
       not focusing on environmental issues, and became a catalyzing vehicle for
       bringing them on board in support of the GoM‘s climate change agenda. It
       supported the broad, cross-sectoral activities and outputs that provided an overall
       framework for operationalizing the GoM‘s ENCC. In fact, several of the new
       operations in support of Mexico‘s program were designed with information and
       knowledge developed and provided under the DPL as noted earlier.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
   37. The DPL has achieved very successfully its objective that was to recognize and
       support the GoM‘s effort under its National Climate Change Strategy to
       mainstream climate change considerations in public policy. The DPL‘s impact on
       the design and implementation of the PECC was one of its major
       accomplishments.         More importantly the program was implemented
       expeditiously; several actions in the monitoring indicators were actually advanced
       in terms of timing, or exceeded in terms of numbers and coverage. Mexico has
       confirmed its leadership internationally on climate change, and reinforced its
       capacity and knowledge base to address it. Progress towards the actual results of
       different policy actions supported under the DPL varied. Recognizing the long
       term nature of the climate challenge, a key task was to set in place a process,
       whereby the states come on board with plans and actions, followed by other levels
       of government (as and when required). Through this process strong foundations
       and plans have been put in place, and, given the GoM‘s unwavering commitment
       it is likely that these plans will produce expected outcomes. Progress towards
       outcomes, presented by policy action, is summarized below and described in
       greater detail in Annex 9.

   38. Mitigation: Support the implementation of the critical steps required for the GoM
       to collect, process, analyze and build consensus on the voluntary emission
       reduction targets it is committed to announce to the Parties to the UNFCCC.
                                           13
39. As mentioned above, the PECC was a major, critical accomplishment in terms of
    impact on Mexico‘s climate change efforts. The PECC sets out a four pillar
    program that includes: (a) a long-term vision for government action; (b) sectoral
    plans for GHG mitigation; (c) plans for adaptation; and (d) cross-cutting policy
    initiatives. The cumulative effects of the proposed policy changes in the PECC
    are that Mexico‘s GHG emissions would reach an inflection point around 2020,
    and then decrease gradually to reach the target of approximately 340 million tons
    of CO2e by 2050.

40. Domestic Carbon Pricing: Produce the information, knowledge and public
    inputs required to assess a portfolio of policy options to internalize the effects of
    GHGs.

41. Through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Technical Assistance
    Project (P104731), the Bank provided technical assistance for the design of the
    Fondo Mexicano de Carbono (Mexican Carbon Fund, FOMECAR). FOMECAR
    is a nonprofit trust fund that provides technical assistance and financial support
    for CDM projects in Mexico. Between September 2008 and August 2009,
    Mexico secured the registration of 12 projects by the Executive Board of the
    CDM under the Kyoto Protocol. This resulted in a cumulative total of 118
    ongoing projects, of which 20 received Certified Emission Reductions (CERs).
    At the same time, CICC granted letters of approval to 22 projects, bringing the
    total number of projects to 217 by August 2009. Internationally, Mexico accounts
    for 7 percent of CDM projects and is ranked fourth for the amount of registered
    projects, fifth for the expected CER volumes and fifth in terms of CERs obtained.

42. Adaptation: Create the conditions for sub-national agents to prepare themselves
    to confront climate change impacts.

43. The GoM has recognized that many of the policies for climate change can best be
    designed and implemented at the state level. The Programas Estatales de Acción
    ante el Cambio Climático (PEACC, State Program for Climate Change Action)
    are instruments that guide the planning, design and implementation of climate
    change related public policies. The first state to prepare its PEACC, with
    assistance from the Instituto Nacional de Ecología (INE), was Veracruz in June
    2009, followed by the state of Nuevo León. Since that time, the process has taken
    off with other states following. The first Guía para la Elaboración de Programas
    Estatales de Acción ante el Cambio Climático (Guide for the Preparation of State
    Programs of Action for Climate Change) was prepared in February 2008 and
    updated in June 2009 to reflect the experience.

44. Progress in the development of municipal plans has been slower and remains
    highly challenging because the resolution and reliability of climate model
    projections decline exponentially with the level of spatial disaggregation. More
    importantly to deal with the adaptation challenge confronting cities it is usually

                                         14
           necessary to address problems far beyond the boundaries of urban areas at a wider
           spatial scale. Accordingly, urban climate risks are being tackled in the state
           action plans at the spatial scale that is most appropriate to the problem at hand
           (e.g. river basin for floods or water supply issues, coastal zone for hurricanes and
           sea level rise and so on) in the state climate plans.

      45. Knowledge Base: Continue to gather and analyze relevant data to fulfill
          voluntary reporting commitments to the UNFCCC, and to gather, process and
          analyze the costs and impacts of climate change at national and local levels to
          support policy formulation and implementation.

      46. The GoM, supported in part by several international partners, including the Bank,
          has invested heavily in building a strong and extensive knowledge base upon
          which it can develop programs and projects for climate change. The Bank assisted
          the GoM in assessing Mexico‘s potential for low carbon growth and the
          macroeconomic and fiscal implication of a low carbon development plan under
          the Low-Carbon Development for Mexico (also known as MEDEC) that
          identified and evaluated high-priority measures for reducing greenhouse gas
          emissions9. A second major study, The Economics of Climate Change in Mexico,
          served to inform public policy by assessing the cost of climate change in
          Mexico10 following and building upon the 2006 Stern Review on the Economics
          of Climate Change. It is notable in its academic rigor and employs a suite of
          modeling and econometric methods to inform the analysis. The results
          highlighted that climate change has significant impacts on Mexico‘s economy. It
          concludes that, ―without action the Mexican economy will suffer significant
          economic costs as a consequence of climate change? and “that it is better for the
          Mexican economy to actively participate in an effective international agreement
          than just face the economic costs of adaptation.‖

      47. The GoM also carried out a study on the social consequences of climate change in
          Mexico that analyzed the social effects at several levels. 11 The analysis and
          findings of the above and other studies carried out by the GoM, including Visión
          de México Sobre REDD+: Hacia una Estrategia Nacional and Distribución de
          los Costos del Cambio Climático entre los Sectores de la Economía Mexicana:
          Un enfoque de Insumo Producto, have already informed public policy, resource
          allocation and the design of sectoral programs, several of which are being
          supported by the Bank (Annexes 6 and 7).

   48. Institutional Strengthening: Strengthen and provide leadership, accountability
       and training to support the implementation phase of the ENCC.

   49. The Dirección General de Políticas de Cambio Climático delivered its first
       progress report on the progress towards implementation of the PECC that updates
       information on GHG emissions by sector and federal entity for the first two
       months of 2011, compares progress against expected targets, and updates targets
       on the basis of progress to date.

   50. About 700 officials of state and municipal governments, local academics,
       organized research groups and NGOs received training and attended workshops
       from 2006 to 2011. The training and workshops covered topics such as
       preparation of PEACCs, adaptation and mitigation of GHG emissions, generation
       and use of regionalized climate change scenarios, elaboration of GHG inventories
       and identification of adaptation and mitigation measures. Mexico‘s hosting of
       COP16 in 2010 also presented a unique opportunity for exposing Mexican
       government and other officials in a high level forum where climate change took
       center stage.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
   51. The Overall Outcome Rating is Satisfactory, based on the substantial
       achievement of the PDO, and the continued very high relevance of the DPL to
       global strategy and priorities, national strategy and priorities, and the Bank‘s
       assistance strategy. Mexico has been recognized as a global leader on climate
       change, willing to commit to targets voluntarily, and to define and design
       innovative programs, based on sound analytical research and knowledge. This
       DPL was but a small component in support of Mexico‘s climate change
       adaptation and mitigation agenda, but an important one in that it supported the
       mainstreaming of the agenda.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
   52. Climate change multiplies the existing vulnerabilities of poor people to extreme
       weather events as well as to longer-term perturbations. Although the DPL did not
       have a specific poverty focus, in the medium to long term, the framework,
       policies and activities that the operation supported and those that it set in motion
       should most definitely have a beneficial impact on the poor. Moreover in
       Michoacan the focus of the Bank‘s work with the State was on building adapative
       resilience of rain fed farmers – the poorest of the rural dwellers. Likewise in
       Campache among the issues addressed were problems with livelihoods in forests
       – again a poverty focused effort.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
   53. The expected outcomes of the DPL were directly related or associated with
       activities aimed at institutional strengthening, including strengthening
       SEMARNAT‘s capacity to provide knowledge and coordination. The training

                                              16
         through numerous workshops of government officials responsible for designing
         and implementing Mexico‘s climate change programs is a further aspect of
         institutional strengthening. Climate change has impacts at all levels and requires
         ongoing institutional strengthening across the economy.

n/a

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low
   54. The Risk to Development Outcome is Negligible to Low, based on:
    The DPL has achieved its objective of mainstreaming climate change
       considerations into public policy;
    The GoM has in place the mechanisms to accomplish this through the NDP and
       the PECC, and the institutional coordination mechanisms to sustain this objective;
    Mexico will unfortunately be disproportionately affected by the impacts of
       climate change, and the GoM has, as a result, recognized the need to act now.
       The GoM has demonstrated, and continues to demonstrate, strong commitment to
       the global climate change adaptation and mitigation agenda;
    The GoM sustained and, in fact intensified, its efforts in support of the NDP, the
       PECC, and its broader support to climate change despite the economic crisis that
       Mexico faced.

      55. The one factor that could impact sustainability is the forthcoming change in
          administration in end-2012, since the NDP and the PECC are for the 2009-2012
          period. Nevertheless, the sheer magnitude of programs and projects that embrace
          climate change that are under way or designed, and the solid institutionalization
          of the climate change adaptation and mitigation agenda in the public sector, make
          it unlikely that a future administration would completely backtrack on what the
          DPL supported. Further there is already high demand at state level.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
   56. The Bank program of climate change in Mexico, and especially the DPL that was
       instrumental in responding to the GoM‘s NDP, constitutes an excellent example
       of engagement with a sophisticated middle-income country in which the Bank has
       deployed the full range of available instruments to support the Government‘s
       program in a consistent manner. The preparation and approval of the DPL was
       timely, thereby seizing the opportunity to engage almost immediately with an

                                             17
       incoming administration that had climate change very high on its agenda. The
       DPL recognized the GoM‘s important accomplishments, and, together with a
       program of knowledge and advisory services under the framework of a
       Memorandum of Understanding, set out a program of activities, together with
       corresponding indicators, that responded to the client‘s needs. It is the activities
       in the MoU that has served to leverage a wider engagement across states and
       many sectors.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
   57. The Bank conducted periodic missions throughout a two-year period, focused on
       progress towards results in accordance with the eleven monitoring indicators.
       More importantly, however, in the broader sense, Bank implementation support
       was focused on working with the GoM, in particular with and through
       SEMARNAT, in the delivery of knowledge services as inputs to expected results,
       e.g., the Mexico Low-Carbon Study, intensive work for plans for State Climate
       Change in Michoacan and Campeche that subsequently fed into the design of
       policies in programs at the sectoral level.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
   58. Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on similar ratings for
       Ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
   59. Mexico‘s commitment to climate change generally, and to the DPL in particular,
       was unwavering. Despite constraints brought about by the economic crisis,
       budgetary allocations to the program were unaffected, and the GoM, from the
       highest level provided strong and unconditional support to the program. The
       hosting of the COP16, in end-2010, only reinforced Mexico‘s position and
       visibility as a leader in the field of climate change.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
   60. SEMARNAT is pivotal in all climate change policies and in implementing the
       PECC. Without SEMARNAT‘s leadership and commitment to the adaptation and
       mitigation agenda success would have been elusive. SEMARNAT has been
       closely engaged in monitoring progress and providing assistance, with mid-course
       corrections throughout.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
   61. Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on ratings for
       Government Performance and Implementing Agencies‘ Performance. Without
       sustained high level Government commitment and support to its climate change

                                            18
      agenda none of the achievements of the DPL or program would have been
      feasible.

6. Lessons Learned

   62. The DPL‘s implementation reinforces lessons learned that had been identified
       during preparation, both with respect to the Bank‘s previous support for climate
       change operations in Mexico, and with respect to good practice in policy lending.
   63. These included, for climate change operations, the need for: (a) strong country
       ownership; (b) strategic orientation and focus of the Bank‘s assistance; (c)
       mainstreaming climate change operations in investment and policy lending; (d)
       focus on a select number of central actions, impacts, and results; (e) inter-agency
       coordination as being critical; (f) learning by doing, and (g) sound analytical
       underpinning.
   64. Previous lessons also included four ―principles‖ of good practice in policy lending,
       including: (a) reinforce ownership; (b) agree up front with the government and
       other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework; (c) customize
       the accountability framework; and (d) choose only actions critical for achieving
       results as conditions for disbursement. The DPL‘s design took all of the above
       lessons into consideration, and they continue to surface as important lessons from
       its implementation.          The following additional lessons are worth
       expanding/highlighting:
   65. There is no substitute for Country Ownership. The GoM was, and continues to be,
       fully committed to its climate change adaptation and mitigation agenda. This
       DPL supports Mexico‘s program, and the country is increasingly recognized as an
       international leader in this area. Ownership at different levels of government has
       proven to be a driving force for success.
   66. An integrated Country Strategy, in which climate change programs and policies
       are addressed throughout with a full range of instruments, creates a virtuous
       framework for addressing the challenges. Granted, not all clients can support the
       number and diversity of operations and instruments that have been focused on
       climate change as that of the Mexico program. But it is the consistency with
       which the issue reappears in the Mexico partnership program (driven in large part
       as a reflection of the client‘s commitment), with a diversity of investment and
       policy operations not only cross-sectoral (such as this DPL) but sectoral as well,
       that has led to a highly focused and effective engagement. There are more
       unknowns than knowns in the policy and science of climate change, so technical
       assistance and a knowledge intensive engagement are especially important.
   67. A frequent consideration in whether policy or investment loans provide the most
       effective vehicle for supporting a government program often centers on the
       provision of technical assistance. In many cases, policy loans are processed in
       tandem with technical assistance loans (that often suffer implementation delays
       when the corresponding DPL is disbursed). This DPL was the first operation
       processed under the new assistance modality for Mexico that had been proposed
       in the 2008-2013 CPS, whereby a central DPL, coupled with investment lending
       in supporting sectors, would be processed yearly, under the framework of the

                                           19
       Memorandum of Understanding(s) that would set out knowledge and advisory
       services to be provided by the Bank in support of the government‘s program. The
       number of DPLs approved for Mexico increased dramatically above the amount
       proposed in the CPS, mostly to respond to the economic challenges that Mexico
       faced. Nevertheless, the model of DPL cum Memorandum of Understanding
       provided an integrated framework within which assistance was provided, not only
       for this DPL, but also for the several others that addressed climate change, to the
       benefit of the entire program. This new assistance modality also addressed the
       often-critical consideration as to whether development policy loans are the most
       appropriate vehicles in the absence of corresponding technical assistance.

   68. Finally, there are lessons about working through sub-national governments. It is
      unquestionable that many actions, especially with respect to adaptation to climate
      change are best addressed at the state level. What the federal government, in this
      case through SEMARNAT, did is to establish the broad framework, and provide a
      catalytic role with incentives to engage the states. At the same time, the capacity
      of sub-national governments varies greatly, and it is important to have in place
      mechanisms for supporting the weaker states.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
   69. The GoM strongly endorsed this ICR. In its comments, the GoM expressed that
       the ICR is a significant document that provides a sound record of the actions
       taken as agreed under the DPL. More importantly, it felt that the ICR highlights
       the GoM‘s important accomplishments with respect to climate change policies
       and actions and also to the close partnership that it has established with the Bank
       in this field. The GoM requested that the ICR clarify unequivocally that there
       were no clear linkages between funding under the loan and specific actions
       carried out by the various government agencies. The actions implemented by
       each of the government agencies were carried out with the ordinary budget
       allocation of each respective agency, and were not dependent on the Bank
       financing that was provided in recognition of achievement of those actions. The
       GoM also provided other minor comments, all of which have been incorporated in
       the ICR.

Annex 7. Summary of Bank Support for Mexico’s Mitigation of and Adaption to
Climate Change

    1. The Bank‘s program in support of Mexico‘s climate change efforts constitutes an
       outstanding example of engagement and partnership with a sophisticated middle-
       income client in which the Bank has deployed the full range of available
       instruments to support the evolution of the Government‘s program through the
       years in a consistent manner. The focus has been on using the existing range of
       Bank instruments in ways that build collective synergy and have delivered
       knowledge services combined with lending services.

   2. Recent Bank operations in Mexico in the areas of environment and Climate
      Change as well as their related Memoranda of Understanding for Bank Technical
      Support include:

Memoranda of Understanding, and other Technical Support

   3. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with SEMARNAT. The purpose of this
      MOU is to enhance climate change policy dialogue, and further strengthen
      Mexico‘s capacity to mainstream environmental consideration into productive
      sectors as well as to implement its National Climate Change Strategy and Special
      Program for Climate Change. The MOU comprises a variety of activities,
      including: (i) support to key studies, such as the MEDEC Low Carbon Economy
      study, the Economics of Climate Change Study, and the Clean Technology Fund
      Investment Plan, all of which have been completed; (ii) a legal and institutional
      assessment for implementation of the Special Program for Climate Change
      (PECC); (iii) preparation of Sub-national climate change strategies; (iv)
      mainstreaming climate change and other environmental considerations into
      energy-intensive and/or climate-prone sectors, including energy, housing and
      agriculture; and (v) design of a Cap and Trade System for Mexico. On the final
      point - Design of a Cap and Trade System - the Government of Mexico, with
      Bank agreement has decided that this would be futile and likely even
      counterproductive in the absence of similar actions by the main trading partners
      which was envisaged at the time that this study was agreed by the Bank and GoM.
      The focus was then shifted to MEDEC determining low hanging fruits of
      mitigation.

   4. The Environmental MOU with SEMARNAT follows the Mexico Environmental
      Sustainability Development Policy Loan (P0955l0), initiated in early 2008 and
      closed in late 2009. The DPL supported policy and institutional reforms to
      promote sustainable development with the overarching objective of balancing
      socio-economic development with environmental protection and improvement.
      The operation was intended to complement actions supported by the Climate
      Change DPL and to further pursue the general objectives of a previous
      Environment DPL Program, by integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral
      policies and programs of key development sectors--tourism, energy, forestry,
      water, agriculture, and housing--as prioritized by the Government of Mexico.

   5. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Technical Assistance to the
      Implementation of PROTRAM (Programa de Apoyo Federal al Transporte
      Masivo, Federal Support Program for Mass Transit) (P117624) is being developed
      as a framework of collaboration between the SCHP and the World Bank for the
      effective implementation of the PROTRAM. Work will focus on five areas: (a)
      support for the preparation of urban transport projects, (b) mass transit program
      performance monitoring, (c) support in the development of methodologies for
      evaluation and risk management, (d) contribution to the institutional organization

                                          30
   of urban transport at the federal level, and (e) support for capacity building
   activities, horizontal collaboration, and systematic analysis of urban transport in
   Mexico. As a part of this MoU, the Carbon Partnership Facility will support cities
   in developing methodologies for transport emissions trading.

6. Low Carbon, High Growth: Latin American Responses to Climate Change, the
   Bank‘s flagship report on LAC, provides a scientific background to the specific
   instances of policy engagement and operational work. The comprehensive study
   explores how the region‘s countries are exposed to climate change impacts and,
   on the flipside, what they can do to avert its effects, both unilaterally and with the
   incentives of a global climate agreement to be negotiated next year in
   Copenhagen by the United Nations.

7. Through the Mexico Low-Carbon Study (MEDEC), implemented from August
   2007 until mid-2009, the Bank assisted the Government of Mexico in assessing
   the country‘s potential for low carbon growth and the macroeconomic and fiscal
   implications of a low carbon development plan, highlighting Mexico‘s potential
   for reducing carbon emissions from specific sectors, including transport, power
   generation, and end-use energy efficiency. Based on a common economic cost-
   benefit analysis, the study estimates the net costs, emissions reductions, and
   upfront investment that would be needed to maintain carbon emissions relatively
   constant over the next two decades while meeting existing economic and social
   development objectives.

8. Through the CDM Technical Assistance project (P10473l), which was
   implemented by Centro Mario Molina and Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior
   or BANCOMEXT, the World Bank provided technical assistance for the design
   of the Mexican Carbon Fund and project screening and carbon finance due
   diligence. The project closed in March 2009.

9. By providing the Government of Mexico with an Institutional Development Fund
   (IDF) grant, the World Bank supported the government in its effort to strengthen
   institutional capacity by establishing a Climate Change Office (CCO). Likewise,
   the IDF supported the identification of economic instruments for the
   internalization of climate change concerns in economic planning.

10. The Energy Sector Memorandum of Understanding with SENER (P114892),
    implemented from February 2009 until May 2010, is another example of technical
    assistance to the Government of Mexico to further strengthen the country‘s
    capacity to implement its Energy strategy.

11. Through a fee for service Mexico Mass Urban Transport Federal Program
    (P110474), the Bank worked closely with Mexico in designing, creating and
    establishing PROTRAM. The resulting report, ―Programa Federal de Apoyo a1
    Transporte Masivo: Fundamentos del Programa y Lineamientos para su
    implementacion en el marco del FONADIN,‖ laid the foundations for PROTRAM.

                                         31
      This technical assistance program was implemented from late 2007 until August
      2008.

   12. Guidelines (Environmental and Social) for Scaling-up Wind Energy Development
       (P109850) reviewed and documented the lessons learned in wind power project
       implemented by the Bank in Mexico and a number of other countries, providing
       guidelines and recommendations for future projects on the management of
       environmental and social aspects.

   13. The Bank supported the GoM in the preparation of the Clean Technology Fund
       (CTF) Investment Plan (IP), which provides support for the low-carbon growth
       objectives in Mexico‘s 2007-2012 NDP and PECC. Preparation of the IP was led
       by the GoM and the Bank, in partnership with the Inter-American Development
       Bank and the International Finance Corporation. The IP addresses programs in
       three key sectors: urban transport, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. The
       choice of programs reflects a combination of the GoM‘s ambitious strategies and
       sector implementation readiness, as well as the development banks‘ capacity and
       focus, and priorities established by the CTF.

   14. The ongoing Sub-National Climate Change Program, is composed of a series of
       activities, including: (a) the Sub-National Climate Change Plans, financed by a
       grant from the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (SFLAC) and
       Bank budget. Its aim is to develop State Adaptation Plans. The Bank has been
       supporting three states (Michoacán, Campeche and Zacatecas) in capacity
       building, and has been providing technical advice related to climate change
       adaptation and risk management strategies; (b) the SFLAC grant for Local
       Sustainable Development, which aims to provide advisory services to develop a
       Municipal Climate Vulnerability Index and Guidelines for Municipal Climate
       Change Action Plans; and (c) the Cities Alliance Grant to support the
       Municipality of Othon P. Blanco in the State of Quintana Roo in developing a
       municipal sustainability and climate change strategy.

   15. The ongoing Strategic Engagement Program to Support Adaptation of the Water
       Sector to Climate Change furthers the partnership between Mexico and the Bank
       by strengthening CONAGUA‘s capacity to address the challenges that climate
       change and population growth pose to the security of the water supply needed for
       Mexico‘s economic and social development. This is a companion program to the
       water and climate change DPL.

Development Policy Lending

   16. Environmental DPLs I & II recognized and supported national environmental
       strategies on tourism, energy, forestry and water, some of them explicitly related
       to climate change. The overarching objective of the program was to balance
       socio-economic development with environmental protection and improvement.
       The program focused on: (a) mainstreaming environmental concerns in the

                                          32
   development agendas of key sectors-- tourism, energy, forestry and water--as
   prioritized by the GoM; and (b) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of
   local environmental management processes in Mexico.

17. The Climate Change DPL (P110849) supported efforts to mainstream climate
    change considerations into public policy. The operation consisted of policy
    reforms in three areas: (a) improved analytical basis for policy responses through
    the submission of a Third National Communication to the UNFCCC; (b) the
    approval of the National Climate Change Strategy by the government‘s
    Intersecretarial Commission on Climate Change and its announcement by the
    president; and (c) the integration of climate change considerations in sector
    programs.

18. Environmental Sustainability DPL (P095510), the third in a series of policy
    lending operations to support environmental management in Mexico, built on
    environmental mainstreaming efforts and reforms initiated under the
    Environmental DPLs I & II. The DPL continued integration of environment and
    sustainability concerns into energy, tourism, water and forestry sectors with
    established environmental agendas, and also reinforced environmental
    components in two new sectors: housing and agriculture. This DPL was prepared
    in parallel with the Climate Change DPL.

19. The Green Growth DPL (P115608) supported stimulus of the economy while
    strengthening the framework for long-term sustainable growth by further
    developing the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for low emissions
    evolution of the transport and energy sectors. The DPL supported policy areas
    that aimed to: (a) implement a verifiable, targeted and cross-sectoral strategy for
    emission reductions; (b) establish institutions, regulations and monitoring
    capacity to allow for the reduction of emissions in urban transport, energy
    generation and efficiency, and (c) institutionalize the appropriate financing
    mechanisms to allow for the reduction of emissions in urban transport, energy
    generation and efficiency.

20. Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector DPL (P120134) supported the
    GoM‘s efforts to strengthen the institutional framework and monitoring capacity
    in integrated water resources management and mainstreaming adaptation to
    climate change in water programs.

21. The Low-Carbon DPL (P121800) supported sector-specific, high-priority policy
    and regulatory reforms that had been identified as critical to achieve Mexico‘s
    climate change mitigation targets under the PECC for: (a) increasing renewable
    energy supply, promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration, reducing gas
    flaring and venting; (b) improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road
    transport operations in Mexico; (c) strengthening the market for energy-efficient
    housing; and (d) mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and
    forestry activities.

                                        33
   22. The proposed Strengthening Social Resilience to Climate Change DPL (P120170)
       seeks to reduce the impacts of climate change on the poor through policies to: (a)
       promote sustainable territorial development and reduce vulnerability to natural
       disasters; (b) strengthen long-term climate change adaptation planning; and (c)
       implement pro-poor climate change mitigation measures in the forestry sector.
       These are complemented by advisory services at the state and municipal level,
       knowledge and advisory services related to social programs for disaster risk
       reduction, and a comprehensive support package to forest management.

Investment Operations

   23. Water Utilities Efficiency Improvement Project (P121195) aims to improve the
       efficiency of participating water utilities. A first component aims to improve
       water supply and sanitation institutions‘ capacity with regard to efficiency
       improvements through management information activities and management
       knowledge activities.      A second component supports modernization of the
       services of participating water utilities.

   24. Protected Areas System Project (SINAP II, now closed) The consolidation of the
       protected areas system project for Mexico promoted the conservation and
       sustainable use of biodiversity in Mexico through the consolidation of the
       National System Protected Areas (SNAP) by: conserving globally important
       biodiversity in selected areas of SNAP through an endowment fund; promoting
       the economic, social and environmental sustainability of productive activities in
       selected protected areas; promoting social co-responsibility for conservation; and
       in general, promoting the inclusion of biodiversity conservation and sustainable
       criteria in development projects and other practices affecting selected protected
       areas. This project (now closed) extended the protected areas program initiated
       with GEF funding in 1992 and restructured as an endowment funds to support
       conservation of 10 protected areas in 1997 (Project SINAP l), by adding 12 new
       protected areas to the program.

   25. Environmental Services Project (now closed) sought to increase substantially the
       development of markets for environmental services in Mexico. The project
       consisted of the following components: Component 1 focused on developing
       sustainable financing mechanisms. Component 2 activities supported the
       development and strengthening of payment delivery mechanisms for
       environmental services. Component 3 supported environmental service providers.
       The actual flow of payments to participants and the ongoing operational costs of
       the program were tracked under Component 4. Finally, Component 5 financed
       project management.

   26. The Sustainable Rural Development Project (P108766 and P106261) is
       promoting the adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies in agri-
       businesses. There are four components to the project. The first component is the

                                          34
   investments in environmentally sustainable technologies in agribusinesses. The
   project promotes investments in environmentally sustainable technologies in agri-
   businesses operating at the various stages of the production chain of agricultural
   products. Though the project primarily focuses on existing agri-businesses,
   support to new agri-businesses could be considered on a case-by-case basis,
   mainly for the introduction of solar thermal systems. The second component is the
   investment and production support services. In order to ensure quality at entry of
   investment sub-project proposals, this component will partially reimburse
   beneficiaries for the costs associated with business plan preparation for sub-
   projects, including the energy diagnostic when necessary. It will also provide
   beneficiaries with technical assistance for implementation of their proposed
   business plan, as well as training to integrate technologies promoted through the
   project in their farms and agri-businesses. The third component is the institutional
   strengthening. Activities to be financed by the project under this component will
   include assistance for policy development to address issues related to climate
   change and the environmental impact of sub-projects, in particular, institutional
   strengthening of areas within Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production,
   Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) that will address the targets
   outlined within the National Strategy on Climate Change and the President's
   Special Program for Climate Change (PECC).

27. Forests and Climate Change Investment Program (proposed FY12) will deploy
    various instruments, including technical assistance (e.g., South-South
    collaboration on REDD), policy advice, convening services (e.g., the Forest
    Carbon Partnership Facility), institutional strengthening and direct support to
    communities (e.g., a proposed Forest and Climate Change SIL, and Forest
    Investment Program), and the piloting of innovative financial services (including
    a possible Forest Bond with the Bank‘s Treasury Department).

28. The proposed Modernizing the National Meteorological Service to Address
    Variability and Climate Change in the Water Sector in Mexico would strengthen
    the capacity of the National Meteorological Service (SMN) to meet the increasing
    demand for weather and climate information in order to improve water resources
    management and support sustainable development in the face of climate change.
    The Project will enable SMN to enhance its effectiveness as a modern
    organization that provides reliable, useful and timely information on meteorology,
    climatology and hydrometeorology and align SMN‘s service and products with its
    international commitments. This will support decision making in a range of
    sectors, including the water sector, agriculture and other productive sectors, to
    increase productivity, support sustainable development, and protect life and
    property from the effects of natural disasters of hydro-meteorological origin.

29. The overall, long-term objective of the proposed World Bank/FCPF engagement
    in Mexico is to help Mexico reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and
    forest degradation, sustainably manage forests, and conserve and enhance forest
    carbon stocks (REDD+) in a socially and environmentally sound manner, while

                                       35
   accessing international financial incentives for local forest uses, thereby helping
   to mitigate climate change at the global level. The World Bank/FCPF
   engagement with Mexico is expected to involve two phases, generally referred to
   as ―REDD readiness preparation‖ and ―REDD implementation‖. The REDD
   preparation phase consists of analytical work and consultations that are expected
   to be supported under a proposed US$3.6 million grant from the FCPF Readiness
   Fund for a Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Readiness Preparation Grant
   Project (P120417).

30. Adaptation to Climate Change in the Coastal Wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico
    (P100438), partially financed by a GEF grant, promotes adaptation to climate
    impacts in the coastal wetlands of the Gulf of Mexico, and will assess the overall
    impacts of climate change and potential response options, with a focus on coastal
    wetlands and associated watersheds.

31. The Bank has supported Mexico through the Mexican Medium Size Cities
    Transport Program (P007648), which strengthened local agencies and supported
    the federal urban transport decentralization process. This project also helped cities
    develop their first Integrated Transport Plans (ITP), a comprehensive approach to
    transport planning at the city level. Having an ITP is required for a city to
    participate in the PROTRAM and the UTTP.

32. The Urban Transport Transformation Program or UTTP (P107159) is a
    comprehensive urban transport intervention loan (with a contribution from the
    CTF) that particularly emphasizes the development of mass transit, NMT, and
    introduction of low-emissions vehicles. Its aim is to improve the long-term
    sustainability, efficiency and quality of urban transport in Mexico, and reduce
    GHG emissions and local criteria pollutants. Through BANOBRAS, the UTTP-
    CTF loan will allow cities to receive credits at significantly lower rates than
    market rates for projects that contribute to placing urban transport in low-carbon
    growth path.

33. The Sustainable Transport and Air Quality (STAQ) Project (P114012), a Global
    Environment Facility (GEF) operation will offer grants for preparing projects in
    four Mexican cities (Puebla, Monterrey, Leon, and Ciudad Juarez), all o f which
    are currently part of the PROTRAM pipeline of projects. It will thereby help
    reduce the amount of COz and air pollutants by facilitating the use of public
    transportation and non-motorized modes, as well as planning for physical
    investments and regulatory frameworks that reduce the need for excessive
    movement of people and goods. Likewise, the project will facilitate the ability of
    policy makers, civic leaders, and technical staff in cities to articulate a sustainable
    transport vision adapted to local conditions, and to identify concrete and
    measurable steps to move toward that vision. Finally, it will facilitate the ability o
    f cities to share knowledge, information, and methodologies relevant to their
    development of sustainable transport visions.

34. The Anchoring Gender in Transport and Development Policies of Urban Cities in
    Mexico This initiative, associated with the Urban Transport Transformation
    Project (UTTP), intends to mainstream gender in the transformation process to a
    BRT system in the city of Leon. The is financed by the Gender Action Plan
    (GAP) multi-donor trust fund and is closely tied to GEF financing from the
    Sustainable Transport and Air Quality initiative, involved in the preparation of
    the transformation process from the bus system to the BRT in the city of Leon.
    The ―Anchoring Gender‖ project will address gender through three specific
    activities: (i) the design of BRT routes and/or other transport programs, (ii) the
    ownership acquisition and transition from the traditional bus system to the
    industrial BRT scheme, and (iii) the operation of the new BRT system.

35. Introduction to Climate Friendly Measures in Transport (P059161) is a GEF-
    financed project, completed in March 2009, that assisted the Government of
    Mexico in developing policies and measures for stimulating a long-term modal
    shift toward climate-friendly, more efficient and less polluting, less carbon
    intensive transport in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The
    operation also supported aspects of the Third Air Quality Management Plan
    (AQM-1112002-20 10).

36. Mexico City--Insurgentes Bus Expansion Program (P082656), aims to reduce
    local airborne pollutants and GHG emissions from the transport sector in the
    Metropolitan Area of Mexico City through the development of the first surface
    mass transport corridor in Mexico City (Insurgentes Avenue) and associated
    traffic management measures.

37. Mexico: Low Carbon Bus Corridor Project (P106305) will contribute to the
    transformation of the transport sector through improvements in the long-term
    sustainability, efficiency and quality of urban transport in Mexico City. The
    improvements sought (expansion of the bus corridor program, the maximization
    of modal shift, and the use low carbon bus technologies) will result in major
    reductions in GHG emissions and local criteria pollutants.

38. The Hybrid Solar Thermal (P066426) project (GEF funded) aims to demonstrate
    and encourage replication of the Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Systems
    (ISCCS) power generation technology in Mexico and elsewhere, thereby
    contributing to the reduction of global GHG emissions.

39. The Integrated Energy Services (P095038) project supports the use of renewable
    energy in rural areas for the provision of electricity.

40. The Large-Scale Renewable Energy Development GEF Project (P077717) is
    being financed through GEF funds, and aims to assist Mexico in developing
    initial experience in commercially-based grid-connected renewable energy
    applications by supporting construction of an approximately 101 MW IPP wind



                                       37
   farm, while building institutional capacity to value, acquire, and manage such
   resources on a replicable basis.

41. Wind Umbrella, or La Venta II (P080104), a carbon finance operation, aims to
    reduce GHG emissions from power generation by 4 million tons CO2e over a 20-
    year operation period, promote investment in wind energy, and contribute to
    further development of the international carbon market in Mexico. The Emissions
    Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA) was signed on December 12, 2006, and
    the closing date for the project is December 31,2019.

42. The Mexico Biomass Residues Based Co-generation Project (P109794) is a
    Carbon Finance project of the amount of US$7 million, fully funded by the
    Bank‘s administered carbon funds. The ERPA i s expected to be signed by the
    end of FY2010. The Grupo Modelo Biomass Residues Based Co-generation
    Project consists of the replacement of fossil fuel used for heat and electricity
    generation at the brewery, specifically replacement of heavy fuel oil by biomass.
    The Bank has requested a revision of the methodology to include the use of waste
    bagasse to generate electricity.

43. Renewable Energy Management Transition Initiative (REMTI) - The ESMAP
    Trust Fund under the REMTI is supporting a 2- to 3-year program of just-in-time
    advice, TA and analytical work to design, disseminate and implement policies
    pertaining to the use of Renewable Energy.

44. The Mexico Lighting and Appliances Efficiency Project (P106424), a CTF project,
    will help Mexico in increasing efficient use of energy and thus support its efforts
    to mitigate climate change. The project is being financed through IBRD, CTF and
    GEF funds, and is expected to include four components: (i) replacement of
    incandescent light bulbs with CFLs; (ii) replacement of inefficient refrigerators
    and air-conditioners; (iii) measures to increase the efficiency of street lighting in
    municipalities; and (iv) technical assistance and institutional strengthening of
    relevant energy sector agencies to operationalize and implement the new Energy
    Efficiency Law. By implementing targeted energy efficiency measures, this
    project will help the country enhance its energy security, while lowering prices
    through avoided incremental investments.

Annex 8: Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal

      1. At the time of Appraisal of the DPL, the Mexican Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
         had grown at an average annual rate of 3.8 percent from 2004-2007. With its
         close links to the US economy, the global economic expansion that occurred
         during this period contributed to the country‘s rapid increase in exports.
         Enhanced price stability contributed to buoyant growth of domestic demand partly
         fueled by improved purchasing power of wages and salaries and an expansion of
         domestic credit and consumer lending. The evolution of the main macroeconomic
         indicators over the preceding five years confirmed a picture of robust growth with
         healthy internal balances that contributed to a significant reduction of
         vulnerabilities to external shocks (Table 1).

      2. At the time of Appraisal (and loan approval), Mexico met the policy requirement
         of OP 8.60 for a sound macroeconomic framework. Mexico had maintained a
         solid macroeconomic framework that had succeeded in moderating output
         volatility and creating robust economic growth. The country had a consistent set
         of macroeconomic policies, including monetary policy within an inflation-
         targeting framework, a flexible exchange rate, a balanced budget fiscal policy and
         public debt management that favored the development of domestic capital
         markets.

      3. The Mexican public sector remained heavily dependent on oil revenue that in
         2007 represented 35 percent of total public sector revenue, whereas non-oil tax
         revenue remained at a more modest 10 percent of GDP. Oil production had
         dropped from a high of about 3.4 million barrels per day in 2004 to about 3.1
         million barrels per day in 2007. Proven oil reserves were in the order of 10 years
         of production, and Mexico was the only major oil producer to have suffered a

     Part of this drop was due to a change in the methodology for assessing oil reserves.

       proposed and obtained legislative approval for structural reform to the federal
       government workers‘ pension scheme and a broad fiscal reform package. The
       fiscal reform package was projected to increase tax revenue by 1.1 percent of
       GDP in 2008 to 2.1 percent in 2012, thereby compensating for the expected
       decline in oil revenue over the period and allowing for an increase in public
       spending for infrastructure.

   4. The global slowdown of economic activity at the time of Appraisal was
      weakening Mexico‘s short-term economic growth prospects. The sharper-than-
      expected slowing of economic activity in the United States was seen as likely to
      affect Mexico more than other countries. Mexican industrial production is highly
      correlated with the health of the United States economy following the increased
      economic integration that resulted from the North American Free Trade
      Agreement (NAFTA). The GoM had reduced its growth forecast to 2.8 percent in
      2008. Still, the slowing of economic activity in the United States was seen as
      posing an important risk to the Mexican economy, and Mexico‘s growth prospects
      could be even lower depending on the severity of the deceleration of the U.S.
      economy. The GoM‘s NDP aimed at enhancing economic growth and aspired to
      reach an annual economic growth rate of 5 percent towards the end of the
      administration in 2012. Bank staff had projected a return to trend growth at about
      3.5-4.0 percent annually by 2009-2011, after a modest slowdown of economic
      activity in 2008 (Table 2).

Annex 9: Detailed Description of Achievement of the Program Development
Objective

   1. The DPL has achieved its objective that was to recognize and support the GoM‘s
      effort under its National Climate Change Strategy to mainstream climate change
      considerations in public policy. The DPL‘s impact on the design and
      implementation of the PECC was one of its major accomplishments. Mexico has
      confirmed its leadership internationally on climate change, and reinforced its
      capacity and knowledge base to address it. Progress towards the actual results of
      different policy actions supported under the DPL varied, with less direct, visible
      results under the adaptation actions, in view of the longer-term horizons and the
      significant lags between actions and outcomes. Recognizing the long term nature
      of the climate challenge, a key task was to set in place a process, whereby the
      states come on board with plans and actions, followed by other levels of
      government (as and when required). Through this process strong foundations and
      plans have been put in place, and, given the GoM‘s unwavering commitment it is
      likely that these plans will produce expected outcomes.

   2. Mitigation: Support the implementation of the critical steps required for the GoM
      to collect, process, analyze and build consensus on the voluntary emission
      reduction targets it is committed to announce to the Parties to the UNFCCC.

   3. The GoM designed and adopted the PECC in 2009 as its over-arching instrument
      for combating climate change, and for making its ENCC operational. The PECC
      sets out a four pillar program that includes: (a) a long-term vision for government
      action; (b) sectoral plans for GHG mitigation; (c) plans for adaptation; and (d)
      cross-cutting policy initiatives. Under the long-term vision, the PECC establishes
      an indicative target of reducing GHG by 50 percent by 2050, against a baseline of
      2000.

   4. The PECC notes that the mitigation effort the GoM intends to develop requires
      transformations in energy use, natural resource management and in the ways that
      land is occupied and used. For adaptation, the PECC defines three stages. The
      first stage of the long-term vision is defined as the period 2008-2012, in which the
      GoM‘s program will focus on evaluation of Mexico‘s vulnerability to climate
      change and economic valuation of the priority measures for intervention. In a
      second stage, from 2013-2030, the GoM‘s program will focus on strengthening
      Mexico‘s strategic adaptation capacities, including as priorities: (a) attaining
      equilibrium between degradation/deforestation and restoration/reforestation; (b)
      the adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture and livestock
      production systems; (c) the eradication of measures that encourage environmental
      degradation and cause GHG emissions; (d) the implementation of relocation
      programs for human settlements and infrastructure in high risk areas, and (e) the
      implementation of policies aimed at climate stability and sustainable development.
      The final, consolidation stage, from 2030 to 2050, will seek to attain a positive
      balance between reforestation and deforestation, development options that ensure

                                           41
   environmental sustainability, and a strengthened national planning system based
   on criteria to decarbonize the economy.

5. The cumulative effects of the proposed policy changes in the PECC—which
   include urban transport development, energy efficiency improvements, renewable
   energy, reduced deforestation, adoption of new industrial processes as well as
   other measures that produce varying levels of emission reduction, are that
   Mexico‘s GHG emissions would reach an inflection point around 2020, and then
   decrease gradually to reach the target of approximately 340 million tons of CO2e
   by 2050.

6. The PECC considers that efforts to adapt to climate change, focused on reducing
   Mexico‘s vulnerability are a high priority. Finally, the PECC addresses issues
   with respect to policy mainstreaming, especially the need to assure intersectoral
   and inter-institutional coordination through policy mainstreaming. The PECC
   also prioritizes Mexico‘s involvement within a multilateral framework, and the
   importance of a continuous updating process to adjust the PECC in a dynamic
   environment, both nationally and globally. A list of studies and activities is
   provided in Annexes 6 and 7.

7. Domestic Carbon Pricing: Produce the information, knowledge and public
   inputs required to assess a portfolio of policy option to internalize the effects of
   GHGs.

8. Through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Technical Assistance
   Project (P104731), which was implemented by the Centro Mario Molina and
   Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Nacional Bank of Foreign Commerce,
   BANCOMEXT), the Bank provided technical assistance for the design of the
   Fondo Mexicano de Carbono (Mexican Carbon Fund, FOMECAR). This
   includes project screening and carbon finance due diligence. FOMECAR is a
   nonprofit trust fund that provides technical assistance and financial support for
   CDM projects in Mexico. FOMECAR contributes to the ENCC by creating a
   mechanism to collect and channel resources to: (a) promote and identify potential
   projects in Mexico that are eligible for the CDM and/or whose characteristics
   reduce GHG emissions so they can be registered and implemented through the
   CDM or other mechanisms; (b) provide technical and financial assistance for
   projects developed in Mexico eligible for the CDM and/or other mechanisms aim
   to reduce GHG emissions, and (c) implement actions to promote the reduction of
   GHG emissions in Mexico. BANCOMEXT acts as a founding trustee and grantor
   through FOMECAR, on the one hand, and as a fund operator through its
   Promotion Business Division, on the other.

9. FOMECAR is governed by its Technical Committee, which is comprised of four
   primary members appointed by BANCOMEXT and the Centro Mario Molina.
   The Technical Committee includes also permanent guests from SEMARNAT,
   from the CICC represented by SENER, and two representatives from SHCP.

                                        42
    Activities supported by FOMECAR include: (a) corporate training on CDM
    projects, workshops and seminars; (b) technical assistance for project feasibility;
    (c) financial support to prepare Project Design Documents, and (d) validation and
    registration expenses for project that could potentially generate low carbon under
    the CDM or other alternative markets.

10. Between September 2008 and August 2009, Mexico secured the registration of 12
    projects by the Executive Board of the CDM under the Kyoto Protocol. This
    resulted in a cumulative total of 118 ongoing projects, of which 20 received
    Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). At the same time, CICC granted letters of
    approval to 22 projects, bringing the total number of projects to 217 by August
    2009. Internationally, Mexico accounts for 7 percent of CDM projects and is
    ranked fourth for the amount of registered projects, fifth for the expected CER
    volumes and fifth in terms of CERs obtained.

11. Adaptation: Create the conditions for sub-national agents to prepare themselves
    to confront climate change impacts.

12. The GoM has recognized that many of the policies aimed at mitigation of GHG
    emission and adaptation to climate change can best be designed and implemented
    at the state and municipal level, for two reasons. First, decentralized authorities
    have a more detailed understanding of local problems and capabilities. By
    decentralizing the development of state and local plans, local authorities will have
    greater ownership of those plans. Also, many of the measures that will need to be
    taken for both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change fall under the
    responsibility of state and local governments. The Programas Estatales de
    Acción ante el Cambio Climático (PEACC, State Program for Climate Change
    Action) are instruments that guide the planning, design and implementation of
    public policies with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation at the
    state level. The first state to prepare its PEACC, with assistance from Institute
    Nacional de Ecologia (INE), was Veracruz in June 2009, followed by the state of
    Nuevo León. Since that time others have followed. Since 2007, technical
    specialists and scientists from most of Mexico‘s 32 states began training for the
    preparation of their PEACC. The first Guía para la Elaboración de Programas
    Estatales de Acción ante el Cambio Climático (Guide for the Preparation of State
    Programs of Action for Climate Change) was prepared by a group comprising
    representatives of the GoM and leading universities in February 2008. This
    Guide was updated in June 2009 to reflect the experience acquired in training and
    supporting states in the development of their respective PEACCs.

13. Progress in the development of municipal plans has been slower, in part because
    of the need to build capacity in this field at the state level first, but it also reflects
    the limits of science. Resolution and reliability of climate impacts declines
    exponentially with the level of spatial disaggregation. Hence there is a need to
    rely upon consensual and no-regrets approaches to address the many unknowns.
    As examples the Bank has assisted with climate change planning in the states of

                                           43
           Michoacan and Campeche using participatory approaches (risk based Strategic
           Environmental Analysis). In both cases stakeholders converged on no-regrets
           options, noting the need for programmatic approaches that leave future options
           open.

      14. To deal with the adaptation challenge confronting cities (such as addressing water
          security, or floods and hazard protection) it is usually necessary to address
          problems far beyond the boundaries of urban areas. For instance flood protection
          typically calls for improved watershed and forest management upstream, likewise
          mitigating hurricane impacts may warrant improved protection of natural defenses
          such as coral reefs or mangroves (to reduce wave or storm velocity and impact)
          tat lie outside the boundaries of cities. Climate proofing a city is thus an activity
          that needs to be addressed at a much wider spatial scale than the legal boundaries
          of a city. Accordingly, urban climate risks are tackled in the state action plans at
          the spatial scale that is most appropriate to the problem at hand (e.g. river basin,
          coastal zone) in the state climate plans.

      15. Knowledge Base: Continue to gather and analyze relevant data to fulfill
          voluntary reporting commitments to the UNFCCC, and to gather, process and
          analyze the costs and impacts of climate change at national and local levels to
          support policy formulation and implementation.

      16. The GoM, supported in part by several international partners, including the Bank,
          has invested heavily in building a strong and extensive knowledge base upon
          which it can develop programs and projects for climate change. Although Mexico
          is not obligated under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions it has
          volunteered to do so. The highlights of the Fourth Communication included: an
          updating of the National GHG Emissions Inventory for 2006, and a description of
          actions taken with respect to mitigation and adaptation and the content and targets
          set in the PECC.

      17. The Bank assisted the GoM in assessing Mexico‘s potential for low carbon
          growth and the macroeconomic and fiscal implication of a low carbon
          development plan. The study, Low-Carbon Development for Mexico (also known
          as MEDEC), presents the results of a two-year effort by a team of Mexican and
          international researchers, under the coordination of the Bank, to identify and
          evaluate high-priority measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions13.

      18. A second major study, The Economics of Climate Change in Mexico, carried out
          with financial support from the GoM, the Government of the United Kingdom
          and the Inter-American Development Bank and technical support from the Bank
          and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean of the

           United Nations, served to inform public policy by assessing the cost of climate
           change in Mexico14. The study follows and builds upon the 2006 Stern Review
           on the Economic of Climate Change. The Mexico Study identified, analyzed and
           quantified the economic costs of climate change for Mexico, and proposed and
           recommended appropriate measures for public policy, both for adaptation and
           mitigation. It is notable in its academic rigor and employs a suite of modeling and
           econometric methods to inform the analysis. The results highlighted that climate
           change has significant impacts on Mexico‘s economy. It concludes that, ―without
           action the Mexican economy will suffer significant economic costs as a
           consequence of climate change. Despite partial short-term gains in some
           activities and regions there are net costs overall and that these costs will increase
           during this century, in particular in the agricultural and water sectors.
           Furthermore, there will be important losses outside the economic sectors and
           market prices, that people value such as biodiversity. Moreover the key
           conclusion is that it is better for the Mexican economy to actively participate in
           an effective international agreement than just face the economic costs of
           adaptation.‖

      19. The GoM also carried out, with Bank technical assistance as well as financing
          from the Government of Japan, a study on the social consequences of climate
          change in Mexico that analyzed the social effects at several levels.15

      20. The analysis and findings of these studies along with other studies carried out by
          the GoM, including Visión de México Sobre REDD+: Hacia una Estrategia
          Nacional and Distribuición de los Costos del Cambio Climático entre los
          Sectores de la Economía Mexicana: Un enfoque de Insumo Producto, have
          already informed public policy, especially the enactment of legislation, the
          allocation of resources, and the design of sectoral programs in urban transport,
          energy, and others sectors, several of which are being supported by the Bank
          assistance (see Annexes 6 and 7). These studies are being used as good practices
          elsewhere.

      21. Institutional Strengthening: Strengthen and provide leadership, accountability
          and training to support the implementation phase of the ENCC.

      22. The Dirección General de Políticas de Cambio Climático delivered its first
          progress report on the progress towards implementation of the PECC. The
          progress report updates information on GHG emissions by sector (energy
          generation, energy consumption, agriculture, livestock and forestry, and solid
          waste) and federal entity (SENER, SAGARPA, SEDESOL, SCT and

   targets, and updates targets for 2011 and 2012 on the basis of progress to date.

23. About 700 officials received training and attended workshops on climate change
    adaptation and mitigation from 2006 to 2011. Training on preparation of
    PEACCs, on climate change adaptation and mitigation of GHG emissions, on
    generation and use of regionalized climate change scenarios, on elaboration of
    GHG inventories, on generation of GHG emission scenarios and on identification
    of adaptation and mitigation measures was delivered to officials of state and
    municipal governments, local academics, organized research groups and NGOs.
    In addition Mexico‘s hosting of COP16 in 2010 also presented a unique
    opportunity for exposing Mexican government and other officials in a high level
    forum where climate change took center stage, over and above the specialized
    training that the GoM was providing.
