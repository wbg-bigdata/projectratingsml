MAGAT RIVER MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT: STAGE II
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested Bank assistance in
financing the second stage of development of the Magat River Multipurpose
Project in Northern Luzon. The first stage of development consists of the
provision of water distribution systems to irrigate a total of 75,000 ha of
rice in the wet season and 29,000 ha in the dry season. The Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) extended a loan in 1973 to assist in the rehabilitation of
40,000 ha of existing irrigation systems under provision of the Angat-Magat
Integrated Agricultural Development Project (AMIADP). The Bank provided
financial assistance for the development of irrigation facilities in the
remaining 35,000 ha of Stage I land in 1975 (Loan 1154-PH). The loan also
provided for engineering studies to review and update the technical and
economic feasibility of implementing the second stage of development of the
Magat river consisting of the provision of reservoir storage for year round
irrigation and for power generation.
1.02      A feasibility study for second stage development of the Magat river
was prepared under the provisions of Loan 1154-PH by the National Irrigation
Administration with assistance of the associated consulting firms Engineering
Consultants Inc. of Denver, Colorado; Shawinigan Engineering Co. Ltd. of
Montreal, Canada; Engineering and Development Corporation of the Philippines
and DCCD Engineering Corporation of Manila. This report is based on that
study and the findings of a Bank appraisal mission which visited the Philippines
in October-November 1977, composed of Messrs. E. G. Giglioli, R. R. Morton
and E. von Loehneysen; Messrs. R. L. P. Harris, V. Talvadkar and J. Cavallotti
also assisted with the report.
The Agricultural Sector
1.03      Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy,
accounting for about one third of net domestic product, over one half of total
employment, and nearly three quarters of export earnings. Over 70% of the
9 million ha of land under cultivation is used for the production of cereals,
of which rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land is taken up
by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples, and tobacco.
1.04      The performance of the agricultural sector will be crucial in deter-
mining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly and equitably.
At present, the domestic market for industrial products is limited by relatively
low rural incomes. Although in recent years there has been a substantial change
in the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, the problems of poverty and income



- 2 -
distribution continue to be particularly acute in rural areas; of the
15 million people in the lowest 40% of the income scale, 12 million
live in rural areas. The Government is aware of these problems and has
initiated a number of programs designed to assist the rural poor.
1.05      A major Government objective is to increase rice and corn produc-
tion as a means of raising the incomes of small farmers and of attaining
national self-sufficiency in food grains. After experiencing substantial
deficits in the early 1970s, rice production grew by 5% p.a. during crop
years 1974-77 and the Philippines was able to provide for consumption solely
from domestic production during the crop years 1975-77. The good performance
in the past three years has been due mainly to an increase in yields brought
about by favorable weather, expansion of the irrigation systems and an
increase in the area planted. With the continued growth of population and
incomes, the demand for rice will rise by 3.5% annually. If rice production
is to increase at a rate sufficient to maintain self-sufficiency on a sustained
basis, further expansion of the irrigated area will be necessary. At present,
only 0.9 million ha, or 28% of the 3.2 million ha devoted to rice production,
are irrigated.
1.06      The Government recognizes that in order to increase production in
both irrigated and nonirrigated areas substantial improvements in the quality
of supporting services will be necessary. In 1973, the Government instituted
a national program for supervised credit for rice production, Masagana 99,
which greatly increased the provision of production credit, mainly to smaller
farmers. However, the levels of arrears under the program have been very high
in the last several years and as a result the coverage of the program has
declined sharply. The Government is aware of this problem and the Technical
Board for Agricultural Credit is undertaking a study of the causes of the
high arrears under Loan 1399-PH which will be discussed with Bank staff in
early 1978 with a view to reaching agreement on the steps necessary to reduce
arrears and maintain the flow of production credit.
1.07      The Government is also considering the steps necessary to bring
about needed improvements in the national extension service. A Bank technical
assistance mission visited the Philippines in April 1977 and a report has been
given to the Government which suggests a number of organizational improvements
and better logistical support in the form of training, vehicles and other
facilities. Missions were in the field in February-March of 1978 to appraise
a national extension project for possible Bank financing and to help the
Government prepare a comprehensive program for strengthening support services
(provision of credit, extension, fertilizer, seeds, and crop protection).
1.08      Since 1969 the Bank Group has financed nine irrigation projects
designed to increase rice production in the country. These projects - three
in Central Luzon, two in the Cagayan Valley of Northern Luzon, one on Mindoro
Island, one in the Visayas and two for smaller systems throughout Northern



Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao /1 - have set the pattern for the type of
irrigation rehabilitation, new construction, and operations needed for
increasing rice production. The projects are providing improved irrigation
and drainage facilities, better road systems for efficiency of operations and
maintenance and for the marketing of farm products, stronger supporting
services to assist farmers in adopting the new irrigation techniques needed
to increase production, and technical assistance and training to help the
National Irrigation Administration (NIA) expand and improve its irrigation
program. These projects would bring about substantial increases in rice
production on about 370,000 ha and would benefit nearly 190,000 farmer
families, most of whom are smallholders.
1.09      Work on the first Bank-assisted project, the Upper Pampanga River
Project (Loan 637-PH) is substantially completed. Progress on all the irriga-
tion projects has been generally satisfactory and the NIA has proved itself
to be a well managed and technically competent organization. The total cost
of the first two projects was about 70% over appraisal estimates in the case
of the Pampanga project (Loan 637-PH) and 55% in the case of the Aurora-
Penaranda Irrigation Project (Loan 984-PH and Credit 472-PH) largely as a
result of rapid inflation following the oil price increase in 1973. However,
as a result of considerable increases in the projected world market price of
rice and earlier than anticipated irrigation benefits the rates of return on
both projects have not changed significantly.
The Power Sector
1.10      The three major regions of the Philippines are in different
stages of power development. Most of past power development has taken place
on the island of Luzon, where about half of the population live and most
industrialization has occurred. Some grid development has also taken place
on the main southern island of Mindanao, particularly in the northern part
where the availability of easily developed low cost hydropower has attracted
substantial industrial investment. In the Visayas, which comprise all other
major islands located in the central part of the Philippine Archipelago,
grids are only now beginning to be constructed.
1.11      Historically, ownership of the power sector has been fragmented.
The largest utility in the country has been the privately-owned Manila Elec-
tric Company (MECO) which holds the franchise for the greater Manila area.
The National Power Corporation (NPC), which is the second largest utility and
/1  The Upper Pampanga River Irrigation Project (Loan 637-PH), Aurora-
Penaranda Irrigation Project (Loan 984-PH, Credit 472-PH), Tarlac Irri-
gation Systems Improvement Project (Loan 1080-PH), Mindoro Rural Develop-
ment Project (Loan 1102-PH), Magat River Multipurpose Project Stage I
(Loan 1154-PH), Chico River Irrigation Project Stage I (Loan 1227-PH),
Jalaur Irrigation Project (Loan 1367-PH), National Irrigation Systems
Improvement Project I (Loan 1414-PH) and National Irrigation Systems
Improvement Project II (Loan 1526-PH).

totally Government-owned, generates and sells power in bulk to other utilities
and large industrial consumers. In addition, there are a number of small
utilities in the country, operating largely in isolation. In 1970, there
were 336 privately-owned and 122 publicly-owned utilities, most of which were
very small and were located in urban areas. Since then a number have been
taken over by rural cooperatives and some have ceased operating. As of
August 1977, about 85 utilities and 73 cooperatives were actually supplying
consumers. Fragmented ownership has made integrated development of the
sector slow and difficult. To overcome the problem, the Government has
taken steps to consolidate ownership of the sector. In 1972 NPC was made
responsible for constructing all future generation facilities and estab-
lishing island grids. The Government is in the process of purchasing most of
MECO's generating plants, which will be operated by NPC in the future. When
this process is completed, MECO will become primarily a power distributor.
The Government has also established the National Electrification Administra-
tion (NEA) with responsibility for integrating small utilities and extending
power service to rural areas. Both NPC and NEA are now responsible to the
Department of Energy.
1.12      The electrification of the country has been progressing steadily.
The per capita consumption of electricity in 1976 was estimated at 300 kWh,
compared with 490 kWh in Korea, 184 kWh in Thailand and 120 kWh in India.
Over 30% of the population is currently served with electricity compared
with 23% in 1970.  Although regional imbalances presently exist, with 46%
of the households electrified in Luzon compared with 15% in Mindanao and
13% in the Visayas, NEA's rural electrification program is expected to
improve the situation. The total electricity supply in 1976 was estimated
at about 13.9 billion kWh; 50% was provided by MECO, 23% by NPC, 20% by self-
generating industries, and 7% by small utilities. On the consumption side,
industrial consumers represented about 55%; residential consumers, 20%; and
commercial, agricultural and other users, 25%.
1.13      The Government is committed to a policy of rapid industrialization
which is central to its objectives of fostering growth, employment and exports.
It is also committed to a policy of dispersing industrial growth from the
already congested Manila Metropolitan Area to other regions of the country.
In order to meet these objectives and to realize the planned annual growth
in Gross National Product of 7% during the next 10 years, it is estimated that
electricity consumption in the Visayas and in Mindanao will need to grow at
annual rates of about 16% and 13%, respectively, compared with about 10% in
Luzon. This would result in an overall annual growth in consumption of 11.3%.
Because NPC is the institution primarily responsible for power generation, it
has a critical role to play in helping the Philippines realize its economic
objectives.
1.14      About 80% of the power generation in the Philippines is currently
dependent on imported oil and the remaining 20% on hydro resources. The
Government has decided to diversify energy resources by developing indigenous
hydro and geothermal power and by introducing nuclear energy. The construc-
tion of the first geothermal power plant is underway in southern Luzon, while
explorations for more geothermal energy are being undertaken in several parts
of the country and have already shown promising results. Investigations

are also progressing at several potential hydropower sites in addition to
Magat. In addition, NPC has also started construction of its first nuclear
power plant with financing from the United States Export-Import Bank and
commercial banks.
1.15      The sector investment program required to meet the expected demand
increase is huge. It will almost triple the country's generating capacity by
expanding it from about 3,540 MW in 1976 to about 8,500 MW in 1985. Emphasis
will be placed on the development of non-oil sources of generation. If imple-
mented as planned, the program would reduce oil-fired generating capacity from
81% of the total in 1974 to 53% in 1985; hydropower would correspondingly
increase from 19 to 31%; and geothermal and nuclear power would share the
remaining 16%. Although the objective of diversifying energy sources is
reasonable, the program is ambitious and involves certain risks. Financial
constraints may hinder the timely development of capital-intensive hydropower
projects and technical problems may arise in developing nuclear and geothermal
sources of energy. The program therefore needs continuous review and, if
difficulties do arise, it is possible that additional oil-fired thermal
plants will be needed.
1.16      The rapid expansion in generating capacity will need to be accom-
panied by a vigorous program of extending the transmission network. In 1976,
NPC had a total of 3,600 km of transmission lines and about 1,200 MVA of
substation capacity to supply utility and non-utility consumers. About
3,300 km of the transmission network are located in Luzon, 200 km in Mindanao
and 100 km in the Visayas. The grid system has been concentrated in the
Central Luzon area, and the population in northern and southern Luzon and
large parts of Mindanao and the Visayas either has no access to electricity
or has to rely on unreliable and costly generation by small local utilities.
NEA is vigorously promoting the rural electrification program throughout the
country. The Bank Group has been assisting the generation and transmission
expansion under the Loans for the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Power projects
(Loan No. 809-PH and Credit No. 296-PH, and Loans No. 1034-PH and 1460-PH),
by financing about 2,460 km of transmission lines and 1,425 MVA of substation
facilities in Luzon. The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan has
provided funds for the first stage of grid expansion in the Cagayan Valley in
northern Luzon. NPC is also expanding the grids in Mindanao and the Visayas
with assistance from the Asian Development Bank and Banque de Paris et des
Pays-Bas.
1.17      Although NPC was originally chartered to develop hydropower re-
sources in the country, its role and responsibilities have been dramatically
expanded in the past few years following the Government's decision to make
it the prime force in the development of power generation from all sources.
This change in policy was so fundamental that NPC has not yet been
able to adjust fully to the new situation. NPC has constructed five hydro-
power stations and one thermal power station in its 40-year history, but it
will need to construct and operate about 75 large power projects in the next
15 years. To carry out a program of the required magnitude successfully,
NPC will need to greatly improve its capacity to construct and operate a much
larger, more modern, and more complex power system. In particular, NPC needs



- 6 -
to improve its capacity for system planning and financial management and
control, to streamline and improve its internal organization, and to develop
effective training programs for its personnel. The Government recognizes the
difficult situation NPC faces and has taken a number of steps to improve its
implementation capability and to enable the staff to cope with the large
development program. An acceptable financial manager has been appointed,
salary scales and merit systems have been improved to make NPC more competi-
tive with private industry and specialized engineers have been recruited from
other government agencies for the newly organized nuclear and geothermal
units.
1.18      Since 1957 the Bank Group has made eight loans and one IDA credit
to NPC, NEA and the Government for eight projects in the power sector./1  Four
projects have been fully completed. The Fifth Power Project included a
second thermal unit at Bataan and transmission facilities in Luzon. Due to
initial delays in the delivery of transformers and poor weather and soil
conditions which affected the implementation of the transmission component,
disbursements are somewhat behind schedule. However, the loan is expected to
be fully disbursed before the closing date which has been postponed from June
30, 1976 to June 30, 1978. The Sixth Power Project includes the construction
of the 100 MW Pantabangan hydropower plant and expansion of transmission
systems in Luzon. The construction of the generating plant was completed in
April 1977 and the plant has since been operating at full capacity. Work on
transmission lines has been slow and completion will be delayed by one year.
The loan for the Seventh Power Project which includes 1,360 km of transmission
lines only became effective in January 1978. While some progress has been
made in the context of past loans to improve NPC's institutional capacity its
responsibilities are expected to grow rapidly in the years ahead and strong
efforts will be necessary to build up NPC's capability further so that it can
effectively implement a much larger power program. The Rural Electrification
Project, which includes a two-year slice of the 1978-80 rural electrification
program, was considered by the Executive Directors in April 1978.
1.19      The project performance audit report on the Fourth Power Project
suggested that the Bank should agree with NPC on procedures for annual review
and revision of tariffs and specific targets for transmission expansion. It
also suggested that the Bank should assist in the development of management
training programs. These comments have been taken into account in the design
of subsequent projects. The report also recommended greater use of local
management consultants to assist NPC. This suggestion was carefully consi-
dered at the time of appraisal of the Seventh Power Project, but in view of
NPC's very rapidly growing responsibilities in the power sector and the
technical requirements of managing a much larger program, it was decided that

the need for technical assistance could only be provided by consultants from
an experienced operating utility of a size equivalent to NPC which has
confronted problems similar to those which will be faced in the power sector
in the Philippines in the coming years. The project provides for training,
management improvement and tariff studies.
1.20      An in-depth analysis of NPC's financial poL ition was conducted
during the appraisal of the Seventh Power Project /1 in early 1976. It was
based on an expansion program which included commissioning of the Tabu and
San Roque hydroelectric dams in 1983, while acknowledging that these would
probably be replaced by Magat. Tabu and San Roque, designed to provide a
total of 340 MW installed capacity and 1,260 GWh energy, were estimated to
cost US$800 million including price contingencies. Magat has an installed
capacity of 360 MW and 1,200 GWh energy at an overall cost of US$495 million.
In comparison, Magat would, therefore, cost NPC considerably less, even if the
total cost of the dam was charged to NPC (para. 4.09). This would mean an
improvement in NPC's financial position as compared to the projections in the
Seventh Power Project appraisal report.
1.21      Under previous Loan Agreements, NPC is required to earn a rate of
return of 8% on its revalued net fixed assets in operation. Failure to
achieve the projected energy sales and higher than expected cost inflation
have combined to prevent NPC from attaining this rate of return; in 1977, NPC
is estimated to have earned a rate of return of approximately 5%; about the
figure forecast during the Seventh Power Project appraisal and accepted by the
Bank for Loan 1460-PH. However, a major tariff increase has now been intro-
duced in Mindanao and further increases in the Visayas and Luzon are under
consideration, which should enable NPC to increase its rate of return in 1978
and thereafter.
Project Formulation
1.22      Cagayan Basin.  The Cagayan river basin in Northern Luzon is
one of the largest of the nine major basins in the Philippines. It covers
some 28,000 sq km and encompasses parts of eight provinces. The Magat
river, lying in the southwestern portion of the basin, is the largest
tributary in the Cagayan basin river system. It is about 150 km long and
joins the Cagayan river in Isabela province. At the site of the proposed dam
the average annual stream flow of the Magat river for the period 1948 to 1972
was 6,698 MCM, ranging from a minimum of 3,931 MCM to a maximum of 12,528 MCM.
1.23      Land is one of the major resources of the basin.  Of the total area
of 2.8 million ha about 1.0 million ha are cultivated, of which 40% is in
Isabela, 30% in Cagayan and the balance equally divided between Nueva Viscaya
and Mountain provinces. The Cagayan basin is an exporter of rice to Manila and
Southern Luzon. The main problem of agriculture is the lack of dependable
water for year round irrigation. Rainfall is usually sufficient to support
wet season cropping but is not only erratic as to time and place of occurence,
but also is deficient in the dry season. In the rainfed areas cropping

is limited to the wet season and the land is unproductive during the dry
months. Even on the irrigation systems in the basin only about 30 to
40% of the land is irrigated during the dry season. A 1966 report on the
land and water resources of the basin, prepared by a survey team of the US
Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), concluded that the Magat subbasin appeared to
have good potential for water resource exploitation and should be given
priority for development.
1.24      Magat River Development.  In 1973 the National Irrigation Adminis-
tration (NIA) with USBR assistance completed a feasibility study of the
Magat river project. The study concluded that development of a multipurpose
project on the river was technically feasible and economically viable. The
project was envisaged to provide storage by building a high dam on the river
to allow year round irrigation of 104,000 ha and installation of a hydro-
electric plant with a 300 MW capacity. Because of the physical size, large
estimated cost and long construction period NIA divided implementation of
the project into two stages. Stage I consists of the rehabilitation and up-
grading of the existing Magat River Irrigation System (MARIS) and Siffu River
Irrigation System (SIFRIS) and construction of new facilities for a total of
75,000 ha that can be served by run of river diversion in the wet season.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting NIA to rehabilitate 40,000 ha
of Stage I under the Angat-Magat Integrated Agricultural Development Project
(AMIADP). The remaining 35,000 ha of Stage I are being developed with Bank
assistance under Loan 1154-PH. The loan became effective in November 1975,
and by the end of 1977 all design work was completed and construction
contracts were awarded for the majority of works. Provision was also made
under the loan for engineering studies (Part A) to evaluate the economic
feasibility of Stage II development and, if justified, to prepare (Part B)
final designs, specifications and bid documents for construction of the dam
and appurtenant works. Part A of the study, completed in September 1976,
confirmed the technical feasibility and economic viability of Stage II
development, which was redefined to include construction of the storage dam
and of additional irrigation facilities to increase the service area to
102,000 ha, together with construction of a power station with an installed
capacity of 360 MW and the provision of generating and transmission equipment.
1.25      Stage II Development.  In view of the large size of the development,
the high cost, the lumpiness of the investment and the tight, 6-1/2 year con-
struction schedule, the Government agreed in 1976 to a breakdown of Stage II
development into the following sequence of manageable packages (Figure 1.1):
(a)  Package I - consisting of preconstruction works (access roads,
permanent camp, etc.), dam foundation grouting, drainage gallery
tunneling and the river diversion tunnels, together with consulting
services associated with these activities. NIA began work on this
Package in 1976 with Government funding and is in the process
of awarding a contract for construction of the tunnels to a
Philippines firm. Implementation is expected to take 3-1/2 years
(1976-79).
(b) Package II - consisting of all civil works for the main dam, and
appurtenant structures, reservoir resettlement, installed mechanical



-9 -
equipment and consulting services. This Package is the subject of
the present report and the proposed Bank loan. Implementation is
expected to take 4-1/2 years (1978-1982).
(c) Package III - consisting of the civil works for the power component,,
together with the supply and installation of penstocks, turbines,
generators, electrical and mechanical equipment and transmission
lines. Foreign funding assistance would be required and implementa-
tion is expected to take four years (1979-82).
(d) Package IV,- consisting of construction of the Baligatan diversion
dam and the civil works for irrigation development of 27,000 ha of
currently rainfed land. Foreign financial assistance would be
sought-and implementation is expected to take four years (1979-82).
2. TIIE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01       The Magat river rises in the Cordillera Central mountains and
joins the Cagayan near Gamu in Isabela province in Northern Luzon. The
watershed and reservoir areas upstream of the proposed dam are in the
relatively mountainous terrain, while the irrigation service area is in
the broad Cagayan valley. The service area, about 350 km northeast of
Manila, is almost entirely in Isabela province, with small portions in
the adjoining Quirino province. The proposed reservoir area would be
mainly in Isabela and Ifugao provinces, with the head of the reservoir
in Nueva Viscaya. (Map No. 13283).
2.02       The Magat dam would be built at a point some 6 km upstream of
the existing MARIS diversion dam near the village of Planas across the gorge
where the river emerges from the foothills into the plains. The service
area is located on alluvial terraces in the flood plains of the Cagayan
and Miagat rivers and tributary streams. It is bounded on the north by
the Mallig river, on the east by the Cagayan river and on the south and
west by the foothills of the Caraballo mountains and the Cordillera Central
respectively. The slope of the land is from west to northeast. The land
is generally level, although some of the older terraces along the western
edge of the service area have eroded significantly and show rolling topo-
graphy. Drainage problems exist because of high rainfall intensities and
flat relief. Low areas along the main rivers are subject to short periods
of inundation from backwaters from overflowing streams, however water velo-
cities are low and cause little damage to structures or land.  Soils are
predominantly dark grey or brown clays or clay loams, with angular blocky
structures, medium to fine textures, slightly acidic reactions and slow
internal drainage. The soils are well suited to rice which has been ex-
tensively grown in the area for many years without problems.
Climate
2.03       The climate in the project area is tropical and monsoonal.
Warm temperatures throughout the year, with minimum change from month-to-
month, allow a 12-month growing season with irrigation. Mean monthly
temperatures in the project service area range from 23.3 degrees centigrade

in January to 29.3 degrees centigrade in May. The hottest months are
April, May and June and the coldest months are December and January. About
75% of the average annual rainfall of 1,900 mm falls in the six-month period
of July through December with the heaviest precipitation in November and
the least rainfall in February. However, in the catchment area of the
proposed dam some 77% of the average annual rainfall of about 2,140 mm occurs
from May through October. The occurrence of typhoons is also centered
within the July-December period with the highest frequency of occurrence
in September. An average of about three typhoons per year have passed
through the Cagayan basin since 1948.  No typhoon has been recorded for the
months January through March. The rainfall, together with river flows in the
wet season, is generally adequate for a single rice crop. Dry-season cropping,
however, entails considerably more risk and irrigation is essential for an
assured crop.
Hydrology
2.04      The drainage area of the Magat river basin at the proposed damsite
is 4,143 sq km. Rainfall and stream flow records in the drainage area and
adjoining catchments are extensive and the hydrologic data derived are of
high quality. Monthly streamflow records were made for the 25 year period
from 1948 to 1972 and average monthly flows ranged from about 240 MCM in
February and March to about 970 MCM in September and October. The minimum
recorded monthly flow was 37.4 MCM in March 1967, and the maximum 2,785.2 MCM
in October 1971. Annual totals varied from a minimum of 3,931 MCM in 1959 to
a maximum of 12,528 MCM in 1971, with an average of 6,698 MCM. Peak flood
flows ranged from 1,700 cu m/sec for the period January through March,
4,050 cu m/sec in April, 6,080 cu m/sec for May through August, to an esti-
mated 20,000 cu m/sec in October 1971.  A peak discharge of 3,900 cu m/sec
has a 50% chance of occurring in any year. A maximum probable peak inflow of
34,543 cu m/sec has been used for spillway and dam safety design purposes
(para 3.13).
Sedimentation
2.05      The watershed terrain above the proposed Magat dam site is mostly
rugged grassland with scattered forests at higher elevations. The potential
for erosion in the watershed is great due to the steep slopes and high
rainfalls. However, the ground and canopy cover is adequate and current
sediment yields are moderate. A sediment discharge rating curve for the
river was derived from measurements of suspended sediment load at various
locations and from computations of the bed load and the bed material load in
suspension. It is estimated that sand and gravel comprise 51% of the average
annual sediment load upstream of the damsite, while 37% is silt and 12%
clay. The computed sediment load between 1971 and 1976 averaged 8.5 million
ton/year and the projected rate of sedimentation in the reservoir is an
estimated 5.5 million cu meters/year. Most of the sediment deposition would
occur at elevations below the minimum supply level, although live storage in
the proposed reservoir would decrease from 933 MCM to 832 MCM over a 50 year
period. The sediment level at the face of the dam is not expected to reach
the invert of the outlet works for at least 100 years. These projections
assume no increase in erosion in the watershed and, while there is evidence
of deteriorating conditions caused by man and by severe typhoons, the Govern-
ment with Bank assistance is carrying out erosion control studies to ensure



- 12 -
controlled watershed management practices in the future. These could result
in a decrease in sedimentation and larger annual water yields than assumed in
the projects' reservoir operation studies (para. 3.10).
Geology
2.06      The geology of the Philippines is dominated by the Philippine Rift,
a regional fault zone that cuts northwestwards through the archipelago from
the southeast corner of Mindanao to the northwest corner of Luzon. This
structure is a major branch of the deep-seated crustal fault system that
separates the western edge of the Pacific Plate from the Austral-Asian
Plates. The fault system is the principal focus for major earthquakes in the
area.  Midway across Luzon a major fault system branches from the Rift and
splits into a number of regional faults that encompass the mountain ranges of
Northern Luzon. The Cagayan basin is bounded by two of these uplifted
mountain blocks, the Cordillera Central range to the west and the Sierra
Madre range to the east. As the mountain blocks were formed in different
geological ages and have different rock compositions, the project area is
underlain by a complex array of metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks.
The proposed dam site is located at the transition zone of these rock for-
mations close to faults which form the eastern edge of the Cordillera range
and is consequently affected by major geologic structural action. The
bedrock at the site is composed predominantly of massive volcanic tuffs and
agglomerates intercalated with basalt flows. The foundation characteristics
of the unweathered portion of this sequence of volcanic rocks range from good
to excellent. The principal exceptions occur where the rocks are cut by
faults, two of which have been identified near the proposed project structures.
The significant fault, designated the Magat fault, was largely covered by
weathered rocks and soils and was only discovered after extensive site
exploration exposed bedrock. It is located about 500 m downstream of the
proposed dam, where it crosses the river parallel to the dam axis and has a
total width ranging from 150 to 200 m. Its shear zones consist of intensely
sheared and brecciated rocks and vary in thickness from 20 cm to 40 m. Two
other major faults have been identified downstream of the proposed dam site,
the significant one being the Santiago fault which runs northward along the
eastern side of the Cordillera range about 10 km from the site and along
which seismic action is believed to occur. The Magat fault is probably a
member of this fault system.
Seismicity
2.07       The international file of seismic events for Northern Luzon
(January 1976) shows that in the past 79 years at least 146 seismic events
larger than Richter Magnitude 5 have occurred within 320 km of Magat dam,
although the actual number is probably greater because of inadequate report-
ing and loss of data. Most of the events were in the ocean immediately
offshore of the Pacific coastal areas of Northern Luzon, however some 30
appear to have had a location along an inferred northerly extension of the
Santiago fault. The Magat fault also gives evidence of ground displacement
due to seismic activity. While these earthquakes have undoubtedly transmitted
ground motions to the dam site, no evidence of very recent seismic movement
has been observed along any of the major geological structures identified at
the site. The faults at the dam site are assessed to be more than 100,000
years old and recurrence of movement is thought to be unlikely.

Irrigation Facilities
2.08       About 50,000 ha of land in the project area fall within the ex-
isting MARIS and SIFRIS systems operated by NIA. The two national systems
were completed in the 1960s. Although designed to serve an area of 50,000 ha,
the two systems only irrigate 40,000 ha because of a lack of terminal facili-
ties. The existing systems are being rehabilitated, upgraded and expanded to
a total of 75,000 ha under Stage I of the Magat project with ADB and Bank
assistance. Construction work on Stage I is expected to be completed by
1980, except for modifications of the MARIS diversion dam which will be
finished in June 1982 to fit in with the closure of the proposed Magat dam.
2.09       The final phase of irrigation development in the Magat service
area would amount to some 27,000 ha and would be dependent on construction
of the Magat dam. About half of the area would be along the southeastern
edge of the Stage I area and would obtain water from the proposed Magat
reservoir through Baligatan creek, without passing through the power station
turbines. Only about 5,700 ha of land are currently served by crude comm-
unal and private irrigation facilities, while the remainder is cultivated
under rainfed conditions.
Population, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.10       Total population in the 102,000 ha service area of the proposed
dam is estimated at about 282,000 people. The rural population of the Stage I
project area consists of about 24,000 farm families and some 9,000 other
families occupied principally or entirely in agricultural production, while
in the Stage II area there are 8,000 farm families and about 4,400 other rural
families. The average size of farm in the service area is 3.2 ha and there
is little divergence from the mean in the more densely populated and
better developed Stage I area. In the more backward and largely rainfed
Stage II area, farm size distribution is more skewed, with 10% of the farms
covering 35% of the area. After completion of the land transfer process
initiated under the Government's program of agrarian reform some 21,500
owner operators, the equivalent of 67% of the farmers, would cultivate
74,000 ha or 73% of the project area. The remaining 10,500 farmers would
be leaseholders.
Reservoir Area
2.11      The proposed dam would create a reservoir with a surface area of
45 sq km at full supply level of 193 m. At minimum supply level the water
surface elevation would be 160 m and the surface area 15 sq km. The reservoir
would be situated along a 30 km stretch of the Magat river where it passes
through hilly terrain. Most of the area flooded would be restricted to
relatively narrow river bottoms. However, the downstream section of the
reservoir would flood to a width of about 4 km. The reservoir would be of
this shape when full or nearly so, a condition which would exist for about
60% of the time.
2.12      Present land use in the area that would be affected by the reservoir
is as follows:



- 14 -
Ranches            1,965 ha
Rice land          1,335 "
Corn land             75 "
Fishponds              5 "
Residential           70 "
Total           3,450 "
The remaining 1,050 ha in the reservoir area are taken up by rivers, creeks
and scattered patches of cogon grassland. The dam would submerge seven
small barrios in Ifugao province, one small barrio in Nueva Viscaya province
and two barrios in Isabela province, one of which would be the relatively
large barrio of Planas. A total of 300 families, or 1,500 people, would be
affected by the reservoir and would need to be resettled under the project
(para. 3.19).
Transportation
2.13      The Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway connecting Manila with the
port of Aparri on the Babuyan channel, passes through Santiago and the
southeastern part of the project area. The highway is concrete surfaced,
but is susceptible to damage from washouts and landslides due to heavy
rainfall during typhoons. The 20 km gravel surfaced road between Santiago
and the MARIS diversion dam is in poor condition and would require upgrading
and sustained maintenance to permit unimpeded construction of the Magat dam.
NIA has built an all-weather, gravel road up the right side of the Magat
river from the MARIS diversion dam for a distance of 10 km to the proposed
dam site. The service area is well provided with national, provincial and
local access roads. The network of local access and service roads is being
upgraded and expanded by NIA under Stage I of the project, while three
provincial roads are being improved under the Chico River Irrigation Project
(Loan 1227-PH). Daily commercial air service to Manila is available at the
Cauayan airport about 35 km northeast of the dam site. In addition NIA has
built an airstrip with a 1,200 m long paved runway adjacent to the MARIS
diversion dam.
Transmission Facilities
2.14      The National Power Corporation's (NPC) development plans for
extension of the Central Luzon grid call for the construction of a double
circuit 230 kV transmission line from Ambuklao to Santiago, and a single
circuit 230 kV line from Santiago to Tuguegarao. At present NPC is construct-
ing a double circuit 230 kV line with only one circuit strung between Ambuklao,
Santiago and Tuguegarao, due for completion in 1979 with assistance from the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. The second circuit between
Santiago and Ambuklao would be strung simultaneously with installation of the
four generating units in the proposed Magat power station. By 1982 there
would be two 230 kV circuits from Santiago via Ambuklao and Binga to San
Manuel from which point south there would be three circuits. This transmission
represents the system into which Magat would be feeding and over which Magat
energy would be delivered to load areas primarily to the south. The other
addition required by the Magat plant would be a 14 km 230 kV double circuit
transmission line from Magat to Santiago plus the switchyard facilities at
both stations (Map No. 3562R4).

3. THE PROJECT
3.01      The project proposed for Bank financing (Package II) would include:
(a) construction of the main dam across the Magat river consisting of
a concrete spillway, a power intake section and adjoining rockfill
embankment sections;
(b)  construction of the rockfill Baligatan dike running from the right
abutment of the main dam to the left abutment of the Baligatan
creek dam;
(c)  construction of the rockfill Baligatan creek dam, together with an
outlet conduit and control works;
(d) resettlement within the service area of the dam of about 500 families
affected by construction of the dam; and
(e) provision of consulting services to assist NIA and NPC in design and
construction supervision.
3.02      The Magat dam and Baligatan dike would provide 933 MCM of live
reservoir storage for downstream year round irrigation of 89,700 ha of land
via the existing MIARIS diversion dam and for power generation. The Baligatan
creek dam would control additional water releases from the reservoir for year
round irrigation of 12,300 ha of currently rainfed land via the planned
Baligatan diversion dam.
Project Works
3.03      Main Dam and Spillway.  The main dam would be 1,800 m long, made up
of a concrete chute spillway and power intake section 450 m long, a left
abutment rockfill embankment section 350 m long and a river closure and right
abutment rockfill embankment section 1,000 m long. Mtaximum height of the
spillway section would be 60 m and of the embankment section 114 m. Design
of the main dam has evolved after two years of intensive site investigations
and takes full account of the usual problems inherent in large dam construc-
tion, as well as the particularly complex problems of geology, seismicity and
hydrology found in north-eastern Luzon. Conservative design criteria have
been adopted for the embankment sections, with heavy outer shells of random
fill and rock surrounding a sloping impervious core. The proposed slope of
the upstream face would be 2.65:1 and 2.0:1 for the downstream face. About
25% of the 12 million cubic meters of embankment materials is expected to
come from required excavation and the balance from a quarry on the left bank
of the river, borrow pits and the river bed. The proposed zoning of the fill
is relatively complex, but it is designed to provide a structure capable of
withstanding heavy seismic shaking and minor displacements. It also provides
for optimum utilization of materials from excavation and from readily avail-
able borrow areas.



- 16 -
3.04      The spillway and power intake structure would be a concrete-gravity
section situated on the left bank of the river. The location was determined
by site geology and economic consideration of alternative dam designs. The
spillway would have seven 16.5 m wide and 13.5 m high radial crest gates for
flood water discharge and two 6.0 m wide and 12.5 m high low level orifice
gates for irrigation or emergency draw-down water releases. Spillway discharge
would be into a 450 m long reinforced concrete open chute with terminal
flip-buckets and plunge pool. Detailed hydraulic model and simulation
studies of the spillway outlet structures are in progress to ensure optimum
energy dissipation. Recent experiences at the Tarbela dam in Pakistan are
being given full consideration in development of the design.
3.05      The power intake structure would provide six gated conduits to
connect with 5.5 m diameter steel penstocks to be constructed as part of the
proposed power development. Trashracks, closure gates 5.0 m high and 6.0 m
wide, and two emergency bulkhead gates would be installed. Only over-burden
excavation for the penstock and powerhouse foundations would be included in
the dam contract. As the interface between the concrete intake structure and
the right embankment dam is over 60 m high, the possibilities of embankment
cracking and hydraulic fracturing of the fill at the interface have been
recognized and an appropriate embankment "wrap-around" concrete design
developed. The lower interface between the spillway and the left abutment
embankment would be constructed similarly.
3.06      Baligatan Dike and Baligatan Creek Dam.  The Baligatan dike would
be 1,450 m long and would have a maximum height of 35 m, but would only be
about 20 m high for most of its length, with a volume of fill of about
1.9 million cu m. Construction of the dike would utilize material from
required excavations in the external shells and transition zones. As the
shell materials would not have as high a strength as the river gravels or
rock fill to be used in the two dams, the slopes would be flattened to 2.75:1
on the upstream side and 2.50:1 on the downstream side. The Baligatan creek
dam would be 700 m long with a maximum height of 50 m and a volume of fill
of about 1.1 million cu m. The dam would have a slope of 2.65:1 on the
upstream side and 2.0:1 on the downstream side, the same section as the main
dam.
Engineering and Construction
3.07      Engineering Studies.  The 1973 NIA/USBR Feasibility Study (para. 1.23)
proposed a composite concrete/rockfill dam with a central gated overflow
spillway. This concept was the starting point for detailed studies carried
out under Stage I of the project with Bank assistance (Loan 1154-PH).  Part A
of these studies covered engineering and economic investigations to confirm
the technical feasibility of the project and assess its economic justification.
The consultants engaged by NIA for the studies commenced work in late 1975
and completed a Project Design Report (PDR) in September 1976.
3.08      The consultants reviewed and modified the 1973 design report
proposals in the light of additional site investigations and studied alterna-
tive design concepts. Two layouts, the original composite dam proposal
and the embankment dam now proposed, were identified for detailed study of



- 17 -
technical quality, implementation time and construction cost. The Baligatan
dike and Baligatan creek dam and outlet works, would be common to both
schemes, the required volumes of concrete and fill and the length of construc-
tion time would constitute the main differences. While the composite scheme
with a concrete gravity spillway centrally located in the river valley would
have hydraulic advantages over the proposed embankment scheme with a chute
spillway, the latter was selected for the following considerations:
(a) the base (June 1978) cost of the embankment scheme is estimated
to be US$38 million less than the cost of the composite scheme;
(b) an accelerated construction schedule would be practical for the
embankment scheme, leading to completion by December 1982 instead
of late 1984 as envisaged at Stage I appraisal;
(c) the composite scheme would require at least two years longer to
design and construct, resulting in a delay in project benefits;
(d) foundation conditions favor an embankment scheme in view of possible
regional seismic activity; the composite design would require 90 m
high interfaces between concrete and fill which would be very
suscepible to any ground movement; and
(e) the composite scheme, with a concrete gravity section 650 m long and
a maxium height of 114 m, would need an additional 2 million cu m of
concrete and potential constraints in cement delivery to site would
be a major risk factor in construction scheduling.
3.09      Project Design.  Following completion of Part A of the studies, NIA
with Bank approval authorized the consultants to proceed with Part B, the
finalization of designs and preparation of contract documents. NIA also
appointed a specialist international Board of Consultants (NBC) to assist in
review and approval of consultants' designs. The designs now proposed for
construction are therefore based on very extensive and detailed engineering
planning and analysis, reviewed and approved by a panel of specialist consult-
ants. The key factors governing the adopted project design features were:
reservoir operation studies, site geology and seismology, design flood and
river diversion during construction.
3.10      Reservoir Operation Studies.  Reservoir operation studies were per-
formed to determine (i) the optimum size of the reservoir, power plant, and
irrigation area to be served, (ii) the extent of irrigation water shortages
and (iii) power and energy generation. Simulated reservoir operations for a
15-year period were performed for over 20 different combinations of reservoir
sizes, irrigation areas, and power plant capacities. The results of these
studies, which balanced projected irrigation and power benefits against
projected costs, indicated that (i) reservoir size up to a full supply level
of 193 m would be justified, (ii) installation of four 90 MW generating units
would be justified initially, with provision of space for possible later
installation of two additional 90 MW units a matter of long range policy,
(iii) development of an additional irrigation area up to 27,000 ha would be



- 18 -
justified, (iv) irrigation water shortages once every five years on average
could be expected, but would be nominal and overall would be in the range of
3% only. The installation of 360 MW generating capacity would result in an
average annual energy production of 1,200 GWh and provide additional firm
capacity for the Luzon grid varying between 172 and 360 MW. An assurance was
obtained that the Government would satisfy the Bank of the economic and
technical justification of any increase in installed generating capacity
above 360 MW. The optimum reservoir operation simulation was based on the
following design parameters:
(a) reservoir full supply level at elevation 193 m;
(b) reservoir minimum supply level at elevation 160 m;
(c)  effective live storage of 832 MCM, allowing for 50 years of
sedimentation;
(d)  irrigation diversion requirements for a total area of 102,000 ha;
(e) an installed generating capacity of 360 MW rated at full supply
level with a net head of 87 m;
(f) a minimum capacity of 172 MW at minimum supply level with a net
head of 54 m;
(g) a priority rule that when irrigation water shortages occur they
are first allocated to the Baligatan diversion dam since these
releases do not produce energy generation; and
(h) a reservoir rule curve with controlled releases to hold the
reservoir at or below elevation 185 m in June and July and eleva-
tion 190 m in August and September.
On these assumptions annual average water use would be as follows:
Percentage of
Volume (MCM)   Annual Inflow
Evaporation loss                               37              0.5
Reservoir spill                               415              5.9
Irrigation only (Baligatan)                   285              4.1
Irrigation and power (Magat)                1,682             24.1
Power only                                  4,562             65.4
Total                                 6,981             100.0
3.11      Geology and Seismicity.  The complex geological and seismic char-
acteristics of the area (para. 2.06 and 2.07) necessitated unusually exten-
sive site exploration. Over 3,800 ha of geological mapping, 18,300 m of
exploratory drilling, 13,400 m of excavated surface trenches and 360 m of
exploratory tunneling were carried out. Findings have been under continuous



- 19 -
review by the project consultants supported by specialists in the fields of
geology, geotechnology and seismology. The foundation rock at the site is
relatively weak with the numerous shear zones and faults and deep weathering
responsible for large variations in its bearing capacity. Exposure of the
major Magat fault during site exploration (para. 2.05) and extensive study of
its implications by the project consultants and the NBC led to revision of
the layout of dam structures adopted on completion of Part A of the consultants'
studies. The original layout located the diversion tunnels, the spillway and
the powerhouse on the right bank of the river. The spillway crest section
was founded on excellent agglomerate bedrock, but the proposed spillway chute
would have crossed the Magat fault zone for a distance of 200 to 500 m
downstream of the crest. While the in situ rock within the fault zone was
found to have enough bearing strength to provide an acceptable foundation for
the spillway, the NBC recommended development of alternative layouts because
of the possibility of seismic related movement in the intensely sheared rock
and because of the negligible resistance of the material to erosion by
surface water. Consideration was given to either shortening the spillway
chute or lengthening it to bridge the fault zone, however both layouts
significantly increased the probability of major erosion at the spillway plunge
pool. The NBC recommended relocation of the spillway. Intensive additional
exploration was carried out on the left bank of the river and rock conditions
were found to be generally favorable. A thrust fault, named the Korokan
fault, was exposed but the NBC considered it to be much less significant than
the Magat fault and stated that present day earthquake induced displacement
was not a probability. However, as a precaution, as few concrete structures
as possible would be founded on the trace of the Korokan fault. As a result
of the additional geological information the axis of the main dam was re-
aligned and the spillway and powerhouse were relocated on the left bank of
the river. The proposed project layout takes full account of the extensive
data now available. The concrete structures, the powerhouse and the outfall
of the chute spillway would be sited clear of all major shear zones and
faults, the spillway plunge pool being located in sound rock just upstream of
the Magat fault. Provision has been made in the bid documents and cost
estimates for concrete lining of the plunge pool (Figures 3.1 and 3.2).
3.12      Design parameters for the dam take full account of potential loads
due to seismic activity and possible small ground movement. Parameters are
based on estimates of the effects of earthquake occurrence along a nearby
(10 km) relatively small active fault (6.0 on Richter scale) and along a
major, but more distant (40 km) active fault (8.0 on Richter scale). The
latter is the controlling design earthquake and a maximum ground acceleration
of 0.4 g has been adopted for basic design. Final designs will be checked by
sophisticated dynamic loading analyses techniques. Instrumentation is being
installed in the vicinity of the site for long-term study of seismic activity
and correlation with data from the normal large dam instrumentation that
would be installed during construction.
3.13      Design Floods.  A high standard of safety has been adopted in
selecting design flood values. Detailed analyses of streamflow and rainfall
data from the Cagayan and adjoining basins were made and regional and river
peak discharge, frequency and drainage area relationships derived. The
average annual peak discharge at the dam site is 4,500 cu m/sec. Peak flood



- 20 -
discharges for 100-year, 1,000-year, 10,000-year frequencies are about
13,900, 21,500 and 30,600 cu m/sec respectively. The reservoir inflow design
flood hydrograph was derived by estimating maximum storm rainfall over the
Magat watershed and basin lag time. Design storm values were based on
maximum point rainfall records at Baguio, located close to the Magat basin
and having the highest recorded rainfall in the Philippines. An inflow
design peak flow of 34,453 cu m/sec and a ten day volume of 8,420 MCM was
used in flood routing for the proposed spillway configuration.
3.14      Proposed full supply level (FSL) for the reservoir is elevation
193 m with the spillway crest elevation 174 m. Design flood routing assumed
a full reservoir when flood inflow commences with subsequent gate openings
maintaining the FSL until all gates are fully raised. Spillway discharge at
this stage would be about 22,000 cu m/sec. As flood inflow continues with
uncontrolled spillway discharge the maximum reservoir level would reach
elevation 196.3 m with a peak spillway discharge of about 31,000 cu m/sec.
Proposed dam crest level is elevation 199 m to allow freeboard for wave
action. Hydraulic model studies for the proposed spillway chute are in
progress to assist in design of the chute and flip buckets for flood dis-
charges.
3.15      River Diversion During Construction.  Due to the magnitude of
floods and the restricted space in the valley at the proposed damsite,
diversion of the Magat river during dam construction has a significant
influence on design layout and construction scheduling. The 25-year return
period seasonal flows used in developing the diversion scheme are 9,500
cu m/sec annual, 6,120 cu m/sec May through August, and 1,750 cu m/sec
January through April. With adoption of an embankment dam, provision of diver-
sions tunnels around the dam site is essential. However, conventional tunnels
of the capacity required for full river control would not be economically
practical and construction planning has been based on use of two 12 m diameter
concrete lined tunnels with a maximum discharge capacity of 5,400 cu m/sec
plus cofferdam overspill in the early stages of construction. To allow for
this, excavation of riverbed to foundation rock and replacement by concrete
is scheduled following completion of tunnels and cofferdams. Subsequent
wet-season overspill would be carried by the excavated spillway channel and
by the spillway structure during construction. To minimize erosion damage
cofferdam protection would include heavy riprap on the crest and armoring of
the downstream toe. The proposed diversion scheme will require precise
scheduling of excavation, cofferdam and embankment fill and concrete placement
together with availability of the diversion tunnels on schedule, necessitating
a high level of contracting capability and construction supervision.
3.16      Construction Schedule.  NIA has an ongoing program of force account
foundation grouting along the alignment of the Baligatan dike and is currently
finalizing negotiations with a contractor for construction of the diversion
tunnels. These works are included in the ongoing Package I of the Magat deve-
lopment being financed entirely from Government sources (para. 1.24). NIA
proposes to award the Magat dam contract by June 15, 1978 (para. 3.25). Con-
struction of the main dam, Baligatan dike and Baligatan creek dam would form



- 21 -
part of a single contract. The contractor would also be responsible for
installation of the spillway, power intake and Baligatan creek gates which
would be supplied under a separately financed contract (para. 3.23).
3.17      Construction of the dam is scheduled over four construction seasons
with completion by December 1982. The staging of construction to safely pass
the large wet season river flows and timely completion of the diversion
tunnels would be critical factors in meeting the planned timetable. Availa-
bility of materials on the site, particularly cement, will be of paramount
importance. The average concrete placement over a 32 month period between
May 1979 and December 1981 is estimated at 31,000 cu meters per month, with a
peak rate of 1,500 cu meters per day. The average daily cement requirement
would be about 250 tons with a peak demand of 350 tons. There are no cement
factories in the Cagayan valley and all cement would have to be delivered to
site from Central Luzon factories by road haulage over the Philippine - Japan
Friendship Highway. This would impose a considerable risk factor in view of
the susceptibility of the highway to damage during heavy rainfall (para.
2.13). To minimize the risk the dam contractor would be required to ensure
provision of cement storage facilities near the site. A storage capacity of
10,000 tons would be needed. The excavation and embankment fill requirements
would also be demanding, with a peak material movement of 900,000 cu meters
per month. The planned construction schedule is shown in Figure 3.1 and
detailed construction quantities are given in Annex 1.
Reservoir Resettlement
3.18      NIA has created within the Magat River Multipurpose Project (MRMP)
organization a Resettlement and Reservoir Division (RRD) with responsibility
for resettling the families affected by the reservoir in three resettlement
sites. The San Marcos site is situated in the Stage I service area and the
San Miguel and San Antonio sites are in the proposed Stage II area. All
resettlement sites would be provided with year round irrigation. NIA would
purchase the land and provide each family from the reservoir area with a 3 ha
farm plot, the limit for irrigated holdings under agrarian reform legislation,
together with a 600 sq m house plot in a newly established barrio site. As
the total buy-out of owner-operators and the ejection of tenant farmers on
rice and corn lands is forbidden, some 200 existing owner operators and
tenant farmers in the resettlement areas would also be provided with a 3 ha
farm plot and a house plot. NIA would pay compensation for land, houses,
fruit and shade trees and all improvements to land submerged by the dam.
3.19      Some 500 families, 300 from the reservoir and 200 from the resettle-
ment area, would be involved in the program. Each family would be provided
with an NIA-built house and each of the three new barrio sites would have
water, electricity, a school, church and community center built as part of
the project. The resettled families would have to repay for their new homes
and land in 15 equal annual installments at an interest rate of 6% per annum,
in the same way as land reform beneficiaries. Provision would be made under
the project for financial assistance to the resettled families in the way of
crop production inputs and subsistence until they have harvested the first



- 22 -
crop in their new areas. A Resettlement Committee has been established,
consisting of all concerned central and provincial government agencies, the
mayors of the affected municipalities and the barrio captains from the reservoir
area communities. The Committee is responsible for reviewing all plans and
proposals for the reservoir area to ensure that resettlement takes place
smoothly and with the minimum amount of dislocation. An assurance was
obtained that NIA would keep the Bank informed of the arrangements to be made
for resettlement of the affected population and that the Bank would have an
opportunity to comment before they were implemented.
Cost Estimates
3.20      The total project cost is estimated at US$346.0 million, of which
US$178.0 million or 51% is foreign exchange. The direct foreign exchange
requirement is estimated at US$146.0 million and the indirect foreign exchange
at US$30.0 million. Construction costs are based on a detailed contractor-
type estimate assuming a bid from a joint venture company consisting of one
local and one foreign contracting firm. Unit prices are based on equipment
use (purchase, operation and depreciation), labor, materials and contractors'
overhead and profit in accordance with the anticipated construction schedule.
Prices include about 6% for taxes and are based on costs for similar works in
the Philippines in January 1977, and suppliers estimates for materials and
equipment in April 1977. NIA's costs for construction supervision and
administration are included under engineering./I The base cost estimate is
expressed in June 1978 prices, and was obtained by increasing January 1977
civil works estimates by 14% and April 1977 equipment estimates by 9% to
allow for inflation. A physical contingency factor based on the degree of
investigations completed to date was applied. A factor of 7% was used for
the spillway gates and 9% for civil works and reservoir clearing and resettle-
ment. Costs due to expected price increases over the implementation period
amount to about 16% of base cost plus physical contingencies and assume the
following annual rates of price inflation for local and foreign costs:
Annual Inflation Rate (%)
1978     1979     1980-82
Civil works and services        8         7.5        7
Equipment                       7         6.5        6
3.21      Details of project cost estimates are presented in Table 3.1 and
summarized below, while the overall estimated costs of Stage II development
of the MRIT  are given in Table 3.2.
/1  Up to January 1978, NIA was exempt from the payment of duty on equipment,
whether imported for its own use or on behalf of a contractor. The
Department of Finance has terminated NIA's exemption and instructed the
agency to make budgetary provisions for duties. The mechanics of imple-
mentation are not clear and are currently under discussion, as the
Government is the sole source of NIA's funds. In view of the uncer-
tainty, the estimated duties on equipment of about US$4.0 million have
not been included in the project costs.

Force account work on Package I, consisting of foundation grouting and
tunneling of a drainage gallery along the damsite axis, has already started
and NIA has awarded a US$27.0 million contract for the river diversion
tunnels (para. 3.16). The works in Package I are an essential prerequisite
for construction of the Magat dam under the project proposed for Bank assis-
tance. Construction of the dam would not be justified unless the power and
irrigation phases of the development are implemented in a timely manner so as
to be ready for operation by January 1, 1983, assurances to this effect were
obtained from the Government. The National Power Corporation (NPC) would
undertake the construction of the power component (Package III) by calling
for international bids on a turnkey basis. The Government has already
received a number of offers of financial assistance for the power component.
NPC proposes to call for bids for the component by mid-1978 and to proceed
with award of the contract by the end of the year. Assurances were obtained
that any contractual and financial arrangements proposed to the Government
and/or NPC for the power component would be subject to review by the Bank
prior to conclusion of such agreements.
3.23      The proposed Bank loan for Package II of US$150 million would
finance 84% of the foreign exchange cost of the project and would cover
43% of total project costs. The Government would provide the remaining
P 1,450 million (US$196.0 million) from annual budget appropriations. Of
this amount about P 207.2 million (US$28.0 million) is foreign exchange. NIA
intends to procure the supply of the spillway, power intake and Baligatan
creek gates (US$16.0 million) by supplier financing. With assistance of the
consultants, NIA has prequalified potential suppliers and expects to call for
bids for the supply of the gates by the middle of 1978 and to proceed with
award of the contract by the end of the year. While the provision of the
gates would not be included in the Bank financed project, they are essential
for the functioning of the dam and assurances were obtained that NIA would
make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with a qualified supplier for
their timely provision. To ensure a timely and continuous flow of funds,
assurances were obtained that the Government would cause NIA to set up a
special fund to service the project which would be replenished by the
Government at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated
requirement for the next two months. Establishment of the fund would be a
condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Procurement
3.24      Materials testing equipment and vehicles, costing about US$0.4 mil-
lion, would be procured after international bidding in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of
imported goods, or the custom duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to
local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Local shopping is appropriate
for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$10,000 each because the advan-
tages of international competitive bidding would be clearly outweighed by the
administrative costs involved. The total cost of such items would not exceed
US$300,000. Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures and they are
acceptable. There is adequate competition and foreign firms can participate.
A list of equipment requirements is given in Annex 1.

3.25      Civil works on the Magat dam and appurtenant structures (US$229.0 mil-
lion) were widely advertised internationally and prequalification of prospective
bidders has been completed according to Bank Group Guidelines. Prequalifi-
cation forms were issued in June 1977 to 47 interested companies and joint
ventures (24 foreign and 23 local) and submissions were received in September
1977 from 16 firms. Following technical and financial evaluation, nine
companies were prequalified. Bidding documents were issued to the nine
prospective bidders in January 1978 and bids are due on April 27, 1978. Work
associated with clearing of the reservoir and resettlement of the affected
population (US$2.4 million) would be carried out mainly by local contractors.
Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures for competitive bidding and
they are acceptable. There is potentially adequate competition and foreign
firms can participate.
Disbursements
3.26      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment, and 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and 65% for imported equipment
procured locally. Disbursements for civil works would be 40% of certified
monthly progress payments or expenditures. Disbursement for force account
works would be made against certificates of expenditure, the documentation
for which would not be submitted to the Bank for review, but would be retained
by the borrower and made available for inspection by the Bank's supervision
missions. For civil works contractors' mobilization and equipment, disburse-
ments would be at the rate of 100% of foreign exchan&e cqp)t.

3.27      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against import documentation,
contracts and certified records of payment or expenditure. It is expected
that disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1983, approximately one
year after the end of construction. In consultation with the Bank, savings
under the project would be used to cover remaining foreign exchange costs of
the project. An estimated schedule of expenditures, a semi-annual disburse-
ment schedule and a proposed allocation of loan proceeds are given in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audit
3.28      The NIA is a Government agency and its accounts are audited
annually by the Governments' Commission on Audit. Assurances were obtained
that NIA would maintain separate accounts for the project and that after
audit by the Commission on Audit, the project accounts, together with the
auditor's comments and opinion on the certification of expenditure for force
account work, would be sent to the Bank within six months of the close of
each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.29      Construction of the dam would have a significant impact on the
downstream hydrology of the river. The short (6 km) stretch down to the
MARIS diversion dam would become a reregulating reservoir with wide surface



-28 -
fluctuations. Flows below the diversion dam would be noticeably altered,
particularly during the dry season, because of irrigation abstractions. As
the reservoir is lowered every year the shoreline is expected to shift
laterally by as much as 3 km in the vicinity of Planas. Such widely fluctuat-
ing reservoir levels would preclude the development of vegetation below the
full supply level and would lead to the creation of mud flats. As the river
enters the reservoir there would be a decrease in the flow velocity, followed
by deposition of the larger particles of sediment to form a delta in the
upper reaches of the reservoir, with a consequent raising of the river bed
and water surfaces in the river reach immediately above the reservoir.
Studies indicate that flooding of additional areas upstream of the reservoir
might occur at some point in the future as a result of back water and aggrada-
tion caused by the reservoir. It was agreed at negotiations that NIA would
include observations on riverbed aggradation as part of a wider reservoir
sedimentation monitoring program, in order to allow adequate lead time for
remedial measures. Construction of the dam and formation of the reservoir
would have no effects on existing health conditions in the area or on fisheries.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The National Irrigation Administration
4.01      NIA was created in 1964 and given responsibilities for developing,
operating and maintaining all national irrigation systems in the Philippines.
The Government finances NIA through the sale of bonds or from appropriations.
A board of directors is responsible for the agency and the Administrator, who
is appointed by the President of the Philippines, handles management. NIA
has recently been reorganized to better deal with the requirements of the
Government's policy of irrigation development. The integration of the major
foreign-assisted projects under a Special Projects Organization (SPO) headed
by an Assistant Administrator was one of the first results of the reorgani-
zation (Figure 4.1). The SPO is currently responsible for twelve major
projects and has built-up a structure and staff which, with specialist
consultant input where necessary, is competent to implement large-scale
projects and manage the operations and maintenance of irrigation works. The
Presidential Decree authorizing construction of MRMP designated NIA as the
lead agency and directed other agencies, that might be involved in the
implementation and operation of the project other than its irrigation
phase, to cooperate with NIA as necessary. In view of the planned power
generation component (Package III) of the project, the other principal agency
is the National Power Corporation (NPC).
National Power Corporation
4.02      NPC, originally a public utility responsible for hydroelectric
power generation, is a stock corporation fully owned by the Government. In
1972 a Presidential Decree made NPC responsible for the construction of
national power grids, the development of all future generation supplying the
grids and, ultimately for owning and operating all generating facilities.
Its corporate powers are vested in a Board of seven members including the
General Manager who is Vice-Chairman. The Secretary of the Department of
Energy, established in October 1977 to formulate policies and programs and
coordinate all activities connected with electric power, is chairman of the
NPC Board. Power generation for the Luzon grid in 1976 was 9,350 GWh with a
peak of about 1,600 MW. The average annual rate of growth is forecast at
about 10% with energy demand of 17,780 GWh and capacity demand of 3,220 MW by
1983. The current Luzon system development program (Annex 2) plans to meet
the load growth by construction of 457 MW thermal power, 300 MW pumped
storage hydro, 364 MW (7 x 52 MW units) geothermal power and the assumed
availability of 360 MW hydro power from Magat by 1983. A 620 MW nuclear
plant is currently under construction and is expected to be in full commission
in 1984. An ongoing review of the NPC generation expansion program for the
Luzon mainland by international consultants (Lahmayer International, Germany)
has estimated the power demand growth rate at 11.5% through the 1977-85
period. Their forecast is based on a correlation between economic and
population growth but is believed to be an over-estimate of potential demand.
However, the probability of delays in NPC commissioning the geothermal power
units and the load growth rate currently assumed, makes the availability of
power from Magat in 1983 a vital component in the power development program
in order to avoid power shortages since the reserve of the interconnected
system would only be 13.5% without the Magat power component.

Project Management
4.03      NIA.  Responsibility for implementing Stage I of the MRMP (Loan
1154-PH) was placed under the SP0. A Project Manager was appointed, with an
Assistant Project Manager directly in charge of three construction divisions,
dealing respectively with the ADB-assisted rehabilitation of MARlS and the
Bank-assisted MARIS extension and SIFRIS rehabilitation and expansion. The
MRMP Project Manager subsequently assumed overall responsibility for the
construction of the nearby Chico River Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH) and
for the Cagayan Integrated Area Development Project, with day to day respon-
sibility for MRMP in the hands of an Assistant Project Manager. The MRMP
Project Manager has thus become Regional Manager for SPO projects in the
Cagayan Valley. In view of the scope and engineering complexity of the Magat
dam construction, NIA, after consultation with the Bank, has transferred to
the MRMP senior engineering staff with expertise acquired on the recently
completed Pantabangan dam (Loan 637-PH). Management of construction of the
Magat dam would be the responsibility of the senior staff engineer from this
group who has been designated Project Manager, MRMP Dam. He liaises with the
Regional Project Manager on overall MRMP policy, but has full powers in all
matters concerning the dam and has direct access to the SPO Assistant Adminis-
trator and the Administrator (Figure 4.2). Assurances were obtained that NIA
would periodically review with the Bank the effectiveness of the proposed
project management organization.
4.04      Under a ruling of the Water Resources Council, the competent
authority in the Philippines, the reservoir would be operated primarily for
irrigation with a firm energy rule of 25 MW continuous monthly power produc-
tion (para. 3.10). Consequently, NIA would be responsible for operation of
the dam. After completion of construction of the dam it would become an
integral part of the MRMP for operation and maintenance purposes. A Dam
Division would be established which would be responsible for O&M of the main
dam and would absorb the smaller existing unit looking after operation and
maintenance of the MARIS diversion dam and main canal.
4.05      NPC.  Responsibility for construction of the planned power component
(Package III) lies with NPC. As design of the power component is fixed by
the dam, spillway and power intake physical layout, the critical factors will
be scheduling of contract awards, equipment delivery and installation and
commissioning of the generating units and transmission lines. A joint
NIA/NPC Technical Committee has been established to coordinate implementation
of the dam and power facility. No problems are anticipated, subject to
availability of financing. An assurance was obtained that the Government
would cause NPC to establish an effective staff organization to implement the
power component in consultation with the Bank, and that it would periodically
review the effectiveness of the organization with the Bank.

Consulting Services
4.06      While NIA has acquired valuable experience of large dam construc-
tion on the Pantabangan dam, the particular design and construction problems
associated with the proposed Magat dam are sufficiently complex to warrant
substantial consultant assistance to NIA. The project would provide for con-
sultant services to cover the expected period of construction from July 1978
to December 1982. NIA proposes to use the same joint venture of expatriate
and local consulting firms that has been involved in the pre-construction
phase of the project. Negotiations for provision of consulting services
have been completed. It is estimated that about 1,130 man-months of consul-
tant services would be required. The expatriate firms would provide 540 man-
months at an average cost of US$7,900/man-month, exclusive of transportation,
equipment and price escalation. The local associates would provide 590 man-
months at an average cost of US$2,500/man-month. The provision for consul-
tants also covers the requirements of the power component (Package III),
as it would be impractical to make separate arrangements. Direct NIA coun-
terpart and support services to the consultants would total some 1,640 man-
months. The consultant contract would provide for special on-the-job
training, together with 90-day periods of overseas training in Canada and the
U.S.A. for 14 of NIA's engineers. NIA has engaged consultants satisfactory
to the Bank under terms of reference and conditions approved by the Bank to
assist in final design and supervision of construction.
4.07      The NIA Board of Consultants (NBC), an international specialist
technical review panel established in May 1977 in accordance with Bank
requirements, has met four times during the preconstruction phase of the
project, and has made most valuable contributions. The project would provide
for continuance of the NBC during the construction phase. The NBC is expected
to meet at least twice a year and more frequently, if necessary. The Board
currently consists of a geological/geotechnical specialist, a dam hydraulics
specialist and an experienced dam design and construction engineer. Composi-
tion of the Board would be subject to addition and/or amendment by NIA as
particular areas requiring attention develop. An assurance was obtained
that NIA would maintain the Board of Consultants for the duration of construc-
tion of the dam and that NBC would be consulted prior to implementation of
all significant changes in the design and construction plans for Magat dam as
detailed in the contract drawings and specifications.
Safety of Dam
4.08      An assurance was obtained that NIA would make arrangements to have
a suitable maintenance and inspection program for the dam and to advise the
Bank in writing not later than December 31, 1981 as to how it proposes to
meet this obligation. The NIA proposal would include a description and
scheduling of the maintenance program and inspections to be made, the
designation of the experts, if any, to be employed, and, if applicable, a
copy of their terms of reference. The Bank would have an opportunity to
comment on the proposals before they were adopted.

Cost Recovery
4.09      The cost recovery index was examined for the combination of MRMP
Stages I and II since part of the irrigation benefits of Stage II accrue to
areas under Stage I. Based on financial projections of NPC,/1 it would have
to sell energy in 1983 at US$0.0317 kWh (mid '78 price level) to obtain an 8%
rate of return on revalued net fixed assets. At this tariff level, NPC could
carry on its account the cost of the power house, power equipment, and about
73% of the cost of the dam and still obtain an 8% rate of return on its
assets./2 Allocation of assets between NIA and NPC would not be made at
present; however, an assurance was obtained from the Government that, within
three years of loan signature, a proposal for allocation of the costs of the
dam between the two agencies would be presented to the Bank for review. In
view of NPC's need for funds, and in order to maintain its creditworthiness,
it would be desirable that the cost of Magat dam allocated to power would be
assumed by the Government in the form of equity contributions to NPC.
However, a final decision on the issue would be taken by the Government as
part of the cost allocation determination. Since the project would provide a
more reliable supply of water than other Bank-assisted irrigation projects
and since the average farm size in the project area is somewhat larger, an
increase in the water charges is justified. Based on the capacity of the
farmers to pay, an increase equivalent to 1 cavan of paddy/ha in each season
over the present charges on Bank-assisted projects of 3.5 cavans/ha in the
wet season and 4.4 cavans/ha in the dry season would be appropriate. An
assurance was obtained from the Government that, within a period of five
years after full development, water charges would be gradually increased to
these levels and that NIA and the Bank would review annually the adequacy and
collection rate of water charges. Based on the above water charges and power
tariff levels, the overall cost recovery index at discount rates of 8%, 10%,
and 12%, is 62%, 47%, and 37% respectively. Assuming that the powerhouse,
power equipment and 73% of the dam were allocated to NPC, the cost recovery
index of the irrigation component would be 17% at a discount rate of 10%.

5. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
5.01      The second stage of development of the Magat River Multipurpose
Project would consist of construction of the Magat dam, establishment of a
generating station with a 360 MW installed capacity and new irrigation
facilities for an additional 27,000 ha of rainfed land. The proposed Bank
loan would assist in financing construction of the dam. The Government
plans to obtain supplier credit for the power component of the Stage II
development and intends to approach the Bank for assistance with the irri-
gation component. While Stage II development of MRMP has been subdivided
into a number of convenient packages for implementation and financing, for
purposes of economic evaluation the development is indivisible. For example,
the investment in the dam cannot be justified without assuming further
investments in irrigation and power and the resulting benefits. The Stage II
development is therefore evaluated as a single entity. The following analysis
will show that the investment in Stage II development has an acceptable
overall economic rate of return. It will also show that this investment is
the least cost method of meeting the proposed irrigation and power objectives.
5.02      Foreign Exchange.  The numeraire used for this analysis is present
real income at constant prices, measured in terms of foreign exchange and
expressed in U.S. dollars. All local costs and benefits denominated in pesos
have been multiplied by the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 and
divided by the official exchange rate of P 7.40 = US$1.00 to convert them to
the numeraire.
5.03      Investment Costs.  The total shadow-priced capital cost of the
Stage II investment, expressed in mid-1978 prices, is US$443.5 million. This
total cost includes US$52.9 million for the diversion works, US$273.6 million
for the dam, US$70.9 million for the power related civil works and equipment,
and US$46.1 million for the irrigation works. All capital costs include
physical contingencies but exclude costs due to expected price increases as
well as duties and taxes on imported equipment. The annual operation and
maintenance costs, estimated at US$2.8 million, consist of US$0.76 million
for the irrigation at US$28/ha, US$0.54 million for the dam and US$1.5 million
for the power facilites based on the PDR.
5.04      Irrigation Benefits.  Completion of Stage II MRMP development would
provide an additional 27,000 ha of rice land with year round irrigation. At
present, in the wet season a rainfed rice crop is grown on 21,200 ha of this
land, while 5,800 ha are irrigated by small run-of-river and pump irrigation
systems. In the dry season only 2,100 ha are cropped to irrigated rice.
Construction of the Magat dam would also provide irrigation water to a
further 46,000 ha in the dry season. This area, equipped with irrigation
facilities under Stage I of MRMP, presently remains uncultivated in the dry
season due to lack of water. On completion of Stage II development, approxi-
mately 8,000 farm families and 4,400 landless laborers' families would
benefit from increased production and additional employment within the
Stage II area, together with about 15,000 farm families and 5,500 landless
families in the Stage I area. The incremental annual demand for farm labor
would be of about 7.2 million man-days equivalent to some 36,000 full time
jobs.



- 34 -
5.05      Present paddy yields in the project area are 1.5 ton/ha for rainfed
rice, 2.0 ton/ha for wet season irrigated rice, and 2.1 ton/ha for dry-season
irrigated rice. Without the project, paddy yields are expected to increase
to 1.8 ton/ha, 2.5 ton/ha and 2.6 ton/ha respectively. With the project,
these yields are expected to increase to 4.0 ton/ha for wet season irrigated
rice and 4.2 ton/ha for dry season irrigated rice. Present cropping intensity
is 107% which is expected to remain unchanged without the project. With the
project, cropping intensity is expected to reach 200%. Paddy production at
full Stage II development would increase by about 356,500 tons annually
resulting in a yearly import saving of about US$69.0 million. After deducting
the cost of imported fertilizer and chemicals, the net foreign exchange
saving would amount to about US$62.0 million.
5.06      Since the Cagayan valley is a rice surplus area, the incremental
rice production from MRMP is expected to be sold for consumption in Manila.
According to the Bank's commodity price forecasts, the world market price of
Thai 25-35% broken rice is expected to rise (in constant 1978 prices) from
US$230/ton f.o.b. Bangkok in 1978 to US$290/ton in 1985. These prices were
used to estimate present and future farm-gate prices for the economic analysis
and for estimating farm incomes. A summary of economic and financial farm-
gate prices for rice and fertilizers is shown in Table 5.1. Detailed calcu-
lations of prices, production costs, labor demand, and farm budgets are shown
in Annex 2.

/a   Includes off-farm income.
5.07      Farm incomes, calculated for the average farm size of 3.0 ha and
for two different types of tenure are summarized in Table 5.2. The present per
capita incomes for the 3.0 ha farm model ranging from US$80 for a leaseholder
to US$135 for an owner operator are below the estimated per capita absolute
poverty level of US$193 (at 1978 prices), and vary from 16% to 27% of the
estimated 1978 per capita GNP of US$507 for the Philippines. With the
project, the per capita incomes of these farms would increase to about US$475
for an owner operator and US$305 for a leaseholder. Thus, average incomes in
the project area would rise above the 1978 poverty income level by the time
of full development, and would range between 41% and 64% of the 1987 projected
per capita GNP of US$745. The comparison indicates that the project would
increase incomes in the project area considerably and would help narrow the
income gap between the project area and other parts of the country, and
between urban and rural areas.
5.08      As a result of Stage II development, the demand for labor would
increase from 2.77 million man-days annually without the project to 10.0 mil-
lion man-days with the project. In order to value the incremental cost of
labor, shadow wage rates were calculated by examining the impact of Stage I
and Stage II development together on the total project area. This analysis
showed that the shadow wage rate would be P 2.67/man-day without the project
and P 3.06/man-day with the project, resulting in an incremental labor cost
of P 23.2 million due to the project (Annex 2). Using the above assumptions,
the incremental benefits due to irrigation would amount to US$47.4 million
annually at full development, as shown in Table 5.3.
5.09      Power Benefits.  With an installed capacity of 360 MW, the project
would generate about 1,200 GWh annually. In quantifying power benefits,
ideally both the capacity and energy contribution would have to be given
economic values. As a simplification, these benefits have been expressed
in terms of the price per kWh consumers would be willing to pay for the
energy. Since it was not possible to measure willingness to pay directly,
the retail tariff was taken as a minimum measure of the consumers' willing-
ness to pay ignoring consumers' surplus and the possibility that the market
clearing rate might be higher than the actual tariff. In Luzon, the retail

prices charged by cooperatives, some of whom buy power from NPC, range from
P 0.24/kWh to P 0.94/kWh, averaging around P 0.33 per kWh./1   Retail tariffs
charged by cooperatives /2 which buy cheap power from the NPC grid are
generally lower than the retail tariffs charged by cooperatives which generate
their own powe-.  Based on these data, electricity consumers are willing to
pay at least P 0.33/kWh for energy. At P 0.33/kWh, the value of MRMP's
output, after accounting for a 9% loss due to transmission and distribution,
would be US$43.8 million.
5.10      Since MRMP's energy output has been valued at the retail level, an
incremental investment of about US$60.0 million, for transmission and
distribution facilities, was deducted from this value. The annual cost of
operation and maintenance of the transmission and distribution facilities has
been estimated at US$1.35 million. /3
5.11      Development Period.  According to the Stage II implementation
schedule, all works would be completed by December 31, 1982. The already
developed 46,000 ha Stage I area is assumed to reach full development three
years after completion of the dam. Farmers on the 27,000 ha of newly irrigated
land are assumed to begin growing their crops under improved conditions from
1983 onward and to achieve the projected full development yield levels over
five years in equal installments by 1987. The power benefits are assumed to
accrue the year after completion of construction of the dam.
5.12      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting investment costs and irrigation and power benefits over a 50
year evaluation period, the economic rate of return of the project is 12%
(Table 5.4). At a discount rate of 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of
capital in the Philippines, the net present value of the project in 1978 is
US$109.0 million.

unavailable, only retail tariffs charged by cooperatives have been
considered.
/3 The incremental transmission investment required is the cost of the second
circuit between Santiago and Ambuklao and related substations totalling
US$11.0 million. The cost of the 14 km transmission line from Magat to
Santiago is included in the Magat power component (Package III) cost
estimates. The incremental distribution investment has been estimated at
US$49.0 million. The annual cost of operation and maintenance of the
transmission facilities was estimated at 1.0% of capital cost, and for
the distribution facilities at USiO.11/kWh supplied at the retail level.

Sensitivity of the rate of return was tested to cost overruns, delays in
implementation of the power and irrigation components, delay in both irri-
gation and power benefits as a result of delays in dam construction accom-
panied by a 20% increase in costs, variations in the price and yields of
rice, variations in the estimated willingness to pay for energy and an
increase in incremental energy transmission and distribution costs (Table
5.5). The rate of return was most sensitive to a combination of cost over-
runs and delays in benefits.
5.13      Least Cost Analysis.  To see whether the Stage II investment is
the least costly way of providing the expected irrigation and power benefits,
it has been compared to alternative irrigation and power projects. The
only feasible method of obtaining equivalent irrigation benefits would
consist of the present Stage II investment minus the power generation faci-
lities. There would be no change in the main dam height or in the appurte-
nant works, other than the absence of the power intake facilities. This
alternative would have a capital cost of US$372.6 million and an annual
operation and maintenance cost of US$1.3 million. Because the long-range
development program beyond about 1987 is not yet well defined, the comparison
of alternative power developments to meet energy requirements in the Luzon
grid in 1983 has been confined to comparing the power output of Magat with a
thermal alternative. There are no other indigenous substitutes as none of
the potential hydroplants, presently in the feasibility stage, could come on
the line before 1985. To maintain in the system the same reliability as is
the case with Magat, a thermal plant with an installed capacity of 300 MW
would be required. Studies indicate that the best solution would comprise a
combination of a 100 MW steam power plant supported by a 200 MW gas turbine
plant using the gas turbines to cover peaking operation with a 5% plant
factor. The capital cost for the steam plant, with an economic life of
25 years, has been estimated at US$450/kW and for the gas turbine plant, with
a life of 15 years, at US$250/kW. Since the alternative thermal plants would
be built near Manila, the associated incremental transmission investment
would be negligible. Annual operating costs for these plants have been
estimated at US$29.2 million which include fuel costs for generating
1,200 GWh at an average cost of P 0.18/kWh. For the analysis, capital costs
have been shadow-priced for a foreign exchange content of 75% for the steam
plant and 85% for the gas turbine. Comparison of the Stage II investment to
these alternative series of investments (Table 5.6) shows that the net
present value of the MRMP investment is lower for all discount rates below
43%, which is the equalizing discount rate. At a discount rate of 10%, the
estimated opportunity cost of capital in the Philippines, the net present
value of the Stage II investment in 1978 is lower than that of the alternative
by US$181 million.

5.14      Risks.  NIA has successfully completed the construction of a large
multipurpose dam at Pantabangan in Central Luzon (Loan 637-PH) and all the
experienced senior personnel from that job are now assigned to the proposed
Magat dam (para. 4.03). In addition, despite the fact that a remarkable
amount of exploratory work has already been carried out at the site (para.
3.11), adequate provision has been made in the estimates for unexpected
contingencies. Thus, while no major problems are anticipated in construction
of the Magat dam and appurtenant works, a delay in completion of the diversion
tunnels or the occurrence of abnormally high wet-season floods at the early
stages of dam construction would constitute the principal risk factor. Such
events could result in the loss of one construction season.

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations agreement with the Government was reached on
the following principal points:
(a)  it would satisfy the Bank of the economic and technical justi-
fication of any increase in installed generating capacity above
360 MW (para. 3.10);
(b) NIA would keep the Bank informed of the arrangements to be made
for resettlement of the affected population and the Bank would
have an opportunity to comment before they were implemented
(para. 3.19);
(c) it would undertake to construct the power and irrigation phases
of Stage II development in a timely manner so as to be ready for
operation by January 1, 1983 (para 3.22);
(d) any contractual and financial arrangements proposed for
implementation of the power component of Stage II development
would be subject to review by the Bank prior to conclusion of
such agreements (para. 3.22);
(e) NIA would make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with
a qualified supplier for the timely provision of the spillway,
power intake and Baligatan creek gates (para 3.23);
(f) it would submit for review by the Bank within three years of loan
signature a plan for allocation of costs of the dam between NIA and
NPC (para. 4.09); and
(g) NIA would gradually raise the water rates payable by the benefi-
ciaries in the service area by the equivalent of 1 cavan of paddy/ha
in each crop season above the 3.5 and 4.4 cavans/ha levels pre-
vailing in Stage I of the project. The incremental rate would
begin to be applied five years after completion of Stage II and
would be fully applied over five years (para. 4.09);
6.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan would be that NIA would
establish a special fund to service the project which would be replenished by
the Government at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated
requirement for the next two months (para 3.23).
6.03      The proposed project would be suitable for a Bank loan of
US$150.0 million for a period of 20 years including 5 years of grace. The
borrower would be the Republic of the Philippines.
