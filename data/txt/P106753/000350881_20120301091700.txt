                      quality services for the people of Pernambuco.

Program Development   The proposed operation is fully aligned with all four of the strategic
Objective(s) and      priorities identified under the FY12-15 World Bank Group Country
Contribution to CAS   Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Brazil. The operation specifically
                      focuses on promoting a more equitable, sustainable and competitive
                      Pernambuco by supporting the State’s agenda of interiorização,
                      integrating the hinterland more closely into the development of the
                      State. More specifically, the program supports the establishment of a
                      policy and regulatory framework in the State to comprehensively
                      address issues of social inequity and gender inclusion, with emphasis
                      on the non-metropolitan areas.
                      The operation faces a series of risks, including: (i) institutional risks
                      due to low capacity in targeted areas under the operation; (ii) social
                      risks related to potential distributional impacts on segments of the
                      population; and (iii) economic and fiscal risks related to prudent
                      management of the State of Pernambuco’s fiscal position in an
                      uncertain global environment. In order to mitigate against these risks,
                      the Bank and the Borrower have conducted a thorough analysis of the
Risks and Risk
                      poverty and social impacts, as well as the strength of the fiscal
Mitigation
                      position of the State under different scenarios. The results show that
                      the distributional impacts of the policies supported by the operation
                      are unambiguously positive. The fiscal position of the State is strong
                      and shows that there is room to manage potential shocks that are not
                      under the control of the State. With regards to institutional risks, the
                      Bank has initiated a dialogue with the Borrower on its plan for
                      capacity building.

consolidates the Bank’s long-term engagement with the State of Pernambuco, particularly in
the areas of education, water resource management, public sector management and poverty
reduction. The operation will support the State’s strategy to reduce inequality, particularly in
the context of the Government’s agenda of interiorização. The latter is a strategy for balanced
regional development throughout the State that aims to expand economic opportunities and
reduce inequities in access to public services, quality education, and jobs.

2.      The State of Pernambuco is the second largest economy in northeast Brazil. It is
also one of the poorest, most poorly educated and most vulnerable states to natural and
social hazards. Pernambuco accounted in 2009 for 2.4 percent of the national gross domestic
product (GDP), while its population—9 million inhabitants— represented 4.6 percent of total
national population. Like other northeastern states, it has long lagged behind the rest of Brazil,
with a GDP per capita, also in 2009, of R$8,901.9—about half of the national average.
Pernambuco’s GDP growth performance was also below the rate for Brazil and the northeast
during the last decades of the twentieth century (World Bank, 2002). Social outcomes are also
below the national average in Pernambuco. In 2009, the share of the population below the
poverty line was twice that of Brazil and well above the Northeastern average. On most
measures of quality, schools lag behind those in the rest of the country. Life expectancy in
Pernambuco is below the Brazilian average (68 years in the State versus 69.3 years
nationwide) (IBGE). The incidence of contagious diseases such as tuberculosis and dengue
fever is significant and poor sanitation conditions prevail.1 The state is also very exposed to
natural disasters. Occupation of the semi-arid region and urbanization in the coastal area has
made the State vulnerable to both droughts and flooding.

3.      Pernambuco remains a very unequal State with highly concentrated economic
opportunities and strong spatial disparities. Divisions exist along several dimensions,
including geography, ethnicity, gender, and sector of economic activity. Household per capita
income in the interior of the State was half that of the Metropolitan Area of Recife (MAR) in
2009; more than 70 percent of the State’s GDP is produced in the coastal area and poverty
rates are systematically higher in non-metropolitan areas. Moreover, ethnic and racial origins,
as well as gender overlap with geographic factors to aggravate inequities: poverty incidence
among the non-white population in the interior of the State is four times higher that of the
white population in the MAR. Economic opportunities for women are more limited than those
for men throughout the State, and lower quality employment and labor force participation are
more prevalent in the interior. The average income gap between male and female employees
is about 20 percent after controlling for hours worked and individual characteristics of the

                                                1
workers. Natural risk factors are also framed along geographic lines and coincide with areas
of high poverty, further aggravating opportunities for balanced poverty reduction.

4.     The geographic dimension of inequality is particularly salient, and economic
progress has not been shared equally within the State. Access to social services and their
quality are geographically imbalanced. Divergence in education enrollment rates between
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas remain significant at the secondary school level,
with 33 percent enrollment of 15-17 year olds in the interior, as compared with nearly 50
percent of their counterparts in the MAR in 2009. The same pattern holds with the State’s
scarce water resources. Eighty-nine percent of households in the MAR had access to water,
compared to only 66 percent of the households in the interior in 2009. Access to water has a
strong bearing on health outcomes, such as child and maternal mortality. These inequities
have made it difficult to enhance social cohesion and productivity, and the State has selected
them as a priority to be tackled by ongoing reforms.

5.      The State faces two main challenges: to consolidate its current growth rate; and,
to turn the recent higher growth into lower poverty and inequality outcomes. Following
more than two decades of low and declining growth, in 2003, Permanbuco started an
accelerated growth period, with growth rates on par with the national average. This economic
rebound was further supported by the development of the Suape Port in 2007, which helped
shift the drivers of growth from agriculture to industry. The port has attracted a massive influx
of public and private investments to MAR.

6.      In order to tackle socioeconomic challenges, the State has to boost investment.
After stagnating since the eighties, investment levels have doubled since 2004 (as percentage
of net consolidated revenue) and are expected to continue growing for the next ten years. This
expansion will only be sustainable if the improvement in the State’s revenue generating
capacity is accompanied by an increase in borrowing, taking advantage of the current low
debt ratio. Due to growing fiscal revenues and consistent fiscal adjustment, net consolidated
debt fell steeply from over 104 percent of net consolidated revenue in 2004 to 39 percent by
2010, well within the 200 percent limit imposed by the Law of Fiscal Responsibility.

7.     The proposed DPL is a multi-sectoral operation integrating growth and equity-
oriented policy reforms that are directly linked to the strategic objectives outlined by the
Pernambuco Government in its Strategy Map. The three main areas of the Strategy Map
are:
i)     Improving the quality of life of the citizens of Pernambuco, by improving access to
       quality services and protecting the citizens and their property from crime and climate-
       related hazards.
ii)    Changing the pattern of growth (the so-called New Economy) by strengthening
       linkages between the most dynamic sectors and the rest of the State’s economy.
iii)   Establishing conditions for better government, by increasing the capacity and
       efficiency of public administration to generate concrete results for the citizens of
       Pernambuco.


8.     This DPL aims to support policies that will enable the conditions for a
sustainable growth path and a more equitable economy and society. The equity
dimensions of the operation relate to three specific dimensions: (i) a more even distribution of
                                               2
economic activity throughout the State; (ii) more opportunities for disadvantaged
socioeconomic groups, mainly through regional targeting of interventions; and (iii) an
emphasis on horizontal equity, particularly in relation to gender.

9.      The proposed operation seeks to further the Government’s reform agenda to
increase opportunities for development, while addressing issues of equity among
traditionally excluded groups. The reforms supported by the DPL deepen recent progress in
Pernambuco by focusing on key sectors, such as water, education, public sector reform, and
economic development, while ensuring that the benefits of the reforms reach vulnerable
populations in the interior as well as women. The Program is fully aligned with the priorities
of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2015 (Report # 63731-BR)
(CPS) to promote a more equitable, sustainable and competitive Pernambuco, including the
integration of a strong gender focus. The program also facilitates the Bank’s strategic
engagement in key areas of the State’s development plan.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL

10.     Brazil’s relative resilience to the global financial crisis reflected good
macroeconomic management and a solid financial system. Following the global crisis in
September 2008, Brazil suffered a sudden reduction in external and domestic credit, and
significant currency depreciation. Rapidly falling external demand and a sharp decline in
investment led to a 4.2 percent contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth
quarter of 2008 followed by a 2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2009. The recession,
however, lasted only those two quarters. Prompt response by the authorities avoided a credit
crunch, and mitigated the impact of the global financial crisis on the Brazilian economy,
which recovered rapidly. Fiscal policy was appropriately countercyclical in 2009 and
remained expansionary in 2010, driven by strong rigidities in current expenditures, the
political cycle, and difficulties in quickly reversing the countercyclical measures enacted in
the previous year. After contracting by 0.6 percent in 2009, the economy grew at a 7.5 percent
annual rate in 2010.

11.     At least until mid 2011, large portfolio inflows exerted a strong upward pressure
on the real and were accompanied by growing private sector indebtedness. The currency,
which had already appreciated by 11.9 percent in 2010, traded at a high of R$1.59 per US
dollar at the end of August 2011, a 44 percent appreciation since the start of 2009. The
Central Bank rapidly accumulated international reserves, reaching US$350 billion in
November 2011 (up from US$238.5 billion in December 2009). This was accompanied,
however, by an increase of about 50 percent in Brazil's external debt, from US$198 billion in
2009 to US$301.5 billion in end-November 2011, of which 15 percent had a maturity of up to
360 days. Broadly defined gross external debt, however, including intercompany loans and
nonresident holdings of domestic fixed income instruments, has also increased significantly,
from US$373.4 billion to US$537.3 billion between 2009 and November 2011. Private sector
gross external indebtedness, in particular, rose 65 percent over this period, reaching US$344.5
billion. The biggest increase occurred among banks, whose gross external debt reached
$140.7 billion, a 121 percent increase with respect to December 2009.


                                              3
12.    To address risks of overheating, in 2010 the Central Bank adopted a
contractionary monetary policy stance, complemented with a tighter fiscal policy in
2011. Consumer price inflation (IPCA), as measured by the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics (IBGE), closed 2010 at 5.91 percent. To control inflation, the Central Bank
increased the policy rate by 375 basis points, starting in April 2010, to 12.5 percent in June
2011. Furthermore, in February, 2011, the Government announced cuts in budgeted
expenditures of R$50 billion, which, coupled with strong revenue performance enabled it to
generate a primary surplus of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2011, compared to 2.4 percent in 2010
(see Table 1 for Key Macroeconomic Indicators).

13.     While inflation continued accelerating during most of 2011, starting in August
2011, the Central Bank eased its policy stance in response to the worsening global
economic outlook. During most of 2011, labor market conditions have tightened, with record
levels of job creation and historically low unemployment (5.2 percent in November 2011).

                                                                      4
Inflation reached 6.5 percent in 2011, in line with the upper limit of the inflation target.
However, since August 31, 2011, in response to a perceived deterioration in the outlook for
global growth and the expectation that it will have a disinflationary impact in Brazil, the
Central Bank has reduced its policy rate by 200 basis points to 10.5 percent. Moreover, in
November, 2011, the Central Bank significantly reduced capital requirements for consumer
loans, in some cases by 50 percent. On the fiscal policy front, however, the Government
intends to maintain its current contractionary policy stance. In particular, it has announced a
commitment to primary surplus targets of 3.1 percent of GDP in both 2012 and 2013.

14.     Economic activity decelerated significantly during the second half of 2011
reflecting both domestic and external factors. On one hand, the deceleration was driven by
the tighter monetary and fiscal policy stances adopted by the Government during the first half
of the year. On the other hand, the fiscal crisis in the Euro zone has led to a worsening of the
global economic outlook coupled to a reduction in business and consumer confidence. In this
context, GDP exhibited zero growth during the third quarter of 2011, a sharp deceleration
with respect to the 0.8 percent growth observed, on average, during the previous four quarters.
On the supply side, the largest deceleration was observed in industry and services, which
contracted by respectively 0.9 and 0.3 percent in the third quarter, compared to average
quarterly growth of respectively 0.5 and 0.9 percent over the previous year. Among these, the
industrial sector was arguably already being hardly hit by global economic developments, as
reflected in the appreciation of the real and the deceleration of external demand for Brazilian
manufactured products. On the demand side, the deceleration observed during the third
quarter was driven by the contraction of domestic demand, especially government
consumption (-0.7 percent), followed by gross capital formation and household consumption
(respectively -0.2 and -0.1 percent).

15.      More recent data suggest that economic activity continued to be weak in the
fourth quarter, albeit with some signs of moderate recovery starting in November. While
in October industrial production and broadly defined retail sales (including vehicles and
construction material) contracted by respectively 0.6 and 0.4 percent month-on-month
(strictly defined retail sales were flat in that month), they expanded by respectively 0.3 and
1.5 percent in November (1.3 percent for narrow retail sales), and by 0.9 and 1.6 percent in
December (0.3 percent for narrow retail sales). Similarly, the Central Bank’s IBC-Br index, a
proxy for monthly GDP, exhibited a -0.32 percent contraction in October but expanded by
1.15 percent in November.

16.      The banking system appears well prepared to absorb a possible worsening of the
credit portfolio. Early stage delinquency indicators (loans that are between 15 and 90 days
overdue) have been rising gradually over the last year, mainly in the consumer segment (6.9
percent in October 2011 up from 5.3 percent in December 2010). Even though this
development portends higher non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in the upcoming months,
potentially aggravated by the ongoing economic deceleration, banks appear well prepared to
withstand such negative developments. The system-wide solvency ratio currently stands at
around 17 percent, as supervisors have been phasing in tightened capital requirements in
anticipation of Basel III while banks have obtained robust profits which they have been able
to capitalize. Similarly, while housing loans have grown very strongly (47 percent in the year
to October 2011, accounting for 44 percent of growth in bank loans to individuals), there is a
low risk of an ―asset bubble‖ developing in Brazil’s real estate markets. Indeed, those loans
still represent only 10 percent of total private sector credit and their delinquency rates have
                                               5
fallen significantly thanks to the improvement of the mortgage foreclosure system (e.g. loans
overdue for more than 90 days were 5.9 percent in July 2011, down from 23.9 percent in
2006).

17.     The current account has remained stable during 2011 while FDI has exhibited
solid growth even as the global economic outlook has deteriorated. The current account
deficit totaled $48.1 billion in the twelve months to October 2011. FDI, however, totaled
$75.1 billion over the same period, compared to $36 billion in the year to October 2010.
Going forward, the current account deficit is expected to increase slightly in 2012, driven by
lower growth in export prices and a reduction in the trade surplus. While FDI may experience
a moderate reduction in 2012, due to the unfavorable external scenario and a deceleration in
domestic demand, it is expected to remain strong over the medium term and help finance the
majority of the current account deficit.

18.     The prospect for growth in foreign portfolio investments is less positive. Driven
mainly by high real domestic interest rates at a time of exceptionally low interest rates
internationally, these inflows have put strong upward pressure on the real and prompted the
authorities to increase taxes on financial transactions (IOF) of foreign fixed income
investments from 2 to 6 percent in October 2010. This measure, together with recent increases
in global risk aversion associated with the fiscal crisis in Europe, has already caused a
slowdown in portfolio flows. Going forward, these inflows could be negatively affected by
the increased international turmoil. Moreover, while real interest differentials are likely to
remain large, the recent Central Bank decisions to reduce the policy rate will diminish the
stimulus for carry-trade operations. On the positive side, portfolio inflows should benefit from
the recent GoB suspension of IOF taxation on foreign variable income investments

19.     Going forward, a further build-up of reserves is possible in 2012. Persistently
higher domestic interest rates are expected to prompt the private sector to continue increasing
its external indebtedness. In this context, the Central Bank has stepped up its monitoring of
prudential and macro-prudential risks associated with potential currency mismatches by
financial and non-financial companies, by increasing reporting requirements on foreign
borrowing by non-financial corporations. It has also taken measures to mitigate those risks by
tightening regulations on banks’ net open positions and, at least until very recently, by also
tightening capital requirements to curtail credit growth.

Current Macroeconomic Outlook

20.    While GDP growth can be expected to be close to 3 percent in 2011 and 2012, the
medium-term macroeconomic outlook points to an annual GDP growth rate of between
4 and 4.5 percent. In the short term, the forecast is for lower growth compared to previous
periods, as the Brazilian economy suffers the consequences of the deterioration in the global
economic outlook. In the medium term, growth is likely to be driven by strong domestic
aggregate demand. Investment growth, in particular, will be spurred by the development of
new offshore oil fields and preparations for upcoming mega events.

21.    In the short term, the external sector is one of the main sources of Brazil’s
vulnerability to a global slowdown through possible impacts on trade volumes,
commodity prices and exchange rate movements. A worsening of the global economy
caused by a full-blown euro zone debt crisis and/or a US recession, may translate into lower

                                               6
external demand for Brazil’s exports, while a Chinese hard landing would hit Brazil’s terms
of trade, and demand for exports, given the significant demand from China. As the current-
account deficit widens, the Real could weaken slightly in nominal terms against the US dollar,
as was observed during the third quarter of 2011. Nonetheless, Brazil’s vulnerability to
external events will remain low due to its high reserves and favorable debt composition.

22.     Secondly, the banking sector is vulnerable to continued global slowdown given
the exposure of some small and medium sized banks to liquidity risk. Small and medium
sized banks, currently holding 8 percent and 12 percent of the Banking system’s assets still
largely rely on more volatile sources of funding. However, system-wide assessment of banks
indicates that Brazil’s banking system currently has solid liquidity levels and capital cushions.

23.      Further worsening of the global economic environment also poses risk to the
fulfillment of fiscal targets. The achievement of primary surplus targets may be affected by
the deceleration of economic activity, as federal revenues could decline and social protection
expenditures are likely to increase. Moreover, despite the Government’s current commitment
to using mainly monetary policy levers to counter the ongoing economic deceleration, recent
policy measures suggests that it remains open to adopting complementary fiscal and quasi
fiscal stimuli if economic activity were to decelerate more sharply.

24.    In the medium term, Brazil also faces structural challenges that limit its long-
term growth potential. A short list of challenges includes developing a private market for
long-term financing and improving the business environment (in particular, reducing the costs
associated with complying with tax obligations and obtaining business permits and licenses).
Other important issues are the need to increase public and private investment, so as to address
growing infrastructure bottlenecks and achieve faster productivity growth, and that of
improving the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of public expenditures.

25.     Despite the above external risks and domestic policy challenges, the
Government’s overall macroeconomic framework is deemed sustainable in the medium
term and adequate for the purposes of a DPL. Brazil’s fiscal framework (see Box 1 for
more details on Brazilian Fiscal Federalism) provided the government with the flexibility to
successfully respond to the global financial crisis with an array of fiscal, monetary, and
external measures to stimulate domestic demand. Gross public sector debt is expected to
decline in the future, from 63.2 percent of GDP projected for 2011 to around 58.7 percent of
GDP in 2013, despite difficulties in maintaining fiscal balance in the face of large investment
needs and pressures from current expenditure growth. Moreover, flexible exchange rates and
relatively large foreign reserves should help Brazil address the consequences of a potential
external crisis, including a possible abrupt shift in market perceptions and an associated turn-
around in capital flows.

  Box 1: Brazilian Fiscal Federalism and the Control of Sub-National Fiscal Performance
The fiscal stance of Brazilian states has always been an important element in macroeconomic management
in Brazil. Until the late 1990s, the expansionary fiscal policies by the states and the lack of effective
controls over their indebtedness resulted in frequent sub-national debt crises. On three different occasions
(1989, 1993 and 1997) the federal Government had to take on and reschedule the debts of the states. The
largest operation occurred in 1997, under Law 9496, when the federal Government restructured R$200
billion (12 percent of national GDP) of the debts owed by the states.
In the 1997 refinancing operation, the debts were refinanced for 30 years. This refinanced debt, so called
intra-limite debt, carries a real interest rate of 6 percent with the nominal value of the debt rising by
inflation. The debt service was capped at 13 percent of states’ net current revenues. Any debt service
above the 13 percent cap is recapitalized and added to the intra-limite debt stock. At the end of the
contracts (in 2028), if there are residual debt balances, the state must pay off the remainder within 10
years.
The 1997 bailout was conditioned upon the state’s compliance with medium-term fiscal adjustment and
structural reform programs. In exchange for the rescue package, the debt renegotiation contracts mandate
the implementation of three-year rolling Programs of Fiscal Adjustment (PAFs) to be agreed upon by the
National Treasury Secretariat and the 25 states that had their debt rescued by the National Treasury
Secretariat during the period of the contract. The PAFs set annual targets on indebtedness, primary
balances, personnel spending, tax revenue and public investment, in order to guarantee a gradual decline in
indebtedness. In addition, the PAFs include structural reforms such as privatization or other public sector
modernization initiatives.
The controls on sub-national fiscal performance were further strengthened by the approval of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal—LRF) in 2000. The LRF institutionalized fiscal
discipline at all levels of government, incorporating hard budget constraints into a single unifying
framework. It explicitly prohibits debt refinancing operations between different levels of government,
thereby addressing the moral hazard problem in intergovernmental fiscal relations caused by sequential
bailouts. Complementary Senate resolutions also prohibit borrowing if: (i) the net consolidated debt
exceeds twice net current revenue (RLC—Receita Liquida Corrente) (ii) new credit operations exceed 16
percent of RLC; and (iii) debt service exceeds 11.5 percent of RLC. Borrowing is also prohibited if it
violates the debt reduction schedules set by the debt renegotiation contracts under the Law 9496. Finally,
emission of sub-national governments bonds is generally prohibited through 2016; however, states whose
net debt is less than net current revenue can issue bonds after 2011, although even here the Federal
Government retains the option to review the decision to issue bonds.
This system of controls has resulted in repeated state and municipal surpluses—an adjustment that has
continued through four federal administrations. In addition, this system has also favored the adoption of
appropriate expenditure programs by sub-national governments. Besides the controls on indebtedness,
LRF requirements improved transparency and strengthened budgetary practices.
Transparency: budget outturns and compliance with the LRF—including a statement of corrective
measures if the relevant provisions are breached—are reported on a regular basis. Municipalities and states
are also required to report the fiscal outturns of the previous year to the Ministry of Finance. The
legislative branch of each level of government, aided by their respective Court of Accounts, monitors
observance with the fiscal targets and ceilings.
Budget Institutions: the LRF introduces more stringent requirements on fiscal targets in the preparation of
the Budget Guidelines Law (Lei de Diretrizes Orcamentárias—LDO), strengthening its role in budget
preparation and fiscal management in general. The LRF also calls for a detailed assessment of the
government’s contingent liabilities and strengthens the link between the Annual Budget Law (Lei de
Orçamento Annual—LOA) and the LDO. A complementary Fiscal Crime Law is applied to all levels of
the public administration, with the possibility of detention for those public officials not complying with the
LRF.

B. RECENT  SOCIOECONOMIC                    AND       FISCAL       DEVELOPMENTS             IN
   PERNAMBUCO

Historical background and political context

26.     Pernambuco is located in the middle of Brazil´s northeast alongside the South
Atlantic Ocean and is closer to US and European markets than the most developed
regions of the country. It has borders with five other states of the region. This geographic
position makes the State a key distributor of goods and services to a growing regional market.
Most of the State is located in the natural disaster-prone semi-arid zone and displays sharp
inequalities in economic and social development. Given its history, Pernambuco has
transformed radically from its agriculture-based past to become an economy mainly driven by
services and commerce and, more recently, by industrial sector growth. Agriculture today
represents less than 10 percent of its GDP while more than 60 percent of the Pernambuco
economy is in the service sector.

27.     Politically, the reelection of Governor Eduardo Campos in 2010 with a wide
margin has enabled his administration to carry out important reforms in the economic,
social and political arena. The reform agenda has been accompanied by a strengthening of a
new model for planning and accountability for the public sector in Pernambuco.

Macroeconomic Environment

28.    The State of Pernambuco is the second largest economy in the northeast of
Brazil. Pernambuco accounted for about 2.3 percent of the national gross domestic product
(GDP) ranking as the tenth economy of the country in 2008. Pernambuco’s population of 9
million inhabitants represents 4.6 percent of total national population. Pernambuco, like other
northeastern states, has long lagged the rest of Brazil in terms of socio economic development
with a GDP per capita about half the national average at R$8,065 in 2008.

29.     The State has entered a new growth period in the last eight years. After a period
of stagnation, the year 2003 marked an inflexion point for State growth and the
beginning of an accelerated growth period that puts the State on par with national
average growth rates. Estimates for 2010 indicate that Pernambuco’s real growth was 9.3
percent, against the 7.5 percent Brazilian GDP growth (Figure 1 shows 5-year average growth
rates). This is a result of the dynamics linked to the Suape Port Complex, and the State’s
increased capacity to invest in physical and social infrastructure due to fiscal strengthening
and growth itself. The Government plans to continue and even accelerate its pace of
investment in the medium term in partnership with the private sector and the federal
Government.

    Note: The poverty line is defined as the double of the extreme poverty line, which is defined as the cost of a basic food
    basket that supplies the minimum individual caloric intake. The poverty line varies between regions, states, urban, rural and
    metropolitan areas. Poverty lines account for these differences.


30.    Recent growth fostered the creation of formal jobs that enabled Pernambuco to
sharply reduce its unemployment rate. The unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of
Recife, which accounts for 42 percent of the State population, fell from an annual average of
14.6 percent in 2006 to 8.7 percent in 2010, and maintained a downward trend in 2011 (Figure
2). The unemployment rate in the MAR shifted from 10.9 percent in August 2009 to 6.7
percent in the same month of 2011. Partly due to this, in addition to the role played by federal
poverty reduction programs, the percentage of the population living below the extreme
poverty line has decreased from 33 percent in 2003 to 17 percent in 2009.2

31.    Pernambuco faces the dual challenge of consolidating its recent growth pattern
and turning its capacity to turn higher growth rates into lower poverty and inequality.
In 2009, the share of the population below the poverty line was twice that of Brazil and above
the northeastern average (Figure 3). The levels of per capita GDP, poverty, and inequality in
Pernambuco reflect the large gaps between the northeast and the rest of Brazil. However,
within the northeast, Pernambuco is well positioned to catch up faster to the rest of Brazil in
terms of economic and social development.

Recent Evolution of Fiscal and Debt Indicators for the State of Pernambuco

32.     Pernambuco’s fiscal policy framework has been prudent. Over the past decade all
fiscal indicators improved, mainly due to an improvement of the efficiency of the State’s
fiscal administration, the stability of net personnel expenses, and the significant decline of net
consolidated debt.3 All indicators are currently well within the prudential limits set in the
Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). The State is in solid compliance with the prudential limits


3
  The improvement in fiscal administration efficiency was due mainly to the introduction to tax payer
substitution systems and the adoption of the electronic fiscal note.

                                                  11
set out in the LRF since 2004. This situation has allowed the State to drastically reduce net
consolidated debt (NCD), build up fiscal balance and increase slowly investment.

33.      On the revenue side, total revenues grew at an average of 10.8 percent in real
terms during 2004-2010, one of the highest rates among Brazilian states. This revenue
growth was due to the good performance of all main revenue categories: tax revenues,
transfers, social contributions and other revenues. The ICMS to the State Participation Fund
(FPE) ratio was 240 percent in 2010, the highest among the northeastern states, after a break
in the trend in 2008 (Table 2, Figure 4)

34.    On the debt front, Pernambuco’s situation is also solvent. Due to the
aforementioned growing fiscal revenues and consistent fiscal adjustment, the net consolidated
debt-to-revenue ratio fell steeply from over 104 percent of net consolidated debt (NCR) (See
Figure 5) in 2004 to 39 percent by 2010, well within the LRF limit of 200 percent. During

2004-2008, Pernambuco made large amounts of amortization. Debt service has been
decreasing since 2004 driven by lower interest payments and increasing NCR (Figure 5)

Medium-Term Fiscal and Debt Sustainability

35.     The fiscal perspective shows that the objective of supporting an ambitious
regional development agenda can be accompanied by borrowing. The projected fiscal and
debt paths for the State of Pernambuco are sustainable in the medium term. The baseline
scenario projections indicate a sustainable path, with positive primary fiscal balances.
Pernambuco’s fiscal balances (the primary fiscal balance, the overall balance, and the gross
operating balance) are all expected to record surpluses for the projected period, allowing for
fiscal space for State investments, while net consolidated debt is projected to fall from 39
percent of net current revenue in 2010 to 20.1 percent by 2020.

Social Development: Inequality, Race, Gender, and Spatial Distribution

36.    Inequality in Pernambuco is higher than in the rest of Brazil but lower than
other states of the northeast region. Inequality in Pernambuco overlays with
characteristics such as geographic location, gender, race and socioeconomic groupings.
These inequalities are tackled comprehensively as part of the proposed operation, by focusing
on the expansion of opportunities throughout the State and enhancing equity among regions
and socioeconomic groups.

37.     There is a dual dynamic of poverty reduction in Pernambuco. While poverty
decreased in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas of the State, the gap
between the interior of the State and the rest of the Brazilian non-metropolitan areas
widened, and the gap between the MAR and other metropolitan areas narrowed.4
(Figure 6). In 2009, over 60 percent of the population in the interior of the State had an
average income of less than half the minimum wage, while the proportion for the MAR was

below 40 percent. These poverty levels highlight the unequal conditions in the interior of the
State.

38.    Poverty in Pernambuco is correlated with people’s circumstances in terms of
location, race, and gender, especially in the interior of the State. The gap in average
income between white and non-white residents increased between 1995 and 2009.
Coverage of secondary education is worse in the interior of the State than in the MAR, and
non-whites are at even more disadvantage. While almost 70 percent of whites between 18-24
years old living in Recife were able to complete 11 years of schooling (secondary education)
in 2009, less than 30 percent of non-white living in the interior of the State did so.

39.     Disparities in social indicators are also linked to geography, gender, ethnicity and
sector of economic activity. Gaps across different groups in their rates of access to social
services are visible measurements of inequality. The Human Development Index (HDI)—
constructed using averages in income, school attendance, literacy and life expectancy—shows
large variations across the territory (Figure 7).

40.     Pernambuco has one of the lowest Human Opportunity Indexes (HOI) in Brazil,
particularly underperforming in terms of access to water.5 The HOI measures both the
level of basic opportunities and how equitably those opportunities are distributed; it indicates
how personal circumstances for which an individual cannot be held accountable, like
birthplace, gender, or socioeconomic background, affect a child’s probability of accessing
basic services. An HOI of 100 indicates a society that provides universal and equal access to a
given service. Pernambuco’s HOI for access to water is indicative of continued inequality in
access and coverage shortages (Figure 8). Without changes in current trends, it would take
Pernambuco more than a century to achieve equitable and universal water coverage (Figure
9).

Labor markets: Significant Decline in Unemployment but Unequal Regional Distribution
of Employment

41.    A faster pace of job creation will be a key determinant of Pernambuco’s
development as well as of its capacity to reduce inequality. Job creation was been slower
than the Brazilian average both in the MAR and the interior of the State during the past 15
years. More strikingly, during the 2005-2009 period the MAR saw the creation of over
100,000 new jobs (an 8 percent increase), while the countryside lost almost 200,000 (an 8
percent decrease). The proportion of non-registered workers in both areas declined between
1995 and 2009; however, the proportion of non-registered workers in the interior (still above
70 percent in 2009) reflects the greater challenge of informality in job markets in the interior.

42.     A tight labor market was the outcome of a period of faster growth. Open
unemployment in the MAR fell from 10.4 percent in 2006 to 6.9 percent in 2010
(measured in December of each year). Unemployment rates for women also declined but
were, on average, 53 percent higher than for men. During the period 2006-2010 the average
unemployment rate was 7.0 percent for men and 10.4 percent for women. Both rates of
unemployment were higher than the national average (5.5 percent and 8.6 percent,
respectively). Due to an educational and skills deficit in the labor force, there is a component
of structural unemployment in the metropolitan labor market. Informality declined from 64.6
percent in 2004 to 59.5 percent in 2010, leaving fewer people outside the social protection
net.

43.      A fast growing economy has resulted in a strong rate of formal job creation.
Workers with a labor contract expanded at the annual rate of 7.0 percent during the period
2005-2010, rates above those presented by Brazil as a whole (5.8 percent) and the northeast
(6.6 percent). This growth was led by job creation in civil construction (23.7 percent per
year), commerce (8.4 percent), services (8.0 percent) and manufacturing (6.3 percent). The
outstanding rate of job creation in civil construction reflects robust investment in
infrastructure, productive activities, and housing. Most of the formal employment,
nevertheless, has been generated in the services and public administration sectors that jointly
represented 55.8 percent of overall employment in 2010.

44.     A tight labor market is reflected in the growth of labor earnings. In the MAR, the
percentage variation in real labor earnings over the period 2006-2010 was 12.2 percent while
the average figure for all metropolitan areas reached 8.4 percent. Although average labor
earnings in the MAR are the lowest among the six metropolitan regions in which data is
collected, they nevertheless present the fastest growth.

45.     The regional distribution of employment is unequal, reflecting the spatial
concentration of economic activity in the MAR. Sixty-six percent of formal employment in
2010 was located in the MAR, which accounts for 42 percent of Pernambuco’s population and
65 percent of the State’s GDP. Thus, a distinctive feature of Pernambuco is a heavy
concentration of population, employment and output in the MAR. Further, there are sharp
differences among regions in terms of GDP per capita, among other indicators that point to
the level of economic and social development in the State.

Education Presents Important Challenges Despite Recent Improvements

46.     Education conditions have improved in Pernambuco, especially at the primary
level, but challenges remain at the upper secondary level, most notably in the interior of
the State. The share of 7 to 14 year-olds attending primary school increased significantly,
from 76 percent in 1995 to 95 percent in 2009 and is now comparable to the national average
(98 percent for Brazil), with disparities between the MAR and the interior of the State
virtually negligible for this particular indicator. However, student enrollment at the upper
secondary level for the 15 to 17 age group remains low despite recent growth: coverage
increased from a low 10 percent in 1995 to 33 percent in 2009 in the interior; and from 20
percent to just under 50 percent in the MAR.

47.      Pernambuco schools lag behind the rest of the country on most measures of
quality. Drop-out rates are 44 percent higher in primary school and 8 percent higher in upper
secondary school for Pernambuco than in the rest of Brazil.6 Likewise, age-grade distortion—
the proportion of children at least two years too old for their grade—is much higher in
Pernambuco than in the rest of Brazil at every level of education (Figure 10). State scores on
the Index of Basic Educational Development—which combines test scores and student
progression data—are in the bottom third of all states at each level of education (Figure 11).
Illiteracy among young adults (15 to 24 years of age) declined significantly, particularly in the
interior of the State.7 However, the share of 18 to 24 year-olds capable of completing
secondary education is still below 50 percent.

  In Brazil, basic education is divided into the early years of Ensino Fundamental (Grades 1-5), the later years of
Ensino Fundamental (Grades 6-9) and Ensino Medio (Years 1-3). These correspond to primary, lower
secondary, and upper secondary school.
7
  Illiteracy in the interior of the northeastern region is quite high, particularly among older age groups.

Water: a Key Sector in Reducing Poverty and Improving Equity in Pernambuco

48.      Pernambuco still faces challenges in providing efficient access to basic public
utilities. While some services are nearly universal, others, such as coverage for sewage
collection, remain very low in both the MAR and the interior of the State (Table 3). Sewage
service levels for urban areas in the interior are surprisingly better than those in the MAR:
sewage collection was higher in the interior urban areas (57.8 percent) than in the MAR in
2009 (39.6 percent). The same was true for water distribution and water collection, although
differences were less pronounced. In spite of high levels of coverage of the public water
supply network, the service is unreliable and intermittent. Low sanitation coverage impacts
not only the un-served population, presenting risks to public health, but also, indirectly, the
population served, as raw wastewater contributes to the pollution of water resources. Some of
the State’s most important water sources, located in the Capibaribe river basin and providing

                                                           18
water to about 2.6 million people, face increased pollution due to untreated domestic sewage.
Water scarcity, unreliable water supply, and insufficient sanitation services have a negative
impact on economic performance and social development in the State.


III. THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

A. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

49.      The centerpiece of the current Government’s program has been the All for
Pernambuco—Results-focused, Democratic and Regionalized Management strategy. In the
face of stark inequalities between interior and costal Pernambuco, black and white
populations, and women and men, the positive economic developments in the State have not
fully overcome the deficits that have kept social indicators in Pernambuco significantly below
national averages. Since assuming office in 2007, the Campos administration has centered its
priorities on promoting balanced development in Pernambuco. In particular, the
Government’s strategy seeks the integration of regions and populations isolated from the
positive transformations taking place in other areas of Pernambuco, notably the MAR. At the
same, the Government also seeks a reduction of inequality within the MAR.

50.     In the process of developing the All for Pernambuco program, the Government
has undertaken an extensive strategy to build more participatory planning and
monitoring mechanisms that would allow for more direct engagement of citizens,
institutionalizing spaces for dialogue and consultation with key stakeholders. The
administration shaped its agenda through public seminars conducted throughout all 12
development regions of the State. As such, the strategy has been largely developed from the
ground up, consolidating the commitment of key actors.

51.     With these inputs, the Government has operationalized the All for Pernambuco
strategy through a new Management Model, structured around results-based
management (Box 2). The Government’s actions have been structured around strategic
objectives that guide the planning and monitoring for results. This Strategy Map has then
served to align the actions of different agencies around a common vision. The agreement of
all secretariats to the Strategy Map has enabled the Government to focus its actions into two
priority areas—―Most Vulnerable Population Layers‖ and ―Interiorization of
Development,‖—which address disparities between the different population segments and
regions of the State. The Management Model has been led mainly by the Governor, with
support by SEPLAG.

52.    In 2010, the incumbent Governor was re-elected by an overwhelming majority8,
which was interpreted as a strong show of support for the Government Strategy.
Building upon its initial iteration during the first Campos administration, the All for
Pernambuco program was fine-tuned to consolidate the administrative structure and
government team. By the end of 2010, the Management Institute of Pernambuco (Instituto de
Gestão - PE) was created to promote the continuous production of and training in new
knowledge to strengthen public management.


8
    The governor of Pernambuco was re-elected with 82 percent of the vote.

                                                       19
                            Box 2: Pernambuco’s Management Model
 Law 141/2009 established Pernambuco’s Management Model – a systemic organization of the
 functions related to the state’s formal planning instruments (the Multiannual Planning or PPA, the
 Annual Budget Guidelines, and the Annual Budget Law) and management tools adopted by the
 state’s public administration.
 A participatory process defines the strategic priorities for a four-year period, which are formalized
 in the PPA document. These priorities feed into the budget formulation of individual institutions on
 an annual basis through the Annual Budget Guidelines.
 Budget formulation following centrally planned priorities is then reflected in budget allocations in
 the Annual Budget Law. During budget execution, the state monitors expenditures related to
 strategic priorities in real time to ensure expenditures are executed towards these objectives.
 Finally, the state’s performances to meet the targets by strategic priority are monitored on a
 quarterly basis through the Social Management Report, closing the Management Model cycle and
 feeding into discussions for revising the PPA.
 The law established a Core Management Group, reporting directly to the Governor’s Office, for the
 coordination of the Management Model.


53.     Similar to the process that began in 2007, the 2011–2014 Government
development plan has been developed through a participatory process. The consultation
process was carried out through the second round of regional seminars from February to May
2011, aimed at fostering thematic discussion between the population and the secretaries of the
main strategic areas, including Health, Education, Economic Development, Social
Development, Infrastructure, and Security. As part of the process, questionnaires were
distributed to gather suggestions from the population, with a high response rate among
participants.

54.    A comparison between the population’s participation rates in 2007 and 2010
demonstrated an increase in participation of 154 percent, reflected in all regions, as shown
in Figure 12.

55.    The Government’s Development Plan has identified three strategic areas of
intervention for the current period, namely:

          Improving the quality of life of Pernambucanos to ensure goods and quality
           services to all residents.

          Generating opportunities for productive inclusion and income distribution,
           expanding and improving the standards of productivity and competitiveness of
           Pernambuco’s economy.

          Enhancing the capacity of the State public administration to generate positive
           outcomes for society, with particular emphasis on Fiscal Responsibility and the
           Management Model.

56.    Interiorização (regional development strategy in the interior of the State) is a key
element of the link between growth and equity. By spreading the benefits of growth
throughout the State, the Government aims to address correlated dimensions of inequality,
such as gender, resulting in more inclusive development dynamics.

IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A. LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (CPS) FOR FY12-15

57.    Brazil’s priorities for its partnership with the World Bank Group are focused on
second-generation development problems that require innovative solutions, in terms of
improving national policy frameworks and finding new ways to implement programs
with sub-national governments and at the firm level. The proposed operation is fully
aligned with the principles of flexibility, selectivity, innovation, and leveraging chosen by the
Bank to deploy its resources in Brazil. Flexibility: Adjusting areas of engagement and
instruments to better respond to the country’s evolving needs. Selectivity: Focusing on areas
where Brazil faces second-generation development challenges and can benefit most from the
Bank’s knowledge and experience. Innovation: Supporting innovative investments and policy
reforms that can be replicated locally and internationally, and offering innovative services and
instruments (e.g. result-based and multi-sector loans, partial credit risk and other guarantees).
Leveraging: Increasing the use of leveraged resources from government, the private sector,
and other development partners, to maximize development impacts

58.     The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2015 (Report #
63731-BR), discussed by the Executive Directors on November 1, 2011, will help address
these challenges, and help achieve the overarching goal of higher rates of inclusive and
sustainable growth by focusing on four strategic objectives (See Figure 13): (i) increase
the efficiency of public and private investments; (ii) improve the quality and expand the
provision of public services for low income households; (iii) promote regional economic
development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure investments, and support for
the private sector in frontier areas; and (iv) further improve sustainable natural resource
management and enhance climatic resilience while contributing to local economic
development and helping to meet rising global food demand. Brazil is looking to the Bank as
a partner in the dissemination of country knowledge and development experiences to other
countries.

                                               21
59.     The proposed multi-sectoral operation directly responds to these four objectives
and as such reflects the alignment of government priorities with the strategies for World
Bank engagement. Given the low levels of income and capacity in the northeast, the CPS has
highlighted the importance of engagement in the region. More specifically, the CPS envisions
a notable participation of the Bank in Pernambuco, with a particular emphasis in supporting
policy reforms to promote regional and social inclusion.

B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

60.    As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not work directly with sub-
national governments, there has been no direct collaboration with the IMF on the
proposed DPL. This DPL does, however, comply with the guidelines for coordinating with
the IMF on development policy lending set forth in the Joint Management Action Plan
(JMAP) as relevant to national DPL collaboration.9

61.    The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is actively implementing four
investment loans within the State of Pernambuco: the development of the National
Tourism Program (PRODETUR) for the State of Pernambuco (US$75 million); the
Modernization and Transparency of Fiscal Management in the State of Pernambuco
(PROFISCO-Pernambuco) (US$15 million); Innovation and Dissemination Local Cluster
Competitiveness (US$10 million); and the northeast Brazil Small Business Fund (US$1.5
million). These four operations are complementary to the reform program supported by the

 Guidance on Coordinating with the IMF on Development Policy Lending (2010) and Enhancing Collaboration:
Joint Management Action Plan (Follow-Up to the Report of the External Review Committee on World Bank-
IMF Collaboration) (2007)

                                                  22
proposed DPL, demonstrating the commitment of resources to the implementation of the
policy reforms.

62.    The Andean Development Corporation (CAF) is a regional development bank
that has ongoing programs in Brazil. Their recent lending in Brazil has focused heavily on
supporting productive sectors, international trade, and infrastructure lending to both the public
and private sectors. In 2010, CAF approved a lending portfolio of US$1.226 million. Their
current lending portfolio does not include investments directly with the State of
Pernambuco.10

C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

63.     The proposed DPL complements on-going and previous Bank development policy
and investment operations in water and sanitation, education, economic growth, and
public sector governance. Currently, in the State of Pernambuco the Bank is engaged in two
active investment loans in the areas of water resource management, education, and public
sector management The proposed DPL includes policies directly linked to the institutional
frameworks to accompany these investment operations.

64.     Development Policy Loans complement investment loans by supporting policy
reforms that enhance the institutional context and enable higher investments to
reinforce their desired impact. Regulatory frameworks, government efficiency and
accountability, educational reforms, and policies to support the strengthening of backward and
forward linkages of private investment within the State, are important to guarantee the
sustainability and consistency of specific investments.

65.     The Pernambuco Sustainable Water Project is a World Bank investment loan
that seeks to improve sustainable water supply and sanitation services for the population
residing in the Capibaribe river basin. It complements and contributes to the
implementation of the Government of Pernambuco’s water sector program through
improvement of water sector management and institutions, and support for expansion
and increased efficiency in the provision of water supply and sanitation services. The
Adapting Water Resources Planning and Operation to Climate Changes in northeast Brazil
Analytical and Advisory Activity also directly addresses water provision in the region (not
only in Pernambuco). The proposed DPL advocates a strengthening of the institutional
framework to improve the management of water resources, and is thus closely linked to these
ongoing water projects. The proposed DPL further advances these current initiatives through
its focus on disaster risk management, particularly through policies to improve the hydro-
meteorological monitoring and early warning systems.

66.     The Pernambuco Education Results and Accountability SWAp (Sector Wide
Approach) is the second active Bank project being implemented directly in Pernambuco.
Its development objectives are to: (a) improve the quality, efficiency and equity of public
education in Pernambuco; and (b) introduce management reforms that will lead to greater
efficiency in the use of public resources by the Government of the State of Pernambuco in the
education sector. The proposed DPL complements this Bank investment by supporting
policies to improve the quality of education, particularly in the interior of the country.

The Bank has been engaged in a partnership with the State of Pernambuco since 1979. The
proposed DPL represents a complement to the recent and on-going Bank engagement in the
State of Pernambuco. It reflects a concerted strategy by the Bank to support key areas for
development in the State, namely quality of education, water sustainability and management,
and economic and social integration of the rural sector.

D. CHOICE OF INSTRUMENT AND RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK
   OPERATIONS

67.     Development Policy Lending versus Investment Lending. The DPL supports a
multi-sectoral approach directly linked to the strategic objectives outlined by the Pernambuco
Government in their Strategy Map. Given the State’s commitment to and ownership of its
development strategy, and its track record of reform, a DPL is an appropriate vehicle through
which to further advance the State’s developmental goals. The State’s reform program is
robust and embodies cross-cutting themes: (i) improving the quality of life of the citizens of
Pernambuco, by improving access to quality services and protecting the citizens and their
property from crime and climate-related hazards; (ii) changing the pattern of growth (the so-
called New Economy) by strengthening the linkages between the most dynamic sectors and
the rest of the State’s economy; and, iii) establishing the conditions for better government,
increasing the capacity and efficiency of public administration to generate concrete results for
the citizens of Pernambuco. The Government’s program and priorities provide a solid ground
for confidence that the operation will contribute to poverty reduction.

68.     Development policy lending, as mentioned above, complements investment
lending by supporting policy reforms that enhance the institutional context and enable
higher investments to reinforce their impact (see Figure 14). Thus far, IBRD support to the
State of Pernambuco has been primarily in the form of investment loans in rural poverty
reduction, water, and education.11 In the rural poverty sector, the Bank has been engaged in a
partnership with the State Government since 1979. The latest project (Pernambuco Rural
Economic Inclusion) is scheduled for Board approval in March 2012. In the education sector,
the Bank has been engaged in two projects, the first one (Pernambuco Integrated
Development: Education Quality Improvement) closed in June 2010 while the latest, a SWAp
(Pernambuco Education Results and Accountability) is currently active, closing in December
2013. It aims to: (i) improve the quality, efficiency and equity of public education in
Pernambuco; and (ii) introduce management reforms to increase efficiency in the use of the
State’s public resources in the education sector. In the water sector, the Bank is supporting the
Pernambuco Sustainable Water Project, which is currently active and closing in November
2015. As such, a development policy lending would be complementary to previous and
ongoing IBRD support by strengthening the institutional and policy environment to make
investment lending more effective.

69.     One-tranche DPL versus two-tranche DPL. A single-tranche DPL was preferred for
two reasons. First, the long partnership between the Bank and the State of Pernambuco (Box
3) demonstrated a track record of successful development cooperation in the State. Second,
the relatively higher capacity of the Government of Pernambuco compared to other states of
the northeast and its strong commitment to increasing the capacity and efficiency of public
administration confirm the advisability of a single-tranche loan.

70.     The State operation is linked with two ongoing investment loans in education and
water. In particular, the Bank has had a long partnership with the State Government in the
areas of rural development, water management, urban upgrading, and education. Those
projects are relevant to the design of the proposed DPL. First, they are supporting the
Government in the same areas; as such complementarity and continuity were key to the
design of the new operation. The engagement of experienced teams encouraged better
information flow, coordination with the Government, and operation design.

E. LESSONS LEARNED

71.   The proposed operation seeks also to support the advances being made in the
areas of economic development, public sector management and gender to facilitate

12
   In January 2012, the Bank approved a third complementary instrument, the Program-for-Results (P4R). P4R
would be the instrument of choice when the objective is to support the performance of a government program
using the government’s own systems, when the results require expenditures, and when the risks to achieving the
program’s objectives relate to the capacity of the systems to achieve better results, including with respect to
fiduciary and environmental and social issues.

                                                      26
deeper development change for all Pernambucanos. The World Bank currently is engaged
in two investment operations in Pernambuco in the sectors of education and water resource
management. The proposed operation complements the on-going engagements in the State of
Pernambuco and seeks to further these lines of work, while promoting new areas for
engagement.

72.     The Bank is well placed to support the State of Pernambuco in its efforts towards
more equity, efficiency and governance. As a sub-national DPL, the operation is similar in
nature to other Bank operations with Brazilian state governments. The relevant projects are
Alagôas (Fiscal and Public Sector Reform, 2009), Rio Grande do Sul (Fiscal Sustainability for
Growth, 2008), Minas Gerais (Partnership for Development, 2006). Rio Municipality (Fiscal
Consolidation for Efficiency and Growth, 2010), Rio State (Fiscal Efficiency,
Competitiveness, and Human Development, 2010 and Urban 2011). These experiences with
sub-national governments have provided strong foundations for this operation in two ways.
First, the preparation and supervision of the five operations gave the Bank substantial
experience as to the nature of sub-national fiscal and public-sector management. The Rio
State: Fiscal Consolidation, Human Development and Competitiveness DPL and the Rio
Municipality Fiscal Consolidation for Efficiency and Growth DPL have allowed the Bank to
support the alignment of health and education policies at different levels of government,
namely state and municipalities. Second, as part of project preparation and supervision, the
Bank has been fostering increased dialogue on technical issues among civil servants of these
sub-national governments on debt management, project monitoring, and public investment
management.

73.    The operation has been prepared with careful consideration of key lessons in Bank
experience in the development of DPLs:

   a. The policy actions should reflect the Borrower’s reform agenda. The operation nearly
      mirrors the Strategy Map recently approved by the Governor of Pernambuco. As
      such, the policies proposed are in line with and advance the Government’s program of
      policy reform.

   b. Participation promotes accountability. The current administration of Pernambuco has
      engaged in an extensive consultation process with citizens throughout the State to
      define the Government agenda. In doing so, it has facilitated widespread commitment
      and encouraged accountability within the Government for its policy actions.

   c. The operation should highlight areas for continued dialogue with the client. The
      proposed loan builds upon priority areas of engagement between the World Bank and
      the Borrower, as defined by the CPS as well as the current operational portfolio. In
      addition, it opens the door for future areas of engagement in key development sectors
      for the State, such as gender, public sector management, and economic development.

   d. Monitoring and evaluation—specificity and “monitorability? of indicators. The policy
      matrix employs outcome indicators that are realistic, quantifiable (with targets to be
      determined by baselines), and opportune in terms of the availability of information
      within the timeline defined by the program. In doing so, the matrix is able to look not
      only to actions, but also to their intended results.


                                             27
   e. Coordination with the federal Government. The experience of other DPLs
      demonstrates the importance of acting in a coordinated fashion with respect to
      different levels of the administration.

F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

74.     The proposed Expanding Opportunity, Enhancing Equity in Pernambuco
Development Policy Lending builds on the analytical underpinnings established in the
literature on the links between equity and development (World Bank, 2006;
Bourguignon, et al., 2007), and the empirical findings in Molinas-Vega, et al. (2010). This
research shows that the disparity of initial conditions for individuals, which tend to be linked
to socioeconomic background and other group-specific circumstances, are a key determinant
of future income. The absence of interventions to ―level the playing field‖, or equalize the
initial conditions for all, can reinforce intergenerational poverty traps and perpetuate
inequality.

75.     Economic growth is a precondition for sustained expansion of opportunities.
More equitable access to basic goods and services, such as health and education, in turn
improves overall productivity and fosters further growth. Active policies, as well as the
political conditions for their sustainability, are required to trigger such virtuous circles
between equity, growth and reductions in inequality (Bourguignon, et al. 1997; Levy and
Walton, 2008).

76.     Existing research shows that following the recent expansion of the economy in
Pernambuco, bottlenecks must be removed to make the growth pattern sustainable in
the long run and to strengthen its regional and sectoral linkages. Growth has not resulted
in proportionally more balanced distribution of opportunities in the state. Molinas-Vega, et al.
(2010) estimate indicators of access to services for different groups, corrected for differences
by socioeconomic circumstances, and find that Pernambuco is among the most unequal
states, in an already unequal country. The Human Opportunity Index (HOI), which
measures both the level of essential services and how equitably those services are distributed,
shows an improvement between 2005 and 2008 for services such as water and sanitation, and
schooling, but at a slow pace. Moreover, when the indicator is used to measure the advance in
school performance, using national tests in mathematics and language, the results are poorer,
and in some cases there is a decrease in average performance for the state. The indicators to
monitor the proposed DPL include targets for the HOI for specific services, as an index of
advancement in equity in access to quality services.

77.     Improving equity in the access to socioeconomic opportunities will help the State
to take advantage of otherwise hidden margins of productivity. In turn, increased equity
results in a higher potential growth pattern in the long run. Moreover, enhancing equity
improves conditions for social cohesion and may have an impact on other social outcomes,
such as reductions in crime and violence, thereby improving the investment climate and
further feeding back into growth (Fajnzylber et al., 2002). Thus, two components of a
comprehensive strategy for long-run sustained economic development are intrinsic to the
framework of the proposed DPL: namely the expansion of opportunities and the enhancement
of equity.



                                              28
78.     Existing experience in Water Resource Management (WRM) indicates the
importance of monitoring downstream impacts. To date, WRM programs have focused on
upstream micro-level activities and institutions. Adequate WRM requires a more
comprehensive and participatory process of planning, robust institutional arrangements, and a
broader range of planning tools, incorporating land use and water resources together with
other aspects of spatial planning. At the same time, WRM programs need to develop adequate
tools and mechanisms to reconcile cross-sectoral water demands, focus on longer-term
objectives, and implement an integrated approach at the basin and urban levels. Persistence,
patience, and flexible adaptation to local circumstances are needed to implement such
integrated approaches. Institutional stability is key for long-term policy development and
implementation. Institutional, environmental, and service improvement objectives associated
with integrated WRM should be treated as long-term program goals.

79.     The use of economic instruments in WRM requires a measured and realistic
approach. To date, advances in the use of economic instruments in WRM have been limited
in Brazil. The few successful initiatives in implementing bulk water charges followed a
gradual and pragmatic approach where charges were set at values negotiated with key water
users (particularly water supply and sanitation). Efforts to develop water rights systems need
to be selective and consistent with the institutional capacity to enforce such rights. Once
demonstrable results become available in more critical basins, water authorities may build
support for scaling up and for institutional strengthening.

80.     The design of the proposed operation is backed by extensive analytical work in
the field of disaster risk reduction conducted by the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery, the World Bank, the IDB, and specialized United Nations
agencies. This work has provided the basis for the dialogue with the Government of
Pernambuco during the design of this DPL. The ability to manage disaster risk (rather than
treating a disaster as an exogenous shock to development that cannot be proactively
addressed) has been documented in a wide array of studies and is the underpinning of the
Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). Pernambuco has acknowledged that managing disaster
risk is good practice for sustainable development. In addition to the HFA, this operation is
built on the findings from a number of key documents and publications:

  i.   Natural Disaster Hotspots, A Global Risk Analysis (World Bank 2005). This is a
       comprehensive analysis of countries’ risk exposure to hydro-meteorological and
       geotectonic hazards. The study found that Brazil is among the countries that are most
       at risk of droughts, floods, and landslide hazards, based on land area, percentage of
       total population, and GDP exposed.

 ii.   The Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (United Nations 2011).
       This assessment is a comprehensive review and analysis of natural hazards threatening
       humankind. It also critically examines Disaster Risk Management instruments where
       significant barriers still exist, such as land use planning, building codes and ecosystem
       management, and where new approaches need to be adopted. The study concluded that
       disaster risk is increasing faster in low- and lower-middle-income countries with
       rapidly growing economies, and that countries with small and vulnerable economies
       are less resilient. While Brazil is considered an upper-middle-income country, in the
       recent past its economy has been affected by external shocks, including those caused
       by natural hazards.

                                              29
 iii.   Natural Hazards, UnNatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective Prevention
        (World Bank and United Nations 2011). This report focuses on the economics of
        reducing the vulnerability to natural disasters, and presents examples from around the
        world that demonstrate that government investments in ex-ante measures, instead of
        solely in emergency response and recovery actions, can be more cost-effective.

V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION: EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES, ENHANCING
   EQUITY IN THE STATE OF PERNAMBUCO

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

81.     The program development objective of the proposed operation is to strengthen
public policies that expand economic opportunities and enhance equity of access to
quality services for the people of Pernambuco. Consistent with the State’s development
plan, the areas of support can be summarized in the matrix below (Table 4). In particular, the
proposed DPL supports the State’s strategy aimed at: (i) improving the quality of life of the
people of Pernambuco; (ii) establishing the conditions for a new, more inclusive economic
growth pattern; and, (iii) developing a culture of efficient government for results. These
policy areas are described in detail in the next section with the complete policy matrix
presented in Annex 2. The Program has been defined in close collaboration with the State
Government, based on a shared assessment of the importance and relevance of the policies to
the development objectives, the feasibility of their implementation, and the comparative
advantage of the Bank to the policy reforms.

82.    The definition of the prior actions has been guided by the recommendations
provide through the ―Good Practice Note for Development Policy Lending‖ (World
Bank, 2011). In particular, the preparation and dialogue around the proposed operation has
followed the principles outlined in the Box 4 below.

                       Box 4: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

 Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
      Operation follows in line with the strategic priorities defined under the Government’s 2011-2015
         Strategy Map
      The Strategy Map is the result of an extensive participatory process of dialogue with citizens,
         government (secretariats in particular), and other key actors
      There appears to be broad-based support for the Government’s reform agenda as evidenced by the re-
         election of the incumbent with an overwhelming majority

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
 accountability framework
      Identification of very specific and measurable indicators
      Operation complements projects of other donors, particularly the IDB

 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
 circumstances
      First operation planned as a DPL to respond to immediate priority fiscal issues, with the intention to
         provide follow-on support through investment loans and other modalities of Bank assistance
      Operation addresses both the access and targeting issues expressed in the Government’s agenda of
         interiorização
      Monitoring framework facilitated by existing monitoring mechanisms of the government

 Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
      Focus on critical areas of the Government’s agenda that have a direct impact on development and
         wellbeing of its citizens
      Focus on strategic areas of existing or potential World Bank engagement where the Bank has a
         comparative advantage

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
 financial support
      Policy actions will be closely monitored through the regular monthly meetings on the progress of
          strategic priorities, chaired by the Governor
      Monthly meetings will be focused specifically on the progress towards the expected results of
          strategic priorities


B. POLICY AREAS

83.    The proposed operation will support critical reforms towards more inclusive
development and growth under three broad policy areas: (i) improving the quality of life
for Pernambucanos by contributing to improvements in the quality of education, particularly
at the secondary level, increased water security and reliability of water supply, and
improvements in disaster and risk management; (ii) expanding economic and social
opportunities for Pernambucanos through the development of human capital for the local job
market, greater gender equity, and support for the integration of micro, small and medium-
size enterprises and rural producers into local supply chains; and (iii) increasing public
administration capacity for generating results by improving tax administration, planning and
budgeting, and the institutionalization of the State’s Management Model.

Policy Area 1: Improving the Quality of Life for Pernambucanos

Policy Objective 1.1: Provide Quality Education

Policy Action 1
The Borrower has created conditions conducive to improving the quality of education, including an
increase in the hours of instruction, as evidenced by:
       (a)      Gubernatorial Decree No. 36.120 of January 21, 2011, authorizing full-day instruction
                (40 hours per week) in six (6) additional secondary schools, for an aggregate total of
                65 secondary schools; and
       (b)      Gubernatorial Decree No. 36.119 of January 21, 2011, authorizing expanded hours of
                instruction (32 hours per week) in fourteen (14) additional secondary schools, for an
                aggregate total of 108 secondary schools.


84.     Description and Challenges: The State of Pernambuco has shown marked
education improvements over time, despite lagging behind the rest of Brazil in education
coverage and quality. Upper secondary school enrollments are low, dropout rates are high,
and test scores consistently place Pernambuco in the bottom third of Brazilian states. Despite
these challenges, the State of Pernambuco has made significant progress over the last decade.
Coverage for children age 7 to 14 has reached the national average over the last decade, and
coverage for children age 15 to 17 has expanded from 70 percent to 78 percent. Even in the
face of expanding coverage (which usually means inclusion of children with fewer resources
and higher likelihood of dropping out), dropout rates have dropped dramatically (Table 6). In
lower secondary school, dropout rates have dropped significantly, although in upper
secondary school they have remained roughly constant. Age-grade distortion rates have
dropped from 66 percent to 49 percent at the upper secondary level, similarly reflecting
improvements across age levels. Student performance has also risen over time, with upper
secondary IDEB (Brazilian Index of Educational Development) scores rising from 2.7 to 3.3
between 2005 (the first year of the IDEB) and 2009 (with even greater gains in earlier years of
education).

85.     The Government is taking action to improve the quality of teaching at all levels of
education (Box 5). The State of Pernambuco has implemented a range of programs in recent
years to improve its student learning outcomes. The State has defined basic standards in order
to make sure that—over time—every State school has sufficient infrastructure, equipment,
teaching materials, and teachers so as to provide quality education. Further, the State has
implemented accelerated learning programs for literate students at each level of education in
order to reduce age-grade distortion and keep children engaged in school for as long as

                                                         36
possible. In 2008, the State introduced its own annual student assessment program (Sistema de
Avaliacão Educacional de Pernambuco, or SAEPE) in order to monitor student performance
at more levels of education than the federal student assessment permits. The State has also
implemented a reform to improve school management through competitive selection and
intensive training of school directors. Finally, the State implemented a reform to provide
schools and teachers with bonuses directly related to student performance. This reform is
being rigorously evaluated in partnership with the Bank and the evaluation will inform further
design adjustments.

86.     In this context, a revision of the full-day upper secondary school education
curriculum will further the enhancement of the quality of learning for students.
Although expansion of full-day coverage under the current curriculum is expected to improve
student results, the federal Government recently issued a set of directives to guide full-day
schooling, and the State is undergoing a curricular revision to bring its curriculum into line
with these directives. In addition, the State is taking advantage of new knowledge, such as
that created by a program of systematic classroom observation recently carried out by the
State in partnership with the World Bank, in order to identify specific areas to improve the
quality of education. These observations form the basis for future interventions, and the goal
of the revised curriculum is to improve the quality of teaching in extended day classrooms.

87.     The DPL will support as a prior action the increased hours of instruction as part
of Pernambuco’s broader efforts to improve the quality of education, particularly
outside the MAR, so as to promote equity of education. As mentioned above, Pernambuco
has undertaken a broad series of reforms to improve the quality of its educational system,
from the revision of its curriculum, to the development of the State’s own assessment system,
to performance-based bonuses to teachers. In the same vein, the State has initiated another
key reform for quality education through the expansion of school hours. Extensive research
has demonstrated the importance of sufficient academic learning time and the effective use of
that time for improving student performance (Cotton, 1989; Bellei, 2009) (see Box 5). To
date, the expansion has taken place in 173 schools (108 with the 32-hour week and 65 with
the 40-hour week), currently reaching 67,000 students.

88.     More than three-quarters of the schools to be incorporated are outside the MAR,
enhancing the equity dimensions of the policy. The DPL specifically supports the recent
gubernatorial decrees authorizing the expansion of six additional schools into the jornada
integral, and 14 schools into the jornada semi-integral program, as part of an ongoing
expansion across the State. The indicators are intended to demonstrate the expected progress
to be made under the policy reform in the coming year, with an emphasis on reaching schools
in the interior of the State. The State plans to achieve universal coverage of full-day upper
secondary schooling in 2014.

 Box 5: Bank Engagement in Education in Pernambuco and Implications For Extended
                                  School Hours
    A. Operational and Analytical Complementarities in Education
Over the last several years, the World Bank and the State of Pernambuco have capitalized on their
complementarities in operational and analytical work. The State Government and the World Bank
have collaborated on an evaluation of Pernambuco’s teacher pay-for-performance program, which has
demonstrated significant learning gains. This is the first major evaluation of teacher pay-for-
performance in Brazil, despite many states implementing such programs. The evaluation has
demonstrated both the positive impact of the program overall and that schools with more ambitious
targets achieved more progress. The Bank and the State have collaborated on two rounds of detailed
classroom observations to identify the difference in practices between teachers in the highest
performing schools and the lowest performing schools. These data have proven so useful that the
State has opted to invest in a third round using its own resources.

    B. The Effect of Extended School Hours on Outcomes
Expanding the hours of schooling creates potential conditions to improve the quality of learning. In
addition, the expansion of the school day in other countries demonstrates positive impacts not only on
student performance but also on social outcomes (leading to lower crime and lower adolescent
motherhood) (Pires and Urzua, 2010; Krueger and Betherlon, 2011). In Pernambuco, the State has
commenced an expansion of the school day at the upper secondary level in order to provide both more
time for learning, as well as more time for extra-curricular activities. The expansion lengthens the
school day from four hours to eight hours. In some schools, the expansion takes places all five school
days (achieving 40 hours of schooling) – jornada integral. In other schools, the expansion takes place
on three school days (achieving 32 hours of schooling)—jornada semi-integral.

Early evidence from Pernambuco itself suggests that these schools are delivering among the best test
score results in the State. In 2010 standardized tests for mathematics and Portuguese, schools with 40
hours per week delivered scores 58 percent higher than regular schools (with only 20 hours of
schooling per week), and schools with 32 hours per week delivered scores 27 percent higher than
regular schools.


Policy Objective 1.2: Improve Water Security and Increase Reliability of Water Supply

Policy Action 2
The Borrower has strengthened its management of water resources through the appointment of
permanent technical personnel for APAC in accordance with competitive procedures, as evidenced by
Gubernatorial Act No. 4570 of May 10, 2011 and Joint Resolution (Portaria Conjunta) SAD/APAC
No. 117 of December 14, 2010, all in accordance with the APAC Law and the APAC Resolutions.


89.     As shown previously (Figure 9), water provision in Pernambuco performs poorly
on composite measures of coverage and equity, such as the Human Opportunity Index.
If the trend in terms of coverage is maintained, it would take more a century to achieve
equitable universal provision of water in the State. The poor are disproportionately affected
by water scarcity, as the cost and access to alternative sources of water demand a relatively
higher portion of resources of the poor. As such, any agenda devoted to enhance quality of
life and equity in the State must include water-related policies.


                                                 38
90.    Pernambuco is one of the driest states in Brazil with per capita water availability
of 1,320 m3 per year on average, equivalent to only 3.5 percent of the national average
per capita availability. The State’s semi-arid Sertão and Agreste sub-regions represent 89
percent of the State’s territory and have only about 20 percent of the available water, with per
capita availability ranging from 400 m³ per year to 800 m³/year, respectively. The coastal
wetter sub-regions of Mata Pernambucana and the MAR concentrate 57 percent of the
population, mainly in the MAR (43 percent of the population and 65 percent of GDP) and
about 80 percent of the available water.

91.      The low water availability in the semi-arid regions of the State, coupled with the
high rate of urbanization and economic activity in the coastal regions place the State’s
available water resources under a great deal of stress. In spite of high levels of coverage of
urban households connected to the public water supply network, the service is unreliable and
intermittent. Of the 172 municipalities that are served by the Pernambuco State Water Supply
and Sanitation Company (COMPESA), only 30 receive water 24 hours per day. Rationing is
commonplace even in the MAR. Water losses were estimated to be around 56 percent, which
is significantly above the 38 percent national average. To reduce rationing and increase water
reliability, the State of Pernambuco, with support from the World Bank, is implementing large
investment programs to increase water production in the MAR and to manage and control
water losses.

92.      Strategic confined aquifers are being overexploited at alarming rates in the
MAR. The unreliability of the water services supplied by COMPESA in the MAR has
had serious impacts on groundwater resources, as large users seek alternatives by self-
provisioning from aquifers. The State Secretariat for Water Resources and Energy has
introduced zoning criteria to guide the licensing of new wells and the issuance of groundwater
rights; however, the unsustainable use of groundwater has persisted due to the limited
institutional capacity for enforcement. The increase of water supply and improvement in
service delivery generated by the ongoing investment programs are expected to reduce
pressure on the aquifers and allow their preservation as a strategic resource.

93.     Although the legal framework for water resources management in Pernambuco
includes all basic principles of modern water management, implementation of the State
water resources management (WRM) policy has been hindered by the lack of adequate
information and institutional capacity. Frequent administrative changes at the state level
with regards to the management of water resources have contributed to the vulnerability of
sector institutions and prevented the formation of an entity at the state level with adequate
resources and staff to carry out integrated planning and management of water resources. This
situation has changed recently with the establishment, consolidation and strengthening of the
State Water and Climate Agency (APAC). APAC serves as a regulatory agency, responsible
for water resource planning and management in the State, including the issuance of water
rights and bulk water charges as well as the State’s water and climate monitoring network.

94.     Given the negative impact water scarcity and unreliable water supply and
sanitation services have on the economic performance and social development in the
State, the Government of Pernambuco has selected the water resource management as a
priority sector and an important element of its State Development Plan. To this effect,
the Government of Pernambuco developed a strategy for the sector with the following
ambitious objectives:

                                              39
    (i) Reach universal access to water supply and sanitation in urban areas by the years 2014
        and 2018, respectively.
    (ii) Improve the State’s water resources development and management policies and
         practices in order to allow for the expansion of access to safe and reliable water for
         human consumption and productive use.

95.     Improved water resources management policies and practices are crucial to allow
access to safe and reliable water for human consumption and productive uses in the
State of Pernambuco, contributing to long-term sustainable growth, greater equity, and
protection of the most vulnerable populations. The enactment of measures to ensure proper
water resources management through appropriate, capable, and stable institutions is key to
addressing core development challenges. The establishment of the State of Pernambuco Water
and Climate Agency (APAC) represents the commitment of the State Government to
addressing the main challenges faced by the water sector. The enactment, staffing, and
strengthening of APAC provides the necessary environment to ensure the proper
implementation of the government policy and institutional framework in Integrated Water
Resources.

96.      Government Actions Supported by the Proposed DPL: The DPL will support as a
prior action the strengthening of the management of water resources through the
institutional strengthening of the State Water and Climate Agency (APAC). The
Government of Pernambuco is starting to implement a comprehensive water sector program
that improves water management to ensure reliable and safer water for human and productive
uses. APAC was created in March 2010 to take charge of water resources planning and
management. APAC will enable a consolidation and strengthening of the State’s institutional
framework to adequately manage water resources, including adequate organization, planning
and management tools. The agency has the mandate to monitor the hydraulic balance in the
State, triggering alerts for potential imbalances that could predict floods and droughts.
Moreover, the agency is in charge of fostering participatory management activities, such as
the establishment of new river basin committees and strengthening of existing ones, as well as
the establishment of water supply infrastructure users’ associations and councils. These
committees are representative of the communities, including their gender makeup, thereby
reflecting the needs and demands of the users. The framework put in place also calls for: the
revision, preparation, publication and dissemination of plans on water resources and selected
river basins; the preparation of technical studies for the efficient and sustainable use of
groundwater, with a special focus on the MAR and its complex groundwater dynamics;
improved water use regulation; and modernization and expansion of the hydro-meteorological
and water quality monitoring network, with a focus on disaster risk management of the most
critical river basins and aquifers.

Policy Objective 1.3: Improve Disaster and Risk Management

Policy Action 3

The Borrower has improved the management of disaster risks through the issuance of APAC’s Board
Resolution No. 001-2011 dated August 22, 2011, defining activities related to forecast and early
warning of disasters linked to hydro-meteorological events in the Borrower’s territory, and identifying
such activities jointly as activities of a situation room, as said activities have been integrated into the
Hydrological Critical Events Forecast System of the Guarantor’s Federal Government.

                                                    40
97.     Description and Challenges: Occupation of the semi-arid region and
urbanization in the coastal area has made the State especially vulnerable to both long
droughts and high rainfall events. Poor residents, who often live in rural areas and small
towns in the semi-arid region and informal settlements located in flood plains, typically suffer
the largest impacts from these events. Damages and losses from droughts and floods are not
assessed on a systematic basis, particularly for localized events that affect small communities.
The impact of these events is often concentrated in the poorest neighborhoods, where the
value of assets is limited, but the impact on affected households is significant. In Pernambuco,
floods and landslides are responsible for about 69 percent of registered disasters. The State
Conference on Civil Defense, in 2010, involving representatives of about 130 municipalities,
warned society of the existing risks and prepared the State to mitigate the negative effects of
the extreme rainfall and floods of June 2010. As a result of the extreme event that affected
several municipalities in the southern part of the coastal area, the State decided to improve its
disaster risk management system, with a focus on monitoring and early warning, response,
reconstruction, and improved knowledge about climate related hydrologic events.

98.    Preventing and mitigating the effects of water-related disasters can positively
impact equity, due to the correlation between disaster exposure and poverty. Both
regions that are more exposed to risk, as well as those areas that are more vulnerable within
the sub-regions, concentrate the most disadvantaged socioeconomic groups.

99.     The establishment of the Crisis Cabinet to coordinate the reconstruction and the
installation of local offices in the critical municipalities were key elements of the
response to the crisis and preparation for the reconstruction. During the crisis of June
2010, the State launched the Reconstruction Operation, based on legal actions (emergency
decrees), allocation of budget, a special fund, and an institutional structure comprising a
Management Committee and 12 local offices (with 170 staff from 11 State secretariats)
dedicated to response and reconstruction coordination. This operation has also produced an
integrated action plan. In the course of responding to the event, the State of Pernambuco
extracted lessons for improving its disaster management system, through better coordination,
climate and rivers monitoring, and early warning systems. The de facto protocol for response,
which is led by civil protection and involves action by several government entities, was
formalized through a decree that established clear lines responsibilities. Other actions,
including the expansion of flood vulnerability hydrologic modeling and mapping, are still to
be developed.

100. During the past year, the State of Pernambuco has taken a proactive approach to
mitigating the risks of losses due to disasters from extreme weather events. The civil
protection and reconstruction programs launched in 2010 can be considered a best practice
example of bringing together technical experts and government officials to mitigate risk. The
program has produced an early warning system based on hydro-meteorological network
placed in critical river basins, initiated the mapping of vulnerable areas to floods risk,
prioritized areas of intervention, and raised the awareness of vulnerable communities to the
risks they face. However, because informal settlements have continued to grow, a significant
gap remains. Adaptation against flooding, particular in high-risk coastal areas, still needs to
be developed. In the same way, adaptation against severe, longer droughts is to be improved,
particularly for the semi-arid areas in the west of the State.



                                               41
101. The Government’s Water Program also includes measures to protect citizens and
producers, particularly those at high risk, from water-related extreme climate events.
The high risk for water-related calamities in Pernambuco may increase as a result of climate
change and increased hydrologic variability. Adequate hydro-meteorological monitoring,
modeling and mapping, particularly for floods, and the implementation of an effective early
warning system are key elements of disaster risk management. These activities are part of the
adaptive measures that can reduce economic and social losses, and benefit the most
vulnerable population by reducing their exposure to risks. In addition to its regulatory
function for water resource management, APAC is also responsible for the monitoring of the
hydraulic balance in the State, triggering alerts for potential imbalances that could predict
floods and droughts.

102. Government Actions Supported by the Proposed DPL: The DPL will support as a
prior action the framework necessary for improved disaster risk management through
APAC. APAC will receive technical assistance from the National Water Agency for its
monitoring and early warning system. APAC will contribute to reinforcing activities related to
forecast and early warning of extreme hydro-meteorological events in the State of
Pernambuco. This includes identifying activities such as the establishment of a situation
room, integrated into the Hydrological Critical Events Forecast System of the federal
Government.

Policy Area 2: New Economy—Expanding Opportunities for Pernambucanos

Policy Objective 2.1: Promote Job Creation through the Development of Human Capital

Policy Action 4:
The Borrower has improved and developed human capital for the job market with emphasis on
professional education through the transformation of six (6) State schools into schools of professional
education, as evidenced by Gubernatorial Decrees No. 36.355 of March 29, 2011 and No. 36.121 of
January 21, 2011.


103. Description and Challenges: Technical education is essential to keeping students
in secondary school and is an integrated part of the State of Pernambuco Education and
Job Creation Strategy. It is also key to leveraging equity in education, by expanding the
training options for all students, and facilitating their labor market entry. The one level of
education that has shown little improvement in drop-out rates is upper secondary, and both
federal and State officials see a great need to offer vocational training opportunities for
students reaching that level of schooling to ensure that they perceive the relevance of
schooling and enter the job market with marketable skills. At the federal level, the current
presidential administration has introduced the Expansion Plan for Technical and Vocational
Education, which is building new technical institutes and providing full-day secondary
schooling that integrates traditional and vocational education.

104. The State Government of Pernambuco has undertaken a major expansion of
vocational education. In 2005, there were just 1,774 students enrolled in six State vocational
education institutions. By 2011, vocational enrollments had grown to 12,000 students in 14
institutions. This includes the establishment of integrated vocational and regular education in
some schools to help students to both continue traditional study (leaving higher education

                                                  42
options available) while learning more immediately marketable technical skills. Market
studies have been conducted to determine the training and skill sets needed by the local
market, including the private sector. This experience builds on successful experiences and
lessons learned in other countries, and emphasize private sector engagement. Technical
programs have been developed based on studies, including evidence from Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, and Peru, which demonstrate that vocational training programs can have
positive returns on wages.14 There is also evidence that vocational options within a secondary
school can keep students in school and lead to the improvement of core skills, such as literacy
and numeracy.15 A close link to the private sector seems to be key to success. The
Pernambuco program builds on this evidence, using studies of private sector demand in
planning vocational offerings in each region of the State.

105. The expansion of educational options, as well as extension of school hours, may
also have an impact on other social indicators. As the literature (including evidence from
Chile) shows, relevant social indicators related to poverty traps and cohesion, such as the
incidence of teenage pregnancy and violent crime, are negatively correlated with teenage
school attendance (Krueger and Berthelon, 2011). Vocational school options are expected to
help keep students in school. Thus, the educational policies described above are expected to
have other positive social externalities beyond immediate educational improvements.

106. Government Actions Supported by the Proposed DPL: The DPL will support the
transformation of six State schools into schools of professional education. These schools will
focus specifically on the development of technical skills based on local market demands in
order to increase the likelihood of translating training into local jobs. In the next two years,
the State will establish the Pernambuco Network for Secondary School Professional Training
and Competency. This network will establish uniform curriculum and quality standards for
professional school offerings in the State, municipal, and private sector professional schools.
It will include representatives from each sector and from each region of the State to ensure
that courses represent local needs. The planned expansion will pay particular attention to
more deprived areas in the interior of the State. The establishment of a State network to
improve the quality of professional training across not only state schools but also municipal
and private districts will improve quality even as the state expands coverage.

Policy Objective 2.2: Increase Opportunities through Greater Gender Equality

Policy Action 5

The Borrower has strengthened its institutional framework aimed at promoting gender equality
through the creation of a permanent Women’s Secretariat (Secretaria da Mulher) to replace the former
temporary special Women’s Secretariat, and the approval of regulations for said secretariat, as
evidenced by the Borrower’s Law No. 14.264 of January 6, 2011 and Gubernatorial Decree No.
36.659 of June 14, 2011, respectively.

107. Description and Challenges: Gender disparities continue to impede the social and
economic opportunities of women in Pernambuco. Despite the decline in overall poverty in
the State in recent years, the gap between male and female heads of household continues to
loom large at 9.4 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively. Levels of unemployment are also
higher for females in Pernambuco, with 17 percent of female heads of household unemployed
in 2009. The unemployment rate for female heads of household is 11.6 percent in the
northeast, and 9.7 percent in Brazil as a whole. Those women who are employed also receive
lower salaries than men, receiving only 82 percent of the income earned by men.

108. Despite efforts to improve endowments for women in Pernambuco, serious
problems persist. For example, maternal mortality remains very high with 76.4 deaths per
100,000 live births, based on 2008 data. In northeast Brazil, only Bahia has a higher maternal
death rate. Furthermore, although educational attainment is somewhat higher in Pernambuco
(6.07 years) for females than for males (5.58 years), that data is substantially lower than for
Brazil as a whole for the same period (6.38 and 5.91 years for females and males,
respectively). Females’ higher educational attainment, moreover, is not reflected in higher
returns to education compared to males. At 39.4 percent, the economically active female
population in the MAR is the lowest of the six largest metropolitan regions in Brazil16, which
show an average of 48.4 percent.

109. Females still experience heavy constraints in terms of agency both in the private
and public spheres. One example of this is teenage pregnancy, which remains a serious
problem in Pernambuco. Evidence suggests that pregnancy before the age of 20 has negative
implications for mothers and their children’s future opportunities in society.17 In Pernambuco,
the pregnancy rate for 15 to 19 years old girls was 74.4 per 1,000 live births, which ranks as
the fourth highest in the northeast Brazil and in the middle of the pack for Brazil as a whole.

110. A clear manifestation of the lack of agency is violence. While violent crime is an
issue that affects males disproportionately in Brazil and in Pernambuco, levels of
violence against females have remained high in recent years. The female homicide rate in
Pernambuco of between 6 and 7 per 100,000, remained high throughout the past decade, and
is second only to Alagoas in the northeast (6.8 per 100,000) and the fifth highest in all of
Brazil. Thirty-four percent of females in Pernambuco reported having experienced physical
violence, while 14 percent reported sexual violence at least once in their life (WHO, 2005).

111. While the State had maintained a Special Secretariat for Women since 2007, its
role and impact had been limited. The Special Secretariat for Women had the capacity to
cover only two major areas of activity: (i) rights-based training of women; and, (ii) job
training in non-traditional sectors for women in rural areas of the State through the Chapeu de
Palha program.18

   Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Porto Alegre.
17
   Teenage pregnancy is often correlated with higher poverty rates and lower economic opportunities of the
mother, as well as lower educational outcomes of the child. However there is little empirical evidence on
whether these correlations represent causal links, or on the direction of any causality.
18
   The Chapéu de Palha Program was created in 2007 with the objective of reaching families in the Zona
Canavieira (sugarcane producing region) who are unemployed in between harvests, and strengthening rural
populations’—and particularly females’—productive, social, and political capacities. Vocational training for
females is a special focus of the program and activities are implemented in partnership with SENAI (Serviço
Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial) and SENAC (Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Comercial). SecMulher

                                                    44
112. Government Actions Supported by the DPL: The DPL will support as a prior
action the creation of a Permanent Secretariat for Women to replace the former
temporary Special Secretariat for Women. By becoming a permanent secretariat,
SecMulher is able to more vigorously advance gender mainstreaming in the public sector,
while expanding its areas of focus to other key pressing gender issues in Pernambuco—
namely the protection of violence against females, gender education, and women’s and
maternal health. While many services currently exist to partially respond to these issues, the
ability to reach and address the specific issues and constraints facing women remains limited.
SecMulher is now able to promote more actively the institutional framework within the public
sector to support gender issues through specialized gender units to respond to issues affecting
the opportunities and wellbeing of women. It reflects the commitment of the Government of
Pernambuco to the importance and relevance of gender issues to the development of the State.

113. As a permanent secretariat, SecMulher has gained significant weight within the
governmental structure, which has greatly facilitated discussions with other Secretariats
in order to mainstream gender issues in the public sector. In this regard, it has initiated
partnerships with the Secretariat for Education (SecEdu) and the Secretariat for Health
(SecSaude) to mainstream gender issues into the daily functioning of the secretariats. In the
case of SecEdu, gender units will be established in full-time schools (Escolas de Referencia)
where gender sensitization activities will be developed and conducted with students and
teachers. Five pilot units are already in place and there are plans to expand this to all Escolas
de Referencia as well as 14 vocational training schools, reaching a total of 116 municipalities
and more than 70,000 students by the end of SecMulher’s current term. In the case of the
SecSaude, the partnership aims to define and implement strategic actions providing
comprehensive assistance and services to females in areas such as violence prevention,
screenings for cervical, breast, and skin cancer, and training on gender issues to municipal
health secretaries and coordinators.

114. Reducing and preventing violence against women is also an important area of
focus for SecMulher. It is working closely with the police and the judiciary to help
implement 19 regional women police stations by 2015. This is a very innovative initiative
since it will facilitate women’s access to police services, especially for those residing in
remote areas.19 To strengthen the support to women victims of violence, SecMulher initiated
training workshops on gender sensitization for police officers and public servants working in
the criminal justice sector. The objective is to train 1,000 people per workshop and to have
two workshops per year for a total of six workshops by 2014.


has organized a course to train females in non-traditional sectors (mechanics, construction, and electricity) with
the objective of changing the prevailing gender-specific obstacles to accessing the labor market in non-
traditional sectors. A condition for participation in these courses is the completion of a rights literacy course that
addresses basic concepts of citizenship, human rights, and gender equality. The trainings started in 2007 in the
Zona Canavieira and were expanded to the São Francisco Valley in 2009, and to the Agreste in 2010. Another
expansion of the project was initiated in 2011 to reach women in the coastal areas of Pernambuco. By becoming
a full secretariat, there will be a substantial increase in the number of women trained annually: an estimated 4300
females received vocational training in 2011 whereas 1,215 women received training in 2010. Moreover, there is
an interest from SecMulher to absorb the full execution of this program as of 2012.
18
   An Action Plan for Women Living in Rural Areas already exists.
19
   The fact that SecMulher is working closely with the police to open more women’s police stations is significant
since several women’s police stations have been closed in another state – Sao Paulo – as part of the restructuring
of the police force.

                                                         45
115. The SecMulher intends to expand its reach at the local level through the
establishment of regional coordinators to facilitate the articulation of policies and
programs with a gender perspective. The regional coordinators serve as an innovative
strategy to bring the services and advocacy of SecMulher to the local level. The regional
coordinators will be established as mobile units in the 12 regions of the State, with each
responsible for several municipalities. The regional coordinators will engage with the
municipalities to determine the quality and effectiveness of services provided to women,
identify and provide gender-based capacity building programs for public service providers,
and serve as a conduit to advocate for gender issues at the local level, conveying those needs
to SecMulher at the state level.

Policy Objective 2.3: Promote Economic Development through Support to SMEs and Rural
Producers

Policy Action 6:

The Borrower has taken the following steps to establish its Development Agency (Agência de
Fomento do Estado de Pernambuco, S.A.) (―AGEFEPE‖), aimed at promoting economic and social
development by supporting micro, small and medium-size enterprises and rural producers in local
production chains:
       (a)     the authorization by the Guarantor’s Central Bank (Banco Central do Brasil) to
               commence the operations of AGEFEPE on December 9, 2010; and
       (b)     the enactment of the Borrower’s Law No. 14.282 of March 29, 2011, allocating
               resources to AGEFEPE.



116. Description and Challenges: Economic growth in Pernambuco is highly
concentrated geographically, with weak links to local suppliers. Currently, 74 percent of
the GDP of the State is produced in the coastal area, in an area that encompasses 17 percent of
the territory and 57 percent of the population. The prevalent sector composition favors
demand for relatively unskilled labor and shows low productivity growth. The strategy to
attract investment to the Suape port complex has been accompanied by a definition of
strategic sectors that will be supported and eventually linked to the main growth drivers.
Among the large projects that are envisaged are an oil refinery, a shipyard, a plastic resin
factory, a pharma-chemical complex, and a car manufacturer (Fiat). Following these
prospects, the expectation is to maintain growth above the national average, increasing the
state’s share in national GDP and raising per capita GDP toward the national average.

117. The Government strategy for development is founded on three pillars. First,
enhancing skill levels and actively linking those to local needs for specific sectors, as
described under Policy Action 4. Second, implementing an active policy to attract investment,
generate economic activity, and increase long-term tax revenue as a result. Third, establishing
a professional agency that links credit for investment in small and medium enterprises in
strategic value chains to managerial, technical and market development support, as described
below.

118. Government Actions Supported through Proposed DPL: The DPL would support
as a prior action the establishment of a State Development Agency aimed at promoting
economic and social development by supporting micro, small, and medium-size

                                              46
enterprises (MSMEs) and rural producers in local production chains. The Agência de
Fomento Do Estado de Pernambuco (AGEFEPE) received formal approval to operate in early
2011 and has received an initial capital of R$30 million. Its mandate covers a wide range of
actions, all related to the provision of support for entrepreneurship. It focuses on both the
interiorização and internalização of value chains, promoting stronger links to local firms
within the State (particularly in the interior) that can supply large private firms and
government, strengthening also access to technology, quality control protocols,
commercialization networks, and managerial training. AGEFEPE, in conjunction with the
Secretariat for Economic Development, have conducted extensive studies and research to
determine growth-generating sectors and well-defined value chains in Pernambuco.

119. After the pilot stage, concluded in December 2011, AGEFEPE will scale up its
activities gradually. The agency will have an instrumental role in accessing federal funds
devoted to similar objectives. Once AGEFEPE is in full operation, it will be able to have a
portfolio ten times higher than its own capital, with minimum risk for the State. The priority
production sectors to be supported—after a series of feasibility studies—are: apparel; dairy
products; different kinds of supplies for government procurement; tourism and transport
(including taxi companies); and farming of high value added goods. The Rural Economic
Inclusion Project in Pernambuco, supported by the Bank, also offers potential for synergies
with AGEFEPE’s work through the integration of rural producers into local supply chains.

120. Estimates suggest that the State’s development strategy should add between 0.5
and 0.7 percent of annual GDP growth to the State after consolidation (the strategy
should be working at full scale by 2016). Given the nature of the priority sectors, the
strategy implies an important growth in the demand for technical (medium skill) workers, and
thus a reduction of unemployment and poverty in the interior of the State. A specific line of
activity is devoted to support gender-related priorities, providing services to women
entrepreneurs under competitive conditions and emphasizing support in sectors that generate
demand for female labor.

Policy Area 3: Increase Public Administration Capacity for Generating Results for
Pernambucanos

121. The Bank supports efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of public
management in Pernambuco as a means of enhancing equity and expanding the
opportunities of Pernambucanos. A more effective tax administration, which reduces
evasion, will increase the redistribution capacity of the State through the generation of more
resources. Improvements in budget management aim to allocate and execute more resources
in the strategic priorities identified through a participatory process. Finally, the establishment
of the Management Institute will contribute to the consolidation of Pernambuco’s Public
Management Model, which operationalizes the All for Pernambuco strategy by strengthening
the link between planning and budgeting, and promotes a participatory, centrally coordinated
approach and the monitoring of outputs and outcomes of social policies and programs.

Policy Objective 3.1: Improve ICMS Tax Revenues, without Increasing Tax Burden on
Firms and Citizens, to Expand Fiscal Space for Investment and Promote Private Sector
Development

  The Borrower has taken the following measures to improve tax revenues without increasing tax
  burdens on taxpayers:
  Policy Action 7:
          (a)    the establishment of a regulatory framework for the implementation of a new fiscal
                 control system (Sistema de Escrituração Fiscal e Contábil 2) (―SEF-2‖), as
                 evidenced by the Borrower’s Resolution (Portaria) No. 190, dated November 30,
                 2011, issued by SEFAZ; and
  Policy Action 8:
          (b)    the establishment of a Tax Substitution System for selected products, as evidenced
                 by Gubernatorial Decrees No. 35.655 of October 7, 2010 (linens), No. 35.656 of
                 October 7, 2010 (bicycles), No. 35.657 of October 7, 2010 (toys), No. 35.677 of
                 October 13, 2010 (cosmetics, pharmacy products and toiletries), No. 35.678 of
                 October 13, 2010 (construction and home design materials), No. 35.679 of October
                 13, 2010 (automobile parts), No. 35.680 of October 13, 2010 (electric materials)
                 and No. 35.701 of October 19, 2010 (electronic products and home appliances).



122. Description and Challenges: Pernambuco has shown strong commitment to
expand fiscal space for investments over the last five years and has achieved remarkable
results. Pernambuco was the top performer among Brazilian states in terms of real revenue
growth during the period 2005-2010, increasing by over 57 percent. Even with the financial
crisis, Pernambuco’s tax revenues increased by over 12.5 percent in real terms between 2008
and 2010, well above Brazilian states’ average of 5.9 percent. This increase is explained by
strong economic growth, but also by institutional improvements in SEFAZ, more effective
monitoring, and more capable information systems.

123. Despite this strong increase in revenues, there is considerable space for
enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration of the ICMS (tax on
goods and services)—the main source of revenue controlled by the state. The ICMS
represented over 44 percent of total tax revenues in 2010. Modernization and automation of
processes would enable a more efficient and effective control of ICMS compliance. Because
Pernambuco is a net importer of goods, its main efforts are focused on controlling goods
entering the state. Until 2010, this control was done physically upon arrival of the goods.
Taxes were calculated manually and on paper records, consuming substantial human
resources, and increasing the rates of mistakes and unregistered transactions, especially for
those products more difficult to control. Audits were mainly conducted ex-post, and planned
only after the arrival of documentation.

124. Government Actions Supported by the Proposed DPL: The DPL will support as
prior actions State policies to improve tax revenues without increasing the tax burden on
taxpayers. Two major efforts have been undertaken for strengthening controls of the ICMS
administration with the objective of increasing the fiscal space available for investments with
no additional tax burden on firms and citizens: (i) the implementation of the new fiscal control
system, Sistema de Escrituração Fiscal-2 (SEF-2); and (ii) the implementation of a tax

                                               48
substitution system for selected products with the highest risk of evasion, representing close
to 30 percent of ICMS tax collection.

125. The implementation of the new fiscal control system SEF-2 will increase the
quantity and quality of sales information, substantially reducing fiscal evasion (Policy
Action 7). SEF-2, approved by decree in February 2010 and implemented in November 2011
through Portaria No. 190, makes it mandatory for all firms and individuals reporting ICMS to
submit detailed information of all sales receipts electronically (previously, less detailed
information was provided and could be submitted in paper). The system also classifies the
way users provide information. In the past, firms may have undervalued their sales to small
and medium enterprises in their reports to the Government. The expansion in sales receipts,
combined with the higher level of detail required and the new electronic format, provides the
State with a powerful tool to detect and act on incompliance by taxpayers.

126. The establishment of a tax substitution system for selected products will allow the
State to perform more strategic and effective physical controls to reduce evasion and
promote voluntary tax compliance (Policy Action 8). A new electronic system, mandated
and in use since the issuance of eight decrees since November 2010, identifies goods,
registers sales electronically, and collects taxes at the point of sale for selected products with
high volumes of sales and highest risk of evasion.20 The automatic estimation of taxes at the
goods’ departure rather than at their arrival in Pernambuco, and the use of detailed
classification systems will ensure an easier process for taxpayers and will give the State more
time and resources to devote to strategic physical checks, increasing their effectiveness and
compliance with the tax system.21

Policy Objective 3.2: Improve the Efficiency of Budget Allocation and Execution

Policy Action 9:

The Borrower has improved the efficiency of budget allocation and execution through the formulation
and execution of the PPA and budget, both structured into strategic priorities, as evidenced by:
        (a)      the Borrower’s Law No. 14.234 of December 13, 2010;
        (b)      the Detalhamentos de Despesas                 por    Elemento     (DDEs)      published    in
                 www.transparencia.pe.gov.br; and
        (c)      letter dated September 12, 2011 from Secretary of SEPLAG attaching a report on the
                 budget execution by strategic priorities for the period January 1, 2011 through August
                 31, 2011.



127. Description and Challenges: Pernambuco has made important progress towards
linking its planning and budgeting processes. These improvements were made gradually,

20
   The decrees and products covered are the following: Gubernatorial Decrees No. 35.655 of October 7, 2010
(linens); No. 35.656 of October 7, 2010 (bicycles); No. 35.657 of October 7, 2010 (toys); No. 35.677 of October
13, 2010 (cosmetics, pharmacy products and toiletries); No. 35.678 of October 13, 2010 (construction and home
design material); No. 35.679 of October 13, 2010 (automobile parts); No. 35.680 of October 13, 2010 (electric
material); and No. 35.701 of October 19, 2010 (electronic products and home appliances).
21
   Pernambuco’s ICMS tax substitution system had already registered a 141 percent nominal increase in tax
collection for the period January-June 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 (Source: SEFAZ)

                                                      49
following a careful implementation strategy. The State moved from a fragmented budget
planning process that followed standard increases across the board based on inputs, to a new
Management Model. Beginning in 2008, along with other states, Pernambuco defined
strategic priorities following the Government’s plan and outcomes from participatory regional
meetings. The strategic priorities that result from this process inform the preparation of the
Plano Pluri-Annual (PPA) and budget formulation of individual institutions on an annual
basis. They are defined for the period of the Governor’s mandate and they align the allocation
of public expenditures to the State’s policy priorities.

128. By 2010, the planning process had fully incorporated the strategic priorities into
the budget formulation phase, but budget execution continued to follow a traditional
input-based structure. Budget execution through the financial management system E-Fisco
continued to track categories of expenses rather than expenditures related to specific policy
priorities. Physical and financial targets were linked manually during execution, placing
onerous demands on the administration to collect and analyze the data. While the State had
strengthened the controls over modifications to budget allocations during the fiscal year
compared to 2008, improved regulation was still needed to ensure strategic execution of
public expenditures. The new regulation needed to eliminate the practice of making changes
on a daily basis as a result of poor budget formulation, while providing the Government space
to address contingencies or changes in assumptions that occur during the fiscal year.

129. Government Actions Supported by the DPL: The DPL will support as a prior
action the State’s actions to improve the efficiency of budget allocation and execution.
The PPA and budget are now being formulated and executed to reflect Pernambuco’s strategic
priorities. The participatory process for the PPA—identifying strategic priorities and linked to
budget formulation through the Management Model—has now been further improved through
measures that contribute to ensuring resources are effectively spent on the Government’s
policy priorities.

130. The formulation and execution of the PPA and budget, structured into strategic
priorities, will allow for more effective verification that resources are being spent on the
Government’s strategic priorities. The introduction of the category sub-action in the budget
codes indicating the strategic priority together with the new programmatic and strategic
priority classification of the PPA and the budget allowed the State to allocate and execute
budget resources based on the State’s strategic priorities for the first time in 2011. Budget
execution per strategic priority can now be monitored in real time, using E-Fisco—the State’s
financial management system – ensuring that allocation and execution of public expenditures
match the State’s development plan, and providing key information for decision makers
during the year.

131. The new regulation of budget modifications during the fiscal year will also
contribute to strengthening the link between budget formulation and execution.
Governor’s Decree 36.092/2011 and Resolution 2/2011, issued jointly by SEFAZ, SEPLAG,
SAD and SECGE in January 2011, regulate potential modifications made to the budget during
execution by: (i) introducing a governance system for doing so; and (ii) creating specific
periods for ordinary changes and providing flexibility for extraordinary circumstances. This
reform will encourage a more careful budget formulation by line ministries and will help to
protect budget allocations made towards strategic priorities from potential reductions during
the fiscal year.

Policy Objective 3.3: Improve Capacity to Plan and Implement Public Policies through the
Institutionalization of Pernambuco’s Management Model

Prior Action 10:
The Borrower has consolidated its Management Model and strengthened its capacity to
generate results through the establishment of the Management Institute, as evidenced by
Gubernatorial Decree No. 37.828, dated February 2, 2012.


132. Description and Challenges: Pernambuco has improved its capacity to plan and
implement public policies by taking initial steps for the institutionalization of the State’s
Management Model. Strengthening SEPLAG through the establishment of the Management
Institute and the implementation of the Planning, Budgeting and Management (PBM) career
represent important milestones towards this goal.

133. The State has taken steps toward the long-term goal of developing its human
resources with the objective of strengthening the public administration’s capacity to
deliver. The creation of the PBM career in June 2008 represented a key milestone in
improving capacity within the center of government, as well as in institutionalizing the State’s
new Management Model.22 The creation of positions for administrative management analysts
and internal control analysts also supported the stated objective.23 However, as of November
2010, only 15 PBM analysts had been appointed out of the 220 authorized positions. As a
means of capacity building, the Government also invested significant resources in staffing and
increasing pay for public servants in service-delivery sectors, such as health, education, and
security. This was done to attract and retain skilled personnel while staying within the
personnel expenditures limit established in the Fiscal Responsibility Law.

134. Government Actions Supported by DPL: The DPL will support as a prior action
the consolidation of the State’s Management Model through the establishment of the
Management Institute in order to strengthen its capacity to generate results. The lack of
a ―whole-of-government‖ view, aligning the Government’s priorities in its development plan
with policy-making, program formulation, and program implementation, is a chronic problem
in Latin America (World Bank, 2010). The Management Institute, a strategic unit within
SEPLAG, will help institutionalize the State’s Management Model through a legal mandate
to: (i) monitor the connection between the All for Pernambuco strategy, and the planning
instruments (PPA and Budget law), and the Management Model, thereby ensuring a ―whole-
of-government‖ view in the planning instruments and avoiding isolated and inconsistent
agendas from line ministries and agencies; (ii) developing, structuring, implementing, and
updating the social management report, to be produced on an annual basis, including
performance indicators on education, health, and the labor market, and providing outcome
information on the State’s priority areas defined through regular consultation with all
Pernambucanos; (iii) designing and implementing a continuous training program for
politicians holding management positions, senior public sector managers, and PBM analysts
across the administration to strengthen a ―whole-of-government‖ view; and, (iv) linking the
State with external entities for the discussion of public policies in Pernambuco. The
establishment of the Management Institute will institutionalize the Management Model by
22
     Lei Complementar No. 118/2008
23
     Lei Complementar No. 117 and 119/2008

                                              51
assigning the functions mentioned above to a technical institution led by permanent staff,
ensuring political neutrality and continuity across different administrations.


VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

C. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

135. The proposed operation is expected to have a positive effect on poverty reduction
and socioeconomic equity. As explained above, the Government’s development plan for the
period 2011-2014 and this DPL aim to ensure a more equal geographic distribution of the
benefits of growth. For the purpose of the operation, a thorough analysis of potential impacts
of the supported policies on poverty and equity was carried out. The Poverty and Social
Impact Assessment (PSIA) concluded unambiguously that the policy package under the
proposed DPL will have a progressive incidence and will enhance equity.24

136. Poverty reduction in Pernambuco, as in the rest of Brazil, has occurred alongside
persistent socioeconomic disparities. Brazil made notable progress in reducing poverty in
the past decade. Data reveals that Brazil’s poverty rate declined significantly from 29.1
percent in 2006 to 22.1 percent in 2009.25 In Pernambuco, poverty reduction was even more
striking than in the northeast and Brazil as a whole: poverty in Pernambuco fell from 48.6
percent in 2006 to 38.3 percent in 2009. Such a reduction, however, hides regional and
within-state heterogeneity. The policies supported in the proposed operation take these
inequities into consideration and target the areas of the State that are lagging behind in
socioeconomic terms.

Policy Area 1: Improving the Quality of Life of Pernambucanos

137. In the area of education reform and the extension of hours of instruction, priority
will be given to schools in relatively backward areas. The expected improvement of the
quality of education will lead to higher employability, raising the potential earnings for people
in those areas. The extended school hours may also have an effect on reducing youth
involvement in violent and criminal activity, in addition to potentially reducing teenage
pregnancy, particularly in the poorest municipalities.26

138. The water resources management components, focused on the improvement of
water security and reliability of supply, will also have a positive distributional impact.
The new framework and the creation of APAC, by increasing water security, will favor poor
urban communities and rural areas, which have been traditionally affected by unreliability of
water supply. Health-related outcomes, such as reductions in child mortality and morbidity,
are positively influenced by more reliable water provision in relatively poor areas, particularly
in the urban sector. In the rural sector, there is a time-use related gain for the poor, especially
women, who typically spend a non-negligible amount of time transporting and collecting

24
   The PSIA is being finalized. All the PSIA-related documentation will be available, including the list of
stakeholder meetings that took place. The PSIA is based on survey data, administrative data and in-depth
interviews.
25
   Using the World Bank 4USD/day moderate poverty line. As a result, percentages may differ from those using
Brazil’s official moderate poverty line. Unless otherwise specified, poverty rates are for head of household.
26
   The evidence in the literature is based on the Chilean case (Krueger and Berthelon, 2011).

                                                     52
water. Alternative suppliers may oppose the reform on the grounds that an increase in the
efficiency of the system could reduce their business. Indeed, poorer people tend to buy water
from alternative suppliers, at higher prices, whenever the system does not satisfy their
demand.

139. The risk and disaster management policies supported by the operation can be
expected to have a large pro-equity impact. Qualitative evidence reveals that such policies
have the support of rural producers, rural workers, unions, and NGOs. This is mainly due to
recent experiences droughts and floods that have imposed economic and social costs on these
groups. The policies supported by the DPL are expected to contribute to reducing the
economic and human costs associated with population displacement in the semi-arid zone of
the State. Disaster risk and losses due to extreme events have been shown to be associated
with socioeconomic conditions: in other words, the same level of exposure tends to result in
higher relative losses for poorer populations, both with regard to physical assets and non-
tangible assets (due to the interruption of schooling and health services). As the PSIA shows,
the map of disaster risk exposure overlaps with the poverty map. Thus, reducing the
magnitude of the impact of extreme events, through the policies supported by the operation, is
likely to have pro-poor implications.

Policy Area 2: New Economy—Expanding Opportunities for Pernambucanos

140. The promotion of economic development and job creation, through the policies
supported by the DPL, are expected to be positive for all stakeholders. The PSIA analysis
concludes that labor unions, entrepreneurs’ associations, families, and NGOs are all likely to
support these policies. Stronger links between the supply of and demand for skills and the
interiorization of value chains linked to the Suape port will promote more inclusive growth in
the State. The newly-created Development Agency (AGEFEPE) aims to boost job-creation
and improve the benefits of growth. The structure and financing of the agency does not
represent a fiscal burden, and it may become an instrument to obtain more resources from
centralized funds to finance local development.

141. The policies supported by this DPL, including the support to the establishment of
the SecMulher as a permanent secretariat and the implementation of partnerships with
other sectors, will enhance economic, social and cultural opportunities for women in a
non-regressive way. Certainly, when analyzing gender-related measures the most common
framework is to think in terms of between-group inequalities.27 The PSIA shows that gaps in
female labor force participation and entrepreneurship are likely to be reduced through the
policies in this operation.


Policy Area 3: Increase Public Administration Capacity for Generating Results for
Pernambucanos

142. A more effective tax administration will increase the State Government’s
resources to implement its All for Pernambuco strategy, while online monitoring of
budget execution by strategic priority will ensure the State’s funds are spent on the

27
  Decomposable inequality measures (such as the Theil index) can shed light into Between-group versus within-
group inequality in population groups.

                                                     53
strategy priorities. The strengthening of the tax administration capacities of the State does
not imply an increase of tax burden on the poor. The estimated increase in revenues due to
improved tax administration would support the Government’s efforts towards poverty
reduction and would have a progressive effect. Online monitoring of budget execution by
priority will ensure revenues are spent according to existing priorities and will enhance budget
execution for these programs, making the pro-poor effects even stronger. Finally, the
consolidation of the Management Model, which ensures a central coordination of the planning
and budget processes following State priorities and periodically monitors the performance of
strategic priorities, will help to keep the focus on results of the All for Pernambuco Strategy.

D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

143. The policies supported by this operation are likely to have a significant positive
impact on the environment, forests and natural resources. The associated programs can
also contribute to the protection of the region’s environment. Strengthening evaluation and
management will have positive impacts on environmental protection.

144. The principal environmental implications of the proposed DPL stem from the
water and disaster risk management components. Under objective 1.2—Improve Water
Security and Increase Reliable Water Supply—several substantial positive effects on human
welfare are expected outcomes: (a) an expected 400,000 more Pernambucanos with increased
reliability and security of urban water; and (b) improved water supply management.
Managing water systems more efficiently implies not only looking at infrastructure but also at
the source of water and how land-use practices upstream affect the quality, quantity and
timing of water delivery. With regard to objective 1.3—Disaster and Risk Management—
timing and quantity of water delivery is of significant importance. In addition to the positive
impacts on human welfare, the policy supported by this DPL is expected to positively and
durably impact environmental management in the State of Pernambuco.

145. Pernambuco faces problems of water scarcity and water leakages, being one of
the driest states in Brazil with per capita water availability of 1,320 m³/year on average,
equivalent to only 3.5 percent of the national average per capita availability. The State’s
semi-arid Sertão and Agreste sub-regions represent 89 percent of the State’s territory and have
only about 20 percent of the water available in the State, with per capita water availability
ranging from 400 m³ per year to 800 m³ per year, respectively. The coastal wetter sub-regions
of Mata Pernambucana and the MAR concentrate 57 percent of the population, mainly in the
metropolitan area of Recife (43 percent of the State population and 65 percent of the State
GDP) and about 80 percent of the available water. Improved management of scare water
resources is critical to ensuring that they are allocated and used in an equitable and sustainable
manner, all the more so in the larger context of climate change, which is likely to exacerbate
current vulnerabilities to climatic shocks and natural hazards.

146. Although the legal framework for water resources management in Pernambuco
includes all basic principles of modern water management, implementation of the State
water resources management (WRM) policy has been hindered by the lack of adequate
information and institutional capacity. Furthermore, environmental management in Brazil
is decentralized across the three tiers of government—federal, state and municipal. Most
environmental licensing and enforcement is under the responsibility of the state agencies. The

                                               54
strengthening of the capacity of state-level institutions is critical to achieve sustainable
improvement in environmental management. The policies supported by this DPL will
contribute to strengthening the State of Pernambuco’s capacity and preparedness to address
water and disaster management issues, particularly through the newly created Agência
Pernambucana de ?guas e Clima (APAC).


E. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

147. The State Secretariat of Planning and Management (SEPLAG) will be
responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed operation. This will be done
in close coordination with other relevant line secretariats, namely the Secretary of Education,
the Secretary for Water Resources, and the Secretary for Economic Development, as well as
several complementing agencies that support the reform programs included in the policy
matrix.

148. SEPLAG has instituted an elaborate monitoring and evaluation system for its
strategic priorities. The Governor convenes a meeting of the secretaries of all the State
secretariats to assess progress on strategic objectives, analyze advances towards reaching
outcome and results indicators, and identify obstacles to progress and budgetary implications.
As the proposed operation is fully aligned with the State’s strategic map, the progress of the
indicators defined under this program will be monitored as part of this process. This will
facilitate regular updates of program implementation and allow for necessary adjustments.

F. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management (PFM)

149. The Bank’s knowledge of the public financial management system in
Pernambuco is based on a Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment that was finalized in 2009 and on subsequent analyses undertaken in the
preparation and supervision of Bank lending operations, including the SWAP.

150. A centerpiece of Government’s All for Pernambuco strategy is the commitment to
increasing the capacity and efficiency of public administration, including strengthening
public financial management. The State Government’s reelection to another term represents
recognition that this commitment has been translated into actions aimed at improving service
delivery. The strategy recognizes transparency, accountability and the increased efficiency of
public expenditures as key elements necessary to ensure equitable economic growth in the
State. To achieve these, the Government has undertaken a number of reforms to enhance
efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of public funds. These reforms have
been aimed at strengthening linkages between strategic planning and the budget preparation
process, increasing capacity for the accounting and internal audit functions, and upgrading
information systems.

151. The Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil underpins the management
of public finances at all levels of Government throughout the country. More detailed
requirements and guidelines relating to PFM procedures to be adopted at all levels of
government are contained in a well-developed legal framework. This framework was

                                              55
developed through the introduction of legal and institutional reforms to help strengthen
accountability and transparency in the management of public finances in Brazil. A public
accountability law (Lei 4.320 of 1964) regulates financial controls, budgeting and reporting at
the federal, state and municipal levels. The Law of Fiscal Responsibility (LRF) of 2000
established particular requirements for macroeconomic and fiscal discipline. The federal
government is leading an initiative to adopt international public sector accounting standards
that will improve financial reporting and accountability at all levels in Brazil. These reforms
have been implemented in an environment characterized by increased demand for
accountability in the use of public resources.

152. The PFM system consists of strong internal rules and controls. These clearly
define the roles of the different institutions involved in the management of public funds
and allocate responsibilities between them. The legislature is responsible for approving the
budget and for oversight of its execution. SEPLAG is responsible for the preparation of the
budget while SEFAZ undertakes budget execution duties. The budget classification system is
governed by federal rules that are consistent with international standards. These rules require
the publication of comprehensive information in the budget documents. Brazil scores highly
on the 2010 Open Budget Index, indicating that significant information is provided to the
public in budget documents.28 Accounting rules and regulations are generally respected and
there is a high level of transparency with respect to financial information on the State’s
transactions. This is due to a number of factors, including the clarity with which relevant laws
describe obligations in relation to the preparation of these financial statements, and the
diligence with which they are applied.

153. The budget preparation process is orderly, and is guided by well-defined budget
preparation procedures and calendar. These establish proper sequencing and allow
sufficient time for budget preparation activities. The State has consistently met the deadlines
for the preparation of the key budget documents (the Plano Plurianual de Ação (PPA), the Lei
de Diretrizes Orçamentárias (LDO) and the Lei Orçamentária Annual (LOA)), and for their
submission to the legislature for their consideration and approval. The process is designed in
such a way as to promote participation by all key stakeholders and sectoral agencies. The PPA
provides a reasonable foundation for a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, upon which
further linkages to the annual budgeting process can be built. It covers a period of four years,
the latest being 2008 to 2011.

154. Despite this fairly robust multi-year planning framework, there are remaining
inconsistencies between the program objectives, costs and targets listed in the PPA, and
those reflected in the work plans of budget agencies, and the execution reports prepared
by them. This weakens the linkage between multi-year planning and the annual budgeting
process. The definition of program objectives, costs and targets in the PPA is at times
inconsistent with that in the LOA. Also, PPAs do not sufficiently reflect the lifecycle costs of
investment programs. The Government is committed to improving the medium-term outlook
in its planning and budgeting process, through better coordination between planning agencies
and the sector and financial units in individual secretariats.

155. Pernambuco’s new E-Fisco financial management information system represents
a vast improvement. E-Fisco contains an accounting module that is used to link the

28
     See http://www.internationalbudget.org/files/OBI2010-Brazil.pdf.

                                                        56
approved budget with accounting and budget execution data. For a number of years,
Pernambuco used the Integrated System for State Financial Management (SIAFEM) as its
integrated financial management information system. The PEFA review noted weaknesses
resulting from the outdated architecture upon which it was based, which limited its usefulness
as a management tool. The new system also enables the real time capture of transaction data,
making budget execution data instantly available for the preparation of financial reports.
These are prepared in conformity with federal laws and regulations. In addition, the system is
used to provide citizens of Pernambuco access to budget execution data, thus promoting
transparency in the use of public funds.

156. Pernambuco is undertaking a number of reforms to prepare for the
implementation of the new accounting requirements, including the adoption of a plan of
accounts and training of staff. Brazil has established a timetable for the adoption of
international public sector accounting standards in all federal entities by 2013. Upgrading the
information system will also facilitate the implementation of the new accounting procedures
once introduced.

157. Weaknesses in the internal audit function of the State were noted during the
PEFA assessment. Since then, the State established the Secretaria Especial da Controladoria
Geral do Estado (SECGE) to undertake internal audits. The head of the SECGE reports
directly to the Governor, thus enhancing its independence. The department has sufficient
access to other government departments to enable it to undertake its audits, and its
recommendations are generally implemented. The Government continues to strengthen the
SECGE through the creation of a specific career path designed to increase the professionalism
of staff in the department. It has also undertaken a recruitment drive and training program for
staff aimed at increasing their knowledge and skills.

158. The responsibility for external audit of the accounts of the Government and its
agencies is exercised by the Tribunal de Contas do Estado (TCE) of Pernambuco (TCE).
The TCE enjoys operational independence and its staffing is considered sufficient for it
to carry out its duties. In addition to compliance and financial audits, the TCE has recently
embarked on performance audits in a bid to help enhance efficiency in the use of public funds.
The recommendations of the TCE are generally implemented, partly due to an effective
system it uses to monitor its previous recommendations.

159. A specific committee, whose recommendations are submitted to the legislature
plenary session for approval, carries out legislative scrutiny of the budget. Rules for
budget amendments during the budget execution cycle are clear and these establish
limits to which the administration adheres. The above assessment indicates that the PFM
environment in Pernambuco meets the Bank’s requirements and is adequate to support the
proposed operation. In addition, through the preparation of Pernambuco’s development
strategy and actions undertaken subsequently to implement related reforms, the Government’s
commitment to a strong PFM environment is satisfactory.

Foreign Exchange Control Environment

160. The IMF undertook a Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank of Brazil in
October 2002 and updated it in March 2004. It concluded that the Central Bank does
not present widespread vulnerabilities that could compromise the safeguarding of Fund

                                              57
resources. The Bank also undertook a review of the financial statements of the Central Bank
to assess the extent to which the foreign exchange control environment remained adequate. As
part of this review, the Bank examined the financial statements for the years ending December
31, 2006 to 2010. These included Explanatory Notes to the financial statements and a report
of the independent audit carried out by an international firm of auditors. The latter contained
an unqualified opinion on the financial statements for all years. The Explanatory Notes, an
integral part of the financial statements, provide an extensive explanation of the Central
Bank’s risk management policies, including those related to financial instruments held to
manage the international reserves.

161. In relation to operational risks, the Explanatory Notes state that the Central
Bank ―uses internal control systems, which are considered adequate for its activities.‖
The Bank’s conclusion based on the review of the financial statements was that the control
environment governing the Central Bank’s operations, within which the loan’s foreign
exchange would flow, continued to be adequate.

G. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

162. The proposed loan will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy lending loans. The funds will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and will not be tied to any specific
purchases. Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the Bank will
deposit the proceeds of the loan in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to
the Bank at the Banco do Brasil S.A. This commercial bank is an acceptable financial
institution for the Bank as it is: (a) financially sound; (b) authorized to maintain the account in
the currency agreed between the Bank and the Borrower; (c) is audited regularly, and has
received satisfactory audit reports (reviewed December 31, 2010 Financial Statements audited
by KPMG); (d) able to execute a large number of transactions promptly; (e) is able to perform
a wide range of banking services satisfactorily; (f) is able to provide a detailed statement of
the account; (g) is part of a satisfactory correspondent banking network; and (h) charges
reasonable fees for its services.

163. This account at the Banco do Brasil S.A is denominated in local currency and does not
form part of the country’s official foreign exchange reserves. The State will ensure that upon
the deposit of the loan into said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the State’s
budget management system. The State will provide a confirmation to the Bank that an
equivalent amount was accounted for in the State’s budget management system. Such
confirmation will be sent to the Bank within 30 days after payment. If the proceeds of the
loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, the
Bank would require the State to refund the amount. Due to the conclusions related to the
adequacy of the State’s public financial management environment, no additional fiduciary
arrangements will be put in place for the operation.

H. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

The proposed operation is considered to have moderate to substantial risks.

164. Economic and fiscal risks are related to prudent management of the State of
Pernambuco's fiscal position in an uncertain global environment. Even though the State
of Pernambuco has a strong fiscal stance, its domestic tax collection from the ICMS tax
revenues are vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations in Brazil and partner countries, as
well as changes in the tax base stemming from fiscal wars and tax evasion. Most of the
planned investments in the State will come from European firms (such as Fiat). As such,
Pernambuco’s revenues may be vulnerable to developments in Europe, the slowing of U.S.
growth, as well as a potential hard landing from China. Risk to the ICMS is mitigated by the
significant increase in the state’s tax collection over the last years, and the low level of
indebtedness of the State. The former is due to economic growth, efficiency reforms, and the
commitment of the State Government to implement more reforms in tax administration,
including those supported in this DPL.

165. The State may face fiscal pressure due to the investment requirements for the
World Cup. The reforms in public sector management supported by this operation are
designed to mitigate these risks by improving efficiency as well as prioritization of
expenditures, mainly through the linkage of expenditures to the strategic priorities in the PPA.

166. There may be deficits in institutional capacity, which can affect program
implementation. Given the emphasis of the operation in supporting the interior of the State, it
is likely that existing capacity issues may weaken the implementation of policy reforms. The
investments being made in the interior also include further development of human capital. As
such, the activities will be complemented with capacity building in both the public and private
sectors.

167. In an environment of fiscal competition among Brazilian states, the federal
Government has initiated a discussion with all states on possible institutional changes
related to the ICMS. In addition, the outcome related to the rules to distribute the
royalties is highly uncertain. ICMS, a value-added tax on the commerce of goods and
services, represents the main revenue source for the State. The federal Government is
considering possible institutional changes to the ICMS. The rules for the distribution of
royalties to the states are also under discussion. As a mitigation measure, the State
Government is aware of the risks and has taken appropriate measures, bringing the level of
debt to a manageable standard and strengthening its fiscal stance. In terms of royalties,
Pernambuco is not dependent on those, and can only benefit from any change.

168. The political economy of reforms in education may imply opposition on the side
of teachers to the reforms. The extended hours in schools require either more hours worked
by teachers or more teachers working. In both cases, there may be reasons for teachers to
oppose the reforms. They have argued, for example, that extended hours require also
investment in equipment and materials in order to be effective. As a mitigation measure, there
also exists a program for incentives to teachers, and there is permanent dialogue with teachers
to ensure that their concerns do not turn into active opposition to reform.

ANNEX 3: MACRO ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY IN THE
STATE OF PERNAMBUCO

Current Macroeconomic Outlook of the State of Pernambuco


1.      The State of Pernambuco is the second largest economy in the northeast of Brazil.
Pernambuco accounted for about 2.3 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP)
ranking as the tenth economy of the country in 2008. Pernambuco population of 9 million
inhabitants represents 4.6 percent of total national population. Pernambuco, like other
northeastern states has long lagged the rest of Brazil in terms of socioeconomic development,
with a GDP per capita about half the national average at R$8,065 in 2008.

2.     Poverty has come down significantly in the past decade. Brazil’s social policies coupled
with high economic growth averaging over five percent annually since 2003, and have lifted a
great part of the poor into the middle class. The percentage of the population living below
extreme poverty line has decreased from 33 percent in 2003 to 17 percent in 2009.37

3.      The State is now starting a new growth period that will need to be more inclusive than in
the past to reduce poverty and inequality. In the 1970s, the State benefited along with the rest of
Brazil from high growth rates, albeit lower than the national average. In the 1980s and the 1990s,
GDP average growth dropped but remained close to the national and northeast average; however,
poverty and inequality increased substantially, exceeding national and northeastern rates. In the
early 2000s, Pernambuco growth declined well below the northeast and the national average. The
year 2003 marks an inflexion point for State growth and the beginning of an accelerated growth
period which brought the State on a par with national average growth rates. Nevertheless,
Pernambuco has yet to turn higher growth rates into lower poverty and inequality statistics. In
2009, the share of the population below the poverty line was twice that of Brazil and well above
the northeastern average (Figure A3.1).

  The extreme poverty line is defined as the cost of a basic food basket that supplies the minimum individual caloric
intake. The extreme poverty line varies between regions, states, urban, rural and metropolitan areas. Poverty lines
account for these differences.

Note: The poverty line is defined as the double of the extreme poverty line, which is defined as the cost of a basic food basket
that supplies the minimum individual caloric intake. The poverty line varies between regions, states, urban, rural and
metropolitan areas. Poverty lines account for these differences.



4.      Recently, Pernambuco’s growth pace has accelerated above the country average. The
State’s economy was quite resilient to the global financial crisis, with a 5.2 percent estimated
real growth in 2009 well above the 0.6 percent decrease in the national GDP. Estimates for 2010
indicate that Pernambuco’s real growth was 9.3 percent, against the 7.5 percent Brazilian GDP
growth (Figure A3.2). This is a result in part of the State’s increased capacity to invest in
physical and social infrastructure. The State Government plans to continue and even accelerate
its pace of investment in the medium term in partnership with the private sector and the federal
government. Of the estimated R$64.8 billion investments that will take place until 2015, R$46.3
billion will come from the State Government (including through partnerships with the federal
government), R$10.9 billion from national private sector, and R$7.6 billion from foreign private
sector. A large share of the resources will support investment in the industrial sector.

5.      The State boasts a diversified economy with a strong presence of the tertiary sector. In
2008, services accounted for 72.8 percent of gross value added of the state, while industry and
agriculture represented 21.8 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively (Figure A3.3). These shares
have been quite constant over the past decade. Pernambuco has a greater participation of the
tertiary sector when compared to the national average, while industry participation is lower than
the national average, and agriculture’s contribution are on a par with the national average. A

7.     Recent growth fostered the creation of formal jobs which enabled Pernambuco to sharply
reduce its unemployment rate. The unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of Recife, which
accounts for 42 percent of the State population, fell from an annual average of 14.6 percent in
2006 to 8.7 percent in 2010, and maintained a downward trend in 2011. The unemployment rate
is moving towards the national average and declining at a faster rate than that of Bahia. The
unemployment rate in the MAR shifted from 10.9 percent in August 2009 to 6.7 percent in the
same month of 2011. In Bahia the unemployment rate changed from 11.4 to 8.9 percent in the
same period (Figure A3.6).

8.      Pernambuco has had a negative trade balance since 1993. During 2004-2010 Pernambuco
exports grew at an average annual rate of 13.6 percent while imports increased at a 27.6 percent
average annual rate, in part due to currency appreciation (see Figure A3.7). The Government’s
strategy aims to strengthen logistic services for the industrial sector that can also benefit
surrounding states. The State strategy also views the development in logistics as an important
source of growth for the tertiary sector. This is the case for the Suape complex, around the port
of the same name. Indeed the State’s recent dynamic activity has been linked to the development
of the Suape Port, which has helped to attract a massive influx of public and private investments
to the MAR.

Recent Evolution of Fiscal and Debt Indicators for the State of Pernambuco

9.      Over the past decade, the State of Pernambuco has achieved fiscal consolidation.
Stronger growth as well as the debt renegotiation and the LRF have allowed the State to
drastically reduce NCD, build up fiscal balance, and slowly increase investment. On the debt
front, application of the steady debt payment of 11.5 percent of NCR until 2007 has significantly
cut down NCD from 104 percent of NCR in 2004 to 39 percent of NCR in 2010. On the fiscal
side, increased efficiency in collecting tax and economic growth has strengthened tax collection
and thus revenues. The State was also able to curb the growth of expenditures. In a context
where most current expenditures are mandated by the constitution, the state’s control of the wage
bill is commendable. Revenues outgrew expenditures, and have quickly rebounded from the
crisis (Figure A3.8). As such, gross operating balances and investment have markedly increased
since 2007 and have been resilient to the crisis (A3.8 and A3.9).

10.     Total revenues grew at an average of 10.8 percent in real terms during 2004-2010, one of
the highest rates among Brazilian states. This revenues growth was due to the good performance
of all main revenues categories: tax revenues; transfers; social contributions; and other revenues.
The good performance of tax revenue also owes much to the increase of intergovernmental
transfers and extraordinary revenues. Also, the improved performance owed much to higher
collection of social contributions from public employees, almost inexistent in 2003 and now
accounting for almost 25 percent of pension payments (Table A3.1 and Figure A3.10). The
employers’ contribution to the pension fund—FUNAFIN—reached 27 percent of payroll in
February 2010 with employees contributing 13.5 percent of payroll.

11.     On the tax revenue side, the evolution of ICMS is strong and positive, driven by
economic growth and improved efficiency. ICMS increased quickly since 2004, due mainly to
tax management measures, particularly tax payer substitution systems and the adoption of the
electronic fiscal note. Recent robust economic growth is helping as well. The ratio of ICMS to
GDP increased from 8.2 percent in 2002 to 8.7 percent in 2008, one of the most significant
performances in the northeast (Table A3.2).

12.    Transfer revenues have increased in terms of net current revenue since 2006. FPE, the
main component of the federal transfers, decreased over the last years and stood at 27.1 percent
of NCR as of 2010. In contrast, revenues from Convenios and the Fund for the Development of
Basic Education and Valuing of Education Professionals (FUNDEB) have increased (Table
A3.3). Regarding the Convenios (Co-financing agreement with the federal government),
Pernambuco has received higher health transfers (SUS—Sistema Único de Saúde) as a result of
the new attribution to the states of full management of health services in their territories (Gestão
Plena). Under this condition, the states received from the Ministry of Health not only resources
to fund the state health net, but also resources to pay for services provided by units registered in
the SUS—private companies, philanthropic organizations and the smaller municipalities. In
2009, SUS provided a substantial amount of resources to the states and municipalities, due
mainly to a revision of the per capita values that partially regulate the amounts transferred. Also,
the increase in transfers from FUNDEB (an instrument of intergovernmental financial
cooperation for improving education) benefited from the legal change. The sources of the initial
Fund for the Development of Fundamental Education and Valuing of Educational Professionals
(FUNDEF) were transformed in 2007 into FUNDEB and expanded to cover not only basic
education, but also early childhood care centers (under the responsibility of municipalities) and
high schools (under the responsibility of states).

13.    Pernambuco tax revenue to transfers ratio remains high, albeit decreasing. In 2010, the
tax revenues to transfer ratio stood at 1.30, compared with an average of 0.90 in the rest of the
northeast (Table A3.2). The decrease, occurring from 2004 onwards, is due not to low
performance of tax revenues but to higher transfers in recent years, especially from SUS and
FUNDEB.

14.    The inter-governmental fiscal arrangements between the State of Pernambuco, its
municipalities, and the federal Government are deemed adequate. Transfers of expenditures to
municipalities are rule-based and represent a fixed amount of 25 percent of ICMS revenues and
50 percent of the property tax on motor vehicles (IPVA) revenues. Transfers to municipalities
remained stable at around 19 percent of Pernambuco’s net current revenues (Table A3.3).
Pernambuco is a net contributor to FUNDEB: the State of Pernambuco provided up to R$2.0bn
and received the amount of R$1.3bn in 2010.

15.     Total current expenditure grew at an average annual real rate of 9.3 percent between 2004
and 2010, slightly lower than the average 10.8 percent for total revenues. The Government has
been successful in planning and monitoring costs and controlling expenses since 2004. Control
over personnel expenditures has allowed the Government to decrease their share of NCR. The
increase in goods and services expenses is in part explained by increased investment in health
and education, which generate higher maintenance and operating costs. The increase in the
resources from the federal Ministry of Health through SUS has also mirrored those higher costs.
Finally, interest payments have gone down, as the debt level went down with fiscal consolidation
(Table A3.4 and Figures A3.12 and A3.13).

16.     Pernambuco’s net consolidated debt has been falling since 2003. Due to growing fiscal
revenues and consistent fiscal adjustment, the net consolidated debt-to-revenue ratio fell steeply
from over 104 percent of NCR in 2004 to 39 percent by 2010, well within the LRF limit of 200
percent (Table A3.5 and Figure A3.13). During 2004-2008, Pernambuco made large amounts of
amortization. Debt service has been decreasing since 2004, driven by lower interest payments
and increasing NCR. The fiscal adjustments led to an increasing gross operating balance, which
created space for investments. The State was also able to contract new loans with its improved
fiscal and debt situation. As such, the ratio of investment to NCR steadily improved from 5.8
percent in 2007 to 14.6 percent in 2010.

17.      Pernambuco’s fiscal situation is deemed adequate and in compliance with the prudential
limits set out in the LRF since 2004. Over the past decade, all the fiscal indicators improved. Net
personnel expenses were stable and net consolidated debt has fallen significantly. All indicators
are well within the prudential limits set in the LRF (Table A3.7). As of 2010, the State has met
all fiscal targets defined in the rolling three year Fiscal Adjustment Program—PAF—negotiated
with the National Treasury Secretariat (Table A3.8).

Medium-Term Fiscal and Debt Sustainability

18.     The projected fiscal and debt paths for the State of Pernambuco are deemed sustainable
in the medium term. The baseline scenario projections indicate a sustainable path, with positive
primary fiscal balances. Pernambuco’s fiscal balances (the primary fiscal balance, the overall
balance, and the gross operating balance) are all expected to record surpluses for the projected
period, allowing fiscal space for state investments, while net consolidated debt is projected to fall
from 39 percent of net current revenue in 2010 to 20.1 percent by 2020. The debt trend is
determined by current revenue and expenditure dynamics, whose difference is the gross
operating balance (GOP). After deducting amortization from the GOP, any remaining fiscal
resources are assumed to be used for investment.

19.     In particular, baseline projections for the period 2010-2020 depict a fiscal framework
marked by both revenue and expenditure growth. The principal drivers of revenue growth are
taxes (primarily from ICMS, which is heavily dependent on economic growth) and current
transfers from the federal Government (from Convenios and FUNDEB). Other current revenues
are also increasing, albeit at a lower rate, while capital transfers are constant in real terms. On the
expenditure side, growth is being driven by capital expenditures. Current expenditures are rising
largely on account of new judicial debt payment obligations (precatorios), increases in employee
compensation and goods and services, as well as sub-national transfers to municipalities and to
FUNDEB (Table A3.10). Overall, current expenditures are declining as a share of total expenses
from 94 percent in 2004 to 84 percent in 2020.

20.     In the baseline scenario, the debt dynamic is sustainable and complies with the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. Based on data for scheduled amortizations and interest payments, net
consolidated debt is projected to rise in real terms in the medium term, as the state investment
program is implemented, after which it is expected to fall until 2020 (Figure A3.14). As a share
of net current revenue, net consolidated debt and debt service are projected to remain within the
Fiscal Responsibility Law limits set by the federal Government. It is important to note that this
baseline scenario does not include financing of planned investments after 2013, which will
probably require additional new borrowing. However, given that Pernambuco’s debt level as a
percentage of NCR is well below the 200 percent limit set in the LRF, this should not affect its


                                                  86
projected long-term fiscal sustainability. Debt service payments would remain below 10 percent
throughout the forecast period, peaking at about 7.6 percent of net current revenue in 2013, and
declining thereafter to 4.6 percent in 2020. Personnel costs are expected to stay below 53 percent
of net current revenue for the entire period of projection. (Table A3.9).

According to the GFS classification methodology, net current revenues include capital transfer
revenues (as reported by the Brazilian statistics), which are otherwise excluded in the Brazilian
Central Bank’s definition of current revenues. The baseline fiscal projection results for 2010 to
2016 are presented in Table A3.10, while the assumptions used for the projections are found in
Table A3.12.

Risk Analysis

22.     The risk analysis assesses the impact of uncertainty surrounding fundamental variables
for Pernambuco’s fiscal outlook. The main risks that could lead to a deterioration in the State’s
fiscal balances are related to: (i) fluctuations in macroeconomic variables; and (ii) uncertainty
surrounding FPE transfers stemming from federal reform. The objective of the analysis is to
establish whether any given shock would have a negative impact on revenues or increase
expenditures and compromise fiscal and debt sustainability.

Fluctuations in Macroeconomic Variables

23.    The analysis examines the impact of fluctuations in key macroeconomic variables (the
exchange rate, IPCA and Prices General Index (IGP) inflation, real GDP growth, and personnel
growth) on projected fiscal and debt aggregates. Alternative pessimistic scenarios were modeled
for each of the variables, the combined outcome of which produces the joint shock analyzed,
painting a highly pessimistic scenario for the macroeconomic environment.

24.     The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the alternative scenarios are found in Table
A3.13 and are explained as follows. The baseline assumptions for the variables are based upon
forecasts by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and the
IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO). In particular, estimates for the exchange rate, IPCA and
IGP inflation were taken from the BACEN Focus Report (as of October 21, 2011) for 2010 and
2011, and from the EIU for 2012-15, and were assumed to remain at their 2015 levels for 2016-
20. Estimates for the real GDP growth were taken from the WEO (September 2011) for 2010 and
2015, and were assumed to remain at their 2015 levels for 2016-20. The alternative scenario
assumptions were the baseline level less (or plus) 0.5 times the variable’s standard deviation over
2000-09 for the respective lower (or higher) scenarios for the GDP growth and inflation
variables. The alternative exchange rate assumed an additional 20 percent depreciation rate each
year. Estimates for personnel growth were provided by SEFAZ, and the alternative was taken to
be 1 percent higher.



                                                           90
25.    The projected fiscal and debt trajectories are deemed sustainable in the scenario of joint
adverse macroeconomic shocks. While this pessimistic scenario causes a rise in both revenues
and expenditures in nominal terms (due to the inflation component), in real terms both fall.
Lower growth rates have large negative impacts on current revenues, which fall by more than
current expenditures. The higher personnel growth rate is reflected in higher employee
compensation expenses, and interest payments rise due to the deteriorating exchange rate.
Nonetheless, despite these adverse effects, both the primary and overall balances remain positive
throughout the period, and there is fiscal room for investment expansion. The ratio of debt to net
current revenue falls to 22.1 percent of NCR by 2020, compared to 20 percent of NCR in the
baseline (Figure A3.15).

Uncertain FPE

26.     This analysis models the risks associated with uncertain FPE transfers to the State. FPE
transfers represented 27 percent of Pernambuco’s net current revenues in 2010. Yet, a large
uncertainty surrounds the future of this revenue source given possible changes to the sharing rule



                                               91
applied in the determination of state-specific transfer amounts. An alternative scenario is
analyzed which assumes a 20 percent reduction in the sharing rule percentage from the baseline
level, applied in 2013 (Figure A3.16).

ANNEX 4: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (PSIA)

1.      A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) was undertaken during the period
October-November, 2011 with the purpose of exploring the potential distributional effects
of policies to be implemented by the Government of the State of Pernambuco. The report
comprises two parts. Part one provides the socioeconomic context, through an analysis of the
demographic, labor market, economic, social, inequality and poverty dimensions of the State of
Pernambuco. It uses the most updated secondary information from the main statistical sources in
the country. The focus was more on cross-section than on time-series analysis although both
methods were used. Thus, an overview of the State’s socioeconomic conditions was provided as
a background to assess the likely impacts of those DPL supported policies on poverty and
inequality. Part two contains the stakeholders’ perspectives on each one of the policies to be
undertaken by the State with Bank support. This data was compiled through interviews with key
stakeholders. The issues and questions approached were based on PSIA methodology that
attempts to identify who wins and loses with the policy, why this is so, and how it affects policy
outcomes. It also evaluates concerns and possible risks stemming from implementation of the
policies, and tries to pinpoint the channels by which benefits and costs are transmitted to
stakeholders. The overarching goal of these exercises is to assess whether the proposed policies
increase the wellbeing of the State’s population, promote equitable growth across regions and
social groups, and are, at their core, pro-poor.

2.      The proposed operation is expected to have a positive effect on poverty reduction
and social equity, especially in the interior of the State of Pernambuco. The policy priorities
for the period 2011-2014 are particularly concerned with a more equitable distribution of the
benefits of growth across the State’s twelve development regions. This implies incorporating
social groups that did not benefit from the higher growth path of recent years. Thus, the DPL
supported policies are focused on strengthening progressive policies that contribute to more
equitable development across social groups and regions. This section of the report presents a
thorough analysis of the potential impacts of the supported policies on poverty and equity.

3.      Pernambuco poverty and socioeconomic disparities are marked traits of its history.
Despite notable advances in recent years Pernambuco still faces sharp inequalities and
widespread poverty. Furthermore, within Brazil, Pernambuco still lags in many key social and
economic dimensions. The State’s Government is conceiving and applying policies to reduce its
lag with respect to the country as a whole, and to narrow inequalities within regions and among
social groups. The DPL supported policies are targeted to promote a more equitable growth by
converting economic expansion into widespread and improved wellbeing.

4.     Interviews with key stakeholders concluded that the DPL supported policies (to
provide quality education, improve the reliability and security of water supplies,
strengthen disaster and risk management, upgrade human capital, strengthen gender
equity, support small urban and rural producers, and increase public administration
capacity) would have positive distributional impacts across regions and social groups, thus
contributing to lower poverty and inequality. Interviews sought stakeholders’ perceptions of
the potential distributional impacts of the DPL supported policies, especially on poverty and
inequality. They also elicited interviewees’ primary concerns about the main risks associated


                                               93
with the implementation of policies supported by the DPL. Stakeholders interviewed comprised:
(i) policy formulators; (ii) policy executioners; (iii) school teachers; (iv) students; (v) school
heads; (vi) students’ parents/families; (vii) NGO representatives; (viii) scholars; (ix) managers;
(x) members of state councils; and (xi) community leaders. Given the content of some of the
DPL supported policies that were related to issues within the Government itself, additional
stakeholders were sought from the government apparatus and society at large. In these cases,
theoretical and analytical skills were used to trace all effects down.

Policy Area 1: Improving the Quality of Life of Pernambucanos

Sub-Component 1.1: Provide Quality Education.

5.     The full school day (40 hours per week in integral schools) or expanded school hours
(32 hours per week in semi-integral schools) will have a positive impact on reducing
poverty and inequality, because priority is being given to schools located in relatively
backward and poorer municipalities and suburbs, as shown in the specific legal documents.
Expansion in the number of school hours targets municipalities with lower Human Development
Indexes in the State, as well as suburban areas within cities situated in the MAR. The criterion to
create extended instruction hours is the presence of poverty, violence, and weak school
performance. To be accepted by a reference school (full day or extended hours) a student must
come from the public school system. Other requirements apply. A pattern defines the number of
vacancies and a parameter determines that for every thirty thousand inhabitants a school should
be available. In secondary schools with extended hours of instruction, the curriculum is adapted
to prepare students both for access to higher education and for the labor market, while in
secondary fulltime technical schools the major curriculum component targets the labor market.
Teachers in both systems are dedicated exclusively to the school they have been assigned to
work in. Currently there are 59 semi-integral schools in the MAR and 49 in the interior of the
State, and 65 integral schools. In 2011, the Government authorized the functioning of 9
additional integral schools and 14 additional semi-integral schools.

6.      For students, this policy will widen access to quality secondary education and
improve chances of access to university education, which has been lower for poor youth
coming from the public school system. Better education and qualifications will also increase
students’ employability and income prospects when they decide to enter the labor market. Higher
returns to human capital will broaden access to goods and services that may lead to improved
wellbeing. The feeling of belonging to a respected academic community also increases the
students’ self-esteem and leads to social recognition. In 2010, reference schools performed better
(3.56) in IDEPE test scores than regular schools (2.09).

7.      The extended hours of school may also reduce youth involvement with drugs
(trafficking and consumption), violence, and other illegal activities, as well as potentially
reducing unwanted teenage pregnancy, particularly in the poorest municipalities and
suburbs. Extended hours have potential poverty and social impacts on parents and students’
families at large. One potential impact is the increase of inter-generational social and economic
mobility, which starts by improving the current chances for social and economic upward
mobility for students of poor families. Families’ prospective wellbeing is also increased through



                                                94
higher potential family labor force participation, which raises permanent family income and
thereby widens access to goods and services. In addition, increased school hours can reduce the
probability that young people become involved in drug trafficking or consumption, street
violence, or early pregnancy—all situations that impose high emotional and social costs on the
family unit. Finally, family members’ enrollment in good and valued schools improves self-
esteem and social status in the local community.

8.      Teachers are also expected to benefit because they earn more for working longer
hours and are granted a bonus conditional on results, based on schools’ test scores
(IDEPE). Interviews with teachers and parents indicated a unanimous belief that longer school
hours and the exclusive dedication of one teacher to one school provided better guidance to
students. Students argued that it allowed for more academic interaction and created a stronger
esprit de corps. Stronger ties between students and teachers could also bring teachers closer to
students’ parents and make them more knowledgeable about the problems students face at home.
In turn, this greater closeness between teachers and local families could raise teachers’ social
status in the local community, improving their self-esteem, and stimulating their commitment to
the policy’s overarching goals. Teachers unions, which are usually resilient to this kind of policy,
stand to reap rewards because the reforms reinforce their classical discourse on the need to
improve the quality of public education, working conditions, and pay. In addition, the union
stands to gain in membership, since the Government will need to hire more teachers to achieve
the policy objectives during the period 2011-2014. This additional employment and wage
income (including more bonuses) can be expected to result in increased demand for goods and
services in the local economies.

9.     The community at large is expected to benefit from the policy, since it upgrades its
social and intellectual capital, provides a better quality labor supply to meet local labor
market needs, and is likely to reduce the number of young people involved in drugs and
crime. Thus, policies are progressive and promote equitable growth. Strong community support
is expected to arise from the collective awareness that the reform enhances intellectual capital,
economic opportunities, and community prestige.

10.    Primary concerns and perceived risks. For secondary students there is an
opportunity cost of a (typically low paid) job in the local labor market. This poses the risk
that students get a job to become less dependent on parents’ income, especially if the
student’s family is poor. Interviews revealed a temporary resistance of first year students to the
extended school hour policy, due to a cultural bias that values teenagers’ income independence.
However, by continuing to attend school and by abiding by its academic rules, students came to
appreciate that it generated economic opportunities for upward social mobility and higher status.

11.     Students of poverty stricken families face higher risk of dropout due to critical
survival needs that encourage young people into either the labor market or illegal activities.
Some families stated during interviews that they either pressed students to drop out of school or
to reduce their hours of attendance so that they could get a job, in order to contribute to
household incomes. The majority of families, however, have encouraged young students to stay
in school, due to the awareness that this policy would enhance family’s economic, social, and
cultural opportunities. There was also a family awareness that extended school hours would help



                                                95
families to keep their youth away from drugs, violence and unwanted pregnancy. Nevertheless,
schools’ heads stated great difficulties in attracting parents to the regular school meetings. with
the majority of attendees being mothers or grandmothers.

12.      Within the teaching community there is a potential risk stemming from lack of
motivation and belief in the policy’s goals, strategies and instruments, which could
compromise the final outcome by undermining the quality of education. However, the
interviews indicated that teachers currently support the policies. The teachers union has the
potential power to block initiatives and create difficulties for the advancement of the policy. But
despite some criticisms, the union currently perceives that the policy will strengthen the
institution and reinforce its agenda.

Sub- Component 1.2: Improve Water Security and Increase Reliability of Water Supply

13.    The water resources management policy actions supported by the DPL, focused on
the improvement of water security and reliability of supply, can also be expected to have a
net positive impact from a distributional perspective. The poor population suffers the most
from water scarcity and from intermittent water supply. Poor people are also most vulnerable to
heavy rainfall and flooding since they are disproportionately concentrated in hills, lowlands, and
river margins that are more prone to this kind of natural disaster.

14.    For the poor population, unreliable water is related to higher morbidity, especially
among infants and children. Since water is intermittent, the poor population usually saves
water in (often open) devices that are efficient vehicles for transmitting diseases of hydro origin,
such as dengue. Saved water may also be contaminated by organic or inorganic materials,
making it potentially unsafe for drinking, washing, bathing, cooking, and other household uses.
Unreliable water supply also affects groups in the middle and upper social classes. These
groups, nevertheless, obtain water from wells or private suppliers—an option that is not
economically feasible for most of the poor.

15.     The MAR experienced years of water rationing. Recently, the Pirapama system started
to pump water to those areas previously subjected to intermittent supply.39 Rationing also affects
the interior, especially in the semi-arid region. In the rural areas of the interior where the
majority of the population is poor, the problem is aggravated during periods of irregular rainfall
or severe drought.

16.     The MAR and the regions closer to seashore (North and South ―Matas‖) are
subjected to heavy rain and the risk of severe flooding. The poor urban populations who live
in risky areas suffer the most, especially those who reside along the river margins that cross
some of the most important cities of the territory. In 2010, flooding caused devastation to these
areas, especially in the south of the State. There were avoidable deaths and casualties, in addition
to severe damage to the social and economic infrastructure, commerce, industry, and private
property. The reconstruction plan is still under way and has been costly to the State Treasury.
One of the lessons learnt by the Government is that prevention programs cost less than disaster

39
  In Metropolitan Recife, increased water pressure on old pipes caused many to burst. The number of leakages rose
leading to additional wastes of clean water.


                                                       96
response and can protect lives and property. Recently created, the State Water and Climate
Agency (APAC) is responsible for implementing and regulating the hydro resources of the State,
except those related to the construction of dams and reservoirs.

17.    The new framework and the creation of APAC will favor poor urban communities
and rural areas. Those poorer areas have been traditionally affected by unreliability of water
supply and water related natural disasters. This policy response was elaborated through
consultation with stakeholders at the State and municipal levels.

18.      Expected Benefits. Improved access to regular safer water will benefit urban
populations, particular the poorest, whose access is limited due to poor water availability
or the high cost of private suppliers. A reduction in infant disease/mortality and general
morbidity can be expected as a result of improvements in the sanitary conditions of poor
households. Under the new policy, the urban poor might spend less on water despite higher
consumption, because official tariffs are lower than the prices charged by private suppliers. If
this is so, more income will be left for other expenses, a discrete but meaningful gain for poor
wage earners. Regular water availability may have an indirect effect on housing assets, by
boosting the market value of homes that were previously without a regular supply.40

19.     Better risk prevention can be expected to improve the quality of urban life.
Municipal master plans that reserve high risk sites for social and leisure activities, as opposed to
housing and commerce, can help to prevent the human, economic, and social costs of
displacement of urban populations that have settled in lowlands, hills, river margins, and other
vulnerable areas.

20.     For urban businesses, regular water supply increases productivity and profits in
activities where water is a critical input, such as the beverage industry and restaurants.
This improves product quality, making them safer for human consumption and reduces
overheads (since water acquired from private suppliers is more expensive). Furthermore, regular
and safe water supply can lead to the growth of enterprises in which water is a critical input—
whether the expansion of existing businesses, or the creation of new enterprises.

21.    For farmers, especially poorer farmers located in the arid backlands of the State,
increased and regular water supply reduces the adverse economic effects (such as poor
harvests and herd losses) stemming from irregular rainfall and severe droughts. In sectors
where water is a critical input to sustainable productive process, policy implementation and
improved regulation may warrant water supply for the production of food crops and for the
export-oriented agro-industrial businesses located in the interior of the State. For poor farmers
engaged in family agriculture, predictability and regular water supply helps to prevent price
collapses as a result of natural disasters. This helps to assure food supply for self-consumption
and for the market, sustains income and employment, and potentially increases the market value
of otherwise dry and unproductive land. In the rural sector, there is also a time-use gain for the


40
  A house with water can be expected to be worth more than a house without it, as confirmed by interviews for the
PSIA.



                                                       97
poor, especially women, who typically spend non-negligible amounts of time collecting and
transporting water.

22.     There are also possible losers resulting from this policy. Private suppliers will face a
declining demand for water trucks that supplied households, farmers, and firms as a result
of intermittent water availability. Narrower water markets for private suppliers will mean that
they will likely face tougher price competition and reduced profits, which might lead to layoffs.
Market value of private suppliers may decrease as a result of better service delivery by the public
sector.

23.     Primary Concerns and Perceived Risks. Alternative suppliers may oppose this policy
since the increase in the efficiency of the system could reduce business for them. Indeed,
poorer people tend to buy water from alternative suppliers whenever the system does not satisfy
their demand. Data shows that they do so at higher prices than the prices that would eventually
be charged under the new system. There is thus a surplus appropriated by the poorest.

24.     This policy is implemented in close coordination with the municipal governments,
especially with civil defense. Thus, the role of municipal government is essential to the
sustainability and long-run success of the policy. A fear of short-run losses as a result of
displacement from risky areas may lead to resistance from the population. There is a risk
that after the occurrence of a natural disaster the population would return to occupy the areas
they were displaced from. Municipal governments would have to prevent this, in addition to
allocating these sites to alternative uses. Some of those interviewed voiced a concern that
populations would return to vulnerable areas and that municipal governments would not follow
through with adequate urban planning.

25.     There is also a risk that the civil defense of the municipal governments, especially in
those municipalities with a higher than average risk of recurrent natural disasters, might
not be adequately prepared to deal with crisis situations where readiness is essential to avoid
further losses and damages to households, infrastructure, and productive activities.

26.     The rural population may also lose some natural assets such as waterfalls as a result
of interventions designed to stabilize water supply to the urban and rural communities. This
possible loss does not threaten the successful implementation of the policy.

Sub-Component 1.3: Improve Disaster and Risk Management

27.      The risk and disaster management policies supported under the operation can be
expected to have a large pro-equity impact. Sub-component 1.2—improving the security and
reliability of the water supply—is strongly connected to this disaster and risk management sub-
component. The poorer population should benefit the most from these policies since it is
disproportionately concentrated in the most vulnerable areas of the State, especially in the three
development regions comprising the coastal areas. Interviews and data show that the poorest
social groups are hardest hit by natural disasters, since wealthier households can afford to both
live in relatively protected areas and protect their lives and property from potential losses.




                                                98
Notwithstanding this fact, the State, however, has the constitutional duty to protect all members
of society irrespective of social class—an implicit goal of the policies supported by the DPL.

28.     Disaster and risk management policies are also expected to reduce the economic and
human costs associated with population displacement in the semi-arid zone of the State.
The same level of exposure tends to result in higher relative losses for poorer populations,
particularly with regard to tangible and non-tangible assets. Losses can carry potentially long-run
implications, such as those associated with the interruption of schooling or health services. As
the PSIA shows, the map of disaster risk exposure overlaps with the poverty map. Thus, reducing
the magnitude of the impact of extreme events, through the policies supported by the operation,
has clear pro-poor implications.

29.     This policy has been conceived and implemented in close connection with municipal
governments. Full implementation requires both vertical coordination among the three
levels of government and horizontal coordination among secretariats and agencies of the
State Government. All relevant stakeholders were consulted, especially at the municipality
level, where local civil defense represents the crucial first line of response.

30.     Expected Benefits. For the urban population, especially the poorer, improved
disaster and risk management policies can ensure increased survival and fewer casualties
resulting from natural disasters. It can also lower the probability of contracting natural
disaster-related diseases, in particular, water-borne illnesses. In addition, it can reduce the losses
to household assets.

31.     One of the most important gains of this policy is not related to ex-post losses but to
the forging of increased community awareness of risk. Higher levels of community
consciousness can enable risk prevention through improved ex-ante measures. In the long run, a
culture of risk awareness enables the incorporation of robust infrastructure and appropriate land
use in urban planning, thereby lowering the human, economic, and social costs of unsuitable land
use.

32.    For rural communities, especially those in the semi-arid areas that are more likely
to face water scarcity, this policy aims to provide improved access to water and social
protection in the occurrence of droughts, thereby reducing the vulnerability of the rural
poor to adverse climate events.

33.     Urban economic activity is likely to benefit from early warning systems and other
preventive measures that reduce losses to goods, facilities, stocks, machinery, and
employment resulting from natural disasters. This will help to preclude deep damages to the
local economy and allow for faster economic recovery of disaster stricken areas. In emergency
situations caused by floods or droughts, risk management policies provide coordinated and
immediate assistance to rural or urban communities through public service delivery of such
essentials as vaccinations and food. Interviews indicated that (in the light of recent experiences
of drought and floods) such policies have the support of associations of rural producers, rural
workers, unions, and NGOs.




                                                 99
34.     Primary Concerns and Perceived Risks. One perceived risk is that if municipal
governments do not play their part, the community may not get the full benefits of the risk
management policies. Municipalities may fail, for instance, to preclude the return of households
and businesses to risky sites after the occurrence of natural disasters. Civil society engagement
will help to hold municipal governments to account for delivery of their responsibilities with
regard to risk management.

Policy Area 2: New Economy—Expanding Opportunities for Pernambucanos
Sub-Component 2.1: Promote Job Creation through the Development of Human Capital

35.     The promotion of economic development and job creation, through the policies
supported by the DPL, is expected to be positive for all stakeholders. The labor market in
Pernambuco is tight. Unemployment is falling, job creation is growing fast, and labor earnings
are rising. Skilled and semi-skilled labor are becoming scarce, especially in the construction
business, as a consequence of huge investments in infrastructure, productive activities and
housing. In the next five to seven years, public and private investors are committed to invest
around R$53 billion in the State. Out of this total, 77.4 percent will be located in the MAR and
three-fourths are in the industrial sector.

36.    The State has not been able to supply the manpower demanded. Many workers are
coming from other states and even from abroad. Pernambuco’s labor market profile is
characterized by low schooling and low skills. This is due to historically poor (although currently
improving) educational records, both in elementary and secondary schools. At 18 percent
(according to the 2010 census), illiteracy is high, and 50.2 percent of people aged 10 and over
(according to the 2009 PNAD) have between one and eight years of schooling.

37.     This mismatch between supply and demand means that many Pernambucanos are
unprepared to take advantage of the jobs offered by the State’s emerging economy. This
also means that a non-negligible share of GDP is not transformed into income for those
living within the State’s territory. Interiorization and internalization represent important tactics
to transform economic progress into increasing wellbeing for all Pernambucanos.

38.     The State’s economy is currently experiencing a boom in the civil construction
business, with a significant portion of new demand for labor concentrated in this sector.
However, as investments mature, labor demand will shift to occupations typical of a modern
industrial economy (for example, oil and gas, petrochemicals, shipbuilding, and
pharmaceuticals). The State’s labor force must be better qualified to take jobs in these emerging
sectors.

39.    Preparing Pernambucanos to take full advantage of the new opportunities in a
changing and modernizing economy will help to promote equitable, pro-poor growth. The
Government has taken measures to match human capital to local job market demand, with an
emphasis on professional education. Accordingly, it has transformed six regular secondary state
schools into schools of professional education. In addition, the State Government has created a
Labor Secretariat to conceive and implement policies to boost human capital within the State. In




                                                100
interviews, stakeholders indicated their belief that the policies supported by the DPL will have a
progressive impact, benefiting the poor.

40.     Expected Benefits. Students of professional education will get improved skills for
local labor market entry, broadening their employability and increasing their access to
higher education. Either outcome leads to higher income prospects and broad access to good
and services. Besides, upgraded professional students are likely to be kept away from drugs,
violence and early pregnancy. Furthermore, such polices raise their self-esteem and prestige
within the local community.

41.      For the labor force at large, these policies are expected to increase employability,
and reduce long-term unemployment and informality that result from lower schooling and
skills. In addition, they may raise labor earnings, thus contributing to reduced poverty and
inequality. Increased human capital is an input for higher firm productivity that may also be
appropriated by workers if it grows faster than real wages. These policies both increase the
supply of local qualified labor to firms, eliminating the marginal cost of importing qualified
workers from elsewhere and reduce cannibalization among firms in their eager search for
workers to fulfill open job vacancies. Furthermore, such policies internalize income by providing
qualified labor to the new productive chains, and reduce urban violence and drug addiction by
creating sound economic and social alternatives.

42.     As positive social and economic externalities resulting from these government
policies reach the local communities, especially in the interior, the policies can be expected
to attract the support of civil society, since they are convergent with many of these
organizations’ goals. The PSIA analysis thus concludes that labor unions, entrepreneurs
associations, families, and NGOs are all likely to effectively support these policies.

43.     Primary Concerns and Perceived Risks. Stakeholders identified three relatively
minor concerns and risks. The first is that students may criticize or oppose this policy if
secondary professional schools do not prepare them equally well to access colleges and
universities, a valued cultural asset. The second concern is that if trained workers do not get a job
as a result of labor market mismatches, they might blame the policy for their failure. The third is
that a scarcity of instructors might result in a failure to meet demands: instructors will have to
train other instructors; and still the number of available instructors may not meet the anticipated
demand.

Sub-Component 2.2: Increase Opportunities through Greater Gender Equity.

44.     The gender policies supported by this DPL, including the support to the
establishment of the Secretaria das Politicas Mulheres (SecMulher) as a permanent
secretariat and the implementation of partnerships with other sectors, are estimated to
enhance economic, social and cultural opportunities for women in a non-regressive way.

45.     Despite efforts to increase endowments for women in Pernambuco, serious problems
persist. For example, maternal mortality remains very high with a rate of 76.4 deaths per
100,000 live births, based on 2008 data. Women are overrepresented among the unemployed,



                                                101
have a lower labor force participation rate (44.3 percent) and lower share in the total employment
(43.9 percent) compared to men, and are heads of households in increasing numbers. Women
also have substantial income gaps with respect to men in the state’s labor market (1.60). Women
usually have greater schooling years (6.07), but social and economic adverse mechanisms
impede them from transforming this advantage into better jobs and higher incomes. Teenage
pregnancy remains a serious problem in Pernambuco. Evidence suggests that pregnancy before
the age of 20 has negative implications for mothers and their children’s future opportunities in
society.41 In Pernambuco, the pregnancy rate for girls aged 15 to 19 was 74.4 per 1,000 live
births, which ranks as the fourth highest in northeast Brazil. At between 6 and 7 per 100,000, the
female homicide rate in Pernambuco remained high throughout the past decade. Thirty-four
percent of females in Pernambuco reported having experienced physical violence, while 14
percent reported sexual violence at least once in their life (WHO, 2005). Unemployment and
lower income makes women more dependent on their male partners and increases the probability
of being subjected to domestic violence. Women are also more vulnerable to sexual assaults and
few seek assistance either for fear or for lack of awareness of their rights.

46.    Being of afro-descent, among other attributes, puts women at an even greater
disadvantage. If a woman is illiterate, afro-descendent, head of household with small children,
works in family agriculture, and lives in the semi-arid interior of the State, she will have a very
high probability of being extremely poor in addition to being overexposed to risky situations.

47.     While the State has maintained a Special Secretariat for Women since 2007, its role
and impact has been limited to only two major areas of activity: (i) rights-based training of
women; and, (ii) job training in non-traditional sectors for women in rural areas of the
State through the Chapeu de Palha program. The State Government has strengthened its
institutional framework aimed at promoting gender equality by creating a permanent
Women’s Secretariat to replace the former temporary Secretariat, as evidenced in the legal
documents. The permanent Women’s Secretariat (SecMulher) is able to advance more
vigorously gender mainstreaming in the public sector, while expanding its focus to other pressing
gender issues in Pernambuco—namely, violence against females, gender education, and health.

48.     The SecMulher aims at the socio-political strengthening of disadvantaged women,
by reducing employment and income gaps, increasing human capital, improving awareness
of their rights, and helping them to obtain the necessary documentation to enter the formal
labor market. Its policies are linked to a network of other government agencies and institutions
(police stations, hospitals, schools, shelters). Policies were elaborated in consultation with major
stakeholders.

49.     Reducing and preventing violence against women is also an important area of focus
for SecMulher. Pernambuco currently has five shelters to assist women victims of violence.
The State is planning to open new ―model‖ shelters that will provide additional services and
attention to victims.


41
  Teenage pregnancy is often correlated with higher poverty rates and lower economic opportunities of the mother,
as well as lower educational outcomes of the child. However there is little empirical evidence on whether these
correlations represent causal links or the direction of any causality.


                                                      102
50.     The SecMulher is planning to accelerate the implementation of municipal entities to
facilitate the articulation of policies and programs with a gender perspective, as well as
training staff from municipal secretariats on gender issues. The SecMulher plans to open 30
new entities—currently they have 111—in order to cover all the 185 municipalities in
Pernambuco by 2015.

51.     These policies have a pro-poor tendency because they seek to reduce poverty,
promote gender equity, and increase women’s opportunities through better qualification
for the labor market, social protection, and improved citizenship.

52.     Expected Benefits. Policies are expected to produce the following benefits and
results:
         Enhancing economic, social, and cultural opportunities for women, thus reducing
           poverty and gender inequality.
         Narrowing wage and occupational gaps in women’s work in relation to men, thus
           reducing labor market discrimination.
         Promoting women’s citizenship and strengthening their self-esteem, especially in
           adverse social and economic situations, thus increasing their empowerment.
         Protecting women who are victims of domestic or street violence, thus reducing
           emotional and psychological costs.
         Raising women’s awareness of their rights and providing them with the necessary
           documentation to secure social protection and better insertion in the local economy,
           thus opening up new opportunities.

53.     These policies also imply substantial gains for society at large. A narrower gender
gap should result in lower income inequality and lower poverty. SecMulher’s emphasis on
municipalities in the interior of the State will lessen cultural biases in favor of men in
regions where gender prejudices are traditionally stronger. These policies also create the
social conditions to reduce violence against women and increase broader awareness of women’s
rights. Women are becoming increasingly organized and are capable of reinforcing the policies
of SecMulher by obtaining political support from associations and NGOs with similar agenda.

54.      Primary Concerns and Perceived risks. A major concern is related to the difficulties
women face when confronted with discrimination and violence, especially sexual assaults.
Feelings of fear and guilt can inhibit women from seeking assistance and obtaining protection.
However, this policy aims to confront this problem by promoting women’s awareness of their
rights so as to help overcome feelings of self-blame that result from gender-based violence and
discrimination. Since the policies require vertical coordination as well as horizontal coordination,
interviews reflected a concern that the National Secretariat for Women—the federal level
institution in charge of national gender policies—might be extinguished.

Sub-Component 2.3: Promote Economic Development through Support to SMEs and Rural
Producers

55.   Description and Challenges: Economic growth in Pernambuco is highly
concentrated geographically, and has a weak link to local suppliers. Currently, 74 percent of


                                                103
the GDP of the State is produced in the coastal area, in an area that encompasses 17 percent of
the State territory and 57 percent of the population. The sectoral composition of the economy
favors demand for relatively unskilled labor and shows low productivity growth. The strategy to
attract investment to the Suape port complex has been accompanied by a definition of strategic
sectors that will be supported and eventually linked to the main growth drivers. In following this
strategy, the expectation is to maintain growth above the national average, increasing the state’s
share in national GDP, and reducing its gap in relation to the national per capita GDP.

56.    A State Development Agency is being established to foster economic and social
development by supporting micro, small and medium-size enterprises and rural producers
in local production chain. The State of Pernambuco Development Agency (Agência de
Fomento do Estado de Pernambuco, or AGEFEPE) has received an initial capital of R$30
million. Its mandate covers a wide range of actions, all related to the provision of support for
entrepreneurship, with a specific gender component. It focuses on value chains that can supply
large private firms and government, strengthening also access to technology, quality control
protocols, commercialization networks, and managerial training.

57.     Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) have a significant weight in the
economy of Pernambuco. In 2009, micro and small firms alone (i.e. not including medium
sized firms) accounted for 32.2 percent of employment, 22.6 percent of wage income, and
84.8 percent of the total number of formal enterprises in the State. However, they face
many difficulties in accessing credit and obtaining support for their production initiatives.
Most of these enterprises are located in the urban settings, especially in the commerce and
service sectors, producing and trading goods and non-tangibles for local markets. There are weak
input-output relations between these firms and the larger ones operating in the State. Typically,
productivity is low and profit margins are small. These firms compete fiercely with each other to
keep their local markets and, in sectors such as commerce, are frequently wiped out of business
by larger firms. Thus, these firms are weak and vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and
competition.

58.     The new incoming large industries will open up investments opportunities as a
result of forward and backward linkages. New productive chains can be taken up by local
entrepreneurs, provided they are competitive. MSME firms will have to innovate, adopt new
technologies, set up commercialization chains and update management models so as to produce
high quality inputs to supply the new large undertakings at competitive prices.

59.    Small rural producers are usually poor, devoted to family agriculture, and
vulnerable to price fluctuations and to climate related events, especially droughts. Some
produce for the market. They have limited access to rural credit through the National Program to
Strengthen Family Agriculture and Bank of Northeast Brazil. Their insertion into the local
productive arrangements is one of AGEFEPE’s main objectives.

60.    AGEFEPE will facilitate access to federal funds devoted to similar objectives. Once
the agency is in full operation, it will be able to command a portfolio ten times greater than its
own capital, with minimum risk for the State. Thus, the structure and financing of the agency




                                               104
does not represent a fiscal burden. The creation of the Development Agency is aligned with the
objectives of generating more jobs, and of better distributing the benefits of growth.

61.    Policies fostering MSME development would have a positive effect from the
distributional perspective, by reducing bankruptcies, broadening commercial chains,
enlarging profits, creating jobs and increasing wage income. Thus, such policies tend to be
progressive and pro-poor.

62.     Expected Benefits. Given the nature of the priority sectors, the strategy implies an
important growth in the demand for technical (medium skill) workers, and thus a
reduction of unemployment and poverty in the interior of the State. A specific line of
activity is devoted to supporting gender-related priorities: providing services to women
entrepreneurs under competitive conditions; and emphasizing support in sectors that generate
demand for female labor. The policy’s both aims at the ―interiorization‖ of development and
internalization of its benefits through support for micro, small and medium sized enterprises and
small rural producers.

63.     With respect to MSMEs, the new agency will support firms to fill gaps in the
productive chains of the State economy. Local firms would then supply inputs to the larger
ones already in operation or to those that are coming to settle in the State. The agency would also
provide stimulus for MSMEs to supply goods and services to the local governments. In both
situations, the agency’s role is to support and provide incentives for promoting entrepreneurship
among MSMEs. However, providing lower cost credit is the final stage because it is conditional
on measures to improve management, product quality, and competitiveness.

64.      For small rural producers, this policy would facilitate access to comparatively
cheaper credit either supplied by federal development and commercial banks or by the
agency itself. Usually small rural producers are family-based undertakings located at the bottom
of the socioeconomic scale. AGEFEPE would foster the growth of local employment and
income, providing the basis for an expanded local market, especially in the interior. By
prioritizing the interior of the State and some disadvantaged social groups, this policy reduces
rural-urban and metropolitan-interior gaps, and promotes equitable growth and a fairer
distribution of the benefits of development.

65.     Micro, small and mid-sized enterprises associations support this policy because it
enhances economic opportunities for all of them. The group has political voice (Small and
Medium Enterprise Forum) and leverage to hold both the executive and the legislative branches
of the State Government to account for the policy’s sustainability and effectiveness. In addition,
small rural producers associations scattered in the interior of the State would fully support this
policy due to its emphasis on increasing income and job creation jobs in the most backward
regions of the State.

66.    Primary Concerns and Perceived Risks. The risks to AGEFEPE are similar to those
faced by development banks. The agency is supposed to play a modest role in comparison with
the former Development Bank of Pernambuco (Bandepe) that was privatized in 1998. However,
once credit operations are realized, there are always market risks as well as default risks that



                                               105
should be minimized by the rules and constraints set by Brazil’s Central Bank, which issued the
authorization for the agency to operate. The major risk according to some stakeholders is that the
institution may be headed by a politician instead of a technocrat. There is consensus that the
agency must be led by a professional, experienced in the promotion of MSMEs. There is also a
concern that the demand for credit will be much greater than the initial capital endowment of
R$30 million would allow. However, AGEFEPE will potentially be able to mobilize funds four
times greater than its initial endowment, and it is estimated that the State Government will
gradually increase its participation up to R$108 million by 2015.

Policy Area 3: Increase Public Administration Capacity for Generating Results for
Pernambucanos

67.      The Bank supports efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of public
management in Pernambuco as a means of enhancing equity and expanding opportunities
for all Pernambucanos. A more effective tax administration, which reduces evasion, will
increase the redistribution capacity of the State through the generation of more resources.
Improvements in budget management aim to allocate and execute more resources in the strategic
priorities identified by a participatory process. Finally, the consolidation of Pernambuco’s
Management Model, which strengthens the link between planning and budgeting, promotes a
participatory and coordinated approach, and monitors outputs and outcomes of policies and
programs, is crucial to increase the state’s effectiveness and efficiency.

Sub-Component 3.1: Improve ICMS Tax Revenues without Increasing Tax Burden on
Firms and Citizens, to Expand Fiscal Space for Investment and Promote Private Sector
Development

68.     The strengthening of the tax administration capacities of the State is based on
mechanisms that do not imply an increase of tax burden on the poor. The estimated increase
in revenues due to improved tax administration, spent equally across households, would have a
progressive effect. If the extra revenue is spent according to existing priorities, the pro-poor
effects would be substantial. Despite recent strong increase in revenues, there is considerable
space for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the ICMS tax administration, the main source
of revenue controlled by the State. Therefore, modernization and automation of processes are
needed to allow for a more efficient and effective control of ICMS compliance. The State needs
to build and mobilize public savings to finance its investment portfolio. To do so without
increasing the tax burden, the Government has to increase the effectiveness of its tax collection
system. The DPL supported policy would change tax procedures so as increase tax revenues.

69.     Two major efforts have been undertaken for strengthening controls of the ICMS
administration: (i) the implementation of the new fiscal control system, Sistema de
Escrituração Fiscal (SEF-2); and (ii) the implementation of automatic forecasting and tax
substitution system for selected products with the highest risk of evasion, representing close to
30 percent of ICMS tax collection.

70.   The implementation of SEF-2 will increase the quantity and quality of sales
information, substantially reducing fiscal evasion. The establishment of an automatic


                                               106
forecasting and tax substitution system for selected products will allow the State to perform
more strategic and effective physical controls to reduce evasion and promote voluntary tax
compliance.

Expected Benefits. For the Government, the main benefit will be to provide more resources
to finance priority policies, without creating a new tax or raising existing ones. For society
at large, new tax procedures create an environment less favorable to tax evasion. Society
will benefit if it gets better public services and more efficient public resource allocation as a
result of the improved tax procedures.

71.    Primary Concerns and Perceived Risks. Stakeholders perceive price increases as a
potential risk, since ICMS is an indirect tax. Producers depending on price elasticity for their
products and on market conditions might pass on heavier tax payments to consumers. The
adoption of these procedures was not and will not be preceded by consultations with tax payers.
There is a risk that tax payers might resist to the new procedures and regulations (for instance,
through increasing tax evasion) since they already perceive the tax burden as high.

Sub-Component 3.2: Improve Efficiency of Allocation and Execution of PPA and Budget
to Make Sure Public Expenditure Reflect Pernambuco’s Strategic Priorities

72.      Pernambuco has made important progress towards linking its planning and
budgeting processes. The State of Pernambuco moved from a fragmented budget planning
process that followed standard increases across the board and was based on inputs, to a new
Management Model. Since 2008, Pernambuco defined strategic priorities following the
Government’s plan and outcomes from participatory regional meetings. The strategic priorities
that result from this process inform the preparation of the PPA and budget formulation of
individual institutions on an annual basis, aligning the allocation of public expenditures to the
state’s policy priorities. By 2010, the planning process had fully incorporated the strategic
priorities into the budget formulation phase, but budget execution continued to follow in a
traditional input-based structure. The new regulation needed to eliminate the practice of making
changes on a daily basis as a result of poor budget formulation, while providing the Government
with space to address contingencies or changes in assumptions that occur during the fiscal year.

73.     The DPL supports the State’s actions to improve the efficiency of budget allocation
and execution. The Plano Plurianual (PPA) and budget are now being formulated and executed
to reflect Pernambuco’s strategic priorities. The participatory process for the PPA—identifying
strategic priorities and linked to budget formulation through the State’s Management Model—
has now been further improved through measures that contribute to ensuring resources are
effectively spent on the Government’s policy priorities.

74.     These measures increase the cost effectiveness of public spending. Increasing
efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public funds increases society’s wellbeing and it
has positive distributional effects.

75.     Expected Benefits. As public resource allocation becomes more effective and
efficient, better provision of public services at lower costs should result from the policies


                                              107
supported by this DPL. The State Government will benefit from the effective implementation
of its strategic priorities, from the increased efficiency in the allocation of public funding for
delivery of strategic projects and programs, and from reduced transaction costs within the State’s
public sector. Costs per unit of public services delivered will, in theory, be lowered, allowing for
more resources to be spent elsewhere, especially in programs and projects that may benefit the
poor and/or reduce inequality. These measures will also provide the Government with tools to
evaluate and monitor the implementation of strategic policies and upgrade the prestige of the
political elite, a valuable asset in open societies once it recognizes that governance is improved
and that it might be rewarded by the ballot.

76.     Primary Concerns and Perceived Risks. This policy offers no risk. There is usually
some internal resilience to changing budget and planning procedures if such changes demand
pro-active steps from well-rooted civil servants. Such resistances can be overcome through
positive systemic incentives.

Sub-Component 3.3: Improve Capacity to Plan and Implement Public Policies through
Institutionalization of Pernambuco’s Management Model

77.     Pernambuco has improved its capacity to plan and implement public policies by
taking initial steps for the institutionalization of the State’s Management Model.
Strengthening SEPLAG through the implementation of the planning, budgeting and
management career development and the creation of the Management Institute represents
important milestones towards this goal. The State also has taken steps toward the long-term
goal of developing its human resources so as to strengthen the public administration’s capacity to
deliver. The Management Institute will help maintain high quality management across the
administration and institutionalize performance management.

78.     Expected Benefits. For the Government, this reform will increase the quality of
public administration and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. By
increasing the productivity of civil servants it raises the quality of public expenditure and
improves the results of government actions. The Government considers the Management Model
a crucial tool for the successful implementation of strategic policies that are contained in the
PPA. For society at large, benefits will arise from the strengthened capacity of the State’s civil
service, leading to improvements in the delivery of strategic public services. There is broad
societal support for this measure due to its expected impact on the quality of public expenditure
and the provision of key public services.

79.    Conclusion. Given Pernambuco’s demographic, economic, labor market, inequality,
and poverty profile, and taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives on the anticipated
distributional impacts, benefits, and risks, it is concluded that the policies to be supported
by the DPL are expected to have positive, progressive and pro-poor impacts, thus
promoting more equitable growth in the State.

ANNEX 5: GENDER AND POVERTY IN PERNAMBUCO42

1.     Pernambuco, alongside Brazil as a whole, has made remarkable headways in terms
of growth, poverty reduction, and improved social indicators in the past decade. Data reveal
that Brazil’s poverty rate declined significantly, from 29.1 percent in 2006 to 22.1 percent in
2009.43 In Pernambuco, the reductions in the levels of poverty were even more striking than
those for the northeast and for Brazil as a whole, falling from 48.6.9 percent in 2006 to 38.3
percent in 2009.

2.      Reducing poverty and promoting equity is one of the central challenges for
Pernambuco. Indeed, despite this progress, poverty rates are still among the highest and
social indicators (in particular infant and maternal mortality, as well as illiteracy) are
among the lowest in Brazil. Thanks to improvements in healthcare access and sanitation, infant
mortality in Pernambuco has been declining since the 1990s from close to 60 deaths per 1,000
live births to 17.2 deaths per 1000 live births in 2009. However, Pernambuco’s average is still far
from the national average for 2009 (14.8 deaths per 1,000 live births) and slightly worse than the
average for the northeast region (17 deaths per 1,000 live births) (Figure A5.1).44 Furthermore,
maternal mortality rates have not shown any progress. After taking a path of decline in the late
1990s they started increasing again in 2005 to levels similar to those in the late 1990s (Figure
A5.1).

   This annex was prepared by Erik Alda (LCSPP) with valuable comments from Miriam Muller (LCSPP). It
attempts to shed light on basic questions about poverty in Pernambuco while trying to maintain a gender lens. This
note, however, does not address all the areas related to poverty because data for important correlates such as
voicelessness, powerlessness, and security are not available, so for quantitative analysis this note uses a constricted
definition of poverty as the having insufficient income, low levels of education, l o w l e v e l s o f employment,
poor access to public services, social assistance, and poor health (see Verner 2004).
43
   For the purposes of this analysis we use the World Bank 4USD/day moderate poverty line. As a result,
percentages may differ from those using Brazil’s official moderate poverty line. Unless otherwise specified, poverty
rates are for head of household.

3.       Adult illiteracy in Pernambuco declined alongside the headcount poverty and infant
mortality rates, demonstrating significant improvements in the past two decades. Reducing
illiteracy is central in the quest for poverty reduction and long-term sustainable development.
Thanks to continuous investments in education, Pernambuco reduced its illiteracy rates by ten
percentage points from 23.2 percent in 2006 to 21.5 percent in 2009. Illiteracy continues to drop,
albeit at a slower pace, declining from 23.2 percent in 2006 to 21.5 percent in 2009.
Furthermore, while this rate for Pernambuco is slightly better than the average of 23.7 percent
for the northeast, it is still lagging behind the average of Brazil as a whole (17.5 percent).

4.      Women constitute the majority in the overall population (51.9 percent) and the ratio
of women to men is higher in Pernambuco (1.07) than the national average (1.04). Women
prevail in the urban population (52.7 percent), while men constitute the majority in the rural
areas (51.4 percent). By crossing data on gender, age group and location it can be seen in Table
A5.1 that among children, the share of males is higher than females in urban areas and slightly
lower in the rural setting. Among youth, the proportion of males is higher than females in both
locations. However, for adults, proportions are reversed in the urban areas and are slightly lower
for women than for men in the rural areas. The elderly prevail among women who live both in
urban and rural locations. This is because death rates among men (7.2 per thousand inhabitants)
are higher than for women (5.2), according to the 2010 Census data. The higher ratio of women
to men in the urban population stems from higher mortality rates among men, particularly among
the youth as a result of urban violence. This is particularly true in the MAR, where intended and
violent lethal crimes (46.3 per 100,000 inhabitants) were higher than the State average in 2010
(39.8).45 This was the highest rate among all twelve development regions of the State.

5.       While gender inequalities are narrowing, they continue to impede the full
development potential of the province. Looking at the whole population, whereas in Brazil
women continue to be poorer than men in 2009, in the northeast Brazil and in Pernambuco, this
trend has reversed and, in 2009, women were marginally less poor than their male counterparts
both in the northeast and in Pernambuco (Figure A5.2). A similar pattern is observed in terms of
illiteracy. In 2009, females had lower levels of illiteracy than males, with 20.5 percent and 22.7
percent, respectively. These rates are better than the average for northeast Brazil, but still
significantly below the national average (see Table A5.2).

6.      Gender disparities are particularly enduring in terms of poverty reduction. The
Poverty Headcount (P0) measures the share of people who live below a poverty line—4USD per
day in this case. However, in order to assess whether the situation of the poor has improved, we
use the square poverty gap (P2) measure. The P2 poverty measure shows that poverty fell by
almost 4 percentage points, from 18.3 in 2006 to 14.3 in 2009. Moreover, the P2 poverty
measure for both males and females has also improved significantly for the same period.
Females, however, continue to perform worse than their male counterparts for both 2006 and
2009. Furthermore, the square poverty gap analysis reveals that, in Pernambuco, both male and
female Pernambucanos fare slightly worse than their counterparts in the states of the northeast
Brazil and significantly worse than males and females than for Brazil as a whole (Table A5.3).

7.      Race is a strong determinant of poverty in Brazil, with both black and mulatto male
and female-headed households poorer than their white counterparts. Indeed, there are large
differences in the levels of wellbeing among males and females of different racial backgrounds
(PNAD, 2009). The poverty headcount ratio (P0) shows that 41.1 percent of households headed
by black or mulatto females are poor, compared to 29.4 percent of households headed by white
females. A similar trend is observed for black and mulatto heads of household (43.1 percent are
poor) compared to their white counterparts (31.5 percent). These differences persist over time:
comparing 2006 to 2009, both male and females—whites, blacks, and mulattoes— experienced a
decline in their levels of poverty of 10 percentage points on average; but the differences among
them remained constant during this period. While the progress in reducing poverty for both
males and females in Pernambuco is commendable, the black and mulatto population remain
overrepresented in lower income quintiles (Figure A5.3)

8.      Location is another key determinant of poverty in Pernambuco: both males and
females living in rural areas are significantly poorer than their counterparts living in urban areas,
with differences between male and female more pronounced in rural settings. The P0 measure
shows that poverty is deeper in rural areas. Rural poverty in Brazil has historically concentrated
in the states of the northeast (IFAD, 2007). The rural poor are primarily small farmers and often
are faced with the harsh conditions of semi-arid zones, which make income-generating activities


                                                           112
very difficult. As a result, subsistence production predominates over other activities. According
to the most recent data available, both males and females living in rural areas of Pernambuco are
on average 20 percentage points poorer (see Table A5.4).

9.      Educational attainment is also strongly correlated with poverty and has
differentiated gender implications in Pernambuco. Education is a key asset for poverty
reduction and Pernambuco has made important progress towards increasing educational
attainment. Increased educational attainment can improve the livelihoods of the poor and reduce
the likelihood of becoming poor. Moreover, higher levels of education are associated with lower
levels of fertility, which, in turn, are correlated with a lower likelihood of falling into poverty
(Verner, 2004). In Pernambuco, females seem to do better as their level of education attainment
increases. Indeed, data reveal that girls consistently perform better in school than boys do. They
have, on average, more education than their male peers, with 6 and 5.5 years of education,
respectively.46

10.     Young female heads of household are more likely to be poor and unemployed—a
worrisome Catch-22 situation, given that, in 2006, 80.7 percent of female household heads were
under 25 years of age in Pernambuco. There are high risks of trans-generational transmission of
inequalities of opportunities. Seventy-three percent of households headed by a female younger
under 25 years of age are poor in Pernambuco, compared to 55 percent of households headed by
a young man. By contrast, households headed by females over 25 years of age are less likely to
be poor (33 percent) than households headed by their male counterparts (37 percent). According
to the PNAD, in 2009, a quarter of the females in the labor market in Pernambuco were working
as domestic workers, followed by commerce, and education. Men were mostly employed in
commerce, construction, and agriculture and farming sectors (Table A5.5).



46
    In Pernambuco, the P0 is 44.3 percent for household heads that are illiterate, compared to 36.4 percent for
those headed by a person who is not illiterate. When looking at gender differences, the data reveal interesting
results. Households who are headed by illiterate males are poorer than those headed by illiterate females with
61.5 percent and 56.7 percent, respectively. By contrast, households headed by females who are literate are
slightly poorer compared to males, with 43 percent and 41.2 percent, respectively. Differences in the P0 for heads
of households with no education and heads of households with primary education appear much larger for males
than for females. Data reveal that for 2009 38 percent of male household heads with primary education are poor
compared with 47 percent of their male counterparts who have no education. By contrast, 4 2 p e r c e n t o f

w i t h n o e d u c a t i o n . Household heads that h a v e c o m p l e t e d s e c o n d a r y education are far better off: in
2009, only 21.8 percent of male household heads with secondary education were poor, compared to 29 percent of
females with the same level of education. Finally, both male and female household heads with 12 or more years of
education are far less likely to be poor: only 6 percent of these female household heads are poor compared to 6.7
percent of males.

11.     The employment situation for female-headed household has worsened in
Pernambuco. While the situation for female-headed household may not be reflective of the
entire gender dynamics at play in labor markets, it has strong implications for equity and poverty
reduction, as such households tend to face higher degree of vulnerability to shocks and
variations. In 2009, 8.9 percent of female heads of households were unemployed compared to 4.1
percent of male heads of households. The data reveal that the unemployment rate for females has
worsened since 2006, when it was 6.3 percent. Females in Pernambuco not only suffer from
higher levels of unemployment but those who are employed also receive lower income compared
to men. In 2009, women received 82 percent of the income earned by men. Even more striking is
the fact that women with 12 or more years of education earned income that was only 54 percent
of their male counterparts.47 The challenge for Pernambuco is to expand the access to the labor
market to women, especially to non-traditional sectors that present high earnings potential (such
as construction), while reducing the existing income gap between males and females.

12.      In Pernambuco, the existing gender wage gap between females and males
represented the equivalent of a -10 percent hourly wage differential in 2009. The summary
statistics of the independent covariates presented in Table A5.6 reveal that in 2009 the mean log
hourly wages were 1.21 for females and 1.32 for males. Females tend to work significantly less
hours than males. Males worked almost 42 hours/week compared to 37.1 hours/week for
females—a difference of 5.1 hours/week. Females, however, reported half a year more in
education than males.

13.     The gender wage gap reflects many characteristics of the socioeconomic situation of
males and females in Pernambuco, varying greatly across racial groups, occupations, and
industries, and location. Table A5.7 reports the estimates from the general human capital model
for urban areas in Pernambuco. Levels of education and job characteristics are shown to be
important factors for wage determination in Pernambuco. However, gender appears to be the
single most significant factor for wage determination. The positive and statistically significant
coefficient (male=1) shows that men receive significantly higher wages than females after
controlling for other factors. The large coefficient implies that males earn, on average, 38 percent
more per hourly wage than females in urban areas in Pernambuco. Other covariates, such as race,
also appear to be important in determining wages. Findings reveal that blacks or mulattoes in
Pernambuco make 22 percent less than their counterparts.

14.     Analysis on the 2009 PNAD shows the largest gender-gap to be coming from
education, as the returns appear to be larger for men than for women. Table A5.8 reports
the estimated wage function by males and females in urban areas in Pernambuco in 2009. The
same wage regression (dividing the data by sex in order to analyze the gender wage gaps in the
labor market) shows returns to education to be larger for men than for women—both for
secondary (β = .453) and (β = .261), and tertiary education (β = 1.362) and (β = .996),
respectively—despite the fact that females have, on average, higher levels of education than
men. The return to the sector of employment varies widely according to sector. Not surprisingly,
having children younger than 18 years old at home implies a decreasing rate of return for both
males and females.

15.     Decomposing the gender wage gap using the Oaxaca-Blinder methodology shows
that the human and job characteristic factors explain more than 40 percent of the entire
gender gap in urban Pernambuco. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methodology is used to
flesh out the contribution of endowments and coefficients to wage determination for males and
females in Pernambuco. The analysis shows that when that male-weighted value is applied as the
reference group, the human and job characteristic factors explain more than 40 percent of the
entire gender gap in urban Pernambuco (A5.9).48

16.     Although, females continue to lag behind males in virtually every area, the
Government of Pernambuco has been committed to building a more gender equitable
society, notably through the SecMulher. The proposed DPL aims at supporting the
Government of Pernambuco in that effort. The decision of the Pernambuco Government to make
the Special Secretariat of Women’s Affairs a permanent secretariat and, concurrently, to add
resources and reorganize its organizational structure adds stature and influence to the institution.
Until these changes were made, the special Secretariat had limited authority to act. This authority
extended to two areas: (i) advocating for greater emphasis being placed on issues related to
women in the public policy arena; and (ii) providing training for females in rural areas, through
the Chapeu de Palha program.

                            Box A5.15: The Chapéu de Palha Program
The Chapéu de Palha Program was created in 2007 with the objective of reaching families in the Zona
Canavieira (sugarcane producing region) who are unemployed in between harvests and strengthen rural
populations’—and particularly females’—productive, social and political capacities.
Vocational training for females is a special focus of the program and activities are implemented in
partnership with SENAI (Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial) and SENAC (Serviço Nacional
de Aprendizagem Comercial). SecMulher has organized a course to train females in non-traditional
sectors (i.e. mechanics, construction, electricity) with the objective of changing the prevailing gender-
specific obstacles to accessing the labor market in non-traditional sectors.
A condition for participation in these courses is the completion of a rights literacy course that addresses
basic concepts of citizenship, human rights, and gender equality. The trainings started in 2007 in the Zona
Canavieira (sugarcane producing region) and were expanded to the São Francisco Valley in 2009 and to
the Agreste in 2010. Another expansion of the project is planned for 2011 to reach women in the coastal
areas of Pernambuco. By becoming a full secretariat, there will be a substantial increase in the number of
women trained annually: 4300 females will have received vocational training in 2011, whereas in 2010
1,215 women received training. Moreover, there is an interest from SecMulher to absorb the full
execution of this program as of 2012.



17.     SecMulher now has authority to expand the activities of the secretariat to other key
gender issues such as violence against females, increasing resources for education, and
expanding health services. These are necessary actions if the goal of economic empowerment
of women is to be achieved. In addition, SecMulher’s influence within the government has
grown, enabling it to facilitate gender mainstreaming gender and establish gender-coordinating
units in other sectors.

18.     Two noteworthy agreements are under preparation with the Secretariats of
Education (SecEdu) and Health (SecSaude), with a signature expected to take place in early
2012. The first is a partnership with the SecEdu to create gender units in all full-time schools,
where gender sensitization activities are implemented with students and teachers. Five pilot units
are already in place and there are plans to expand this to other full-time schools as well as 14
vocational training schools, reaching a total of 116 municipalities and more than 70,000 students
by the end of SecMulher’s current term. The second agreement is a partnership with the
SecSaude to define and implement strategic actions providing comprehensive assistance and



                                                   119
services to females in areas such as preventing violence, screenings for cervical, breast, and skin
cancer, and providing training on gender issues to municipal health secretaries and coordinators.

19.     SecMulher is also developing an Action Plan for Women Living in Metropolitan
Areas (Plano de Mulheres Metropolitanas) to establish government policies, priorities, and
programs targeting women. This innovative and participatory program will use both the
Internet and social networks to gather and disseminate information to women in urban areas.
SecMulher has also focused its attention on reducing and preventing violence against women,
and on providing services to them. At present, Pernambuco has 5 shelters to assist women who
are victims of violence. New ―model‖ shelters are being planned to expand services to victims.
Additional plans have been developed to build 19 regional women’s police stations by 2015.
This is approach will enable women residing in remote areas to have access to police services.49
There are already programs in place to offer training workshops on gender sensitization for
police officers and law enforcement and social service providers in the criminal justice sector.
The present plan calls for training 1,000 people per workshop and a total of 6 workshops until
2014.

20.    The decision to create a permanent secretariat has, naturally, raised expectations
that change will occur and that there will be increased capacity to respond to growing
needs regarding gender equity. Analyzing the information obtained at the upcoming
Conferencias Estaduais e Municipais das Mulheres will help the SecMulher gauge the
magnitude of needs from women in Pernambuco. Addressing these needs remains one of
SecMulher’s most important priorities for this term of office.

21.     The SecMulher is aware of the fact that becoming a permanent secretariat implies
increasing the capacity to respond to the growing number of demands related to gender
issues. The information gathered during the upcoming Conferencias Estaduais e Municipais das
Mulheres will help SecMulher gauge the number and quality of demands from women in the
State. However, SecMulher is already planning ahead to be able to respond to these demands as
follows:

             i) Establish 12 coordinating agencies throughout the State. The objective is to
                bring SecMulher’s policies and programs to all territories and municipalities of
                Pernambuco through a layered approach that emphasizes state presence at three
                levels, including regions and municipalities, so that citizens can have full access
                to the services offered by the secretariat.

             ii) Support the establishment of entities at the municipal level to articulate
                 actions and programs with a gender perspective and train staff from
                 municipal secretariats on gender issues. This program started in 2007 and there
                 are currently 111 entities state-wide. Efforts accelerated in 2011, with the




49
   The fact that SecMulher is working closely with the police to open more women’s police stations is significant
since women’s police stations have been closed in another state—Sao Paulo closed several women’s police stations
in the interior of the state as part of the restructuring of the police force.


                                                      120
                    objective of opening of 30 entities a year, so as to reach all 185 municipalities in
                    Pernambuco by 2015.50

                iii) In addition to the 12 coordinating agencies, SecMulher is currently
                     discussing the feasibility of establishing two Centros de Aceleracao do
                     Desenvolvimento da Mulher. The main objective of these multi-sectoral centers
                     is to accelerate the socioeconomic development of females in Pernambuco. To
                     achieve these objectives, the centers will bring together different government
                     secretariats and civil society organizations.

22.    To be able to implement those new initiatives, SecMulher has expressed interest in
seeking assistance from the Bank to initiate new programs and strengthen their capacity to
respond effectively to new demands.




50
     During election year the objective is to open 20 only.


                                                              121

           IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Brazil

                                Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/108
                                              August 3, 2011

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

On July 20, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with
Brazil.51

                                                    Background

1. Brazil has made remarkable strides over the last decade, emerging as a leading actor on the
global economic stage. A strong policy framework and sustained political commitment to reduce
inflation and public debt levels has increased the resilience of the economy to external shocks.
Moreover, the increased macroeconomic stability, combined with well-targeted social policies,
has allowed the country to take advantage of favorable external conditions over the past decade
to accelerate growth and reduce poverty and inequality to historic lows.
2. The economy has recovered strongly from the crisis growing last year by 7.5 percent, with the
unemployment rate falling to historic lows of 6.4 percent in May this year, and output estimated
to now be above potential. Activity has been moderating since the middle of last year, but
buoyant domestic demand has contributed to some widening of the current account deficit to 2.3
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2010, notwithstanding the very favorable prices for
Brazil’s key commodity exports. Moreover, strong demand and tightening labor market
conditions, combined with commodity price shocks, have led to rising inflation. Indeed, inflation
reached the top of the 2.5–6.5 percent inflation target band in May.
3. Credit has been growing fast for several years now, reflecting in part a process of financial
deepening, with the credit-to-GDP ratio rising from 24 percent of GDP in 2004 to 46 percent of
GDP in 2010. Bank credit to the private sector continues to grow rapidly, rising by 20 percent in
April 2011. Lending by private banks, which fell sharply during the crisis, has rebounded very
51
   Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.




                                                          122
strongly. Meanwhile, public bank lending, which was ramped up during the crisis to offset the
fall-off in private lending, also continues to expand at a rapid pace. Responding to concerns
about excessive risk-taking in some market segments, the authorities late last year introduced
various macro-prudential measures aimed at moderating credit growth.
4. Brazil remains a favored destination for international investors, reflecting in part its favorable
economic prospects and high yields. Net capital inflows have been accelerating and reached
US$52.6 billion through end-April, almost twice as high as over the same period in 2010.
Foreign direct investment flows have increased sharply in recent months, reflecting mainly
investments in large projects, while external borrowing by banks and corporations rose fast
earlier in the year. To manage inflows, the authorities have used all parts of their policy tool kit.
With the exchange rate appreciating to high levels, intervention has continued with purchases of
about US$37 billion in the spot market in the first half of 2011. As such, Brazil’s reserves have
reached US$335 billion at end-June, the sixth largest holding in the world. The authorities have
also been introducing various capital flow management measures that have gradually gained
some traction in moderating incentives for capital flows.
5. The authorities have been gradually withdrawing policy stimulus. The monetary policy target
rate was raised by 200 basis points during April-July 2010. After a mid-cycle pause of several
months, the policy rate has been increased again by 150 basis points since the beginning of the
year, to reach 12.25 at end-June. Fiscal policy ended up providing a substantial procyclical
stimulus in 2010 as the economy was already recovering. However, the authorities earlier this
year announced a package of spending reductions (relative to the initial budget) equivalent to 1.2
percent of GDP and a primary surplus target of about 3 percent of GDP for 2011. Combined with
plans for reducing Treasury transfers to the development bank BNDES, this should contribute to
a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in the current year.
                                  Executive Board Assessment
6. Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management
and strong policy framework, which increased Brazil’s resilience to external shocks, spurred
economic growth, and promoted greater social equity. Directors agreed, however, that although
the outlook remains broadly favorable, there are signs of overheating. Accordingly, they stressed
the importance of further calibrating the policy mix to address near-term macroeconomic
pressures.
7. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to phase out the fiscal stimulus introduced during
the crisis. They considered that additional fiscal tightening would support disinflation and the
management of capital inflows, while reducing the need for raising further Brazil’s already high
interest rates. Directors supported the authorities’ decision to reduce the exceptional funding
provided to the National Development Bank, in view of the rapid credit expansion.
8. Directors supported the tightening of monetary conditions by the central bank to contain
inflation risks. They agreed that, while the pick-up of inflation reflects in part commodity price
shocks, strong demand and labor market pressures have also been key factors. Directors
welcomed the central bank’s commitment to tighten monetary policy as needed to meet the
midpoint of the inflation target band by end-2012.



                                                123
9. Directors agreed that overall financial soundness indicators are favorable. They stressed,
however, the need for heightened vigilance against financial risks, given the pace of credit
growth and continued reliance on external borrowing. Directors observed that macro-prudential
policies have played a helpful role in slowing credit in some segments, but a few Directors noted
that such policies may need to be applied more broadly to gain traction. Directors commended
the authorities for steps taken to ensure a smooth transition to new international standards under
Basel III. They also welcomed the authorities’ decision to undertake a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) update next year.
10. Directors took note of the authorities’ pragmatic use of the policy toolkit for managing
capital inflows. Macroeconomic policies have been appropriately tightened, the exchange rate
has appreciated substantially, and official foreign exchange reserves have increased. Directors
considered that the authorities’ use of capital flow management measures has been appropriate.
However, a number of Directors cautioned that these measures are prone to circumvention, while
many Directors noted that attendant costs should also be taken into account and pointed to their
distortionary effects. Many Directors recommended that further macroeconomic policy
adjustment be part of the response to large capital inflows.
11. Directors underscored the need to tackle longstanding structural rigidities. They encouraged
the authorities to implement key fiscal reforms, including increasing budget flexibility,
reforming the state VAT system, and implementing the social security reform. Directors noted
that measures to improve the business climate and enhance competitiveness would lower
structurally high interest rates and boost long-term growth prospects.
