                         RSSP2 has successfully completed early by 8 months implementation of its project activities. The Project has 4% remaining to disburse on contracts completed that are in the testing
                         phase. Overall, RSSP II has achieved all of the targets and outcome indicators as well as exceeding by a good margin two of the PDO indicators established for the Project:

                         1  Rice production increased by 100%. Baseline 5, 597t. Achieved 11,206 (102% of goal).
                         2  Intensification technologies adopted by 50% of farmers. Achieved 98% (almost 200% of goal).

                         1  Increased rehabilitated marshlands area. Baseline 3,110 Ha. Target 3,300 Ha. Achieved 3,324 Ha (101% of goal).
                         2  Increased rehabilitated hillside area. Baseline 14,485 ha. Target 9,900 Ha. Achieved 10,096 Ha (102% of goal).
                         3  100% increase in crop yields. Rice baseline 3 t/ha, achieved 6.4t/ha (113% of goal). Potato baseline 8.6 t/ha, achieved 19.65 t/ha (128% of goal). Maize baseline 0.8 t/ha,
                         achieved 4.05 t/ha (406% of goal).

                         In summary, production goals have been exceeded, capacity building efforts for cooperatives have produced the revenue increases intended as well as tripling the target number of
                         beneficiary cooperatives that increased incomes. Overall implementation progress (OIP) of RSSP2 is rated as Satisfactory.

                         The next mission will be the Implementation Completion Report mission which will be scheduled in the next few months.
