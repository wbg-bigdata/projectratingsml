                  SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM:
             SIXTHPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


                         Credit and ProgramSummary



Borrower:       The Socialist Republic o f Vietnam.

Amount:         SDRll4.8 million (US$175.0 million equivalent).

Terms:          Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.

Description:    A sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 6), as the first operation
                in   a   cycle   aimed    at   implementing Vietnam's        Socio-Economic
                Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-20 10, approved inJune 2006.

Benefits:       The present operation provides further support to Vietnam's reform
                program. The current cycle o f PRSCs is a vehicle for the World Bank, and
                the donor community more broadly, to stay engaged with a client that has
                delivered an outstanding performance in terms o f economic growth and
                poverty reduction. It also recognizes the commitment o f the government to
                pursue and deepen its reform strategy, as reflected over the last few months
                in major milestones, includingthe entry into the World Trade Organization
                (WTO), the approval o f an ambitious banking reform roadmap and the
                adoption o f a determined stance in the fight against corruption.

                Active engagement should strengthen the coherence o f the program,
                especially because tlie effectiveness of sectoral policy actions hinges on the
                success o f more fundamental governance reforms in areas such public
                financial management, public administration reform and legal andjudiciary
                development.      Engagement should also help improve tlie content of
                specific policy actions, to ensure the timeliness o f their adoption, and to
                monitor the impact o f the overall program on broader development
                outcomes.

                This engagement is all the more important given that this could be the last
                cycle o f general budget support operations on concessional terms, hence
                providing an exceptional window for high-level policy access in a country
                that is not aid dependent.

Risks:          At the same time, its own success confronts Vietnam with new challenges.
                The reform agenda has not progressed at the same pace across all fronts,
                and private sector response has been much stronger in some areas than in
                others. As a result, the country is facing potentially dangerous imbalances.
                The biggest risks faced by Vietnam are related to tlie sustainability o f its
                remarkable performance, economically, socially and institutionally.




                                           ...
                                           111

                  I n the short term, the biggest vulnerability stems from possible turbulence
                  in the financial sector, which could in turn undermine Vietnam's gains in
                  the fight against poverty. The development of capital markets has vastly
                  outpaced that of the supervisory and regulatory capacity o f monetary
                  authorities.   This calls for a rapid upgrading o f policies related to the
                  banking sector, the securities market and the management of public debt,
                  all o f which are part of the proposed reform program.

                  Success in global integration, resulting in massive inflows o f Foreign
                  Direct Investment (FDI) to the growth poles o f the country and increased
                  competition in formally protected sectors, may also test the ability of
                  Vietnam to preserve social inclusion. There is a risk that some groups
                  could lose in the short term, and a clear prospect o f a widening urban-rural
                  gap in the medium term.           Rapid feedback channels from affected
                  stakeholders, inclusive policies in the social sectors, and transparent
                  mechanisms to transfer resources to the poorer regions are among the
                  mitigating measures supported by the proposed series of operations.

                  Other imbalances are related to rapid urbanization and infrastructure
                  development, in a context where transparency in land zoning conversion
                  and compensation are still partial. Cases o f corruption and social strife are
                  increasingly related to land. Tackling this risk requires rapid progress in
                  transparency at various levels, from regional planning to infrastructure
                  networks to land use to appropriate taxation to the monitoring of assets o f
                  the relevant civiI servants. These are also areas receiving special attention
                  in the proposed series o f operations.

Co-financing:     Numerous bilateral and multilateral donors have expressed their support to
                  the PRSC process in Vietnam. Nineteen of them have participated in the

                                      I. INTRODUCTION



1.       Vietnam has been on a sustained path of economic reform since the launching of its
Doi Moi (renovation) process, in 1986. Tlie overall principle has been tlie increased reliance on
market mechanisms, while maintaining a socialist orientation. The latter can be interpreted as
focusing on social inclusion while preserving a leading role for tlie state. Beyond this general
principle, the process lias involved a systematic piloting o f reforms, followed by some form o f
evaluation, an effort to forge consensus among relevant stakeholders, and finally the scaling up o f
reportedly successful initiatives. The drive towards reform started before the collapse o f the
Soviet Union. In its aftermath, it also involved important departures from the dominant approach
to economic transition. Until recently, reform moves were especially cautious (if not outright
slow) in relation to the privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and tlie restructuring o f
the banking sector. Gradualism might have prevented a collapse o f economic activity and of
government revenue in the early stages of transition, and probably resulted in a more limited
concentration o f wealth. It might have also resulted in a milder impact o f tlie East Asian crisis.
On tlie other hand, gradualism in the reform of the state sector raises concerns regarding the
potential buildupo f government liabilities.

2.       Comprehensive economic reforms have led to rapid economic growth and
remarkable progress on development outcomes. Vietnam has been among tlie fastest-growing
economies in the world for almost two decades. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
Iias increased at roughly 6.9 percent per year in real terms. Given tlie very low level o f domestic
prices at the inception o f tlie reform process, and the subsequent appreciation as the economy
develops, the average growth rate o f per capita GDP measured in dollar terms has been well into
two-digit figures. What is more remarkable, amidst such rapid economic transformation, has
been the relative stability of inequality indicators. Tlie Gini index increased from 0.34 in 1993,
tlie year o f the first representative household expenditure survey, to 0.37 in 2004. This stability
probably reflects tlie priority given to rural development in the initial phases of economic
transition, especially through a relatively egalitarian redistribution o f collective agricultural land
to individual households and the liberalization o f trade in agricultural products. The modest
increase in inequality lias resulted in a dramatic reduction in poverty. Based on a consumption
basket o f food and non-food items sustaining an intake o f 2,100 calories per person per day, the
poverty headcount declined from 58 percent in 1993 to less than 20 percent in 2004. Other social
indicators, including child mortality, have shown equally remarkable improvements.

3 .      There was a considerable acceleration of reforms around 2001, justifying the first
series of PRSCs, and then again in 2006. The former involved the passing o f an enterprise law
that greatly facilitated business registration and operation, the signing of a bilateral trade
agreement with tlie United States that strengthened global integration and resulted in important
legal improvements, the adoption o f the first serious steps towards SOE divestiture and the


                                                  1

strengthening o f public financial management. The latter was crowned by the accession to the
WTO, the adoption o f an ambitious banking reform roadmap, a new resolve to equitize large
SOEs and transfer the exercise o f state ownership rights out o f line ministries and provincial
governments, the drive towards introducing universal programs for social protection, and the
adoption o f a determined anti-corruption drive. There is little dissent regarding the direction for
economic reforms, and internal debates are increasingly focusing on strengthening the
mechanisms for citizen's feedback aiid government accountability.

4.      Emerging from massive poverty less than two decades ago, the vision now is to
attain middle-incomestatus by 2010. Ifcurrent growth trends were to continue, GDP per capita
could cross the US$lOOO benchmark in three years time.                This would be an impressive
accomplishment for a country whose economy was still dilapidated by decades o f war, with
incentives distorted by central planning, in the early 1990s. However, attaining middle-income
status is seen as more than a quantitative goal. Referring to such status, rather than to any
specific growth rate or threshold for GDP per capita, is a way to emphasize the need for a
different, more sophisticated set o f economic institutions. Vietnam has by now a much more
diversified economy, involving an increasing number o f stakeholders, aiid requiring finer steering
mechanisms. Reaching middle-income status requires further financial deepening to support
capital mobilization, the regulation o f access to and pricing o f infrastructure services, the gradual
development o f modern social insurance, more effective tools for environmental protection, legal
atidjudiciary reforms, atid the effective containment o f corruption, among others.

5.      The new SEDP 2006-2010 articulates this vision, reflecting the transition towards
strategic planning for a market economy. The SEDP, approved in June 2006, illustrates the
depth o f Vietnam's transition. Unlike previous five-year plans, which focused on quantitative
targets as if the state was still in charge o f producing most goods and services, the SEDP
emphasizes development outcomes, and the policy reforms needed to attain them.              It relies on
data analysis, rather than administrative reporting, to substantiate its diagnostics and
recommendations. It has also led to the adoption o f a framework to monitor progress towards
attaining development outcomes. The process through which the SEDP was prepared was more
encompassing than in the past. Extensive consultations were held, going beyond the boundaries
o f government, aiid involving businesses, grassroots communities, overseas Vietnamese and
donors. This was the first time a five-year plan was declassified and discussed by the National
Assembly before beingconsidered by the Party.

6.      The donor community has decided to align its efforts behind the SEDP, while
acknowledging that other key documents will shape reforms in the coming years. Such
alignment is a testimony to the strong ownership o f the reform program by the government o f
Vietnam. It also reflects satisfaction with the process through which the SEDP was prepared.
Above all, the SEDP is seen as both a credible and a sustainable strategy to foster economic
growth and poverty reduction. It is credible because o f the ambitious policy reforms it proposes.
Those reforms are organized around three pillars: supporting business development, keeping
growth inclusive and better managing natural resources; a fourth, underlying pillar concerns the
need to modernize institutions so as to deliver on the other three fronts. The SEDP is also seen as
sustainable because it should lead to manageable levels o f public debt by 2010, in spite o f a
massive effort to develop large-scale infrastructure. Inthe case o f the World Bank, the Joint Staff
Advisory Note (JSAN) submitted to the Board in December 2006, atid the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) submitted in January 2007 concluded that the SEDP had incorporated the
necessary Poverty Reduction Strategy principles, was broadly sound and was a plan that could
both deliver growth and reduce poverty.




                                                  2

7.       At the same time, donors recognize that some of the reforms needed will be
challenging, requiring attention to their content and timeliness. The SEDP represents a
sustainable development strategy only provided that macroeconomic management remains
prudent aiid state sector reform is not unnecessarily delayed. The international commitments
made by Vietnam in its drive to accede to tlie WTO can help, by imposing clear deadlines for the
adoption o f specific measures. But implementing WTO commitments from a "development
approach", as opposed to a inere "compliance approach", will require strong cross-sectoral
coordination. Moreover, the list o f policy reforms considered by tlie SEDP is remarkably broad,
which makes prioritization and sequencing a priority. There is conselisus that supporting the
reform agenda o f Vietnam does not entail favoring one o fthe SEDP pillars over the others. But it
requires being selective within each o f the pillars, and paying attention to the content o f the most
important measures.

8.       The proposed credit is the first in a five-year cycle aimed at supporting the
implementation of the SEDP. PRSCs are well-suited to address the challetiges mentioned
above. The cross-cutting nature o f the policy dialogue they support strengthens coordination
among line ministries and government agencies. Their emphasis on a selected number o f policy
actions facilitates an in-depth discussion o f their content. Their otherwise demanding annual
sequence, combined with the forward-looking nature o f tlie triggers used to launch the
preparation o f the next operation in tlie cycle, helps keeping the pace o f reform. Meanwhile, the
progress made on public financial management over the last decade mitigates the risks associated
with direct budget support. However, unlike other developing countries with aii ongoing PRSC
process, Vietnam is not dependent on tlie resources contributed by donors to finance government
spending. Overall, and in spite o f their large number o f co-financiers, PRSC operations in
Vietnam amount to less than 2 percent o f public expenditures and about a third o f the additional
cost o f economic reforms. The fact that PRSC resources are not essential for tlie operation o f the
Vietnamese government raises tlie bar for tlie policy dialogue, giving especial relevance to its
analytical underpinnings.

9.   Engagement at this stage is seen as essential to lay the foundations of a modern and
inclusive market economy, supporting sustained growth in the longer term. If Vietnam
succeeds in attaining middle-income status before 2010, the cycle o f PRSCs associated with the
SEDP will be the last one to be supported by IDA. The concessional component o f donor co-
financing may also decline over time. Therefore, the five-year period ahead represents a critically
important window for engagement by the international community. Such engagement is all the
more relevant because Vietnam's ability to sustain its remarkable growth trajectory over several
more decades, and eventually become an industrial country, may be determined during this
period. The reforms associated with attaining middle-income status are more complex than those
needed to move away from central planning. Active engagement should contribute to improving
the content aiid coherence o f such reforms.



                          11.     THE FIVE-YEARPLAN2006-2010



I O .    The SEDP 2006-2010 is a milestone in the modernization of planning in Vietnam,
justifying the alignment of donor support to its implementation. Approved in June, 2006, it
outlines tlie policy measures needed for Vietnam to advance to middle-income status by the end
o f the decade. Following an established practice, the SEDP sets the framework for government
action and resource allocation.      But this framework is much more focused on attaining


                                                   3

development outcomes than in the past. Untilrecently, five-year plans entertained the fiction that
government was still in direct control o f delivering goods and services, which resulted in the
compilation o f large numbers o f production targets. Consultation processes involved government
agencies only, whereas self-reporting and administrative data substituted for a genuine
assessment o f results. By contrast, the framework for the SEDP was influenced by consultations
outside government, from grassroots communities to the overseas Vietnamese. And for the first
time the government's primary planning document will also be used as a basis for guiding and
allocatingOfficial Development Assistance (ODA).

 11.     The preparation SEDP 2006-2010 built on the experience with the Comprehensive
Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). Since the late 1990s, several initiatives
had been undertaken to support the modernization o f planning processes.             I n June 2001,
recognizing the limitation o f both traditional five-year plans and targeted poverty reduction
programs, the Minister o f Planningand Investment (MPI) was given the responsibility to produce
a broader document, addressing poverty issues in a comprehensive way.              In preparing this
document, consultation and debate beyond were extended beyond governtnent boundaries,
reaching out to poor communities. The new document represented an important step in terms o f
content as well. Rather than relying on administrative records, the analysis combined high-
quality quantitative and qualitative data into the discussion. This led to a better coverage o f
sensitive issues, including the challenge o f combating ethnic minority poverty and the problems
faced by urban migrants in accessing basic services. In parallel, there was a shift away from the
description o f inputs and the setting o f targets towards the statement o f development objectives.
As part o f this process, the Milletinium Development Goals (MDGs) were localized into a clearly
defined set o f Vietnam Development Goals (VDGs). There were also efforts to connect policy
actions and resource allocation, with a rudimentary "costing" exercise for the VDGs.

 12.     CPRGS providedthe foundation for the first series of PRSC operationsin Vietnam,
while also playing an important demonstrationeffect. The new document was approved it1
May 2002, covering a three-year period. Subsequently, government officials, donors and NGOs
discussed the sequence o f policy actions needed to attain the CPRGS objectives. This exercise,
jointly with subsequent analytical work by the World Bank and ADB towards the Vietnam
Development Report 2003, laid the foundations for a series o f direct budget support operations.
Since June 2003 an increasingly large number o f donors channel resources to the government
through annual PRSC operations, it1 recognition o f the progress made in the implementation o f
the CPRGS agenda. The allocation o f those resources i s decided by government and their
spending i s processed through Vietnamese procedures. But the triggers to proceed with the
following operatioii inthe cycle were related to the adoption o f the key policy measures to deliver
on the CPRGS objectives. By strengthening the coherence o f reforms across sectors, improving
their content and timeliness, and mobilizing donor resources in their support, this process showed
that strategic planning for development made sense in a market economy, but was quite different
a process from the one leading to traditional five-year plans.

13.      This approach was workable thanks to the considerable progress made in public
financial managementover the years. Important steps in the process included the introduction
o f a single treasury account, the adoption o f international public accounting standards, and the
establishment o f the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) as an agency under the National Assembly.
An obvious follow-up to the "costing" o f CPRGS was the preparation o f Medium-Term
Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). The first pilot MTEF reports, covering education, health,
transport, and agriculture and rural development, were submitted to the Ministry o f Finance
(MOF) at the end o f the previous five-year cycle.        Four provincial MTEFs are also under
preparation. These pilots have now been extended and have been complemented by regulations
that set annual budgets within a multi-year framework. While the submission and approval o f the


                                                   4

budget by the National Assembly continues to be done on an annual basis, they have to be based
on a multi-year framework.        Initially covering three years, this framework has by now been
extended to the entire planning cycle. A further link between planning and budgeting processes
resulted from the introduction o f norms for allocating resources to provinces. Those norms
concerned recurrent budget expenditures first, and capital expenditures more recently. They
became fully operational in 2007.          Mainly based on population figures, these norms also
incorporate poverty measures into their formulas and should lead to additional resources for
poorer parts o f the country.

14.      However, CPRGS also needed to be adjusted over time, especially in relation to its
treatment of large-scale infrastructure.          Planning documents for a command economy
emphasized massive investment projects, whereas CPRGS focused on expenditures related to
human development and social protection. At a deeper level, there were also diverging views in
relation to the main drivers of poverty reduction, with the East Asian experience attaching more
importance to large-scale infrastructure than the more microeconomic (or grassroots) poverty
analyses underlying CPRGS.         At times, this gap translated into a debate on whether ODA
resources should be channeled to investment projects or rather to the government budget.
Subsequent experience clearly showed the complementary o f these two vehicles for ODA.
Aware of the need to bridge the gap, the government proposed to "expand" the CPRGS so that it
wouId more appropriately address the role o f large-scale infrastructure in economic growth and
poverty reduction. This was done in December 2003.

15.      A more important shortcoming of CPRGS was its sitting outside the mainstream
decision-makingprocesses used by the governmentof Vietnam. The CPRGS was neither the
five-year plan nor a recognized sectoral strategy.       This unclear status subsequently generated
some confusion among officials, who found it difficult to judge what their obligations were in
relation to the document. Conveying the CPRGS approach and messages to authorities at local
levels was most difficult. With the progress made in decentralization in Vietnam, almost half o f
public expenditures are allocated by government officials in provinces, districts and communes.
But few local officials knew about CPRGS or considered that it had direct implications for their
daily work. To redress this shortcoming, an initiative to rollout the CPRGS approach to the
provinces was launched in April 2004.             Over time, two dozen provincial governments
experimented with the preparation o f strategic plans. Their efforts were supported by donors in a
decentralized fashion, each local government choosing its own approach to bring together the
various departments involved and come up with a renovated provincial plan. The experience was
rich in terms o f learning, but diverse if measured in terms o f success on the ground.

16.      These gaps and shortcomings highlighted the importance of working through the
normal planning processes of Vietnam.             Towards the end o f the five-year cycle that just
finished, the need to mainstream the CPRGS approach was obvious to government and donors
alike. I n September 2004 the Prime Minister issued a directive stating that the new five-year plan
would be drafted according to the same principles that had governed the preparation o f the
CPRGS. Guidelines subsequently issued by M P I to line ministries and provinces emphasized the
importance o f using a broad range o f data (including participatory poverty assessments, survey
data and research carried out by local institutes and international organizations) to underpin
planning objectives.      The guidelines required an open process, specifically involving the
publication o f draft plans. They also specified the need to identify indicators linked to the VDGs
and to include a resource dimension into the plan.

17.      The process leading to the preparation of the SEDP 2006-2010 had important
strengths compared to its predecessors. There was a serious effort to collect inputs from
different groups o f the Vietnamese society.          In addition to internal discussions within



                                                   5

government, consultation workshops were held with local officials, groups o f academics, the
domestic business sector, iiiteriiational and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), people
living with disabilities (PWD), overseas Vietnamese, women and women's groups, aiid donors.
A series o f participatory research exercises involving local experts and international NGOs also
helped to gather feedback from poor communities in 17 sites across the country. Tlie draft SEDP
was declassified for the first time ever, and it was discussed by the National Assembly in
November 2005, a departure from previous practice which scl~eduledNational Assembly
discussion after the Party Congress. This innovation gave members o f parliament more influence
over tlie content o f the document than in previous planning cycles. There was also a second
round o f consultations within government and with donors and NGOs following the first
discussion at tlie National Assembly.

18.       There is also considerable progress in relation to the use of data and the set up of a
credible monitoring and evaluation framework. Reliable data from representative l~ousel~old
surveys is used by the SEDP 2006-2010 to present a comprehensive analysis o f poverty in
Vietnam. Tlie text includes candid discussions about disadvantaged groups and regions and about
tlie challenges presented by the emergence o f a growing gap between socioeconomic groups.
Issues o f social inclusion are no longer restricted to the discussion o f targeted programs but are
instead tackled in the sectoral sections o f the plan. A results framework was recently completed
by MPI. This framework is structured logically around a results chain from inputs to outcomes.
It includes a substantial pillar that refers to measuring progress in the promotion o f good
governance, committing the government to measuring progress in improving transparency and
participation, strengthening decentralization, managing public resources better aiid reducing
corruption. The framework also recognizes that much o f the information on results will need to
be provided or verified tlirougli independent surveys.

19.       I n the SEDP, the government sets out intended actions that fall broadly into four
main areas: (a) the promotion o f growth and transition to a market economy; (b) reducing
poverty atid ensuring social inclusion; (c) managing the environment aiid natural resources in a
sustainable manner; and, (d) building institutions that can support the strategy. The first three
pillars are explicitly listed in tlie SEDP, whereas the fourth one is introduced in the monitoring
and evaluation framework as the foundation to make progress on the other three. Taken together,
intended actions under these four pillars can pave the way for Vietnam to become a middle-
income country by the end o f the period.

20.       The SEDP 2006-2010 is also fiscally sustainable, despite the high level of public
investment associated with the development of large-scale infrastructure. The baseline
scenario o f the most recent Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) by the World Bank and the
IMF is broadly in line with tlie investment and growth outlook o f the SEDP. It estimates public
and publicly-guaranteed debt to increase from nearly 44 percent o f the GDP in 2005 to around 51
percent by 2011, This increase, though significant, is still considered well within manageable
limits, especially since more than half o f it will remain on highly concessional terms.        Tlie
concessiotial component o f Vietnam's debt, embodied in long repayment periods and low interest
rates, is reflected in the gap between the nominal level of public debt and its net present value.
External debt, both public and private, is projected to decline somewhat: from a little over 32
percent o f GDP to just under 3 1 percent. The ratio o f external debt service payments to exports is
estimated to remain below 6 percent during 2005 to 2011. Vietnam should thus remain at low
risk o f external debt distress.

2 I. Reform programs are not cast in stone, however,and the SEDP 2006-2010 i s bound
to be complementedby other strategic documents and policy developments over time. The
importance o f planning should not be over-emphasized, especially in a market economy. Change


                                                   6

also happens outside documents produced every five years. For instance, some o f the most
important decisions over the last cycle, from the acceleration o f negotiations to accede to the
WTO to the adoption o f the banking reform roadmap to the approval o f the Anti-Corruption Law,
were not foreseen as such in the previous five-year plan or in the CPRGS. Also, the plan i s at
times a follower, more than a leader, to the extent that it records and scales up provincial
innovations. In approaching the proposed series o f operations, it is therefore important to keep in
mind that there will be departures from the SEDP 2006-2010, especially in the outer years of the
program. One o f the reasons for active engagement is precisely to encourage and support
departures that could further deepen the reform process o fVietnam.

22.      With a sound and sustainable strategy at hand, the challenge now lies in
implementation. Substantive progress will require prioritizing the many policy actions identified
in the SEDP, clarifying their sequence and timing and assessing their possible cost. There is
agreement that prioritization should involve selecting the key reforms within each o f the SEDP
pillars, rather than choosing across pillars. It is also clear that protecting the prudence that has
characterized macroeconomic policy over the last few years and delivering on state sector reform
will be essential to contain the growth of explicit and implicit government liabilities and keep the
overall approach to development financially sustainable. Besides, effective implementation will
also require sound reporting systems that can identify and acknowledge shortcomings, supported
by processes for adjusting policies accordingly. The experience with policy reforms over the
previous cycle is especially relevant in this respect.



                     111.    PROGRESSOVER THE PREVIOUSCYCLE



A.       OVERALL MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE


23.      While neither the SEDP 2001-2005 nor CPRGS had a monitoring framework
attached to it, progress can be gauged along a set of standard indicators. A sound
macroeconomic management is a prerequisite for sustainable growth, and Vietnam did reasonably
well in this respect (Table 1). Economic growth rates have been on a slightly upward trend over
the five-year period. This is not the result o f expansionary policies. Both government spending
and government revenue have gradually increased over time, but the budget balance has remained
fairly stable, at modest levels. Exports have grown vigorously, bringingthe overall trade balance
back to equilibrium after a sizeable deficit towards the middle o f the five-year period. Rapidly
growing FDI, coupled with an expanding ODA program and increased remittances from overseas
Vietnamese have resulted in a current account surplus and a larger volume o f international
reserves.   While inflation accelerated in 2004, this was mainly the result o f supply shocks,
including higher prices for oil and construction materials as well as higher food prices from the
first avian influenza outbreak.    Since then, the growth rate o f banking credit has been on a
decelerating path, mainly due to efforts to improve the quality o f loan portfolios, and the inflation
rate is gradually subsiding.

B.       ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTYREDUCTION



24.      Vietnam's strong economic performance over the last five years is not a mere
reflection of a more favorable international environment. It could indeed be argued that the
regional recovery from the East Asian crisis, rather than homegrown reforms, were the main
determinants o f success.    One way to assess the validity o f this hypothesis is to compare
Vietnam's growth rate to that o f other countries inthe region. To iron out the effect o f short-term
fluctuations and measurement error, three-year moving averages can be used. Also, to take
changes in relative prices into account, several definitions of output can be used, such as GDP per



                                                 8

 capita in local currency at constant prices, in U S dollars at current prices, or in PPP dollars at
 constant prices.      The results o f this exercise are unambiguous: Vietnam's relative position
 improves quite steadily over time, climbing six or seven positions injust a few years (Figure 1,
 left panel). A similar exercise, at the worldwide level, shows that China and a few oil-rich
 countries still do better, but Vietnam climbed some 40 to 60 positions, depending on how growth
 is measured.

 25.      Vietnam's performance is even stronger in relation to poverty reduction, with no
 other country registering faster progress. Admittedly, poverty comparisons across countries
 raise important methodological difficulties, stemming from the fact that both the structure o f
 consumption bundles and the prices o f goods and services differ considerably from one place to
 another. One usual shortcut is to set the poverty line at some intuitively appealing level, such as
 one PPP dollar per day. Based on this measure, between 1990 and 2004 the percentage o f the
 population living in poverty in Vietnam fell by roughly 3 percentage points per year, twice the
 rate o f China (Figure 1, right panel). Adjustments to PPP exchange rates might somewhat modify
 these results, but they are unlikely to lead to substantially different country rankings. Moreover,
 in Vietnam's case the trend is confirmed when using a comparable poverty line, related to the
 consumption bundle (including food and non-food items) necessary to secure a daily food intake
 o f 2,100 calories per person per day.

 26.      Remarkably, the pace at which poverty rates fell accelerated over the last few years.
 As the poverty rate declines, reducing it further becomes more difficult, so that a gradual
 deceleration o f the process could be expected. However, after a slowdown between 1998 and
 2002, the pace at which Vietnam is reducing poverty picked up again. This acceleration could to
 some extent have been amplified by a quirk o f the data. The 2002 household expenditure survey
 was much larger in scale than previous ones, and was conducted with less supervision and
 training o f enumerators.             While the 2004 survey was already o f a better quality, there is a



                                                                  9

possibility that poverty was over-estimated in 2002.          However, it could have been under-
estimated as well. And in any event, tlie apparent acceleration in poverty reduction is consistent
with other developments during tlie period. Output grew faster, the prices of commodities which
are essential to sustain farmers' livelihoods (such as coffee and rice) increased, and tlie volume o f
resources transferred to poorer provinces in tlie context o f decentralization expanded.

27.      However, progress in poverty reduction has been slower for Vietnam's ethnic
minorities. Usinga domestic poverty linethat reflects basic calorie and non-food needs, poverty
among ethnic minorities in Vietnam was still 61 percent in 2004, compared to 14 percent o f the
Kinli and Chinese majority. In some parts of the country, such as tlie South Central Coast,
poverty rates among ethnic minorities are above 90 percent. In 2004, more than one third o f all
ethnic minorities in Vietnam lived in hunger and was unable to meet basic calorie needs.



C.       OTHER DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES



28.      Vietnam has also outperformed many other countries in terms of progress towards
achievingthe MDGs. Five o f tlie ten main MDGtargets set for 2015 have already been attained,
and another four could be reached ahead of time (Table 2).           However, Vietnam might only
partially achieve the target 011 reversing the loss o f environmental resources. Also, it should be
noted that alongside a remarkable performance on nearly all o f tlie MDGs, important disparities
in achievement remain between tlie Kinli majority and ethnic minority groups. For example,
fewer ethnic minority cliildren are enrolled in school, especially girls. Also maternal mortality
and child mortality rates are much higher in mountainous areas where many ethnic minorities live
than in tlie rest of Vietnam.



                            IV.     THE CONTRIBUTIONOFPRSCs



A.       RESOURCESMOBILIZED



29.      Five PRSCs supported the implementationof the economic reforms, including the
CPRGS agenda, over the previous five-year cycle. PRSC 1, a two-tranclie operation for 250
US dollars million, was approved by tlie Board o f Directors o fthe World Bank in June 2001. Its
focus was mainly on tlie structural reform agenda. The second tranche o f PRSC 1 was released in
December 2002. PRSC 2, a one-tranche operation for 100 million U S dollars, was approved in
June 2003. By then, CPRGS liad already been issued, making it possible to broaden considerably
tlie range o f reforms supported by tlie international community.         In addition to the mainly
structural aspects covered by PRSC 1, this second credit included various policy actions aimed at
keeping development inclusive and building modern governance. PRSCs 3 to 5 were also one-
tranche operations o f 100 million US dolalrs each. These were approved in June 2004, 2005 and
2006 respectively and liad a broad sectoral coverage too. In addition to providing resources to the
budget, PRSC operations served as an effective coordination device, supported by an increasingly
large number o f donors. PRSCs have been co-financed by bilateral and multilateral agencies,
either through grants or through parallel lending. More importantly, the process saw a transition
in the role o f co-financiers, from providers o f finance to partners substantially engaged in tlie
preparation o f tlie operations and tlie policy dialogue with government.          This dialogue is


                                                 10

 organized by policy areas, in which donors engage selectively, based on their interests and
technical capacity on the ground.

30.      The PRSC process led to disbursements to the budget on an annual basis, thus
meeting the objective of aligning aid to domestic budget cycles. Since PRSC 2, commitments
were made in June o f each year, which is the time when the preparation o f the budget starts. The
budget is approved by the National Assembly towards November, for the following calendar
year.   The submission to the National Assembly already factors in the amount o f resources
expected from PRSCs. Because such credits are disbursed fully within a few months o f their
signature, PRSCs have been a relatively predictable source o f funds. Disbursements by co-
financiers, either under the form o f grants or parallel lending, take place over a longer period o f
time.  But there was progress in speeding up those disbursements (Table 3).              Because o f the

large fraction o f the resources transferred do not need to be paid back by Vietnam. The total
grant fraction was three quarters towards the end o f the cycle.

3 1.    I n spite of the increasingly large volume of aid resources disbursed through PRSC
operations, the amount was modest compared to financing needs. Some o f the reforms
supported through the PRSC process entail substantial costs to the budget. The restructuring o f
state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) initiated under PRSC 1 led to a phased-in re-
capitalization financed by government bonds. The social safety net to assist workers who become
redundant as a result o f SOE equitization and restructuring became more active over time. The
PRSC process also supported additional spending in the social areas, under the form o f funding
for health expenditures among the poor, and a steady increase in the budget for education. Even
ifall other policy actions under the PRSC process hadbeenbudget-neutral, the additionalcost of
the reforms would be in the range of 300 to 600 million US dollars per year. The total resource
contribution by PRSCs represents less than half o f this amount (Table 4). From this perspective,
general budget support operations can be seen as a cost-sharing arrangement between the
government o f Vietnam and the donor community. The contribution o f general budget support
operations is even more modest when compared to government spending at the aggregate level.
The resources provided represent less than 20 percent o f the total budget deficit, except in 2004,
and less than 2 percent o f total government spending inVietnam.

B.        LESSONSLEARNED


32.      The main contribution of PRSCs has been their ability to serve as a platform for a
continued policy dialogue on a broad range of issues with key government counterparts.
However, given the encompassing nature o f Vietnam's reform program in general, and o f the
CPRGS agenda in particular, progress was not even across all policy areas.         Identifying strong
and weak areas in policy making is essential to ensure the sustainability o f this success over time.
Starting with PRSC 3, a set o f indicators covering a broad range o f policy areas was used to
assess progress. The set o f indicators chosen for this exercise can be questioned. Neither the
previous five-year plan nor the CPRGS had a monitoring and evaluation framework to build
upon. Indicators were then derived from the text o f those documents and from other relevant
sectoral strategies and policy statements.

33.      Overall, progress was slower in policy areas characterized by limited political will,
conflictinginstitutional responsibilities or insufficient analytical work (Table 5).      The speed
at which progress was made across policy areas within each o f these pillars depended on the
political will to implement the reforms. The contrast between rapid progress in the integration
with the world economy and slow reform in the banking sector is revealing in this respect. To
some extent, this contrast may reflect a deliberate choice, whereby rapidly moving towards WTO
accession would be a way to "lock-in" the need for subsequent reforms in the banking sector. In
other cases, as in water, limited progress reflects institutional overlap and unclear delimitation o f
competencies across several ministries or agencies. In the case o f corruption, the commitment to
fight it is undeniable but it is more recent. This is one area where progress on inputs (such as
laws, or coordinating bodies) may take quite some time to translate intro progress on outputs and
outcomes. Beyond the specifics, the classification o f policy areas depending on the progress
made is consistent with the ratings prepared for the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA). Those ratings are above the regional average in relationto macro-economic management
and social inclusion.They are below in relation to the financial sector, labor and social protection,
and transparency and anti-corruption.

34.      One o f the key lessons learned from the previous series o f operations IS the need to have
a comprehensive approach to economic reform. There are important linkages between policy
actions across sectors, so that a piecemeal approach or an excessive selectivity would end up
being less effective. For instance, improving the delivery o f social services requires a better
balancing o f recurrent and capital expenditures on the supply side as well as a gradual move
towards demand-side financing, especially for the poor. Public financial management reform is
thus crucial to deliver better outcomes in education or health. There are also differences in the
readiness o f leadership to embrace change in different areas, with the time o f openings and
accelerations being difficult to predict. This calls for readiness across the entire policy spectrum,
accumulating the various technical building blocks necessary to support more ambitious change
whenever the government endorses it. Finally, the fact that PRSCs are the only vehicle for high-

level policy dialogue in Vietnam puts a higher burden on the contents o f these operations, which
need to serve as a one-stop shop for the interaction between the government and the donor
community.



                                V.       THE NEWPRSC CYCLE



A.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS


35.      The SEDP 2006-2010 clearly spells out the government's priorities and approach to
development for the next five years. It might not be a perfect document, but it is good enough
for the international community to use it as the strategic vision to guide their support to Vietnam.
Indeed, the process leading to the preparation o f the SEDP was open and consultative, the
analysis in the document has a strong focus on social inclusion and poverty reduction, the social
and economic targets established in the document are ambitious but achievable, and a monitoring
framework was set up for the first time. The SEDP 2006-2010 thus offers an opportunity for
upstream harmonization, whereby government and the international community share a common
view o f what needs to be done, in the spirit of the Hanoi Core Statement on aid effectiveness.
Accordingly, the major donors in Vietnam have pledged to align their support strategies to the
SEDP and to assess the results o f their assistance usingthe government's monitoring framework.
Support to the SEDP will involve using a combination of instruments, in addition to PRSCs,
including analytical work, sectoral work and technical assistance (Figure 2).

36.      However, the SEDP is also a comprehensive and ambitious document, dealing with
almost every aspect o f economic reform in Vietnam. Over its more than 300 pages (without
counting the monitoring framework) it discusses development orientations for all sectors and
fields, with varying degrees o f analytical depth and detail. As a result, aligning to a nationally
owned strategy is not as simple in practice as it may sound. A careful analytical "reading" o f the
SEDP is critical to translate it into a concrete set o f policy actions to be implemented during the
new PRSC cycle. Prioritization, sequencing and monitoringare part o f such "reading".

37.      The Vietnam DevelopmentReport 2007, co-signed by 16 donors, providesthe main
analytical underpinnings for the new PRSC series. The preparation o f this report, entitled
Aiming High, started shortly after the approval of the SEDP by the National Assembly. The
report was submitted to the Consultative Group (CG) meeting o f December, 2006 as a
contribution o f the international community to the implementation o f the SEDP. The report built
on the analytical work done over the previous PRSC cycle, on structural reforms (as summarized
in the Vietnam Development Report 2006, on Business), institutional modernization (Vietnam
Development Report 2005, on Governance) and on social inclusion (Vietnam Development
Report 2004, on Poverty). While the process was led by the World Bank, a large number o f
donors participated in it, with several o f them contributing extensive written inputs. Participants
included the co-financiers o f the first PRSC series but also other donors not formally involved in
direct budget support, including the United Nations agencies and international NGOs. A
Reviewing Committee o f recognized Vietnamese experts and policy makers advised on each o f
the policy areas and on the overall thrust o f the report. A background, independent evaluation o f
the first series o f PRSCs, was also commissioned as part o f this process.

B.        STRATEGICFOCUS


38.       The main objective of the proposed series of operations is to help Vietnam develop the
economic policies and institutions needed to become a middle-income country. The goal set by the
SEDP 2006-2010 should not be interpreted merely in quantitative terms, but rather as laying out
regulatory frameworks and monitoring mechanisms well suited to steering a much more complex and
sophisticated economy, with a much broader number o f stakeholders. As the transition to a market
economy i s gradually being completed, the focus needs to shift from basic structural reforms to second-
generation reforms, reflecting both the shift in the role o f government in relation to production and the
changing relationship between state and society. Thus, priority goes to measures aimed at strengthening
the supervision o f financial markets, at regulating access to and pricing o f infrastructure services, at
building inclusive and financially viable social insurance systems, at better managing natural resources
and protectingthe environment, and at increasing transparency and accountability at all levels.

39.       One difficult question faced in preparing the new PRSC series was whether to focus on
selected SEDP pillars or to cover all four. One possible interpretation o fVietnam's recent development
experience holds that success in the long term crucially depends on the acceleration o f structural reforms.
Another possible interpretation is more optimistic about Vietnam's ability to deliver on the structural
reform agenda, but less so in relation to the governance agenda.              However, fostering business
development, keeping growth inclusive, ensuringenvironmental sustainability and improving governance
are all priorities for Vietnam. One o f the strengths o f the reform agenda embraced as a result o f Doi Moi
has been its comprehensive nature. Adopting an "either-or" approach in relation to those key priorities
would be as questionable as choosing between economic reforms and the development o f large-scale
infrastructure in the early stages o f the previous PRSC cycle. Back then, the government o f Vietnam
avoided the pitfall o f such "either-or" approach by pushingtowards the integration o f policy reforms and
infrastructure development, through the "expansion" o f CPRGS. The new PRSC cycle builds on a similar
integration o f perspectives. The Vietnam Development Report 2007 argues that alignment should not be
about emphasizing one pillar o f the SEDP over the others, but rather be about preserving one o f the main
strengths o f Vietnam's reform process, namely its comprehensive, cross-sectoral nature.

40.       Supporting the implementation of Vietnam's reform agenda across its four pillars requires
beingselective within each of them. The SEDP contains long lists o f policy actions to be adopted over
the five-year cycle. It is unlikely that all those actions have the same strategic importance, and even
among priority actions, appropriate sequencing may be the key to success. The previous five-year cycle
provided clear illustrations o f this principle, with accession to the WTO being a pre-requisite to make
politically more difficult decisions in banking a necessity. At a more practical level, there are capacity
constraints, both on the government side and on the donor side. It is often argued that limited government
capacity is one of the main bottlenecks in the implementation o f development programs in Vietnam. But
donor resources (financial and technical) are limited too, and thus cannot possibly support the full range
o f initiatives set out in the SEDP and related plans and strategic documents.

                      BOX 1:GOOD       PRACTICE INPOLICY LENDING             OPERATIONS


           The preparation of this credit, and the broader series of budget support operations for the
  implementation of the SEDP 2006-2010, follows good practice principles on development policy lending. In
 particular, the following issues were considered:

      Government ownership. The objectives of the proposedseries of credits are aligned to those of the SEDP
      2006-2010, a strategic document which is part of mainstream planning processes at national level. The
      SEDP outlines the policy measures needed for Vietnam to advance to middle-income status by the end of
      the decade. The proposed series of credits involves no effectiveness conditions, with all policy actions
      being completed by the time of submissionto the Board. One of the key criteria to retain an action as part
      of the program is that it can be traced back to the SEDP or other key strategic document or plan of the
      government. Triggers for the next operation in the series are discussed with government, and agreed upon
      as a mechanism to focus the policy dialogue, not as disbursement conditions.

      Analytical input. The "translation" of the very comprehensive SEDP into a concrete set of policy actions
      to be implemented during the new PRSC cycle required careful prioritization, sequencing and monitoring.
      The large analytical program supported by the World Bank and other donors, summarized in the annual
      Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs), was used to this effect. After several VDRs addressed in greath
      depth the issues faced by Vietnam in relation to Poverty, Governance and Business, the VDR 2007, co-
      signed by 16 donors, providesthe main analytical underpinningsfor the new PRSC series. Analytical work
      on the social impacts of global integration, on gender, and on environmental issues was also used for the
      design ofthe proposedPRSC series.

      Accountability framework. The size of policy matrices was kept to the minimum compatible with an
     active policy dialogue across the four pillars of the SEDP. The Financing Agreement for PRSC 6 refers to
      12 actions, compared to 15 under PRSC 5 and 14 under PRSC 4. The total number of prior actions is
     similar to that of previous operations. While this number is higher than inother countries, this isjustified in
     Vietnam, given the breadthof its reform programand the maturity reachedby the PRSC process. With two
     dozen line ministries and government agencies and a dozen co-financiers, drastically narrowing the focus of
     the policy dialogue, concentratingonjust a few policy actions would amountto demobilizing a large portion
     of the constituency for economic reform. The Bank and all co-financiers use the same policy matrix to
     decide on their level of support, thereby providing a single harmonizedplatform for the policy dialogue and
     disbursements.

     Performanceorientation. The proposedseries of credits is fully aligned with the budget cycle of Vietnam.
     Commitments will be made in June of each year, which is when the preparation of the budget starts. The
     budget is approved by the National Assembly towards November, for the following calendar year. The
     submission to the National Assembly already factors in the amount of resources expected from PRSCs.
     Progress in the implementation of the reform agenda will be monitored through a well defined set of
     development indicators, with the same framework employed by all co-financiers. Those indicators are
     based on the monitoring framework for the SEDP, althoughthey are fewer in number and have a relatively
     stronger emphasis on governance. The timing for assessments will be aligned to that of the government,
     including the annual report to the National Assembly on the implementation of SEDP, and the mid- and
     end-cyclereviews ofprogress in developmentoutcomes.




41.     As in the previous PRSC cycle, the policy dialogue between donors and government is
broad in nature, encompassing all major policy areas. This comprehensive approach i s justified in
Vietnam, where the PRSC process has reached considerable maturity. With two dozen line ministriesand
government agencies and almost 20 donors participating in it, drastically narrowing the focus of the
policy dialogue, concentrating on just a few policy actions would amount to demobilizing a large portion




                                                         18

o f the constituency for economic reform. Entire sectors could not have any particular anchor to focus
their efforts on, and technical and human resources could end up being under-utilized.

42.      However, havinga broad sectoral coverage is not incompatiblewith identifying a core set of
about a dozen policy actions to be followed much more closely in each operation. The analyses in
the Vietnam Development Report 2007 indicate a series o f priority areas where progress is critically
needed for Vietnam to become a middle-income country and put itself on a sustainable growth path.
Actions in these areas are the only ones included in the Development Credit Agreement. The remaining
ones are discussed in the Program Document, and appropriately documented by government but do not
have legal status. As in previous PRSCs, this compromise allows reconciling a focus on a limited number
o f priorities with the need to make progress across a broader front in order to fully support Vietnam's
ambitious reform agenda.



C.        MONITORING FRAMEWORK


43.      I n parallel, progress in the implementationof the reform agendawill be monitored through
a well defined set of developmentindicators. Those indicators are based      011the monitoring framework
for the SEDP but they are fewer in number (Annex 3). In some areas, the set o f indicators proposed inthe
Vietnam Development Report actually goes beyond the SEDP monitoring framework. This is the case in
relation to governance, where the monitoring experience is more limited and there is a more limited
experience in the use o f enterprise and household surveys, as opposed to administrative self-reporting.
However, because reliable data need to be collected from surveys and other sources with demanding
implementation requirements, the monitoring o f progress towards development outcomes cannot be
conducted on an annual basis. It is expected that the new PRSC cycle will involve some annual
monitoring but only two in-depth assessments, towards the middle o fthe cycle and at the end o f it.



                                      VI.     THE PROPOSED CREDIT



44.      Over the year elapsed since the last operation in the series, the government of Vietnam
made considerable progress in its reform agenda, across all policy areas. Some o f the actions
undertaken during this period are deemed to be more strategic, because o f their potential impact on
development outcomes over time. Those are the actions reported in the Credit Agreement for each o f the
operations (Table 6).        However, as in the previous cycle, each operation highlights through a
comprehensive policy matrix all o f the actions that were part o f the PRSC policy dialogue over the
preceding year and were completed by the time the negotiation o f the credit took place (Annex 2 for the
list and Annex 5 for the supporting documentation). This broader set o f actions does not reflect the use o f
conditionality.   It reporting is rather intended to convey the breadth and scope o f the reforms being
undertaken by the government o f Vietnam, year after year. By providing a more comprehensive picture
o f developments iiieach policy area, this matrix allows a better understanding o f the progress being made
in each o f the four pillars o f the reform program.

Note:    The prior actions listed in this table are those included in the Financing Agreement for the current
         operation. The complete set o f prior actions agreedupon betweengovernment and donors for PRSC 6 can
         be found in Annex 2.



A.       BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT


45.      The drive to integrate further inthe global economy remains one o fthe most important sources o f
reform momentum in Vietnam. In its initial stages, this drive focused mainly on reducingbarriers to trade
in goods, first regionally and then with key trade partners in the industrial world. Subsequently, the
Bilateral Trade Agreement with the United States led to increased coinpetition in services and
considerable legal reform. The trend was furthered deepened, on a multilateral basis, with the accession
to the WTO, which was completed during the period covered by this operation. The most important prior
actions in relation to global integration, under PRSC 6, were the granting o f trading and distribution rights
to all foreign firms, in line with international commitments, and the issuance o f regulations to guide the
intellectual property law, with adequate enforcement mechanisms.

46.      The period covered by this operation witnessed progressin SOE reform, under the form of
more divestitureand better monitoringof performance. The list o f sectors where 100-percent state
ownership is to be retained was further restricted from 29 to 19, and by now covers mainly activities that
can be deemed strategic. This should lead to more SOEs being divested, with the use o f share auctions


                                                        20

now retained as the main mechanism for equitization, and the participation o f foreign strategic investors
allowed. To the extent that the state still retains a share o f the capital in many sectors and enterprises,
additional steps have been taken to ensure that they are managed efficiently. By now, all SOEs are
classified according to their performance, based on their turnover, profitability, servicing o f debts and
compliance with the law, and the results o f this classification are published. Meanwhile, the exercise o f
ownership rights on behalf o f the state is being transferred from line ministries and provincial
governments to the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC), a for-profit organization under the
Prime Minister. This transfer o f ownership should resolve the conflict o f interest that ministries and
provinces used to face, as they formulated and implemented policies affecting the enterprises they ran.

47.      The implementation of the ambitious banking reform strategy adopted under the previous
operation focuses for now on strengthening the commercial orientation of SOCBs, which still
dominate the market at present. The strategy assumed that regulation and technical upgrades alone would
not be sufficient to overcome the interference o f non-commercial objectives in lending decisions,
especially at provincial levels. Introducing private capital in SOCBs, with the participation o f strategic
foreign investors with recognized resources and expertise, was seen as necessary to accomplish this
transformation. Prior actions under this operation prepared the ground for the equitization o f two SOCBs,
including one o f the largest ones, over the next year. The equity stake allowed to foreign strategic
investors was increased, while all SOCBs were required to disclose their financial statements in line with
internationally accepted standards.

48.      Policies to support the development of the already vibrant private sector remain centered
around the removal of administrative barriers to entry. Under this operation, processing times were
reduced and the fee structure for business registration was rationalized. The authority to issue investment
certificates was clarified, more detail was provided    011sectors where investment is conditional, and the
documentation for investment registration or evaluation was standardized. A consultative mechanism to
streamline Iicenses and oversee the implementation o f new investment-enterprise regime was established,
and guidelines and options were issued for foreign investors to transition to such regime. The single-
window mechanism was adopted for businesses to cover registration, tax, and seal formalities in selected
provinces. In parallel a monitoring mechanism to assess the constraints faced by businesses was set up,
under the form o f an investment climate module attached to the enterprise survey every two years. The
sample used for this module is representative at the provincial level, facilitating comparisons in business
friendliness across local authorities.

49.      I n infrastructure, mechanisms are beingset up to increase the efficiency of public resources
and increase the volume of private funding. In relation to public resources, the decentralization o f
investment ownership should lead to a better integration o f capital and recurrent budgets in the road
transport sector. About 40 projects will be transferred to the Vietnam Roads Authority, the entity which
thus far has been responsible for only the maintenance budget. The transfer o f investment ownership is
expected to strengthen the Ministry o f Transport's oversight function, by separating its earlier roles o f
both owner aiid supervisor o f projects. The adoption o f wastewater charges based on cost recovery should
also contribute to the sustainability o f investments in water and sanitation. This measure is accompanied
by appropriate caps to protect the poor. As for private funding, its mobilization for infrastructure projects
should be facilitated by the newly issued BOT decree, which clarifies contract specifications, investor
qualifications aiid treatment o f unsolicited proposals.



B.       SOCIAL INCLUSION


50.      In education,the governmentstrategy expanded coverage of high-quality schooling at lower
levels with competitionand incentives for excellence at higher level. While the coverage o f primary


                                                      21

education has continued to expand, quality remains an issue, with children in poorer areas being at a
disadvantage.    After having introduced Fundamental Quality Standard Levels for schools, under the
previous PRSC cycle, a key prior action under this operation extends performance standards for primary
teachers nationwide. The implementation o f such standards will rely on evidence-based assessments o f
teacher performance, as opposed to diplomas and seniority. At the higher end, transparent criteria have
been adopted to decide on university admission quotas on a pilot basis.

5 1.     A fundamental transformation in the government's approach to HIV/AIDS has taken place
in recent years and is being consolidated at present. Risky behaviors, including the practice o f
commercial sex and the use o f intravenous drugs were traditionally labeled as "social evils", often
resulting in stigma and discrimination for the affected populations.            But the approach changed
considerably under the previous cycle, with a new strategy emphasizing prevention and treatment over
repression. This public health approach i s reflected in the HIV/AIDS law passed under this operation,
and the subsequent preparation o f a comprehensive set o f action plans to scale up harm reduction. These
action plans foresee the introduction o f needle exchange and methadone substitution programs.
Meanwhile, across tlie health sector as a whole, an effort was undertaken to improve the budgetary
balance between health infrastructure, human resources, subsidies and preventive care.

52.      The design o f the pension program was improved, so as to extend its coverage and make its
compulsory component financially viable. Until tlie mid-l990s, only public sector workers were entitled
to old-age, disability and survivor benefits, under a non contributory program funded out o f general
government resources. This program was subsequently extended on a contributory basis to all formal
sector workers, but old-age pension benefits remained determined by average salaries in the years
preceding retirement. The period covered by this credit saw the passing o f the first ever Social Insurance
Law was passed, which makes pension benefits for private sector workers depend on the average salary
over all the years o f contribution. In a rapidly growing economy, this average salary is substantially
lower than the salary in the years preceding retirement, so that the law drainatically improved the
financial viability o f the system. It also introduced a voluntary pension program for farmers and informal
sector workers, making it possible to gradually extend the coverage o f the social insurance system. This
voluntary program is currently in its design phase. However, the stronger financial viability o f the system
and its potentially broader coverage should not hide the shortcomings o f current pension formulas. Under
the new law, there are considerable gaps between the level o f benefits for men and women, and for public
and private sector workers.       Also, benefits are far removed from the actuarial benchmark, which
encourages relatively short periods o f contribution and the under-reporting o f earnings.

53.      While gender equality indicators are better in Vietnam than in many other developing
countries, steps are being taken to narrow the remaining gaps. The passing o f a law on gender
equality, a prior action under this operation, is an important step in this direction. It is recognized that
regulation alone cannot be sufficient, as abuses go often unreported and enforcement capacities are
limited. But the new law unifies legal framework to address gender disparities and increases women's
participation in decision making.



C.       NATURALRESOURCES


54.      The SEDP gave increase prominenceto development sustainability, and the latter hinges to
a large extent on the management of natural resources. Two main issues stand out in relation to land.
First, is the management o f forests, which are still to a large extent under the control o f SFEs. This has
resulted in a blurring o f commercial and protective functions, but there is also a risk that SFE
restructuring could lead to the encroaching o f forest land by outsiders, to the detriment o f local



                                                      22

populations (especially from ethnic minorities) whose livelihoods depend to a large extent on the use o f
forests as a public good. To address this risk, under this operation the government issued a strategy to
strengthen linkages between protective and economic functions o f forests, and to promote ownership by
local households and communities.

55.     The second critical issue faced by Vietnam in relation to land management concerns conversion,
reclamation and resettlement, in the context o f a rapid urbanization process. Close to one million people
may be moving every year to urban and peri-urban areas, and entire swatches o f land are being cleared for
infrastructure development or to host industrial parks.         Lack o f transparency in reclamation and
conversion plans may result in sizeable capital gains for those with access to tlie relevant information.
Insufficient compensation for the affected populations is leading to recurrent social unrest. The Land
Law, approved under the previous PRSC series, paved the way for the use o f market prices as the basis
for compensation.     But gaps remained in relation to land occupants who do not have appropriate
documentation for their tenure, something common in a country where the handing over o f land to
households and firms is still an ongoing process. Under this operation, resettlement and compensation
procedures have been clarified for cases where occupants lack a land-use right certificate (LUCs), and
meclianisms have been set up to handle complaints.

56.     Development sustainability also hinges on the appropriate control o f pollution and environmental
damage resulting from business activity, be it by the public or the private sector. Considerable progress
was made during the previous cycle on the use o f Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for large
investment projects. Under this operation, consultation with the communities where projects are to be
located became mandatory, and the local feedback needs to be incorporated when reporting back to the
relevant authorities.



D.      MODERNGOVERNANCE


57.     The transformation of planning processes, from the direct allocation of resources to the
strategic steering of the economy, has continued during this period. In tlie command and control
economy, M P I would play the role o f an arbiter in the selection o f investment projects submitted by
various government bodies. With investment decisions devolved to the National Assembly and People's
CounciIs, the role o f M P I has shifted towards the allocation o f the budget envelope available for capital
expenditures. In the period covered by this operation, norms were adopted to allocate state capital
expenditure transparently across provinces, using criteria like population, poverty and ethnicity. These
norms make a considerably larger amount o f resources available to the poorer provinces in the country.
Also during this period regulations were adopted for the preparation o f regional development plans,
specifying responsibilities and requiring disclosure. Under the new regulations, infrastructure master
plans will have to be based on the broader, regional development plans. Thanks to the new approach,
issues such as comparative advantage, land use and population flows are expected to gain more
prominence in choosing the layout for infrastructure networks.

58.     Public financial management reform, one of the cornerstones of the Vietnamese program,
has focused on strengthening systems and increasing transparency. The State Audit o f Vietnam had
been established as a specialized agency under the National Assembly towards the end o f the previous
cycle. Under this operation, for the first time tlie results o f SAV audits and its annual audit plan were
disclosed. This period also witnessed the publication o f the report on budget execution for the current
year and tlie budget plan for forthcoming year, which will happen on an annual basis hereafter. In the
same spirit, regulations were issued for the periodic disclosure o f external public debt and its
composition.   This signals an increased emphasis on the management o f resources and liabilities,



                                                     23

compared to a previous focus on public expenditures. Thus, a regulation to guide the establishment and
issuance o f benchmark government bonds was implemented, and the administration procedures for all
taxes were consolidated into a single law, modernizing assessmentand enforcement methods.

59.     Increased oversight of government actions, at both national and local levels, has been a
common theme underlying the legal reforms adopted under this operation. The National Assembly
has become increasingly active in its supervisory role, especially since the passing o f the Budget Law o f
2002. This trend was reinforced recently with the establishment o f separate legal, judicial, economic, and
budget committees. These committees are also expected to include a greater proportion o f permanent
members than in the past. A similar trend is noticeable at local levels. A new ordinance on grassroots
democracy strengthens information disclosure, public participation, and accountability o f officials in the
preparation and implementation o f commune level policies. Recent legal developments have also aimed
at promoting access to justice and recognizing civil society organizations. Under this operation, legal aid
mechanisms for marginalized and vulnerable groups were simplified and broadened, whereas policies
were adopted to encourage the participation o f non-state establishments inthe delivery o f public services.

60.     The determined approach taken by the government in relation to corruption is at present
moving into an implementation phase. Key legal documents, including the pivotal Anti-Corruption
Law, have been passed by now, and the issue is how to translate a clear resolve into concrete action.
Several measures adopted during the period covered by this credit go in that direction. A Steering
Committee against corruption, headed by the Prime Minister, has been set up. The committee has the
power to suspend high-level officials if suspected o f wrongdoing. It is already engaged in investigating
certain high profile cases, and the findings are to be made public. The results of investigations against
corruption for cases overseen by the Government Inspectorate were disclosed. A legal framework has
also been established to protect and reward whistle blowing on corrupt activities.



E.      TRIGGERS FOR PRSC 7


61.     The negotiation o f the proposed credit included reaching an agreement on a list o f measures that
will in principle be supported by PRSC 7. These measures are inspired in the SEDP 2006-2010 and other
key documents and strategies (last column in Annex 2).           But among that broader set, the measures
discussed at the negotiation phase stand out by their strategic importance to attain the SEDP objectives
towards the end o f the five-year cycle (Table 7). Those priority measures, or "triggers", should not be
interpreted as conditions. They rather serve as a guide to focus the policy dialogue towards PRSC 7.
Progress towards meeting the triggers will be assessed towards the end o f 2007 in order to launch the
formal preparation o f the next operation in the series. It is understood that the assessment will be holistic,
recognizingthat some triggers may not be fully met while other may be exceeded.

62.     Establish early warning mechanisms to address the social and environmental impacts of
WTO accession. While the entry o f Vietnam into the WTO is bound to accelerate economic growth, it
may do so at uneven paces across regions and sectors. Early analytical work on the possible social
impacts o f accession showed how difficult it is to predict which specific groups stand to lose, or to be left
behind. In the few cases where adverse impacts can be anticipated with a relative degree o f precision,
complementary measures to protect those who could be affected should be part o f the action plans to
implement WTO commitments.          Such action plans are currently under preparation and should be
completed by end-2007. I n most cases, however, it is easier to identify the groups which stand to lose
than to determine how much they could lose (or even whether they would actually lose). In those cases,
the action plans sl~ouldestablish effective communication channels with the relevant stakeholders, to
inform them about the possible impacts o f WTO and collect timely feedback from them.

63.      Assess transparency and scope of related lending and affiliated party transactions of
Economic Groups. The reform o f the state sector has been effective in introducing private capital in
SOEs, improving their governance, and removingthe exercise o f state rights in them from policy agencies
to a profit-oriented asset manager (the SCIC). But several large economic groups directly reporting to the
Prime Minister, by virtue o f their size and sectoral diversification, potentially raise new corporate
governance problems that need to be carefully assessed. Of particular concern is the possibility o f
affiliated party transactions within the groups, especially as some o f them want to take savings deposits
directly from the public. This could lead to financial transactions not falling under the direct oversight of
either SBV or the State Securities Commission (SSC). Also, some o f these groups are organized around
infrastructure networks, as in the case o f electricity and telecommunications. Promoting competition in
sectors with network externalities requires a deliberate effort to create a market, and progress is uneven in
this respect.

64.      Complete equitization of two SOCBs, with participation of strategic investors. The
equitization o f all SOCBs is part o f the banking reform strategy. But it may fail to strengthen their


                                                       25

commercial orientation if private ownership is scattered across a large number o f small investors.
Strategic investors with a solid trajectory in banking are needed to strengthen the credit culture inside the
SOCBs and counteract the pressures for directed lendingthey often face at local levels. The low ceilings
in force for participation by individual foreign investors could be dissuasive in a different economic
environment. But Vietnam's dynamism could still make a minority stake in an SOCB valuable enough to
attract interest by reputable international banks.       The government could further encourage their
involvetnent by raisingthe ceiling for individual foreign investors to its allowed maximum.

65.     Adopt market based pricing systems for cost estimates related to state-funded civil
engineeringinvestments. A vibrant private sector has emerged in recent years, but the market for civil
works remains dominated by SOEs (equitized or not). As a result, collusion is difficult to avoid, even
when competitive bidding is used to allocate contracts. Equally important, SOEs and former SOEs tend
to use the cost norms o f the public sector when formulating their bids. This results in limited price
variation across bids, which cannot be easily distinguished from deliberate coll~ision. Because the cost
norms are outdated, they also lead to the exclusion o f higher-quality bids. The acceptance o f such
proposals requires exceptions which are in turn vulnerable to corruption. The revision o f the cost norms
system, so that cost estimates better reflect market conditions, is a crucial measure to make the market for
civil works more competitive and transparent.

66.     Revise tuition fees at secondary and tertiary levels, better reflectingmarket conditions while
protecting the poor. The education strategy o f Vietnam combines broad access to high-quality
schooling at primary and lower secondary levels, with increased competition and a drive for excellence at
higher levels. However, for higher-level institutions to be able to provide quality education, they need
more resources than the education budget can afford, and stronger performance incentives than it can
provide. At the same time, there is a clear recognition that mechanisms need to be set up to exempt the
poor from higher tuition fees and to provide scholarships for talented children from disadvantaged
backgrounds.

67.     Establish affordable health insurance premiums based on user-group demand and address
adverse selection problem. The strategy for the reform of the health sector relies on a move from
supply- to demand-side financing o f health care providers, with budget funding for the poor and partial
subsidies for the near poor. The expansion o f the health insurance program, and in particular the passing
o f the Health Insurance Law currently under preparation, are cornerstones in this process.         For this
strategy to work in practice, however, the Health Insurance Law needs to strengthen provider payment
mechanisms, so as to create incentives for the containment o f health costs. At present, reimbursement to
providers is on a fee-for-service basis. The new Law should also set the contribution rate towards health
insurance at a level that does not penalize formal sector employment, resisting the temptation to balance
the books through an excessively high rate. Last but not least, the adverse selection problem faced by the
voluntary health insurance program needs to be addressed, which probably requires greater reliance on
group enrollment and a more active role o f local authorities and inass organizations in promoting
participation inthe system.

68.     Introducevoluntary pension program for farmers and informal sector, with support for the
poor. The development o f a modern social insurance system is less advanced in relation to old-age,
survivor and disability pensions than it is in relation to health insurance. However a similar approach is
gradually taking shape, as reflected in the first ever Social Insurance Law in mid-2006. This law made
the compulsory pension system financially viable, although this was at the price of sizeable gaps between
the level o f benefits allowed and what an actuarially fair program would provide. The Social Insurance
Law also introduced a voluntary pension program for farmers and informal sector workers, whose
specifics will need to be spelled out in the coming months. Two main challenges stand out. The first one
is to make the program "portable", as Vietnam will most likely experience a considerable formalization o f




                                                      26

employment as it develops. Tlie second challenge is to allow for subsidies or incentives to encourage the
participation o f the poor, a vast majority o f whom would otherwise remain uncovered.

69.      Adopt guidelines for Gender Equality Law identifying responsibilities, resources and
monitoring mechanisms. Tlie law passed under this operation redresses gender gaps in existing
regulations and increases participation by women in decision making. It would be unrealistic to expect
that a legal framework can on its own solve problems that go often unreported and are difficult to
monitor.    However, there is a clear expectation that the law can make a difference if properly
implemented. This requires identifying clearly which agencies are in charge, allocating resources so that
they can conduct their tasks, and establishing mechanisms to assess progress.

70.      Issue guidelines for forest development based on participatory land-use planning and
independent monitoring. Environmental sustainability will depend not only on the control o f pollution
but also, crucially, on the adequate management o f natural resources. Forest land is among the most
sensitive o f such resources, with implications for both biodiversity and the livelihoods o f local
populations. After tlie adoption o f the forest strategy, the next step is to involve local stakeholders in land-
use planning to reach consensus on tlie location o f plantations, allocation o f forest land, and to identify
boundaries with other uses o f land. Better site mapping and species matching, as well as improved
monitoring o f forest cover and quality will be additional areas o f importance.

71.       Enact legal and institutional framework for integrated river basin management and
develop unified national sanitation strategy and encourage greater commune and private
participation in sanitation. Adequate management o f water resources is another priority, as potential
tensions exist between their upstream and downstream uses. The most serious obstacle in this respect is
institutional, as actions by various ministries, agencies and provinces need to be coordinated in each case.
It is thus necessary to clarify the legal and institutional framework through which all o f them must
operate. The forthcoming decree on integrated river basin management will be a key milestone in this
process. Sanitation represents the only MDG where progress has been less than expected. Previous
operations supported actions in the area o f rural sanitation. However, in a rapidly urbanizing economy
fringe areas are emerging where the urban-rural divide is blurred. In order to adequately respond to the
sanitation needs o f all groups and regions a unified national strategy is currently under development. The
strategy entails close cooperation among various ministries, and also aims to attract private participation
in the provision o f sanitation services.

72.      Establish clear criteria for selecting public investment projects and mechanisms for their
financing and monitoring. In recent years there has been a sustained trend towards transferring
responsibilities for public investment decisions outside o f MPI, to ministries, provinces and elected
bodies. However, a common framework for the preparation, appraisal, financing and implementation o f
public investment projects is still missing. Such framework should strengthen the project cycle at all
levels, from the consistency with broader master plans, to the reliance on some form o f cost-benefit
analysis, to the estimation of operation and maintenance costs, to the enforcement o f safeguard
mechanisms in relation to the environment and affected populations, to transparency in funding and
financial management and to the monitoring and supervision o f works.

73.      Issue disclosure regulations on content and timing of SAV report including audits of
individual entities. While tlie results o f audits conducted by the SAV and its annual audit plan were
disclosed for the first time under the current operation, a regular routine still needs to be established and
the extent o f disclosure needs to be enhanced. Among other issues, such routine should ensure access by
authorized agencies, including the media, for the detailed audit report, including the audits o f individual
entities.




                                                       27

74.      Implement asset declaration by senior officials and their immediate families with penalties
for non-compliance. The Anti-Corruption Law passed under the previous operation in the cycle
introduced an asset monitoring mechanism, whose specifics were spelled out more recently in a decree on
asset an income declaration. While this could be a critically important tool to identify wrongdoers and
dissuade corrupt behavior, its effectiveness will very much depend on its implementation in practice. One
important unknown i s the number o f declarers to monitor; if the number i s unmanageably large, the
declaration process may simply amount to paperwork. Equally important is to determine whether those in
charge o f verification are sufficiently removed from the declarers so as to avoid a conflict of interest.



                               VII.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION



A.       POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS


75.     A reform program as ambitious and comprehensive as the one envisioned by Vietnam for
the next five years could have adverse impacts on specific groups. In the short run, activities which
were previously protected may stand to suffer from increased competition. In the medium to long term,
some groups could benefit more than others from accelerated economic growth. However, while both
possibilities are compelling, clearly identifying which groups stand to lose, or to gain less, i s not
straightforward. For instance, a thorough review o f findings in relation to the impacts o f WTO accession,
conducted as part o f the Vietnam Development Report 2006, on Business, showed that most o f the
predicted impacts were not robust. This inability to clearly anticipate who the potential losers are raised
important methodological issues in relation to the handling o f the poverty and social impacts o f the
economic reform program being supported.

76.     To address this fundamental uncertainty, a combination of preventive measures and rapid
response mechanisms has been gradually established. One important preventive measure is the
extension o f the safety net for redundant SOE workers beyond its initial expiration date, in 2006. This
safety net, whose operation has received positive evaluations, i s also being extended to other categories o f
public sector personnel, namely redundant workers in state-owned farmers, forests and plantations.
Another preventive measure is the creation o f an unemployment insurance program by the first ever
Social Insurance Law, passed in 2006. This program is not scheduled to be formally launched until2010.
But in the event o f an unexpected increase inthe unemployment rate, it should be feasible to accelerate its
implementation, and to grandfather workers who lose their jobs as a result o f restructuring, even if they
had not contributedto the program, or had not contributed long enough.

77.     Rapid response mechanisms rely on a more robust measurement of poverty rates, a better
understandingof its determinants, and the availability of budget allocation normschanneling more
resources to poorer areas. The last poverty assessment led by the donor community was the Vietnam
Development Report 2004, on Poverty. Since then, the responsibility for such assessments has been
gradually handed over to a team o f local researchers and practitioners, led by the Vietnamese Academy o f
Social Sciences (VAS'S).        This team is also the main advisor on the implementation o f WTO
commitments and will be working on identifying the most appropriate complementary measures to
mitigate potentially adverse effects o f those commitments.      The task also involves establishing clear
procedures to collect feedback from relevant stakeholders in each case. Local analytical work on poverty
has been accompanied by a strengthening o f its measurement at various levels, resulting in poverty rates
which are reliable at the province level, and improving at district and commune levels. Meanwhile, a
system o f norms to allocate budget resources to provinces was completed in 2006. These norms are



                                                     28

sensitive to poverty, making it possible to channel more government resources to areas which are
adversely hit, or simply lag behind in terms of poverty.

78.      I n the medium to long term, addressing the potentially adverse social impacts of rapid
economic reforms requiresa strengtheningof governmentsystems. One of the objectives of the five-
year period ahead is to develop a modern social insurance system, starting by health benefits and
gradually moving to old-age pensions, disability pensions and the like. The approach in this respect is to
aim for universal coverage, relying on programs with the same structure of benefits for all population
groups, but with the contributions or premia of the poor being paid out of the state budget. Another area
where progress is expected concerns regional planning. Until recently, regional planning was not too
different from producing infrastructure master plans. But there is now a clear determination to ground
regional planning inore firmly on considerations related to comparative advantage, land and water use,
labor migration and the like. If done properly, this work should result in more coherent regional
development policies, helping the laggard areasto catch up with inore prosperous neighbors.



B.       ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS


79.      The proposed PRSC series supports a number of diverse policy actions which could have
effects on the country's environment, forests and other natural resources. Most of those effects are
expected to be positive, but some could be negative. Among the actions with the largest potential impact
on environmental quality are those related to private sector development, SOE reform, trade integration,
and planning processes. Rather than trying to address those potential impacts one by one, the approach
taken in Vietnam is to mainstream environmental objectives in the PRSC process. This approach has led
to the adoption and implementation of legal framework for land (Land Law, 2003), forests (Forest
Protection and Development Law, 2005) and environmental inanageinent (amended Law on
Environmental Protection, 2006). The next series of PRSCs will strengthen the iinpleinentationof these
legal frameworks to ensure greater impact on the ground.

80.      Supporting analytical work has been engaged to identify and address gaps in the existing
arrangements and incentives for environmental governance. A Poverty-Environment Nexus analysis
helped raise awareness on the interaction between environmental issues and poverty. Its findings have
resulted in increasedattention on pollution in rural areas and its impact on people`s health. The Country
Environniental Analysis highlighted the need to regulate non-state rural enterprises contributing to water
pollution. The Environment Monitor series provides a regular snapshot by thematic area, including solid
waste, biodiversity and water quality in river basins. Other studies by the World Bank and other donors
have helped fill the gap between SEDP objectives and policy actions supported by the PRSC process.

81.     Among the policy actions being adopted, several focus directly on pollution control, others
on natural resource management and others on investment planning. The general decree to guide
iinpleinentation of the Law on Environmental Protection was been issued in August 2006, during the
period covered by this operation. The decree focuses on the application of national environmental
standards, and allocates responsibilities for environmental protection in the production and service
sectors, as well as in relation to hazardous waste management. The Circular on Wastewater Pollution
Coefficients, identifying the volume of pollutants in industrialwastewater as a basis for fees to be levied
in application of the "polluter pays" principle, also came into force during the period covered by this
operation, in July 2006. A Decree on solid waste management was approved in early 2007, and a new
decree on wastewater disposal for urban areas and industrial zones is expectedto be issued soon.

82.      In relation to natural resources management, an important step towards implementing the 2005
Forest Protection and Development Law is the approval of the National Forest Development Strategy for


                                                    29

2006-20 10 which strengthens the linkages between protection and economic functions o f forests. This i s
accomplished through improved forestland tenure, particularly for communities, an enhanced contribution
o f forestry to economic growth and local livelihoods, and a more sustainable management and
conservation o f the forest estate. A country-wide reclassification o f forest, coupled with the reform o f
state forestry enterprises (SFEs), is underway, sliould lead to the handover o f a larger area o f production
forest to local households and communities. Accompanying policies for production forests are also under
the preparation. Participatory land-use planning will be used to ensure that the expanded production
forest estate is allocated equitably, managed in a sustainable way, and contributes to environment
protection. Furthermore, the Five Million Hectare Program i s being revised to better balance forest
protection, multi-purpose forestry and incentives for farmer participation.

83.      In the water sector, steady progress is being made on promoting integrated river basin
management. One o f the major obstacles to progress in this area was the overlap in responsibilities
between government agencies.         Those responsibilities were clarified in 2007, when the Ministry o f
Natural Resources and the Environment (MONRE) was given the coordinating role and the mandates o f
the Ministry o f Home Affairs (MOHA), MONRE and the Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural Development
(MARD) were revised accordingly. It is expected that the decree formalizing the new, streamlined
institutional framework for integrated river basin management will be enacted it1 the second half o f 2007.
Lessons from the pilots will be incorporated into the development o f detailed implementation guidelines
for strategic environment assessments (SEAS). Downstream, mandatory consultation with local
communities has been introduced during this PRSC period for investment projects requiring an EIA.
Consultation guidelines are in preparation for hydropower projects.

84.      The government i s undertaking a substantial program of environmental capacity building.
This program includes institutional strengthening, environmental and land use planning, and physical
investment projects addressing environmental issues. Donor assistance to Vietnam is strong in these
areas, particularly for some o f the issues addressed through the PRSC process, such as improvements in
environmental policies and their implementation, pollution prevention and control, and sustainable
management o f forest and water resources.



C.       STEERING AND MONITORING


85.      The National Steering Committee (NSC) for the implementation of PRSC operations was
established in 2002. It is chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister, Nguyen Sinh Hung, and brings
together representatives from key economic ministries and agencies, such as MOF, the Ministry o f Trade
(MOT), the State Bank o f Vietnam (SBV), the Ministry o f Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA),
the Ministry o f Justice (MOJ), MARD, the Ministry o f Education and Training (MOET) and the Ministry
o f Health (MOH), among others. Members o f the NSC thus have authority over the entire range o f policy
areas covered by the PRSC process. The participation o f the Office o f Government (OOG) and the
Party's Economic Commission (PEC) in the NSC also allow for a better coordination o f policy decisions,
and to elicit sufficient support for the most critical reforms. SBV is assigned as the agency responsible, in
close collaboration with the World Bank, for preparation and implementatioti o f PRSCs. A Deputy
Governor o f SBV acts as Standing Vice Chairman o fthe NSC. Representatives from a total o f more than
20 line ministries and government agencies participated inthe preparation o fthe proposed credit.

86.      Given the intensive and complex coordination that is required to manage this very comprehensive
reform program, SBV has created a Program Coordination Unit (PCU) with dedicated staff from SBV.
The PCU has helped facilitate the policy dialogue o f the World Bank and donors with line ministries.




                                                        30

The Department for International Development o f the United Kingdom (DFID), Switzerland (SECO) and
the World Bank have provided financial support for the PCU duringthe preparation o f PRSCs 4 to 6.



D.        ADMINISTRATION


87.       Strengthening the management of public expenditures has been a priority of the
Government over the last decade and significant progress has been made in this respect. A first
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was undertaken in 2000-0 1. A Public Expenditure
Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA) carried out in 2004 and published in 2005, provided
an update and review o f the implementation o f the recommendations o f the 2001-CFAA and also
suggested reforms in other areas. The government has made steady progress in implementing the 2004
PER-IFA recommendations. Major developments in public financial management include empowering
the National Assembly with increased government accountability for the use o f public resources;
increasing transparency for all agencies using budget resources, including SOEs, public investment
projects and statutory funds; establishing the SAV as a technically independent unit under the National
Assembly; and gradual integration o f capital and recurrent expenditures through forward-looking budgets
and resource allocation norms. Twenty-six national private sector accounting and 37 auditing standards,
consistent with international practice have been issued. The government is currently undertaking a major
investment in a new and integrated Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS).
Progress is being made in developing new business processes for TABMIS, including a unified Chart o f
Accounts, further integration o f recurrent and capital budget execution processes, clarifying issues related
to reporting O D A on budget, and developing standard reports to strengthen budget execution.

88.       A CFAA Update has been commenced and will be available later in 2007. The Update will
provide an assessment o f the public financial management through examining budget development,
budget execution    -accounting, internal and external reporting, internal controls, internal and external
auditing, monitoring and legislative oversight and scrutiny, financial management capacity and financial
accountability risks.

89.       Disbursement, reporting and auditing arrangements. The Credit will follow the International
Development Association (IDA) disbursement procedures for development policy lending operations, and
the Credit proceeds will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release conditions. Various
measures have been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions are adequate to
proceed with support from IDA and other development partners. Analytical underpinnings for the
operation include the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), the 2005 PER-IFA and
the CFAA under preparation.        Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will have to be satisfied.

90.      Fiduciary arrangements. The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management
systems, (budgeting, accounting, reporting and auditing) are assessed as moderate.                Since the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not currently have a program in Vietnam, it is not possible to
rely on its assessment o f the control environment o f the SBV. However, the enactment o f the Audit Law
o f 2005 helps address the issues related to audit and accounting arrangements. The Audit Law has
established the SAV as an independent institution reporting the National Assembly with the Auditor
General being appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly. Audit reports were made public for
the first time in 2006. The SBV will be subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis.

91.      Deposit account. To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control environment, the
Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated deposit account (DA) in US dollars for the Borrower's use
once the Credit i s approved by the Board. The DA will form part o f the country's official foreign



                                                     31

reserves. A n equivalent amount will be credited to an account o f the government available to finance
budgeted expenditures. If after deposit in the DA the proceeds o f the Credit or any part thereof are used
for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to
either return that amount to the DA to be usedfor eligible purposes, or refund the amount directly to IDA.

92.     Through SBV, the Borrower will report the exact sum received into the DA, ensure that all
withdrawals are for "eligible" expenditures, indicate to IDA details o f the Treasury account to which the
Vietnamese Dong equivalent o f the Credit proceeds will be credited, and submit a report on receipts and
disbursements for the DA. The Government will, if considered necessary by IDA, allow an independent
external audit o f the dedicated foreign currency DA. These processes and controls are intended to
provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their intended destination to be used for their intended
purposes, and are subject to the Borrower's rules and regulations.


E.      BENEFITSAND RISKS


93.     The present operation is a vehicle for the World Bank, and the donor community more
broadly, to stay engaged with a client that has delivered an outstanding performancein terms of
economic growth and poverty reduction. It also recognizes the commitment of the government to
pursue and deepen its reform strategy, as reflected over the last few months in major milestones,
including the entry into the WTO, the approval o f an ambitious banking reform roadmap and the adoption
o f a determined stance in the fight against corruption.          Active engagement should strengthen the
coherence o f the program, especially because the effectiveness o f sectoral policy actions hinges on the
success o f more fundamental governance reforms in areas such public financial management, public
administration reform and legal and judiciary development. Engagement should also help improve the
content o f specific policy actions, to ensure the timeliness o f their adoption, and to monitor the impact o f
the overall program on broader development outcomes. The value o f this engagement i s all the more
important given that this would be the last cycle o f general budget support operations in concessional
terms, hence providing an exceptional window for high-level policy access in a country that i s not aid
dependent.

94.     At the same time, its own success confronts Vietnam with new challenges. The reform
agenda has not progressed at the same pace across all fronts, and private sector response has been much
stronger in some areas than in others. As a result, the country is facing potentially dangerous imbalances.
The biggest risks faced by Vietnam are related to the sustainability o f its remarkable performance,
economically, socially and institutionally.

95.     Three different risks of a diverse nature needto be considered. In the short term, the biggest
vulnerability stems from possible turbulence in the financial sector. The development o f capital markets
has vastly outpaced that o f the supervisory and regulatory capacity o f monetary authorities. This calls for
a rapid upgrading o f policies related to the banking sector, the securities market and the management o f
public debt, all o f which are part o f the proposed reform program. Success in global integration, resulting
in massive inflows o f FDI to the growth poles o f the country and increased competition in formally
protected sectors, may also test the ability o f Vietnam to preserve social inclusion. There is a risk that
some groups could lose in the short term, and a clear prospect o f a widening urban-rural gap. Rapid
feedback channels from affected stakeholders, inclusive policies in the social sectors, and transparent
mechanisms to transfer resources to the poorer regions are among the mitigating measures supported by
the proposed series o f operations. Other imbalances are related to rapid urbanization and infrastructure
development, in a context where transparency in land zoning and land compensation are still partial.
Cases o f corruption and social strife are increasingly related to land. Tackling this risk requires rapid
progress in transparency at various levels, from regional planning to infrastructure master plans to land



                                                       32

use to appropriate taxation to the monitoring o f assets o f the relevant civil servants. These are also areas
receiving special attention in the proposed series o f operations.



                VIII.     COORDINATIONWITH DONORSAND STAKEHOLDERS



A.       THE IMF



96.      The IMF has not had a lending arrangement in Vietnam since the expiry o f its Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) in April 2004. However, the IMF remains fully committed to continuing an
effective partnership with the government o f Vietnam. It maintains a regular policy dialogue with the
government through Article IV consultations, interim staff visits, and its resident representative office in
Hanoi, and seeks to build capacity through training activities in Vietnam and abroad. It supplements this
dialogue with technical assistance in areas o f core Fund expertise, including tax policy and
administration, budget management, monetary and financial sector policy, and macroeconomic statistics.
The IMF continues to cooperate closely with the World Bank inVietnam, and to contribute actively to the
broader dialogue between the government and its development partners. In relation to the proposed
credit, the IMF is expected to provide a Letter o f Assessment before the Board Meeting. A joint Bank-
Fund DSA was completed in October 2006.

97.      Under the framework o f enhanced collaboration, the staffs o f the two institutions have consulted
closely with one another across a broad range o f issues, and have sought to maintain appropriately-
aligned positions in their areas o f policy engagement. While the World Bank has taken the lead in
supporting the government's structural and institutional reforms in a number o f sectors, the IMF has taken
the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies.           It has also assumed responsibility for
advising on the monetary policy functions o f the SBV.



B.       OTHERMULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL DONORS



98.      A total o f 11 bilateral and multilateral donors co-financed operations in the previous PRSC cycle,
and more are expected to contribute to this and subsequent credits (see Table 8). Apart from co-financing
PRSC operations, bilateral and multilateral donors have played an important role through their
involvement in the policy dialogue with the government. Donors participating in the process contributed
human and financial resources to assess the policy challenges, coordinate their approaches, and discuss
the options with government, across a range o f policy areas. These were chosen in accordance with their
priorities and comparative strengths.

99.     The preparation of this credit was conducted in a joint manner since its inception, with regular
donor meetings taking place to reach consensus on how to proceed. The initial stage involved the joint
preparation o f a major piece of analytical work, the Vietnam Development Report 2007, entitled Aiming
High. This report, presented at the CG Meetingof December 2006, sought to "translate" the SEDP 2006-
2010 into a workable set of policy actions, with proper prioritization and sequencing. It also led to the



                                                       34

identification o f a set o f indicators to monitor progress towards development outcomes across all pillars
o f the reform agenda. The preparation o f the Vietnam Development Report was launched shortly after
the approval o f PRSC 5, in June 2006. Several donors contributed think pieces and background notes all
over the process, and especially in preparation for a major workshop in October, 2006. In the end, the
Vietnam Development Report was co-signed by 16 multilateral and bilateral donors.

100.      Preparations for PRSC 6 have built on the foundations o f the existing strong donor commitment
to support Vietnam's reform agenda in a coordinated manner. This commitment was re-asserted in the
Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness. It is reflected in the intense meeting frequency o f the
different working groups that were established to coordinate the views o f co-financiers and share
information pertaining to the PRSC process.            Joint working groups o f donors, government and
international NGOs that meet on a regular basis have helped carry the discussions on government's plans
for reforms to a wide group o f stakeholders. With the formation o f working groups organized by policy
area, donors have had the opportunity to engage in discussions on reform with government counterparts
on an ongoing basis. Such an arrangement is also helpingto ensure coherence across donors' programs o f
support, and to mobilize funding for high priority tasks in each policy area.

101.      Building on the effective way donors have worked together in the preparation o f PRSCs in
Vietnam, and on their analytical underpinnings, a consensus has emerged on the steps to prepare
subsequent operations in the series. This consensus includes an early start o f the policy dialogue, with a
roadinap being drawn up at the end o f the summer to set up the various stages and requirements from the
initial formulation o f the policy matrix to the assessment o f triggers to the policy dialogue on specific
actions to the negotiation o f the credit.



C.        CIVIL SOCIETY


102.      With the support o f the NGO Resource Center, civil society organizations participated actively in
the preparation o f the VDR 2007, which served as the analytical foundation for the proposed series o f
credits.   The VDR 2007 helped "translate" the SEDP 2006-2010 into a set o f prior actions for PRSC 6
and subsequent operations in the series. The NGO contribution focused on infrastructure (especially in
the relation to the needs o f PWD), the social sectors and legal development. Substantive inputs were
provided on the interpretation o f the key development issues in each area, the identification o f the main
strengths and weaknesses o f the government's strategy to address those issues, the prioritization o f policy
actions within the SEDP framework, and the selection o f the most appropriate outcome indicators to
measure progress in each area.

103.      A well-functioning mechanism is in place in Vietnam to conduct consultations with business
associations. Prior to both the year-end CG meeting between government and donors and the informal
mid-year CG meeting, the Vietnam Business Forum (VBF) gathers to discuss the issues o f concern to a
range o f chambers and associations representing the interests o f enterprises. The discussion i s organized
around topics such as investment promotion, transparency, tax, labor and land. In each o f these areas, a
list o f main concerns i s assembled, and the focus is on assessing progress towards solving them. Many o f
those concerns are addressed through policy actions supported by the PRSC process. At the last VBF, in
December 2005, the current cycle o f PRSC operations was discussed, and feedback from the participating
chambers and associations was sought.

                                                        Ha Long City, June 1,2007

                      Thisstatement updates the IMF stafs assessment of Vietnam'scurrent economic situation
                     provided to the Consultative Group (CG) Meeting held inHanoi on December 14-15, 2006.

                      1.      Vietnam's economic performance has remained strong duringthe first few months of
                      2007. Exports have continued to grow briskly, investment and consumption growth have
                      remained strong, and industrial production has continued to expand at double-digitrates.
                      With market sentimentbolstered by Vietnam's much-awaited accession to the WTO on
                      January 11, foreign direct investment(FDI) and portfolio capital inflows have been
                      particularlybuoyant, and the overall balance of payments has recorded a sizable surplus.

                      2.      Growing accessto foreign markets and capitalhas created new opportunitiesfor cost-
                      effective financing of Vietnam's large investment requirements, but has also created new
                      challenges. The Ho Chi Minh City StockMarket Price Index rose by 144.5 percent in 2006,
                      and by another 50 percent in the firsttwo months of 2007, before retreating somewhat in
                      recent months. With the number of listed companies rising fiom 41 at end-2005to nearly
                      200, the market's total capitalization soared fiom less that VND 10trillion (1.2 percent of
                      GDP) at end-2005 to VND 320 trillion (28 '/z percent of GDP) as of mid-May 2007. This
                      unprecedented boom in stock prices has reduced the cost of capital for firms, boosted the
                      wealth and consumption of domestic investors, and increased Vietnam's appeal to foreign
                      investors. At the same time, however, the need to contain the attendantrisks to the financial
                      system has heightened the urgency of policy measures to protect macroeconomic stability,
                      enhance financial system surveillance, and improvethe governance of state-owned
                      commercial banks (SOCBs) and state-owned enterprises(SOE).

                      Short-Term Outlook and Risks

                      3.      The prospects for 2007 remain broadly favorable. GDP is projected to continueto
                      expand at an annual rate of around 8 percent, led by sustained export and investmentgrowth.
                      While a pick-up in imports is projected to shiftthe trade balance back into a deficit, this is
                      likely to be more than financed by continued strong receipts fiom remittancesand capital
                      inflows.

                      4.      However,the outlook is not without risks. Inflation remains stubbornlyhigh, with the
                      twelve-month rate estimated to have risen back above 7 percent since April 2007. Welcome
                      adjustments in electricityand petroleum prices, together with a resurfacing of food supply
                      shocks, have contributedto the recent uptick in prices. However, large increases in the prices
                      of major nonfood items also seem to point to growing demand pressures, which may become
                      more difficult to contain as growing capital inflows complicate monetary management. The

                      risk of rising inflationcould be heightened if a large positive fiscal impulse were to further
                      add to the demand pressures in 2007.

                      5 .      Over the medium term, a slowdown in the global economy or a tightening of global
                      liquidity conditions could expose vulnerabilitiesin the balance sheets of financial institutions
                      and large SOEs, which may have made sub-optimal investment decisions duringthe period
                      of booming demand. The resulting contingent government liabilities,together with continued
                      reliance on the state sector to finance the bulk of the country's huge infrastructureneeds,
                      could eventuallythreaten debt sustainability.

                      Fiscal Policy and Reforms

                      6.       The risk of inflation,and the need to protect medium-term debt sustainability,call for
                      a more cautious fiscal stance.The estimated fiscal deficitrecorded a welcome decrease in
                      2006, but the 2007 Budget appearsto be set on an expansionary course. Current expenditure
                      is to be boosted by a sharp increase in social expendituresin 2007, after having been fueled
                      largely by increasingwages and oil subsidies in 2005-06. While a large oil revenue windfall
                      helped to contain the overall deficit (based on the Fund's definition,which includeson-
                      lending through the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) and off-budget investment)to less
                      than 4 percent of GDP in 2006, full implementationof the investment plans envisaged in the
                      Socio-EconomicDevelopment Program (SEDP) for 2006-2010 could raise the deficitto
                      7 percent of GDP in 2007. The non-oil deficitwould rise from 13%percent of GDP in 2006
                      to 15%percent of GDP in 2007, while the public debt stock would rise from about 44 percent
                      of GDPat end-2006to around 46 percent of GDP by end-2007. While the concessionalterms
                      on most external debt, which still accounts for more than half of total public debt, would help
                      keep the debt service burden manageable, growing recourse to market-based financing
                      through the capital markets could make the fiscal position more vulnerableto changes in
                      market sentiment.

                      7.       Given the projected leveling off of oil receipts,the containmentof the fiscal deficit
                      will require a concerted effort to boost non-oil revenues and curb expendituregrowth. The
                      reduction in import tariff rates associated with WTO accession,and the constraints posed by
                      planned tax reforms, call for an accelerated effortto improvetax administration.On the
                      expenditure side, we welcome the recent progress toward adjustingdomesticoil prices, and
                      support the authorities' decision to remove remaining controlsover oil prices by the end of
                      2008. To curb pressureson the government's wage bill and slow the growth of its pension
                      liabilities, we encouragethe authoritiesto discontinue the indexation of public wages and
                      pensions to the common minimum wage, and adopt instead a more differentiatedand merit-
                      based structureof salary increases in the contextof civil servicereform. Slowingthe growth
                      of public investment is likely to be a challenge, given the urgent need to ease the country's
                      serious infrastructurebottlenecks. To ensurecontinued development of essential public
                      infrastructure,more proactive stepsto encourage private participation could be considered.
                      Projects still funded through the issuance of investmentbonds or on-lendingshould be
                      subject to rigorous screening and monitoring, and the credit appraisaland risk management
                      capacitiesof the Vietnam DevelopmentBank (VDB) strengthened.Effective enforcementof
                      the new lawsto curb corruption and prevent the waste of public fundswould need to be an
                      integralpart of this effort.

                      Monetary Policy and Exchange System Reform

                      8.      A more restrained monetary policy will likely be required to contain inflation,and
                      limit the potential expansion of nonperforming loans (NPLs). Credit growth has showed
                      signs of reacceleration in recent months, with the rate of growth of credit to the economy
                      rising from 23 percent in the year to September2006 to about 29 percent in the year to
                      February 2007. While the authorities' monetary program for 2007 envisagesa slowingof
                      credit growth to 20 percent by year-end, the achievementof this objective is threatened by
                      ample excess bank liquidity.The authorities' recent effortsto introduce prudential restraints
                      on commercialbank lending for stock market purchases are welcome steps, which should
                      help reduce banks' exposureto stock market risks and guard against a potentiallycostly
                      boom-bust cycle in stock prices. The authoritiesalso need to take more pro-active measures
                      to mop up excess liquidity,including by allowing the StateBank of Vietnam (SBV) to
                      exercise adequate autonomy in the issuance of SBV bills.

                      9.      Vietnam's rapid integration into the global economycallsfor continued effortsto
                      increase exchange rate flexibility.The authoritieshave recentlytaken welcome steps in this
                      direction. In January 2007, the trading band of the dong vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar was
                      widened from +I-0.25 percent to +/-0.5 percent aroundthe daily reference rate set by the
                      SBV, and the dong temporarily appreciated as the pace of inflowspeaked in January-
                      February 2007. In the face of continuing large foreign exchange inflows, further steps to
                      increase exchangerate flexibilitywould serveto stem inflationary pressures while decreasing
                      the need for sterilization.A more flexible exchange rate policy could also mitigatethe
                      potential disruptive effects of a possible futurereversal of capital inflows by encouraging
                      economic agentsto better hedge exchange rate risks and allowing the exchangerate to play a
                      greater role as a shock absorber.

                      Bank Reform and Financial Sector Supervision

                      10.     Bank reform remains key to improvingthe allocationof saving and investment and
                      protecting financial stability.The growingpossibilitiesfor financingthrough the capital
                      market, increasing competition fromjoint-stock banks, and the new regime of liberal entry of
                      filly foreign-ownedbanks, have increased the urgency of SOCBreform. In this context, the
                      government's renewed commitmentto proceed with the equitizationof the main SOCBs is
                     welcome, as is the recent increase in the ceiling for participation by individual strategic
                      investors. We also welcome the recent adoption of an SOCB recapitalizationplan, and look
                      forward to the upcoming publication of financial reports of the SOCBs based on International
                      Accounting Standards.These steps need to be backed by timely actionto improve the
                      corporate governanceof SOCBs, including by providing their managers with adequate
                      autonomyto make lending decisionsbased on purely commercial criteria.

                      11.     The growing scope for securitiesmarket operationsand portfolio capital movements
                      also calls for hrther steps to strengthen prudential regulation of bank and nonbank financial
                      institutions. We supportthe authorities' medium-term plans to convert the SBV into a
                      modern central bank, and to grant it adequate authority and independence to carry out an
                      anti-inflationary monetary policy and effectivefinancial sector supervision.In the meantime,
                      it is importantthat the SBV,the State SecuritiesCommission (SSC), and the Ministry of

                      Finance improve the tracking of vulnerabilities associated with stock market-related risks and
                      capital movements. Given the risks posed by related transactions among banks, their
                       securities company affiliates, and the buyers or issuers of securities, a concerted effort is
                      required to regulate stock market-related credit and discourage insider trading. Controls also
                      need to be put in place to prohibit related-partytransactions within economic groups
                       involved in a mix of industrial operations and financial services.

                       State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Private Sector Development

                       12.     The authorities' plans to restructure and equitize SOEs are welcome. However, it will
                      also be important that SOE managers be granted clear incentives and full autonomy to make
                      their own pricing and investment decisions on commercial principles, and the entry of
                       foreign strategic investors should be encouraged to facilitate the needed improvement in SOE
                      governance. The mandates of economic groups of wholly state-owned enterprises, and their
                      relations with government, should be clearly defined, and regulatory safeguards established,
                      where needed, to ensure that their market power will not be used to undermine competition.

                       13.     A more transparent and market-friendly legal and regulatory framework would be key
                      to enabling Vietnam to capitalize on its growing appeal to foreign investors. We welcome
                      plans to align energy prices with world market conditions, and urge the authorities to also
                      remove other remaining price controls that discourage private investment. To further level
                      the playing field, simpliQ rules and regulations, and improve the business climate, we
                      encourage the authorities to swiftly adopt pending legislation and associated implementing
                      decrees and circulars in full conformity with Vietnam's WTO commitments.

                       14.     The quality, timeliness, and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics and Financial
                       Stability Indicators will also need to be improved to support informed policy decisions and
                      build enduring investor confidence. In this regard, we support the authorities' ongoing efforts
                      to develop better measures of core inflation and look forward to the issuance of the
                      government's first semi-annual Debt Bulletin. More transparent accounting, reporting, and
                      monitoring of the government's extra-budgetary operations and all publicly-funded projects
                      would also be helpkl in reassuring donors that their assistance is being put to the best use.

                      Concluding Remarks

                       15.     Vietnam's historic accessionto the WTO attests to its impressive economic progress
                      since the launching of the policy of Doi Moi some twenty years ago. In the coming years,
                      deepening economic and financial integration should facilitate achievement of the
                      government's ambitious objectives to lift Vietnam from the ranks of low-income countries by
                      2010 andjoin the ranks of industrial countries by 2020. However, growing exposureto
                      global markets has made it all the more importantthat macroeconomic policies be kept on a
                       sound footing and the pace of market-oriented reforms accelerated. We have no doubt that,
                      with the continued goodjudgment of its leadership, Vietnam will successfully meet these
                      challenges, and we wish the authorities every success in these endeavors.

Mr. Paul Wolf'owitz
President
The World Bank
Washington, DC


Dear Mr. Wolfowitz:

         Over the last five years the World Bank, and the donor community more broadly,
supported the economic rcnovation program o f Vietnam through a series o f five Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs).
         During this period, our ccononiy grcw at an annual rate o f 7.8 pcrccnt per year in real
terms. exports expanded by roughly 22 percent per year in dollar terms, and the fraction o f the
population living below the international poverty line declined by more than three percentage
points per year. This period has also seen considerable progress in social indicators, with
Victnam now being on a solid track to attain or exceed most if' not all of the Millennium
Develclpment Goals. Over these five years, considerable progress was made in public financial
nianagement, public administration ref'orm and the strengtheningo f governance more broadly.
         These successes retlect the reform drive o f our government, as expressed among others
in thc Comprchcnsive Poverty Rcdiiction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). The CPRGS, which
was supported by the World Bank and many other donors, jointly with other plans and strategic
documents o f our government, served as the basis for a contin~iouspolicy dialogue across a
range of' policy areas.    PRSC operations provided an effective platform to conduct such
dialogue. refine the content and articulation of policy reforms and channel resources to our
budget to finance their implementation. The usefulness o f this approach is confirmed by the
increasingly large number of donors participating in PRSCs.           The commitment o f our
government to the process is reflected in the timely completion o f the annual operations in the
cycle.
         Building on the successes o f economic reforms over the previous five years, Vietnam's
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006-2010 was approved by the National
Assembly on June 29, 2006. In December 2006, the SEDP was presentcd to the Board of
Executive Directors o f the World Bank.
         A key goal or the SEDP is to sustain rapid economic growth so that Vietnam can move
out o f low income status by 2010 and lay the foundations to become an industrial country by
2020. The SEDP aflirms that rapid growth should go hand in hand with improved
sustainability, and improved quality and compctitiveness o f the economy.        Importance is
attached to in-depth development while wider development should not be forgotten. Economic
growth should be linked with poverty reduction, cultural development, comprehensive human
development, exercise of democracy and social equity. The SEDP also aims to narrow the
dcwlopiiient gaps among regions, step by step, while preserving and improving the
environment. We would like to draw your attention to the Chapter IV of'the SEDP which
provides the Development Orientation of various sectors over the period 2006-2010.

        Overall. the objectives, tasks and solutions of the SEDP can be mapped on to three
pillars (a) business development (b) natural resources and the environment and (c) social
cquity.   Chapter 1V highlights thc goals, tasks, and solutions for achieving agricultural
development, industrial modernization, and service sector growth. Chapter VI1 of the SEDP
identifies the roles of various sectors in business development, includingthe role of the private
sector as a driving force. We aim to create favorable conditions for the development of the
private sector without limiting its scales, fields or regions. Chapter 1V.B details the goals,
tasks. and solutions for the social sectors, while Chapter 1V.C identifies goals and policies for
thc sustainable developmentof natural resources and protection ofthe environinent
        In order to achieve the objectives of cconomic growth, business development,
environmental sustainability and social equity we need to improve the institutional framework
of the socialist oriented market economy in a comprehensive manner. The measures to this
effect are especially highlighted in Chapter IX. The chapter emphasizes legal reforms for
supporting a market economy, the importance of improving the q~iality of public
administration, and strengtheningthe fight against corruption.
        The government's resolution No. 3/2007/NQ-CP identifies the tasks of various
ministries and agencies for implementing the SEDP and the state budget during this year. This
resolution affirms our commitment to successfullyachieving the targets identified in the SEDP.
        The tasks listed in this resolution bear a close resemblance with the policy actions and
triggers identified in the proposed credit, Jointly with the following operations in the series,
the proposed series effectively supports the implementation of the reform agenda outlined in
the SEDP. The proposed credit also contributes to harmonization, in the spirit of thc Hanoi
Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness.         Our government appreciates the technical inputs
provided through this process. as well as thc resources to implement policy reforms and the
rcduced transactioncosts in conductingthe policy dialogue with the donor community.
        Our government therefore requests the Association's assistance through this sixth
PRSC, in recognition for the progress made in the implementation of our development strategy.
We recognize that many difficult challenges lie ahead, but we are confident that we will be able
to overcome them. We hope that we will count on the support of the Association during this
five-yex cycle, as we make progress to implement the reform program, with the ambition of
becoming a middle-income country by the end of the decade.
        We look forward to y0111`continuedsupport   43
