F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) discussed by the Board in February 2007 concluded that
the SEDP of the government incorporated the necessary poverty reduction principles, was
broadly sound and was a plan that could both deliver growth and reduce poverty. The CPS
defined the PRSC as one of the modalities to support the implementation of SEDP. The Program
Document for PRSC 6 charts the second cycle of PRSC operations (PRSCs 6-10). The CPS
Progress Report was discussed by the Board in December 2009, and the CPS for 2012-16 is
scheduled to be discussed by the Board concurrently with its consideration of the proposed
operation. The proposed operation is consistent with the new SEDP 2011-15, scheduled for
approval in November 2011 and hence with the new CPS.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Vietnam has recorded impressive economic growth and remarkable poverty
reduction in the past twenty five years. The political and economic reforms (?ổi Mới)
launched in 1986 have transformed Vietnam from one of the poorest countries in the
world, with per capita income below US$ 100 in the 1990s, to the status of a lower
middle-income country with per capita income estimated at US$ 1,374 in 2011.1 This
achievement fulfilled the Government of Vietnam’s (GoV’s) vision articulated in the
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010 and was supported by the second
series of Poverty Reduction Support Credit operations (PRSCs 6-10) from the World
Bank and donor partners.

2.      Economic reforms raised productivity in agriculture, attracted foreign direct
investment and enabled a gradual shift from agriculture to higher productivity, low-cost
manufacturing sector. Investments in physical capital and human resources led to
increased capital and labor productivity. ASEAN and WTO membership in 1995 and
2007 respectively, and a series of bilateral trade agreements, promoted further reforms,
leading to higher private and public investments. These factors helped raise efficiency in
the enterprise sector, boost agriculture production, increase foreign trade and investment,
improve public service delivery, and most importantly reduce the poverty rate
dramatically in the country.

3.      Based on a ‘basic needs’ poverty line initially accepted in 1998 2, the poverty
headcount fell from 58 percent in the early 1990s, to 14.5 percent by 2008, and by these
standards it is estimated to be well under 10 percent by 2010. 3 The country has attained
five of its ten original millennium development goal (MDGs) targets and is likely to
attain two more by 2015.

4.     With the above achievements, Vietnam has established a successful track record
during the first PRSC series–PRSCs 1-5 implemented between 2001 and 2006–while
embarking on a comprehensive reform agenda. This agenda was built on the
government’s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) which
focused on four priorities of development, namely, fostering of business development,
keeping growth inclusive, ensuring environmental sustainability, and improving
governance.

  The General Statistics Office-WB poverty line was presented in the 2000 Country Economic
Memorandum Attacking Poverty (World Bank, 2000) and is approximately $1.10 (2005 PPP). It was
constructed on the basis of the consumption behavior of the poor in the 1993 VLSS, and has been updated
for inflation for each round of the VHLSS.
3
  In September 2010, Vietnam announced a new official poverty rate of 14.2 percent. In June 2012, the
World Bank and General Statistics Office, using 2012 VHLSS data, have proposed a new and higher
poverty line for Vietnam that is consistent with its status as a lower-middle income country.


                                                  1
5.      The second PRSC series supported by the Bank and donor partners–PRSCs 6-10
implemented between 2007 and 2012–was based on the SEDP 2006-2010 which
represented a significant departure from previous five-year development plans (Box 1).
The Vietnam Development Report 2007: Aiming High 4 , co-signed by 16 donors,
provided the main analytical underpinnings for the new PRSC series. The VDR 2007
argued convincingly that the comprehensive approach was indeed the strength of the
Vietnamese reform process as it maintained the cross-sectoral nature of development,
reflecting appropriately the development stage of the country. Following this reasoning,
the framework of priorities for donor assistance was maintained in the PRSC cycle to
build on similar integration of perspectives and to preserve this main strength of
Vietnam’s reform process. This approach also helped the donors to avoid the “either-or?
approach to the key development priorities of the country.

6.       Optimism was high at the
start of PRSCs 6-10. Donors saw            Box 1: Overview of the SEDP 2006-2010
SEDP 2006-2010 as a credible and The GoV has an established practice of preparing 10 year

7.      While the initial period in which the second PRSC series was implemented was
characterized by rapid growth and stable macroeconomic conditions, the country
subsequently faced an increasingly volatile, and at times fragile, macroeconomic
environment—starting with the global financial crisis in 2008 (Chart 1 and Table 1).
While Vietnam weathered the negative impacts of the global financial crisis relatively
well through a strong fiscal and monetary stimulus package in 2008-2009, its economy
struggled with overheating, lower growth and a less stable macroeconomic environment
than in the pre-crisis period.

8.      The global economic shocks were exacerbated by domestic policy missteps. The
economic recovery soon turned to overheating, in large part due to the delayed
withdrawal of the stimulus package, a reflection of the ‘growth at any cost’ policy
pursued by the government to ensure jobs and social stability. Consequently, by the end
of 2010 the economy was faced with high and rising inflation, extreme volatility in the
foreign exchange market, rapidly dwindling international reserves, a sharp rise in country
risk following default by one of its biggest SOEs, high levels of fiscal and trade deficits,
and weaknesses in the banking and corporate sectors. Following Resolution 11, the
government focus turned to tightening fiscal and monetary policy, which have helped to
restore macroeconomic balance but also led to a slowdown in growth in 2012 and the
negative consequences of fast economic expansion, especially among the SOEs and their
effect on the banking and financial sector. Despite the progress, risks to macroeconomic
management remain high, emanating primarily from structural weaknesses the banking
sector and SOEs. Delayed and poor implementation of structural reforms including the
resolution of bad debts in the banks and SOEs could unravel gains already made.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

9.      The objectives of the PRSCs 6-10 series were based on the four pillars of
development objectives established in the SEDP 2006-2010: (i) Pillar 1 Business
Development - promotion of growth and transition to a market economy; (ii) Pillar 2
Social Inclusion - poverty reduction and social inclusion; (iii) Pillar 3 Natural Resources -
sustainable management of the environment and natural resources; and (iv) Pillar 4
Modern Governance - building institutions that can support the strategy. Each of the five
PRSCs was designed around these four pillars as part of the overall program with a set of
specific policy actions for each operation. Flexibility of the policy matrix to adjust
during design of each successive operation was expected to take into account of and/or to
adjust to the development dynamics. This would help to ensure appropriate policy
actions when new issues arose, new studies became available, or the original plan became
no longer applicable. Within these four pillars, each operation was expected to cover a
dozen or so prior actions designed to enable, to enhance or to move forward the reforms
in the relevant areas and to bring the country further toward its goal of reaching the status
of a middle income country – as established in the SEDP 2006-10.

10.     The overall Program Development Objective (PDOs) of the second PRSC series
aimed to help Vietnam develop economic policies and institutions needed to attain the
status of a middle income country, laying out the necessary regulatory framework and
required monitoring mechanisms to shepherd and guide a more complex and
sophisticated economy which consisted of a broader number of stakeholders and players.
The specific objectives toward the overall goal above could be summarized as follows:

   PDO 1: Promotion of growth and transition to a market economy that will foster the
   development of businesses in a business environment crucial to the sustained growth
   of the country’s economy;

   PDO 2: Poverty reduction and social inclusion, enabling all players and stakeholders
   to participate and to enjoy the benefits of development and growth;

   PDO 3: Sustainable management of the environment and natural resources as the
   country seeks to harness the benefits of natural resources and the environment for
   development and growth while ensuring their sustainability;

   PDO 4: Building institutions that can support the country’s development strategy
   through improving governance.

11.     The second PRSC series was also expected to continue very important process
dimensions of the overall government-partner relationship that were established under the
first PRSC series. These process functions relate to the fundamental motivation of the
PRSC series as the dominant aid modality for the country, and are considered for the
purposes of this ICR as important program development objectives to be evaluated. Two
main process functions are considered. First, the second PRSC series was expected to
continue the role of the series in providing the main platform for high-level policy


                                             5
dialogue between government and partners, and in this way provide a signaling
mechanism that the overall policy directions and progress of the government were on
track. Second, the second PRSC series was expected to continue the role of the series in
providing the main platform for donor harmonization. Key related goals were to
coordinate external partner efforts, and provide predictability and reduced transactions
costs to the government.

12.     The monitoring indicators selected at the design stage of the program were
articulated in the program document of the initial operation (see Annex 3 of the PRSC 6
program document). The indicators were selected based on a review of the monitoring
framework in the SEDP 2006-2010, but fewer in number. Three indicators for each of
the 17 policy areas were selected, for a total of 51 indicators. In some areas, the set of
indicators differed from the SEDP monitoring framework to address perceived
weaknesses, for example to have more quantitative and verifiable indicators than the
largely qualitative indicators in the SEDP 2006-2010. An effort was also made to limit
the reliance on administrative self-reporting and leverage the expected implementation of
enterprise and household surveys (e.g., the addition of a governance module in the
Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS)). Given this reliance on expected
new data collection, a number of indicators did not have established benchmarks and/or
targets. This was the case for about one in seven indicators, with a significantly higher
proportion for the Natural Resource pillar. The monitoring of progress toward
development outcomes was not expected to be conducted on an annual basis, due to
expected longer frequency of collecting reliable information from surveys and other
sources with demanding implementation requirements.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

13.     There were no revisions to the PDOs in the five operations of the second PRSC
series. A detailed policy matrix for the series was developed and noted in the program
document for PRSC 6, using SEDP 2006-2010 and other strategic documents as well as
analytical work as the basis for selection. This initial policy matrix included prior actions
for PRSC 6, suggested triggers for PRSC 7 and indicative actions for the remaining
operations as a whole. Throughout this series of operations, some of the policy actions
were adjusted or replaced as new issues arose, new studies became available, the original
plan no longer applied or the intended reform did not materialize.

14.     The monitoring matrix for the program defined at the beginning of the series in
the PRSC 6 program document was revised in the PRSC 10 program document. It is fair
to say that revisions to the monitoring framework were fully expected at appraisal, as
many of the indicators were in areas where the experience with monitoring was limited
(e.g., governance) and/or there was an expected move away from administrative self-
reporting to information from enterprise and household surveys. The formal revision to
the monitoring indicators drew on the findings of the mid-term review, which could not
assess 12 out of 51 original indicators due to either conceptual or data issues. With




                                              6
guidance from the Regional Operations Committee Decision Meeting for PRSC 10 to
modify or drop indicators to better reflect policy actions supported by the series,5 the
monitoring matrix for PRSC 10 decreased the number of indicators per policy area from
three to two, for a new total of 34 indicators. These revisions were then approved by the
Board and comprise the basis for assessing program outcomes in Section 3 of this ICR.
The attention to focusing the monitoring framework at the end of the series also signaled
to the authorities the need for continuous attention to program monitoring, with
adjustments to better sources and specific indicators as needed.

15.     There were a total of 17 policy areas supported by the program, cutting across
four pillars and designed to mirror the main areas of the SEDP 2006-2010 (Table 2). The
majority of policy areas were found in the Business Development and Modern
Governance pillars.

                               Table 2: Policy Areas Covered in PRSCs 6-10




1.5 Revised Policy Areas

16.     There were no revisions or modifications to the policy areas during the PRSC 6-
10 series.

1.6 Other significant changes

17.    There were no other significant changes in the design, scope and scale,
implementation arrangements and schedule. There was supplemental IDA financing to
PRSC 8 in June 2009, in light of the global financial crisis. The US$ 200 million in
supplemental financing was provided on request from the government and raised the total
IDA contribution for PRSC 8 to US$ 350 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

18.      Vietnam has been a very strong performer in Asia, with one of the best records of
rapid growth and poverty reduction in the region. Looking back at the last ten years covering
the full PRSC series 1 - 10, the growth record has been remarkable, averaging above 7
percent from 2001 to 2011. In line with this good track record, Vietnam‘s economic growth
in the years covered by this PRSC series was 8.5 percent in 2007, 6.3 percent in 2008, 5.3
percent in 2009 (in spite of the global financial crisis), 6.8 percent in 2010 and an estimated
5.9 percent in 2011. Vietnam‘s rapid economic growth has been accompanied by significant
strides in reducing poverty, falling from 58 percent in the early 1990s to less than 15 percent
in 2010.

19.     The second PRSC series served as a well-established vehicle to provide
coordinated financial and technical assistance from the World Bank and development
partners. The key factors affecting the implementation and outcomes of the PRSC series
reflected the country framework and environment specific to Vietnam at this stage of its
development as they mirrored closely the progress in the implementation of the set of
reforms carried out under the framework of the SEDP 2006-10.

20.     Nonetheless, the rapid pace of economic changes has created significant policy
and institutional challenges for Vietnam. This is partly due to the country’s steady
integration into the global economy, including with WTO accession in 2007, which
brought higher flows of foreign direct and portfolio investments and helped to boost
international trade. This has exposed Vietnam to increased commodity price volatility
and financial turbulence in the global economy as well as the effects of slower growth in
North America and Europe. With its market-based institutions still not uniformly
developed, the country has found it increasingly difficult to cope with this new economic
environment. Additionally, implementation of PRSC reforms highlighted new challenges
that had to be addressed in existing areas.

21.     The unfavorable external environment of recent years—global financial crisis in
2008/09 and weak and hesitant global economic recovery since then—has been a major
factor affecting implementation and outcomes of PRSC 6-10 operations. Vietnam has
always been highly vulnerable to global economic shocks given its high trade ratio (200
percent of GDP), a big recipient of FDI (8-10 percent of GDP) and one of the biggest
recipients of remittances. Therefore, the global economic crisis led to considerable
changes in programs and priorities for the government and a major interruption of its
rapid growth and poverty reduction process.

22.     The unfavorable global environment was made more challenging by the high
growth policy adopted by the country’s leadership at the beginning of the second PRSC
series. The emphasis on high growth was pursued sometimes at the cost of implementing
medium-term structural reforms that could have served to build stronger foundations for
sustained growth, as reflected in some delays in prior actions supporting reforms in SOEs
and banking sector. At the same time, Vietnam is still a transition economy with weak
and underdeveloped market institutions. Therefore, since the beginning of the global


                                              8
crisis in 2008, Vietnam’s policymakers, with their limited capacity and understanding of
a market economy, had to reorient their focus and emphasis away from a high growth
strategy and play catch up to a rapidly changing and highly uncertain global environment
and to timely stabilize its macro economy. Further, while the consensus-building
approach in the government helped to strengthen ownership, it was found wanting while
addressing urgent challenges facing the economy. This has meant a disproportionately
large part of their time and energy has gone towards building consensus and at the same
time fire-fighting the economy with temporary and ad-hoc measures, creating
unnecessary delays.

23.     The rest of this section discusses (i) prior actions, triggers and their
implementation; (ii) major factors affecting implementation; (iii) monitoring and
evaluation, implementation and utilization; and (iv) the expected next phase.

2.1 Program Performance

24.     The policy matrix for every PRSC operation contains two types of policy actions.
The first type is “triggers?, which are deemed to be more strategic, because of their
potential impact on development outcomes over time. Triggers are indicated during the
preparation of the previous PRSC operation, and when completed are included as “prior
actions? in the subsequent PRSC legal agreement. The triggers are not rigid conditions
but represent a collective understanding of measures addressing immediate concerns (for
example, enhancing public disclosure and communication of SBV policies and banking
sector statistics), and medium-term structural reforms to be initiated now as a priority (for
example, formulating a roadmap to improve corporate and government bond markets to
foster financial and economic growth). In addition to the triggers, the policy matrix also
contains other reforms undertaken by the government. This broader set of actions, or
“benchmarks,? does not represent the use of conditionality, but reflects the breadth and
scope of the reforms being undertaken by the government of Vietnam, and is a way to
engage in the substances of the reforms. By providing a more comprehensive picture of
developments in each policy area, this matrix allows a better understanding of the
progress being made in the reform program.

25.     All operations except PRSC 10 were implemented on schedule, with preparation
linking closely with donor reform efforts, and more importantly aligned with the
government‘s budget preparation cycle 6. In all years, most triggers were fully met and
completed as prior actions in time for Board approval, though there were instances when
triggers were replaced or adjusted to reflect the progress on the ground. A minority was
partially met, and one or two per operation were not met. Table 2 provides a summary of
trigger performance over the second PRSC series, and Annex 7 provides details within
each operation. Fully meeting all triggers would signify that the reform agenda was not
as ambitious as it could be. Thus, as noted earlier, flexibility was built into the triggers so


6
 PRSC 10 was delayed by six months to give more time to the government to complete some of the key
policy actions, especially the ones involving SOEs.



                                                 9
that during the PRSC cycle there were some substitutions and modifications to reflect the
current situation facing the government and the relevant ministries and agencies. On
balance, the performance reflected in Table 3 reflects an appropriate amount of pushing
the agenda through demanding triggers, while also balancing the need for tangible
milestones of progress along the way. The following paragraphs present the prior actions
for each of the five operations and discuss the relation to triggers identified for the
operation in the previous PRSC program document.

program triggers.

26.     PRSC 6 was the first operation in the series, prepared and implemented in 2007,
and included 12 prior actions in 11 areas. These prior actions were agreed during the
conclusion of PRSC 5 (in the previous series). During the time since PRSC 5 closed, the
GoV made progress across all policy areas (Table 4). Under Pillar 1, following WTO
accession, the global integration was supported by the granting of trading and distribution
rights to all foreign firms, in line with international commitments, and the issuance of
regulations to guide the intellectual property law, with adequate enforcement
mechanisms.       SOE reform included more divestiture and better monitoring of
performance. The list of sectors where 100-percent state ownership was to be retained
was further restricted from 29 to 19, and covered mainly activities deemed to be strategic.
The implementation of the ambitious banking reform strategy adopted under the previous
operation focused on strengthening the commercial orientation of state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs) which dominated the market. Prior actions under this
operation aimed for the equitization of two SOCBs, including one of the largest ones,
over the following year. There were also benchmarks included in the policy matrix
regarding private sector development and the removal of administrative barriers to entry.
In infrastructure, mechanisms were supported to increase the efficiency of public
resources and increase the volume of private funding.

27.      PRSC 7 was prepared and implemented in 2008, and included 13 completed prior
actions (Table 5). Important gains were made since PRSC 6, for example, as reflected in
fully met triggers in PFM, infrastructure, education, land-use, auditing and asset
declaration. Of the original 14 triggers, eight were fully met, five were partially met and
one not met (Annex 7). This reflected a downturn in policy performance, though still a
relatively very good performer in comparison to other PRSC programs of the Bank. 7
There was general agreement among partners at the time that most of the slippages
reflected “circumstantial or institutional? obstacles to implementation, and did not reflect
a weaker commitment of the government to reform. For example, the decline in asset
prices and stock market slump in 2008 made the government reluctant to sell a strategic
share of the capital of SOCBs to private investors at perceived low values. This was also
at a time when the government was implementing heightened fiscal measures. On the
institutional side, an unclear allocation of responsibilities between ministries prevented
any substantial progress on the sanitation strategy, whereas the more assertive stance of
the National Assembly resulted in delays to approve the health insurance law. An


7
  IEG (2009) assessed the Vietnam PRSC series as the third best performer out of 27 PRSC countries
reviewed worldwide, with the lowest number and percentage of triggers relaxed.

extensive consultation process on the guidelines for the Gender Equality and the decree
on river basin management also led to the postponement of their issuance.

28.    PRSC 8 was prepared and implemented over 2009, a difficult year of recovering
from domestic economy problems and trying to navigate the unfolding global crisis.
PRSC 8 was processed by the Bank’s Board under the IDA Financial Crisis Response
Fast-Track Facility, with an increase of US$ 200 million in IDA support in order to help
meet the financing necessary to implement the government’s fiscal stimulus package.
This additional IDA support in part substituted for the inability to issue a planned second
sovereign bond, which was not possible given changes in the global context.

29.     The policy matrix was reduced compared to the previous two operations in the
series, with eight prior actions compared to 12 and 13 in PRSCs 6 and 7, respectively
(Table 6). This reflected in part a focusing on technical areas related to the emerging
economic challenges. Of the original set of 11 triggers proposed in the preceding
operation, seven were fully met and two were partially met (Annex 7). For the two not
met (standards for certification of health workers and facilities, and revisions to the Press
Law), the government indicated that further consultations were required among the
concerned agencies and thus it could not meet the time schedule for PRSC 8. These were


                                                  12
to be considered for the following operation. Of the two partially-met triggers, the first
on improvements to social security fund investments was considered close to being met,
as the plan was in the final stage, and was submitted to the Governing Board of the
Vietnam Social Security (VSS) for comments, the last step before submitting it for
official approval by the Prime Minister. Therefore, this trigger was rephrased in the list of
prior actions. The second regarding a nationwide assessment of forest resources had
elements towards meeting the trigger, but was deemed further away in substance from
being met.

30.    With limitations noted above, there were considerable achievements in the
majority of areas. In relation to the environment trigger, there has been progress beyond
the adoption of the National Targeted Program (NTP) for Climate Change and
assignment of institutional responsibilities which was important given the required inter-
ministerial coordination. Importantly, this work also helped lead to sustained efforts
outside the PRSC framework, specifically the multi-donor Support Program to Respond
to Climate Change. Also, work behind the trigger on state sector reform helped the
government revise the relevant regulations on the financial management of SOEs the
venturing of Economic Groups and General Corporations (large groups of SOEs). This
was an important step given their investment in banks and other financial institutions
fueled the asset bubbles of 2007-2008 and contributed to macroeconomic instability.
Another important milestone supported by PRSC 8 was the 2009 Public Debt Law, which
has been confirmed recently as establishing the required sound legal framework for debt
management in Vietnam. This law created a dedicated debt department in MOF,
consolidated the management of domestic and external debt, and strengthened the
information sharing among relevant ministries.

                              Table 6: PRSC 8 Prior Actions
 Pillar I: Business Development
 State Sector Reform    Strengthen financial management of SOEs and their investments in other
                         entities, defining the level of such investments
 Financial Sector       Prepare revised law of State Bank of Vietnam focusing its mandate on and

31.     PRSC 9 was prepared and implemented in 2010, a year marked with pre-
occupation on preparation of the next development plan period. Most importantly, the
leadership was occupied with the upcoming Party Congress which was the most critical
political event in the country. Also in 2010, the country formally achieved middle
income status, based on World Bank assessment of 2009 gross national income. This
was an important milestone but also had implications on the volume, terms and structure
of aid from development partners. Some partners limited or stopped their financial
support to the PRSC series (Chart 2), though most continued to participate in the policy
discussions which continued to be very useful for their (altered) programs. In addition,
there was continued attention on macroeconomic management to mitigate the aftershocks
of the global financial crisis. It was also the last year of the current Socio-Economic
Development Strategy 2001-2010 and the SEDP 2006-2010, and when strategic thinking
about the future took place along with the preparation for the new 10 year strategy and
five year plan. Last, there was initial discussion of successor support after the PRSC 6-
10 series was complete, including possible continuation of programmatic policy lending
though focused on macroeconomic issues and a few cross-cutting themes, accompanied
by more sectoral development policy operations, which would drill down to second
generation reforms. An increase in sectoral policy operations was noted in the areas of
public investment, power, and climate change.

32.     The operation had nine completed prior actions in the four pillars, against 11
triggers proposed in the preceding operation (Table and Annex 7). Out of the 11 triggers,
six were achieved fully or exceeded at the time of Board approval in June 2010. These
six included the regulations on commercial banks, national targeted program for rural
water supply and sanitation, conservation of water, internal audit decree, civil service
management, and procurement. Three triggers―education, state sector reform, and
health―were assessed as partially achieved.

33.    Areas where triggers were only partially met or not met illustrate the trade-offs in
defining challenging policy actions and staying within the tight annual schedule of the
PRSC operations. More generally, some of the reforms not fully achieved were followed
up in subsequent operations. The education trigger in PRSC 9 was delayed, but cost
estimates for full-day schooling were produced and consultations with stakeholders


                                            14
started. The prior action was revised accordingly. However, the consultations were
completed after Board approval, representing full achievement of the original trigger but
just outside the tight timeframe of the annual operation cycle. Also, the establishment of
gender equality indicators could not be completed in time. The Ministry of Labor, War
Invalids and Social Affairs and the General Statistics Office needed more time to work
out the list of meaningful indicators for monitoring purpose, and the trigger was
completed fully in the following months and included as a prior action in PRSC 10.
Similarly, the social protection trigger in PRSC 8 to approve a strategic plan to ensure
prudential and effective investment of social security funds was not included as a prior
action, however efforts continued and the strategic plan was submitted to the Prime
Minister in July 2010.

34.     PRSC 10, prepared and implemented in 2011-2012, concluded the cycle of
operations supporting the set of reforms under the framework of the SEDP 2006-2010.
Against the backdrop of protracted global sluggishness and continued domestic structural
challenges, the consensus among policymakers after the completion of the eleventh Party
Congress in January 2011 was to focus on measures to restore macroeconomic stability,
even if it was at the expense of slower growth in the short term. The delayed withdrawal
of the 2009-10 stimulus package, which was introduced in response to the 2008-09 global
economic crisis, led to overheating in the economy. By the end of 2010, inflation was
over 10 percent, the dong had depreciated rapidly against the US dollar, reserves fell to
below two months of imports, and the fiscal deficit was 6.4 percent of GDP. In response,


                                                  15
the Government introduced measures in February 2011 to tighten monetary and fiscal
policy, and implement structural reforms intended to curb inflation, stabilize the economy
and ensure social safety (Resolution 11). With the PRSC series drawing to an end, the
Bank has initiated, at the Government's request, discussions on a follow up operation: an
Economic Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCC). Like the PRSCs, the
EMCC is expected to be a multi-year, multi-donor operation starting in FY12 and ending
in FY16. The operation proposes to focus on critical reforms to enhance competitiveness,
which is central to sustained growth and poverty reduction in Vietnam.

35.      The operation had 11 prior actions that were completed before Board approval,
against a proposed set of 11 triggers proposed in the PRSC 9 program document (Table 8
and Annex 7). Six of the 11 triggers were fully met or exceeded; three were partially met
with modifications to the prior actions and two were not met. Full achievements were
found in the prior actions on public disclosure of SBV policies and banking statistics, the
roadmap for corporate and government bond markets, the Gas Master Plan, gender
statistics, technical guidelines for strategic environmental assessments, and a monitoring
framework for corruption. The public administration reform (PAR) trigger agreed during
PRSC 9 expected adoption of the PAR Master Program and an accompanying M&E
system. While the Master Program was adopted in October 2011, the M&E system was
only starting to be piloted by Board approval, and the prior action was modified
accordingly. Two other actions were partially modified from the original triggers to meet
the PRSC 10 time frame. These were for education and health due to the time needed for
the two ministries to complete consultations and institutional preparation requirements.
The SOE trigger agreed during PRSC 9 met significant delays. The original trigger
called for the development of a time-bound plan to separate the exercising of ownership
right from regulatory functions in Economic Groups and large General Corporations.
This was not completed, and instead the current prior action was substituted in the State
Sector Reform policy area. The original PFM trigger expected enhanced management of
transportation assets, as strategically important inputs to development, including budget
allocation, investment, management and maintenance. MOF found the drafting of the
regulation was taking longer than expected, and the SOE-focused prior action was
substituted, which was especially timely given the recent default of a large SOE.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

36.     PRSCs 6-10 supported a long and complex reform agenda, undertaken in a
particularly turbulent period in Vietnam’s development. A number of factors affected the
overall implementation of the program (i.e., the achievement of the individual policy
actions under the five operations). Positive factors included government ownership of
the initial reform agenda, strong donor commitment including the World Bank’s
performance as lead partner agency, and the quality of the analytical foundations.
Changes to the macroeconomic environment including both domestic and external
factors, on the other hand, had a negative effect on program performance. Factors with
positive effects but also some drawbacks include the detailed mechanism for policy
dialogue and the achievement of middle income status, as described below.

     Ownership of the reform agenda by the government. The PRSC series sought to
    continue and to maintain the reform momentum supported under the previous PRSC
    series and to support the government’s own reform outlined in the SEDP for 2006-
    2010. The program was owned by the government with a clear track record from the
    first series, and enjoyed wide support from national stakeholders and relevant
    ministries and agencies. But there were signs that despite strong ownership,
    completing all prior actions became difficult during the latter part of the series. This
    was especially true in difficult policy areas such as state enterprise reforms. Given
    differing interests, consensus-policy making process has often been a reason for
    delays affecting the implementation of policies supported by the PRSCs. For
    example, PRSC 10 was delayed by six months as a number of policy actions had not
    been met. Even after the delay, a number of policy actions, especially those
    involving SOE reforms, had to be replaced and the World Bank had to make several
    requests to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Chairman of the PRSC Steering
    Committee, to intervene and facilitate the completion of the prior actions. Therefore,
    while at the start of the series the Bank and partners generally did not interpret unmet



                                                   17
triggers as waning government backing of the reform agenda, they were less certain
about government’s commitment by the end of the series.

 Strong support by the donor community. The PRSC series benefitted from strong
support from the development partners, under the nominal leadership of the World
Bank. The program was successfully supported by 14 donors and total financial
flows through budget support over five years were nearly US$ 3 billion. The series
also served as an effective vehicle in aid coordination efforts and as an aid
harmonization platform, using country systems, reducing transactions costs and
providing a high degree of predictability of aid flows to the client. The PRSC exercise
also served as a common forum for donors to raise issues of concerns with the
government and provided a wide access for the donors to a large number of ministries
and agencies. Many development partners provided additional funding for budget
support while making available technical assistance to the government to support the
policy dialogue in highly technical and complex areas to strengthen institutional
capacity of the ministries or agencies concerned. World Bank performance was also
commended by nearly all government and donor groups interviewed for this ICR (see
Annexes 4 and 5). But at the same time, given different donors’ priorities, the scope
of policy reforms supported by PRSCs became extensive and the program focus
weakened.

 Quality of the analytical underpinnings. As detailed in each program document,
there was significant attention to providing a rich background of analytical work with
which to engage the client and guide the policy dialogue. The quality and frequency
of the analytical work was highly appreciated by the GoV. The annual Vietnam
Development Report series was a high profile driver of analytical support for the
PRSC series, starting with the VDR 2007 Aiming High which “translated? the SEDP
2006-2010 into a comprehensive program of reform for donor support. In addition to
the VDRs, sector-specific and cross-cutting work underpinned policy dialogue in
those areas. Also important were efforts to provide analytical underpinnings to GoV
in less formal ways, including through using resource persons with close connections
to policy makers that could work behind the scenes and without the appearance of
being donor-driven.

 Changes in the domestic and global macroeconomic environment. These factors
were largely unanticipated, as the country’s track record caused optimism during the
formulation of the second series (see Section 1.1 Context at Appraisal). The
emergence of macroeconomic concerns―including domestic policies that led to the
overheating and asset bubble in 2007-2008 and effects on the banking sector from the
global crisis in 2009-2010―displaced attention away from the deeper structural
reform agenda that was at the core of the SEDP 2006-2010, and hence second PRSC
series, agenda. The changed macroeconomic environment caused priorities in the
PRSC program to shift toward flagging growth, keeping the economy going and
addressing underlying risks that were revealed from the macroeconomic turbulence.
And importantly as noted, it also caused the exceptional top-up of PRSC 8 under the
IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility.


                                        18
     Mechanisms for policy dialogue and the pace of reform. The mechanism for
    government-partner dialogue and adjusting the policy matrix under each operation8
    played a crucial role in the implementation and outcome of the program. There was
    nearly unanimous recognition that the intensive schedule of discussions elevated the
    policy dialogue to a high level and overall led to a faster pace of reform on many of
    the policy actions. Examples included the Decree 49 that helped make education
    more affordable, the Procurement Law and other elements of the legal framework.
    The robust process elements that elevated the policy dialogue also helped crowd in
    donor support, for example the EU starting providing budget support for the first time
    under the PRSC framework. However, the annual frequency of identifying and
    agreeing to triggers and benchmarks was also sometimes a mismatch with sufficient
    time for government to complete actions before Board approval. This was by far the
    largest cause of triggers not being fully met.

     Graduation to middle-income status. Vietnam’s graduation to middle-income
    status was an impressive achievement. It reflected a critical mass of successful
    reforms and the transition toward a market economy. This was an important
    milestone but also had a direct implication on the volume, terms and structure of aid
    from development partners. Some partners limited or stopped their financial support
    to the PRSC series, though most continued to participate in the policy discussions
    which continued to be very useful for their (altered) programs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

37.     Monitoring. The second PRSC series followed the well-accepted and proven
tradition on PRSC implementation with the National Steering Committee (NSC)
established by the government and chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister. The
membership of the NSC included representative from key economic ministries and
agencies, including MOF, MOT, SBV, MOLISA, Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Office
of Government (OOG), the Party’s Economic Commission (PEC) and others. The
participation of OOG and PEC facilitated the coordination of policy decisions while
eliciting needed support for the most critical reforms. SBV was the main counterpart for
the World Bank in the preparation and implementation of PRSCs. A Deputy Governor of
the SBV served as the Standing Vice Chairman of the NSC. In addition, over 20 lines
ministries and government agencies took part throughout the preparation of the five
operations.




8
  The triggers selected during the previous operation were discussed at technical meetings coordinated by
the PRSC Coordination Unit under the SBV. They then served as the annual “plan of action? for the
relevant ministries and agencies that are responsible for implementation. The World Bank PRSC team and
donor representatives followed and monitored these actions during timely missions and technical meetings.
They discussed the specifics of each action, reviewed and commented on draft policy documents, and
agreed to a schedule for their completion.



                                                   19
38.     Coordination. The management of this comprehensive reform program rested
with the Program Coordination Unit (PCU) at the SBV. The PCU facilitated the policy
dialogue between the World Bank and donors with ministries and government agencies
involved in the PRSC. The PCU managed all aspects of coordination among all parties
involved, taking on a variety of tasks and activities in support of the implementation of
the operations –from monitoring to following up with line ministries and agencies on
policy actions documentation to making arrangements for meetings and agendas for
preparation and supervision missions from the donors. On the donor side, the Bank team
spearheaded the implementation supervision of each of the five operations on an annual
basis. The Bank team prepared a comprehensive monitoring report, including a collection
of “one-pagers?9 that laid out main issues and documented progress of each of the prior
actions. This document served as a living record for the government, the Bank, and the
development partners to follow the road map of the PRSCs in action through proposal,
design, modification, revision, and finally to the completion of these actions. The “one-
pagers? also were used to exchange comments on and share experience related to the
content/substance of the policies/regulation under discussions.

39.     Monitoring Indicators. The implementation of the reform agenda in this PRSC
series was monitored through a set of development indicators established at the
preparation of PRSC 6 in 2007. These indicators were selected according to the
framework of the SEDP 2006-2010, but fewer in number. The set of indicators was
modified to reflect the changes made to the policy matrix (also designed during the PRSC
6 preparation) based on opportunities and changes in priorities resulting from the
evolvement of these reforms during the PRSC series. (See the related detailed discussion
in paras. 12 and 14 above).
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

40.    The PRSC series is being followed with a proposed series of three development
policy operations to be implemented between 2013 and 2015―the Economic
Management and Competitiveness Credits―which will focus on three areas critical to
Vietnam’s competitiveness: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) transparency, efficiency, and
accountability of the public sector; and (iii) enabling business environment. The
Decision Meeting was held in November 2012 and Board approval is expected in March
2013.

41.     The new series will take account of lessons in this ICR drawn from the second
PRSC series. Particular aspects discussed during the on-going preparation phase of this
series includes: the need for a more focused approach (therefore the emphasis on
“competitiveness?); greater attention on macroeconomic stability given Vietnam’s recent
experience and importance of macroeconomic stability from the competitiveness


9
  The “one pagers? were a set of annual briefs covering each of the policy actions considered for the upcoming
operation, often covering 50-60 triggers and benchmarks. These briefs served as a living record of the progress in
particular policy actions supported by the PRSC operations from beginning to completion.




                                                          20
perspective); cross-sectoral reform to ensure policy coordination, for example between
SOE, banking and public investment reforms; continued emphasis on harmonization even
if across a smaller number of government ministries/agencies and development partners;
emphasis on strong analytical underpinnings of the program; and stressing the need to
promote an effective monitoring and evaluation framework.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.     The Program Development Objectives of the PRSC 6-10 series were highly
relevant to the government’s reform agenda throughout the implementation period. The
objectives were closely matched to those of the SEDP 2006-2010, the primary planning
framework of the government over the entire course of the PRSC series. Over time,
Pillars 1 and 4 relating to growth and governance became more relevant and accordingly
emphasized more by partners in the evolving policy matrix during the implementation of
the program.

43.     The PRSC series was the cornerstone of the Bank’s 2007 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which was explicitly organized around the SEDP’s four pillars. The CPS
signaled the Bank’s alignment with the SEDP as a credible reform framework that
incorporated the necessary poverty reduction principles and was broadly sound. The CPS
supported the main objectives of the five-year plan through a mix of budget support,
sector investment, technical assistance and analytical instruments. Budget support was
clearly identified as the preferred aid modality given the government’s commitment, as it
allows for a fuller integration of donor support into government systems and alignment
with SEDP implementation.

44.     Design of the PRSC series followed good practice principles in policy-based
lending. The operations reinforced government ownership by supporting rather than
duplicating government processes (aid harmonization among donors, alignment of aid
with the budget cycle, use of government procurement processes, etc.). There was an
accountability framework embedded in the detailed process structure that guided both
government and donors, including arrangements for technical exchange and the use of
continuously updated policy matrices. Prior Actions were distributed evenly across the
four pillars and relevant to the achievement of agreed results, especially with the
adjustment to the monitoring framework in PRSC 10. The design also built on strong
analytical underpinnings to inform the policy dialogue. Given the breadth of the reform
platform, this was a critical part of the PRSC series design.

45.     Implementation required close monitoring on an annual basis and fostered
continued relevance to the government’s reform progress, even if reform momentum
waned at the end of the series. Progress reviews in each operation were transparent and
conducive to performance-based, predictable budget support. Significant and relevant
analytical work was carried out during implementation, including VDRs covering the
major pillars of the reform which provided important background for detailed
engagement. While the PRSC operations provided financial support for implementing


                                           21
the SEDP, they disbursed against the upfront completion of a number of specific reform
measures identified within the SEDP agenda through consultation between partners and
the government, led by the World Bank. Implementation was also tightly linked to
supporting government systems, including a synchronized timing to feed into the formal
budget cycle.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

46.     Performance of the individual operations was assessed in Section 2.1, by
examining implementation experience and achievement of annual triggers and related
policy actions as completed prior actions. This section assesses the overall outcome of
PRSCs 6-10 by considering three dimensions of the program experience: (i) progress
against the specific outcome indicators found in the program’s monitoring framework, as
set forth in PRSC 6 and later modified under PRSC 10 (see Section 1.3); (ii) a qualitative
discussion of overall achievements and shortcomings in each of the four main pillars of
the program; and (iii) a review of process performance in the areas of policy dialogue and
donor harmonization, identified as secondary program objectives in Section 1.2.

47.     PRSCs 6-10 led to significant achievements in each of the four main pillars of the
government’s reform agenda, as measured by information available at completion of the
series on the outcome indicators in the monitoring matrix. Table 9 shows the
achievement of program monitoring indicators, with indication of the degree of progress,
if not fully met, or instances if the target was significantly exceeded. 10 Overall 9 out of
27 rated outcomes were highly satisfactory (in that the specified targets were exceeded),
seven satisfactory (progress fully met or with only minor shortcomings), two were
moderately satisfactory (progress with moderate shortcomings); three were moderately
unsatisfactory (progress significantly below target); two unsatisfactory (little or no
progress toward target); and four highly unsatisfactory (deterioration compared to
baseline). A detailed list of achievement by indicator is included in Section F of the
Basic Data Sheet at the front of this ICR. The following paragraphs in this section
discuss progress of indicators across the four main pillars, along with qualitative
achievements and consideration of the secondary process objectives.




10
   The assessment of progress of outcome indicators is based on the six-point rating methodology found in
the Implementation Completion and Results Report Guidelines (OPCS, Updated October 2011).

/1 Indicators were assessed according to the following methodology:
                          Highly Satisfactory - indicator exceeded; 6 points
                          Satisfactory - indicator target met or achieved with only minor shortcomings; 5 points

                          Moderately Unsatisfactory - progress observed but with major shortcomings; 3 points
                          Unsatisfactory - little or no progress toward indicator target; 2 points
                          Highly Unsatisfactory - deterioration relative to the baseline; 1 point
/2 "Share Sat" reflects highly satisfactory, satisfactory and moderately satisfactory as a share of rated indicators.


48.     In Pillar 1 (Business Development), there were important achievements in each of
the pillar’s five policy areas, though with significantly slower than expected performance
in the SOE and banking reform areas. The targets for the private sector infrastructure
indicators were all fully met or exceeded. Employment in the private sector achieved
nearly double the target of the program, increasing from 4 to 6.1 million paid employees
between 2005 and 2011, against a target of 5 million. Total private investment also met
its target of just over 35 percent of total investment. In the infrastructure sector, targets
for lowering the number of traffic fatalities and for electricity generated by non-ENV
entities were significantly exceeded.

49.      In the financial sector, the number of banks using qualitative criteria for loan
classification was targeted at five, relative to a baseline of none in 2005. The latest data
shows currently seven banks comply with this international standard. But since the
international standards consistent NPL ratios are not publicly disclosed, the compliance
has little relevance for depositors and regulators in the country. Despite considerable
effort made through PRSCs, there has been little progress in credibly estimating and
disclosing information concerning NPLs in the banking sector. There was a related
outcome indicator that called for the ratio of NPLs to fall to less than 5 percent of the
share of banks’ portfolios. 11 The NPL ratio as reported by the banks to SBV was 4.9
percent at the end of second quarter of 2012, which would mean the target has technically
been met. However, SBV’s own estimate of NPL ratio stands at 8.8 percent, implying


11
  The indicator should have noted the ratio of non-performing loans, instead of the provisioning ratio as
found in the program documents. This has been corrected in this ICR’s Data Sheet. The data reflect the
NPL ratio. The baseline and update are consistently defined in local accounting standards, which is the
current norm in Vietnam. Estimated figures based on international standards are 2-3 times as high.



                                                                  23
that the target has not been met. Independent analysts put the NPL ratio at a much higher
level. Therefore we conclude that this indicator was neither met in letter nor in spirit—
thereby assigning it an unsatisfactory rating.

50.     Achievements in state sector reform also fell below expectations. Of the two
related indicators, targets were met for one and unmet for the other. The government was
able to decrease the share of the state sector in GDP from 38 percent to 33 percent, as
targeted by the program, although some of this was achieved because of poor economic
performance of SOEs and reclassification of several SOEs as non-state enterprises. 12
The share of state investments in total investment fell less than targeted―from 47 percent
to 39 percent, against the target of 33 percent. SOE reform is difficult in many countries,
and Vietnam is no exception. In Vietnam, the equitization process slowed down after
2006 and the number of SOEs actually increased during the last year of PRSCs (see VDR
2012). In 2006, the government started a pilot program of establishing State Economic
Groups (SEGs) by banding together several SOEs operating in similar business lines
similar to the chaebols in South Korea. And it provided the SEGs preferred access to
land, bank credit, and gave them a high level of operational autonomy, but without little
oversight. The SEGs rather than becoming national champions, as planned by the
authorities, turned out to be mismanaged, inefficient and overextended enterprises that
started to fail—Vinashin, specializing in ship-building activities, was the first one to
default on its international bond, followed by Vinalines—forcing the government to
disband several SEGs. In such an environment, making progress on SOE reforms
became increasingly difficult and, unsurprisingly, some of the missed or adjusted triggers
in PRSCs 8-10 were in these areas. Considerable work in these areas is needed, and
follow-up DPLs will keep a sustained focus on SOE reforms.

51.     Achievements under Pillar 2 (Social Inclusion) were mixed. Of the four policy
areas, three (education, health and gender) showed a combination of one fully or mostly
met outcome indicator in the monitoring framework and one indicator showing
deterioration from the baseline. For education, the target for net enrolment of poor
children was met with very minor shortcomings, but learning outcomes in primary
schools dropped. In health, 100 percent of the proportion below the poverty line has
access to free health insurance, but the average annualized contacts with hospitals for the
poorest quintiles fell from a baseline of 0.15 to 0.12. And while the asset ownership
among women was 80 percent met (rising from 30 percent to 38 percent against a target
of 40 percent), the proportion of female delegates in the National Assembly fell from 27
percent in 2006 to 24 percent in 2011.

52.    Education was one of only four policy areas to have prior actions for each of the
five operations. The MOET appreciated the PRSC series, and they emphasized the “extra


12
   In Vietnam, when a SOE is equitized, irrespective of the size of the equitization (i.e., share of equity
held by non-state sector), the enterprise is classified as a non-state enterprise. For example, an enterprise in
which the government holds 95 percent of the equity and public holds 5 percent is considered as a non-state
enterprise. This goes on to explain to a certain extent the steady decline in the share of state sector in GDP.



                                                      24
push? the PRSC framework provided to their development of education policy. PRSC 8
supported the formulation of a sector strategy, one of the first for a ministry at the time.
This strategy was just approved this year, to align to the new five-year plan. The PRSCs
have also supported the shift in emphasis from access to services to quality, consistent
with Vietnam’s new standing as a middle-income country. The PRSC 10 prior action
was an achievement, with MOET issuing a regulation to institutionalize regular
nationwide assessments of student learning outcomes at primary and secondary levels. In
meetings for the ICR, the Ministry emphasized the lack of direct financial flows from
PRSC budget support, and an associated lack of incentive from individual departments in
the ministry. This has been partially addressed by policy dialogue outside the PRSC, via
a sectoral DPL that will allow the Ministry to decide with MOF how the funds are
allocated.

53.     As mentioned above, outcome indicators for Pillar 3 (Natural Resources) are
largely not able to be rated (4 of 6 indicators, comprising the majority of not rated
indicators). This reflects a general problem with defining all indicators in the monitoring
matrix, as noted in the mid-term review. For example, air and water quality indicators
were not defined at the beginning of the PRSC cycle. Data availability has been a
problem, and for water quality the science community advised in a workshop in
November 2009 that a single indicator would be more misleading than useful. The
indicator for the proportion of forest land allocated to local people and communities
showed a huge jump for all of the country (from 25 percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2011
against a target of 30 percent), but data for the Central Highlands is not available. The
one indicator with complete information relates to access to clean or improved water
sources. The targets for this indicator are above 90 percent for the urban population and
over 60 percent for rural. Current data show that the target for rural areas was far
exceeded, with 75 percent of the rural population now with access to clean or improved
water. However, there has been a deterioration relative to the baseline of 82 percent for
urban populations, down to 57 percent. Taken together, achievement of this target is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory given the higher proportion of urban population.

54.     There were important actions included in the PRSCs related to the environment
and to land and forests, though this largely reflected significant work outside the PRSC
framework. This pillar had lower relevance for the PRSC series, relative to others. A
case in point is the environment area, where there were important prior actions included
for PRSCs 8, 9 and 10 but in fact the donors had moved the policy dialogue outside the
framework. Donors decided in a clear and open way that based on the level of depth
needed on climate change policy dialogue, the Support Program to Respond to Climate
Change or SPRCC provided a better vehicle for policy action on climate change. A
sectoral DPL was prepared and approved six weeks after PRSC 10, in February 2012.
The technical guidelines for strategic environmental assessments included among PRSC
10 prior actions was produced by a Danish TA project, put into the PRSC to give this
work a higher profile.

55.    Performance in Pillar 4 (Modern Governance) was satisfactory, with five out of
seven rated outcome indicators assessed as satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Indicators



                                            25
were exceeded for: provinces adopting modern planning processes; the use of modern
budget management systems including live integrated treasury and budget management
information systems; and the proportion of provincial departments with one-stop shop
models for public administration. Public debt was kept below the target of threshold of
55 percent of GDP. The one rated indicator for the corruption policy area was fully met –
the latest survey data reports only 5 percent of enterprises facing major or severe
corruption obstacles and the remainder noting no obstacle from corruption. On the
negative side, there was no progress in getting any provinces to issue guidelines for
public investment screening, against a target of two provinces.

56.      Key PFM contributions from the PRSC series were made in the areas of external
audit, budget transparency and enhanced management of public debt. The State Audit of
Vietnam (SAV) was established as a specialized agency under the National Assembly
shortly before PRSC 6. The new group appreciated the PRSC framework as a means to
build capacity through participation in technical meetings. The prior actions pushed the
agenda on disclosure of audit reports and developing the regulation on internal audit.
Implementation on the latter has lagged, and remains a challenge for the government with
only three ministries with capacity for an internal audit function. Vietnam’s Law on
Public Debt Management 2009 was a prior action for PRSC 8 and was a milestone in
establishing the legal framework to cover both domestic and external debt.
Implementation of this legal framework continues, with support from the World Bank.
The DMEFD was identified as the main debt management entity but in practice several
activities are carried out by other entities. Debt management activities have been audited
over the past years. However, the SAV needs to expand its coverage to conform to the
Public Debt Law and to conduct performance audit of debt management activities. That
will in turn require some increase in capacity.

57.      It is difficult to attribute success or failure in the attainment of specific PDOs to
any one or even a group of policy actions taken under the PRSC program. Nevertheless,
it would be hard to believe that the improvements in many of the outcome indicators used
to track progress of the reform program (see Results Framework in the Basic Data Sheet),
did not significantly benefit from PRSC policy actions. Outside assessments of the PRSC
series support this, including the EU and IEG evaluations. 13 At the same time, the rapid
pace of economic changes has created significant policy and institutional challenges for
Vietnam. This is partly due to the country’s steady integration into the global economy,
including with WTO accession in 2007, which brought higher flows of foreign direct and
portfolio investments and helped to boost international trade. This has exposed Vietnam
to increased commodity price volatility and financial turbulence in the global economy as
well as the effects of slower growth in North America and Europe. With its market-based
institutions still not uniformly developed, the country has found it increasingly difficult to

cope with this new economic environment. Additionally, implementation of PRSC
reforms highlighted new challenges that had to be addressed in existing areas. There was
an element of learning by doing as policies and institutions changed, but the
organizations implementing them were still adapting. As a result the engagement under
the PRSC was deepening in a smaller number of areas.

58.     The assessment of the outcome under the PRSC 6-10 program should also include
consideration of achievements under important process objectives of the program. These
operations fully achieved the very important process dimensions of the overall
government-partner relationship that were established under the first PRSC series. First,
the second PRSC series continued the role of the series in providing the main platform
for high-level policy dialogue between government and partners, and provided an
important signaling mechanism that the overall policy directions and progress of the
government were on track. Senior level government engagement in the PRSC operations
rose to the level of the Deputy Prime Minister, whose office was active in focusing
efforts on particularly important or contentious policy actions. Second, the second PRSC
series served as the main platform for donor harmonization, with positive feedback for
the overall program from involved donors. Through the PRSC operations and the formal
engagement mechanisms discussed earlier, external partner engagement on policy
dialogue with the authorities was coordinated and harmonized, predictability of large
financial flows was enhanced and the transactions costs of government from donor
engagement were greatly reduced. These views were broadly shared across government
and donors.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: The Overall Outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory. This rating covers
the program based on the overall programmatic series.

59.     The PRSC 6-10 series was relevant to the policy dialogue in Vietnam, and
contributed to the country’s successful achievement of middle income status. The
objectives were fully consistent with the objectives of the SEDP 2006-2010, the Bank’s
CAS and the reform agenda of Vietnam’s major development partners. Pillars 1 and 4
related to growth and governance were appropriately emphasized more in the course of
program implementation as domestic and global economic concerns emerged. The
PRSCs were also complemented by the emergence of sector and thematic DPLs as the
policy dialogue deepened to second generation reforms (e.g., power and climate change).

60.     Achievements of the PDOs varied across the main pillars, but are considered on
balance to be moderately satisfactory with the PRSCs contributing substantially to the
successful implementation by GoV of the SEDP 2006-2010. The majority of the rated
outcome indicators in the monitoring matrix were fully achieved or exceeded. Two-
thirds were at least moderately satisfactorily achieved. In addition, achievements
reflected in the policy actions substantially furthered the reform agenda. Achievements
were strongest in the growth-related and governance areas, which were the most relevant
pillars during the implementation period. Achievements in the other two pillars of social
inclusion and natural resource management were more mixed, with results in these seven


                                              27
policy areas showing moderate shortcomings overall, and even deterioration in a few
areas. In addition, the process objectives of providing a high-level policy dialogue
platform and harmonizing donor support on a large scale were both achieved with only
minor shortcomings. At the same time, the rapid pace of economic changes has created
significant policy and institutional challenges for Vietnam. Additionally, implementation
of PRSC reforms highlighted new challenges that had to be addressed in existing areas,
with some noted loss of reform momentum towards the end of the series as some donors
adjusted their support to the country’s newly achieved middle-income status. However,
on balance, the Overall Outcome Rating of the PRSC 6-10 program for Vietnam is
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61.     An in-depth PSIA was carried out for the first operation in the series (PRSC 6)
followed by two shorter PSIAs for subsequent operations in the series to assess whether
any of the measures in the triggers or policy actions were expected to have adverse
distributional consequences, or adverse impacts on the poor. Adverse impacts would
trigger measures to protect the poor from these, as described in PRSC 6. No adverse
impacts were identified in PRSC 7–PRSC 10. In fact, a number of policy measures were
expected to have favorable impacts, primarily operating through higher and more
inclusive economic growth.

62.    PRSC 6 discussed some policies that might require additional measures to protect
the poor, e.g., moving to market-determined tariffs for infrastructure (notably in the case
of power), increasing school fees for upper secondary and tertiary schooling. But these
measures were pursued through DPOs in respective sectors.

63.    While the Bank was involved in a number of analytic and advisory activities
involving poverty reduction issues during the period covered by PRSCs 6-10, it is widely
recognized that much of this dialogue did not take place under the aegis of the PRSC(s).
Moreover, with the approval of Program P135—a DPO series to support government’s
nationally targeted anti-poverty program—some of the policy dialogue on poverty
reduction issues took place outside the PRSC(s) ambit.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.     The PRSC series pioneered the promotion of gender issues in a budget support
operation. It supported a series of reforms on gender mainstreaming including the
creation of Gender Equality Department (GED) and approval of National Statistics on
Gender Indicators (NSGI). GED is gradually emerging as a major advocate of gender
reforms in the country and the roll-out of NSGI will help to strengthen GED’s capacity to
monitor and report on progress relating to gender issues.

65.    The PRSC series supported the establishment of separate legal, economic and
budget committees as a way to strengthen the supervisory role of the National Assembly.


                                            28
This step along with UNDP’s support to strengthen the capacity of the various
Committees of the National Assembly has helped to transform the National Assembly as
a voice of reform and progress in the country.

66.    There are many such examples of institutional building activities supported by the
PRSC series. But not all efforts led to successful outcomes. For example, there was an
attempt to enhance the autonomy of SBV in PRSC 8 by revising the Law of State Bank
of Vietnam, though by most accounts the de facto autonomy of SBV has not changed
markedly since the revision of this law.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

67.     The global financial crisis, as well as the food price shock that preceded it, were
two impacts that could not have been foreseen. The Bank (as well as other development
partners and the IMF) reacted in a coherent fashion to offset the impact of the crises. The
Bank quickly processed a financing operation for US$ 200 million, supplemental to
PRSC 8 to provide additional budget support as the government implemented a rescue
package during FY09/10 to counter the negative macroeconomic shock from the financial
crisis.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: The Risk to Development Outcomes rating is Moderate.

68.     Vietnam faces important short-term domestic macroeconomic management
challenges. While foreign exchange reserves have more than doubled in 2012, it is low
compared to international levels. The ongoing domestic credit bust could further worsen
both growth prospects and asset quality. Another risk is the authorities’ departure from
fiscal and monetary discipline prompting inflation resurgence. This could unravel gains
already made and further weaken confidence.

69.     A similar risk, where potential growth will be severely compromised, could arise
from delayed and poor implementation of structural reforms including the resolution of
bad debts in banks and SOEs. Vietnam is also vulnerable to the effects of a prolonged
global economic slowdown, which could adversely affect exports, remittances, foreign
investment, and possibly aid. Although it has managed to navigate the 2008/09 crisis
reasonably well through implementation of a large stimulus package, fiscal space is now
limited because of high levels of public debt and large contingent liabilities from a weak
banking sector and poorly managed SOEs.

70.     Vietnam, generally considered as a politically stable country, has recently faced
some uncertainty about key leadership positions. Its top leadership has admitted mistakes
in the management of some areas of the economy and vowed to rectify the situation. The
National Assembly has recently adopted a proposal to undertake a ‘vote of confidence’
on senior policymakers every year. While this will make the government more
accountable to its citizens, it does open the possibility of periodic changes in personnel



                                            29
and policy. The impact of this new direction in governance on economic management
could be positive, but remains to be seen.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Ratings: The Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry rating is Satisfactory.

71.     The design of this second PRSC series followed the best practice guidelines for
PRSC operations. The authorities’ continued strong commitment to the reform agenda
meant that linking to country systems as fully as possible was appropriate. Bank staff
made the right assessment that programmatic policy lending continued to be an
appropriate instrument for achieving the objective of providing a broad platform for
policy dialogue between development partners and the government. Lessons of the first
PRSC series were followed, including the need to have a comprehensive approach to
economic reform to leverage linkages across sectors agenda. The operations focused on
strategically relevant issues. As main coordinator, Bank staff took on a large amount of
the transactions costs associated with the PRSC series. Together with the government,
the PRSC process was made more transparent and open to international partners.

72.     The high quality of the Bank’s technical inputs that supported the design of the
overall program as well as individual operations was appreciated by both development
partners and government. Environmental aspects and other safeguards were covered.
Fiduciary aspects were well managed, and risk assessments were realistic. And Bank
inputs and processes were adhered to, including seeking advice from a wide circle of
people. Quality at entry was satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: The Bank Performance for Quality of Supervision rating is Satisfactory.

73.     The Bank has successfully developed and managed a detailed and time-
consuming process for monitoring implementation that has proved robust in Vietnam’s
environment of strong government commitment to reform. Stakeholders highly
appreciate the overall management of the PRSC process by the Bank, and recognize the
important role this has played in overall relations with the government, including in areas
beyond the specific policy actions of the operations. Through a predictable and
transparent process of developing the policy matrices for each operation, the Bank has
helped keep the breadth of the policy dialogue tractable. Noted aspects of this process
include the annual preparation of detailed “one pagers? on each policy area and the
annual “refresher? workshop with donors to review broad goals and context of the PRSC
program. Through Bank leadership, this process delivered a strong level of policy
coordination among external partners, which was impressive given the high number of
active donors in the country. A key contributing factor for this success was the presence


                                            30
of seasoned and empowered sector staff in the field office in many of the sector policy
areas.

74.     With such a wide platform for policy dialogue, the quality of reform efforts
inevitably differed across sectors. On balance, the Bank managed a difficult process
during the PRSC series of triangulating critical reforms with the government’s chosen
extent and timing of progress. The Bank also worked behind the scenes in working with
resource people with close contacts in government and the Party to get a sense of reform
entry points and bottlenecks (e.g., WTO accession, banking reform and public
investment). This approach provided critical insights to reform efforts and also helped
develop trust between the Bank and government. Quality of Supervision was
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: The Overall Bank Performance rating is Satisfactory.

75.     According to ICR guidelines, the overall ratings are dictated by the combination
of ratings for Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision. This implies a rating of
Satisfactory for overall Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

76.    Note that the government performance is for the overall government including all
line ministries involved in various reforms under SEDP 2006-2010. Implementing
agency performance covers the SBV only, in their capacity as overall coordinator of the
PRSC series on the government side.

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: The Government Performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

77.     Government ownership and commitment to reform actions and achieving
development objectives for the program as a whole has been moderately satisfactory.
The authorities exhibited a strong and sustained push to meet the high level goal of
achieving middle income status during this PRSC series, which yielded a positive
enabling environment for the reform dialogue especially in the first half of the series.
However, the commitment to key structural issues waned in the later part of the series,
for example in the SOE reform and banking policy areas. This can be partially explained
by the occupation of the authorities on the domestic and external macroeconomic
challenges as well as the Party Congress in 2010-2011 as well as a general slowdown in
the momentum for structural reforms. The relations with donors remained broadly
satisfactory throughout the period, with regular and productive consultations.

78.    Performance on fiduciary arrangements can be considered satisfactory to the
extent that the government has paid considerable attention to improving PFM



                                            31
arrangement, and that these were considered adequate by donors to support budget
support operations.

79.     Development of the monitoring and evaluation framework for the SEDP, and
hence the basis for the PRSC series, has been mixed. This has often been one of the
weakest aspects of planning processes in developing countries, and Vietnam is not alone
in this aspect. The proliferation of indicators (more than 130 for SEDP 2006-2010) has
been noted elsewhere, and the government did not make significant progress in focusing
monitoring efforts during the program. The Bank eventually narrowed the list of
monitoring indicators at the time of PRSC 10 presentation to the Board. Availability of
data on the monitoring and evaluation framework indicators was mixed. At the time of
this ICR, a significant number of indicators remain not rated due to lack of updated
information. However, on balance, government performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings: The Implementing Agency Performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

80.     The SBV was the focal point on the government side throughout the PRSC series,
and the Bank’s official counterpart throughout the program. The view of Bank staff,
donors and other government groups interviewed for the ICR is that SBV performance
has been very positive. Technical meetings were coordinated by the PRSC Coordination
Unit at the SBV, and could involve as many as 100 meetings for a single operation. The
SBV did an effective job in convening line ministries for these meetings, and providing
the opportunity to go into the specifics of each policy action, to comment on draft policy
documents and to agree on a timeframe for their completion. Coordination among many
line ministries that often do not appreciate the policy linkages (e.g., PFM and
effectiveness of social sector spending) was demanding. As a result of these meetings,
under the leadership of SBV, some measures were deemed completed, some consolidated
and others postponed. The SBV also effectively reported upward to the Steering
Committee for the PRSC process, which was chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister.
Performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: The Overall Borrower Performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

81.     According to ICR guidelines, the overall ratings are dictated by the combination
of ratings for Government Performance and Implementing Agency Performance. Based
on the individual assessments, this implies a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for overall
Borrower performance.

6. Lessons Learned

82.    The PRSC series provides a rich set of experience from which to draw important
lessons, both specifically for the Vietnam context as well as for programmatic policy
lending elsewhere.

83.     Breadth versus depth? The breadth of the reform undertaking and linkages among
policy actions across sectors called for a comprehensive approach to dialogue and support
by development partners. The strong track record of government commitment and
adoption by partners of the PRSC series to match government priorities and processes
made this approach work. This was a key lesson from the experience during the first
PRSC series that was implemented between 2001 and 2006. The PRSCs served as an
effective platform for a broad policy dialogue, and also provided a mandate for signaling
the support of the international community. Success of the first PRSC series meant it
became a popular instrument to bring about policy change and therefore its scope
expanded and this at times came at the cost of depth. Also, achievement of middle-
income status had implications for the aid architecture. Several development partners
withdrew or reduced their development assistance to Vietnam, in accordance with their
aid practices for middle-income countries. The number of co-financiers peaked at 11 for
PRSCs 6 and 7 and has fallen since, with some impact on the total level of financing
under the PRSCs. Some switched their focus to more specialized policy-based
operations, as deeper reforms were identified in the PRSC policy dialogue. Thus while
the PRSC was an excellent instrument to use IDA resources for a low-income Vietnam, a
transition is now needed for less wholesale participation and more focused policy
dialogue.

84.      Importance of analytical work. Analytical work gives insight on inter-linkages
across individual policy areas, as well as cross-cutting issues, and helps ensure they are
appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported under the operation. The PRSC
series have built on analytical work, including the Vietnam Development Report (VDR)
series, and this is highly regarded by the government as a significant value-added to the
dialogue. VDRs at the start of the program and continuing through implementation were
led by the Bank with a large number of development partners participating, several of
them making extensive contributions. Topics were chosen to link closely with the policy
actions supported by the PRSCs, including individual reports covering each of the four
pillars in turn. These analytical reports improved the quality of technical discussions
between government and partners. Part of this success can be attributed to the Bank
convening resource persons that were well connected and respected by policy makers
(i.e., senior government officials and the Party).

85.     The new series of programmatic development policy lending is taking this broad
lesson on board, driven by a new SEDP report covering 2011-2015. Though focused on
only two of four pillars of the last PRSC series, policy coordination that reflects linkages
in policy areas requires a strong analytical foundation to inform directions and specific
decisions. For example, weaknesses in the banking sector are closely linked to the
performance of SOEs, which in turn is associated with inefficiencies in public



                                            33
investments. Dedicated and adequate resources for analytical work and short-term
technical assistance should enable the government and development partners to assess the
potential impacts of related policy actions and help refine the proposals.

86.     Donor coordination can strengthen the policy dialogue and deliver benefits to the
client … The PRSC series served as an effective framework for policy dialogue and
interactions between the government and donors. The benefits were fundamental and
manifold, as supported by a number of outside evaluations. An Independent Evaluation
Group review in 2009 found the Vietnam PRSC series to be exemplary in its
predictability, continuity, and development partner coordination. The PRSCs were the
“one-stop shop? of the policy dialogue, though sector/thematic DPLs emerged late in the
series as reform dialogue deepened, and hence raised to a more senior level of
government attention than any individual sector effort would have. The role of co-
financiers under the PRSC evolved over time from providers of financing to partners
engaged in the preparation of the operations and the policy dialogue with the government.
This engagement was unprecedented. Information flows from the government expanded
as trust with the Bank and other partners deepened. And not least, this coordination also
greatly reduced the transaction costs for the government ministries and agencies. The
authorities have voiced their keen appreciation on this front.

87.     ….but it comes at a cost. The large number of development partners,
ministries/agencies, and policy actions imposed significant coordination and logistical
costs on the World Bank, even though it helped to reduce transaction costs for the
government. The coordination of PRSCs became progressively more difficult as the
number of participating partners increased, peaking in PRSCs 6 and 7. For PRSC 6, there
were 198 policy actions proposed through the consultation process among partners,
which the Bank had to manage into a concise list of possible triggers to discuss with the
authorities. There were disagreements on many fronts among development partners
including what constitute priority reforms, whether a particular reform is desirable or
feasible, and whether enough progress has been made in a given policy area to warrant
recognition. This required significant time and energy, especially given the annual cycle
of the program.

88.     Incentives for line ministries. Government line ministries voiced concern that
financial flows from the PRSCs went directly into the State Budget, and their
participation in the often time-intensive policy dialogue did not result in direct budgetary
increases. Benefits were certainly recognized but the lack of direct budgetary benefits
was a disincentive for line ministry participation. Modalities for these types of multi-
sector DPLs are needed to create and preserve the interest of and incentives to
participating line ministries. This may include more technical assistance, which line
ministries appreciate, or direct links to subsequent project support. A related lesson is
that multi-sectoral DPLs may be best suited to ministries that have clear and strong policy
linkages, and where improved policy coordination is a primary objective. In other cases,
sector DPLs may be more appropriate. For example, the series of DPLs that emerged in
the power sector were noted to provide direct resources to the relevant ministries, which
added significant incentives for their participation.

89.     Designing the results framework. The PRSC experience highlights some of the
key challenges in designing and implementing monitoring frameworks for programmatic
policy-based lending, which are inherently difficult. Challenges arise from the fact that
specific direct and indirect effects of many development policies are difficult to monitor
and quantify with precision. In addition, many desired outcomes that are targeted by
related policy actions are also influenced by many other factors, making attribution a
continuing challenge. This underscores the importance of deriving sensible intermediate
indicators that can be linked directly with expected policy actions. This was a weakness
in the PRSC monitoring matrix, which contributed to a lack of clarity of how policy
actions in a particular area tied together and over time worked toward a specific goal.
Some degree of fine-tuning of indicators over time is expected for a programmatic series
of operations covering a five-year horizon. However, this should have been more clearly
articulated up front in the series, and contributed to setting of expectations that were
notably overly optimistic at the start of the series. There were also a significant share of
indicators unable to be rated at the completion of the series, even after a significant
adjustment to the monitoring matrix after the mid-term review. In light of the perceived
weakness in GoV’s focus on results, a key lesson of the PRSC experience is that more
active collaboration with government on this front would have benefitted both sides. In
light of these weaknesses, the Vietnamese experience demonstrates the need to
complement consideration of outcome indicators by looking at qualitative assessments of
achievements and also at complementary objectives, for example important process
functions in the case of Vietnam that are fundamental to donor-government relations.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

         In general, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) agrees with the World Bank’s assessment in
the draft ICR. However, the SBV would like to make some additional comments as follows:

1.       The report gives a general assessment of the PRSCs 6-10 performance, which contributed
to achieving the overall objectives of the SEDP 2006-2010, bringing Vietnam into the lower
middle-income countries. However, to further clarify the program performance, the report should
clearly identify outcomes of each sectoral reform implemented in the program. For reforms in the
banking sector, the Program was designed with a total of 12 actions, including 5 prior actions and
7 trigger actions. These actions supported SBV in building the State Bank Law 2010 and a
number of regulations on banking activities oriented moving towards international standards,
especially banking supervision and information disclosure. Thanks to the Program, operations of
the State Bank have become more efficient, focusing primarily on the monetary policy, ensuring
the system safety and increasing competitiveness, contributing significantly to meeting
development needs of the economy.

2.      In addition, there should be further analysis of multi-sectoral reforms, although these
reforms have not fully achieved the expected outcomes.

3.       Paragraph 28 should be added that the Government has always concerned and created
favorable conditions for an effective program implementation. Specifically, one Deputy Prime
Minister was appointed as Head of the Program Steering Committee. This movement has
facilitated the Government Leaders in closely guiding and timely handling problems arising
during the course of implementation. Therefore, the Program has been ensured to best support the
SEDP implementation over the past period. The state authorities have been always determined
and placed the Program with high priority. As a result, most of policy actions have been
implemented following their schedule.

4.      Paragraph 29 should not mention too much about the SEDP construction, but focus more
on the participation process of the PRSC policy action framework development. This process
involved the participation of a numerous state authorities, co-donors and other stakeholders.
Many open discussions were held to facilitate the participation from stakeholders. The issues
raised were actively discussed, reviewed by the parties for a several rounds before coming to a
final decision. Consequently, the program design has harmonized needs of the parties and
possessed high feasibility.

5.       It should be added to Paragraph 30 that the co-donors have been very interested in and
facilitated the Program implementation through annual grants provided to the PRSC Coordination
Committee. As a result, the State Bank’s coordination has been conducted effectively and best
supported the Program.

6.      The State Bank would like to add that: The Program has done well the technology
transfer in planning as well as technical issues. Therefore, consequent operations have been
executed with more favorable conditions than the previous ones. This element has significantly
contributed to the success of the Program.

7.     The following points should be supplemented to the assessment of the World Bank
performance:



                                               41
     - The World Bank has performed well the role of a development assistance organization by
       successfully designing and implementing the Program, contributing to the achievement of
       the SEDP 2010-2006 objectives. The Program has been not only highly complemented by
       the Government but also acknowledged by the donor community.
     - The World Bank has well conducted the assistance coordination role in the Program
       through mobilizing many donors to involve in and commit funding the Program (nearly
       US$ 900 million). In addition to monetary support, many donors also provided necessary
       technical assistance to help the Government fulfilling policy actions set out in the Program.

8.       Additional assessment to the Borrower’s performance:

     - The Government has been always interested in, closely directed the Program to be
       designed in accordance with the periodical socio-economic development plans, through
       which the SEDP implementation was well supported.
     - In general, the Program’s preparation and implementation have received adequate
       concerns and close cooperation from the state authorities. This has facilitated the Program
       to be completed in accordance with the planned roadmap.
     - The engaging staff has been qualified, capable and dedicated to the Program. This is the
       critical factor, contributing to the Program’s success.

9.      As for the lessons learned: apart from the achievements, a number of problems must be
addressed as follows:

     - Normally, a PRSC Program is designed for one calendar year, while several policy actions
       relating to legal document promulgation sometimes depend on the working program of
       higher-level agencies. As a result, those policy actions have not met the deadline set by the
       Program.
     - The state authorities have been actively involved, but there are issues requiring inter-
       sectoral coordination by common administrative procedures, which have resulted in loss
       of time and affected the overall progress.
     - The Program has tended to expand actions and areas, which have sometimes caused
       spreading and lack of concentration.
     - The donors have usually not been decided at the beginning of the Program, while depend
       on their fiscal year. This has created certain passiveness in the Government’s budgeting
       process. There are many funding sources from donors with different requirements, which
       have created certain difficulties in the disbursement process.
     - There are some difficulties resulting from the disharmonized reporting requirements from
       donors.
10.   Regarding design of the subsequent program: please take the Borrower's Implementation
Completion and Result Report as reference.

Annex 5. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The strength of Vietnam PRSC series can be seen in the number of co-financiers it attracted. The
feedback received from the co-financiers on how they see the strengths and weakness of the
PRSC program are summarized as follows: 14
Strengths/Benefits:
 Donor harmonization - The PRSC was successful in creating a common platform for policy
    dialogue with the Government and thereby enhanced donor harmonization. It benefitted the
    donors by allowing them greater exposure to a broader policy reform platform and profited
    the government by reducing transaction cost of operating with each donor individually.
    Leveraging resources and policy impact –The PRSC helped donors, especially the smaller
     bilateral ones, to better align their programs to GoV priorities and thereby leverage more
     financial and technical resources for the country. The access to technical assistance in turn
     helped the government to undertake preparatory work to achieve the policy triggers and thus
     increased the policy impact of PRSCs.
    Keeping reform momentum alive – During the last few years, when reform momentum was
     waning, PRSC was instrumental in keeping the GoV on an agreed course of reform and to
     impress the government to continue to undertake some difficult and politically less-popular
     reforms involving state-owned sector and financial sector.
    Analytical work underpinning PRSCs – At the start of this five-year PRSC cycle, the
     Vietnam Development Report – Aiming High, provided a good analytical base on which to
     set out a policy reform agenda which matched the GoV’s SEDP 2006-2010.
Challenges/ Areas for Improvement:
 Results framework - The results frameworks for PRSCs was weak since the M&E
   framework of SEDP, on which it was based, was vague with ill-defined indicators, imprecise
   benchmarks and considerable delay in release of data.
    Annual cycle – A major challenge for the PRSC was the rapid annual timeframe within
     which policy reforms are meant to be agreed, formulated and completed. Towards end of
     PRSC process this problem aggravated resulting in triggers being dropped, replaced or
     softened and thereby taking the emphasis away from the quality of the program.
    Ownership and quality of policy dialogue –Technical meetings did not include senior-level
     government representatives, making it difficult to discuss policy issues, to jointly identify key
     reforms, as well as ensuring GoV commitment to the reform and dialogue process. The depth
     of sectoral-level engagement also suffered because of this.
    Quality of policy reform – Some donors felt that PRSCs had no clear storyline, triggers
     appeared ad hoc with no obvious sequencing and there was inadequate emphasis on poverty
     reduction initiatives. Others felt that PRSC did not touch on sensitive areas (e.g. Press law,
     Access to Information Law), leaving donors and GoV working from agreed-upon policy
     measures which are less ambitious.
