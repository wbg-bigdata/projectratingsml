MEMORANDUPM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ENTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIC i AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLC OF INDONESIA FOR THE
SUMATERA AND KALIMANTAN POWER PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic
of Indonesia for $260.5 million, to help finance the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project, is
submitted for approval. The proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan, except $3.2 million for
technical assistance to the Ministry of Mmes and Energy (GOI), would be onlent to the State
Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years including a grace period of five years. The subsidiary loan
will be denominated in US dollars and the onlending interest rate would be equal to the Bank's
standard variable interest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. PLN will bear the foreign exchange risk.
The project is intended to be cofinanced on a parallel basis by export credits from OECF, Japan and
bilateral cofinancing by the Governments of Austria and Australia.
2.          Background. Indonesia's power sector has grown rapidliv during the 1980s and 1990s.
PLN's instaled capacity increased five-fbld from 2,288 MW in 1978 to 10,874 MW in 1992, as its
sales grew at aTI annual average rate of 16 percent from 4,287 GWh in 1978 to 34,964 CTWh in 1992.
In spite of this rapid growth, there is considerable unmet demand at economic prices. While Java-Bali
has an extensive interconnected grid systcm with a large number of central generating plants, a
relatively high load facior, and high capacity transmission lines (500 kV), the Outer Islands (islands
other than Java-Bali) have fragmented, low capacity (150 kV or lower) transmission systems, with
small, isolated diesel generators and low load factors.
3.          Lessons Learned. Since 1969, the Bank has provided about $4.1 billion for the power
sector, through three IDA Credits, 18 loans and one supplemental loan. Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPARs) and Project Completion Reports (PCRs) on the first 14 projects have concluded that
the Bank has made positive contributions towards the developmenm of the Indonesian power sector over
the past 20 years by improving PLN's project implementation, operational and managerial capabilities
and helping Indonesia meet critical demands for electricity. In particular, over the period 1983-1992,
PLN's transmission and distribution losses have decreased from 21 percent to 12 percent; annual
energy sales per employee have increased from 223 MWh to 627 MWh; and overall consumers'
accounts receivable have decreased from 68 to 36 days' sales. However, after decades of rapid
expansion in electricity service, Indonesia's power sector is now at a crossroads. Incremental
improvements will not suffice to meet the objectives the Governmert has set for the sector. A
comprehensive sector development policy agenda is called for to sustain rapid and balanced growth.
Capacity building in the Outer Islands, that has generally lagged behind, also requires specific
improvements.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed Sumatera and Kalimantan Power
Project, in conjunction with the subsequent Rural Electrification II Project, forms an integral part of
the Bank's lending strategy for Indonesia. The two projects are supporting the initial phase of a
comprehensive policy agenda of the Government for the country's power sector. The Government has
drawn on direct support from Bank staff and technical assistance from ongoing Bank loans in
developing the agenda for actions: (a) opening the sector for substantial private investorloperator
participation; (b) restructuring the dominant public power utility PLN; (c) establishing effective
regulatory oversight; (d) reforming power tariffs; and (e) enhancing energy efficiency. These actions



- 2 -
will, by ensuring cost effective expansion of reliable electricity services. contribute to strengthening
.the competitiveness of Indonesia's productive and service sectors, as well as to enhancing the welfare
of the population at large. Through its focus on the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan, the proposed
project will also support directly the Government's drive for achieving more balanced inter-regional
development and substitutior of oil-fired generation. With these main features, the project is fully
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on April 12, 1994. Taking
into account the conclusions from its dialogue with the Bank, the Government has determined that
fundamental changes are needed for efficient long-run developnent of the power sector in Indonesia.
The Government has expressed its strategy in a Policy Statement, "Goals and Policies for the
Development of the Electric Power Sector". This statement forms the basis for implementing the
power sector agenda and associated Bank support.
5.           Government Strategy. Encouraging Private Sector Participation. The recently signed
agreement with a consortium of private investors for 2 x 600 MW generating units at PLN's Paiton
Thermal Power Project site, and the Cikarang Listrindo Project in Bekasi, demonstrates the
Government's wil!.ngness to open the sector effectively to private sector participation. However,
private sector participation in the power sector is still constrained by a lack of clear rules. Among the
initiatives to provide transparency for the private sector are: bulk purchase power tariffs, pegged to
PLN's avoided costs, which will encourape efficient participation in electricity generation by small
private producers. Similarly, a bulk power supply tariff, based on PLN's economic cost of supply,
will encourage efficient private sector participation in distribution. Further, a "transmission service
tariff' would permit independent producers to sell power directly to consumers by "wheeling" power
from their generating facihities to the co:isumers, and paying PLN a fee for utilizing its ransmission
network. The GOI is planning to introduce the bulk power purchase and supply tariffs, and is engaged
in a dialogue with the Bank on this issue. Concrete actions in these areas will be part of the Bank's
next power sector lending operation (Rural Electrification Il).
6.           Restructuring PLN. The GOI has decided, based on Bank analytical work, as well as
Bank financed tachnical assistance, to improve PLN's financial performance and the quality and
efficiency of its services. The initial plan is towards establishing profit centers along functional
(generation, transmission, and distribution) and geographical lir , with the managers of these profit
centers given enhanced decision-making responsibilities and made accountable for their performance.
A key element of the GOI's strategy is to commercialize PLN's operations, and transform its corporate
status from a company with a social purpose (Perum) to a group of profit-oriented limited liability
companies (Perseros). Private participation in their ownership is likely to be considered by the GOI
as soon as their financial performance permits.
7.           Changing Regulations and Institutions. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) has
been reviewing the organization, institutional set up and regulatory oversight functions of the sector.
The first decisions have been taken in this respect. Specifically, the GOI has initiated action to
strengthen regulatory functions in view of the growing role of private investors and operators in the
power sector. In this context, the GOI is establishing a systematic approach for dealing with solicited
and unsolicited proposals from interested private power investors, and expanding the options for
private sector participation beyond BOO schemes (e.g., cogeneration, purchase of electricity from
captive generators, licensing private generation in industrial estates and franchising geographical areas
to licensees for the generation and/or distribution of electricity, and access to PLN transmission
facility).
8.          Rationalizing Power Tariffs. The GOI recognizes the importance of pricing electricity
to ensure both efficiency in electricity consumption and sound financial foundation of PLN to
undertake its ambitious investment program. The GO is committed to raising power tariffs as needed



- 3 -
to ensure that PLN will attain the stipulated rate of return in its operations. Procedures for periodic,
formula-based adjustments to PLN's tariffs to take account of variations in fuel and purchase power
prices, exchange rate, and inflation have been approved by the Government and are planned .o be
introduce] in the near future. In order to avoid uncertainty and disruption on account of infrequent
ad hoc major tariff increases, the GOI is now considering the modalities of institutionalizing such
adjustments. The revenue covenant under the proposed loan would require for PLN to realize for all
its operations, for its fiscal year 1994 and in each fiscal year thereafter, an annual rate of return of not
less than eight percent (8%) on its average net revalued fixed assets in operation.
9.          Enhancing Energy Efficiency. The GOI plans to complement its pricing policies by
encouraging, inter alia, sound electricity use decisions.  To this effect, the GOI is planning
introduction of renewable energy in the rural areas, and to broaden its demand management (DSM)
efforts.
10.         Project Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project are to support the first
phase of the Government's long-term policy agenda for the pcwer sector aimed at efforts to:
(a) increase private sector participation to accelerate expansion of generating capacity and upgrade
sector operating standards and practices; (b) restructure PLN to improve its operational performance
and sorvice efficiency; (c) formulate and implement regulations along with supporting administrative
arrangements to promote efficiency in sector operations; and (d) introduce a formula-based periodic
taff adjustment mechanism to recover costs. In addition, the proposed project is to help finance
environmentally sustainable expansion of PLY's electricity generation and transmission capacity in the
islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan with more economical central grid systems, as well as provide
technical assistance to the GOI and PLN in the areas of demand management, effciency improvement
and environmental management.
11.         Project Desiption.  The policy component of the proposed project entails:
(a) establishing a policy framework for private sector participation; (b) restructuring PLN and
establishing it as a commercial entity and a limited liability company (Persero); and (c) implementing
a framework for regulatory oversight of the private sector and PLN.
12.         The physical components of the project include: (a) construction of a hydroelectric
power plant with a generating canacity of 90 MW at Besai and related transmission facilities in South
Sumatera; (b) construction of a mine-mouth lignite fired thermal power plant with an initial generating
capacity of 130 MW at Asam Asam near Banjarmasin and related transmission facilities in South
Kalimantan; (c) procurement of two barge-mounted power plants of 10 MW ane-d0 MW capacity,
which would be powered by diesel engines and gas turbines, respectively.
13.         The technical assistance components include:  (i) engineering and construction
supervision of Besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power plants; (ii) strengthening the
capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (GO1) in environmental management in the coal mining
sector; (iii) strengthening the environmental management capability of PLN; (iv) promoting demand
management; and (v) implementing pilot projects for PLN's Regions IV and VI in South Sumatera and
South Kalimantan respectively to improve their operating efficiency. In addition to these technical
assistance activities, consulting services are being funded under ongoing loans (Lns. 3385-IND,
3501-IND, and 3602-IND) for carrying out the studies for the above-mentioned (para.11) policy
components.
14.         The project is estimated to cost the equivalent of US$688.9 million, inclusive of the
interest during construction, as shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The timetable for key project

processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Indonesia are shown in Schedules C and
D respectively. Related maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed
separately (No. 12662-IND dated May 23, 1994).
15.         Environmental Aspects and Resettlement. The project will be designed, constructed,
and operated in compliance with the applicable environmental regulations and guidelines of the Bank
as well as of the Government of Indonesia. (a) Besai Hydroelectric Plant. The total area to be
acquired is about 200 ha, out of which about 140 ha will be inundated. Even though no physical
relocation is involved, 129 families will need to be provided with resettlement compensation. (b)
Baniarmasin Thermal Plant. The construction of the power plant will reqluire acquisition of 110 ha
of land. Altogether 36 families will need to be reseted. Public consultations have been held with
the affected families at both project sites with NGO participation. There is agreement on the positive
socio-economic impacts of the proposed project components, as well as on the action plans for
resettlement and compensation. The project is classified in the environmental category WA". The EA
reports for the major physical cow:ponents of the project have been prepared and their executive
summaries distributed to the Executive Directors on March 28, 1994. Complete EA reports are
available at the Bank's Public Information Center.
16.         Sustainability. The project is a part of PLN's least cost development plan. It has been
designed to met electricity demand growth in the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan and operate for
30-50 years. PLN has adequately trained staff, competent management and financial resources to
operate and maintain the proposed facilities efficiently.
17.        Implementation. The physical components of the project will be implemented by PLN,
which has appointed project managers for Besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power plant
components, as well as for the barge-mounted power plants. Engineering and construction supervision
will be provided by international consulting engineering firms with local associates in accordance with
time bound, computerized project schedules. Technical assistance for institution building will be
managed by the Bureau of Environment & Technology in MME for the improvement of environmental
management capabilities in the coal mining sector. The other technical assistance components will be
managed by PLN.

transmission and distribution investments;
(e)   take necessary measures, jointly with PLN, to reorganize PLN as a limited liability
company (Persero), and by December 31, 1994, furnish to the Bank the draft of a timn
bound corporate reorganization and restructuring plan of PLN; and



(f)   ensure that transfer of profits from PLN to the Overall Development Fund (DPS) shall
not prevent PLN from implementing its agreed investment programs.
19.         With PLN. PLN will:
(i)   achieve .n 8 percent rate of return for all its operations for fiscal years 1994/95 and
each year thereafter;
(b)   maintain and have periodically inspected the Besai dam in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank;
(c)   implement the environmental and resettlement ation plans agreed with the Bank;
(d)   operate the besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power plants in accordance
with the Environmental Guidelines agreed with the Bank, and the Indonesian national
standards;
(e)   not incur any additional debt unless a reasonable forecast of its net revenues after
expenditures for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred is at least 1.5
times its projected debt service requirements;
(f)   periodically review with the Bank the LRMC with a view to formulating its tariff
structure;
(g)   prepare a rolling ten-year financial forecast based on its proposed development plans
and review aœnually with the Bank PLN's investmen plan for the next five years;
(h)   annually revalue its fixed assets and accumulated depreciation, in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank.
20.         The Borrower has also agreed to fulfill the following conditions of effectiveness:
(a) Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Borrower and PLN satisfactory to the Bank;
and (b) taking all measures, satisfactory to the Bank, to ensure PLN's compliance with the covenanted
rate of return target in its fiscal year 1994.
21.         Benefits.  The proposed project is designed to support the implementation of a
comprehensive policy agenda in Indonesia's power sector and restructuring of PLN. The policy
actions being supported by the project will help open the sector to private investors and restructuring
of PLN will expand the financial envelope for system expansion and enhance incentives for lowering
the cost and improving the reliability of electricity service. In addition, the project will help PLN
meet increases in demand for electricity in Sumatera and Kalimantan with improved service reliability.
Technical assistance will help strengthen the environmental management capabilities of GOI and PLN.
As part of this program, the proposed project will serve as a model for the expansion of the power
subseator in the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan by setting up pilot projects in Regions IV and VI
respectively.
22.         Project Risks. While there may be slippage, there is little risk that the GOI will fail
to implement the power sector policy agenda in view of the Government's satisfactory implementation
record, and the continuing dialogue and cooperation between the Bank and the GOI. The technical
risks associatel with the Besai hydroelectric power plant and the Banjarmasin thermal plant are
minimal. The project management and implementation risks are contained by ensuring the
appointmeat of qualified civil works contractors for the main physical components and the use of
experienced international consultants for design and construction supervision, coupled with the
appointment of experienced project managers and time bound project implementation schedules, with
key milestone dates.
