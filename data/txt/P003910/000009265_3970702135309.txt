INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATIONS FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A 150 XV HIGH VOLTAGE
TRANSMISSION LINE BETWEEN MULUT TANEANG POWER PLANT
AND CEWPAXA AND TRISAXTI SUBSTATIONS
CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
I.1. Background
Electricity demand is very, high in Indonesia, and is
increasing. Within the past ten years, the average increase
has reached 15 t per year. Power Plants need to be built to
meet this demand. Usually, the location of the generating
plant can not be close to the center of the load area,
because the primary resources needed for the power station
(e.g. water power,  geothermal)  are not removable.   Also
secondary resources (such as cooling water for a steam
energy power plant) are not available anywhere else. For
these reasons transmission lineb are required to transmit
the electricity from the power plant to the load area.
The electricity demand for the State Electrical Company
Sub district VI in South Kalimantan is projected to reach
800 NW by the year bf 2015. To meet this demand, construc-
tion of a Steam Energy Electric Power Station with a GGO MW
capacity will begin in 1995. The Mulut Tambang Power Plant
will be located at Asam Asam, a town in Sub district Jorong,
Regency Tanah Laut.
In order to transmit the electricity from tilhe  ulut
Tambang Power Plant, a 150 XV high voltage transmission line
will be constructed. The line from the Mulut Tambang rower
Plant to the Cempaka Substation will be 75 km long and the
I- 1



line between Cempaka and the Trisakti Substation will be 43
km long.
X. 2. Legislation
Some legislation related to the Construction Planning
of the 150 XV High Voltage Transmission line between the
Mulut Tambang Power Plant and the Cempaka and Trisakti Relay
Stations are as follows :
1. Legislation No. 20/1961, concerning about revocation of
ownership right of Land and other properties in it.
2. Legislation No. 4/1982, about main regulations on tha
environmental management.
3. Legislation No. 15/1986, about power plants (electrical
energy).
4. The Government Regulation No. 34/1979, about electricity
exertion.
5. The Government Regulation No. 29/1986, about environmen-
tal impact assessment.
6. The Instruction of the President of the Republic of
Indonesia No. 9/1973, about implementation of the revoc.j
tion of ownership right of land and other properties in it.
7. The Minister of Internal Affair Regulation No. 15/1975,
concerning about Provisions of Land acquittal procedures.
8. The Decision of the Minister of Residential Affairs and
Environment No. 50/Men KLH/6/1987, about the Guide lines oi
Compilation of Environmental Impact Assessment, Enclosure I.
9. The Decision of the Minister of Hining and Energy tao.
0935/K/008/M, about technical guide lines for initial envi-
ronmental examination compilation for steam energy pcwer
plan project.
10. The Decision of the Minister of Residentiai Attairz ana
Environment No. 49/I4enKLH/6/1987,  about   Important Impact
I - 2



Determination Guide Lines and its Enclosures.
11. The Regulation of the Minister of Mining ana Energy No.
Ol/P/47/MPE/1992, concerning about the Minimum Free Distance
between High Voltage Transmission Conductor and the Ground
and other object.
1.3. Purposes and Objectives
The transmission line is 118 km long and will pass
through the Regency Banjarmasin, Administrative city Banjar
Baru, and Regency Tanah Laut. The transmission route will
pass through residential areas, rice fields, swamps etc.
which will possibly cause conflicts of interest between the
project and the areas.
Initial Environmental Examinations have been conducted
to prevent and to minimize the negative impacts. The objec-
tives of the studies are as follows :
1. To identify the activities of the Transmission Construc-
tion Planning Project, especially the ones which are likely
to cause environmental impacts.
2. To identify the base line environment prior to the pro-
ject, especially the areas where the transmission line is
planned.
3. To predict and evaluate the impact caused transmission
line construction.
4. To offer suggestions to manage and monitor the resulting
impact.
1.4. Utilization
These Initial Environmental Examinations lielp the
Project Initiators in the decision making, planning, and
management control of the project.  The Project Initiators
are the Department of Mining and Energy, the State Electri-
I - 3



cal Company (Main Project of South Kalimantan and a 150 KV
Network), as well as the Government of the South Kalimantan
Province.
I.5. Scope of the study
An important step in analyzing the Environmental impact
is to determine the scope of the study.
The scope of the study consists of
1. Determining the territorial boundary of the study area.
2. Determining the analyzed Environmental Components.
3. Analyzing the plan of activities which are likely to
cause impacts.
4. Conducting research and study of the base line environ-
ment.
5. Compiling a guide for environmental management and envi-
ronmental monitoring strategies.
I.S.1. Territorial Boundary of the Study Area
1. Project Boundary
The project area covers land which is directly under
the route of the transmission line.   The 118 km long path
includes villages in Municipal city Banjarmasin and Rcqcn-
cies Banjar and Tanah Laut (Fig. 1.1).
2. Ecological Boundary
This boundary is determined according to thc -cala and
the differant types of natural processcs. The determination
of the Ecological Boundary is based on the prominent .a.pucti-
of the activities of the Project which are likely to h.ac- "n
impact on the environment as well as the impact oL thu
environment on the transmission line.   The sprcad ot the
S- 4



impact is 50 meters to the left and to the right of the
transmission route (Figure I.2).
3. Administrative Boundary
This boundary concerns the social, economic, and cul-
tural activities of the Government.   It is also concerned
about particular public places where people, farmers, and
merchants  conduct 'their  activities.  Administratively  thc.
transmission line will pass through Municipal city 3anjarma-
sin and Regencies Banjar and Tanah Laut (Figurc 1.3).
4. Technical Boundary
This boundary is determined by the capability of the
technical study based on the limitation of the funds, time,
facilities,  and the availability of experts.   Also,  the
importance of science and technology in controlling, plan-
ning, and protecting the worker safety is to be considered.
1.5.2. The Environmental components Studied
There are three main Environmental Components witth
parameters to be analyzed for the study.  They will be u..c*d
to evaluate the impact of the project activities. The txzpl-
nation of each component is as follows:
I.5.2.1. Geophysical components
A. Climate
a. The important climate components include the type ot tne
climate, temperature (maximum, minimum, and average tempera-
ture), humidity, and precipitation.



B. Physiography and Geology
The physiographic and geological data that need to be
identified includes :
a. Topography, geomorphology, structural geology, and seis-
mic information of the transmission route,   and the sur-
rounding areas.
b. Geological condition of the rock and the soil.
c. Location and the width of dangerous areas, such as re-
gions of landslides, mass wasting, and floods.
d. The uniqueness of the morphology will be presented on a
map with sufficient scale (1:100,000 or as needed) for the
study.
C. Hydrology
a. High tide/Low tide.
D. Land and its use
a. Inventory of land use and other existing resources prior
to the project, and the planned use of the activity sitc_
and the surrounding areas afterward.
b. Conflict of interests between the project and the exizt-
ing users.
1.5.2.2. Biotic components
The Identification of the terrestrial and aquatic
natural resources will be based on - the secondary data or
direct measurements from the field. They include:
a. Identification of the habitats of the rare flora anel
fauna near the transmission line.
I - e.



b. Discussion of the natural and cultivated plant and animal
communities which exist in the plan activity site and sur-
rounding area.
S.5.2.3. Social economy, social culture, and public health:
The base line environment of social economy, social cul
ture, and public health at the planned activity site and the
surrounding areas include :
a. The population structure, including the number of the
population, the density, the gender proportion, the mobili-
ty, and the birth and mortality rates.
b. Education and religion.
c. Public health.
1.5.2.4. The planned activity impacts to be studied
The activity impacts to be studied in this project are
components which are likely to cause impacts before the
construction, during the construction, and after the con-
struction.
A. Pre Construction Phase
Land acquittal activities for the tower locations are
likely to cause negative impacts during this phase.  Land
speculation and changes in land ownership will cause social
unrest. Accurate and timely information will minimize this
problem.
B. Construction Phase
Impacts due to mobility of the workers, equipment, and
materials needed for the project, and the activities during
I - 7



the tower construction and wire stringing are to be ana-
lyzed. The need of workers for this project which increase
of the job opportunity,  is   a positive impact,  but the
limited skills of the job hunters, may lead to the existence
of some scalpers (mediators) in the job hunting.
C. Post Construction Phase
Impacts due to the high voltage electricity transmis-
sion during this time need to be studied.
1.6. METHODS OF STUDY
I.6.1. Data Collecting
To document the base line environment of the project
area, the use of secondary data is stressed. Primary data
collecting is done when secondary data is not available.
Appropriate data collecting method for each field of study
is used.
I.6.2.1. Primary Data Collecting
The primary data on the physical, biotic, social econo-
my, social culture, and public health are collected from the
field. The data collecting locations are determined based on

the result of the coverage.



a. Climate
Measurement and calculation of some secondary meteoro-
logical data such as temperature, wind direction and veloci-
ty, humidity, precipitation, pressure, and -rain intensity
are done to examine the climate of the research area.
b. Physiography and Geology
Examination of Physiography, geology, erosion, and the
change or the modification of land due to digging, filling
up or some quarrying is conducted using maps which are
available for the feasibility study. Regions which have a
big risk in erosion are illustrated on maps with appropriate
scale.
c. Farming and Food Ecology
Investigation on the farming is done by survey and
special study. Survey is used to examine the general condi-
tion of the farming system in the study area, whereau thce
special study is to examine detailed farming problems withir
the society, in relation to social-economy, social culturu,
and food ecology.
d. Land Use

e. Flora
This study is to examine the composition and the struc-
ture of the flora along the planned transmission route. The
study is done by registering the plant's types (aquatics or
terrestrial), and the number of the each individual plant.
It is also to examine plants which have special values (i.e.
plants. with high economical value, plants that can be used
for construction/building material, and plants that are very
typical for the area).
f. Fauna
The fauna examination is done using inventory,   inter-
view, catching, and trail tracking methods.
f. 1. Inventory
Faunal inventorying is done especially in the transmis-
sion planned site.   This is done by exploring somc arcas
which is expected to have a lot of fauna, such as residen-
tial areas. Faunal types and their habitats need to be
registered.
f. 2. Interview
An interview is done to the people living in the pro-
ject and surrounding areas to register some animals *-hich
are  overlooked  during the inventory  process. A complete
faunal data is expected.
g. Aspects of Social Culture - Social Economy, and Public
Health
Those aspects   are studied by interviewing some re-
spondents in the project area. The topic of the intervie.w
consists of custom or tradition, institution, art, soci4l
fidgety, and public health.

The plan of the project activities include
A. PRE CONSTRUCTION STEP
The Pre Construction activities include :
1. Field Survey
a. Topographic Survey
1). The plan of the transmission route is first
sketched on a topographic map of 1:50,000 scale.
2). The chosen route is evaluated based on the real
field condition.
3). The determination of the route is based on the
technical and economical aspects. The best route should
have optimum technical and economical aspects.
4). The measurement of horizontal distance, surface
elevation, contouring, and other features (i.e. roads,
irrigation networks, railroads) is done using theodolite.
Those measurements are then plotted on the profile map.
5). The profile map is made in accordance with the
design. This map should depict the condition of the tower
location and the land where the transmission         route is
located and the surrounding areas, including the names of
the towns, sub districts, regencies, the names of the land
owners, especially in the tower sites.
b. Soil Mechanic Survey
In general, this survey is conducted to examine the
soil condition, and the primary goals are :
1). To provide data needed for the plan of digging and
II - 4



burying.
2). To compile surface and soil condition data in the
tower sites.
3). To give suggestions about choosing the foundation
type that is best for that area, based on the
result of the soil mechanic data.
4). To provide important technical data to make the
budged estimagion easier.
The activities which are done in the soil mechanic
survey include
The activity done in the soil mechanic survey include

c.Tower Erection
During the constructing of the foundations and the
tower positioning, the extent of the land is planned to be
wide enough for the activities. Some materials is stored
in the storage in the base camp, and to be picked up/
delivered to the field whenever needed. Other materials,
such as corals, sand, etc. are to be bought at the closest
stores, tobe delivered to the constructing sites whenever
needed. Water and concrete mixer are from the constructing
sites and the surrounding areas. All of these activities
II - 9



are relatively short and to be done in different places,
at all of the tower sites.
Tower is erected on top of a foundation which has been
built earlier. A stub ( a place where the tower foot is
tied with moor - bolt connection) has been installed on
the foundation. This tower constitutes.of a profilc frame
(commonly called as lattice steel tower), arranged in such
way that each steel member has different dimension. This
tower constrtrcting method is manual, the equipments needed
for the constructing are tool sets crane, jin pole and
string. The route of the 150 KV high voltage transmission
line is 118 km long with an average span of 350 m. There
will be approximately 369 towers with the network route as
shown in Table II. 5.

The ground clearence is larger than in the developed
countries (which is only around 7.5 - 13.5 m), to give
higher safety level due to the low of the education ievel
of the people in the project area. Based on the PUXL 1987;
760 F, the distance between a high voltage transmission
conductor and an extra high voltage with the ground and
other objects, a 150 KV high transmission line should have
minimum clearpnce, so that the land along the transmission
route need to be acquitted. However, the regulation of the
Minister of Mining and Energy of February 7, 1992, No.
Ol.P/47/MPE/1992, and its enclosure says that the tower
can be heighten so that the land along the transmission
route does not need to be acquitted (Figures XX.6,
XX.7,XX.8,XX.9 and XX.10).
d. Stringing
Stringing is done starting from one section to the
others respectively. The locations are selected at the
tension tower. The location of the tension tower is in the
open and relatively wide areas. Four tensional conductor
drumps are arranged within this* area,  the end  of the
conductors are then connected with fishing wires. Those
fishing wires are pulled (manually by people) to the next
related section where the pulling machine   is located.
This pulling machine is then activated parallel with the
tension machine located at the drump sites. Coordination
of these works is done using a radio communication operat-
ed by operators from those two sites.

BASE LINE ENVIRONMENT
III. 1. Physical Environment Component
III. 1. 1. Climate
Climate  is presented  by  many  parameters,  including
temperature, humidity, cloud covering, wind direction and
velocity, and solar insulation.
In the project site, the average temperature during thc
day is around 27 to 29 °C. It some time reaches below or
above those numbers. The fluctuation of the temperature
during the days varies, it is below 3 OC most all the time,
but some time it reaches above 5 OC. The record shows that
in December 16, 1989, the fluctuation reached 10 OC.
During the nights the temperature is lower, around 23 -
26 0C, with stable fluctuation, lower than 3 °C.
The fluctuation of the temperature during the days is
mostly caused by cloud covering. Cloud covering of 1, 2, 3,
Octa causes the sunlight mostly bc radiated to cartlh, mq.&kc_
the heating more intensive. At nights, the cloud covering isz
bigger/ larger, around 5 to 7 Octa, and this causes lo-.
fluctuation on the night temperature.
Wind velocity is usually low, mostly und.r I -/ *..cond.
It gets faster some time, more than 1 m/ sec. BGt!t or nogrt:
or during the days the source of the wind directiGn seez to
be irregular. It is usually froz the cast (both. s-cuth ea-t
and north east)  and from north west and :zctk. .t     z    :t {_
Figure III. 1).
The humidity is generally high, from 70 -  g t ourfing
the days, and  o - 9  % at nights (Table- JX1. 3).

Table III. 2 shows that the dry season in Banjarmasin
occurs from May to October. However, in 1983 the precipita-
tion was still highl in May and Junc,  it. was us.. m,m  asnd
243.6 mm respectively. In May 1984 the it was relatively
high, 10.6 mm. At the dry season in 1974 to 1987, the record
of the lowest precipitation was in August 1981, it w..a only
10.3 mm; while the highest was in October 1976, 399.¶J mm.
The rainy season in Banjar Baru is from tiovembur t
April (Table III. 2). The lowest precipitation was in ipril
1983, 57.8 mm and the highest was 518.3 mm, in M.arch 1S7t0.
III. 1. 2. Physiography and Geology
A. Physiography
The transmission route which starts fron Mulut r.3r.al,jI
Power Station and ends at Relay Station Trinak.ti a_ rorc or
less parallel to high ways. Those route generally  .
through plain or undulated areas. The plain areas uS&.22
consist of swamps, or plain areas covered witn tall rjrse_
and bushes.  The undulated mountains consi-t  of _
areas covered with tall grasses and busnce, ar.d _ose- areas
which  are being  developed  to be sugar  cdr.U  ,
especially around Pelaihari City (Figure III. 2j.
From Asar-AsaD to Jorong, the trarisZiZic,. r       --

mission lina will pass over plain or swamp areas and soma
undulated lowland.
B. Geology
From Asam-Asam to Jorong, the transmission routo will
pass over swamp deposits which consist of loose gravel,
sand, silt, and clay. Red sandstone of the Upper part of
Dahor Formation is some time exposed in some places. From
Jorong to Pelaihari, the lithology consist of sedimentary
rocks of Dahor Formation (Tertiary). In the soutlh of Ptelai-
hari, the route will pass through weathered Mesozoic Meta-
morphic Rocks. In Cempaka, this line in general will pass
through Quaternary deposits overlying the Tertiary Red
Sandstone.  From  Cempaka to Trisakti,  it will cross :.wainp
deposits which consist of loose gravel, sand, silt, and cl.y
(Figure II:. 3).
III. 1. 3. Hydrology
The transmission route will pasz through man! bLg .antJ
small rivers. Asam-Asam and Martapura river-  ir%. ttt:  ,4.1i
streams which will be crossed by the route. Other _nmt.1
rivers are Sawangan, Tabanio, and Banyuhir4n.
Asam-Asam river is  -. ose to the Mulut T.ik.bnc  Paowr
Station location. It flows from the north to the SCutth. tG
the Java  Sea.  The maximum discharge down  strcan  (arftr
crossing with the bridge) is 54.4 n3/  iecon, wh*:Lu t':s
minimum discharge is 0,90 s 3/ second. Uc_zide iLtt   Lj  ^
people's daily lives, the river is alsc u_cd ac:

Martapura river crosses the Municipality City Banjarma-
sin near - the Relay Station Trisakti. This river flows to
Barito river near Banjarmasin City.
In general, the low and high tide in the Martapura
river is affected by the low and high tide of Barito river.

11I.1.4. Soil
Based  on  the  available  soil.  m&p  of   I                      LOO,000  :.c.L%.
regionally South Kalimantan is composed of   = _oil =4p. UnLt_
I1I.] -:



(SMU); which include soil map units Organosol gicihumus,
Alluvial, Latosol, Yellowish red Podzolic complex, Laterit-
ic, and Podzol (Fig. I11.4).
In the southern and western parts of South Kalimantan
Province, parallel to the coast, Alluvial SMU is distribut-
ed. This unit covers the coastal and fluvial plains, with an
elevation between 1 - 15 m above sea level. The ground water
surface is generally low, these areas is even flooded peri-
odically, or permanently in some places. The alluvial unit
includes many different kind of soils, namely Glei Humic,
Glei Histic, alluvial, and Regosol. The alluvial is origi-
nated from a parent rock which consists of dusty to sandy
clay alluvium with an organic rich top horizon, where as the
regosol is developed from loose coarse coastal sand.
The Glei Humic and Glei Histic soils are hydromorphic,
rich in organic material, and occ'ipy low depth areas. Thc
Glei soil spreads on areas with bad drainage system, espe-
cially along the Java coast (flooded coastal swamps), the
flooded areas of Kintap and Asam-Asam rivers and their
distributaries, and southern part of Banjarmasin. The alluv-
ial covers especially along river banks, consists of rcla-

Yellowish red  Podzolic and Lateritic soil map  units

The soils in the research area especially in  the dry
land (up land) are very acidic, dominated by  low activity
clay with low Cation Exchange Capability (CEC), low  basic
saturation,  high Al  exchange  capability.  l'his is due to
the intensive process of the parent rock weathering and the
nutrient leaching which have gone on for relatively lonej
time, controlled by humid climate, high rate of hydrocarbon
accumulation (2,755 mm/year), and the high number of rain;
days (190 days/year), with 2-3 dry months/ year. 7hc 5oi1 in
the research area especially in the dry land soil; l'toza!

system improvement may be able to induce to de crease the
soil pH and increase the Al availability.
In detail, the main constraint of the soil in the
research area is as follows : the upland (convex areas), the
yellowish red podzolic soil, has medium : high Al saturation
which is poisonous to cultivated plants. The low-land soil,
podzolic glei or greyish yellow podzolic and gleisol umbric
(glei humic) have a very low ground water surface (less than
50 cm). Those constraint are the main restrictions for
cultivating hard plants. The stagnant surface water (swamps)
and the reductive soil is the main constraint for cultivat-
ing dry land plants in the gleisol histic soil.
The soil in the research area are still potential for
cultivating one season, low rooted plants, because the top
soil are still contain organic matter (with medium concen-
tration) Nitrogen, especially when white washing is done.
However, a lot of chalk may be needed to increase the land
productivity , due to the low pH and the high buffering
capacity of the soil.
III.1.S. Land Uses
The comprehensive diagram of the land use of the areas
along the transmission route from Asam-asam to the Trisakti
is shown in Figure III.S. Between Asam-asam and Pelaihari,
the route generally passes through tall grasses meadow,
plantation, rice field, and some forests. Jorong area simi-
lar to Asam- asam, the route passes over plantations, some
rice field, vllages, and some forests. Closer to Pelaihari,
beside rice field and villages, the route passes through
sugar cane, rubber and other plantations.
Between Pelaihari and Cempaka, the route are covered by
sugar cane, rubber, rice fields, other plantations, somc
villages and dry field (not irrigated field). Between Ccmpa-

ka and Trisakti the route will pas through tall grasses
meadow, dry field and iron wood field areas. A lot of rice
field is found in Kayubawang and Banyuhanyar area, whereas
areas between Banjarmasin city and Trisakti is generally
villages. Only a small part of them are tall grasscs mead-
ows and dry fields.
111.2. Biotic Component
111.2.1. Flora
Based on the vegetation covering, there are 5 different
kind of plant formations along the transmission route,
namely cultivated plant, secondary forest, open vegetation,
swamp, and mangrove forest.

The table shows that the population of tho adult is
bigger than children population. It means that tho numiber or
working generation in the research area is big.
b. Peopla Mobility
Mobilitylpf the people is determined by the number of
people come and  the number people leave the particular
area. The mobility of the people in the research area is
shown in Table 111.7.

Table 111.7 shows that the number of people that come
is bigger than the people that leave. This is because some
parts of certain sub district are transmigran destination,
so that the population always increases.
c. Mortality and Birth Rate
The birth and mortality rates also affect the popula-
tion size. The birth and mortality rates are calculated
every year. The following table presents the birth and
mortality rates   of sub districts in the researcn- drCaa
(Table 111.8).

The table shows that the birth rate is a lot higher
than the mortality rate. This may be caused by two possibil-
ities, first, family planning program is not success in this
area, second, their health awareness is high that they are
in a good health.

Table IXI.9 shows that every sub district has schools,
from elementary to high school. The number of elementary
schools in each sub district has met the need of the sub
district, even if they are not spreid evenly. The number of
Junior high schools is still too small compare to the ele-
mentary school graduates, who need to continue their study.
Five of the sub districts in the research areas has only one
high school each, while the others have had enough high
schools.
b. Religion
People in the research area along the transmission
route are generally Moslem, some of them are Christians and
Chatolics. Only few of them are Hindus and Buddhist (Table
III.10).

suspected, diagnosed as malaria.
The examination result on malaria to transmigrans in,
some transitoes in South Kalimantan in 1991-1992 shows tlhaL
some transmigrans were contracted malari,a at their  original
place before they came to South Kalimantin. It proves that
malaria is carried by transmigrans to South Kalimantan.

The number of people suffering from diarrhea is very
high in Tanah Laut Regency. They are 3451, two of them died
(Table 111.14.). Even though the fatality,rate is relatively
low, we still need to concern about the XLB diarrhea, since
it may be related to environ mental hygieniety and sanita-
I
tion in South Kalimantan.

CHAPTER IV
ESTIATXION AND EVALUATXON OF THE
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
IV.31. Environmental Impact Identification
An impact identification flow chart (see appendix 1)
can be drawn based on the interaction between the project
activities and the environment.   This area includes a 50
meter distance to the right and left of the route.
The estimation and evaluation on the important expected
impacts can be seen in Appendix 2.
IV.2. Impact Estimation and Evaluation
IV.2.1. The Environment impact to the Project
IV.2.1.a. Physical
Some of the areas along the transmission route, such as
in Asam-asam and Sub district Gambut - Banjarmasin, are
composed of swamps. This makes the tower foundation con-
struction and cable stringing difficult.
The municipality city Banjarmasin, from T 100 to Tri-
sakti Relay Station, is mainly a residential area with a
relatively dense population. This will likely cause problems
in the land acquittal. There will be two towers located in
this area.
V.2.1.b. social - Economy
The dense populated area (Municipality city Banjarma-
IV - 1



sin) does not seem to support the transmission route.
The swamp areas along the transmission route may pro-
vide breeding places for mosquitoes, which can endanger the
project workers.
IV.2.2. The Impact for the Project to the Environment
IV.2.2.1. Pro Construction
IV.2.2.l.l. Field Survey
Field surveys show that outside the municipality city
Banjarmasin,   Relay Station Asam-asam does not cause any
negative impact, because people seem to be able to accept
the project.  Social unrest is likely to occur in a highly
populated area such as municipality city Banjarmasin.  The
residents are concerned that the compensation for the land
and buildings may be lower than what was determined by the
Government. This will cause large negative impacts.
IV.2.2.1.2. Information
Information about the construction plan is planned to
be given to the people living in the project and surrounding
areas before the land acquittal. This should be done in a
such way to make sure that they understand that the trans-
mission line is technically safe, that only the land which
is needed for the tower locations is acquitted, and that the
owners of the land will be getting compensation. They also
need to know that the compensation will be given fairly,
according to the prevailing regulations.
This information is expected to help people understand
more about the project, which should also reduce the social
IV - 2



unrest.    Information sure will give a long term, very
important, positive impact to the project.
IV.2.2.1.3. Land Acquittal of the Location of the Tower Site
a. society perception
The Minister of Mining and Energy Regulation no. 1
P/MPE/1992, explains that the land to be acquitted and to
be compensated for is an area where the towers are located.
It can include houses and buildings, with the width of 29.5
x 29.5 m2 to 33.5 x 33.5 m2, depending on the tower type.
There will be 368 towers (225 of Aa type, 16 of Bb
type, 7 of Cc type, and 8 of Dd type)   built along the
transmission line from Asam asam Power Station to Relay
Station Cempaka.   112 towers which consist of 100 Aa type,
7 Bb type, 2 Cc type, and 3 Dd type will be constructed
along the transmission line from Relay Station Cempaka to
Relay Station Trisakti.
There are 6 houses standing on the land where three
towers are to be located (Table IV. 1). The acquittal will
cause negative impacts if the given compensation is lower
than the local standard price.

b. Social Unrest
The land acquittal activities will cause social unrest
among the people living in the project and surrounding
areas, especially if the people do not understand the that
the transmission line is not dangerous.    The land to bz
acquitted is only the land where the towers will be located,
and it is relatively small. This may cause important nega-
tive impacts.
IV.2.2.2. Construction
IV. 2. 2. 2. 1. Worker Mobility
a. Job opportunity
This project will need 179 workers,   120 of them un-
skilled laborers. This will provide job opportunities for
the people in the project area. This also means a decrease
in unemployment. This positive impact may not be important
since the project will be done within a very short time.
b. Income
Those job opportunities will increase people's income.
This positive impact may not be very significant, since the
project will only be done in a very short time.
IV.2.2.2.2. Equipment and Material Xobility
a. Road and transportation means
Heavy equipment and material mobilization will dciamac
roads, especially the small town roads. Patch roads need to
Iv -;



be built since there are no roads to the tower sites.  The
land is generally not productive, therefore the negative
impact will be small.
b. Traffic
The activities in mobilizing the equipment and materi-
als for the project will certainly damage the roads and
disturb the traffic, especially in Banjarmasin.  This will
cause negative impacts, but   since these activities will
only occur in a very short time, the impacts may not be
significant.
IV. 2.2.2.3. Tower erection
a. Land use
The total land that needs to be acquitted for the tower
sites consists of:
- 0.14 hectares of residential areas
- 8.28 hectares of rice field
- 3.58 hectares of plantation
- 0.28 hectares of dry field
- 15.3 hectares of bushes and scrubs
- 4.0 hectares of tall grass meadow
- 0.57 hectares of swamps.
The complete data on the land use in the project area
can be seen in Table Iv.l
Those lands will have different usage and will Affect
the people in those areas wihen the project is co=pleted*
However, since the land which will be occupied by the tcwers
is relatively narrow, and only along the trans_iusion line,
the negative impacts may not be significant.

There are only a few types and populations of plants

IV.2.2.2.4. Instolation Transmision
a. Land
This activity Istelation Transmision will damages
plants and people's land, therefore this will make negative
impacts.
However the duration of this activity is take short time
relatively to finish the activity at each tower and the
problem my be solved by give conpensation for the damages
plants. The impact may not very significant.
b. Traffic
This activity will disturb the traffic activity espe-
cially in down town (Kota Madya Bnjarmasin). But due to this
activity is take short time the impact will be very s=al!1.
IV.2.2.3. Pasca Construction
IV.2.2.3.1. Electric Energy Transmission
a. Society Restness
Generally, the impact of transmission line to environr-
ment in the pasca-construction is not so important princip-
ally. However, because the durarion of electricity power
IV - 7



distribution takes along time, and people's perception on
magnetic area and electricity are quite low, therefore there
is a need to give an alectricity extension, especially in
the crowded area to slow down society restness.
technically, electricity power distreibution using SUTT
150 KV transmission from PLTU Mine Mouth to Cempaka Substa-
tion until Trisakti Substation will give some impacts as
follow :
1). There will be a corona symptomp along the SUTT 150 KV
transmission line, and it will cause
- Radio Interference or RI
- Television Interference or TVI
- Audible Noise or AN
2). Electrostatic Induction along the transmission line.
Below, there is an illustration about Corona Effect
that needs to bear in mind
Corona Effect
When SUTT 150 XV transmission line is working, then in
that line will be appear a corona effect because of ioniza-
tion on the air. Corona looks like a violet light around the
wire with a hissing voice and its smell is like an ozon.
Corona can make some effects as below:
(1.1) Radio Interference (RI)
RI will affect areas along transmission line, mainly to
radio AM receiver. Based on transmission configuration, then
the result of RI calculation to SUTT 150 KV transmission
that will be built is shown in the table below:

TVI threshold in 20 metres distance from transmission
line is the same as RI in point one above. therefore the
television receiver radio under SUTT' 150 XV transmission
line with 16 metres clearance will have no trouble both in a
good wheather and in a bad wheather.
(1.3). Audible Noise (AN)!
AN in the transmission line is happened due to the
spreading of corona, and it can be calculated and presented
in the table below:

Based on Perry Criteria from Bonneville Power admihis-
tration (BPA) that AN threshold is less than 52.5 db. There-
fore, AN in the SUTT 150 KV transmission line with 16 metre
clearance will have no impact at all.
(2). Electrosta;tic Induction Effect
Electrostatic Induction Effect of high voltage trans-
mission line is caused by its high voltage and its electro-
magnetic power inside the line. Electrostatic induction can
be calculated and presented in table below:
Table IV.5. Electrostatic Induction Effects
| Distance from    Electrostatic Induction
| Transmission   J (Kv/metre)                I

10       I    2.64

American's BPA decisioned its threshold as follow:
a.Human 9 KY/m
b.Animals 30 KV/n
c.Plants 20 Xv/m
Therefore, electrostatic induction under SUTT 150 KV
IV - 11



transmission line with minimum clearance 16 metre will still
be safed for human life.
However, its social impact to human is quite great,
because generally people do not want cultivate their land
which lay right under transmission line. If the transmission
line is quite low, then the impact will ba quito important.
People who live right under transmission line will feel
unhappy, because they think that may be they can get some
dangerous because of that transmission line, eventhough
according to the table above there,will be no impact at all.
Therefore, society restness is very important, mainly in the
crowded population, for example in the Banjarmasin City
Centre. Because the number of housings that passed by trans-
mission line    are small relatively compare to the whole
population, therefore the impact is important enough.
b. Income
This transmission of the electric energy will increase
the energy in subdistrict VI and will be used widely by a
lot of people. This   effect will be act for a long timc
during the operation time of the Power Station (around 30
years), so that the impact is important.
IV. 2.3. The Impact Handling
a. Social unrest
Social unrest due to the activities oi iuld ci urvvy,
land acquittal,  and the electricity  transmitting  can rz
decrease by giving intensive and efficient information to
the people living in the project area.
It will be better if the information is given a- early
as possible, by formaly inviting the people to come to tza
village meeting hall to listen to given inforaratior, ot by
informally visiting them in their houses,    especialzly In
the transmission route.
Heeded to be explained during the inforration that trne

land to be acquitted is only the land where the towers are
located. This is based on the Regulation of the Minister of
Mining and Energy No. 1 P/47/MPE/1922. It is also oxpoctod
that the compensation is big  enough to buy land or build-
ings in other place similar the ones their owned (based on
the Regulation of the Minister of Internal Affair No. 15, in
the year of 1975).
The society need to be informed that the high voltage
transmission line will not   disturb lifes under or around
it. They need to understand that their lives will still be
safe.
b. Worker problem
It is suggested that the the project will employed
local people to do its activities, especially for unskilled
labor.
c. Traffic jam
Traffic jam will likely to occur because the project
activities (i.e. equipment and material -mobility, tower
erection, and stringing). Previous traffic arrangements is
needed to avoid this situation.
