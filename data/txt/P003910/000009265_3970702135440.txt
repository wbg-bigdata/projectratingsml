1- ; Background
{a)  Summary of the Project, and the need for land acquisition.
In order to fulfill the increasing demand of electric energy in the area of
Lampung Province in particular and Sumatera, which the Besal
hydroelectric Power Project will be built According to the demand
forecast that area in 1996 wilt need a power production of 2,894 GWh
and an installed capacity of 722 MW, while the Besai HPP will have a
capacity of 90 MW with a total annual energy output of 396 GWh.
The Besai hydroelectric Power Project will be built as a run-off-river
power plant. A gated concrete weir of 13.3 m high will be built in the
Besai river. The headrace will be a tunnel of 4.3 m in diameterand
4.893 m lengths. The powerhouse will be surface type with two units
of turbine and generator of 53 MW each. The water of the river will be
temporarily stored in the daily poundage of 101 Ha. The average firms
discharge of the river is 24.3rn3/sec, while the generation discharge will
be 45.6 m31sec.
The location of project construction activities will be at Sukapura and
Dwikora Village, while the inundation will cover the Sukapura and Way
Petai Village. Administratively the Sukapura and Way Petai Village
belong to the Subdistrict of Sumber Jaya, District of North Lampung,
while Dwikora Village belong to the Bukit Kemuning Sub District, North
Lampung District.
The Prolect will affect the following landuses and structures. i.e.
-    The forest area used for part of the quarry and part of the access
road;
-    The forest area for the underground tunnel from the intake dam
to the power house with a length of 4,893 m;
-    The plantation and bushes in the dam location and access road;
-    Bridges in the 'Village of Sukapura and Wai Petai in the proposed
location of inundation area (3 suspension bridges and 1
semi-permanent bridge);
-    Part of the homegarden in part of the acc-ss road in Sukapura;
-    Several ricefield will be used as an inundation area.

w will not be compensated because no PAPs is using it
(b)    The. Project Affected People (PAP)
A total of 129 families will be affected by the Besai Project, comprising
88 families affected by the inundation area and 41 families affected by
the  construction  area. The  latter may  be  categorized  as  mforest
encroachers" having illegally planted coffee trees, Without legal
permission, on land belonging to the Forestry Agency.
None of the affected families will require physical relocation since their
residences (houses) will not be affected. They will, however, require
economic rehabilitation since their productive land, which is used for
cultivation of wet rice, dry rice and trees, will acquire under the project.
Land acquisition and payment of compensation has already been
completed for 31 of the 41 families in the construction area. However,
the land is still being, and will continue to be, cultivated by the former
2



users until it is required for construction.
From a survey carried out by PLN in the area in April 1993 appears that
approximately 85% of the population in the area have elementary school
education or less.
For details of affected families, see ANNEX 3
(cl   Objectives of this Plan and Commitments of PLN
The objectives of this plan are:
Mii  to ensure that PAPs are compensated for any losses of land,
vegetation and crops and buildings and structures.
(ii)  to ensure that the income level and the living standard of the PAP
shall not be reduced, but rather improved.
To achieve this objective PLN is committed to do the following:
to ensure that all PAPs, both landowners, formally owners and
"land encroachers", and non-landowners are compensated at
replacement value for all assets.
.1
to ensure that for land compensation, if any, will be completed
before the start of actual construction work;
to ensure that counselling, technical assistance and credit
facilities will be made available to those wishing to engage in
small business and other trade activities;
to ensure that education and training will be provided in
vocational training school if desired by the affected people.
2.      .  Policies of Comoensation
(a)   Cash Compensation and entitlements as per Land Acquisition legislation.
Land acquisition is implemented pursuant to KEPPRES (Presidential
Decree) No. 55/1993 with the establishment of the Committee of Land
Acquisition for Public Uses, commonly known as the Land Compensation
Committee. The amount of the compensation for land and plants will
basically follow the NJOP (the assessed value for tax purposes), but the
final price will be decided during consultation between the Land
Compensation Committee and the project affected population, and will
reflect replacement value. The people who have adat (traditional) land
as well as tanah negara (forestry land) will receive the full amount of the
3



land price.
-The land compensation procedure is as follows:
*
,.4i)   Public Consultation with the project affected people will be
conducted by the project proponent and the Land Compensation
Committee to give all necessary information about the project and
all related matters.
(ii)  The next step is the stacking out of the boundaries of the needed
land conducted by the project proponent.
tiii)  Then follows the detailed mapping oi the land holdings conducted
by the Land Compensation Committee.
(iv)  After the completion of maps, the inventory of crops, vegetation,
buildings and other assats will be conducted by the Land
Compensation Committee.
(v)  The next step is for the Land Compensation Committee to prepare
the list of the acreage of the land holdings and temporary
structures, and the volume of the affected crops.
(vi)  The final step will be the payment of the compensation directly to
the land owners through the local bank, based on the negotiated
prices agreed between the Land Compensation Committee, the
project proponent and the project affected people. If necessary,
PLN will assist affected people in opening bank accounts for this
purpose.
(b)   Optional land compensation entitlements:
(ii   Optional land for land comoensation
According to the negotiations already conducted between the
Land Compensation Committee and the PAP, nobody has opted
for 'land- for-land" compensation. Everyone would prefer to
arrange such purchase, if any, by themselves. However PLN is
ready to arrange the land-for-land compensation through the Land
Compensation Committee should such request arise. In case
suitable and acceptable land cannot be found before it is required
for  construction,  PLN   will  provide  for  adequate
transition/compensation allowance.
(ii)  ootional transmigration
The Provincial Government of Lampung through the Ministry of
4



Transmigration and Resettlement of Forest Encroachers has a
resettlement program for 2000 families per year.
The Project Affected People of the forest encroacher category will
be encouraged to join the national transmigration scheme. The
implementation will be the Ministry of Transmigration and the
Resettlement of Forest Encroachers in coordination with the
Resettlement Implementation Team.
{c)  Assistance for Rehabilitation of PAP
In order to assist the PAPs, who choose to remain in the
community, and the community as a whole, drafting of a
Rehabilitation Plan has commenced in consultation with PAPs and
other people from the Besai communities, NGO WATALA and
PLN. The Plan covers a period of six years, up to one year beyond
the time when the Power Project becomes fully operational. It is
designed as a development plan, based on a range of activities
which will assist people in the community to understand their
current socio-economic situation, the changes that the Project will
cause, and work towards identifying skills and support necessary
for them to maintain and improve their income and general
welfare. Given the high proportion of the people in community
that will be affected bA the Project, and in order to avoid envy of
non-PAPs, it is important that the activities are integrated into
plans for the community as a whole. This Plan is directed to assist
the PAPs in their rehabilitation, but will not exclude members of
the community to benefit from the activities. The plan will be
claborated in Chapter 4. The plan includes, inter alia:
{i)  training
PAPs are encourages to improve income possibilities by learning
new productive skills. Training in vocational training schools will
be made available to the PAPs. This effort will facilitate the
restoration of their income level. The formal vocational training
will take place at Industrial and Agricultural Training Centers
organized by the Mlnistry of Manpower, in coordination with the
Rehabilitation Management Group.
(ii) iobs/emolovment
Priority will be given to the PAP and the local people in general,
with the necessary skill and/or educational qualifications, for
employment by the project, involving the following principle
parties:
S



a.   PLN (Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara), which is
devided into PLN Besai Project, responsible for
construction and PLN Besai Sector, responsible for
operation of the plant.
b.   Construction and Supply Contractors of Besal
.Project and Sector.
All of the Besai project works will be entrusted to cortractors.
The contractors and their sub-contractors for civil, electrical and
mechanical er:gineering works will require the services of a large
number of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labors. Positions will
be made available to PAPs on a preferential basis. The estimated
number of unskilled laborers needed for civil works alone, during
the construction phase, expected to continue up to mid 1999, Is
well above 1000.
PLN Besai Sector will require the services of contractors and
suppliers to carry out the Operation and Maintenance activities.
Priority will be given to employment of PAPs to meet the need for
unskilled labor, to do routine tasks, with a minimum of training.
It is estimated that the number of such long term positions will be
between 50 to 100.
(iii)  credit       .
PLN will ensure that funds for-start-up credit for small business
and trading will be available for PAPs in connection with the
rehabilitation program.
(iv)  Information. counselling and technical assistance
PLN will ensure that the PAP will receive appropriate counselling
and technical assistance, if they select to invest land
compensation money in trading or small business.
3.         Institutional/Organisational responsibilities
(a)   Structure of implementation, and involved groups

4.        Plan of imolementation
(a). Land Acquisition and Land Cornpensation
The implementation of the land compensation procedure will be-
canducted in twn major stages, one of which has already been
completed. 31 "forest encroaching" families were compensated in
February 1994, when the project acquired land for Access roads, Intake
Dam, Surge Tank and temporary buildings for the project. However most
of the land is still can be utilized by the original users, as long as the
project does not require it. The next major land acquisition is scheduled
to take place in July, when land acquisition and compensation for power
house, spoil bank and the inundated area is scheduled to take place.
The land compensation schedule is as shown in Annex 1.
(b)  Rehabilitation of PAP
The Rehabilitation Plan is based on completing the following activities,
broadly within the proposed schedule. This is outlined below and
discussed more fully in the following section:
9



t.   Appointment of PLN Deve(opment Officer (May 1994)
2.   Establishment of Implementation Management Group (May 1994)
3.   Form Implementation Unit (June 1994)
,1 n4.   Community Information and Education (July-August 1994)
5.   Community Development Facilitator Training (July 1994)
6.   Form Community Groups (August-September 1994)
7.   Training Programs (October 1994 - April 1995)
8.   Program Implementation (Commencing May 1995)               A
9.   Evaluation (end 1995 and then every 6 months)
10.  Monitoring Principles.
The first three activities have been described in the previous chapter, the
remaining will be outlined below:
Activity 4. Community Information and Education (July - August
1994)
The objective is to create and maintain community awareness of:
1.   What is happening with the project overall;  s
2.   What are the possible forms of assistance;
3.   Progress with the Rehabilitation and Development Plan; and
4.   Stimulate active community-wide participation in the
development prdcess.
An important part this phase is to inform PAPs of possible
assistance through the agencies represented in the Resettlement
Implementation Team, including investment advise for use of land
compensation money.
A tentative list of -suggested option for the Project Affected
People is. presented below:
a).  to purchase other agricultural land
With the land compensation money the Project Affected People
may choose to buy agricultural land in other locations.
Alternatively PLN will arrange for the PAP the purchase of the
agricultural land, equivalent fin terms of output and quality) to the
project affected land, subject to the PAP's concurrence. PAP will
be encouraged to identify alternative land for themselves, within
a given geographic area, for purchase and immediate transfer by
PLN.
10



b).  Trading and small business                         j
The people may use their land compensation money as capital for
starting small businesses, such as:
->  *    Trade in agricultural commodity abundant In the project    i
area such as coffee beans and other seasonal crops.    V
v    Open small shop
*    Open small restaurant
*    Workshop
*    Tailors
t  *    Home industry such as: handicraft, processing of coffee
beans and other agricultural produce.
*                         §    Catering.
Animal husbandry: Chicken, goat, sheep, dairy cow.
PLN will ensure that the PAP will get appropriate counselling, and
access to credit for the selected options.
The consultadion and information process has already started.and
shall constitute a major activity until land has actually been taken
possession of by the project.
Activity 5. Community Development Facilitator Training (July 1994)
The objective is to develop a range of community-based skills for
advocacy and planning.
This will be a brief, intensive Trainer-training program to generate
informed representation of general community development
principles and practice throughout the community. As a result,
facilitator should be in a position to undertake internal community
liaison vital to forming community groups, which constitutes the.
next activity.
The scope of the Rehabilitation Plan will allow participation by all
people directly and indirectly affected by the project: landowners,
women, young people and forest encroacher. Participation will
not be enforced, and will be determined by community members
themselves. However, special access will be offered to those in
lower socio-economic groups.
The level of community participation at this stage is likely to be
dependent upon the successful implementation of the Community
Information and Education activities.
11



Activity 6. Form Community Groups (August-September 1994)   -- -
Consult with the community in small, functional groups to identify
and clarify
a.   comrnmon and individual livelihood problems
b.   community  perceptions about training and income
opportunities
c.  identify specific needs for financial support
d.   formulate suitable training and credit programs
Initially, groups will be formed according to:
occupation (e.g. rice farmers, dry land farmers) and/or
social groups (e.g. women, young people)
Later in the process, members will be regrouped according to the
specific skills-training workshop program they wish to follow to
formulate:
specific needs for training curricula and work experience
desired outcomes from courses (i.e. implementation plans)
The Implementation UJnit and The Rehabilitation Management
Group shall, based on this activity formulate implementation plans
together with the community to-be submitted to the Resettlement
Implementation Team for approval.
Activity 7. Training Programs (October 1994-April 1995)
In addition to. the training offered to PAPs at established
vocational training centers an appropriate training and skill-
development courses for the community will be developed before
September 1994, using hands-on, practically-orientated training
methods, including follow-up training for managing new
enterprises.
Below are list of training and skills development received from the
community on April 5, 1994.
Farmers:
1.   Livestock Breeding and management - poultry, goats,
ducks
*               2.   Plantation Management
12



Alternative cultivation systems (e.g. soil conservation);
Corp diversification (e.g. vanilla);
Agroforestry; and
Small-scale agribusiness.
3.   Fish Breeding
Intensification program for existing ponds;
Creation of new fish farming facilities
4.   Farm Management and Marketing
Cooperative management system
5.   Environmental preservation and soil conservation
Women
1.   Home industry/income generation (e.g. flower cultivation,
livestock, handicrafts); and.
2.   Small business management and marketing
Youth
Skill training workshops - suitable for employment in the
community and elsewhere.
Non Landowners
1.   Income-generation schemes
2.   Retraining programs - non-agricultural
To be effective in the long-term, the selection of particular
courses and participants will be actively integrated into the
community consultative process (activity 4).
Workshop and training courses will be provided (as far as
possible) within the village itself, so as to minimize disruption to
on-going life and work. Young people may, as mentioned above,
wish to undertake technical course at a Technical Training Center.
Activity 8. Community Development Program - Implementation (to
start May 1995)
Implement the overall Community Development Program and to
initiate progress toward community self-management. In doing
this the following milestone need to be considered.
1.   Establish community groups for project self-appraisal and
self-management;
2.   Develop mechanism for providing a range of technical
assistance programs;
3.   Establish low-cost, rotating credit facilities for new income
13



generating activities                                  l
A crucial element will be the access to low credit facilities,
providing small-scale credit for starting or expanding income-
generating activities. The formulation of procedures and criteria
for credit provision, savings and repayment, identification of
suitable local financial intermediaries, and opening of bank
accounts will be responsibility of the Rehabilitation Management
Group.
The Resettlement and Rehabilitation implementation schedule is shown
in Annex 2.
5.   Monitoring, reporting and Darticioatory evaluaion
Monitoring of the resettlement and land compensation processes and their
impacts will be carried out by an independent agency, e.g. local university in
cooperation with local Non Government Organization INGO).
A monitoring plan, with indicators for monitoring each activity and the progress
of project affected households will be designed by the independent agency,
selected to carry out the monitoring. This will be submitted to the World Bank
for approval before September 1994.
J
Quarterly Progress Reports, covering the project as a whole, to be submitted
to the World Bank, will include up-dates on land acquisition and resettlement
issues, such is rates of compenlsation, number of families affected, area
acquired, problems encountered. Specific Rehabilitation Progress Report will be
made twice a year, following the plan periods, during the construction stage
(5 years) till two years after the completion of the project. PLN shall submit the
monitoring reports to the World Bank in Washington DC with a copy to the
