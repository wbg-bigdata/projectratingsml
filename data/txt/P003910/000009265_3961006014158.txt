SUMATEtA AND KALM[ANTAN POWER PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECr SUMMARY
Borrower:    Republic of Indonesia
Benefidary:   State Electricity Corporation (PLN)
Amount:       US$260.5 million equivalent
Terms:        Repayable in 20 yea s, ii.cluding five years of grace at the standard variable
interest rate
Onlending     The proceeds of the loan, except $3.2 million for technical assistance to the
Terms:        Government of Indonesia (GOI), will be onlent from GOI to PLN for 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years; the subsidiary loan will be denominated in
US dollars and the onlending interest rate would be equal to the Bank's standard
variable interest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. PLN will bear the foreigr
exchange risk.
Project       The proposed project has a policy component and several physical components.
Description:  The policy component of the project entails: (a) establishing a policy framework
for private sector participation; (b) restructuring PLN and establishing
commercial operations as i limited liability company (Persero); (c) implementing
frmework for regulatory oversight of the power sector; and (d) introducing
formula-based power tariffs, as well as bulk power purchase and supply tariffs.
The physical components of the project would help finance economical and
enviromnentally sustainable expansion of PLN's generation capacity, with
associated transmission lines, in the islands of Sumiatera and Kalimantan and
improve  service reliability.   The physical project components are:
(a) construction of a hydroelectric power plant with an initial generating capacity
of 90 MW at Besai in South Sumatera and related transmission facilities;
(1) construction of a mine-mouth lignite fired thermal power plant with an initial
generating capacity of 130 MW at Asam Asam near Banjarmasin in South
Kalimantan and related transmission facilities; (c) procurement of two barge-
mounted power plants of 10 MW and 30 MW capacity respectively; and
(d) technical assistance comprising: (i) engineering and construction supervision
of Besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power plants; (ii) strengthening
the capability of GOI for environmental management in the coal mining sector;
(iii) promoting demand management; (iv) strengthening the enviromnental
management capability of PLN; and (v) implementing pilot projects for PLN's
Regions IV and VI in South Sumatera and South Kalimantan respectively to
improve their operating efficiency.
Benefits:     The policy reform underlying the project will change the structure and dynamics
of Indonesia's power sector. Opening the sector to private investors and
restructuring PLN will expand the financial envelope for system expansion and

enhance incentives for lowering the cost and improving the reliability of service.
Specifically, the investment components of the proposed project will help PLN
meet increases in eleciricity demand in South Sumatera and South Kalimantan
and improve service reliability, as wel' as mitigate periodic power shortages in
these regions. The Besai hydroelectric power plant will help substitute oil-fired
generation in the region by a renewable energy source. The Banjarmasin
thermal power plant will produce electricity at the mine mouth utilizing a cheap
source of fuel Oignite) that is non-tradeable and of no other cormercial value.
Further, technical assistance will help strengthen the environmental management
capabilities of the Bureau of Environment and Technology in the Ministry of
Mines and Energy, as well as PLN. Support for demand management will help
reduce the growth rate in electricity demand and curtail peak load in the
interconnected grid systems of PLN. Also, the proposed pilot projects in PLN's
Regions IV and VI will help transformation of the respective systems into profit
centers to improve the efficiency of operations.
Rialks:       The GOI has an excellent track record in carrying out reforms to which it has
committed. While the scope of the proposed sector, institutional and regulatory
reform is ambitious, the main elements are firmly embedded in the
Government's policy agenda. The risks of delays in implementing the reform
are within a relativel-' smal! range, considering the magnitude of the envisaged
changes. Specifically, there is a risk that delays in carrying out the planned
large development program would not reduce supply shortages and substitute
costly captive power generation to the extent expected. There is litfle risk that
the px er generation components of the proposed project would become
redundant if the projected levels of electricity demand fail to materialize, since
they are part of the core expansion program of PLN and justified under the
projected demand scenarios. Project implementation risks are small; the
geological and hydrological conditions of the Besai site well known and stable,
respectively.  The risks of schedule slippage and cost overruns in the
implementation of the coal-fired Banjarmasin thermal power plant are minor
considering PLN's experience in project management and carefully worked out
implementation schedule.

THE ENERGY SECTOR
1.1        l-donesia is endowed with large and diverse energy resources including crude oil,
natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal. Oil has played a crucial role in the country's
development. In the early 1980s, oil's importance in the Indonesian economy peak.d as oil
accounted for 80 percent of the country's export earnings, and most of the government's rev;uues
came from oil. Following the collapse of oil prices in the first half of the 1980s, Indonesia initiated
a series of fundamental reforms to restructure and diversify the economy by providing incentives
for non-oil/LNG manufacturing and exports. While the oil and gas sectors continue to retai-, a
fundamental role in Indonesia's economy, with oilALNG exports of about US$10.5 billion in 1992,
(about 30 percent of total exports), non-oil/LNG exports have now become the engine o
Indonesia's external trade with about US$24.8 bHilion in 1992. A detailed overview of the energy
resources is given in Annex 1.1.
1.2        Indonesia's domestic energy consumption has been growing rapidly.  Overall
domestic net energy use has grown from about 166 milliec  barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 1985
to about 263 million boe in 1992, a compound rate of 6.8 per cent per annum; with liquid
petroleum products accounting for about 78 percent of net energy consumed, and the share of
natural gas at approximately 10 percent. Liquid petroleum product consumption is currently
increasing at about 13 percent annually, after having grown at an average annual rate of about 6
percent from 1986 to 1989. During the 1980s, electricity consumption grew about 15 percent
annually and gas sales grew about 9 percent annually.
1.3        A primary objective of the energy policy in Indonesia is to satisfy the rapidly
growing demand for energy, while channeling liquid petroleum products for exports. The
Government is conscious of the need to conserve Indonesia's exportable surplus of crude oil and
thereby slow Indonesia's transition to net oil importer status. This requires the efficient use of
energy resources to be accomplished through appropriate pricing and other means, and the
development of alternative energy resources that can economically substitute for domestic petroleum
use, such as coal, non-exportable gas, geothermal, and hydropower. The power sector is a major
user of petroleuit fuels, especially in the Outer Islands (islands other than Java). Plans call for
further reducing oil's share in power generation, from about 44 percent in 1991 ( about 33 million
barrels of diesel and fuel oil), to about g percent by the end of this decade (10 million barrels per
year).
Energy and the Environment
1.4        The Environment Law in Indonesia (Law No. 4, 1982) provides that every project
likely to have a significant impact on the environment must be accompanied by an environmental
Impact analysis (AMDAL). Pursuant to this law, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, in its Decree



- 2 -
1158 (1989), established uniform procedures and guidelines for preparation, submission and
approval of an environmental impact analysis, as well as subsequent and periodic reporting on
envirormental management and monitoring during the project implementation phase. In the power
subscr, Techni9al assistane.e was provided under Loan 3098-4ND (Paiton Thermal Power
Project) to train a number of staff of the Ministry of Mines and Energy on environmental
management, and provide documentation for environmental guideiines and monitoring [para.
1.7(f)]. A separate directorate (Bureau of Environment & Technology) has recently been set up
to carry out the environmental management functions under a Director who also chairs the Central
Commission (AMDAL) for environmental clearances. Indonesia's emission standards are even
stricter in some respects th-n those of developed countries; for e-zample, the GOI standard for
sulfur dioxide emission is 260 lglm3 only as opposed to the USEPA and Bank standard of 500
,4gIm3, while the nitrous oxide emission standard is 92.5 /Ag/m3 against the USEPA and Bank
standard of 100 ug/m3. In order to monitor emission compliance, the Suraaya Thermial Power
Project (Loan 3501-IND) provides for the installation of receptors at strategic locations to monitor
the ground level concentrations of sulfurous and nitrous oxides, as well as of particulates, when
all seven units of the plant are placed into operation. The proposed project includes technical
assistance to both MME and PLN to further enhance their environmental management capabilides.
The Government's Objectives and Strategy
1.5         The energy sector is expected to continue to play a key role in the future
development of the economy. The GOI's main objectives for ttie sector are:
(a)   the economic (ecficency) objective: to ensure efficient and reliable supply of
electricity at least cost, while closing the gap between supply and demand, by
constructing new generating capacity and extending the transmission and distribution
network; to promote private sector participation to produce electricity and harness
the capacity from captive power plants.
(b)   the resource mobilizaion (fiscal and financial) objective:  to maximize the
country's foreign exchange earnings and budgetary revenues from the sector, mainly
through the export of tradeable energy resources, including oil, gas and coal; to set
power tariffs at economic costs to enable producers of energy to recover their costs
and obtain sufficient resources to finance their growth and development;
(c)   the instutonal objective: to restructure the energy institutions and regulations in
response to new challenges emanating from the reform of the sector, and to improve
the efficiency of the energy institutions, while enhan.,ing the quality of manpower
resources;
(d)   the social (equality and fairness) objective: to promote a regionally balanced
development of the country and to enable the majority of the people to afford the
basic services provided by electricity (lighting, cooking) at affordable rates to
improve their standard of living;
(e)   the enionmental objective: to define and promote energy conservation measures
and environmental protection to promote the production ana utilization of energy
resources in a manner that will ensure sustainable development and help conserve
the environment for future generations.



- 3 -
1.6        In pursuing the above objectives, GO  has relied on the following key policy
improvements:
(a)   petroleum product prices: While several adjustments were made earlier, but since
January 1993, the GOI has maintained the average price of petroleum products at
international parity, (efficiency pricing) while cross-subsidizing the price of kerosene
with an implicit tax on gasoline through the operation of the BBM (petroleum
products) Fund (Annex 1.1). However, with the recent softening of crude oil
prices, the domestic prices of petroleum products, including kerosene, are now
pegged above their economic cost.
(b)   electicity tariff: The GOI maintains electricity rates at low levels for small
residential, commercial and industrial consumers, who account for about 40 percent
of PLN's sales. Periodic adjustments in the average sale price (the latest average
increase of 13 percent, effective February 1, 1993) have generally maintained the
average price close to the long-run marginal cost of supply in Java (para 6.15).
(c)   private sector participation: The private sector operates significant captive power
capacity, and is expected to play an increasingly important role in the supply of gas
and electricity. Independent power generation projects, which would supply power
to PLN's grids, totaling about 2,600 MW of capacity are expected to be
commi&sioned over the next five years on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis
(para. 2.11), of which about 500 MW -would be outside Java.
(d)   protecting the poor: Historically, the GOI has subsidized the consumption of
electricity by small residential, as well as small non-residential customers. The GOI
had maintained the price of kerosene below its econovaic cost, though this is no
longer the case [para 1.6 (a)I.
(e)   regionally balanced development: The GOI has (i) maintained a uniform price
structure for petroleum products and electricity in all parts of the country, and
(ii) extended the supply of petroleum products and electricity in a balanced manner
to all parts of the country. These policies entail the subsidization of the higher cost
of energy supplies to the Outer Islands and to remote areas.
(t)   environmental protection:   In 1992, the Government created a Bureau of
Environment in the Ministry of Mines and Energy with permanent staff to supervise
various environmental aspects in the energy and mining sectors. In addition, a
separate body in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Commission for
Environment has the authority to review and approve Environmental Assessments,
including their mitigation, management and monitoring plans, for all investment
projects.
Institutions in the Energy Sector
1.7         The principal agency responsible for implementing Government policies in the energy
sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). MME coordinates all activities in the energy
sector and supervises the state enterprises in the sector: Pertamina (oil, gas and geothermal),
P.T. Bukit Asam (coal), PGN (gas distribution) and PLN (electricity). Other ministries and



-4-
agencies are also Involved in the sector; for example, the Ministry of Public Works, which is
responsible for hydropower resource surveys and the operation of multipurpose hydro plants, dhe
National Atomic Energy Commission, which is responsible for nuclear development, and
BAPPENAS, which provides sector planning and policy guidelines. An inter-ministerial National
Energy Board (BAKOREN) coordinates energy policies and development with those of other
sectors. BAKOREN is supponed by a Technical Committee (PTE) consisting of senior officials
of different departments, chaired by the Director General of Electricity and Energy Development
(DGEED). The organization chart of the MME is shown in Annex 1.2.

ELECTRIC POWER
The Electricity Sector
2.1         The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for electricity
sector. Under this Act, PLN, the State Electricity Corporation that was established by Government
Regulation No. 18/1972, has both the right and obligation to supply power in Indonesia. The
provisions of the Electricity Act are amplified in Government Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN,
the State Electricity Corporation; and No. 10/1989 for others. The Electricity Act permits
establishment of private power producers, distributors and licensees. Presidential Decree No.
37/1992 specifically authorizes private sector participation under Build-Operate-Own (BOO)
schemes, and allows cooperatives and other legal entities to generate, transmit, and distribute power
for public use.
2.2         At present, the sector comprises: (i) PLN; (ii) captive plants installed by private
parties for their own use; (iii) three Government-sponsored rural electric cooperatives; and (iv) a
large number of informal microenterprises providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural
villages not served by PLN. PLN accounts for about half of the electricity used by industries, and
the rest is provided by captive generation facilities. In 1992, the total installed captive generation
capacity was about 8,500 MD of which about 3,300 MD was reserve capacity that served as a
backup to PLN supply (Table 2.1). Annex 2.1 shows the growth in captive plants in Indonesia.
2.3        Indonesia's power sector has grown rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. PLN's
installed capacity increased five-fold from 2,288 MW in 1978 to 10,874 MW in 1992, as its sales
grew at an annual average rate of 16 percent from 4,287 GWh in 1978 to 34,964 GWh in 1992.
A statistical profile of the power sector is presented in Table 2.1, while Annex 2.2 shows the
growth in PLN's consumers, connected load, and energy sales. In spite of this rapid growth, there
is considerable unmet demand at economic prices. In 1992, PLN could serve only about 44
percent of the urban households and 29 percent of the rural households, for an overall household
electrification ratio of about 34 percent (Table 2.1), whereas at least 90 percent of the urban
households and two thirds of the rural households are estimated to be able to afford purchase of
electricity.
2.4         The potential for future growth in electricity sales remains high in Indonesia.
Residential energy sales are expected to increase as the household electrification ratio and incomes
increase, and industrial sales are expected to increase as the industrial sector GDP grows at an
expected rate of about 10 percent per annum for this decade (Annex 2.3).

The Outer Islands
2.5         The Outer Islands comprise all of Indonesia's islands except iava,.j including
Sumatera (population: 34 million), Sulawesi (population: 12.5 million), Kalimantan (population:
9 million), and some 3,000 smaller inhabited islands of Indonesia. The Outer Islands constitute
approximately 95 percent of Indonesia's land mass, with approximately 40 percent of the country's
population, while accounting for only about 20 percent of PLN's sales and about 30 percent of
PLN's installed capacity. The household electrification level in the Outer Islands is about 27
percent (1992), compared to about 38 percent in Java-Bali. At the same time, residential sales
constitute about 47 percent of PLN's sales in the Outer Islands, but only 31 percent in Java-Bali.
Further, PLN's average energy sales per customer in the Outer Islands is about half the Java-Bali
average.
2.6         The operational characteristics of the power supply systems in Outer Islands are
different from those in Java-Bali. The Java-Bali grid is an extensive interconnected system with
a number of large, central generating plants, a relatively high load factor, and high capacity (500
kV) transmission lines. In contrast, except for a few small grid systems based on low capacity
(150 kV or lower) transmission lines, PLN's operations in the Outer Islands depend upon a large
number of small, isolated diesel generators, with a lower load factor than in Java-Bali. Most of
PLN's electricity sales within the Outer Islands are concentrated within the urban areas of the
territories. Further, the share of captive power in total installed capacity is significantly higher in
the Outer Islands than in Java-Bali (Table 2.1).
2.7         PLN's operations in the Outer Islands are organized into 11 geographical Regions.
The proposed Besai hydroelectric plant (para 5.3) would be located in Region IV (southern
Sumatera), which is the second largest of PLN's Outer Islands Regions in terms of energy
sales,Z/ and the proposed Banjarmasin thermal plant (para 5.4) would be located in Region VI
(southern Kalimantan), which is the third largest of PLN's Regions.
Electricity Consumption Forecasts
2.8         The electricity consumption forecasts, along with the key underlying assumptions,
for Java-Bali and the Outer Islands are presented in Annex 2.3. The average annual growth rate
of sales over 1991-2003 is projected to be around 12 percent, including PLN sales as well as
captive power self-consumption, for both Java-Bali and the Outer Islands. The industrial and
residential sectors account for the bulk of the growth in sales for both the Java-Bali system and the
Outer Islands.
2.9         PLN's sates forecasts. The forecasts show that PLN's energy sales, including power
purchased from private producers (para 2.11), are expected to grow at annual average rates in the
range of 12-14 percent per year over 1991-2003, with the growth rate in the Outer Islands higher
than in Java-Bali. PLN's share in total electricity consumption is projected to increase slightly
from 76 percent (1992) to 81 percent (2003) for Java-Bali, and from 32 percent to 36 percent for
the Outer Islands over the same period. A substantial part of the increase in PLN's sales is
expected to come from additional sales to industrial consumers, with the share of industrial
1/ Bali is served by the interconnected Java-Bali grid.
2/ The largest is Region 1I (North Sumatera).



- 8 -
consumers in PLN's sales rising from 54 percent (1992) to 56 percent (2003) for Java-Bali, and
from 37 percent to 49 percent for the Outer Islands over the same period.
Development and Investment Program
2.10        The development program to meet the projected increase in PLN's sales takes
account of the expected participation by private generators. Annexes 2.4 and 2.5 siummarize the
program's generation expansion component for the Java-Bali system and for the Outer Islands as
a whole up to the year 2003.
2.11        Private Sector Participation. The power sector has already been opened to private
sector participation, beyond captive power generation. In a major change from the past, the private
sector is expected to supply power to PLN's grid systems, and the Government has earmarked
several generating projects for independent power producers on a Build, Own, and Operate (BOO)
basis. In this context, PLN has very recently signed a power purchase agreement with a private
producer to supply 2 x 600 MW of power at PLN's Paiton thermal power station site in East Java,
and the GOI is actively seeking private sector participation in the construction of two additional
units of 600 MW each at Paiton. Further, a private promoter, Cikarang Listrindo, has installed
76 MW of open cycle capacity (2 x 38 MW) to sell electricity to consumers located in five
industrial estates in the vicinity of Bekasi, West Java. This plant is also connected to PLN's 150
kV network, and supplies a limited amount of power to PLN.
2.12        Overall, the private sector is expected to play a significant role in the development
program to meet PLN's projected sales. This program envisages that, over 1994-1998, private
sector participants will account for about 27 percent of the net capacity addition of about 8,000
MW for the Java-Bali grid, and about 18 percent of the net capacity addition of about 2,700 MW
in the Outer Islands. Private sector investments in generation facilities that will sell power to PLN
are estimated to be about US$3.8 billion over REPELrrA VI (1994-1998), of which about US$2.9
billion wi}l be in Java-Bali, and about US$0.9 billion outside Java, while PLN's investments are
expected to be about US$17.4 billion (para 2.14). These investments include initial expenditures
for plants that will be commissioned after REPELITA VI.
2.13        In addition to grid based generating capacity, the private sector will also install
additional captive power plants, based on its own needs. Captive plant owners are expected to
continue to produce significant amounts of power for their own use. In 1992, captive power
owners produced about 23 of the electricity consumption in Java-Bali, and about 65 percent of the
electricity consumption in the Outer Islands; by 2003, these shares are projected to decrease
slightly to about 18 percent in Java-Bali and to 63 percent in the Outer Islands (Annex 2.3).
2.14        PLN. PLN's expansion of its operations to meet the additional future load, after
taking account of expected private sector participation, is constrained by the financial resources
available to it. The outer envelope of financing available to PLN for REPELITA VI from all
sources-Government contributions, self-financing, and borrowings-has been estimated at about
Rp. 50 trillion (US$17.4 billion in constant 1993 prices). PLN has prepared a core plan consistent
with this resource mobilization constraint (Table 2.2). After accounting for the estimated private
sector participation, PLN will continue to be responsible for the bulk of the investment in the
power sector. Annexes 2.6 and 2.7 provide estimates of PLN's annual requirements of investments
up to year 2003, expressed in constant 1993 US dollar equivalent, for the Java-Bali system and the
Outer Islands, respectively.

2.15        PLN's generation expansion plans are derived from least-cost planning models. For
the Java-Bali grid, about 70 percent of the planned gross generation expansion over 1994-2003 is
based on coal, while the expansion plan for the Outer Islands calls for a substantial reduction in
the share of diesel-based generation of (from 68 percent in 1992 to 26 percent by 2003), with
increases in the shares of coal, hydro, geothermal, and natural gas.
Strategic Sector Issues
2.16        The challenge.  After two decades of rapid growth in electricity production,
Indonesia's power sector is now at a crossroads. Maintaining past rates of growth and improving
further the efficiency of operations and quality of service will require structural changes in order
to mobilize financing and manage operations effectively. The time has come for fundamental
changes, amounting to a major reform of Indonesia's power sector. Several key issues have to be
addressed in a coordinated manner in order to bring about these changes.
2.17        Private sector participation.  The 001 has concluded that private sector
participation is a pre-requisite for reducing the financial burden on the GOI as well as increasing
the efficiency of electricity production. While the GOI has already earmarked several generation
projects for private investors, and the power sector's development program is predicated upon their
participation, (para. 2.12), major policy and institutional changes are needed to encourage private
investments.
2.18        PLN's performance. While PLN has been steadily improving its operations, and
has successfully constructed and operated the Java-Bali grid, PLN's performance does not yet meet
best utility practices. Since piece-meal, incremental changes would not any longer allow PLN to
go beyond marginal improvements, structurl changes are needed to further improve PLN's
performance. Efficiency improvements are particularly needed in the Outer Islands, where
management constraints have impeded progress. Several policy and institutional changes have to
be made to facilitate the development in the Outer Islands of interconnected grids, based on large
generating plants, to replace the small, isolated uneconomical diesel-based generating units.



- 10-
2.19        Sectoral development and regulation. With the emergence of a significant role for
the private sector, a new sectoral agency would be required to regulate both PLN and the private
operators. There would also be a need for a central agency to jointly optimize PLN's and private
investors' development strategies, based on least-cost considerations.
2.20        Power tariffs. The present ad hoc tariff setting modalities will not be appropriate
in the future. The mechanism for setting power tariffs should allow PLN to deal effectively with
the private sector, and to be able to maintain its financial health in an increasingly competitive
environment.

THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE WITH PAST LENDING,
AND STRATEGY IN THE POWER SECTOR
Experience with Past Lending
3.1        Overview. The Bank group has played a very active role in the development of the
power sector in Indonesia. Since 1969, it has provided about $4.1 billion for the power sector,
through three IDA Credits, 18 loans and one supplemental loan. The primary focus of the Bank's
activities was the Java-Bali grid, although some of the projects had nation-wide benefits. A list of
past lending operationrL is provided in Annex 3.1. Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) and
Project Completion Reports (PCRs) on the first 14 projects have concluded that the Bank has made
positive contributions towards the development of the Indonesian power sector over the past 20
years by improving PLN's project implementation, operational and managerial capabilities and
helping Indonesia meet critical demands for electricity. These reports attribute the success of
power operations in Indonesia to the facts that: (i) there was a long-term vision for the
development of the sector and this vision was shared by the Bank, Govermment and PLN; (ii) the
vision was translated into a long-term strategy which was resolutely pursued, and (iii) a reasonable
balance was struck between the physical and the institutional development components of the
projects.
3.2        Power Facilities. The infrastructure components of the Bank-supported projects
helped PLN expand its generation capacity of thermal, hydroelectric and geothermal power plants,
and associated transmission and distribution facilities.  These projects also supported the
Government's objective of diversifying domestic energy consumption away from oil by the use of
coal, hydropower and geothermal. At the beginning of this decade, PLN's installed capacity had
grown to more than 10 times what it was at the beginning of the 1970s, and to more than 2.5 times
what it was at the beginning of the 1980s; Bank-financed projects have accounted for 3,800 MW
of the approximately 7,600 MW of generating capacity operating in Java in 1992/93.
3.3        Institutional Development. Bank operations have consistently focused on institution
building. During its association with the Bank, PLN has substantially improved its project
implementation, operational and managerial performance. PLN has made significant progress in
improving the efficiency of its operations. In particular, over the period 1983/841992/93, PLN's
transmission and distribution losses have decreased from 21 percent to 12 percent; annual energy
sales per employee have increased from 223 MWh to 627 MWh; and overall consumers' accounts
receivable have decreased from 68 to 36 days' sales (Annex 4.2). Technical Assistance has also
been provided, inter alia, to strengthen PLN's corporate and financial planning and accounting
functions.



- 12 -
3.4         Fnancal Performance. Bank operations have also focused on PLN's financial
performance. In view of PLN's negative rate of return (ROR) at that time, a ROR covenant was
adopted under the Fourteenth Power Project Loan (Loan 2443-IND) in 1984. This covenant was
modified in 1987 under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND) to
provide for separate financial performance targets for PLN's operations in Java (ROR of no less
than 8 percent) and outside Java (to breakeven), in view of their different operational
characteristics. Initially, the government did not permit the necessary tariff increases, with the
result that the Bank did not approve further loans in 1987 and 1988, although project preparation
continued. The Government increased tariffs in 1989, 1991, and most recently, effective February
1, 1993. PLN's operations in Java-Bali are largely profitable, but PLN makes a loss on its
operations in the Outer Islands (paras. 6.2-6.3).
3.5         Implementation  Problems.   The main problems experienced  with  the
implementation of power projects in Indonesia have been: (i) delays in the selection and
appointment of consultants, procurement of goods and works, acquisition of land and the right-of-
way for the construction of transmission and distribution facilities, and (ii) difficulties encountered
in effective absorption of Technical Assistance. Generally, rigid budgetary procedures, outdated
consultant fee schedules, delays in finalizing contracts with winning bidders, unsatisfactory
performance of lo. d contractors, and shortage of trained personnel within PLN, have delayed the
implementation of pievious projects. These problems are germane to the implemenion of most,
and not just power, projects in Indonesia, and the Government is devising plans to address these
problems, based on the recent performance review of the projects in the Bank's portfolio.
Strategy in Support of Sector Policy Agenda
3.6         Dialogue with Government. Based on the dialogue between the Bank and 001, a
consensus has emerged that fundamental policy changes are needed for efficient long-run
development of the power sector in Indonesia. The Government has expressed its strategy in a
Policy Statement, "Goals and Policies for the Development of the Electric Power Subsector,*
(Annex 3.2) and has stated its intentions to implement it. The Bank intends to support this strategy
through the proposed project as well as the future Rural Electrification H (scheduled for Board
presentation in the next fiscal year), Sumatera Power Project, and Renewable Energy projects. The
key elements of the Bank's support are described below.
3.7         Policy Framework. The power sector development agenda has four major aspects:
(i) expanding entry to the sector to increase the participation of private investors and operators; (ii)
corporatizing and restructuring PLN to improve the efficiency of its operations; (iii) reforming
regulatory and sectoral development functions; and (iv) strengthening sector finance through
periodic power tariff adjustments. Taken together, these policy changes should lead to an increased
role for the private sector, while restructuring and reorganizing PLN with an ultimate intention of
divestiture in the future, with the social and public interests safeguarded by an appropriate
regulatory agency.
3.8         Private Sector Participation. The Government expects the private sector to play
a significant role in satisfying Indonesia's electricity needs in the future (paras. 2.11-2.13). To
achieve this goal, there is a need to expand the options for private sector participation beyond BOO
schemes, e.g., purchase of electricity on the basis of competitive bidding, unsolicited proposals,
licensing private generation in industil estates and franchising geographical areas to licensees for
the generation andlor distribution of electricity, and transmission access. However, private sector



- 13 -
participation, at present, is constrained by the lack of a transparent, comprehensive and consistent
regulatory framework that defines the rules for, and facilitates the operation of private power
enterprises. Some steps towards addressing this constraint have already been completed. First,
the Government has established a Directorate of Private Power under DGEED in the Ministry of
Mines and Energy. Second, the Governmenit is following-up on the findings of a study by two
international consulting firms, sponsored by the Bank with financing from the Norwegian
Consultant Trust Fund, which addressed, inter alia, structural changes to promote an increased
private sector role. (para. 3.16).
3.9         As a follow-up, the GOI is initiating an action-oriented study ("Private Power
Development Study"), with the assistance of experienced consultants to be financed by the Bank,
under the Infrastructure Technical Assistance Project (Loan No. 3385-IND), to develop a
comprehensive Private Power Program. The TOR for this study have been finalized, and the
consultants are expected to complete their work by March 1995. The TOR call for the consultants
to: (i) assess the current incentives for private sector participation; (ii) evaluate alternative options
for private sector participation; (iii) identify changes in sector organization that would encourage
private investors; (iv) review all existing laws and regulations related to the power sector, and
recommend modifications as well as additional regulations; (v) recommend a financing framework
for private power projects to expedite the project negotiation process; and (vi) recommend a Private
Power Program, including all activities required to implement it, such as development of guiding
policies and detailed rules, institutional adjustments, staffing, project identification and
development.
3.10        During negotiadons for the proposed loan, an agreewent was reached with the
Government that it will: (a) undertake and, by March 31, 1995, complete a study on private power
develcpment in accordance with terns of reference and in a manner satisfactory to the Bank,
(b) upon completion of the said study, furnsh the same for review and comments to, and discuss
the results and recommendations thereof with, the Bank, and (c) based on the said stu4's resuls
and recommendations and subsequent review, comments and discussions: (1) prepare draft rudes
and procedures to govern private sector participation including the solicitation and evaluation of
allforms ofproposalsfor private power supply, f i) furnish the said draft rules and procedures for
review and comments to the Bank, and Riii) by December 31, 1995, finalize, adopt and enforce the
same takiig into account the comments, if any, thereon by the Bank.
3.11        As a precursor to the Private Power Program, the GOI is planning to develop bulk
power purchase and supply tariffs, and is engaged in a dialogue with the Bank on this issue.
Concrete actions on these tariffs will be part of the Bank's next power sector lending operation
(Rural Electrification IT), and the GOI has also expressed its intention to develop a transmission
access procedures and tariff. Bulk purchase power tariffs, pegged to PLN's avoided costs, will
encourage efficient private sector levels and modes of participation in electricity generation by
small producers; the rates for large independent producers would continue to be set by negotiations
in a competitive environment. Similarly, a bulk power supply tariff, based on PLN's economic
cost of supply, will encourage efficient private sector participation in distribution. Further, a
"transmission service tariff would permit independent producers to sell power direcdy to
consumers by "wheeling" power from their generating facilities to the consumers, and paying PLN
a fee for utilizing its transmission network.
3.12        Restructuring PLN. The GOI's strategy for restructuring PLN has two inter-related
aspects: (i) decentralization and commercialization, and (ii) corporatization. To improve its



- 14 -
financial performance as well as the quality and efficiency of service, PLN has already initiated a
reorganization of its structure and management system, based on a plan developed with the
assistance of consultants under Bank financing. To assist in the ongoing reorganization of PLN,
and to further develop a detailed action plan for restructuring PLN ("PLN Restructuring Plan"),
an international consulting firm, financed as part of Technical Assistance under the Suralaya
Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND) has begun work, which is expected to be completed by
December 1994.
3.13        The TOR for the PLN Restructuring Plan call for the consultants to: (i) help
implement a decentralized and commercialized organization structure and management system,
including the establishment of profit centers along functional (generation, transmission, and
distribution) and geographical lines, with the managers of these profit centers given enhanced
decision-making responsibilities and made accountable for their performance; (ii) identify and
evaluate options for contracting out functions currently performed in-house by PLN; and (iii)
establish performance benchwarks for evaluating the performance of various PLN units, such as
PLN's Regions in the Outer Islands, and develop performance contracts and the incentives
framework for the managers of these units. To complement this activity, the proposed project
provides for Technical Assistance for PLN to set up pilot projects in PLN's Regions IV and VI to
demonstrate the feasibility of commercially oriented operations in the Outer Islands (para. 5.19).
3.14        Another key element of the GOI's strategy in restructuring PLN is a change in its
corporate status from a State-owned agency with a social purpose (Perum) to a group of profit-
oriented limited liability companies (Perseros), with private participation in their ownership as soon
as their financial performance permits. During negotiations for the proposed loan, an agreement
was reached that the Government shalljointly with PLN: (a) take the necessary measures required
to reorganize PLNV into a limited liability company (Persr; (b) by December 31, 1994, furnish
to the Bank a progress report concerning the reorganization of PLNV together with a draft ie
bound corporate reorganization and restructuring action planfor PLNto operate according to best
utility practices; (c) discuss the said progress report and draft action plan with the Bank; and
(d) immediately thereafter, finalize the said action plan taking into account the comments, if any,
thereon by the Bank.
3.15        As an initial step, the Government intends to convert PLN to a Persero with a
provisional balance sheet and the current organization structure. The conversion of PLN's status
to a Persero would require a re-definition of PLN's capital structure and financial operating regime,
including the valuation of its assets. Over time, the GOI intends that the group of companies
would compete in a market-oriented environment, with Government exercising strategic control
over them on an "arm's length" basis through performance contracts that specify clear objectives
and efficiency indicators. During negotiations for the proposed loan, an understanding was
reached with the Government that it will appoint, by December31, 1994, an internationally reputed
accounting and management flm to provde advice and assistance on financial issues, including
the valuation of PLVs assets, related to the conversion of PLN's status to a Persero.
3.16        Regulatory Reform. A Bank sponsored study, with financing from the Norwegian
Consultant Trust Fund, has identified the broad elementts of regulatory reform needed in view of
the evolution of the power sector. An initial step towards the establishment of a sectoral regulatory
oversight agency will be the separation of those functions that relate to the power industry's
regulation and oversight from the functions that relate to power sector policy and planning. To this



- 15 -
end, the Government intends to initially establish a Directorate of Regulation within DGEED, with
a view to this later being converted to a higher level agency with greater autonomy and authority.
3.17        In order to identify and define further specific changes needed, the Ministrv of Mines
and Energy will undertake a major review, with the assistnce of consultants to be financed by the
Bank as Technical Assistance under the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase II Project (Loan 3602-IND),
of the power sector's current organization and legal and regulatory framework, with the aim of
formulating and implementing fresh regulations and strengthening the Directorate of Regulation
("Regulatory Reform Study"). The TOR for this study have already been finalized, and the
consultants are expected to complete their work by Ma%ch 1995, in conjunction with the Private
Power Development Study (para. 3.9). The TOR for the Regulatory Reform study call for the
consultants to: (i) formulate draft by-laws, regulations, and/or decrees necessary to reform the
regulatory framework, including (a) the definition and separation of the responsibilities of the
associated government administrative units, and of the publicly-owned and private enterprises, and
(b) the structure and staffing needs of an electricity regulatory body; and (ii) a phased action plan
to progressively implement the proposed reforms.
3.18        During negotiations for the proposed loan, an agreement was reacned with the
Government that it will: (a) undertake and, by March 31, 1995, complete a study on regulatory
reform in the power sector in accordance with terms of reference and in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank, (b) upon completion of the said study, furnish the samefor review and comments to, and
discuss the results and recommendations thereof with, the Bank; and fc) based on the said study's
results and recommendanons and subsequent review, comments and discussons: (O) prepare draft
regulations for the power sector, Qii) furn  sh the said draft regulations for review and comments to
the Bank, and fiii) by June 30, 1996, finalize, adopt and enforce the same taking into account the
comments, if any, thereon by the Bank.
3.19        Sectoral Development.  Effective management of increased private sector
participation will require a transfer of responsibility for power sector development to a central
agency in the MME, which would ensure that the demand for electricity is met in jointly optimized
least-ost manner, taking account of the roles of both PLN and private investors. The central
agency would project the future demand for electricity, and determine the most effective mode of
meeting the demand, based on an assessment of private sector participation under the prevailing
system of rules and incentives, and of PLN's resource availability and hnplementation capabilities.
This would help to ensure that the iming, size and location of aU large generation plants, including
those of PLN and private promoters, are part of an overall least-cost generation expansion plan.
The Government intends to upgrade DGEED's capacities in the areas of demand forecasting and
least-cost system expansion planning. In this context, PLN is planning to formulate rolling
contingency plans to respond to any supply/demand imbalance due to changes in the anticipated
schedule of private sector participation.
3.20        During negotiations for the proposed loan an agreement was reached with the
Government that to ensure comitinued soundness of the power sector development program, GOI
will: (a) by December 31 each year, commencing in 1994: O7) review with the Bank. (1) its power
sector development program, (2) the least cost planning analysis used to formulate the said
program, (3) the roles of PL Wand the private sector in the said program, anu' (4) the transparency
and appropriateness of the busness environment for private power partipatw(n, (i) reviw with
the Bank and PLN, PUW's development and investnent programs with respect to: (1) their
consistency with GOI's power sector development progran, (2) the balance among generation,



-16-
transmission and distribution investnents, and (3) the balanced development of regions; and
(b) ensure that PLN has access to sufficient funds to finance its development and investment
programs.
3.21        Adjusting Power Tariffs. The Bank supports the importance that the GOI attaches
to the pricing of electricity so that there is efficiency in consumption and PLN's financial health
is ensured. The GOI intends to raise power tariffs as needed to ensure that PLN will attain the
stipulated rate of return in its operations (para. 6.10). As PLN's purchases of power from
independent power producers increase, it will become increasingly important that PLN's tariffs
adjust in response to changes in purchased power prices. The GOI intends to develop procedures
for periodic, formula-based adjustments to PLN's tariffs to take account of variations in fuel and
purchase power prices, exchange rate, and inflation. A detailed study on the issue of electricity
tariff has already been concluded by PLN with the help of a TA provided under an ADB loan. The
GOI is now considering the modalities of institutionalizing such adjustments (para. 6.11).
3.22        Energy Efrciency. The GOI uses efficiency pricing, complemented by other
appropriate measures, to encourage and induce sound electricity use decisions. In the power
sector, the GOI is focusing on more efficient utilization of electricity, introduction of renewable
energy in the rural areas, and demand management (DSM). The proposed project provides for
technical assistance for PLN to promote DSM (para. 5.19). This TA will assist PLN in: (i)
developing a rationalized strategy for DSM and the corresponding action plan, based upon data and
conditions specific to Indonesia, (ii) establishing realistic targets of penetration and savings to be
achieved, (iii) deternining efficient delivery and incentive mechanisms, and (iv) formulating the
financing plan for DSM.
3.23        Environmental Protection. The GOI recognizes that safeguarding the environment
is a prerequisite for sustainable development and encouraging conservation and diversification in
the use of energy resources will reduce any possible adverse environmental impacts of energy
consumption. The Bank will continue its support to efforts developed by the Government to put
in place the regulatory framework and institutions needed to achieve this. The proposed project
provides for technical assistance for PLN to improve their environmental management capabilities,
and introduce demand management (para. 5.19). This TA will assist PLN in developing its
capabilities to formulate corporate environmental policies, evaluate environmental assessments of
its development projects, and monitor enviromnental impact, and compliance with environmental
guidelines for existing projects. During project supervision, the Bank wiUl pay special attention and
resources to ensuring that the environmental protection regulations are implemented as intended.
Within the power sector, Bank project preparaion and supervision will be focused on careful
planning and design of new facilities so as to minimize and mitigate their impacts on the
environment and affected population, and on effective monitoring designed to ensure proper
compliance with applicable standards and practices.

THE BENEFICIY
4.1         The proposed loan would be made to the Government of Indonesia (GOI). The
proceeds of the proposed loan, except for a part for technical assistance to GOI frc improving the
enviromnental management capability of the Bureau of Environment and Technology under the
Ministry of Mines and Energy, would be orlent to PLN (para. 5.24), which is responsible for the
implementation of the proposed project. PLN, the sole government-owned national power utility,
has been the beneficiary of Bank Group lending to the power sector in Indonesia since 1969
(para. 3.1).
PLNs Organization
4.2         PLN was established as a public corporation (Perum) under a Presidential Decree
of 1972, that confers upon it the responsibility and obligation to manage Indonesia's power system,
Including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, and the planning, construction
and operation of electricity supply facilities (para. 2.1). At present, PLN operates in a centralized,
hierarchical manner, with PLN's Board of Directors having both managerial and supervisory
responsibilities. PLN's organization chart is shown in Annex 4.1.
4.3         For the Java-Bali system, the operational responsibility rests with the managers of
two generation ani transmission, four distribution centers and the Java-Bali load dispatch center.
Major construction is the responsibility of a number of project managers. For the Outer Islands,
the operational responsibility rests with the managers of PLN's eleven operating regions and the
special region of Batam island. Under the Regional Manager, there are four primary departments
with Deputy Managers in charge of Operations, Construction, Finance, and Administration. Each
Region has a number of branches and sub-branches. The branch manager is responsible for service
at the customer level, and reports directly to the Regional Manager. A Region may have one or
more generatilg Sectors, depending upon the scale of operations. At present, only Region IV has
a Load Dispatch Uotter. The Construction Divisions in the Regions have responsibility for only
for distribution lines anm small generation facilities (under 1 MW), with major construction being
the responsibility of PLN headquarters.
Jusfitutional Change
4.4         PLN's managing and operating capabilities have increased along with energy sales;
it has effectively managed a large investment program, and constructed and operated large coal-
fired plants in Java-Bali. However, PLN has reached the limits of its effectiveness under the
present organizational structure, and a detailed plan for restructring PLN is now being developed
(para. 3.12).



- 18 -
4.5         Under centralized control, the Managers of PLN's Regions in the Outer Islands have
limited planning and operational flexibility and discretion; correspondingly, their accountability for
operational efficiency is also limited. As a result, the Managers have little incentives or
opportunities to initiate steps to i;hlprove the quality and level of service and/or reduce costs by
introducing efficiency measures. Most of the financial planning is also done at PLN headquarters,
though the preparation and submission of the annual budget to headquarters is time-consuming.
Further, the staff in the Regions spend a significant part of their time preparing reports to be
transmitted to PLN's headquarters, without a clear sense of purpose or use of this information.
4.6         A major operational problem in the Outer Islands is the lack of proper maintenance
of generation facilities. This problem is particularly acute for the isolated diesel-based generation
units, which are comprised of a myriad of makes and vintage. Second, the Regions in the Outer
Islands face a shortage of qualified staff in most aspec  of their operations, and the training levels
are inadequate. There is also a shortage of computers and computer skills. Further, there is often
a mismatch between skills and responsibilities, such as mechanical engineers working in the
distribution department while electrical engineers work in the planning department. Third, some
of the Regions in the Outer Islands have significant captive power capacity that is not
interconnected to PLN's grids, though such interconnections have the potential of lowering PLN's
reserve requirements and improving the reliability of supply.
4.7         These, and other related issues, in the development of the power sector in the Outer
Islands point towards the need for institutional changes in PLN. The proposed project includes
Technical Assistance to undertake pilot projects in PLN's Regions IV and VI for this purpose
(para. 5.19).
Staff Development and Training
4.8         As of March 31, 1993, PLN had 55,737 employees, of whom 45,294 are permanent
staff. PLN had no difficulty in recruiting staff educated at levels up to technical high school, but
faces constraints in recruiting those with higher academic qualifications; the problem is particularly
acute in the Outer Islands. Overall, as well as in Regions IV and VI, less than 5 percent of its staff
have university degrees. To address its training needs, PLN has a separate training department that
plays an important role in PLN's efforts to upgrade the skills of its technical and administrative
staff.  These efforts have been largely successfid.  In 1992, about 8,000 staff received
training-about 7,800 in the country and about 200 abroad.
4.9         The Bank has supported PLN's training activities and human resources development
efforts, including the establishment of several training centers. The computer-based training center
at Suralaya has trained many of PLN's power plant staff in the operation and maintenance of
thermal power stations with significant success; the performance record of Suralaya Thermal Power
Plant compares favorably with any power station of comparative size in the industrialized world.
Current efforts being supported by the Bank include training in the areas of diesel/thermal plant
operations, distribution management, corporate and financial planning, general accounting and cash
management, as well as specific training activities in the rural electrification area and in public
utility practices.



- 19 -
Accounting and Budgeting
4.10        PLN's accounting system, installed in the early 1970s, follows generally accepted
accounting principles, and normal utility practices, but it needs upgrading to keep pace with the
growing complexity and volume of accounting transactions. The accounting system needs to
produce more accurate information in a timely manner for decision-making purposes. Also, PLN's
internal procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual expenditures need to be
strengthened through better coordination among and participation by the various functional
directorates and regional offices in the process, to enhance the budget's value as a management
tool.
4.11        A major constraint to PLN's accounting has been a lack of trained senior accountants
and uniform application of accounting procedures, and the problem is acute in the Outer Islands.
Since 1987, PLN has been implementing an action plan to improve its accounting practices and
functions. PLN is also attempting to improve coordination between its departments and its regional
offices in the areas of budget preparation, and monitoring and evaluation of performance.
Technical assistance is provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND) to
improve the accounting system, The Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) provides
technical assistance to continue to enhance the system for the segregation of PLN's accounting of
its RE operations.
Billing and Collections
4.12        PLN's bills are computerized and prepared monthly at the Jakarta headquarters; for
the Outer Islands, the bills are prepared at the branch level, and printed by the Region's Finance
Division. Overall collection performance is generally satisfactory. The receivables position of
general consumer accounts has been good, as it has been kept below one and one-half months of
the yearly billing. The overdues from government users (including the Armed Forces and local
governments), which account for about 10 percent of PLN's total sales, have also been maintained
to under two months' billing.
Audit and Internal Control
4.13        PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by Government auditors.
The audits are carried out following generally accepted accounting practices and standards. In the
audit reports for 1989 through 1992 there were no qualifications. As a result of joint efforts by
PLN and its auditors, the time required for completing PLN's audits has been reduced significantly
over the last three years. For 1992, the accounts were finalized within three months after the
closing of the fiscal year and the audited accounts were available within four months of the close
of the fiscal year. The audit covenant under Loan 3602-IND, that requires PLN to submit to the
Bank its audited financial statements and the report of s!fch audits no later than six months after
the end of eachfiscal year, was also agreed under the proposed project. In addition, PLN would
furnish to the Bank (1) a copy of its unaudited annual accounts whenever they are sent to the
auditors; and (ii) its segregated financial and operating information on rural activities within six
months after the end of each fiscal year.
4.14        The Bank is discussing with Government and PLN the desirability of having PLN's
accounts audited by internationally reputed commercial accounting firms, independently of
Government auditors. Such commercial audits would not only ensure timely availability of PLN's



- -0 -
audited accounts, but would also provide greater comfort to the capital markets, both domestic and
intemational, that PLN plans to access in future for borrowing as well as equity, the latter after
it is converted to a Persero, for funds to finance its capital expenditures.
4.15        PLN has an effective internal audit group which reports to the President Director for
various special investigations, in addition to keeping general and project accounting matters under
review.
Insurance
4.16        PLN currently carries transit and marine insurance on equipment and materials in
transit. Projects under construction are covered by the contractor's all risk and erection insurance.
Fire and other hazards on most of the assets in operation are self-insured. In view of the
geographical spread of PLN's assets, any single loss would be relatively small by comparison with
total assets and operations, and this policy has been considered satisfactory by the Bank. However,
with some very large projects having been completed in recent years and others now under
impleir-ntation, there would be a greater concentration of assets in certain locations than in the
past. An understanding was reached under Loans 3097-IND and 3098-IND that major works, plant
and equipment at large power projects would be insured with outside agencies. Accordingly, PLN
is currently carrying commercial insurance for major operating plants and equipment at several
large power projects totalling about 4,900 MW, in and outside Java.

TIE PROJECT
Backfgound
5.I        The Bank's involvement in hydroelectric power development in Indonesia dates back
to financing of the Saguling hydropower development under the Tenth Power Project (Loans 1950-
IND and 19501-IND) and Phase I of the Cirata development under the Thirteenth Power Project
(Loan 2300-IND), and Phase II of the Cirata development (Loan 3602-IND). In coal-fired power
development, the Bank has been involved in the construction of the first coal-fired power staticn
comprising 4 x 400 MW generating units at Suralaya in West lava, through the Eighth, Ninth,
Twelfth and the Fourteenth Power Projects (Loans 1708-IND, 1872-IND, 2214-IND and 2243-
IND), all of which are already in successful operation. Three additional units of 600 MW each
are under construction at Suralaya (Loan 3501-IND). In addition, two coal-fired units of 400 MW
each are being constructed at Paiton in East Java (Loan 3098-IND), the first unit of which has
already been placed in operation.
5.2        The Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project focuses on policy agenda of the power
sector, as well as institutional restructuring of PLN, which was included in a Policy Letter received
at negotiations of the proposed loan (para. 3.6). The policy agenda has been dibcussed in Chapter
3. The physical components of the project comprise: (a) construction of a hydroelectric power
plant with an initial generating capacity of 90 MW at Besai in South Sumatera and related
transmission facilities; (b) construction of a mine-mouth lignite fired power plant with an initial
generating capacity of 130 MW at Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan and related transmission
faciities; (c) procurement of two barge-mounted power plants of 10 MW and 30 MW capacity
respectively; and (d) technical assistance to GOI and PLN.
5.3         The Besai hydroelectric scheme is located in the upper reaches of the Besai river,
in the Lampung province of South Sumatera, draining into the Java Sea (Map No. IBRD 25507).
The Besai plant is planned as a run-of-river type development with a daily regulating storage
capacity. A generating capacity of 90 MW will be supported by the available hydro energy to
provide economical peaking capacity to the grid in close proximity to the load center. It aims to
supply electric power to PLN's Region IV in South Sumatera.
5.4        The mine-mouth Banjarmasin Thermal Power Plant is located at Asam Asam in
South Kalimantan, about 12 km inland from the coast, and 160 km from Banjarmasin (Map No.
IBRD 25508). Two units of 65 MW each will be built initially, using lignite as fuel, which is a
non-tradeable resource and available in sufficient quantities in the area. The lignite mine will be
developed by the coal company, PT Arutmin, that holds the concession to the coal mines. This
project component will service PLN's Region VI in South Kalimantan.



- 22 -
5.5         The demand forecast for PLN's Region VI indicates that shortage of power is likely
to be experienced in the region starting from 1995, until the proposed Banjarmasin thermal power
plant comes on stream. The mobile power plants (barge-mounted), to be procured specifically to
meet regional power shortages in the Outer Islands, are planned to be deployed temporarily in
Region VI for this purpose. The barge-mounted plants are expected to be moved from one area
to another as necessary, to cater to load demands when such periodic shortages are encountered.
Several areas in the outer islands, such as Banjarmasin, Batam, Pakanbaru, Bali, Pontianak,
Tanjung Pinang and Lombok are projected to experience power shortages at different times.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.6         The proposed Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project, in conjunction with the
subsequent Rural Electrification HI Project, forms an integral part of the Bank's lending strategy
for Indonesia. The two projects are supporting the initial phase of a comprehensive reform
program of the Government for the country's power sector. The Government has drawn on close
cooperation from Bank staff and technical assistance from ongoing Bank loans in developing the
agenda for reform: (a) opening the sector for substantial private investor/operator participation;
(b) restructuring the dominant public power utility PLN; (c) reforming power tariffs; and (d)
establishing effective regulatory oversight. These reforms will, through cost effective expansion
of reliable electricity services, contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of Indonesia's
productive and service sectors, as well as to enhancing the welfare of the population at large.
Through its focus on the islands of Sunatera and Kalimantan, the proposed project will also
support directly the Government's objective of achieving a more balanced inter-regional equity.
These objectives are fully consistent with the Country Assistnce Strategy discussed by the Board
on April 12, 1994.
Project Objectives
5.7         The main objectives of the proposed project are to support the first phase of the
Government's long-term policy agenda for the power sector aimed at efforts to: (a) increase private
sector participation to accelerate expansion of generating capacity and upgrade sector operating
standards and practices; (b) restructure PLN to improve its operational performance and service
efficiency; (c) formulate and implement regulations along with supporting administrative
arrangements to promote efficiency in sector operations; and (d) introduce a formula-based periodic
tariff adjustment mechanism to recover costs. In addition, the proposed project is to help finance
environmentally sustainable expansion of PLN's electricity generation and transmission capacity
in the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan with more economical central grid systems, as well as
provide technical assistance (TA) to the GOI and PLN in the areas of demand management,
efficiency improvement and environmental management.
Project Description
5.8         The policy component of the proposed project entails: (a) establishing a policy
framework for private sector participation; (b) restructuring PLN and establishing commercial
operations as a Persero (limited liability company); (c) implementing a framework for regulatory
oversight of the private sector and PLN; (d) introducing formula-based periodic adjustment of
tariff, as well as bulk power purchase and supply tariffs.

initial generating capacity of 130 MW at Asam Asam near Banjarmasin and related transmission
facilities in South Kalimantan; (c) procurement of two barge-mounted power plants of 10 MW and
30 MW capacity respectively. The barge-mounted power plants of 10 MW and 30 MW generating
capacity would be powered by diesel engines and gas turbines respectively. A more detailed
description of (a) and (b) is given in Annexes 5.1 and 5.2 respectively.
5.10        Technical assistance components include:  (i) engineering and construction
supervision of Besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power plants; (ii) strengthening the
capability of GOI in environmental management in the coal mining sector; (iii) promoting demand
management; (iv) strengthening the environmental management capability of PLN; and
(v) implementing pilot projects for PLN's Regions IV and VI in South Sumatera and South
Kalimantan respectively to improve their operating efficiency.
The Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project : Physical Components
5.11        Besai Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Besai Hydroelectric Power Plant includes:
(i) a 9 m high intake dam, with sluiceway, the scouringway and both abutments, complete with
gates and stoplogs; (ii) a headrace tunnel, surge tank and an underground penstock; (iii) a
powerhouse about 5 km downstream, to accommodate the 2 x 45 MW generating units; (iv) an
open channel tailrace; and (v) about 16 km long double-circuit, 150 kV transmission lines to
interconnect with the nearest transmission system  grid.   Engineering Consultants for
preconstruction engineering are already appointed and being funded under the Cirata II
Hydroelectric Phase II Project (Loan 3602-IND). Prequalification for Civil Works has been
concluded, bidding documents have been reviewed and cleared by the Bank, and the bidding
process is in progress. Draft bidding documents for all main contract packages have also been
prepared and submitted by PLN for Bank review.
5.12        Environmental Assessment and Resettlemen' Aspects.  The environmental
assessment (EA) summary is given in Annex 5.3. The total surtace area to be acquired for the
purpose of constructing the Besai plant is about 202 ha, out of which about 140 ha will be
inundated, while the rest (62 ha) will be required for the dam, power house, office complex and
housing colony, contractors' use and access roads. Even though no physical relocation is involved,
129 families will need to be provided with resettlement compensation, parts of whose land will be
acquired for the development or inundated by the reservoir. PLN has prepared an adequate
compensation package for tnese 129 affected families; offering land-for-land or cash compensation,
including a vocational training for those interested. The policy provisions of the plan are
satisfactory to the Bank; however, a number of clarifications are required from PLN for this plan
to be a useful tool for the implementing agency and to meet the requirements of public disclosure.
Public consultation held at the project site with NGO participation, reached broad agreement on
the positive socio-economic impacts of the project, as well as on the proposed resettlement plans.
5.13        hnplementation. (a) Engineering and ConstructionSupervision- PLN is responsible
for the implementation of the project and has appointed a project manager for the construction of
the Besai hydroelectric power plant. The engineering functions have been assigned to fully
experienced international consultants with local associates. About 84 staff months of foreign
consultants, and 76 staff months of local consultants time are estimated to be required;

Power Plant, located at Asam Asam, includes the construction of 2 x 65 MW coal-fired units and
associated transmission facilities to be provided for the evacuation of power from the plant that will
include double circuit 150 kV transmission lines: (a) about 75 km long, from Asam Asam power
plant to Cempaka; (b) about 43 km long, from Cempaka substation to Trisakti substation, with
(c) an interconnection at Trisakti of the 150 kV bus with the 70 kV bus, and (d) about 110 kn
long, from Cempaka to Barikin, this last section being funded totally by PLN. The site will
support an ultimate generating capacity of 660 MW, with 4 x 65 MW and 4 x 100 MW generating
units.
5.15        Environmental and Resettlement Aspects.   The environmental assessment
summary is given in Annex 5.6. The construction of the power plant will entail the acquisition by
PLN of 110 ha of land. Altogether 36 families will need to be resettled as a result of this
development, all of whom are residing on Government-owned land. PLN proposes to relocate
these 36 families to a new area of 10 ha in a contiguous block and is in the process of negotiating
authority for the release of the site with the Ministry of Forestry. When the site is released, PLN
will build comparable houses for the PAPs and also pay their expenses for relocation. This
relocation will need to be completed before acta construction of the power station starts in early
1995. PLN has budgeted adequate fimds to accomplish the resettlement plan. Public consultations
have been held at the project site with NGO participation and there is broad agreement on the
positive socio-economic impacts of the proposed project, as well as on resettlement plans. An
agreement was reached during negotiatons for the proposed loan that PLN shall cany out the
Resettlement Action Plans in a manner satfactory to the BankI A detailed survey of the right-of-
way for the transmission lines indicates no constraints or construction problems. A separate EA
for the coal mines has been performed. The EA reports in respect of these project components are
available at the Bank's Public Information Center.
5.16        hnplementation. (a) PLN is responsible for implementing the project and has
appointed a project manager for the Banjarmasin Thermal Power Plant, inclusive of its transmission
component. Timebound summary implementation plan and the schedule of procurement actions
are included in Annexes 5.7 and 5.8 respectively. Consultants for the project have also been
appointed under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND) for preconsttuction
engineering and design in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the selection of Consultants.
Unit 1 of the proposed plant is scheduled to be commissioned in December 1998 and Unit 2 in
March 1999.
5.17        Mobile Power Plants. The two barge-mounted power plants of 30 MW and 10 MW
capacity respectively will need to be procured by 1995, when power shortages in the South
Kalimantan area are likely to be encountered. The 10 MW power plant will use diesel engines,
while the 30 MW plant will have oil-fired gas turbines.
5.18        Environmental Assessment. The environmental impacts of the barge-mounted
power plants relate to cooling water use by the plants, proper conditioning of any oily wastes

loan, except $3.2 million for technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy (GOI) for
enWronmental management in the coal mining sector, to PL  under a subsdiay loan agreement
with a 20 year term includingfive years grace period; the subsidiary loan wlIl be denominated in
US dollars, and the onlending interest rate would be equal to the Bank's standard variable interest
rate plus 0.5 percent per annun. The foreign exchange risk wUIl be borne by PLA (para. 6.21).
Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PLN, satisfactory to the Bank, will be
a condition of effectiveness of the loan. The Austrian Government is expected to cofinance the
proposed project for the procurement of the Hydraulic Turbines and Generating Equipment for the
Besai hydroelectric power plant, while export credit will be sought for the supply, erection and
commissioning of the boiler package for the Banjarmasin thermal power plant. The associated high
voltage transmission connections for Banjarmasin are likely to be cofinanced by the Government
of Australia. During the negotiations of the proposed loan, GOI confirmation was obtained about
the cofinancing arrangements and export credit for the Besal and Banjarmasin plant conmonents
and an agreement was reached on dates bvy when these arrangements shall be finalized so that they
are consistent with the overall project unplementation schedule.
5.25        Procurement. Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are presented in
Table 5.4. The Bank-financed components are listed in para. 5.23; these will be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB). Domestic contractors would be eligible for a preference
in bid evaluation of 7.5 percent for the Civil Works, and domestic manufacturers would be eligible
for a preference of 15 percent of the CIF price or the actual import duty, whichever is the lower
of the two. Prequalification of contractors for civil works will be required. Consulting services
will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. In the
procurement of goods and works, the use of the Bank's standard bidding documents will be
mandatory, with such modifications as the Bank may agree to be necessary for the purposes of the
project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, bidding
documents based on other internationally recognized standards may be used with the Bank's prior
agreement thereto. Prequalification and each contract for goods and works estimated to cost the
equivalent of $1.0 million or more are subject to the Bank's prior review. Since all Bank-financed
contracts for Goods and Works are estimated to cost more than $1.0 million, the prior review
process will cover 100 percent of the total contract value. Consultant contracts valued above
$100,000 for firns and above $50,000 for individuals will require prior review by the Bank. The
procurement procedures for non-Bank-financed components will not adversely affect the execution
of the project.
5.26        For fixed-price contracts, when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, the successfil bidder's bid price will be increased for each week of delay by two
predisclosed correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency
components and the other to the local currency component of the bid price, to be mentioned
transparently in the bidding documents. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the bid
evaluation.
5.27        PLN will initiate necessary steps to fiuther improve the efficiency of procurement
procedures. Bidding documents will be standardized in accordance with Bank guidelines and other
measures, as set out in Annex 5.14, will be implemented by PLN and GOI. The GOI has already
initiated necessary steps in this direction by amending Government Regulation No. 29 (KEPRES
29) which seeks to simplify the procurement procedures of government projects.

5.29        Disbursements.  The schedule of disbursements for the Bank-financed project
components and that for cofinancing are shown in Annex 5.15, together with the standard
disbursement profile for Indonesia power projects. The disbursements against the proposed loan
for Bank-financed items will be somewhat slower than the standard profile during the initial years
of project implementation, owing to simultaneous processing of several components of the project.
The project is expected to be eo.npleted by December 31, 1999 and the loan closing date will be
June 30, 2000.
5.30        In order to facilitate disbursements for PLN under the proposed loan, a Special
Account in the amount of US$8.0 million, would be established. The account would be maintained
in US dollars and represents approximately four months of average expenditures. The amount
withdrawn for the Special Account will be deposited in a bank on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank, and would be held in the name of the Director General (DG) of Budget, Ministry of
Finance, following established procedures. The Special Account would be used for all eligible
foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account will be made on a monthly
basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever occurs first. At the
option of the DG Budget, individual application with a value of US$1.6 million equivalent (i.e.,
20 percent of the initial deposit) or more may be submitted outside the Special Account, using
normal disbursement procedures.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.31        GOI and PLN would implement the sector policy agenda as defined in GOI's Policy
Statement (para. 3.6) based on an agreed schedule. Agreements were reached during the
negotiations of the proposed loan that GOI and PLN would initiate actions as are necessary to meet
the mutually agreed schedule of implementation of the proposed policy agenda for the subsector,
as well as that of PLN, under schedules agreed with the Bank that are shown individually in
Chapter 8.
5.32        PLN would designate a manager, satisfactory to the Bank, to facilitate overall
coordination of the various physical components of the project, help remove any bottlenecks in
their implementation, and ensure their completion on schedule.
5.33        PLN would present a report on the inspection and monitoring of the Besai dam for
review by the Bank, at two year intervals starting from 2002. Agreements were reached during
the negotiations of the proposed loan, that PLN would maintain, and have periodically inspected,
the Besai dam in accordance with sound engineering practices and procedures satisfactory to the
Bank
5.34        PLN would carry out the Environmental Action Plans in accordance with terms
agreed with the Bank during negotiations, which, inter alia, would include: (a) for the Besai plant:
(i) regular monitoring of public health; (ii) erosion rate and sedimentation; (iii) discharge of water
from the dam and its quality; and (iv) routine removal of aquatic weeds; and (b) for the
Banjarmasin plant: (i) stack emission on a continuous basis during operation of the plant to ensure
compliance with regulatory limits; and (ii) disposal of solid wastes and liquid effluent in accordance
with Indonesian national standards and the environmental guidelines agreed with the Bank.
5.35        PLN would carry out the Resettlement Plans in accordance with the terms agreed
with the Bank during negotiations, which. inter alia, would include: (a) for the Besai plant:



- 32 -
(i) providing to Project Affected Persons in accordance with their respective choice, adequate land
or cash compensation or other rehabilitation options; (ii) organizing vocational training to improve
the skills of the PAPs; and (iii) providing incentives such as credit and counselling to PAPs who
choose to engage in small business enterprises; and (b) for the Banjarmasin plant: (i) providing
residential structres for all PAPs to be displaced, ensuring that the total area of the residential
plots shall be no less than the original plots occupied by the PAPs; and (ii) pay cas.h compensation,
at replacement cost, to PAPs who may select to build the residential structure independently of
PLN. Such compensation shall be made available to the PAPs in a phased manner, linking each
payment phase to the physical progress in carrying out the resettlement.
5.36        PLN would be required to submit to the Bank monthly progress reports in the earlier
phases of the execution of the physical components of the project measurw against the time bound
implementation schedules shown in Annexes 5.4 and 5.7. Such progress reports would be sent to
the Bank within ten days after conclusion of each calendar month. After the procurement activities
are completed, quarterly reports would be submitted. Arrangements for auditing are discussed in
para. 4.13.
5.37        The monthly and quarterly reports would form the basis of Bank's monitoring of the
construction of the two power plants and the barge-mounted plant. Monitoring of the technical
assistance components would be carried out with reference to the key dates set out in Annex 5.16.
PLN would be required to submit a separate quarterly progress report, detailing progress on the
technical assistance components. Compliance with loan covenants will be monitored during each
supervision.
5.38        Banjarmasin thermal power plant would include the installation of environmental
compliance monitoring instruments, located strategically at the highest points of ground level
concentration indicated by the model study. PLN would submit to the Bank monthly reports of SO,
and NO. concentrations, as well as concentrations of particulates, as measured at strategic
monitoring points.
5.39        Quality control during equipment manufacture and testing, as well as during
construction will be exercised by the respective Engineers who have responsibility for construction
supervision. Erection Manuals for this purpose will be prepared by the Engineers to assist in
controlling the quality of the work performed by the various contractors on the project.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Operating Results and Financial Position
6.1         PLN's operating results and financial position for 1985/86 to 1992/93 are shown in
the financial statements in Annex 6.1. Prior to 1985, in the absence of ROR targets, the
Government's policy on electricity tariff pernitted PLN's operations to function at or near financial
break-even. The Government provided substantial equity contribution towards PLN's sizeable
capital investment during this period. In 1986, PLN achieved a positive rate of return (3.4 percent)
on net revalued assets and its annual self-financing ratio (SFR) was 23.0 percent. However, in
1987, PLN's financial performance deteriorated substantially (ROR of -0.2 percent and SFR of
7 percent), mainly due to the devaluation of the Indonesian currency in September 1986, price
escalation, and substantial increases in the proportion of oil-based generation in 1987 because of
drought. An average increase of about 25 percent in the electricity rates approved by the
Government, effective April 1, 1989, and subsequent increases in the rates by about 20 percent
effective August 1, 1991, and about 13 percent effective February 1, 1993, restored and improved
PLN's profitability through 1993.
6.2         PLN's operating performance varies considerably at regional levels. PLN's Java
operations, which supply electricity through an interconnected system, are largely commercially-
oriented and profitable. PLN's outside-Java operations, which are mainly small-scale and dispersed
over a large number of islands, are mostly unprofitable, and have a negative impact on PLN's
overall finances. The 1991-1992 financial statements for PLN's Java and outside-Java operations
are presented in Annex 6.1.
6.3         In 1991, PLN's Java operations generated an operating profit of Rp 934 billion (ROR
of 11.7 percent). The outside-Java operations, however, incurred an operating loss of Rp 273
billion (ROR of -7.6 percent), and thereby reduced PLN's overall operating profit to Rp 662 billion
(ROR of 5.7 percent). In 1992, the operating loss incurred by the outside-Java operations
increased to about Rp 461 billion (ROR of -10.6 percent), whereas the Java operations produced
an operating profit of Rp 1,133 million (ROR of 12.0 percent). A tariff increase of 13 percent in
February 1993 compensated (7 percentage points) for the January 1993 increase in the price for
diesel oil by 27 percent and for fuel oil by 9 percent, and enabled PLN to achieve for Java
operations the covenanted ROR targets. As most electricity generation outside-Java is oil-based,
the increases in fuel prices impacted more severely on the outside-Java operations than the Java
operations. As a result, the profitability of the outside-Java operations deteriorated substantially
in 1992.

Financial Objectives and Performance Monitoring
6.4         Under the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase II Project (Loan 3602-4NT) signed June 25,
1993), PLN was required to: (a) realize for its Java operations, in 1993/94 and each fiscal year
thereafter, an annual ROR of not less than 8 percent on the average net revalued fxed assets in
operation in Java, and (b) for its outside-Java operations, achieve a break-even situation in each
of its fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1994/95, i.e., total revenues equivalent to no less than
the sum of their (i) total operating expenses, and (ii) the amount by which debt service
requirements exceed the provision for depreciation. The principal financial objectives underlying
the revenue covenant discussed above were that PLN should realize positive annual rates of return,
meet its debt service requirements, maintain adequate liquidity, self-finance over 25-30 percent of
its annual capital expenditures, and rely mostly on borrowings to finance the balance, confining the
Government's contributions to programs that involve the socially directed activities such as rural
electrification, mainly outside-Java.
6.5         The structure of the above mentioned revenue covenants for PLN was first adopted
under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND, February 6, 1987) to set
separate financial performance targets for PLN's operations in Java and outside-Java in view of
their substantially different operating characteristics. PLN's operations in Java accounted for about
80 percent PLN's sales, and were largely commercial in nature. For these operations, an ROR
covenant was considered appropriate for measuring financial performance. PLN's outside-Java
operations, which were largely socially-oriented and geographically fragmented, had been
sustaining large operating losses. For these operations, it was considered appropriate to first bring
them to a financial break-even situation, which was targeted for 1990/91. In addition PLN was
required to carry out an action plan for efficiency improvements for all its operations, in a manner
to ensure that the break-even requirements for its operations outside-Java were achieved. It was
recognized by the Government and PLN that over a period of time the operations outside-Java
should become self-sustaining, and eventually profitable.
6.6         Since 1987, PLN's electricity tariffs have been increased three times by a total of
60 percent. During the same period, the prices (excluding transportation) of fuel oil and diesel oil
have increased in total by 20 percent and 90 percent respectively (paras. 6.1 and 6.3). Although
PLN has continued to implement the action plan for sales promotion and efficiency improvement
in the operation of a large number of isolated and scattered small systems outside Java, the resultant
cost reductions have not been sufficient to offset the substantial impact the fuel cost increases, have
had on the financial performance of the outside-Java operations where more than 50 percent of the
electricity generation is based on diesel oil. Consequently, while PLN has been able to achieve
for its Java operations the annual ROR target of at least 8 percent since 1989, it has not been able
to achieve a financial break-even for its outside-Java operations. As a consequence, the target date
had to be shifted three times, the latest to 1994, as agreed under the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase
II Project (para. 6.4).
6.7         During the processing of the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase It Project (Loan 3602-TIND)
it was recognized that the rationale of using the break-even covenant for PLN's outside-Java
operations needed to be revisited in view of the overriding impact of the increase in the price of
diesel oil on the financial performance and the continued rapid expansion of the infrastructure to
meet the projected demand growth. An assessment of the financial objectives for PLN was recently
carried out jointly with the Government and PLN in the context of three principal factors: (a) the
proposed restructuring of the organizational and regulatory famework of the power sector
including the decentralizadon and corporatization of PLN's organization and management;(b) the



- 35 -
financing structure of PLN, where the large share of Government equity contribution is not
sustainable in the future; and(c) large investment requirements of PLN,excluding those for the
envisaged private power supply (paras. 2.12-2.14). There was consensus that (i) the financial
objectives that PLN should pursue are: (a) increase resource mobilization through higher levels
of self-financing (30-35 percent) of its investment program, reduced reliance on Government equity
finance, increased borrowings, and recourse to private operators; (b) achieve adequate return on
equity capital; and (c) maintain tariffs at sound levels; and (ii) an ROR covenant covering PLN's
entire operation will be most appropriate.
6.8         It was therefore agreed to modify the existing revenue covenant. Duing the
negotiations of the loanfor the proposedproject, agreement was reached that PLN shall, from time
to time, take all such measures, satisfactory to the Bank, as shall be required to realizefor al Its
operadons, for its fiscal year 1994195 and in each fiscal year thereafter, an annual rate of return
of not less than eight percent (8 %) of its average current value of its net fixed assets in operation.
Present and Future Perforwiance
6.9         PLN's financial performance for 1992, the estimate for 1993 and projections through
1999 and related income statements for its Java and outside-Java operations are summarized in
Table 6.1. (Details are given in Annex 6.1; notes and assumptions underlying the projections are
given in Annex 6.2). In the projections, for the Java and non-Java operations the sales growth is
based on PLN's demand projections and generation expansion plans, and the investment
requirements are based on the proposed investment program to be implemented by PLN and
exclude that proposed to be implemented by private investors (paras. 2.11, 2.12 and 2.14)
6.10        The financial projections are based on compliance with the modified revenue
covenant in 1994/95 (para. 6.8). An increase in electricity tariff of 3.3 percent, effective April 1,
1994, was estimated to be required for PLN to achieve for its operations as a whole, an ROR of
8 percent in 1994/95. The GOI has informed the Bank that it has decided to raise the electricity
tariffs as required.  It considers that the most suitable opportunity for making a formal
announcement and actually implementing the tariff increase would be in the third quarter of 1994.
The GOI has confirmed that the tariff increase, at the time it would be put into effect, would be
commensurate with the requirements of the agreed revenue covenant. It has been agreed with the
GOI tw taking of all necessary measures, satisfactory to the Bank, to ensure PLl's compliance
wuith the modified covenanted ROR target in its fiscal year 1994 would be a condion of
effectiveness of the proposed loan; these measures include implementation of required increases in
electricity tariffs. To maintain the annual rates of return in subsequent years at the 8 percent level,
annual tariff increases would be required mainly to compensate for the variation in the input costs,
(e.g., fuel and inflation), except in 1995 where a tariff increase of about 17 percent is estimated
to be required to compensate also for higher fuel expenses resulting from substantially higher use
of diesel oil in that year and in 1998 to compensate for substantial increases in the cost of power
purchases from private producers (para. 2. 11). PLN's annual self-financing ratios during 1994195-
1995/96 would be about 25 percent, increasing to a 30-40 percent range on a three-year average
basis during the balance of the forecast period. These levels of self-financing reflect the fact that
instead of PLN, private producers are expected to make, large investments in generating capacity
to supply PLN (paras. 2.12-2.13). The capital structure would remain satisfactory; the debt as a
percentage of debt plus equity (excluding revaluation surplus) would rise from about 36 percent
in 1992 to about 53 percent in 1996, and thereafter remain at that level. PLN's debt service
coverage ratio would be in excess of 2.5 throughout the projection period. An existing coenant
wder Loan 3602-IND requirce that PLN may not incur any additional debt unless a reasonabk

forecast of its net revenues after expendiures for each year during the term of the debt to be
incurred shall be at least 1.5 times its projected debt service requirements. This covenant was also
agreed under the proposed project. PLN's current ratio is expected to be in the range of 1.2 to
1.4 through most of the projection period; this would provide adequate liquidity.
6.11        To avoid erosion of the real value of electricity rates over time and to ensure the
continued achievement by PLN of its financial objectives, the Government has recently decided to
introduce a mechanism for periodic (quarterly) formula-based adjustment of the electricity tariff
that would take into account changes in the input costs due to inflation, and changes in fuel prices,
power purchase price and exchange rates, with the base tariff to be adjusted from time to time to
take care of financial and efficiency objectives. The Bank considers the proposed formula
satisfactory. The Govermnent intends to implement the mechanism along with the adjustment of
the basic tariff that would be necessary to meet the requirements of the agreed revenue Covenant,
before effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 6.10).
6.12        In the financial projections, PLN's capital expenditures (including interest during
construction) are derived from the investment requirements of Rp 68,600 billion ($32,590 million)
in current prices (Annexes 2.6 and 2.7); they exclude the capital expenditures for generation
projects proposed to be implemented by private investors (para. 2.12). The financing plans
assumed in the financial projections for the REPELITA V (1989-1993) and REPELITA VI (1994-
1998) are presented and compared to that for the REPELfTA IV (1984-1988) in Table 6.2. Details
are given in Annex 6.1. In the financing plan for REPELITA V, the Government's contribution

is estimated to be 39 percent, compared to 40 percent for REPELITA IV, with the annual
contribution declining to about 25 percent in 1993, from 60 percent in 1991. PLN's own
contribution from its internal sources is estimated to increase from about 14 percent during
REPELITA IV to about 19 percent during REPELITA V, and 33 percent in REPELITA VI.
Borrowings would cover about 50 percent of financial requirements in REPELITA VI compared
to 42 percent for REPELfTA V and 46 percent for REPEL1TA IV. The self-financing levels
projected for REPEL1TA VI are higher than the levels PLN has achieved historically and largely
reflect the fact that private power projects account for substanffal investment during this period that



- 38 -
would otherwise have been carried out by PLN (para. 2.13). If PLN were to carry out all
investment during the REPELITA VI period, its contribution to investment would be about
27 percent, or about 6 percentage points lower for that period.
Tariffs
6.13        PLN's tariff schedules, which became effective February 1, 1993, comprise 24
consumer categories. For medium and large industrial consumers, large commercial consumers,
large social institutions, and for large office buildings, time-of-day pricing is in effect. The
February 1993 and earlier tariff schedules are shown in Annex 6.3.
6.14        Under the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase II Project (Loan 3602-IAD) it was covenanted
that PLN will periodically review ts long-run marginal cost (LRMC) and tariff structure, and
discuss the results of the review with the Government and the Bank. This covenant was also agreed
under the proposed project, with a modification that PLN would review its LRMC by December 31
every year, and take appropriate steps to revise the tariff structure taking into account the views
of the Government and the Bank.
6.15        The Bank has reviewed PLN's LRMC study of October 1993 for Java-Bali that
accounts for about 80 percent of PLN sales. The study indicates that PLN's average revenue
would be about Rp 163/kWh in Indonesia as a whole, and Rp 154/kWh in Java, if the tariff to each
consumer category was set at the estimated LRMC of supply in Java. PLN's average revenue of
Rp 151/kWh in Java, based on the current tariffs (effective February 1, 1993) and not including
connection fees paid by consumers, is close to the average LRMC of supply in Java. However,
cross-subsidies exist between different consumer groups. To compensate for subsidies to small
consumers, electricity prices to large consumers in Java, (industrial, commercial and residential),
ai e higher than the economic cost of supply. Despite these subsidies, the household electrification
ratio remains low at about 35 percent. High lump sum payments for the initial installation charge
coupled with fixed monthly demand charges serve as barriers to many new consumers and to
increase in consumption by existing consumers. Inplementation of key elements of the sector
policy and agenda - commercialization of PLN operations, implementation of published bulk
power purchase and supply tariffs, increased participation of the private sector in electricity supply
and distribution, and instituting a uniform regulatory framework for PLN and the private sector
- will ultimately bring about conditions under which the need for substantially reducing tariff
distortions will become unavoidable; conditions under which the Government will also find it
politically easier to allow such changes.
Overall Development Fund
6.16        Government Regulations require that 55 percent of PLN's annual net profit after
corporate income tax be set aside for "Dana Pembangunan Semesta" (DPS), or the Overall
Development Fund for which the required payment should be made to the state treasury. The GOI
has statd that its equity contributions in the past had accounted for a large share of PLN's
investments and that it would continue to make its best efforts to provide fimding to ensure that
PLN would be able to implement its investment program. Under the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase
n Project (Loan 3602-IM D), it was covenanted ta GOI will take all such actions as shall be
necessary to ensure that any transfer ofproflts Jrom PLI to the DPS shall not prevent PLNfronm
mplementing its agreed investment program. This covenant was also agreed under the proposed
project. When PLN's corporate status is changed from a "Perum" to a "Persero" (para. 3.15), it



- 39 -
would not be required to transfer a portion of its net profit to DPS, but instead it may need to make
dividend payments to its stockholders.
Financing Policy
6.17        PLN formulates its long-term investment program spanning a ten-year-horizon,
which is updated periodically. The plan is reviewed by the GOI and a five-year time-slice of it is
incorporated in the country's development plan, the next of which (REPELITA VI) is to commence
on April 1, 1994. Based on the approved framework of the five-year plan, PLN prepares an
annual plan and a budget, which is approved by the Government. In recent years, the Government
has shown a strong financial comnitment towards these plans and has taken steps to enable PLN
to implement them (para. 6.12).
6.18       An existing covenant (Loan 3602-IND) relating to the long-term aspects of PLN's
financialplanning was also agreed under the proposed project. This covenant requires, inter alia,
that, as part of its ongoing annual planning activities, PLN should prepare a rolling ten-year
financial forecast based on its proposed development plan, and also prepare for the first five years
of the forecast period a financing plan that should indicate the amount of external financing and
the appropriate mix of equity and debt, and if possible the potential sources of financing.
Technical assistance is being provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND)
is helping to strengthen the financial planning capability in PLN.
6.19       The Government proposes to continue to finance PLN's investment from three
sources, namely, PLN's internal funds, borrowings and Govermnent contributions. In view of the
large and rapidly growing investment requirements of the sector, there is a need to develop a
strategy for the long-term financing requirements of the se .itor and to define the role of PLN and
the private sector in meeting these requirements. The Cir .a Hydroelectric Phase II Project (Loan
3602-IND) provides for technical assistance to GOI f a detailed study of the various issues
involved in the long-term strategy for financing the overall investment requirements of the power
sector; the terms of reference for the study are under preparation.
6.20        PLN is authorized by its charter to borrow from local and foreign lenders and to
issue its own obligations. Until recently, PLN's local borrowings had been only from the
Government-owned Banks. By Government Regulation No. 60/192 dated September 19, 1992,
PLN has been authorized to issue bonds in stages up to a maximum amount totalling Rp 1.2
trillion, with the approval of the Minister -;¢ Finance. In September 1992, PLN issued in the
domestic capital market, the first annual tr--r . .e of such bonds amounting to Rp 300 billion, which
was oversubscribed. PLN raised a further Rp 600 billion through bond issuance in September
1993. PLN would require extension of authority to issue bonds beyond the current ceiling of
Rp 1.2 trillion, since the practice of issuing bonds is expected to continue in later years. To
support the bond issue, PLN has strengthened its treasury functions and reduced the time required
to finalize the annual financial accounts and complete their audit (para. 4.13).
6.21        In line with its policy for all State Corporations, the Government secures all foreign
borrowings on behalf of PLN and bears the foreign exchange risk. The onlending arrangements
for PLN that were formulated in 1992 under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND)
and also adopted under the last operation for PLN (Cirata Hydroelectric Phase II Project - Loan
3602-IND; June 1993), were designed to ensure that PLN bore the full cost of borrowing,
including compensating the Government for the foreign exchange risk. At that time, governmental
regulations did not permit PLN's obligations under the subsidiary loan to be denominated in foreign



- 40 -
currency. Consequently, a proxy onlending mechanism had to be developed to ensure that PLN
compensated the Government for the foreign exchange risk. A recent decree of the Minister of
Finance (No. 259/KMK.017/1993 dated February 27, 1993) regarding the onlending of foreign
loans and/or grants to healthy/very health state enterprises, permits the amount of the suasidiary
loan to be denominated in the foreign currency withdrawn and the onlending interest rate to be the
interest rate payable by the Government to the lenderplus 0.5 percent per annum. h view of the
above-mentioned decree, the onlending arrangements under the proposed project have been
modified. Any proceeds of the proposed loan that would be onlent to PLN under a subsidiary loan
agreement, would be denominated in US dollars. Repayment of the subsidiary loan would be on
the same terms and conditions as those for the repayment of the Bank loan by the Government.
The onlending interest rate would be the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus 0.5 percent per
annum. The exchange risk would be borne by PLN (para. 5.24).
Asset Revaluation
6.22        PLN's assets have been revalued periodically. The last detailed revaluation was done
in 1979 as required of all public corporations under instructions of the Ministry of Finance. The
revaluation was recorded in the books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired after
March 31, 1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September 1986, the
Government issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dated October 2, 1986, providing for the revaluation
of assets of businesses and public corporations, acquired through September 12, 1986. The
Regulation specifies the annual revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for adjusting the asset
values as of January 1, 1987. For purposes of monitoring the proposed modified revenue covenant
(para. 6.8) PLN has prepared a revaluation of its assets for 1979/80-1986/87 based on the
Regulation. The methodology used by PLN for asset revaluation is satisfactory to the Bank. A
covenant, under Loan 3602-INID, that requires PLN to revalue annually its fixed assets (including
wrk in progress and consuners' contributions) and accumulated depreciation for the purposes of
the rate of return calculations under the revenue covenant was also agreed under the proposed
project.

PROJECT JUSTICATION
Demand Growth and Need for the Plants
7.1         Besi Hydroelectric Power Plant. PLN's energy sales in its Region IV, where the
Besai hydroelectric power plant is to be located, have increased at an annual average growth rate
of 14 percent in the last decade, from 301 GWh in 1982 to 1,153 GWh in 1992. Despite this
substantial increase in supply, PLN has not been able to meet the electricity demand; by 1992, only
about 30 percent of the villages had PLN supply, and PLN had about 40,000 applicants on its
waiting list. The load forecast (para. 2.9) indicates that PLN's sales in Region IV will increase
at an annual average growth rate of about 14 percent from 1993 through the end of REPELITA
VI (1998) and about 12 percent through the end of REPELITA VII (2003), while peak demand will
increase at annual average growth rate of 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively (Annex 7.1).
7.2         The Besai hydro plant will be part of the Palembang-Lampung interconnected system
(Sumbagsel System) within Region IV. PLN's sales for the Sumbagsel system are projected to
increase at an annual average growth rate of about 17 percent through the end of REPELITA VI
and about 15 percent through the end of REPELITA VII, while peak demand will increase by about
16 percent and 14 percent, respectively (Annex 7.1). The Sumbagsel system is projected to grow
at a fibster rate than the entire Region IV, which also includes isolated diesel generating systems.
7.3         Banarmasin Thermal Power Plant. PLN's sales in its Region VI, where the
Banjarmasin thermal power plant will be located, have increased at an annual average growth rate
of 17 percent in the last decade, from 272 GWh in 1984 to 927 GWh in 1992. Nevertheless, this
region depends heavily upon captive industrial power. In 1992, PLN's installed capacity was 357
MW, with a rated capacity of 267 MW, while the captive power capacity was 600 MW, which
serves large industrial units located at considerable distances from PLN's small, fragmented grids
in this Region. By 1992, only about 30 percent of the villages were electrified, and PLN's waiting
list had about 37,000 applicants. The core plan load forecast indicates that PLN's energy sales and
peak load in Region VI will increase at an anmnal average growth rate of about 13 percent from
1993 through the end of REPEL1TA VI, and about 11 percent through the end of REPELITA VII
(Annex 7.1).
7.4         The 2 x 65 MW Banjarmasin coal-fired plant will be part of the Barito-Benua Lima
interconnected system within Region VI. PLN's energy sales and peak load for the Barito-Benua
Lima system are projected to increase at an annual average rate of about 16 percent from 1993
through the end of REPELITA VI, and about 14 percent through the end of REPEL1TA VII (2003)
(Annex 7.1).

Least Cost Option
7.5         Least cost planning. PLN used a dynamic programming model to optimize its
generation expansion plans for the Surnbagsel and Barito-Benua Linia systems over the years 1993-
2008. This model optimizes the supply plan, taking into account the projected savings from
demand management (DSM) in the load forecast. Since PLN is still in the initial stages of
formulating and testing appropriate DSM (para. 5.19), only limited savings from DSM measures
can be expected in the medium term. The input data for the generation planning model include the
core plan load forecast, a four-days-per-year loss-of-load probability (LOLP) criterion, and various
thermal, hydlro and gas turbine plants identified as potential candidates for the generation expansion
of the syst.-m.
7.6         Besai. The Besai hydro power plant was selected by the model as part of the least-
cost expansion plan. The Besai plant, with an installed capacity of 90 MW (2 x 45 MW units),
is planned to assist in meeting the peak demand of the Sumbagsel system while also providing some
base load power. Further, implementation of the Besai plant supports the energy resource
development policy of GOI (para. 1.3) which encourages the substitution of oil in the generation
of power with more economical fuels and renewable energy resources. In addition to the least-cost
generation expansion analysis, the Besai hydro plant was compared directly to a thermal alternative.
The Besai plant is expected to operate partly on base load (32 MW for 24 hours during the rainy
season), with an additional 58 MW operating daily during the 4-hour peak period. The Besai plant
therefore is validated against a conceptual thermal plant comprising 58 MW of oil-fired peaking
gas turbine capacity and 32 MW of base load coal-fired capacity. The discount rate at which the
two alternatives yield the same present value (equalizing discount rate) is 14 percent, indicating a
preference for the Besai hydro plant over the thermal alternative.
7.7         Banjarmasin.  The Banjarmasin thermal power plant has been selected as a
component of PLN's generation expansion plan for the Barito-Benua Lima system. The proposed
plant, as part of the least-cost plan for the Barito-Benua Lima system, will help PLN meet the
increasing demand for electricity in the region and assist in improving its supply reliability.
Further, the more economical base load generation provided by the Banjarmasin plant will enable
PLN to replace diesel generation in the system and thus reduce operating costs from 1998 onwards.
The Barito-Benua Lima system consists of a large number of small diesel units, with only four non-
diesel units (three hydro units and one gas turbine). Therefore, the Barito-Benua Lima system
would benefit from the addition of central generating capacity that would improve IPLN's
operational efficiency and reduce the cost of supply by taking advantage of economies of scale.
Further, the addition of non-oil based generation capacity would be the consistent with the GOI's
energy resource policy, which encourages the substitution of oil in generation (para. 1.3).

7.8        Besai. Studies carried out to determine the optimal development of the hydro
potential at Besai demonstrated that the proposed hydro plant with 90 MW (2 x 45 MW) installed
capacity is less expensive than other hydro plant configurations, such as 45 MW or 180 MW. The
generating units of the proposed hydro plant are required in 1999 to meet the projected peak
demand of 507 MW at that time.
7.9         Banjarmasin. Studies carried out during the feasibility review stage demonstrated
that the 2 x 65 MW configuration is less expensive than other configurations such as 1 x 45 MW
or 1 x 65 MW for the Banjarmasin plant. The 2 x 65 MW configuration shows substantial savings



- 43 -
in capital cost investment as a result of economies of scale, as well as substantial fuel cost savings
arising from the higher efficiency of the larger units.J/ The commissioning of the proposed
thermal plant is scheduled for 1998 as part of PLN's least-cost generation expansion plan.
7.10        Barge-mounted plants.  PLN's least-cost plan indicated that some additional
generating capacity would be needed in 1995. Given the lead time required for construction, the
Banjarmasin plant will not be commissioned until 1998. Meanwhile, power shortages are expected
to be experienced in the Barito-Benua Lima system starting from 1995. The proposed procurement
of two barge-mounted power plants of 30 MW and 10 MW respectively, is expected to mitigate
such regional power shortages. After the Banjarmasin thermal power plant is commissioned, the
barge-mounted plants are expected to be towed to other areas of power shortage in the Outer
Islands.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
7.11        Costs and Benefits. The Besai and Banjarmasin plants' economic viability has been
established by calculating an Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) on the basis of the costs and
benefits associated with the project. The plants' capital costs consist of. (i) the plant and related
equipment, including the associated transmission line from the generation facility to the
interconnected grid; the costs include physical contingencies, but exclude taxes and duties; and (ii)
the incremental transmission and distribution costs arising from the use of the network to supply
the customers with electricity generated by the plants. The transmission and distribution costs are
based on recent PLN estimates of the Long Run Average Incremental Costs (LRAIC) for
transmission and distribution. The variable costs for the Besai plant consist solely of the O&M
costs, since there are no fuel costs. The fuel costs for the Banjarmasin plant are based on the
border price of coal, adjusted for transportation costs to the mine mouth as well as for the heat
content (kcal/kg) of the lignite to be used in the power plant.
7.12        The benefits of the Besai and Banjarmasin plants have been estimated by the revenue
from the incremental electricity sales on the basis of the current average electricity tariff for Region
IV, and supplemented by the consumer surplus. In the case of industrial, commercial and public
consumers, their willingness to pay is estimated by the cost of self generation from captive diesel
plants. These costs are estimated to be typically in the range Rp 150/kWh to Rp 300/kWh,
depending upon plant scale and utilization. The analysis assumes an average willingness-to-pay of
Rp 225/kWh. With the current average industrial tariff at about Rp 132/kWh (6.27 US¢/kWh),
this yields a consumer surplus of Rp 93/kWh (4.42 USO/kWh). For residential consumers, their
consumer surplus is estimated by two components: (a) consumer surplus in the diverted market
i.e., cost savings resulting from the substitution of kerosenie by electricity for lighting, and (b) the
incremental consumer surplus in the new market i.e., the benefit of increased consumption because
of the availability of lower cost electricity. With the current average residential tariff of about
Rp 148/kWh (7.05 USCJkWh) in 1992, the components together are estimated to be 11.95
USC/kWh (Annex 7.2).
3/  Power system studies indicate tbat the tnpout of a 65 MW unit, which would represent about 38
percent of the Barito-Be  Lima system peak load in the initdal stages after the first such unit is
commsioned, culd cause system instability until the second unit comes on line. Under-frequency
relays will be installed in the system to shed loads on a progrmmable basis in the event of such a
contingency, to prevent system collapse.



- 44 -
7.13        IERR. The details of the costs, assumptions, and calculations of the IERR are
presented in Annex 7.3. The internal economic rate of return (AERR) for the Besa; hydroelectric
power plant is calculated to be 14 percent, while the IERR for the Banjarmasin plant is estimated
to be 15 percent. Sensitivity analysis indicates the following: (i) If the capital costs of the BOaW
plant increase by 10 percent, then the IERR decreases to 13 percent, or if the plants output is
delayed by one year, then the IERR decreases to 12 percent; and (;i) If the capital costs of the
Banjarmasin plant increase by 10 percent, then IERR decreases to 14 percent, or if the project's
output is delayed by one year, then the IERR decreases to 13 percent.
Project Benefits
7.14        The proposed project is designed to support the implemenation of a comprehensive
policy agenda for Indonesia's power sector and restructuring of PLN. The policy reform
underlying the project will help open the sector to private investors and restructuring of PLN will
expand the financial envelope for system expansion and enhance incentives for lowering the cost
and improving the reliability of electricity service. In addition the project wili help PLN meet
increases in demand for electricity in Sumatera and Kalimantan with improved seivice reliability.
Further, technical assisiance will help strengthen the environmental management capabilities of GOI
and PLN. As part of this program, the proposed project will seLve as a model for the expansion
of the power subsector in Sumatera and Kalimantan by setting up pilot projects in Regions IV and
VI (para. 5.19).
7.15        Specifically, the Besai hydroelectric power plant will help PLN meet increases in
the peak demand for electricity in its Region IV, provide base load power, and improve service
reliability. It will substitute oil-fired generation in the Region by a renewable energy source, and
by deferring the need for new thermal generation capacity, will have a positive impact on the
environment. The Banjarmasin thermal power plant will help PLN meet increasing demand for
electricity in its Region VI and improve service reliability. The plant will produce electriity
economically by utilizing cheap lignite as fuel that is non-tradeable and has no other commercial
value. It will also provide the necessary support for PLN to gradually substitute oil-fired
generation in the Region.
Project Risks
7.16        The major potential risk associated with the proposed project is that the GOI will fail
to implement the policy agenda in the power sector. However, this risk is minimal, in view of the
Government's excellent implementation record, and the continuing dialogue and cooperation
between the Bank and the GOI. The technical risks associated with the Besai hydroelectdc power
plant and the Banjarmasin thermal plant are minimal. he project management and implemenation
risks will be kept to a minimum by ensuring the appointment of qualified civil works contcors
for the main physical componem through prequalification processes and the use of experienced
international consultants for design and construction supervision, coupled with the appointment of
experienced project managers and time bound project implementation schedules, with key milestone
dates. There is littde risk that the power generation components of the proposed project would
become redundant if the projected levels of electricity demand fai to materalize, since these
components are part of PLN's core expansion program. There is no risk of redundancy associated
with the barge-mounted power plants, since they can be moved to help alleviate regional power
shortages wherever they arise.

- 49 -                          ANNEX 1.1
IDONESIA
SumaT  AND KmAMANAN PowER ftojECr
Seetor Overview
Fossil Fue)s
1.          Oil. Indonesia's proven and potential reserves of oil have been estimated to be
about 11 billion barrels as of January 1992, of which proven reserves are estimated to be 6 billion
barrels. The production of crude oil and condensates in 1992 was about 551 million barrels, which
implies a reserves-to-production ratio of 20:1. The World Bank's medium term projections indicate
that whereas in volume terms Indonesia would still appear to be a comfbrtable net exporter of oil
through this decade, in value terms it could become a net oil importer well before the end of this
century. The major reasons for the decline are the rapid growth in domestic product demands and
the growing importation of such petroleum products, as well as the cost recovery and factor service
payments which have to be made to oil contractors.
2.          The Bank's participation in the development of the oil sector has been primarily
through its dialogue on energy pricing issues. The Bank has been advocating the use of efficiency
pricing as the basic guideline for detrmining petroleum product prices under Indonesia's
administered pricing approach. An appropriate guideline for adjusting domestic fuel prices is the
world market price for refined petroleum products with selective departures from this benchmark
for revenue and equity reasons. President Suharto's Budget Speech in January 1993, emmciated
the principle that energy should be treated "as an ordinary commodity with the going price at tLe
international market", and in the price adjustments announced shortly thereafter, the Government
has raised overall product prices by about 24 percent, and eliminatd the overall subsidy that
existed prior to the increase. With these increases in product prices, only kerosene retains a
sizeable subsidy, equivalent to about 30 percent of its efficiency price. All other product prices
are at or above international price levels, with an implicit tax on gasoline to finance the cross-
subsidy on kerosene.
3.          Natural Gas. Indonesia's indicative geological reserves of natural gas are estimated
to be about 217 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 91 TCF are classified as proven, and 39 TCF
classified as potential reserves. Among the proven and potential reserves there are about 8.4 TCF
recoverable reserves in structures too small to support LNG exports, but large enough to be
exploited for the domesteic market. It is estimated that further exploration could result in the
addition of 4 to 15 TCF to this category. The current gross natral gas production is about 2.58
TCF (461 million boe), implying a reserve-to-production ratio of 35:1, which is high by
international standards.
4.          Production of LNG exports continue to rise, responding to strong demand in the Far
East. In 1991, LNG exports were valued at about US$3.8 billion (export volume of 19 million
tons), and represented about 81 percent of total sales, with only 20 percent going to the domestic
market, mainly in fertilizer, iron and steel, and cement production. LNG demand in Japan, Korea,
and Taiwan is projected to expand in the 1990s by about 30-40 mfllion tons, and Indonesia expect
to have a significant share of that market. Over the longer term, as oil's share of export revenues



-50-                            ANNEX 1.1
decline, the Government's expectation is that natural gas exports will compensate for the revenue
losses.
5.          Notwithstanding the actual and projected growth of the LNG export markets, the
use of natural gas for domestic energy consumption is becoming economically more attractive.
Domestic consumption of gas is projected to increase from 0.3 TCF in 1990 to over 1.0 TCF by
the year 2000. The largest increase in domestic gas consumption is projected to take place in the
power sector, to supply combined-cycle plants that represent a major element of the strategy to cut
back on oil-based generation. Plans call for increasing the share of natural gas-fired generation
to about 22 percent by the end of this decade (195 BCF), from 5 percent in 1991 (26 BCF).
6.          The Government's strategy is to meet the projected domestic gas requirements by
developing the non-exportable gas reserves and the necessary gas transmission infrastructure. The
Bank has recently completed a 'Natural Gas Development Planning Study" which provides an in
depth assessment of the issues and formulates a development strategy for the efficient domestic use
of the resource. The findings of the study were reviewed with the Government in June 1992.
Bank loans are also helping to finance Gas Distribution (Loan 2690-IND) and Gas Utilization (Loan
3290-IND) projects.
7.          Coal. Indonesia's coal reserves are estimated to exceed 32 billion tons, located
prim3rily in Sumatera (23 billion tons) and Kalimantan (9 billion tons). The "measured reserves'
are 4.2 billion tons, divided nearly equally between Sumatera and Kalimantan.
8.          Indonesia's annual production of coal has increased substantially from about 600,00
tons in 1983 to over 15 million tons in 1992. Coal production is expected to exceed 30 million
tons by 1994 and could reach 50 million tons by 2000. Thus the ratio of measured reserves to
annual production is about 280:1. About 60 percent of the production at present comes from
Sumatera and the remaining amount from Kalimantan. Besides one state enterprise, a dozen
foreign contractors share in joint ventures aad in further exploration and mining activities.
9.          In general Indonesian coal has low sulfur, low ash, high moisture, and high volatile
matter. The South Sumatera and Kalimantan coals have the potential for sustaining the large coal-
fired power generation program in the country that has been identified as part of the least-cost
expansion plan for the power sector. Under this plan, coal's share of power generation will
increase from about 30 percent in 1991 ( about 5 million tons) to about 50 percent in 1999 (23
million tons). In addition to increasing domestic consumption, exports of coal are also being
developed, and Indonesia could become a significant coal exporter in the coming years. In 1991,
coal exports reached about 6.0 million tons and an export capability of about 20 million tons is
expected by 1994.
Geothermal
10.         The geothermal reserves of Indonesia are estimated at 10,000 MW, of which
5,500 MW is on Java. The first geothermal power plant with a capacity of 30 MW was built in
1976 at Kamojang near Bandung in West Java. The expansion of this plant to 140 MW was funded
by the Bank Loan 2214-IND. This geothermal field has potential for further expansion by 55 MW.
Two more power stations in Java, totalling 165 MW, are being constructed by PLN with financial
assistance from the Italian Govermnent and the ADB respectively.



- 51-                           ANNEX 1.1
I.         The main issue in the exploitation of geothermal potential is to locate sites that can
be developed at costs competitive with other options. In lava, where the electricity grid is well
developed and where PLN is able to achieve economies of scale by constructing large coal-fired
or combined cycle gas-fired stations, the geothermal option is not competitive at the current fuel
prices. However, in the outer islands, where the cost of the alternatives are high, geothermal
development would have greater justification. PLN and GOI have, therefore, directed their
priorities to developing geothermal sites outside Java.
Hydropower
12.         Indonesia has considerable hydroelecric resources, but their development to date
has been limited by their geographic distribution relative to the load centers where there is demand
for electricity. The greatest potential (over 35 percent) lies in Irian Jaya, which has less than one
percent of total electricity demand, while Java, which accounts for 80 percent of current electricity
consumption, has less than 10 percent of the total potential. In Java, about 2,000 MW of hydro
potential has been already developed, including two major projects viz. Saguling (750 MW) and
Cirata (500 MW) funded by Bank Loans 1950-IND and 2300-IND. The proposed project will add
500 MW of capacity to the existing Cirata project. Hydroelectric plants outside lava totalling about
2,000 MW are also currently under either planning or implementation.
Nuclear
13.         Development of nuclear power in Indonesia has a lower priority compared to power
generation using natural gas and coal. However, in the long-term, when coal usage for power
generation becomes large enough to cause environmental concerns and when suitable sites for
locating coal-fired plants become difficult to find, nuclear technology could provide a viable
alternative.  The need for a nuclear power plant is not envisaged until year 2005.   The
Government has recently commissioned a feasibility study for a nuclear plant. This study will
determine the opportune timing for the first nuclear power plant and also recommend an
appropriate technology.
Environment
14.         Environmental issues in the energy sector arise from coal mining and power
generation from coal fired, oil fired, geothermal and hydroelectric plants. It has been customary
to prepare detailed environmental impact studies for all projects funded by the Bank loans.
However, energy projects funded by different agencies do not follow a uniform policy in respect
of environmental standards. The Indonesian standards are not fully developed and the capability
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy for preparing such standards is limited. Also, the Ministry
does not have trained manpower or equipment to monitor and enforce environmental regulations
in operating facilities. To assist in overcoming this shortcoming, technical assistance was provided
under Loan 3098-IND (Paiton Thermal Power Project) which trained a number of staff of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy on environmental management, and provided documentation for
environmental guidelines and monitoring (para. 1.4). The TA was satisfactorily completed in
October 1992. The proposed project includes technical assistance to the Bureau of Environment
and Technology under the Ministry of Mines and Energy for strengthening its environmental
management capability in the mining sector and to PLN for strengthening its capacity to undertake
environmental studies and improve its management and monitoring practices (para. 5.21).

Ministry of Mines and Energy
GOALS AND POLICEES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE ELECTRIC POWER SUB-SECTOR
BackUround
Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the future development of the energy sector are
described in the Outlines of State Policy (Garis-Garis Besar Haluan Negara or GBHN)
promulgated by the Peoples' Consultative Assembly (MPR) in March 1993 to guide the
formulation of the Sixth Medium-Term (Five-Year) Year Development Plan (REPELITA VI)
and Second Stage Long-Term (Twenty-Five Year) Development Strategy (PJPT-II). The GBHN
highlights the importance for Indonesia's sustained economic and social development of meeting
its rapidly growing energy needs efficiently--including through conservation and diversification
of primary energy sources and their more efficient utilization--and of minimizing the adverse
environmental and social impacts of energy use. In the electric power sub-sector, the GBHN
recognizes that an adequate, reliable and reasonably priced electricity supply is essential for the
country's continuing development, emphasizing its role in serving the needs of other productive
sectors and in contributing directly to improving the living standards of the people.
T=he recent development of Indonesia's power sub-sector is characterized by very rapid
growth in the demand for electricity and in the total capacity of the public power supply. Over
the last 15 years, the generating capacity owned and operated by the sole state-owned power
utility, Perum Listrik Negara (PLN). has increased from about 900 MW in 1975/76 to about
11,000 MW in 1992/93. Over this same period, the number of customers served by PLN has
grown by thirteen times. These impressive achievements have been made possible by the
continuing institutional development of PLN, and by a strong commitment on the part of
Government to ensuring that PLN obtained the necessary financial and other resources.
However, the very rapid pace of growth of power demand since the mid-1980s,
attributable to the success of the Government's economic policies, has--when coupled with the
country's archipelagic geography--posed challenges that have exceeded PLN's evolving
capacities. Thus while extensive power grids serve most areas of Java and Bali, the coverage
and quality of electricity supply in the outer islands generally remains very low while costs
remain stubbornly high. Moreover, even in Java and Bali, the rapid growth in industrial demand
for power has outstripped PLN's ability to supply, with the result that the capacity of privately-
owned autogeneration plant is now equivalent to around 30% of PLN's installed capacity. The
Government recognizes that the challenges confronting the power sub-sector will necessarily
intensify in the coming plan periods, and that this in turn will necessitate changes to the policies
that have guided its development in the past.

Policy Goals for REPELITA VI and PJPT-H
During REPELITA VI and PIPT-II the Government's policies for the electric power sub-
sector will be designed to:
(a)   improve  the  performance  of PLN, notably  through  decentralization,
commercialization and corporatization;
(b)   structure electricity tariffs so as to reflect more closely the economic costs of
supply;
(c)   reform and refne the regulatory and institutional framework so as to foster
competition and facilitate increased and more efficient private sector participation;
(d)   enable equal access to primary energy sources at market-determined prices for
publicly and privately owned power generators; and
(e)   develop and implement appropriate measures for inducing energy conservation
and improving environmental protection.
The broad policies for achieving these goals have been established as part of the process of
formulating REPELITA VI and are outlined below.
nmproving PLN's Performance
The Government recognizes that improving the efficiency and quality of PLN's services
and equipping it to respond effectively to continuing rapid growth in demand for power will
necessitate significant changes to its present organization structure and corporate strategy. These
changes, which will be implemented in a number of carefully planned stages, will entail:
Decentralization: PLN's organization and management processes will be restructured and
decentralized so as to establish profit centers along functional (generation, transmission,
distribution) and geographical lines. Managers of profit centers will be given expanded and
more clearly defined decision-making responsibilities, and will be made accountable for their
performance. A system of contract-based objectives and incentives will be established to
encourage improvements in the operational performance of profit centers.
Commercialization: PLN will be required to function as a commercially oriented enterprise,
with individual profit centers planning and managing their activities in accordance with sound
commercial principles. Cross-subsidy between commercial and non-commercial businesses will
be phased out, with Govermnent providing explicit subsidies on a transparent basis for rural
electrificatior. and other social programs that are carefully targeted to benefit low income groups
or regions. The sub-sector regulatory and institutional framework will be enhanced, inter alia
to prevent exploitation of monopoly powers (see below).



- 67 -                          ANNEX 31
Corporatization: PLN's corporate status and structure will be amended to reflect and reinforce
these initiatives and to enable it to compete on an equal basis with private power enterprises.
The present Perum entity will be converted progressively into a group of profit-oriented limited
liability companies (Perseros); these will be empowered to raise funds on the capital markets,
and private participation in their ownership will be sought as soon as their financial performance
permits. Such state-owned companies will be expected to compete in a market-oriented
envirorunent, with Government exercising strategic control over them on an "arm's length" basis
through performance contracts that specify clear objectives and efficiency indicators.
Restructuring Tariffs
The Government's policies on electricity tariffs are designed, inter alia, to ensure the
sustainable sound fmancial health of the power sub-sector and, in particular, its capacity to
respond effectively to the rapid growth in demand for electric power. As a first step towards
enabling PLN to play an expanded role in financing the needed massive investments in new and
replacement capacity, the average sales tariff will be increased to enable it to achieve at least
an 8% overall rate of return on revalued assets; this is expected to result in a self-financing ratio
of 30-35% for the period 1994-1999. To avoid erosion over time of the real value of the power
tariff, rates will be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the costs of supply, with the
mechanism adopted being designed to promote efficiency improvements and tight control of
costs.
The present sales tariff structure will be simplified and the distortions inherent in it will
be progressively reduced so as to enable rates to reflect better the costs of supply. As part of
this process, the uniform national tariff policy will be reassessed during REPELITA VI with a
view to its replacement by a system of two or more regional tariffs. Cross-subsidies between
businesses and between consumer categories will be progressively phased out and replaced by
a transparent system of explicit Government subsidies for social programs or services that benefit
carefully targeted low income groups.
To facilitate increased private participation in the power sub-sector, the Government will
require PLN quickly to establish and publish rates for the purchase of power from small
generators through standard forms of contract, and to establish tariffs for the bulk supply of
power to distribution enterprises. The Government is currently examining mechanisms and
conditions for enabling "third party access" to PLN transmission grids, and intends that PLN
should introduce a tariff for "power wheeling".
Reforming the Regulatory Framework and Promoting Private Participation
The Gov-rnent is committed to expanding quickly private sector participation in the
power sub-sector, both to complement PLN's efforts to meet rapidly growing power demands
and to promote healthy competition that will produce improvements in efficiency and standards
of service.. It recognizes that this will require, on the one hand, a transparent, comprehensive
and consistent regulatory framework to define the -ules under which state-owned and private
power enterprises will operate, and, on the other, an independent agency to oversee the
operation of these regulations and, in particular, to ensure that the natal monopoly elements



-68 -                          ANNEX 3.2
of the system are managed in a manmer consistent with the public interest. The oversight agency
will be responsible for ensuring that regulations are administered and applied in a transparent,
timely, and consistent manner, and will be required and empowered to deal with appeals relating
to their implementation.
During 1994, the Government will review the current legal and regulatory framework
for the power sector and plans to formulate the revisions and additions that are needed to secure
the above goals. It will also initiate the establishment of a regulatory oversight agency under
the Ministry of Mining and Energy by separating those functions that relate to power sector
policy and planning from those that relate to the power industry's regulation and oversight. As
a first step, a separate Directorate of Regulation will be created within the Directorate General
of Electric Power and Energy Development. This will subsequently be converted to a higher
level agency with greater powers and independence.
The Government is currently refining its strategy for securing private participation in the
sub-sector, and is strengthening its procedures and capacities for promoting, evaluating, and
negotiating proposals from private entities. While the initial efforts in this area have focused
on the solicitation of proposals for large Build-Own-Operate (BOO) power generation projects,
the existing regulatory framework permits a much broader spectrum of private participation and
considerable attention is now being devoted to exploring other opportunities. Unsolicited
proposals for BOO generation projects are being encouraged, and several are now in preparation
under Letters of Preliminary Approval. Arrangements for permitting small independent power
generators to sell electuicity to PLN at published tariffs through standard forms of contract are
being developed and will be finalized shortly. These arrangements are expected encourage more
efficient use of existing autogeneration capacity and to promote development of cogeneration
capacity by industrial plants.
Active consideration is now also being given to expanding the role of private enterprises
and cooperatives in the distribution / supply function, and to permitting private participation in
the shortly-to-be-corporatized elements of PLN. In addition, the Government intends also to
require PLN to provide 'third party access" to its transmission grids for independent power
producers. The conditions and charges for such access will be clearly defmed and their
implementation will be monitored by the regulatory oversight agency.
Enabling Equal Access to Prinmar Ener=v Sources
The Government recognizes that success in securing efficient private participation in large
scale power generation will be contingent on intending private power enterprises being able to
enjoy the same access to and prices for primary energy as are enjoyed by PLN. Accordingly
it intends to review and, where necessary, to revise its current policies in these areas,
particularly with respect to natural gas and geothermal steam, so as to make the markets for
primary energy resources open and transparent.



-69 -                         ANNEX 3.2
Promoting Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection
Energy conservation is a central theme of the Government's energy policies, and it is
recognized that the appropriate pricing of primary energy and of electric power as outlined above
will play a key role in promoting the economically efficient use of scarce resources. The
Government's commitrnent to such pricing policies is reflected in the statement of the President,
made in January 1993, concerning the principles that will in future govern the pricing of refied
oil fuels for supply to the domestic market. It recognizes, however, that the proper pricing of
energy products will need to be complemented by other initiatives and measures designed to
encourage and induce sound energy use decisions, particularly on the part of industrial,
conmnercial, and transport enterprises.  In the power sub-sector, the Govermnent is now
developing a strategy for encouraging the more efficient utilization of electricity and the
implementation of this strategy will be accorded high priority during REPELITA VI.
Encouraging conservation and diversification in the use of energy resources is an
important element in the Government's strategy for reducing the adverse environmental and
social impacts of energy consumption. More generaly, the Government recognizes that
safeguarding the environment is a prerequisite for sustainable development, and accordingly has
put in place the regulatory framework and institutions needed to achieve this.  During
REPELITA VI, considerable attention and resources will be directed to ensuring that these
regulations are implemented as intended. Within the electric power sub-sector, attention will
be focused on the careful planning and design of new generation, transmission and distribution
facilities so as to minimize and mitigate their impacts on the natural environment and adjacent
communities, and on effective monitoring designed to ensure proper compliance with applicable
standards and practices.
Implementation
The Government will implement the above policies through a comprehensive and
carefully phased medium-term action plan whose preparation is being coordinated by the
Ministry of Mines and Energy. Other concerned institutions and agencies, most notably
representatives of the People's Representative Assembly and the Ministry of Finance, are being
consulted on those aspects of the action plan that extend beyond the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy. The action plan is conceived as an integral component of Ministry's
strategy for the development of the energy sector during REPELITA VI, and it is therefore
intended that its key elements will be finalized by the end of 1993.

SUMATERA AND KALMANTAN POWER PROJECT
BESA  HYDROELECRIC POWER PLANT
Location
The Besai hydroelectric power plant is to be located in the upper reaches of the Besai
river, a tributary of the Tulangbawang river which is one of three major rivers in the Lampung
province of South Sumatera, draining into the lava Sea. The project is designed as a run-of-river
type development, with a daily regulating storage capacity. The installed capacity of the plant will
be 90 MW, with two generating units of 45 MW each.
The proposed intake dam is located at the entrance of the Besai gorge. The elevation
of the crest of the dam will be 9 m only above the river bed, and will provide about 245m fall in
a distance of 6 km between the dam and the power house. Ninety-five percent of the dependable
firm discharge of 8.3 m3/sec will be harnessed to produce an annual energy of 367 GWh.
Geology
The geological exploration carried out thus far for this project component includes:
(a) mapping and analysis of major regional geological features; (b) detailed surface mapping of the
project area: (c) execution and logging of sample bore holes; and (d) exploration adits into the
proposed headrace tunnel, surge tank, penstock and tailrace tunnel. The project area consists of
volcanic products, mainly composed of tuff breccia associated with tuff and andesite lava. Base
rock of the dam site is tuff breccia in both banks. Headrace tunnels will be driven through tuff
breccia for almost the entire length. Favorable tunneling conditions are expected, with temporary
support limited to shotcrete and bolting. For the large diameter surge shafts, rock conditions are
similar to the headrace tunnel, with some andesite in the upper parts. Favorable rock conditions
in three kinds of layers, such as andesite, tuff breccia and acidic tuff, are also expected in the
penstock and tailrace tunnels. Again, support would be limited to shotcrete and bolting except near
the tailrace portals, where consolidation work and heavier support are expected. Base rock of the
power house site is fresh acidic tuff,
Physiography and Hydrology
The catchment area of the intake damsite is 415 km2. The dam is located at the
entrance of the Besai gorge. The river has a gentle slope around the damsite, continues for about
100m in the downstream reach of the dam axis, and then slopes steeply for about 4 km toward the
proposed power house site. Then it changes again to a gentle slope for about 2 km. The riverbed
at the proposed damsite is 15 m wide. Behind the left bank of the intake damsite, there are low
lying hills; the right bank forms a steep slope to the top of about 200 m high hill. The headrace
tunnel will be driven through ridges running along the left bank of the river. The surge tank is
located on a berm excavated in the escarpment inclining toward the power house. The undulating
topography continues along the proposed route of the penstock. The power house will be located
at the foot of a gentle hill on the left bank of the Besai river.



- 73 -                          ANNEX 5.1
The climate around the project area is maritime tropical, hot and humid with an
average rainfall of about 2,550 mm. The average flow in the river is estimated at 8.3 mtesec, with
largest flood discharge of 140 n9'sec recorded in 1988. Design flood for the intake damsite is
determined as a probable flood discharge of 800 m&/sec with a probability of occurring once in 100
years. With additional safety margins, design flood for each structure is as follows:
Extraordinary Flood
Structure           2 years    100 years             10,000 years
Intake Dam                -         800 m31s              1,400 m3/s
Power House               -         820 m3/s              1,435 m3/s
River Diversion        240 m3/s
Sedimentation
The Besai river carries a considerable volume of sediments, particularly during the high
flow season. Sediment control upstream of the proposed dam includes such measures as soil management
through better agricultural practices, terracing, and planting. In addition, the project will provide for:
(a) periodic flushing of the reservoir; (b) retention of sediments in the desilting basins; and (c) selection
and specification of equipment to minimize wear and off-time maintenance. The project authorities would
monitor during the early years of operation the performance of the sediments handling provisions.
A scouringway, with two upper and two lower gates, will be installed at the dam to flush
out bed loads of sedimentation through the lower scouring gates, and suspended loads through the upper
ones. The size of the scouringway is designed to ensure the same scouring capacity as the existing river.
Construction Materials
Two prospective quarry sites have been identified for the project. One is about 13 km
from the project area, the other is 1 kn downstream of the Besai river from the power station. The rock
in the first quarry is basalt, with an estimated volume of 97,000 mn, while the rock in the other quarry
is andesite, having an estimated volume of 84,000 mn. Physical and chemical properties of both quarries
satisfy international standards in terms of specific gravity, absorption, abrasion and alkali reactivity
characteristics.
Design Features
Intake Dam: The intake dam comprises the sluiceway, the scouringway and the two
abutments. The sluiceway is designed as a gated concrete overflow weir, 33.5 m wide, 25.2 m long and
6.5 m high, fitted with four sluice gates. Downstream of the sluiceway, the horizontal stilling basin is
33.5 m wide and 16 m long to dissipate the energy of design flood equivalent to 100 years probable peak
discharge. The scouringway is 16.5 m wide and 25.4m long, fitted with two upper and two lower gates,
each 6 m wide and 1.5 m high.
Intake Facilities: The intake facility, laid out on the left bank of the river, is composed
of an intake, a sand trap basin and the inlet to the headrace tuel. The intake is designed to be 13.8 m
wide and 10.1 m high to keep inflow velocity less than 1 m/sec for the maximum plant discharge of 45.6
m3/sec, and to minimize the inflow of trash and sediments into the intake. Ihe two intake gates are each
3.8 m wide and 6.1 m high. The sand trp basin between the intake and the headrace tunnel is 39.4 m
wide and 60.3 m long, with an overflow spillway 40 m long. The inlet of the headrace tunnel is 7.6 m



- 74 -                          ANNEX 5.1
wide and 10.1 m high, and designed to prevent air entrainment by assuring adequate water cover at the
sill level of the inlet.
The pressurized headrace tunnel is reinforced concrete, about 4.9 km long, with a circular
section of 4.3 m inside diameter. Three work adits, with a total length of 790 m are provided for
construction use. The most downstream work adit will be used for draining water from the headrace
tunnel during maintenance.
The surge tank is restricted orifice type, with an upper chamber at the end of the headrace
tunnel. It is a pressurized concrete surge tank consisting of a prestressed concrete upper chamber, 13 m
inside diameter and 50.6 m high above ground, and a reinforced concrete shaft, 2.5 m inside diameter
and 44.7 m high.
The penstock is underground, steel-lined, 3.4 m inside diameter and 610 m long. It
bifurcates about 31.5 m before entering the power house for the two hydraulic turbines. A work adit is
provided about 140 m upstream of the power house entrance.
The power house comprises a main building furnished with two hydrauic turbine generator
units, each capable of generating 45 MW. The tailrace, discharging back into the Besai river, is a 23 m
wide, 50 m long, and 21m high open concrete channel. The 150 kV switchyard comprising conventional
switchgear, is located behind the power house.
Environmental Aspecs
The environmental impacts of this project component is minor for the following reasons:
(a) the power plant is a run-of-the-river facility; (b) the dam and the reservoir are located at the bottom
of a deep gorge, and many of the structures will be built underground; (c) the dam itself is only 9 m
high, and the pondage is comparatively small; and (d) since the river is at the bottom of .^ gorge, few
people ever approach the river and fewer live near it. The 6 km stretch between the dam and the power
house is uninhabitated. PLN will, however, maintain a constant discharge of water from the dam of
about I m3/sec to prevent the river bed from the dam to the power house from drying up. Ihe effect of
concentrating flows will be insignificant on existing riverine and lacustrine environments. Environmnital
management, therefore, is primarily during the constructionperiod with appropriateprovisions included
in the bid documents for such aspects as: erosion control for access roads and temnorary works, disposal
of unnel excavation muck and other spoil in existing disposal areas, potable water supply, waste disposal,
health and amenities in contractors' temporary camps and facilities. A detailed Environmental
Assessment Summary is given in Annex 5.3.
The total area to be acquired for the purpose of constructing this project is about 202 ha,
out of which about 140 ha will be inundated, while the rest (62 ha) will be required for the dam, power
house, office complex and housing colony, contractors' use and access roads. 129 families will need to
be resettled under the plan, parts of whose land will be acquired for the development; however, no
physical relocation is involved in any of these cases. Public consultations have been held in the project
area, with NGO participation, and the Project Affected Persons (PAP) are satisfied with the resettlement
plan presented by PLN. Some 35 percent of the PAPs have exercised the land for land option. PLN is
committed to providing equivalent land to all of those who have asked for it. The rest of the PAPs have
opted for assistance to be able to engage in small business enterprises, improve their own housing, or
purchase consumptive products. PLN wil provide appropriate counselling and credit facilities for the
business entrepreneurs, in addition to arranging for vocational training in regional instions for those
who are interested in it. Qualified PAPs will also be eligible for work in the construction of the project.
A Resettlemet Plan in respect of this project component is included in Annex - 5.3; PLN wi1l be the



- 75 -                          ANNEX 5.1
implementing agency for the plan and has made appropriate budget provisions for the same. The Bank
has reviewed the plan and found it acceptable.
Jrnple tation
Construction A'rangements. PLN has appointed a project manager for overseeing the
implementation of the hydroelectric plant. Engineering, design and construction supervision have been
assigned to experienced international consultants with local associates. The consultants have been
appointed in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants. The construction
organization will be modelled on that successfully employed for the Saguling and Cirata projects. The
project will be implemented over a period of six years. The generating units are expected to be
commissioned by December 1999.
Dam Safety and Instrumentation Monitoring. PLN has several dams which are
categorized as large dams under the ICOLD definition, including the 99 m high Saguling and 125 m high
Cirata rockfill dams. Under the Cirata II hydroelectric project (Loan 3602-IND), strengthening of
PLN's dam safety procedures and training of PLN staff in dam safety inspections and instrumentation
monitoring, are being facilitated through appropriate technical assistance.
Water Rights
The Bank is satisfied that the project will not result in any adverse effects on the quality,
quantity or the time-distribution of water flows downstream of the proposed dam. The project does not
cause any upstream flooding because the weir gates have been designed for a maximum flood discharge
capacity with a probability of occurring once in 100 years (para 3.2). Also, the project authorities are
committed to maintaining a steady discharge of I m3/sec from the dam to prevent the 6 km stretch of
rivet between the dam and the power house, as well as downstream of the power house itself, from
drying up.
Status of Preparation
Engineering Consultants (Nippon Koei) are already appointed; preliminary engineering for
this component has been completed under the Cirata I Hydroelectric Project (Loan 3602-IND).

SUMATERA ANDKALMAMAN POWM PROJ
BAmAwAsNTnRmAPOwER PANT
Loation
The proposed project will be located about 12 km inland from the coastal area of
South Kalimantan, in the village of Asam Asam in the Jorong Subdistrict. The project covers an
area of about 110 ha. The project site is bounded to the west by the Asam Asam river, to the
nort. by the Baru river, a tributary of Asam Asam, to the east by a secondary forest and tall grass
field, and to the south by another tributary of Asam Asam. The project site mvostly occupies forest
areas and swampy land; only a small part to the west occupies abandoned rice fields a'nd upland
areas. The land will support an ultimate capacity of 660 MW, with 4 x 65 MW and 4 x 100 MW
generating units, including the coal storage and ash disposal facilities, staff housing colony,
electrical substation and administrative office buildings. A saw mill is located next to the project
site.
Design Parameters
The commercial dates of operation of the power plant are scheduled as follows:
Unit I                  December, 1998
Unit 2                  March, 1999
The power plant will use about 460,000 tonnes of coal per year, operating at 70%
capacity factor. When all 8 units are built to the full plant capacity of 660 MW, the plant would
be consuming about 2.5 million tonnes of coal per year. The coal will be transported initially by
coal trucks over a distance of about 5 km, but in the next phase of development, the transportation
of coal would be over belt conveyors or an aerial ropeway system.
The turbine steam conditions will be 87 bars and 510' C. The steam, after driving
the. turbine, will exhaust into a condenser, operating at a pressure of 65 mm Hg, based on a cooling
water design temperature of 280 C. The condensate is pumped back through a number of feed
water heaters into the boiler. The condenser is cooled by water from a cooling tower that
recirculates between the tower and the condenser. The cooling tower will need about 10 percent
makeup water to account for evaporation and other losses.
Units 1 and 2 will have a nominal capacity of 65 MW each. Many units in this size
range have been manufactured all over the world; they have proven track record of satisfactory
performance. Each turbine generator will have five feed water heaters, including a deaerating
heater. The boiler feed pumps will be motor driven. Each generator will be air cooled, and will
have its own, brushless excitation system. Generator transformers will be naturally cooled and
located outside the turbine house.
The boilers will use pulverized coal as primary fuel, and light diesel oil mainly for
start up purposes. Located adjacent to a coal mine, the boilers will burn lignite having about 4,000



- 80 -                           ANNEX 52
kcal/kg heat value, 37 percent volatiles, 35 percent moisture, 3 percent ash and about 0.23 percent
sulfur. Each boiler will use 4 pulverizers. The boilers will be capable of operating at rated steam
conditions upto 30 percent load on light oil. Fuel oil will also be used for flame stabilization when
using excessively wet coal and/or at low loads.
Ash handling will be done with the help of drag link conveyors. The amount of ash
generated will be comparatively small because of the characteristics of the lignite having only
3 percent ash content. Ash generation per day will approximate 38 tonnes, of which 30 tonnes will
be in the form of fly ash. Electrostatic precipitators will be designed for 99.7 percent collection
efficiency. The ash will be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner, one of the
options being hauling it back to the coal mines for land reclamation.
nnstrmentation and Controls
A microprocessor based distributed control system will be used. Display of plant-
specific equipment status and operating parameters on CRTs installed in the main control room,
will facilitate real-time interface between the operators and various plant systems. Data loggers
and sequence of events recorders will automatically record plant performance at periodic intervals,
and display operating problems as they occur, on a first-out basis.
Fire Protection
The fire protection system wIll primarily comprise a wet hydrant system supported
by high pressure local spray systems, in addition to fuxed and portable gas and powder systems as
warranted by specific plant areas and equipment. The whole of the fire piping system will be kept
charged and pressurized at all times. The fire pump will automatically start up in the event of a
fall in system pressure whenever the fire fighting system is used.
Water Treatment
The plant will use some quantities of fresh water to service the requirements for:
-     Steam cycle make up
-     Cooling tower make up
-     Fire fighting systems
-     Domestic use
The required water treatment facilities will include a pretreatment plant for the raw
water, which may be drawn from the river or from underground aquifers, to remove salinity, silt
burden, organic content, as necessary. While raw water can be used for fire fighting purposes, the
pretreated water will be used for cooling tower make up, or for domestic use after appropriate
chlorination. The water for boiler make up will be demineralized.
Black Start System
To serve the requirement for supplying power needed during the construction and
plant commissioning stages, to maintain a black start capability in an emergency in the event the
plant gets isolated from the electrical trassmission system, a gas turbine of about 4 MW rating will
be installed.

Enironmental Issues
Annex- 5.6 serves to provide the detailed environmental issues associated with the
proposed Banjarmasin Thermal Power Plant. Because of the very low sulfur in the coal, it has
been determined by stack plume dispersion modeling that no flue gas desulfurization will be
necessary at this plant even when it is built to its ultimate capacity of 660 MW. Low NO,, burners
will be used in the boilers to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Altogetner 36 families will need to
be resettled due to land acquisition.

Besai Hydroelectric Power Plant
Introduction
1.          Pursuant to the objectives of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to improve the
welfare of the population and to support the growth of economic activity by meeting the electricity
requirements in an efficient and reliable manner, the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) has
proposed to construct a hydroelectric power plant at Besai, in the Lampung province of South
Sumatera, under the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project. The proposed loan will be made
to the GOI. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to PLN, which is .,sponsible for the
implementation of the project. The project is likely to be cofinanced by Austria and Australia, for
the turbine generator and transmission components. GOI/PLN will meet the financing gap from
their own internal resources.
2.          The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for the
electricity subsector of Indonesia. The subsector comprises: (i) PLN, the State Electricity
Corporation; (ii) captive plants; (iii) rural electric cooperatives; and (iv) a large number of informal
microenterprises providing electricity to rural customers not served by PLN. The provisions of
the Electricity Act are amplified in GO Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN and No. 10/1990 for
others. PLN was established as a public corporation with responsibility for the generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity, and the planning, construction and operation of electric
supply facilities. PLN is managed by a Board of Directors headed by a President Director, who
is appointed by the President and is accountable to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Operational
responsibility devolves upon 17 regions, and the responsibility for major construction upon 13
project managers. PLN has already appointed a project manager for the proposed Besai
hydroelectric power plant.
3.          Since 1969, the Bank group has provided about $4. 1 billion for the power subsector
in Indonesia, through 3 IDA credits, 18 loans, and one supplemental loan. Project Performance
Audit Reports and Project Completion Reports on fourteen projects have been issued. The reports
have concluded that the objectives set out for these projects at appraisal have been achieved.
Project Description
4.          The Besai hydroelectric power plant is proposed to be a run-of-river type
development, with a daily regulating storage capacity, to be built in the upper reaches of the Besai
river in the Lampung province of Sumatera. The Engineering Services Center of PLN, in
association with their Consulting Engineers, have conducted an environmental assessment (EA) of
the proposed hydroelectric plant based on the feasibility study and the preliminary design reports.
The plant will have the following components:



- 85 -                           ANNEX 5.3
- Intake dam
- Power house, about 6 km downstream
- Tunnel and penstock connecting the intake dam and power house
- Access roads to the project site
- Quarrying for stone and gravel to be used for construction
- Construction camp
- Permanent housing colony and offices
- Transmission lines
5.           The dam commands a catchment area of 415 sq.km. Locat- in a steep gorge, the
height of the dam will be 9 meters only; however, because of the slope, the net available head at
the power house 6 km downstream will be about 240 m. Two turbine-generators will be installed
initially in the power house to generate 45 MW each. The headrace tunnel from the dain will run
underground for a length of approximately 5 km, aad connect through a surge tank, with the
underground penstock for a further distance of about 0.6 km leading into the power house. There
will be two access roads; one about 2.5 km from the village of Sukapura to the dam site; the other,
about 2 km long, in the village of Dwikora. A double-circuit, 16 km long, 150 kV transmission
line will connect the power house with the nearest PLN transmission grid to evacuate power
generated at the Besai plant.
6.           There are possibilities of soil erosion because of land clearing operations. There
may also be some minor air and water pollution issues because of construction activities. These
adverse effects will be mitigated by appropriate measures as described below in this summary
report.
Baseline Data
7.           Geophysical - Climate, Physiology and Hydrology. It is a high rainfall area (rains
for 11 months) with a fairly strong wind (39.31 lkn/day) blowing from the north most of the time.
There are no months of water deficit and the air quality in terms of dust content, gases and noise
is considered to be pure. The catchment area is mostly mountainous even though there are some
undulating plains in patches. The country rock is basically volcanic deposit. The drainage pattern
is characterized by many trenches which finally appear as tributaries of the main river. A
catchment area, such as this, has the advantage of having a very small flood discharge. The
groundwater level is quite shallow, about 3-12 m from the land surface. The quality of water has
been analyzed and found to be clean.
8.           Soil. The soil has been analyzed based on the factors of chemical and physical
properties and the factor of climate. The larger parts of the soil comprises of Inceptisol and is
sensitive to erosion. Land is used mostly for Sawah (wet rice cultivation) and also dry cultivation.
Local farmers do not take recourse to conservational measures resulting in very high rate of
erosion. Much of the forest area has disappeared; it has turned into farmland and underbrush.
Future farming operations must include better land management practices.
9.           Flora. There are wet-cultivated areas in the farmlands, garden and forest lands.
Mainly, there are six types of vegetation consisting of stable crops, like rice and maize, root
vegetables like potatoes, and other vegetables like tomatoes, chilies etc. Fruits such as durian,
mahogany wood trees, flowers and bamboos also abound. Many popular varieties of wood are
found in the forest.



- 86-                            ANNEX 5.3
10.         Fauna. The study has recorded 20 species of mammals, 9 reptiles and 10 birds.
There are domestic aiimals like cows, buffakw-'% chicken and sheep. Most of the well-known fish
varieties are found in the rivers.
11.         Socio-econonic Study. A study of the population of the area has been conducted.
The main occupation is farming (more than 80 percent). Farming is not practiced seriously; most
of the people go for traditional rice cultivation and unattended coffee plantation. Over the years
most of the people tend to migrate towards the Trans-Sumatera Highway in search of employment
in small business. People are generally healthy even though malaria and influenza have been
reported. In the survey most of the people tended to support the project.
Inpacts
12.         The environmental impacts of the proposed project can be subdivided into 3
categories: (a) preconstruction, (b) construction and (c) post construction.
(a)   Preconstruction:
Preconstruction impacts include investigation and surveys, and land acquisition.
(b)   Construction:
Land clearing and preparation, movement and operation of heavy construction
equipment and materials, and the concentration of a fairly large construction labor
force, many of whom may come from outside the local region, are the main impacts
of the construction stage.
(c)   Post Construction:
The environmental impacts of the dam and the hydroelectric power plant will be
insignificant, except for liquid effluent and solid wastes from the housing colony
and office facilities.
13.         The project will have both physical and social impacts on the environment and
habitat of the area. However, the social impacts are -not severe as there are no relocation issues.
Most of the affected land for construction activities, comprising the two villages Sukapura and
Dwikora, belongs to the Forestry Departnent of GOI; however, several people cultivate the land
and grow coffee crops on it. The area to be inundated covers private land, where the major crop
is paddy. The village, Waypetai, is close to this area. No residential homes are affected by the
constuction; only a few huts used for keeping crops will need to be relocated. The physical
impacts can be listed as follows:
(a)   Soil Erosion.
(b)   Air and water pollution from construction and waste disposal.
(c)    Social impact of construction.
(d)   Quarrying.
(e)    Water quality.

(f)    Sedimentation o1 the reservoir.
(g)   Scouring of river bed below dam.
(h)   Earthquakes and floods.
(i)    Loss of forest lands and wildlife.
Oj)   Increase of water related diseases due to impounding.
(k)   Impact on drinking water.
Analysis of Alternatives
14.         The run-of-river type development planned for Besai is to provide peaking power
to the PLN system in South Sumatera. One of the main objectives of GOI for the electricity
subsector is to meet the country's energy requirements in a least-ost way, and conserve exportable
petroleum reserves, principally by encouraging the domestic market to substitute oil consumption
by alternative, more economical fuels, such as natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal.
Indonesia's hydroelectric resources are enormous; estimated at about 32,000 MW (out of a
theoretical potential of about 75,000 MW), but their development todate has been limited by their
geographic distribution relative to the load centers where there is demand for electricity. The Besai
site is ideally suited for hydropower development; a dam about 9 meters high constructed at the
narrowest portion of a deep gorge, helping to provide a net head of 240 m just 6 km downstream
from the dam. No natural gas or geothermal energy is available in the vicinity; also a coal-fired
power plant for peaking purposes is not economical. Other forms of energy for the proposed 90
MW power plant are determined to be not feasible.
MNtigation Plans
15.         The mitigation plans for the environmental impacts of the Besai hydroelectric power
plant can be listed as follows:
(a)   Soil erosion - The river subcatchment area of the Besai may be categorized into
two groups; the volcanic group and the hilly group. More than 85 percent of the
area is of the volcanic group. The volcanic material is tuff, covered with andesite
and basalt. Soil erosion will be caused by the construction of access roads and
temporary works, land clearing and cut and fill operations, disposal of tunnel
excavation muck and other spoils. Soil erosion will be minimized by land
reclamation, terracing, and replanting.
(1)   Air and water pollution - Dust suppression and noise abatement measures,
management of waste disposal (domestic and construction) in accordance with
acceptable standards will help mitigate these impacts.
(c)   Social impacts - The construction site will be designed such that workers have a
healthy work environment, adequate recreational facilities outside working hours
and living conditions with acceptable health and sanitary facilities. Potable water



- 88 -                           ANNEX 5.3
supply, waste disposal, health and amenities in contractors' temporary camps and
facilities will be ensured.
(d)   Quarrying - This environmental impact will be minimized by selecting several
suitable sites, far apart from each other. Three possible sites for stone and gravel
have been identified. Quarry I is 4.5 km and Quarry II is 14 km from the intake
dam, while Quarry ImI is located near the proposed power house site. Sand will be
obtained from the surrounding areas of two villages; one about 6 kin, and the other
about 16 km from the intake dam.
(e)   Water quality - Vegetation in the reservoir area will be cleared before inundation
to avoid deterioration of the water quality. Because of the daily pondage that will
expose parts of the submerged land everyday, the vegetation clearing operation will
be undertaken on a regular basis.
(f)    Sedimentation - Scouring gates are provided to rid the reservoir of accumulated
sediments by flushing on a regular basis. Regree-ing of the bare land areas are
expected to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation.
(g)   Scouring of river below dam - The flow rate in the river throughout the year varies
between 11.04 and 32.01 el/s. Even though the steep slope of the river acts as a
disincentive for habitation, and there is no irrigation downstream of the dam, PLN
has decided that, in accordance with Japanese regulatory practices, the plant will
maintain a minimum release of at least I m31s of water from the dam so the river
bed between the dam and the power station never goes dry and that any aquatic life
in the area is sustained. No wild animals or migratory fish, however, are known
to have been found in the arca covered by this section of the river. The discharge
of water from the power plant would amount to about 45.6 M?/s, for A hours a day,
when running at full capacity.
(h)   Earthquake and floods - The project has been designed to accommodate the seismic
acceleration of the volcanic region. The weir, as stated at the outset, is only 9 m
high, and the surface of the reservoir, only 140 ha. The holding capacity of this
rn-of-the-river type development will be small due to its limited volume.
Therefore, the induced seismic effect of the dam is insignificant. A horizontal
stilling basin is designed to dissipate the energy of design flood equivalent to 100
years probable peak discharge.
(i)    Loss of forest lands and wild life - Most of the forest in the project area has
already been converted into coffee plantation. The area to be inundated represens
mostly, wild rice cultivation. However, since the area of inundation is small, the
loss of land is manageable. Some farmers will lose part of their farmland and will
be compensated for the loss in accordance with Bank guidelines for involuntary
resettlement and the Presidential Decree, KEPRES 55/1993. This issue is discussed
in detail under the Resettlement Plan for Besai. There is presence of wildlife in the
vicinity of the project; the main habitat of the animal species is found to be in the
adjacent forest area, very litde of which is affected by the proposed project.



-89-                            ANNEX D.3
(i)    Water related diseases due to impounding - The reservoir is planned to be of a
daily pondage for power generation, which is the inherent nature of a run-of-river
type developmernt. The current in the river is expected to be too strong to supp.ort
mosquito brceding. Additionally, mosquito-larvae eating fish to be stocked in the
reservoir would mitigate this negative impact.
(k)   Drinking water - The reservoir is relatively far from the dwelling areas. People
get their drinking water from the springs or existing wells located near their houses
which are not iikely to be affected by the impounding of water by the dam.
Resettlement Plan
16.         The Resettlement Plan of the-Besai- plant has the following objectives which are in
keeping with dte Bank's operational directives.
development of a timebound resettlement plan,based on replacement valuation and
compensation principles of land and other assets affected by the project
- establishment of a budget and an implementation plan
identification of organizational responsibilities for implementation.
17.         The plan has been prepared after consulting the affected people and NGOs who are
active in the area. The project affects lands (160 ha) in three villages primarily because of
immdation, acquisition for construction of the dam and the power house and for laying roads for
the project. The project affected people (PAP) comprise 129 families both in the inundated area
as also the construction area. In a social survey which was specially carried out in the area, almost
the entire community including the affected families supported the project. The PAPs felt that the
project will bring with it improvements in the infrustructure of the area which in turn wil help in
the growth of both industrial and agricultural activities. PLN is committed to providing them with
roads, drinking water supply, sanitation facilities, etc. Most of the PAPs also expressed a desire
to get jobs in the project. In the public consultation before the preparation of the resettlement plan,
which was held on 14 September 1993, some PAPs raised the question of "Replacement" principle
in the matter of compensation and it was explained to then that the GOI would provide for full
compensation at replacement value and also othbcr opportuni. es to the PAPs so that their quality
of life would positively improve after the project. A fiuther taund of consultation was held with
the local NGOs on 22 December 1993 in which the NGOs seemed satisfied with the solutions
offered by PLN to their concerns regarding the resettlement aspects.
18.         Thirty-five percent of the PAPs expressed interest in land-for-land compensation.
PLN is committed to providing such PAPs with alternate land, after due consultation with them on
their choice. PLN will procure the land and hand over to the PAPs who might choose this option.
The compensation for land acquisition will be determined by a oommittee appointed by the GOI
as per the relevant Presidential Decree. PLN will encourage the PAPs to take up other activWies
like small business, trading and will also help them in developing other skills. PLN will make
counselling and credit faciities available for such people, if desired. Education and training -rill
be provided by PLN in vocational schools to those who may opt for this option. A budget
provision of Rp 660,000,000 (US$330,000) has been made for the implemenion of the plan.



go0* -   -                     ANNEXS3
The resettlement is scheduled to be completed in accordance with the project implementation
schedule, based on which sections of land will be affected earlier due to construction activities or
later, due to inundation. 'rhe resettlement implementation schedule provides for monitoring by a
committee over the next five years.
Monitering and Evaluation
119.        The most important area of action is the strengthening of the internal structure of
PLN so that they may be in a position to monitor the implementation aspects, Vas well as the final
results of the resettlement plan. Pendi'g this, it has been agreed that an independent organization,
suck as the local university and -some- government agencies, would be engaged to monitor the- -
implementation of the resettlement plan, evaluate results, and report on the progress on a periodic
basis. The university will be requested to include a local NGO in their monitoring team.
Institutional Needs
20.         Provision for Technical Assistance has been made under the proposed project to
assist PLN to establish an environmental organization to develop PLN's capability to formulate
corporate environmental policies, evaluate environmental assessmens of its development projects
and monitor environmental impacts and compliance with GOI guidelines for existing projects.
Public Participation
21.         Public consultations have been held by PLN at the project site, with local NGO
participation. During the public conmltations, while 99 percent of those attending supported the
construction of the project, a large majority of the Project Affected Persons (PAP) expressed a
strong preference for cask compensation, and an opportunity to work in the construction of the
project. While the amount of cash compensation will be determined by the Land Acquisition
Committee in accordance with Kepres 55 guidelines, which allows for compensation at the current
valuation of the land, the project proponents (PLN) have agreed to provide work to qualified PAPs
in the construction of the project.

INDONESIA
SUMATERA AND KALIMANTAN POWER PROJECT
ENvRoNMENTAL AssEssMEw  SUMMARY
Banjarmasin Thermal Power Plant
Introduction
1.          Pursuant to the objectives of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to improve the
welfare of the popul.tion and to support the growth of economic activity by meeting the electricity
requirements in an efficient and reliable manner, the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) has
proposed to construct a coal-fired thermal power plant at Banjarmasin, in the Jorong Subdistrict
of South Kalimantan, under the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project. The proposed loan will
be made to the GOI. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to PLN, which is responsible for
the implementation of the project. The project financing includes the procurement under suitable
export-credit/supplier's credit, of the boiler package, inclusive of coal and ash handling plants,
and possible cofinancing by the OECF, Japan, and Australia. GOItPLN will meet the financing
gap from their owti internal resources.
2.          The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for the
electricity subsector of Indonesia. The subsector comprises: (i) PLN, the State Electricity
Corporation; (ii) captive plants; (iii) rural electric cooperatives; and (iv) a large number of informal
microenterprises providing electricity to rural customers not served by PLN. The provisions of
the Electricity Act are amplified in GOI Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN and No. 10/1990 for
others. PLN was established as a public corporation with responsibility for the generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity, and the planning, construction and operation of electric
supply facilities. PLN is managed by a Board of Directors headed by a President Director, who
is appointed by the President and is accountable to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Operational
responsibility devolves upon 17 regions, and the responsibility for major construction upon 13
project managers. PLN has already appointed a project manager foi the proposed Banjarmasin
thermal power plant.
3.          Since 1969, the Bank group has provided about $4.1 billion for the power subsector
in Indonesia, through 3 IDA credits, 18 loans, and one supplemental loan. Project Performance
Audit Reports and Project Completion Reports on fourteen projects have been issued. The reports
have concluded that the objectives set out for these projects at appraisal hav"e been achieved.
Project Description
4.          A sizable deposit of lignite (165 MT proven, plus another 60 ),'vT indicated) has
prompted PLN to build a mine-mouth thermal power plant at Asam Asam, initially with two
generating units of 65 MW each by the year 1998/99 and an ultimate capacity of 660 MW by



- 96 -                          ANNEX 5.6
2014, to cater to the continuing demand growth. The Engineering Services Center of PLN, in
association with their Consulting Engineers, have conducted an enviromnental assessment (EA) of
the proposed thermal power plant based on the feasibility study and the preliminary design reports.
The environmental impacts and their mitigation and monitoring measures, including a resettlement
plan for the Project Affected Persons (PAP), that are planned to be undertaken to ensure that the
impacts are contained within the regulatory limits set by the Government of Indonesia and the
World Bank, are summarized in this report.
5.           The proposed project, 130 km south of Banjarmasin, will be located about 12 km
inland from the coastal area of South Kalimantan, in the village of Asam Asam. The project covers
an area of about 110 ha. The project site is bounded to the west by the Asam Asam river, to the
north by the Baru river, a tributary of Asam Asam, to the east by a secondary forest (mostly tall
grass field), and to the south by another tributary of Asam Asam. The site will support an ultimate
capacity of 660 MW, with 4 x 65 MW and 4 x 100 MW generating units, including the coal
storage and ash disposal areas, staff housing colony, electrical substation and administrative office
buildings, as well as the construction camp. A saw mill is located next to the project site.
6.          Fuel. The fael for the mine-mouth power plant is lignite. The concession for the
coal mines is held by a private operator, PT Arutmin. PLN has already signed a Memorandum
of Understanding with PT Arutmin for the supply of coal to the power plant at a cost of about
US$0.90/MI. The lignite is typically characterized by a heat value of about 4,000 kcallkg, an ash
content of 3.0 percent, sulfur 0.23 percent, and total moisture 35 percent.
7.          Boiler and Turbine. The natural circulation boiler will be pulverized coal fired.
4 coal pulverizers will be installed per boiler. Steam at 87 bar and 5100 C will be generated in the
boiler and piped to the inlet of the steam turbine. Steam flow through the turbine will correspond
to about 270 t/h at full load of 65 MWI. The steam will be condensed in a condenser and pumped
back into the boiler through a series of feed water heaters.
8.          Cooling Water. The power plant will have a closed circuit cooling water system,
with cooling towers, for the condensers. The make up water required for operation will be drawn
from ground aquifers, and treated chemically before use. However, part of the makeup water
could also be derived from the waste water treatment plant, provided the effluent from the plant
is of acceptable quality.
Baseine Data
9.          Geophysical - Climate, Physiology, Hydrology. The project site is located in a
wet, tropical climate area. The local air is very clean, as determined by actual measurements, and
the content of particles and gases is way below the threshold of the Standard Ambient air quality.
The area surrounding the project site is a lowland plain, with almost flat topography, with an
elevation of 0-10 m. The project site was once a rainforest, but this has been cut down many years
ago. It now mostly occupies swampy land owned by the government; only a small part to the west
occupies abandoned rice fields and upland areas. The Asam Asam river, flowing north to south,
empties into the Java sea. The river water is used by the local population living on the river bank
for drinking, bathing and washing purposes. It also serves as a transportation infastructure for
the locality.



-97 -                            ANNEX 5.6
10.         Soil. Soil analysis of the area indicates that it is mostly alluvial. Some latosol, a
red tropical soil developed from the weathering of bedrock with intensive leaching of its nutrient
elements, and some lateritic red yellow podzolic soil, are also present. The lowland alluvial soil
is not much different from the upland soil types cxcept for its low pH value, which is detrimental
to vegetation. It is particularly unfriendly to paldy cultivation, which has been tried in the past
with unsatisfactory results.
11.         Flora. Most of the project area is covered by tall grass (alang alang), interspersed
with uplands, orchards, and bushes. The remaining primary forest in the northern part of this area
is characterized by creeping vegetation and several species of trees that are continuously being
reduced by the logging operations. The secondary forest consists of shrubs and bushes which
undergo a succession of changes due to logging, cultivation, and wood gatherings.  The
predominantly swampy area is always inundated. Mangrove forests occupy the littoral areas, their
density increasing towards the coast.
12.         Fauna. Mammas found in the area are mostly wild pigs, some monkeys, wfld cats,
etc. There are many varieties of birds in the area, including falcons, hawks, parrots, and singing
birds. Lizards and water snakes, as well as some crocodiles, are also found in the riverine areas.
Aquatic biota include varieties of fish.
13.         Socio-economic Study. In all 36 families, comprising 144 people, will be affected
by the proposed project. 26 families reside on the actual project area, while 10 families, belonging
to the same community, reside on the other side of the river. Most of the families in this
community are transmigrants, who once had jobs in the saw mill, but gave up for various reasons.
Preseny, they ear their livelihood by making thatch roofs from nipah palm leaves, by collecting
scrap wood from the saw mill and selling them in the local market and by fishing.
Impacts
14.         The environmental Impacts of the proposed project can be subdivided intu 3
categories: (a) preconstuction, (b) construction and (c) post consuction.
(a)   Preconstruction:
Preconsteuction impacts include investigation and surveys, and land acquisition and
resettlement.
(b)   Construction:
Land clearng and preparation, movement and operation of heavy construction
equipment and materials, and the concentration of a fairly large construction labor
force, many of whom may come from outside the local region, are the main impacts
of the construction stage.
(c)   Post Construction:
The environmental impacts of the power plant will be caused by: gaseous emissions
from the chimney, liquid effluent and solid wastes from the power plant, housing
colony and office facilities.



-98 -                           ANNEX 5.6
Analysis of Alternatives
15.         In the electidty sector, GOl's policy of substituting the use of oil by bydro,
geothermal, gas, and coal-based energy is resulting in a mix with a higher percentageof generation
by these means. One of the major objectives of GO} is to maximize the country's foreign exchange
earnings and budgetary revenues from the sector, mainly through the export of tradeable energy
resources, including oil, gas and coal. Lignite, the chosen fuel for the proposed plant, is not a
tradeable commodity. Additiona1ly, it is cheap; the price of lignite being much lower than that of
bituminous or sub-bituminous coals. The proposed mine-mouth location of the power plant makes
it the least-cost alternative.
Mitigation Plans
16.         Gaseous Emissions. The products of combustion are SO., NOQ, and CO2.
Sulfurous oxides are produced during combustion by the sulfur present in coal, nitrous oxides are
pmduced by the inherent nitrogen in the fuel, as well as nitrogen in the air used for combustion,
while carbon dioxide is the natural product of any combustion when carbon in the fuel unites with
oxygen in the air.
17.         Based on a 100-meter high chimney, a dispersion modeling has been conducted
using the USEPA's SCREEN Model. The predicted emissions at 660 MW generation level
(ultimate plant capacity), and using the design coal, are as follows:
Constituent         Max.Concentration      GOI Standard        WB Standard
SW                      136.8               260                   500
NO1                      88.2                92.5                 100
Dust                      3.0               260                   500
18.         Based on the above results, it is concluded that flue gas dwulfuriz-tion will not be
required; however, coal quality must be closely monitored to ensure that there is no significant
increase of sulfur in raw coal. Ihe regulatory limit with respect to S% emission will be reached
if the sulfur in coal should exceed 0.5 percent.
19.         Although NO2 emission is also indicated to be wihin the regulatory limits, low-NO.
burners will be installed in the boilers to reduce the nitrous oxide emissions. Excess air will be
kept at the minimum required to help complete combustion in the boilers.
20.         Electrosttic Precipitators (ESP) will be instaled in the boilers, specified to have
a dust collection efficiency of 99.7 percent. Particulates discharged from the chimney in any 24-
hour period, with the power plant runnig at full load, will approximate 0.05 tons only for a total
quantity of 640 tons of coal fired in the boilers.



- 99 -                           ANNEX 5.6
21.          Uquid EMueitt. The liquid waste streams are: (a) water treatmemt plant drqins;
(b) demineralizer plant wastes; (c) boiler blowdowr.; (d) cooling tower blowdown; (e) power plant
miscellaneous drains; (f) run off and leachate from the coal and ash yards; and (f) sanitary wastes.
22.          Some of the liquid effluent will be neutralized in a neutralizing basin, while other
streams in a waste water treatment plant, treated for the removal of oily wastes and heavy metals.
The quality of the waste water treatment plan t will comply with regulatory requirements. Tbis
water will then be used as makeup for ihe cooling towers. It can also be used for spraying over
the coal and ash pilcs to prevent dust nuisance, gardening and such other purposes. In the event
ash is disposed 4f in the form of a slurry, the treated waste water from the waste water treatment
plant is a convenient source for that purpose. The sanitary wastes wi1l be treated in a sewage
treatment plant.
23.          Solid Was"s:
(a)   The solid wastes are fly ash and bottom ash from the boilers and fugitive dust in
the coal and ash handling facilities, and the water trea4ment plants. The coal supply
contract will provide for the ash to be taken back to the coal mines by the same
coal haulage trucks, for land reclamation purposes. When this is not possible, ash
will be disposed of in an ash disposal area, sized to accept ash for the next 30
years, assuming there will be no commercial use of ash. However, because of its
pozzolanic properties, fly ash could find use as an admixture to cement to the extent
of 25-30 percent. The market for fly ash utilization is yet to develop in Indonesia.
(b)   Water will be sprayed over the coal pile, as well as the asn disposal area, to
miugate fugitive dust muisance. The coal and ash handling faciities, as well as the
water treatment plants, will be designed to include dust mitigation measures.
Othe Impacts:
(a)    Noise - All power plant equipment will be designed for a maximum allowable
noise level of 85 dBA at 1 meter from the equipment In addition, PLN guideline
of maximum 60 dBA at the fence will apply.
(b)   Safety - OSHA regulations are enforced for the safety of workers and strictly
monitored. The plant design will include provisions for handling emergency
situations that might be caused by cheiaical spills, fires, etc.
(c)   Socioeconomic and Public Health - Even though a mnmber of workers, especially
of the skilled categories, will come from outside the localitv, which could be cause
for initial resenment, the local people will be enriched by the interaction of culture
with the outsiders, as well as transfer of sldlls. Many of the local people will find
work in the construction of the power plant; their income level will rise as result
of the project.
(d)   Flora and Fauna - 110 ha of land clearing will have insignificant negative impact
on the flora species. The land is basically parched during the dry season, covered
at other times mostly in grass and scrubby bush, and some occasional strands of



-100 -                           ANNEX 5.6
taller trees.  The area involved is relatively small. The fauna will migrate and
relocate in other areas.
25.         Transmission Unes. Double-circuit 150 kV transmission lines will be constructed
between dte power plant and Cempaka substation, about 75 kin away, between Cempaka and
Trisakti substations, about 43 km apart, and between Cempaka and Barikin, about 110 km away.
The spread of the impact is along the right-of-way (ROW), 50 m or either side of the transmission
lines. A separate EA has been performed for the proposed high voltage transmission lines. There
is no significant impacts indicated, based on the proposed ROW.
26.         Coal Mine Development. An EA report has been prepared by PT Arutmin fot the
coal mines. Its impacts mainly relate to quality of liquid effluent, noise and dust pollution.
Effective mitigation measures and managing plans have been devised by the developers. The coal
mine development has no resettlement component.
Resettlement Plan
27.         The PAPs (36 families on the power plant site) will be resettled in a manner such
as to receive positive benefits from the project under a plan that has been conceived as a
development program. PLN has prepared a comprehensive resettlement olan in consultation with
the affected people, the host community, NGO and Government of"P&iaiS -Wicating budget
provision, time schedule for implemtntation, and organizational respon..V   ne plan is based
on the Presidentiai decree 55/1993 and the Bank's guidelines. The underiyimg , rin. :le is that mne
compensation and resettlement will be such as to assist the PAPs to improve theb ,ormer living
standards, income earning capacity, and production levels, or at least to restore them. All of the
people in this hamlet have immigrated from other places. As the hamlet has been established on
government land, none of the families have any formal titles to their land. The houses are of basic
construction, rough-sawn timber, with one or two large rooms, and a small veranda facing the main
pathway. Some of the houses have add on kitchens. Many have planted fruit bearing tees in their
back yards, as well as the area in the immediate vicinity of the hamlet. PLN is committed to
building houses for resettlement that will have plot sizes no smaler than the current holdings.
They will also have some open spaces so that those who want to grow fruit trees can do so. The
design of the houses will be such that it is acceptable to the PAPs and uses as much local material
as possible. PLN has also made provision for education and training for those PAPs who may
wish to acquire new skills. These may include apprenticeship or training in vocational schools.
For those of the PAPs engaged in the business with nipa palm leaves, PLN wi1l offer credit
facilities and help set up a cooperative society to better organize the trade. The compensation
amounts and resetflement terms will be finalized by a "Local Team", comprising government
department officials, the subdistrict administrator, the village head, and the PAP in accordance with
Kepres 55 and the Bank's guidelines for involuntary resetement. These will also include
compensation  or the fruit bearing trees. A complete resettlement plan, with budget cost, and
implementation plan has been prepared.
28.         The implementation of the resettlement plan will be completed over a period of 18
months and well ahead of the construction of the power plant. The financing of the resettlement
will be the responsibility of PLN. An area north of the project site has been earmarked, in
consultation with the PAPs, for resettlement. The location of the new site is near the nipah leaf



-101-                            ANNEX 5.6
resources and also, near the project road. Arrangement for infrastructure facilities, such as roads,
drinking water supply to the new site, and sanitation will be made by PLN.
Monitoring and Evaluation
29.          Monitoring and evaluation of the rescettlement plan will be done by an independent
body, consisting of local GOI officials, the university, NGO group, PAP representatives, and PLN
management. The independent body will undertake periodic monitoring of the implementation of
the resettlement plan, identify issues affecting program implementation for attention of project
management and formulate further action plans to improve the program.
Public Par,ieipation
30.          Public consultations have been held by PLN at the project site, with NGOs operating
in South Kaiimantan area in attendance, besides officials of the local government, the saw mill, and
PLN. One of the NGO representatives acted as the moderator fo- the meeting on 23 October 1993.
During the consultation process, PLN agreed to provide for every family: (a) a similar-sized plot
of land and a new house, similar to the one or better than that they now owned; and (b) full
compensation for the tree crop they would have to abandon. PLN would also give preference to
the local people during construction based on their skills and experienice. PLN further agreed to
finance the construction of the necessary infrastructure in the new settlement area to assure, inter
alia, the availability of water for household purposes, --ads, paths and electricity.

INDONESIA
SUMATERA AND KALIMANTAN POWER PROJECT
CONSUTANCY SERVICES FOR
STRENGTHENG PLN'S ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CAPABILIES
I. INTRODUCTION
1.          The power sector in Indonesia is undergoing rapid growth. The fast pace of
development requires additional attention to be paid to the environment.
2.          To date, PLN, which is responsible for power development in Indonesia, has no
environmental policy of its own, nor does it have any dedicated environmental unit at the corporate
or regional levels. This reflects directly on PLN's operations due to: (a) lack of management
guidance during planning and implementation stages; (b) inconsistent selection of technologies for
pollution control; (c) lack of corporate policy on atmospheric emissions, especially in relation to
global warming; (d) the unrealistic low cost of natural resources used by the power industry,
mainly water and land, which leads to wvasteful utilization of these resources; (e) lack of long range
planning.
H. CURRENT °ISTITMONAL STRUCTURE
3.          Environmental matters are presently handled Dy a division in the Engineering
Services Center (PPE) of PLN at the planning and assessment stage. When environmental
assessment (EA) reports are finally approved by the Central Commission (AMDAL) of the
Government, EA monitoring for compliance with regulations is done at the plant level only. The
small environmental unit at the plant level, headed by the chief of the chemical testing laboratory,
manages environmental affairs at each power plant. The unit reports to the plant manager who is
directly responsible for plant operation and maintenance. As a result, management decisions
related to environmental matters may sometimes be biased by production-oriented considerations.
4.          A small environmental unit in the corporate engineering office is responsible for
administeing processing of official environmental permits for new projects. EAs are typically
prepared by consultants, with very little guidance from the company.
5.          Routine monitoring is also sometimes performed as an exteral service by
consultants. The monitoring program is incomplete even though it is based on guidelines set in the
monitoring plan of the environmental impact assessment.
m. PROPOSED OBJECTVES OF TIHE CONSULTANCY SERVICES
6.          The objectives of the consultant's team will be to assist PLN in establishing
environmental capabilities at corporate and plant level.

NNESIA
SUMATERA AND KALTMANTAN POWER PROJECT
DEMAN MANAGEMENT
Background
1.          PLN's five year Corporate Plan and Strategy (RENSALITA 92/93-96/97) establishes
a target of 144 GWh of energy savings by 96/97, from implementation of a DSM program
(24 GWh in 93/94, 85 GWh by 94/95, and 136 GWh by 95/96). Plans are underway to undertake
pilot field tests of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), as well as an electronic ballast pilot program.
Other pilot programs are under consideration as well. Negotiations are also underway with the
ADB to obtain financing that will enable expanded implementation of the some of these pilot
programs.
2.          Whereas PLN's efforts are to be applauded and encouraged, what is missing at
present is a carefully developed and rationalized strategy for DSM and the corresponding action
plan based upon data and conditions specific to Indonesia; including the identification and
development of detailed program designs, establishment of realistic quantitative targets of
penetration and savings to be targeted, and determination of the most efficient delivery and
incentive mechanisms for achieving the established goals of the DSM program as well as the
fnancing plan for DSM. In this context, a recently completed study on demand-side management,
funded by USAID, has identified an action plan for DSM in Indonesia. The USAID study provides
a good base of understanding and a starting point for further analysis and program design, strategy
formulation, and refinement of the action plan.
3.          Key institutional issues also have not been addressed in Indonesia with respect to
DSM. Within PLN itself, if it is serious about expanding DSM from pilot programs to full scale
"production grade' programs, will require the establishment and training of a core group of staff
dedicated full time for this purpose. Simply expanding the responsibilities of existing staff members
or assigning them to yet one more (DSM) task force will not enable PLN to capture savings to an
appreciable degree. Although PLN is a natural candidate for designing and implementing DSM
programs, a role also exists for DGEED especially in the areas of policy formulation and national
energy strategy planning. Specifically, Presidential Decree No. 43, issued in 1991, outlining a
broad mandate in energy conservation, has been followed in 1992 by the preparation of a national
energy conservation plan by DGEED. It is reported that the current goal is a 17 percent reduction
in projected national energy demand by the year 2000. However, specific programs and targets by
sector remain to be identified, including supply and demand-side targets for the power sector
consistent with this ambitious goal. Among some of the other government agencies that have a
bearing on DSM is the Department of Public Works (DPW), that has released guidelines for energy
efficient building design and construction and needs assistance to develop a mandatory building
energy code; including gaining the acceptance of building developers, A&E firms, and equipment
manufacturers.

Proposed TA
4.          The objective of the proposed DSM technical assistance component of the Sumatera
and Kalimantan Project will be to provide funding to facilitate the following types of activities:
e     conduct a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of alternative DSM program
options-technologies, delivery mechanisms, and incentive and promotional
framework-in order to develop detailed program designs for the most promising
options for Indonesia. On this basis, rationalize quantitative targets for DSM
savings by consumer sector, program type, and over the short and medium term.
Identify financing strawgies and effective institutional mechanisms for supporting
DSM implementation, taking into consideration the interests and perspectives of the
various stakeholders and the regulatory framework in Indonesia.
°     develop PLN's institutional capability to conduct and/or manage the full range of
activities that are likely to be required if DSM is to be implemented on a wide scale
and is to be truly effective.
o     train PLN and DGEED staff in the areas of program design, monitoring and
evaluation.
*     design and implement an evaluation methodology for PLN's CFL pilot project as
well as develop a DSM program monitoring and evaluation methodology more
broadly.
5.          The proposed TA would provide for long term technical assistance to facilitate the
work elements identified above among others; perhaps over a two year time frame. The expatriate
consultants (up to two individuals) would be based in Jakarta, possibly in PLN Pusat. They would
work closely with a counterpart team of PLN and DGEED staff. For this purpose, PLN would
assign at least two or three staff members on a full time basis to this effort. Other staff could be
involved on a part time basis. In addition to the long term resident staff, foreign consultants with
special areas of expertise would be available for short term assignments/missions on a as needed
basis. The TA would also include finding for study tours and participation in specialized DSM
seminars/training programs overseas for PLN and DGEED staff. Funding could also potentially
be made available for securing training materials and some equipment to support the DSM program
activities.

INDONESIA
SUMATERA AND KALMIANTAN POWER PROJECT
TERS OF REFEUENCE FOR PILOT PROJECTS FOR PLN'S REIONS IV & VI
Background
1.          Indonesia's power sector is growing rapidly. PLN's installed capacity has increased
from 2,288 MW in 1978/79 to about 11,000 MW in 1992/93, and its sales has grown at an annual
average rate of 16 percent during the same period. A primary objective of the Government of
Indonesia is to ensure efficient and reliable supply of electricity at least cost, while closing the gap
between supply and demand, by constructing new generating plants and extending the transmission
and distribution network. The rapid growth has placed heavy demands on PLN to expand its ability
to manage its ever increasing operations.
2.          PLN's operations in the Outer Islands, i.e., outside Java, are organized into 11
geographical regions (Wilayahs). The operational characteristics of the power supply systems in
the Outer Islands are different from those in Java-Bali. Except for a few minor fragmented grid
systems, based on low capacity (150 kV and lower) transmission lines, PLN's operations depend
upon a large number of small, isolated diesel generators, with a low load factor. Most of PLN's
sales within the Outer Islands are concentrated in the urban areas. The share of captive power in
total installed capacity is about 50 percent.
3.          The long run development of the power sector in the Outer Islands requires the
progressive replacement of the large number of isolated diesel generating units by interconnected
grids supplied by central generating plants. Even though the private sector is expected to play an
increasingly important role in the development programs, and there is scope for harnessing captive
power capacity that is not connected to PLN's grids, PLN will continue to play a dominant role
in the supply of electricity. The transformation of the sector therefore will require a number of
changes in PLN's operations.
4.          At present, PLN is constituted as a single entity, which manages its operations in
all parts of the country with centralized control. The Managers of the regions in the Outer Islands
have limited autonomy and responsibility, and little accountability for theirperformance. Recently,
PLN has developed a preliminary reorganization plan for decentralization of authority and
responsibility. The options for restructuring PLN include the vertical disaggregation of generation,
transmission and distribution functions in the Outer Islands.
Objectives
5.          Through appropriate technical assistance, it is proposed to devise specific action plan
to implement efficiency improvements in PLN's operations through decentralization. PLN's
Regions IV in South Sumatera and VI in South Kalimantan are selected as pilot regions for
implementing the proposals on an accelerated basis to serve as models for other regions.



-120 -                          ANNEX 5.11
Scope of Work
6.          The scope of work would include: (a) strengthen the organization; (b) implement
distribution management recommendaions; (c) prepare a 5-10 year investment strategy for
generation, transmission, distribution and telecommunications, etc., with due cognisance of the
large captive capacity and provide scope for private participation; (d) introduce accounting systems
suited for decentralized operations; (e) decentralize authority for Wilayah managers for staffing,
training, consumer administration, billing, accounting, etc., as if they were an autonomous
commercial center; and (t) design a performance contract between PLN Headquarters and the
Wilayah through which the Headquarters will control.
7.          A management consulting firm is already studying how best to improve utilization
of the instaled capacity in the Wilayahs, reduce demand-supply gap, facilitate adequate
management and financial resources for the Wilayahs to accelerate electrification, create an
incentive framework and performance criteria to promote greater innovation and efficiency, and
introduce a system of management control, budgeting, planning, staffing, manpower development,
spare parts inventory, etc.,. to encourage local initiative. The recommendations under the proposed
TA and detailed action plans for the two pilot projects will need to be developed in light of the
agreed strategy adopted by PLN on the basis of the management consultants' recommendations.

PROCu1tEmET EcIENCY
1.          Improvement of the internal procurement procedures of PLN to significantly shorten
the procurement cycle and satisfy the requirements of the project implementation schedules will
entail the following essential steps. Actions in this regard are required to be taken by PLN as well
as by GOI. While GOT procurement regulations (KEPRES 29 and other related regulations) are
of importance, some of these differ from the World Bank's requirements for procurement, and
cause major delays in the implementation of projects. It is to be noted that, in accordance with the
legal opinions expressed by the Bank and the GOI, Bank guidelines for procurement under
international competitive bidding (ICB) for items financed under Bank loans, supersede those of
the GOI. Although newly-issued Bank procurement guidelines will be mandatorily enforced for
fture lending operations, it is strongly recommended that all procurement under ongoing
operations also conform to the current guidelines.
2.          Standardization of Bidding Docuwn ,f  Current World Bank procurement
guidelines mandate that for all future loans, bidding documiients shall be the Bank's Sample Bidding
Documents (SBD) in their organization, format and language, as this reduces the time required by
PLN to prepare them, the Bank to review them and protects the interests of both the Buyer and the
Supplier. The commercial sections comprising the Invitation for Bids, Instructions to Bidders,
General Conditions of Contract, and other commercial conditions, including the Bid Form, Bid
Security Form, Performance Security Form, the Letter of Intent, etc., should be standardized in
accordance with the Bank's SBD for Goods and for Works. A similar SBD for the Electrical and
Mechanical Works is under preparation by the Bank and will be available shortly. Until such time
as this document becomes available, it is recommended that the FIDIC Conditions for the
Procurement of Electrical and Mechanical Works be used for such procurements. These standards
shall be used for all procurements to be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loans.
3.          Contract signing with the lowest evaluated bidder should be expedited.
(a)   Prolonged discussions with the winning bidder on issues extraneous to its bid cause
major delays. All deviations from the specification, both commercial and technical,
should be listed and attached to the Letter of Intent (LOI), which should constitute
the formation of a Contract, with attendant legal connotations. This should permit
the Supplier to start work immediately upon receipt of the LOI, because even if a
Contract is not signed for any reason, the Supplier is assured of compensation for
any authorized work it undertakes before contract signing. Discussion with the
winning bidder should be restricted to the listed items only and resolved as early
as possible to facilitate the signing of a contract.
(b)   No attempt should be made to increase the "local content" or switch subcontractors
in favor of one who may have a higher level of local participation than the other,



-126-                            ANNEX 5.14
as this is likely to introduce economic inefficiencies. It also violates Bank
guidelines for procurement and may actually constitute misprocurement.
4.           The procurenat proces, leading to contract award, should be completed within
the bid validity period, especially in respect of firm price contracts.
(a)    Current Bank guidelines call for automatic adjustment of the bid prices for all firm
price bids, based on the movement of declared indices in the bid document, such
as for labor and material, in the event an extension of the bid validity is required.
(b)   If Suppliers do not have to build into their price the cost of expected delays in
contract signing, and if it is specified that a delay beyond the bid validity period
would carry automatic adjustment of prices, it can be expected that this policy
would result in a lower level of bid prices to the advantage of PLN.
5.           Leter of Credit (LC) should be opened in no more than 30 days following the
signing of the Contract.
(a)   This requires that contract approval by agencies external to PLN, should be
expedited, which includes Form II approval as well.
(b)   It is strongly recommended that for all large projects, a senior level manager be
assigned to coordinate all aspects of the implementation of the project, especially
those relating to procurement. This senior person would interface directly with
PLN Board, as well as with concerned Government agencies, to expedite the entire
bidding process, including approvals and issuance of L/Cs.
6.           Time taken for the evaluation of Consultant proposals and contract award is too long
and should be shortened.
7.          It may be noted that GOI guidelines for expatriate compensation rates are no longer
adequate in many cases. These rates should be revised to reflect current conditions and updated
annually.
8.           Contract finaLization under export-credit financing needs to be completed with
much greater expedition.
9.           It is necessary to finalize export-credit financing to meet the requirements of the
project implementation schedule, set at appraisal. Contract packages financed by export-credit
should not be seen in isolation from the rest of the procurement cycle under the project.

PROJECT SUPERVSON ARRANGEMENS
1.          PLN's Supervision Arrangements. PLN has appointed Project Managers for the
two major physical components of the project; Besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power
plant. The bidding documents will be prepared in accordance with the procurement schedule, by
PLN's Engineering Services Center (PPE), supported by the Engieering Consultant appointed
for each of these project components. Construction supervision and quality assurance are included
in the scope of services of the Engineering Consultants, who will be assisted by local associates.
Tedhnical assistance components, other than that for GOI, will be managed by PPE who will
supervise the work of Consultants.
2.          GOI's Supervision Arrangements. The technical assistance component for the
Bureau of Environment and Technology to improve its environmental capabilities in the mining
sector will be managed by the Directorate General of Mines, Ministry of Mines and Energy, which
will be supervising the work of the Consultants.
3.          Bank Supervision Inputs. During the initial phase of project implementation, Bank
supervision will involve close monitoring of the procurement and technical assistance activities.
The Consultants will be required to submit monthly progress reports. Preconstruction engineering
services for the Besai hydroelectric and Banjarmasin thermal power plants will be monitored to
ensure compliance with best engineering practices and regulatory environmental requirements.
Implementation of the Resettlement Plans for the two power plants will be closely monitored
through RSI to ensure that the agreements reached with the project affected people and the NGOs
are complied with to the Bank's satisfaction. Technical assistce components will be monitored
to ensure adequate counterpart staff participation and effectiveness of the programs.
4.          The Bank staff resources to supervise the project would be about fifteen staff weeks
for the first two years of project implementation, and would require about three supervision
missions each year; thereafter, Bank staff resource reqirements would decline gradually to about
fur staff weeks and two supervision missions each year. Most of the field supervision activities
would be carried out in conjunction with the supervision of other ongoing power projects and the
processing of future lending operations. The Bank supervision schedule and resource requirements
are listed in the attached table.

INDONSA
SUMATERA AND KALIMANTAN POWER PROJECT
NomS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR TEE FINANCIAL FoREcASTS
1.          Inflation has been taken into account as follows:
(a)   for foreign costs (including indirect foreign costs, excluding fuels), 2.1 percent per
annum in 1991, 4.3 percent per annum in 1992, and 2.5 percent per annum in 1993
and each year thereafter; and
(b)   for local costs (excluding indirect foreign costs and fuels) at 9.4 percent per annun
in 1991, 7.5 percent per annum in 1992, and 5.5 percent per annum in 1993 and
each year thereafter.
2.          Separation of accounts of PLN's operations in Java and outside Java is based
on individual accounts maintained by PLN for each of its regional units. These accounts are
separate except for overhead expenses, which, for the purposes of financial projections, have been
allocated proportionately on the basis of unit sales of energy.
3.          Ener  sales are based on the sales forecasts in Annexes 2.4 and 2.5.
4.          Revenues for FY93 are based on the estimated average revenue per unit sold in that
year.
5.          Fuel/purchased power costs for FY93 are based on the estimated outcome for that
year, and for FY94 and beyond are derived from PLN's computer simulation of system operation.
The fuel costs are calculated on the basis of current domestic fuel prices (established in July 1993)
charged to PLN: fiuel oil - Rp 240/1 plus transportation charges of about Rp 24/1 for Java and
Rp 34/1 for Outside Java; diesel - Rp 380/1 plus transportation charges of about Rp 27f1 for Java
and about Rp 32./1 for Outside Java; coal - Rp 70/kg for Java and Rp 59.2/kg for Outside Java;
geoheWmal - Rp 53.76/kWh for plants at Kamojang, Dieng and Outside Java, and US$0.047/kWh
for plants at Salak and Drajat; and natural gas - US$2.53/thousand standard cubic feet (MSCF) for
Java and US$3.00/MSCF for Outside Java. The fuel prices to PLN ara assumed to remain at their
current level throughout 1994; from 1995 onwards they are escalated on the assumption that prices
for fuel oil, diesel and coal will change in line with international prices and the prices for natural
gas and geothermal wiUl remain constant in dollar terms. Purchase of power from private investors
who would construct generating plant in Indonesia on a "Build, Own and Operate" (BOO) basis,
which is projected to commence from 1997, is assumed to be at US$0.082/kWh (m 1993/94
prices).
6.          PLN's diesel and fuel oil consumption in Java-Bali is expeced to decrease from
about 2,080 thousand kIloliters (3d) and about 2,730 thousand kd respectively in 1993 to 490
thousand Id and 880 thousand kI in 1994, due partly to the retiring of all diesel generators (about



- 140 -                          ANNEX 6.2
115 MW), and partly to the conversion of some gas turbine and combined cycle power plants from
oil to natural gas. This decrease is expected to be followed by a sharp increase in diesel use in
1995 to 2,400 thousand kl, due to the commissioning of combined-cycle (1,500 MW) and gas
turbine (60 MW) power plants, which will be temporarily operated on oil.
7.          Operating expense, other than fuel and personnel expenses, have been forecast
taking into account the facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to foreign and local
cost inflation, as appropriate. Personnel expenses are estimated to increase about 19 percent per
annum to provide for inflation, volume growth and staff training. Repair and maintenance
expenses for PLN's Java and outside-Java operations are estimated at about 2.1 percent and about
3.5 percent of their respective gross fixed assets in operation during the preceding fiscal year.
8.          Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates (straight-line
method) to assets revalued annually. For purposes of corporate income tax, the current Indonesian
tax code permits the use of the accelerated method of depreciation of assets in operation instead
of the straight-line method.
9.          Financing. Terms of foreign borrowings are assumed to be 20 years including 5
years' grace, at average interest rates of 13.5 percent per annum. Terms of local borrowings are
assumed to be 12 years including two years' grace, at interest rates of 20 percent per anm; local
bonds are asswned to be issued at similar interest rates with a maturity of five years.
1O.         Capital expenditures are based on PLN's investment program (Annexes 2.7 and
2.8), and exclude capital expenditures for generation projects proposed to be implemented by
private investors, and the costs of geothermal steam field development, which are assumed to be
incurred by other agencies. The 10 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on the foreign contracts is
assumed to be borne by Government, and on the local contracts it is assumed to by borne by PLN.
11.         Government equity contributions are assumed to be equal to about 23 percent of
PLN's capital expenditures in 1994195, and to 15 percent of annual capital expenditures from
1995/96 onwards.
12.         Gross fixed assets, work in progress and consumers' contributions are
revalued annually, up to FY86 according to Govermnent Regulation No. 45/1986, dated October
2, 1986, and from FY87 onwards, according to weighted annual escalation rates (foreign and
local). The rate base is the average of the revalued net fixed assets in operation, less revalued
consumers' contributions. The rate base does not include work in progress.
13.         Customer acoounts receivables are assumed at about 36 days of energy revenues,
which is the current level.
14.         Tranmission and Distribution (T&D) system losses are estimated to be about
12.2 percent for Java in FY93/94, and are assumed to decline to 12.0 percent in 1994/95 and
stabilize thereafter. T&D losses for outside-Java are estimated to be about 15 percent in FY93/94,
and are assumed to decline gradually to about 13 percent in FY98/99.
15.         In accordance with the prevailing Indonesian tax legislation effective since 1984,
PLN is subject to a 10 percent value added tax (VAT) and to corporate income tax. The



-141 -                           ANNEX 6.2
Government currently bears the VAT on the foreign contracts, and PLN bears it on the local
contracts; this policy is assumed to continue throughout the projection period. With respect to
corporate income tax, the current Indonesian tax code permits the use of accelerated depreciation
of assets in operation, instead of the straight-line method used by PLN in its financial accounting.
As a result, PLN does not expect to pay any corporate income tax for its fiscal year 1992, and
during the projection period up to 1997. In calculating the rate of return, however, any income
tax payments will be taken into account.
16.         By the Minister of Finance decree No.1232/KMK.01311989 dated November 11,
1989, PLN is required to contribute to a fund for the Development of Cooperatves and Weak
Economic Businesses (DCWEB) an amount equal to 5.0 percent of its annual net income after
corporate tax. Such contributions for DCWEB commenced from 1991.
17.         In terms of Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990, PLN is required to contribute
to an Overall Development Fund (DPS), 55 percent of its annual net income after contribution for
DCWEB (para. 15) and corporate tax. Contributions to DPS due for 1990 onwards are assumed
to be paid in five equal installments commencing two years after the year for which the payment
to DPS is due.

IE        CALCULATION: BENEms MEHODOLOGY FOR
RESEDENTIAL CONSUMERS
1.          The methodology used to estimate economic benefits for residential consumers can
be explained with the help of Figure 1, which shows a demand function for a household defined
by two points. One end of the function is anchored by the price-quantity pair (Q1P), where Q,
denotes household consumption of electricity at PLN's average price, P,, to this consumer class.
To anchor the 'upper end" of the demand function, which represents consumer willingness to pay
for higher valued uses of electricity, the price-quantity pair (Q0,P0) is estimated assuming that
kerosene would be used for lighting absent availability of electricity. Household survey data on
kerosene consumption and expenditure for lighting and other data were utilized to establish the
monthly kWh consumption (Q0) that would yield an equivalent amount of lighting intensity
(lumens) prior to the availability of electricity; as well as to convert the unit financial price of
kerosene to an equivalent financial cost per kWh of lighting (Pk). Thus, prior to electrification,
Q5, units of kerosene (in kWh equivalence) are consumed at a financial price of Pk. Following
electrification, Q, units of electricity are consumed at a price of P,.
2.          The net economic benefit associated with released resources is estimated as (Pl-
P,C)Qo, where Pi represents the economic price of kerosene per kWh of equivalent lighting, Pi. is
the economic cost of electricity supply, and QD is defined above.
3.          The incremental consumer surplus on the diverted market is represented by the
shaded area in Figure 1. A linear demand function is postulated between the points (Ql, P1) and
(Qo, Pk) for the purpose of estimating the consumer surplus. This specification tends to
underestimate the willingness to pay since it does not account for the additional value of the higher
quality of light obtained from electricity.

INTERNAL ECONOMIC RATE OF R11:
BESAm AND BAmNARMAS  POWER PLANT
Capital Costs
1.          The capital costs of the plant and equipment, excluding taxes and duties, but
including physical contingencies, have been measured in constant 1993 prices, and are based on
the available engineering estimates. These costs are estimated to be US$172 million for the Besai
plant and US$273 million for the Banjarmasin plant. The capital costs of the transmission and
distribution network strengthening and extension are estimated to be US C 2.5/kWh, based on
recent PLN estimates of the Long Run Average Incremental Costs.
Variable Costs
2.          The only variable costs for the Besai plant are the O&M costs, whose annual value
is assumed to be equal to 0.5 percent of the plant's capital costs. For the Banjarmasin plant, the
fuel costs are based on a border price of US$35.00/ton for standard coal (6,000/kcal/kg).
Assuming a transportation cost of US$5.00/ton, the economic cost at the mine mouth is
US$30.00/ton for standard coal. By extrapolation, the economic value of the 4,000 kcal/kg lignite
used in the Banjarmasin power plant is US$20/ton. With the Banjarmasin plant's thermal efficiency
of 36 percent, the economic cost of the fuel is USC 1.2/kWh. The annual value of the
Bajarnuasin O&M costs is taken to be 2.0 percent of the plant's capital costs.
Annual Energy Generation and Losses
3.          The 2 x 45 MW Besai hydro plant is expected to produce primary energy of 136
GWh per year, and secondary energy of 231 GWh per year, for a total energy production of 367
GWh per year. The transmission and distribution losses are assumed to be 12 percent, with an
additional own/station use of 1 percent, for total losses of 13 percent.
4.          The 2 x 65 MW Banjarmasin thermal plant is expected to produce base load
energy, according to the schedule below, which shows the number of hours for which the plant can
be operated at different load levels. For example, in years 1-2, on an annual basis, the plant can
be operated at 100 percent capacity for 4,500 hours, at 75 percent capacity for 730 hours, at 50
percent capacity for 900 hours, and is unavailable for 2,630 hours. The transmission and
distribution losses are assumed to be 12 percent, with an additional own/station use of 5 percent,
for total losses of 17 percent.

Revenues and Consumer Surplus
5.          The average revenue in 1992/93 was Rp 146/kWh (US¢ 7.0/kWh). The consumer
surplus for industrial, commercial and public customers has been estimated to be Rp 93/kWh
(USc 4.42/kWh), and for residential customers to be USc 11,95/Kwh, as explained in Annex 7.3.
The weighted average of the consumer surplus is USc 5.3/kWh, with the weights based on the
shares in projected incremental sales after the commissioning date of the Besai plant. The weighted
average of the consumer surplus is USc 6.5/kWh, with the weights based on the shares in projected
incremental sales after the commissioning date of the Banjlarmasin plant.
Salvage Value
6.          The length of the analysis is taken to be 25 years, while the length of life of the
Besai civil works is estimated to be 50 years. The salvage value of the civil works is based on the
sum of the discounted values of the cash flows in years 26-50 of a 50-year annuity at a real interest
rate of 12 percent.
