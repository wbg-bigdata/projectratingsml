                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective is to contribute to the improvement of the overall quality and performance of teachers through enhancing teachers' knowledge of subject
                         matter and pedagogical skills in the classroom. Improvement of teacher quality and performance is to be measured by: (i) the increased number of teachers meeting
                         academic qualifications mandated by the Teacher Law; (ii) the increased number of primary and junior secondary teachers in BERMUTU Districts using classroom
                         instruction with specific subject and age appropriate pedagogy; and (iii) the reduction in absenteeism of teachers in BERMUTU Districts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) at midterm is solid. All seven key indicators are on track for achieving or exceeding their agreed targets by
                         project close. Some highlights are: (i) The first KPI has been achieved. 1,501,163 teachers have met academic qualifications mandated by the Teacher Law 2005. This exceeded the
                         end target of 1,400,000; (ii) The number of active professional working groups of primary and junior secondary school teachers, principal and supervisors is approaching 6,200, well

                         in excess of the target of 4,500 envisaged by project close. Although still to be validated by a measure of quality performance (through an appraisal of a random sample of the
                         classroom performance of BERMUTU teachers), it is significant that about 214,000 teachers are estimated to be participating in the 6,135 teacher professional working groups
                         (KKGs /MGMPs) and principal and supervisor groups under BERMUTU. These groups receive in-service professional support through a guru pemandu (teacher coordinator) and
                         links with teacher development and quality assurance institutions (P4TKs and LPMPs). This has proved to be the most viable and accessible route for teachers to receive continuous
                         professional development and the Mid-Term Review has observed that teachers are using the working groups to reflect on their teaching, share experiences, try out more effective
                         and interactive methodologies to improve their teaching. There is a distinct attempt to introduce more constructivist, learner –centered activities in the classroom as demonstrated by
                         the increased attempts to use group work and improve teacher questioning strategies to encourage students to “think for themselves?; and (iii) As noted in the previous ISR the
                         strengthening of the depth and breadth of the regulatory framework governing teachers continues to be the strongest indicator of the project's contribution to improving the quality of
                         Indonesia's teaching workforce.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The MONE organization was restructured twice. By end of 2010 the DG QITEP which housed the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and 22 out of the 28 Project Implementing Units
                         (Satkers) has been dissolved and its functions reallocated across four echelon 1 units, i.e., the DG of Basic Education, DG Secondary Education, DG Early Child Education and Non
                         Formal-Informal Education, and a new board the Education Human Resource Development and Quality Assurance Board. By October 2011 a new directorate general, DG for
                         Cultural Affairs, was added into the Ministry’s organization. Accordingly, the name of the Ministry of National Education was changed to be the Ministry of Education and Culture
                         (MOEC). The government has demonstrated its commitment to ensure the continuity of the BERMUTU Project under this new structure by working closely with all units to ensure that
                         appropriate revisions to the respective budget document (DIPA) 2011 was completed timely and to the DIPA 2012 is underway. In the meeting 2nd February 2012, the Steering

                         Committee has advised the MoEC to properly complete the project implementation by December 2013, as per the Financing Agreement. Accordingly, the progress toward achieving
                         the Key and Intermediate Performance Indicator of the Project Development Objectives shall be monitored closely and availability and sufficiency of funds in DIPA 2012 and 2013
                         shall be secured.

                         The Project has been disbursing reasonably well. As per March 5, 2012, about 78% of the total funds have been disbursed, i.e., 3.7% of the Loan, 96% of the Credit and 85% of the
                         Dutch Grant.
