5.     Summary of implementation progress.

       a. Overall progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO)
          continues to be rated as “satisfactory? while overall implementation progress continues
          to be rated as “moderately satisfactory? largely because of delays in the activation of
          the annual budget resulting from Government internal mechanisms and the Ministry of
          Education bureaucratic reform which affected project implementation units. These
          issues are substantially outside the control of the project.

       b. A major project highlight is the success in building a strong regulatory framework for
          teachers, especially under the component Reforming Teacher Accountability and
          Incentive Systems for Performance Appraisal and Career Advancement which is rated
          as “highly satisfactory.? Regulations have now been issued for recognition of prior
          learning, teacher career progression, continuous professional development, and
          induction for beginning teachers.

       c. Further highlights and implementation milestones include: over 1.5 million teachers
          meet academic qualifications mandated by the 2005 Teacher Law, exceeding the end-
          of-project targeted number of 1.4 million. Currently about 210,000 primary and junior
          secondary teachers have been actively participating in the working group program
          designed to improve their pedagogical skills. This exceeds the target agreed in the
          project performance indicators by 13 percent. Over 800,000 teachers have benefited
          from recognition of prior learning, exceeding the end-of-project targeted number,
          700,000. Number of accredited primary school teacher study-programs has
          significantly increased from the baseline zero to 37.

       d. The cumulative disbursement rate of the Loan, Credit and Grant as of August 30, 2012
          is 85.4 percent and it is estimated that it will be about 95 percent by end of December
          2012. The Task Team is optimistic that the project can be closed in a timely fashion
          with a disbursement rate around 100 percent.

6.       Justification for the proposed reallocation. As a follow up to the Mid-Term Review of
the Project, the proceeds of the said Credit, Loan and Grant were reallocated (dated November 23,
2011) to reflect the actual disbursement as of 2010 and revised disbursement plan 2011-2013.
However, the Government of Indonesia changed the official exchange rates used for budgeting
purposes from IDR 9,200 / USD in FY 2011 to IDR 8,800/USD in FY 2012. As a result, the
actual expenditures of each category up to December 2011, and the budget allocation in FY 2012
(both in USD currency) are slightly different from the agreed disbursement plan for 2011-2013
(used as a basis for the amendment of the proceeds in November 23, 2011). This especially
affected the allocation for the working group program (under Category 4) increasing by USD
566,898, or about one percent. This amount is to be covered by using the unallocated (Category 7)
and some efficiencies of Categories 2, 3 and 5. The proposed reallocation of proceeds is to
accommodate such changes in the exchange rates and has been incorporated into the revised
disbursement plan for the remaining two years of the Project Implementation (2012 – 2013). This
reallocation of proceeds is necessary to properly finance the implementation of the project
activities and meet the agreed Project Development Objectives.
