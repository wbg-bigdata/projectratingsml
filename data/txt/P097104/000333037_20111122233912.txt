3. Summary of implementation progress.

    a. Overall progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) continues
       to be rated as “satisfactory? while overall implementation progress continues to be rated
       as “moderately satisfactory? largely because of delays in the activation of the annual
       budget which are due to Government internal mechanisms and the Ministry of Education
       bureaucratic reform which affected project implementation units. These are substantially
       outside the control of the project.

    b. A major project highlight is the success the project continues to have in building a strong
       regulatory framework for teachers, especially under the component Reforming Teacher
       Accountability and Incentive Systems for Performance Appraisal and Career
       Advancement which is rated as “highly satisfactory.? Regulations have now been issued
       for Recognition of Prior Learning, teacher career progression, continuous professional
       development, and induction for beginning teachers.


                                                 4
    c. Further highlights and implementation milestones include: the number of teachers
       meeting academic qualifications mandated by the 2005 Teacher law has reached
       1,250,000 or 70 percent of the end-of-project targeted number, which represent an
       increase of 350,000, or 39 percent from the baseline. Currently about 210,000 primary
       and junior secondary teachers have been actively participating in the working group
       program designed to improve their pedagogical skills. This exceeds the target agreed for
       the project performance indicators by 24,000, or 13 percent. Over 500,000 teachers have
       benefited from recognition of prior learning: this constitutes about 72 percent of the end-
       of-project targeted number. (See Attachment 1 for a complete update of the PDO
       progress.)

    d. As of November 11, 2011, the cumulative disbursement rate of the Loan, Credit and
       Grant is 69.5 percent. The team is optimistic that the project can be closed in a timely
       fashion with a disbursement rate around 100 percent.

4.      Justification for the proposed reallocation. As part of the mid-term review, the
Government and the Bank team have jointly reviewed the actual expenditures of each loan,
credit and grant category during the first half of the project period (2008 – 2010). There are some
shifts from the original cost calculations, primarily that the number of teachers participating in
the working group program (under Category 4) has substantially exceeded project design
estimates.1 This substantial increase has a flow-on effect for the budget required for supporting
activities such as training of trainers and master teachers, workshops and program management
under Category 3. The proposed reallocation of proceeds reflects these changes in the scope of
activities and is detailed in the revised disbursement plan for the remaining three years (2011 –
2013). This is necessary to properly finance project activities and meeting agreed Project
Development Objectives.

 This is because the number of “remote? working groups is less than anticipated and the balance allocation was
used to finance “regular? working groups. Grants for a remote working group are three times larger than regular
ones.
