A. SUMMARY
This paper responds to the request of the Mayoralty of Baghdad (MOB) dated September 7, 2011
and November 15, 2011 to extend the closing date of the above-mentioned project by 18 months
to June 30, 2013, and to reallocate grant proceeds. The extension of the closing date by 18
months will allow for completion of ongoing contracts and for the disbursement of the remaining
available trust fund amount; while the reallocation of funds is needed to reflect the changes made
to the Rehabilitation and Renewal of Sadr City Sewerage Network sub-project.
The PMT performance is satisfactory and MOB’s primary reason to request the above-mentioned
changes is to compensate for the numerous delays that have been direct consequences of the
prevailing difficult implementation environment.
The project was restructured in April 2010 to extend the closing date, cancel one component that
is being implemented by the government using their funds and cancel phase II, III and IV of the
Baghdad Comprehensive City Development components plan due to security and the resulting
inability of the international staff to be fielded to Baghdad to hold serious consultation work and
to carry out field surveys.




B. PROJECT STATUS
The project’s principal objective is to restore water supply and sanitation services for the capital
city of Baghdad through: (a) reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing priority networks and
treatment facilities; and (b) providing capacity building support through training and technical
assistance. Without an extension, the project will not be able to deliver the full results. With an
extension these results can be achieved as the security situation has improved significantly
allowing the contractors to work on the sites. The team is confident that the works will be
completed by June 2013.

Progress on implementation and towards achieving the Project’s Development Objective is
satisfactory, and reflects the findings of the supervision mission carried out in April 2011. Most
of the contracted works are completed and disbursement stands at about US$48.3 million (74%),
there is no suspension of disbursement. About 90% of project funds are committed.

The status of activities financed under the project is:

       (i)     Rehabilitation of Chlorine and Chemical Units at Al-Karkh Water Treatment
               Plant – under implementation;
                                                  1
         (ii)     Rehabilitation of “2B? Pumping Station in Shark Dijla Water Treatment Plant –
                  completed, (motors and valves replaced);
         (iii)    Rehabilitation of Abu-Nuwas Raw Water Pumping Station – completed, (6 pumps
                  replaced);
         (iv)     Rehabilitation and Renewal of Sadr City Sewerage Network - two contracts
                  ongoing and five contracts completed (78.5 km of sewers laid and 7000 new
                  house connections rehabilitated in identified sectors in Sadr City);
         (v)      Rehabilitation and Renewal of Water Network in Za’afarania – completed, 46 km
                  of old water network renewed and expanded;
         (vi)     Technical Assistance and Capacity Building – ongoing (construction supervision
                  contracts, audit services, training etc.);
         (vii)    Development of Comprehensive City Development Plan of Baghdad- Phase I-
                  completed.
b)      There are no outstanding audits under the project, and the previous audit reports have
been found satisfactory to the Bank. The performance of the Project Management Team is
satisfactory and there has been no suspension of disbursements.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES
a)       Project Costs
As most of the Project works and goods contracts are all either completed or under
implementation, the changes shown in table below reflect the actual project components costs
and the estimated cost to complete activities that have not yet been contracted.
                                                                                        Original        Proposed

b)       Reallocation of Grant Proceeds

The nature of one of the activities planned under the “Rehabilitation and Renewal of Sadr City
Sewerage Network? changed from a works to a goods contract. Under this specific activity, the
equipment (vacuum, jetting and CCTV systems) to be purchased is urgently needed to clean the
city’s sewers, which will eliminate the current overflow of wastewater into the streets of Sadr
                                                            2
City; thereby significantly increasing the quality of life and reducing the risks to public health
for more than 80,000 people in Sadr city. In order to reflect this change, Schedule 1, of the Trust
Fund Grant Agreement needs to be revised to reflect the changes per each category as follows:

c)       Closing date
The closing date needs to be extended from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2013. The
project's original closing date of August 31, 2007 has been extended three times to accommodate
the delays caused by the difficult implementation environment as a result of the security situation
which affects the access of contractors and consultants to the work sites. The first extension (23
months to July 31, 2009) was approved in June 29, 2007. The second extension (12 months to
July 31, 2010) was approved in March 3, 2009 and the third extension (18 months to December
31, 2011) with the project restructuring was approved on April 30, 2010. The revised
implementation schedule, reflecting the new closing date prepared by the PMT and satisfactory
to the Bank team, is shown in Annex 2.
