approaches into development planning at the district level. In the aftermath of the Aceh
disaster, and at the request of the Government of Indonesia and the concerned local
governments, the Bank team expedited preparation of a standalone SPADA operation for
the province of Aceh and the island of Nias (in the province of North Sumatra), intending
to complement the CDD approach in the Kecamatan Development Project by linking
community demand with district planning. This expanded the geographic scope for
SPADA implementation within the two disaster-affected areas and was financed by a
range of grants from donors interested in more participatory and socially aware
approaches to reconstruction and recovery.

Background. A particularly striking aspect of Indonesian development is the regional
variation. Rural provinces, such as the eastern islands, Tanah Papua, and parts of Sumatra
show poverty rates exceeding 50% of the rural population, and substantial areas within
the eastern islands still experience poverty and food insecurity. In addition to high
poverty and the difficult geography, problems in the off-Java areas have been
exacerbated by occasional outbursts of violence and civic conflict, particularly after the
fall of the New Order government in 1998. Soon after this political transition, Indonesia
also embarked on an ambitious decentralization program through Laws 22 and 25/1999
that became effective in 2001. This shifted many government functions from the national
level to the country's 430 local governments. District heads, formerly appointed by
Jakarta, were elected through direct elections, local government spending rose
significantly, and development services, such as health and education, were transferred to
the districts.

Due to the heightened needs in disadvantaged, post-conflict and post-disaster areas -
including damaged or destroyed infrastructure, disrupted essential services, large
numbers of internally displaced people, and lack of services for conflict resolution - and
with enduring risks of social disorder, there was a clear need for a framework and an
operation that could address both poverty and governance in the newly decentralizing
environment. The World Bank was already supporting community-level participatory
processes through the series of Kecamatan Development Projects (KDP), a successful
community-driven development (CDD) project which had made significant investments
in community planning and building village assets since 1998. The Bank also recognized
that community-based approaches in disadvantaged and conflict-affected regions had to
be complemented with supporting the new role of district governments in arbitrating and
deploying authority. Therefore, a separate project was prepared that would combine the

                                            1
comparative advantages of a CDD approach – participatory planning and investments in
communities – with support for development planning. A number of projects for local
government strengthening were being developed by the Bank at the time, and there were
requests from the GoI that the CDD approach used by KDP should be applied for better
integration with regular government operations.

This was to be achieved under the nationwide “Support for Poor and Disadvantaged
Areas Project (SPADA)? (see Report No. ICR00002259), approved by the Bank in June
2005, and which started implementation later that year by the Ministry for Disadvantaged
Areas (MinDA). This provided a mechanism through which participatory and conflict-
sensitive planning procedures could be incorporated into government decision-making in
40 disadvantaged districts. This national project included twelve of the poorest districts
of Aceh, selected based on a set of criteria established by MinDA.

The tsunami and earthquake disasters. The earthquakes and tsunamis that struck
Indonesia and several other countries in the Indian Ocean region on December 26, 2004,
resulted in one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human history. Indonesia bore
the brunt of the disaster. In Aceh and North Sumatra, the disaster left more than 230,000
people dead or missing (including 5,000 civil servants), caused an additional 700,000 to
become homeless, washed away hundreds of communities, collapsed many local
governments, and devastated normal social, economic and political life in the affected
areas. At the time of the disaster, there was also an independence movement active in
Aceh that was in serious conflict with the Indonesian government, and also affected the
general population, especially in more remote communities. Following the tsunami and
the destruction in its wake, a peace agreement – the Helsinki Accords – was negotiated
and signed by the GoI and the Free Aceh Movement in August 2005, and the armed
conflict ended, facilitating reconstruction and recovery.

Bank and Government actions. At the time of the tsunami, SPADA was under
preparation and it was intended that Aceh would be covered, in part, under the national
program. However, following the tsunami and the subsequent establishment of the
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency 1 (BRR), the government accelerated launch
preparation for the SPADA project in Aceh, and subsequently proposed that it be
expanded to cover all 17 districts in Aceh, and the 2 districts in the neighboring island of
Nias. The Government also asked that SPADA’s programs for post-conflict reintegration
and development be substantially strengthened for Aceh by including damage and
vulnerability assessments, support for local justice sector reform, and practical training to
help local governments mediate conflict successfully. Rather than incorporate these
additional efforts into what at the time was an un-tested nationwide SPADA project, the
GOI requested the World Bank-managed Multi Donor Trust for Aceh and Nias (MDF) to
provide a grant for a special free-standing SPADA project in Aceh and Nias with the aim
to rebuild public services such as infrastructure, health and education, building trust in
government and consolidating the peace efforts. A 2006 evaluation of SPADA by MDF


1
 BRR was charged with coordinating and implementing rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in the
Province of Aceh and on the island of Nias (in the Province of North Sumatra).

                                                  2
firmly established it as an appropriate and relevant mechanism to meet the post-disaster
challenges in Aceh and Nias. The grant agreement for the standalone operation made
specific reference to the nationwide SPADA project that was financed by a loan and
credit from the Bank.

SPADA’s design fitted well with BRR’s reconstruction strategy, which was tasked to be
the executing agency for the new project and receive the overall budget. The project was
implemented through MinDA; they provided all technical assistance and implementation
support through the project, using the same structure and staffing as for the nationwide
SPADA project. Bappenas was the project management unit (PMU) for both SPADA
projects.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The objectives of the project are to strengthen governance, promote growth and improve
service delivery in participating provinces and participating districts, and support the
recovery of affected areas through: (a) strengthening of local participation in
development planning; (b) promotion of private investment and job creation; and, (c) an
increase in the utilization of effective education, health and dispute resolution services. 2

The key PDO indicators are (i) improved access to cost-effective, quality infrastructure
(EIRR>20%) through participatory planning processes; (ii) a decrease in non-attendance
of primary school by children aged 7 – 12, by more than 5% in Aceh, and more than 11%
in Nias; and (iii) a decrease in non-attendance of junior secondary school by children
aged 13 – 15, by more than 13% in Aceh and by more than 29% in Nias.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDO and key indicators were not revised. However, at the time of project
Negotiations, two PDO indicators from the PAD regarding assisted births and
immunization coverage were dropped, since it was felt that the project alone would not
be responsible for achieving these targets, even as the health component of the project
was retained, but mainly for infrastructure and training. In addition, three intermediary
(minor) indicators in the PAD and GA have not been regularly reported on, although they
are captured in this ICR. One indicator in the PAD and GA (“percentage of M&E and
study findings used in the Project decision-making process?) was mistakenly not included
in the M&E framework and cannot be reliably tracked, and, as this ICR describes, the
project did not deliver comprehensively on its planned M&E studies.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of the project were people living in Aceh and Nias that were
affected by natural disasters (tsunami and earthquakes), conflict, poverty, illiteracy and


2
  Note that in many documents, including ISRs, this is simplified to reference only the first half, dropping
the “through? section. However, the PAD, GA and MTR are consistent in using the longer formulation.
The shorter formulation is identical to that of the nationwide SPADA project with the addition of “support
the recovery of affected areas?.

                                                     3
poor quality education, disease and inadequate medical facilities, ineffective local
planning processes, communal conflicts, and limited, or lack of, access to justice.
Additional beneficiaries were small business people who were supported by the private
sector development (PSD) initiative. Also, local government staff (at the district and sub-
district levels), education and health professionals, and legal staff, benefited from training
and improved working conditions. Additional beneficiaries were internally displaced
persons (IDPs) and ex-combatants.

1.5 Original Components
The project consisted of the four components of the Government Executed grant (TF-
57955), which are described below. Additional investments included the two NGO-
executed trust funds (TF-90807 and TF-93074), funded by MDF and linked to the project.
An additional umbrella trust fund, TF070672, financed by the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID) and administered by the World Bank
supported eight additional recipient managed ‘child’ trust funds 3. All these separate trust
funded activities were carried out and implemented by various national and international
NGOs in support of the main project objective. While not included in the PAD financing
plan for the original project and while each TF had its own grant agreement, these trust
funds are justifiably covered in this ICR and the assessment of the project’s PDO. Fuller
details of their activities and outputs are reported under “Trust fund support? in section
2.2 and in Annex 2a. These trust funds also have GRM/ICM filed that may be further
referenced.

Component A: District Grants (US$ 12.76 million). The purpose of the district block
grants was to support larger-scale technical proposals – emerging from the village and
sub-district planning process – that contributed to reconstruction, cooperation, and
development. For the first two years of the project, the maximum size of each proposal
was US$50,000. The component covered all 17 districts in Aceh (but excluding two
municipalities) and the two districts in Nias (in 2009 split into five). District grant
amounts were set at an aggregate of about US$300,000 (equivalent) in the project’s first
year. This would allow CDD operations to be linked with the newly empowered districts,
especially the planning boards and technical service agencies. The main difference from
the nationwide SPADA was the absence in SPADA Aceh-Nias of sub-district block
grants for tertiary village infrastructure. The reason for this was that KDP/PNPM
operated in all Aceh-Nias sub-districts, providing block grants; outside of Aceh-Nias,
sub-districts were divided between SPADA and KDP.

Component B: Capacity Development/Planning Grants (US$ 9.22 million). 4
Activities financed under this component were a combination of training, practical
exercises, professional technical support, and the development of learning networks. In
addition, funds were provided for operating costs arising under the project on account of

  Its legal name was “Strengthening Post-Conflict Reintegration Aspects of the Support for Poor and
Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) for Aceh?.
4
  This sum is for the main SPADA project trust fund (TF-57955), EGA (TF-90807), LGSP (TF-93074) and
seven DFID trust funds (TF-070672).

                                                4
local contractual support staff salaries other than salaries and benefits of the Recipient’s
full time employees. This was aimed to support the Recipient’s contribution towards the
Project Implementation Unit at MinDA and BRR. In addition, under this component,
SPADA partnered with existing donor programs, such as the United States Agency for
International Development’s (USAID) Local Government Support Project (LGSP),
providing support to district governments and the communities through health and
education diagnostics, support for civil society forums, training of district legislators in
public expenditure analysis and formulation, and improved planning and budgeting. This
component supported the Aceh provincial government, particularly for monitoring
progress of improving local investment climates, funded separately by TF093074,
implemented by The Asia Foundation. This component also included several activities
specifically related to post-conflict reintegration: an alternative dispute resolution
program consisting of a program of facilitated mediation and court referrals for peaceful
resolution of conflicts; and a provincial and district working group that involved
representatives from the police, the Attorney General’s office, the MOHA and legal
NGOs. There were also smaller pilot programs to develop community-based
reconciliation activities, youth employment and other incentives to promote nonviolent
dialogue; pilot work on community-based land mapping for dispute resolution was
launched in the project’s second and third operational year. These activities were funded
under the DFID grant (TF070672).

Component C: Implementation Support (US$ 9.83 million) 5.
Three implementation support packages were included in this component. Firstly,
technical assistance for the three different levels of government as follows: (i) a national
management team, (ii) an oversight and monitoring unit in each province, and (iii) a
multi-sector support team in each participating district. Linked to this management
structure was a specialist procurement consultant to work with the procurement
committee to manage procurement, mainly during the project’s startup period. Secondly,
this component financed specialized consultants to carry out baseline inventories,
investment climate surveys, and needs assessments; these were intended to deliver
educational and health services and to provide training and operational support for an
alternative dispute-resolution program. And lastly, the component included programs for
information dissemination, including radio and public awareness programs to address
issues related to reconciliation, funded through the DFID grant.

Component D: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Studies (US$0.91 million). 6
The core of this component was a package of quantitative and qualitative baseline and
intermediate surveys and case analyses that could track impacts due to project
interventions. US$0.2 million was budgeted for independent audits that would begin in
the project’s second year.

There was no revision of the project components.



1.7 Other significant changes
On January 8, 2009, in anticipation of the end of BRR’s mandate on April 16, 2009 and
with MDF’ agreement, the Bank approved the Ministry of Disadvantaged Areas
(MinDA) as the full executing and implementing agency for this project. MinDA
assumed all commitments and responsibilities of BRR.

On April 8, 2010, with agreement by the MDF, the Bank approved an extension of the
Grant closing date by 18 months to December 31, 2011 to allow completion of sub-
project implementation. This was formalized through an amendment to the Grant
Agreement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project preparation. Preparations for the nationwide SPADA project begun in Aceh in
June 2005 – six months after the tsunami had struck – and included mapping of the socio-
economic conditions, assessment of social tensions, human resources and local
government capacity. At BRR’s request and with MDF funding, the separate SPADA
Aceh-Nias project extended coverage to all seventeen rural districts in Aceh and the two
districts on Nias. With coverage of post-conflict, post-disaster and disadvantaged districts,
this was a project of a different magnitude than the original SPADA and the intervention
generated much interest among development partners to contribute, either through MDF
or separately, to the project.

At the time the project was designed, there was still relatively limited experience in the
Bank of working in post-conflict and politically fragile areas: in fact, the preparation and
implementation of SPADA – and its challenges – contributed to the development of the
operational policy on post-conflict projects. Implementation was thus characterized by
improvisation and “sailing while building the ship?, both by MinDA and the Bank.

Furthermore, there were some naivety in terms of how the project would interact with
local government planning, and a limited understanding of the challenges posed by a
deeply entrenched bureaucracy and rent-seeking political economy. Neither the
implementing agency nor the Bank was able to provide a strong framework for the type
of local government reforms that the project intended to bring about, beyond training and
increased ownership. It was therefore decided that, rather than launching an entirely new
program component for local government capacity strengthening, SPADA Aceh-Nias
would collaborate with the already active and successful Local Governance Support
Program (LGSP) funded by USAID and executed by RTI International. The LGSP was
expanded to ten districts in Aceh, and was funded by an additional US$2.53 million grant
from the MDF. A third separate trust fund – the Economic Governance in Aceh project

                                             6
(EGA) implemented by The Asia Foundation – supported the local business climate by
streamlining local government business regulations and strengthening businesses’
capacity to advocate for reforms.

Project design and the decision to have MinDA as project implementation unit was in line
with the national SPADA project that had been approved a year earlier but was only just
starting operations. Some experiences from the SPADA appraisal and early
implementation was taken into account, but SPADA Aceh-Nias implementation
arrangements had to be adapted, first to the post-disaster and post-conflict situation in
Aceh and Nias, and secondly to the key role the BRR played during the early stages of
reconstruction in Aceh and Nias. Until the expiration of BRR’s mandate, all funds flowed
through BRR and they transferred block grants to local governments and TA funds to
MinDA that built on the nationwide SPADA structure and staffing.

Risk identification and mitigation. Project design and appraisal had identified several
risks as “High? and proposed mitigation strategies and actions as follows:
(i) Institutional weakness was a major risk because MinDA was newly established and
lacked experience. Furthermore, as a state ministry without line agencies, MinDA was
dependent on local government agencies, whose post-disaster capacity was limited.
Moreover, all funds had to be channeled through BRR, and MinDA was responsible for
technical assistance contracts only. GOI agreed that, should implementation performance
be unsatisfactory, the project would be moved to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)
- the implementing agency for the KDP projects.

(ii) In 2006, peace was still fragile in Aceh after 30 years of armed conflict. Expectations
for a ‘peace dividend’ were high, while government’s ability to deliver was low. To
address this risk, DFID was providing SPADA with a parallel grant to specifically
support post-conflict reintegration of ex-combatants in support of the PDO.

(iii) There was a high risk of corruption because of the large number of ex-combatants
and weak local governments who received large reconstruction and development budgets.
The project was provided with extra Bank oversight and supervision from its Aceh office
to ensure full implementation of the anti-corruption action plan (ACAP).

(iv) Financial management was rated as high risk, particularly how grant beneficiaries
would use and account for the funds, and whether the funds were used for the intended
purposes. Based on KDP experience, a comprehensive action plan was drawn up to
mitigate the FM risks; it included special TA to the government’s project management
unit (PMU) and Project Implementing Unit (PIU) and to the local implementation teams,
independent monitoring by NGOs and journalists, internal controls and external audits.

(v) Some district governments in Aceh had been wiped out almost completely and were
not functioning anymore having lost many of their staff, their offices and their records.
They had to be re-built and developed over the medium term which entailed high risks.
The main mitigation action was the support of the LGSP and EGA projects and additional
technical assistance and implementation support for the affected districts.

                                             7
2.2 Implementation
Project launch. The organizational arrangements for implementation consisted of a
coordination committee formed by BRR, a PMU at Bappenas and the project
implementation unit (PIU) in MinDA. At the local levels, district planning committees
and project management units (Satker) were established. After BRR’s mandate expired in
2009, the coordinating role was taken over by the provincial and district coordination
teams hosted at the provincial planning board (Bappeda).

Although most district Project Management Units (Satker), district management and
technical teams had been established by November 2007 (a year after effectiveness),
government processes such as procurement and disbursement were seriously delayed in
the project’s initial years, including the critical appointments of the District Management
Consultants (DMC) and the Provincial Management Consultants (PMC) that were only
awarded in early 2009. However, while waiting for project mobilization, MinDA used
loan funds from the national SPADA project (P078070) to fund project activities in Aceh
and Nias, including the DMC and PMC. To further assist implementation, the technical
assistance by the national SPADA National Management Consultants (NMC) was
amended in 2009 to also cover technical assistance to Aceh Nias. Furthermore, having
identified the pitfalls of delay fairly early on, and in order to mitigate against a vacuum in
technical assistance to project implementation, in 2007, MinDA and the Bank established
joint task teams based in Aceh to assist project implementation, each consisting of three
consultants. The Bank also conducted procurement training for the GoI procurement
committee and MinDA PIU in 2007 and 2008. In an attempt to accelerate the
mobilization of consultants, the Bank also offered assistance with simplifying and
streamlining procurement processes. In 2008, Crown Agents was contracted to provide
procurement and FM training to Aceh district coordination teams.

The initial difficulties and delays were due to a number of reasons: (i) BRR’s work
overload and lack of experience with CDD projects; (ii) national-level problems with
procurement due to inconsistency between World Bank and GoI procurement guidelines,
(iii) late issuance of central government budget that caused poor quality planning; and
(iv) difficulties with attracting qualified consultants willing to work at government-set
salary rates in a setting saturated by international agencies.

Progress of implementation and MTR. As a result of the early challenges described
above, in June 2008 and again, in January 2010, the project’s implementation progress
(IP) was rated as “moderately unsatisfactory?. Specifically, financial management (FM),
project management, procurement, and M&E were rated as “unsatisfactory?. In early
2008, the Bank requested that (i) coordination between project actors be increased; (ii)
the consultants’ poor performance be improved; and (iii) the procurement processes be
accelerated, especially for the NMC, PMC and DMC as well as other technical assistance
such as procurement and financial management, and implementation assistance for
Private Sector Development and for Mediation and Community Legal Empowerment.
During the same period, GOI had already taken some corrective action by holding weekly
coordination meetings between Bappenas, MinDA and BRR. But procurement delays
continued to impede progress throughout 2008, and supervision by consultants was

                                              8
deemed to be ineffective due in part to poor training and insufficient remuneration and
operational costs.

Disbursement was only at 36 percent by 2009, and a mid-term review (MTR) was
conducted in February-March 2009, jointly with the MTR for the nationwide SPADA
project. Some 16 problems and corresponding actions were identified and agreed, mainly
relating to procurement, financial management, and general project monitoring and
management. The Bank also suggested a closing date extension to complete the 2009
sub-projects subject to good implementation progress. During the subsequent review
mission in early 2010, the Bank found that – due to MinDAs’ efforts – 13 of the 15
agreed actions had been taken and project performance had improved, especially the
completion of sub-projects, fiduciary control and dealing with fraud and mismanagement
cases. Due to limited human resources and low capacity, implementation in the remote
island of Nias posed special challenges. In 2007 and 2008, disbursement was at 30% of
the block grants, and in 2009 there were no disbursements at all 7. In 2010 the Bank held
meetings in Medan and Jakarta in an effort to get some sub-projects implemented, but
administrative and political problems persisted.

There was no formal restructuring at the time of the MTR. Instead, a series of actions and
changes were agreed with MinDA, including (i) extending the closing date by 18 months,
(ii) formally changing the implementing agency from BRR to MinDA, and (iii)
enhancing procurement capacity and financial management. There was little disruption to
the project implementation progress as a result of the handover from BRR because
MinDA had already been the de facto implementing agency even when BRR was still
nominally leading project implementation.

Implementation performance. Beginning in 2009, the project started to deliver as
designed. Full block grants were disbursed in 2009, 2010 and 2011 (except in Nias, for
political reasons). The main reason for this turn-around was improved support from the
NMC and PIU, a strengthening of the MinDA management team, and that the capacity
development provided by MinDA and the Bank Task Team to project stakeholders
started to bear fruit. The effectiveness of the program depended on intensive facilitation,
technical assistance and supervision. The SPADA projects had in 2010-11 a team of 20
technical specialists in Jakarta. At the district level in Aceh and Nias, SPADA had 115
professional staff members.

During the second half of 2011, after the completion of sub-projects, much effort went
into project documentation and closing. This included the formal hand-over of SPADA
sub-projects from MinDA to respective local governments, so that O&M funds could be
allocated. Project documentation and inventory were completed by December 2011, and
sub-projects were formally handed over by MinDA to the respective district governments
for all 18 participating districts by December 2011 for formal registration. “SPADA

 The undisbursed portion in 2007 and 2008 was mainly due to the low number of sub-projects that were
implemented in Nias, and in 2009 because of the political tensions after a split of Nias district into four new
districts.

                                                      9
Maintenance Teams? have been established in all districts, and guidelines and training
provided by MinDA. Although outside of the direct control of MinDA, most districts
have committed themselves to provide budgets for operations and maintenance.

Owing to the delays in initial mobilization, however, and despite the improvements post-
MTR and extension of the closing date, USD 4.2 million (approximately 20 percent of
the total grant amount) remained undisbursed and was returned to MDF in 2011 for
reprogramming because: (i) block grants fell almost 20 percent short of the estimates; (ii)
implementation support and technical assistance during 2007-08 was funded by the
nationwide SPADA project; and, (iii) none of the monitoring and evaluation studies were
implemented due to procurement problems.

Trust fund support. As noted, implementation of the core project was enhanced by a
number of Bank-administered TFs, as per the following table:

Implementation and achievement of the PDO was very effectively supported and
complemented by these trust funds (TFs) as follows. More details can be found in Annex
2a.

   1. “Economic Governance in Aceh? (EGA), a separate grant from the MDF (TF-
      093074), was implemented by the Asia Foundation. The objective was to support
      Aceh’s post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction and rehabilitation program by
      improving the local business climate, streamlining business regulations and
      strengthening businesses’ capacity to advocate for change. Overall, the EGA
      program was implemented successfully and achieved its objectives. Through the
      establishment of the “one stop service shop? (OSS) for business licenses, local
      businesses in the five participating districts benefited from better access,
      simplified procedures and requirements, and less time and money spent when
      obtaining business licenses. Most of the OSS are still in operation in 2012.

   2. The nationwide “Local Governance Support Program? (LGSP) was launched by
      USAID in 2005 and implemented by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI). It was
      subsequently supported by a grant from the MDF (TF-090807) with the objective
      of strengthening district capacity and anchoring bottom-up planning in
      government institutions and civil society organizations, with a particular focus on
      the local ability to prepare social and infrastructure projects and deliver quality
      public service development programs. Through the LGSP, capacity was built in
      ten districts to: (i) use participatory planning processes for budgeting development
      activities; (ii) develop a performance-based budget; and, (iii) improve public
      financial management. As a result, policies and regulations for community
      participation in planning, decision-making and oversight were enacted in five
      districts, and hundreds of legislators, LG staff and civil society members were
      trained in various aspects of improving local governance. LGSP was an
      innovative partnership of donors and local partners.

   3. The DFID, through TF070672, provided an US$ 9.89 million grant for parallel
      financing of the project, out of which US$7.16 was Recipient Executed. The
      objectives were: (a) strengthening the capacity-building components of SPADA
      Aceh-Nias to ensure the sustainability and impact of investments; (b) helping to
      ensure that different vulnerable groups were included; (c) addressing specific
      tsunami and conflict recovery needs in the dynamic war-to-peace transition
      context in Aceh; and, (d) providing frequent and intensive project implementation
      support by Bank staff. Overall, implementation of most grant activities,
      particularly those funding the supporting activities (access to justice, PSD
      strengthening, support for vulnerable groups), was satisfactory, and was rated as

                                           11
       such by DFID. Targets were achieved or exceeded, and the project generated ten
       relevant analytical studies and evaluations. The Bank provided adequate and
       timely support to local governments and other implementing partners in the
       conduct of Bank-executed activities, and fulfilled tasks and responsibilities related
       to overall program secretariat, supervision and M&E.

While the range of complementary trust funds had undeniable benefits and positive
impacts, as illustrated above, arguably, owing to the considerable number of trust funds
that supported the PDO and funded extra initiatives, it was difficult to coordinate and
integrate all these activities, especially at the national level. Opportunities were missed to
take full advantage of the various trust funds and achieve greater synergy and benefits by
linking the EGA, LGSP and DFID project closer to the main SPADA project, and more
broadly incorporating the achievements in all districts. For future projects adopting such
a model, the PMU should take on this coordination role.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design. Through the DFID TF, the PMU (Bappenas) was assisted to set up an M&E
Framework and Manual for project implementation. This framework was designed to be
conducted through a series of exercises, including community participatory monitoring,
regular field supervision and monthly progress reporting through MIS, independent
monitoring by civil society groups, qualitative and quantitative household surveys,
technical/sectoral studies (EIRR, facility and user surveys), private sector development
assessment tools, conflict incidence mapping, vulnerable population impact assessments,
training tracer impact assessments, and financial audits.

Implementation. Although the concept for the M&E design in the PAD was ambitiously
comprehensive, it appears that neither GOI agencies nor the Bank paid sufficient
attention to the overall execution of the framework. Most seriously, no base-line study
was commissioned – the rapid roll out of the project in post-disaster Aceh was deemed a
priority. The MIS for the entire SPADA program, including the SPADA Aceh-Nias, had
serious problems, and “availability and accuracy of data? was rated at 5% during
2007/2008 by Bank staff. By mid-2008 Bank supervision still reported that there was no
MIS standard on reporting, and procurement delays and poor quality technical assistance
were blamed for the MIS problems. Reasons include inadequate resources at the field
level for data collection, unreliable MIS hardware and software (including lack of
internet connection), and insufficient resources at MinDA for procurement and oversight.
To somewhat compensate for the lack of analytical studies, the Task Team commissioned
in 2010 an independent review of the development planning aspects of the SPADA
program, including in two districts in Aceh. 8 Towards the end of the project, the PIU, in
collaboration with the Bank, decided to collect data on levels of school and health center
utilization and to determine the economic rate of return of sub-projects. A full
independent project impact study was finally carried out by MinDA in October-
November 2012 (see Annex 5), which allowed KPI data to be collected. The PMU at

Delivery. 2011.

                                             12
Bappenas carried out an evaluation of the project using the DFID trust fund resources and
lesson learned workshops with stakeholders were held in 2011 in Jakarta and Medan. The
DFID trust funds also generated ten relevant analytical studies and evaluations on various
aspects of post-disaster governance and conflict mitigation. Together, these attempts from
2010 onwards allowed sufficient data to be collected to track indicators in the project
results framework. As a result, it is possible to show the achievement of the PDO using
the KPIs. However, this was achieved not through the M&E component designed into the
project per se but through actions supported by associated trust funds.

Utilization. MinDA’s monitoring deficiencies adversely affected the availability of
progress reports from MinDA to the Bank. Annual “clinics? to improve the MIS were
organized by the Bank between 2007 and 2010, and there were also special weekly
clinics held in 2010 and 2011. The MIS reached only 30% of data availability and
accuracy in 2009, but had improved to more than 85% by project closing in 2011. The
utilization of the MIS was limited until the later stages of the project when data
availability and accuracy had improved. During project hand-over in 2011, training was
provided to local governments in the utilization of the MIS, and the full data set was
handed over to respective district governments (Bappeda).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental Safeguards. Project appraisal had concluded that the small-scale
construction or rehabilitation sub-projects financed by SPADA would have minor
environmental impacts only. This assumption was based on the experience and review of
earlier CDD projects, particularly the KDP series of projects. Similar to these projects,
environmental impacts were to be mitigated and managed through a checklist approach,
supplemented by a negative list of known, potentially damaging, types of sub-projects.
Implementation of these mitigation measures was to be the responsibility of technical
facilitators at the district level, and relevant training was to be provided. However, there
are limited records of any monitoring that may have been done, and there are also no
reports of any environmental problems or complaints arising during implementation.
Environmental supervision and monitoring began rather late for the SPADA projects, and
there was only one training event for environmental safeguards, held by the Bank in 2011.

Social Safeguards. The PAD had proposed to use guidelines for land acquisition – the
major potential social issue in CDD projects – as had been used, and refined over the
years by the KDP projects. These guidelines were incorporated into the project operating
manual: two methods were allowed and well socialized, i.e. voluntary land donation, or
donation with compensation, and consultation was required, and also a record of
donations and associated agreements. However, no records are available of any
systematic monitoring of land acquisition. There were some complaints through the
complaints handling system related to land acquisition but they are reported as resolved.
Appraisal had concluded that there were no indigenous people (IP) in Aceh and the entire
population of Nias island was considered to be indigenous, thus there were no IP issues to
be addressed in the project.




                                            13
Procurement. Procurement performance was initially very poor with only a few packages
finalized according to the procurement schedule, and many delayed by up to a year and
frequently with more than two amendments. The packages for procurement and FM
support were contracted more than two years behind schedule, and subsequently had to
be procured again because the selected firm was debarred. And five packages (including
some monitoring/evaluation activities) were dropped altogether because, owing to delay,
they were either not relevant to project activities anymore or the MTR had recommended
their cancellation. The causes for the poor procurement performance were: (i) the
complexity of the procedures; (ii) the lack of experience and technical skills of MinDA
staff who were new to World Bank processes; and (iii) insufficient capacity (although the
Bank provided procurement training in 2007 and 2008, and MinDA in 2010). The
procurement delays and cancellations of mainly technical assistance packages had
adverse impacts on the progress and quality of project implementation. Mitigation actions
by the Bank only started to take effect in late 2008, when disbursement figures began to
normalize. By 2010, procurement performance had improved sufficiently to give the
project a rating of “Moderately Satisfactory?.

Financial Management, including Audits and Complaints Handling. Financial
management (FM) had been identified as high risk and mitigation measures had been
proposed in the PAD, but the performance of FM throughout much of the project
implementation was poor. By November 2007, MinDA had not submitted any financial
monitoring reports since the grant became effective. The Bank urged that an individual
FM specialist consultant be appointed to assist on all FM aspects of the project. FM
training at the community level was either inadequate or not done. Late procurement and
the low quality of technical assistance contributed to the poor performance of FM, and
poor FM was one of the causes of the moderately unsatisfactory rating of the project in
2008. In early 2009, the Bank again recommended to address FM problems with
additional training and technical assistance. Funds were allocated for independent project
audits, but not used because MinDA preferred to use GoI auditors. Audit findings related
mainly to the interpretation of tax liability by local governments. The complaints
handling system – modeled on the system used by the KDP projects – was the core of the
anti-corruption plan and did demonstrate effectiveness in reducing fraud and applying
sanctions, such as dismissal of staff and / or legal action, especially if misused funds are
not returned. Overall, the rate of follow-up and resolution for complaints was high and
reached almost 100% by grant closing. It is unfortunate that this system – used in a
number of CDD projects over the years – is solely project-based and not established
within government structures 9. By mid-2011, with additional attention from the Bank
task team and responsiveness by MinDA (including appointment of key additional TA),




9
  In this context it is important to note that in 2011 the Bank, through the PSF office, has initiated
discussions with government with aim of working with the national Corruption Eradication Commission
(KPK) to further reduce fraud and misuse of funds in all CDD projects in the Bank’s Indonesia portfolio.
The National Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) and the National Steering Team for PNPM (Pokja
Pengendali PNPM) is conducting a media campaign to build awareness and socialization, including
positive lessons from SPADA.

                                                  14
financial performance improved sufficiently to give the project a FM rating of
“Moderately Satisfactory?.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
In collaboration with local governments project documentation and inventory of physical
assets were completed by December 2011, and infrastructure projects were formally
handed over by the Minister of Disadvantaged Areas to the respective local governments
in early 2012. All districts committed themselves to provide O&M budgets in 2012-13
after project closure. Training in infrastructure maintenance was provided to local
government units and community groups, and a manual on O&M distributed to all project
stakeholders. Based on what in the end was a well operating MIS system. MinDA has
also committed itself to incorporate SPADA’s MIS system in their regular tracking of
disadvantaged areas. A free-standing project supported through the national budget by
MinDA (“Bedah Desa?) is using similar approaches to SPADA by providing block grants
to communities to meet their basic development needs. Administrative systems are also
based on SPADA. Finally, reforms achieved through LGSP and EGA that led to new
policies and regulations (for participatory planning, performance-based budgeting, and
improved public financial management) in ten districts are likely to be sustained, and
local businesses in the target districts are expected to continue to benefit better access,
simplified procedures and the “one stop shop? when obtaining business licenses.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project’s objectives were highly relevant to Indonesia’s priorities in the critical
period after the tsunami and earthquakes in Aceh and Nias in 2004, especially since they
focused not only on the recovery of disaster-affected areas, but also aimed to strengthen
governance, promote growth and improve service delivery through the local district
governments. This was highly relevant in both regions because they had been neglected
developmentally, Aceh because of the armed conflict, and Nias due to its remoteness.
The MTR in February 2009 reconfirmed the relevance of the project’s objectives and
design while attempting to improve implementation performance. In addition to the
broadly applicable objectives and in view of the post-conflict situation in Aceh, the
project also sought to increase the use of dispute resolution services – highly relevant in
Aceh where a fragile peace had been attained in 2005.

The CDD approach to investing in community assets and improving participatory
planning was also highly relevant, and provided much-needed community infrastructure
and support for rural livelihoods, while building trust in government processes. SPADA
showed that communities, given resources and support, can meet a range of their own
development needs even within sectors such as basic health care and education. However,
this needs also to be matched with supply-side responses, such as done by the project at
its best: linking up with local government sectoral agencies and getting the commitment
of local legislative councils to improve budget allocations.



                                            15
The project design and implementation was also highly relevant since they focused on
several key areas of the Bank’s 2009 – 2012 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Indonesia, namely (i) community development, (ii) sub-national government institutions
and systems, and (iii) infrastructure. In fact, “the centerpiece of Bank engagement has
been a long-term relationship providing knowledge and financing services to the PNPM
program. Institution building is a fundamental part of Bank support for PNPM, with a
wide range of activities to strengthen accountability and enhance capacity at the
community level.? 10 As SPADA was part of the PNPM Mandiri projectsy, it was fully
relevant to the CPS.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The project has largely achieved its PDO as per the following:

      a. Local-level governance was strengthened through the project’s contribution to
         the rebuilding and strengthening of district governments that had been disrupted
         by the tsunami and decades of armed conflict. 100 percent of districts have school
         committees and use the Musrenbang participatory planning process. The
         participatory planning process allowed community groups to identify their real
         needs and enabled local governments to accommodate these priorities.
         Specifically the local planning boards (Bappeda) and the three technical agencies
         responsible for project activities (Public Works, Education and Health) were
         strengthened by the project. All participating districts report use of participatory
         planning processes and the concept of participatory “technical review teams?.

      b. Growth was improved as measured by an increase of 90 percent in business
         registration in the target districts. Through the establishment of one stop service
         shops (OSS) for business licenses, local businesses benefited from better access,
         simplified procedures and requirements, and less time and money spent when
         obtaining business licenses. The one stop shops are still in operation in 2012. The
         establishment of “Forum Daerah UKM? (district forum for small and medium
         scale enterprises) in the target districts enhanced the capacity of the SMEs to
         organize themselves, have a better policy dialogue with local authorities, and
         advocate for local economic governance reform. Several local regulations were
         revised to reduce the costs of doing business for SMEs.

      c. Access to basic public services was improved. 91 percent of respondents
         reported satisfaction with education services provided by the project; 89 percent
         with health services; and 98 percent classified infrastructure sub-projects as
         “good? or “satisfactory?. Almost 10,000 teachers and 4,500 health workers
         received training, and primary school enrollment rates increased drastically,
         although the project team acknowledges that, for this last indicator, SPADA was
         one contributor amongst others.

     Verbatim quote from the Indonesia CPS Progress Report 2009 – 2012, dated February 8, 2011.
                                                16
     d. Post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, improved justice and community
        cohesion was promoted through training of community legal advisors in five
        districts (the target was three) and more than 2,300 persons were provided direct
        legal assistance through the project. An estimated 230,000 vulnerable women,
        internally displaced persons (IDP) and ex-combatants were provided financial
        support and technical assistance to rebuild their lives.

SPADA was one of many development projects active in Aceh in the aftermath of the
2004 disaster, and therefore cannot claim sole responsibility for some achievements
relating to more ‘upstream’ outcome areas, where broader exogenous factors were also at
play. Nonetheless, the project benefitted 29% of the total population in the participating
districts (the target was 30%), where better access to water, markets, and education, and
improvement in the health of young children and mothers is reported.

3.3 Efficiency
In December 2011 and June 2012, the SPADA PIU conducted an assessment of a small
selected sample 11 of typical infrastructure sub-projects to determine the actual EIRR.
Results indicate that average EIRRs for SPADA Aceh-Nias projects are approximately
31.44%, with higher values for roads, bridges and clean water projects, and lower values
for irrigation/drainage and public toilet projects. These EIRR levels are roughly
commensurate - when adjusted to similar time horizons - with EIRR levels calculated for
similar subprojects completed by the PNPM Rural program in seven provinces in 2004
and 2012. Similar patterns were also found in these previous PNPM-Rural studies, where
EIRR levels were higher for road/bridge and clean water projects, and slightly lower for
irrigation/drainage projects. Although based on a relatively small sample, the SPADA
Aceh-Nias results suggest substantive net economic benefits, well above the targeted
values. Greater efficiency was also achieved through the use of village labor and
construction management in villages compared to similar, contractor-built infrastructure.
Although no specific study was made in SPADA, evaluations of KPD/PNPM had shown
that, on average, community-implemented infrastructure projects cost 30 to 50% less than
those executed by contractors.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project was highly relevant in all regards for the post-disaster and post-conflict
situation in Aceh and Nias, and was also fully relevant to the Indonesia Country
Partnership Strategy, as noted above. Results demonstrate that the physical investments
achieved a high degree of efficiency, and that SPADA Aceh-Nias met all three PDO
indicator targets and 18 out of 21 intermediate outcome indicators. Given the broad
range of assistance provided to Aceh after the tsunami and peace process, including
sectoral initiatives, SPADA alone may not have been the sole contributor to some of the
PDO indicators. Therefore, while the figures indicated are accurate, they are not derived


11
  15 sub-projects – including road/bridge, water supply and irrigation – were selected; they represent 3.5%
of the total number of sub-projects and about 5.2% of the total amount spent on infrastructure. The sample
included sub-projects from six districts, five in Aceh and one in Nias.

                                                   17
from methodologies for which attribution can be statistically verified or judged to be as a
result of the SPADA intervention alone. Given this, the project outcome rating is rated as
MS.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Although not a formal objective, nor measured directly in its narrowest income
dimension, the project is likely to have significant poverty impacts as it was targeted to
poor, disadvantaged and post-disaster areas, all with high rates of poverty incidence.
SPADA Aceh-Nias improved local infrastructure and services, the quality of basic health
and education, and also promoted small business growth and thereby employment
creation. Women’s participation in planning and decision meetings averaged 30%. The
BRR activities to assist conflict victims (including ex-combatants) that were supported by
a SPADA-linked trust fund, contributed towards improving community cohesion.
SPADA was also found to increase the variation of community proposals, adding other
community concerns to the ‘general CDD project pattern’ of village roads and bridges. 12

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
In addition to the achievements listed under Section 3.2, institutional change and
strengthening happened at the district level in: (i) those ten districts that benefited from
the LGSP and improved participatory planning, assets-based budgeting and financial
management; and, (ii) the five districts that participated in the EGA program for
simplifying the cumbersome registration procedures for small businesses, such as the
one-stop-shop that are still operating. At grant closing, MinDA projected that the new
policies will likely be sustained and that the skills and capacities acquired will assure
longer term benefits from these reforms. This was also confirmed by joint missions to
Aceh in December 2011 and August 2012.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Few, if any, unintended outcomes were identified, but feedback in stakeholder sessions
would suggest that a project like SPADA raises expectations of a next phase with another
round of grants to satisfy unmet needs of poor and disadvantaged communities. The
PATTIRO study also found that SPADA and PNPM programs with their assured funding
are having a ‘substitution effect’ with regard to community participation in the regular
planning processes at the local level; this is likely due to the minimum level of
accommodation of community proposals in the district budget. This is one of the reasons
why in PNPM and future CDD projects, the new GoI policy of “One Village, One Plan?
will be adhered to.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
In November 2011 and again in February 2012, workshops attended by project staff,
government officials and community representatives were held in Medan and Banda
Aceh respectively, to draw lessons from project implementation. Feedback included:

-   Confirmation of the need to continue funding CDD projects, since villages do not
    have enough funds to cover their development needs;
-   Activities funded through the block grants and planning grants were highly relevant,
    especially rural infrastructure and capacity building of teachers and health workers;
-   Provincial and district planning boards (Bappeda) were effective in their coordination
    role with other technical agencies;
-   Late issuance of central government budget (DIPA) caused poor quality planning and
    implementation of subprojects in the short time that was available;
-   Different schedules of SPADA and regular planning processes led to a lack of
    synergy between project activities and regular government programs;
-   There was very limited community involvement in monitoring project activities, but
    good involvement in planning and implementation;
-   Low quality of consultants/facilitators resulted in inadequate supervision - the latter
    was due to insufficient budget allocation for consultants in a very competitive
    employment environment.

A more detailed report on these workshops can be found in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The public infrastructure funded under the project is likely to be sustained. Sub-projects
were designed and built in a simple and cost effective manner, and are reported as easy
and affordable to operate and maintain. Sub-projects were selected by the involved
communities, increasing stakeholder commitment to future operations. There are
however uncertainties – despite a number of projects and initiatives producing economic
growth – whether Aceh’s economy will continue to flourish. Lastly, even though the
latest provincial election in April 2012 was peaceful, there is a risk that increased levels
of violence and political instability could affect governance and growth outcomes, even
at the local level.


5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

-   The Bank responded quickly to the post-disaster and post-conflict, and adapted the
    design of a relevant emerging project
-   The Bank was successful in mobilizing a large number of grants through multi- and
    bilateral trust funds that supported the PDOs
-   Due to the emergency situation, haste in preparation and multiple stakeholder
    demands, the project, as designed, was too ambitious and attempted to cover too


                                            19
    many diverse activities and locations, including some difficult pilots such as
    improving access to justice, and support for conflict resolution
-   There were too many procurement packages (the splitting of large procurements into
    more manageable packages was done as a mitigation effort in light of the low
    capacity of MinDA; however this also led to a work overload)
-   There were too many performance indicators some of which were difficult to measure,
    those where output targets were set too low, or where no baseline was available or
    properly planned. Furthermore, there were differences between some of the
    intermediary indicators listed in the PAD, the GA and the M&E framework
    developed by the project
-   Implementation was expected to rely on two new and inexperienced government
    agencies (BRR and MinDA), with the risks of this not well addressed

The Bank took on a project under very difficult circumstances and although the high risks
had been identified, not all of them could be effectively mitigated, with the expedited
timeline leading to some shortcomings in implementation and institutional readiness and
inconsistencies in the project documentation..

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

-   Supervision was frequent and intensive and attempted to address the considerable
    number of implementation problems, funded through Bank Executed Trust Funds.
    Findings and recommendations were discussed on a regular basis with GOI’s project
    team
-   Despite the slow and difficult launch of the project, Bank staff persisted in providing
    constructive implementation support under at times difficult conditions in the post-
    disaster areas. Assignment of special Task Team ‘representatives’ in the Bank Office
    in Banda Aceh helped the project to improve its performance
-   Advice and reporting by Bank staff (e.g. through back-to-office reports, aide
    memoires and management letters) was good throughout implementation
-   The availability of a number of trust funds was well used for doing much more
    intense supervision and implementation support. Collaboration with other units (e.g.
    PREM, OSU, PSF’s Field Team) in the missions, supported the task team to
    comprehensively analyze findings and develop recommendations
-   Bank staff worked assiduously on the problem areas, where tensions existed between
    GoI and Bank guidelines, in FM, procurement (especially for mobilizing consultants
    in the field) and poor capacity, but only towards the end of the project, with new
    leadership in MinDA, some success was achieved in overcoming the impediments to
    efficient procurement, good FM and a well-functioning MIS
-   Regular coordination meetings with GOI to monitor and discuss progress of the
    agreed follow-up actions allowed the Task Team and GOI to appropriately identify
    further actions required




                                            20
-   Bank staff may have missed an opportunity at the MTR to decisively improve
    implementation and, in particular, to galvanize attention to the weak execution of the
    M&E framework
-   There was no reporting – and likely no specific monitoring – of the implementation of
    the safeguards mitigation measures set out in the PAD (Note: There were no
    indications that any serious safeguard problems arose during implementation).

Despite the initial problems and procurement delays, the Bank’s supervision efforts and
implementation support helped to slowly improve performance, especially after the MTR.
It significantly improved the way the task team and GOI’s project team worked together
in addressing systematic project issues (e.g. financial management, procurement,
monitoring and reporting, and project sustainability) and in managing project risks. Based
on these considerations, the rating is Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The rating for overall performance is the aggregate of (a) and (b) above.

5.2 Recipient Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

-   GoI was quick to agree with the MDF and the Bank on adapting the SPADA project
    to the urgent needs in Aceh and Nias
-   The appointment of the BRR assured efficient channeling of funds to the local
    governments during the early part of project implementation
-   Bappenas/PMU provided strong guidance and quality enhancement support to
    MinDA
-   GoI provided budget resources for financing the block grants and administrative
    support
-   Release of the central government funds (DIPA) was consistently late with adverse
    effects on project implementation at the sub-district levels
-   A sizable portion of the grant, i.e. about 20%, was returned to the MDF and re-
    programmed because the project was unable to fully utilize them even though an 18-
    month extension was agreed
-   Even though having significant “teething problems?, MinDA and the various levels of
    management consultants gained experience and capacity, and the project disbursed
    fully in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

Although there were delays early during implementation, GoI efforts and performance
were sufficient to overcome the numerous initial difficulties. Based on this consideration,
the rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                            21
-   MinDA, initially as the co-implementing agency (until BRR’s mandate expired in
    April 2009), succeeded to implement the project, and a total of 1,770 infrastructure
    sub-projects and training activities were completed in 19 districts, some of which are
    very remote
-   Key outcomes in education and health system improvements were achieved, and
    some 781 essential infrastructure sub-projects were built
-   The capacity of the provincial planning board (Bappeda) in Aceh was improved
    substantially in terms of overall planning and coordination of district level agencies
-   Women and vulnerable groups were reported to have participated in the planning and
    implementation of the project at the community level
-   The complaints handling system was generally effective in resolving fraud cases
-   After the MTR, MinDA managed to improve implementation performance
    sufficiently to meet the Bank’s pre-conditions for an extension of the closing date
-   Due to their lack of experience and capacity MinDA staff were not able to procure
    consultants services in a timely manner; many packages were delayed - 30% by more
    than a year
-   Procurement, FM and the MIS improved during the latter two years of the project
-   Only limited M&E studies were carried out during project implementation, and no
    base-line study.

Similar to the rating of the Recipient performance, the implementing agency improved
their performance throughout the implementation period, and especially following the
MTR, so that a rating of Moderately Satisfactory is considered appropriate.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The rating for overall Recipient performance is the aggregate of (a) and (b) above. After a
slow start with significant “teething problems?, project performance improved during
project implementation to warrant a “moderately satisfactory? rating over the full period
of the project.

6. Lessons Learned

Adapting a project for post-disaster operation. Following a major natural disaster,
such as the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, it is possible to adapt an approach and implementation
arrangements of a previously designed project, facilitating quick project start-up to
provide urgently needed assistance. It can also attract major sources of multi- and
bilateral grant funding to support the project objectives. However, it is crucial to carefully
draw lessons from the existing project before emulating: challenges arose with SPADA
Aceh-Nias since the nationwide SPADA was too new to fully provide lessons learned,
and the end result was an overly complex project with too many components and
indicators. The new Bank operational policy that has been drafted recently for work in
fragile states and post-conflict settings will be useful for future operations.


                                             22
Working with a new ministry as implementing agency. Project design and appraisal
had identified that institutional weakness of MinDA as a major risk because it was newly
established, lacked experience, without line agencies at the local level, and dependent on
local agencies whose post-disaster capacity was limited. A newly created Ministry,
appointed as the implementing agency of a newly designed and complex project in a
post-disaster area for which they actually have neither a mandate nor the expertise, will
take considerable time to get organized and up to speed with project implementation.
When dealing with a new ministry or implementing agency, additional training, special
consultants and associated implementation support must be provided in the project and by
the Bank’s task team. With the intense support provided by the Bank – only possible
through additional trust funds - MinDA eventually managed to provide quality project
delivery.

Trust fund support. Implementation of a complex project dealing with low-capacity
stakeholders cannot rely solely on Bank budget for effective implementation support.
SPADA Aceh-Nias would likely have been a failed project without the additional support
afforded by trust funds. These grants allowed frequent and comprehensive
implementation support involving specialist resources. However, when using a large
number of trust funds, coordination and integration of trust-funded activities is difficult to
achieve, especially at the national level. Also, government ownership in SPADA turned
out to be low since the trust-funded activities were implemented by third parties without
clear links and reporting channels to government agencies. The project missed
opportunities to take full advantage of the various trust funds and achieve greater synergy
and benefits by linking the EGA, LGSP and DFID project closer to the main SPADA
core activities, and more broadly incorporating the achievements in all districts.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Recipient/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Recipient/Implementing agencies
Both MinDA (PIU) and Bappenas (PMU) have in their written comments to the draft ICR
provided broad agreement with the ICR. They have reported that the main issues during
implementation were: (i) Aide Memoire follow-up was not always done and updated; (ii)
several activities were planned by the SPADA task team using local budget financing but
were not properly communicated right from the start; (iii) these activities were not
allocated in the DIPA (on-budget) which made implementation difficult; (iii) the
procurement committee lacked support for procurement processes as advice was based on
Bank guidelines and did not take GoI guidelines into consideration; (iv) delays in project
effectiveness reduced initial performance; and (v) advice was provided by the task team
without reference to the state administration process - this created difficulties with
implementation. These comments reflect the tension that existed throughout the project
between the Bank’s fiduciary requirements and the reliance among local governments on
country systems. In future projects, it is recommended that clarifications and capacity
building to local governments is done early in the implementation stage.

assessed for quality, and 98% of all outputs were rated as “good? or “satisfactory?. The
ratings of sub-project quality are based on inspections by a local certification team that
involved the communities concerned. In terms of outcomes for Component A, 1,770
activities were implemented that focused on improving the overall quality of education
and health services in response to community demand in Aceh and Nias.

Component 2 – Planning Grants
The outputs under this component were mainly planning activities to support the
utilization of block grants. Total planning grant utilized in the main SPADA project (TF-
057955) was US$ 310,006 (77% of grant allocated) since according to the Recipient’s
PCR the project used national budget funds during the early years of project
implementation. Total recipient’s contribution for this allocation was US$ 473,571 (60%
of total planning grant). The planning activities supported by this grant included district
technical review meetings, decision meeting forums, and capacity building to support the
planning activities.

Component 3 – Implementation Support
This component financed consultants at the national, provincial and district levels. In
Aceh, due to large numbers of participating districts, the number of provincial consultants
was adjusted to support the responsibilities of PIU- MinDA. The district level consultants
worked as facilitators and liaison with KDP to collect the still unfunded KDP sub-

                                            27
districts needs and proposals. Below is the number of consultants that supported SPADA
Aceh Nias. Note that some consultant services for activities such as private sector
development, mediation and community legal empowerment and conflict monitoring,
were cancelled due to late procurement process.

Component 4 – Monitoring, Evaluation, and Studies
This component was not implemented. The Recipient utilized local budget resources to
support the monitoring and evaluation studies. With support from DFID’s grant, the
PMU-Bappenas prepared the monitoring and evaluation framework and manual. In late
2009, they also conducted an analysis of a small sample of health and education sub-
projects to assessment stakeholders’ (see Annex 2b on summary of linked trust funds for
detailed information). Prior to project closing in December 2012, MinDA committed to
conduct a rapid assessment of EIRR, health and education indicators in six districts of
Aceh and one district in Nias in order to complement the post-completion output study
that was scheduled for October-November 2012; it was financed by the nationwide
SPADA project.

                                          (EGA)
The objective of this project, implemented by the Asia Foundation, was to support Indonesia’s post-
earthquake and tsunami reconstruction and rehabilitation program by improving the local business climate
in selected districts in Aceh by streamlining business regulations and strengthening businesses’ capacity to
advocate for change. The project comprised four components: (i) assessment of economic governance and
regulatory environment, or the “Economic Governance Index (EGI) Component?, implemented in all 23
local governments in Aceh, (ii) streamlined business licensing and registration, or the “One Stop Shop
(OSS) Component?, piloted in five districts in Aceh, (iii) improved district regulatory review process, or
the “Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) Component?, and (iv) improved advocacy through small and
medium enterprise (SME) networks, or the “SME Component?.

Outcomes: Overall, the EGA program was implemented successfully and achieved its objectives. Through
the establishment of the OSS, local businesses in the five participating districts benefited from better
access, simplified procedures and requirements, and less time and money spent when obtaining business
licenses. The introduction of the RIA method improved the capacity of the LGs (both the executive and the
legislative) to prepare and review local regulations. Based on the RIA results, several local regulations
were revised to reduce the costs of doing business, particularly for SMEs. And the establishment of
“Forum Daerah UKM? (district forum for SMEs) in five districts enhanced the capacity of the SMEs to
organize themselves, have a better policy dialogue with the LGs, and advocate for local economic
governance reform.

Note: EGA was co-funded by a US$1.5 million DFID grant (TF-090789) linked to the nationwide
SPADA, with the same objectives and outcomes; US$1,380,542 were disbursed when that TF closed on
31/12/2009.

                                          Poor
This project extended the support that USAID had been providing under the nationwide Local Government
Support Program (LGSP) to five post-disaster districts in Aceh since September 2005. The MDF grant
supported an expansion of the scope to eleven districts and sought to integrate the LGSP activities into the
SPADA good governance program. The objectives of the project, implemented by the Research Triangle
Institute (RTI), were to assist districts to: (i) strengthen capacity and anchor bottom-up planning in
government institutions and civil society organizations, with a particular focus on local ability to prepare
social and infrastructure projects and deliver quality public service development programs, (ii) improve
budgeting, accounting and assets management, (iii) strengthen local councils, focusing on budgeting,
oversight, legislation and outreach to constituents, (iv) strengthen civil society through citizen engagement
in planning and budgeting, drafting of local regulations, and public service advocacy and monitoring, and
(v) improve public services by restoring basic services, and by improving access, transparency and
accountability.

Outcomes: USAID funding for LGSP had launched the good governance program, and LGs, DPRDs and
citizen groups worked together to experiment and build trust. Subsequently, MDF/SPADA funds permitted
expansion to the east coast of Aceh, leading to learning across Aceh and ultimately underwriting many of
the innovative practices emerging in the final 18 months of the program. As a result, a total of ten districts

                                                     29
(i) used participatory planning processes for budgeting development activities, (ii) developed a
performance-based budget, and (iii) improved public financial management. A few of the LGs enacted
policies and regulations for community participation in planning, decision-making and oversight, and
hundreds of legislators, LG staff and civil society members were trained in various aspects of improving
local governance. LGSP-Aceh USAID-MDF/SPADA was an innovative partnership of donors and local
partners, with LGSP being a good channel for collaboration.

                                          Project 13
The purpose of this project, which listed the Bank as the “Recipient? and was partly implemented by the
Bank, was to complement and co-finance the SPADA project. The objectives of this project were: (a)
strengthening the capacity-building components of SPADA Aceh-Nias to ensure the sustainability and
impact of investments; (b) helping to ensure that different vulnerable groups – who were often
marginalized in the development processes – were included, and (c) addressing specific tsunami and
conflict recovery needs in the dynamic war-to-peace transition context in Aceh. There were 12 ‘child’ trust
funds under this grant and eight of them directly supported the PDO of SPADA Aceh Nias. These child
trust funds are described further below in table III.1 to III.8.

Outcomes: Overall, implementation of most grant activities, particularly those supporting the "satellite?
activities (access to justice, PSD strengthening, support for vulnerable groups), was satisfactory, and was
rated as such by the donor agency (DFID). Targets were achieved, except for two government-executed
activities: Mediation and Community Legal Empowerment (MCLE) and Support to Internally Displaced
People (IDP). Implementation of these activities failed due to broader procurement issues with the SPADA
program. The project also generated ten analytical studies and evaluations. The Bank provided adequate
and timely support to local government and other implementing partners in the conduct of Recipient-
executed activities, and fulfilled tasks and responsibilities related to overall program secretariat,
supervision and M&E (targets for Bank-executed activities were met). A follow-on project, Consolidating
Peaceful Development in Aceh (CPDA) funded by the Netherlands and AusAID has continued some of
the initiatives started by this project, such as addressing post-conflict vulnerabilities, improving access to
justice, and capacity-building assistance to local governments and civil society.

Note: The summary of outcomes above draws from a more detailed assessment of the implementation of
this TF that can be found in the separate Implementation Completion Memorandum (ICM) for TF-070672.

This latter DFID trust fund comprised eight Recipient-executed TFs and four Bank-
executed TFs that directly supported the PDO of this project. Details on these TFs are
presented below.

   Different from the other two TFs described above, this TF funded by DFID, was not formally
linked to the SPADA Aceh-Nias and therefore is not reflected in the data sheet. However, the
project was clearly a closely related and directly supporting parallel operation.

                                                Governance in Aceh (EGA)
The objective of this project, implemented by the Asia Foundation, was to support Indonesia’s post-
earthquake and tsunami reconstruction and rehabilitation program by improving the local business climate
in selected districts in Aceh by streamlining business regulations and strengthening businesses’ capacity to
advocate for change. The project comprised four components: (i) assessment of economic governance and
regulatory environment, or the “Economic Governance Index (EGI) Component?, implemented in all 23
local governments in Aceh, (ii) streamlined business licensing and registration, or the “One Stop Shop
(OSS) Component?, piloted in five districts in Aceh, (iii) improved district regulatory review process, or
the “Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) Component?, and (iv) improved advocacy through small and
medium enterprise (SME) networks, or the “SME Component?.

Outcomes: The project was linked with a similar project funded by MDF (see above on TF-093074):
some of the objectives were achieved through DFID support and the project was implemented successfully
and achieved its objectives. Four project components were implemented using DFIF support. The first
assessment of economic governance and regulatory environments covering 23 districts in Aceh was
carried out in 2008. The outcomes of this component were achieved through MDF support. The second
component – One Stop Shop for Business Licensing – used five baseline assessments of district level
licensing; it then delivered training for 212 staff of One-Stop Service centers. The materials provided
focused on how to use OSS to provide better services and make them work effectively. The objective of
this component was also achieved with MDF support. The third component improved district regulatory
processes and was delivered by introducing Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) methods as tools to
review current local regulation that had been identified as obstacles to a good business enabling
environment at the project locations. 10 RIA statements where produced from five project locations as an
input for revising the existing local regulations. At the end of the project, ten draft local regulations related
to nuisance and construction permits and traditional market regulations were produced, and regulatory
impact assessment statement recommendations were included in the local legislation program for 2010 and
2011. Two districts – Aceh Tenggara and Aceh Barat Daya – issued district head decrees to institutionalize
RIA as part of their regular regulation-making process. The last component for strengthening SME
associations was fully funded by MDF.

The objective of this project, implemented by Bappenas, was to support the Government of Indonesia in
preparing a detailed action plan to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity of the Ministry of
National Development Planning (Bappenas) and the Ministry of Development for Disadvantage Areas in
implementing the Support for Poor and Disadvantage Areas Project (SPADA Project).

Outcome: A Monitoring and Evaluation framework and manual were produced, introduced, and used;
also a functioning MIS system was established. Capacity has been increased through formal training,
workshops and on-the job training. The overall objective of strengthening monitoring and evaluation
capacity of Bappenas and MinDA has been partially achieved. The outputs include: (a) a manual on
SPADA monitoring and evaluation, including testing the manual in 7 SPADA provinces and 10 districts,
and (b) a study on SPADA acceptance and effectiveness levels through EIRR analysis and clients’
satisfaction surveys.

The objective of this project, implemented by The Asia Foundation, was to contribute to gender equality in
Aceh by increasing women's civic participation and by strengthening gender justice in selected villages
(Empowering Women in Aceh, or EWA).

Outcome: 32 Syariah court judges trained to evaluate obstacles to women’s access to justice in their
jurisdiction, two rounds of gender training was conducted with 32 Syariah court judges, who subsequently
conducted outreach programs to women's groups in 4 districts. A reference book and documents to help
evaluate and increase awareness of gender sensitivity in religious and civil court decisions was published
and disseminated (i.e., 3,500 booklets on women's legal issues, 3,000 stickers, and 1,500 calendars). The
outcome is likely to be sustainable across most areas. Program beneficiaries were more likely to engage
government to access services and actively participate in Musrenbang planning meeting, local leader
elections, school committee and PNPM processes. Increases in knowledge and attitude amongst program
beneficiaries indicate they will continue to be more pro-active in engaging government and other
stakeholders. The work with the Shariah Court has been entrenched into the Court's training and
performance assessment mechanisms. Additional resources are being considered to the CPCRS in order to
strengthen its sustainability.

                                               Program
The objective of this project, implemented by International Organization for Migration, was to provide
direct medical and psycho-social assistance focused on mental health.

Outcome: The program provided general medical services to 5,992 patients, and mental health care to
1,530 patients (including 980 women). The program provided additional livelihood support to 200 patients
(142 women). The final impact evaluation of the program conducted by Harvard Medical School shows
that the mental health outreach program was highly effective in treating the primary mental health
symptoms suffered by patients, with 83 % of them reporting improvements. The study shows that the
treatment of mental health problems had dramatic effects on the economic functioning of patients and their
families, enabling patients to return to work and reducing the time and money families must invest in
caring for a family member with a mental health problem. 67% of patients reported being more able to
work, and the average number of hours worked per week per patient went from 29 prior to treatment to 40
hours or more after treatment. The pilot study of providing combined mental health care and livelihood aid
to individuals shows greater improvements in psychiatric symptoms for patients receiving livelihood
support compared to those receiving mental health care alone, and even greater benefits in their ability to
work and improvement in the economic levels of their family. The study thus indicates a significant
leveraging effect of combining mental health and livelihood interventions.

                                               Legal Empowerment (WLE)
The objective of this project, implemented by Relawan Perempuan untuk Kemanusiaan, was to increase
women's access to justice, e.g.: (1) to increase women's legal knowledge; (2) to strengthen the capacity of
local legal and other related institutions in the formal and informal sectors to address women's legal issues;
and (3) to increase women's policy advocacy and policy reform.

Outcomes: Paralegals in 5 districts were trained and they are providing assistance to women's groups
(avg. size 35) in 23 sub-districts and 67 villages (total of more than 2,300 women). In addition, formal

                                                     32
legal support was provided in 44 cases, some with multiple beneficiaries, and 85 formal legal dialogues
were conducted with community members throughout program locations. The overall objectives of the
program were met, despite the shortened timeframe. At the community level sustainability is likely as
trained paralegals were from the villages themselves and as such will remain resources on these issues
within the village. At an institutional level, the program developed the capacity of the implementing NGOs
to administer grants and implement programs. As a result two of the four NGOs involved in implementing
the program have subsequently been able to access resources from other donors.

The objective of this program, implemented by the Forum LSM Aceh, was to enhance the capacity of
PNPM Rural and SPADA facilitators in Aceh to deal with conflict emerging from the community
development and participatory planning project.

Outcome: 408 PNPM (including SPADA) facilitators, and an additional 405 village leaders (i.e. a total of
813), including village heads and youth representatives, were trained in conflict mediation, leadership, and
civic education in October 2009. This output used about half of the total DFID funds. Core training was
planned to be followed by a round of advanced training before the end of the grant. Delays in
implementation, mostly due to procedural delays on the government side, led to the core training being
held only in October 2009, towards the end of the project Advanced training could therefore not happen
before the closing of the grant.

                                              Peacebuilding II
The objective of this project, implemented by Search for Common Ground Indonesia (SFCGI), was to (i)
establish an enhanced platform for youth in Aceh to explore issues affecting reconciliation and conflict
transformation in a constructive and solutions-oriented way, (ii) enhance the capacity and sustainability of
media in Aceh to play more active role in reconciliation and peace-building processes, and (iii) increase
collaboration between youth, their communities and other relevant stakeholders.

Outcomes: Overall, the project achieved its objectives but it fell somewhat short of its intended objective
to stimulate dialogue between youth and other Acehnese stakeholders, due to low stakeholder turnout for
the Youth View Report presentation. Although the program was able to mobilize and stimulate informal
youth mechanisms for engagement, the youth of the participants was also a liability in the sense that
cultural norms constrained them from engaging with older generations effectively. If youth are going to
engage in the democratization and peace building process, more efforts need to be made to prepare them
for that role. It would be necessary to assist the nascent “Aceh Youth Forum? and youth network with
development and capacity building to give it an opportunity to implement the crucial points of the Aceh
Youth Forum Declaration to ensure its sustainability, However, SFCGI was unable to mobilize donor
support to finance follow-up activities.

Outcomes: No outcomes have been achieved as the entire grant was canceled. The procurement for
consultant services for implementing this activity was delayed, and following the MTR, this activity was
dropped because it did not fit the project time line. Alternative resources were identified to implement the
activity in accordance with the original design after this grant’s closing date. The additional funds were
provided by the Justice for the Poor Program.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A sample of about 30 SPADA Aceh-Nias infrastructure subprojects was used for EIRR
calculations in 2012. These subprojects represent about three percent of all subprojects.
They were chosen to roughly represent the overall sub-project mix in SPADA Aceh-Nias
and were analyzed according to an EIRR methodology developed by the KDP/PNPM
projects.

Results indicate that the average EIRR for SPADA Aceh-Nias sub-projects is 31.44%,
with higher values for road & bridge and water supply sub-projects, and lower values for
irrigation and drainage and public toilet sub-projects.

These EIRRs are roughly equivalent to EIRRs calculated for similar subprojects
completed by PNPM Rural in East and Central Java, South and West Sulawesi, West
Kalimantan, North Sumatera, and NTT provinces in 2004 and 2012 (see Torrens 2005
and World Bank 2012). The patterns are also similar to these previous PNPM-Rural
studies, where EIRR levels were higher for road & bridge and water supply projects, and
slightly lower for irrigation and drainage projects.

This and previous EIRR studies have been relatively expensive given the methodology's
preference for technical specialists (engineers and economists) to both gather data from
the field and perform the EIRR analysis and calculations. Additionally, the usefulness of
the EIRR methodology itself to reliably capture the actual gains from these types of
community-planned and community-built small-scale infrastructure projects is
increasingly being called into question. Given these concerns, but equally importantly
because the SPADA Aceh-Nias results from the smaller sample conform broadly to
previous analyses, the Task Team and MinDA decided not to launch a full-scale,
SPADA-wide EIRR.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1. Study Objective
This study collects beneficiary satisfaction information in Aceh and Nias provinces in
order to summarize the performance of the SPADA initiative against its achievement
indicators and targets. The study focuses on satisfaction with the provision of health and
education services provided through, or financed in part by, SPADA.

2. Study Design
The beneficiary survey is quantitative in nature: by sampling a roughly representative set
of confirmed project beneficiaries, it will provide the information necessary to estimate
average beneficiary satisfaction. This estimate is limited, however, by both SPADA
operational details and study design. Firstly, baseline, pre-project satisfaction information
does not exist. Secondly, SPADA typically finances ongoing services and programs (in
health and education) delivered by local governments and service providers and in so
doing expands the coverage of these previously existing services. For both reasons, the
study as designed cannot measure the impact of the SPADA program against a valid
counterfactual. In order to ensure that satisfaction as measured can be attributed to
particular SPADA projects (rather than just general or ongoing activities in a locality),
the survey instruments and sampling strategy will generate enough identifying
information to link confirmed beneficiaries with particular projects and locations.

3. District Coverage
Data collection (carried out by Ceriajasa Engineering Consultants) was completed in the
week 9 to 17 October, 2012 in six districts in Aceh – Aceh Besar, Pidie, Aceh Barat,
Aceh Tamiang, Aceh Selatan, and Aceh Tenggara –and 1 district –Nias Selatan – on Nias
island. These districts were selected purposively by PIU for their confirmed delivery of
education and health services supported by SPADA block grants – see below.

4. Samples
Many SPADA-supported projects are quite small in geographic or population coverage
and are specific to needs and capacities of each locality, so comparability between
SPADA-supported projects is not always straightforward. In order to achieve a measure
of performance that is as general as possible – a measure that could reasonably represent
performance across all SPADA-supported initiatives – and to be able to compare between
geographic regions, the study sampled only projects that are widely implemented in
nearly all Nias and Aceh kabupaten. SPADA MIS data indicates only two such
projects/services –Desa Siaga (training for health provider and cadre) and interactive
learning (training for teachers) – are so general, so these two project types were sampled
in all study regions.

In order to reduce the influence of experience with goods, services, and initiatives
provided without SPADA support (but which nonetheless may be complements to, or
substitutes for, SPADA-supported initiatives), the study design randomly selects
confirmed participants in each type of project. For education-related projects, three

                                             38
primary school teachers and one junior high school teacher (from different schools) were
sampled and interviewed in each district. For each teacher sampled, 25 students who
learn from that teacher were interviewed. For health-related projects, three midwives
were sampled for interview. For each midwife selected, the study contacted for interview
one or two village health posts (Posyandu) where the midwife is confirmed to practice.
For each midwife and associated Posyandu thus contacted, the study interviewed ten
patients who are confirmed recipients of health services from those providers. The total
number of providers and end-users sampled is adjusted based on the expected number of
participants in each program in each region. The expected number of participants in each
program in each region has not previously been estimated, so the study design included a
data collection specifically to estimate these participation rates.

5. Method of Analyses
The analysis estimates rates of satisfaction by project type, by geographic region, and by
participant type (as well as overall satisfaction across all participants contacted). As the
survey instrument includes several distinct (but not independent) questions regarding
satisfaction with different, each distinct question and response will be weighted in order
to estimate average satisfaction. The formulation of these weights is part of the analytic
program and the analysis will include a section on their derivation. The study provides
information about individual, household, and village-level factors influencing beneficiary
satisfaction to provide SPADA implementers and practitioners with advice on more
effective implementation.

6. Result
The results showed positive impacts, as follows: The draft report of the output study
survey shows that, on average, 87.5% of patients were satisfied with health services
provided by midwives and cadres trained by the project. And 91% of students were
satisfied with education services provided by teachers trained by the project.

The results show that the services needed by patients were prenatal, immunization,
childbirth and general health checkup. The percentage for health services satisfaction was
derived from patients who were very satisfied and satisfied with their midwives and
cadres (see Table 5.1). The survey sample included 215 patients served by midwives and
215 patients served by cadres.

For the project’s education component, the study focused on levels understanding shown
by students to teaching methods in three majors: Indonesian, physics, and mathematics.
The percentage for education services satisfaction was derived from student’s perception
of the teacher’s explanation, e.g., very clear and clear. There were 847 students
interviewed and the results are summarized on the Table 5.2.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1. Multi-stakeholder ICR workshop in February 2012 in Banda Aceh
A stakeholder workshop was held in the World Bank Office in Banda Aceh, the capital of
Aceh Province, on February 16, 2012. About 20 people participated very actively in the
half-day group event; a separate discussion was held later with Bappeda, the provincial
coordination team. Participants provided feedback on what worked and what did not
work during the implementation of SPADA Aceh-Nias. Below is a list of workshop
participants from four districts in Aceh Province who were project stakeholders:
    • District Holding Commitment Officer (SATKER)
    • District Sub-project Implementing Unit (UPKD) for health
    • District Sub-project Implementing Unit (UPKD) for education
    • District Sub-project Implementing Unit (UPKD) for infrastructure
    • District Technical Review Team
    • District Management Team (TPK)
    • District Management Consultant (DMC)
    • School principal, a beneficiary

The participants were divided into two groups by district, and each group discussed and
reflected on three main issues: planning processes, implementation, and sustainability;
the group discussion was facilitated by National Management Consultant staff. Then, the
outputs of the group discussions were brought to the workshop plenum to agree on the
findings. Some personal insights from the stakeholder event are presented below:

Reflections on the Implementation of SPADA Aceh-Nias

    Former District Holding Commitment, Aceh Jaya District:
    “The planning process, as set out in the project timeline, was to be finalized within
    two months. This limited amount of time did not allow the technical review team to
    produce a good technical and financial proposal; moreover, public consultation was
    also not properly facilitated. In future, more time should be allowed for planning,
    and we would not need a consultat or facilitator if adequate time were given to us.?

    School Principal, Aceh Jaya District:
   “In the past, projects fund were mainly for infrastructure improvements but there
   were few activities in capacity building to improve the quality of human resources,
   such as training for teachers. We are happy that the SPADA Aceh-Nias project did
   fund capacity building activities, so that teachers received six months of training; this
   had a positive impact on increasing the graduation rate of our students. We hope the
   local government could provide a contribution towards sustainability, especially
   through provision of classroom furniture and school equipment. The benefits of the
   SPADA project were acknowledged by the community, the school committee, and the
   students. The training that the teachers received focused on improving teachers’
   understanding of teaching materials, curriculum, methods of instruction, and other
   supporting teaching tools. The real impact was an increase of the graduation rate

                                            41
    from 65% to 85% in Aceh Jaya, and most of the graduated students were
    subsequently accepted by the best schools in the neighborhood. Therefore, the project
    benefits are very significant, and we hope that there will be similar programs in the
    future. We expect to receive local government contributions in the future to sustain
    capacity building of our teachers?.

    District Sub Project Implementing Unit (UPKD) Health, Aceh Besar:
     “There should be inputs, both the technical as well as health considerations, during
    the design stage of any health sub-projects, especially if construction is involved. For
    example, when designing the examination room and the bathroom, as well as during
    the design of the maternity ward and delivery room, they should be close to the
    sterilizer and the room for medical equipment. The infrastructure team should also
    seek advice from the health sector specialist staff to make sure that all health service
    standards are fully met.?

    Former Technical Review Team, Aceh Besar:
    “The positive impact of a sub-project could be seen with the increase of the student
    graduation rate due to the improved quality of teachers, and adequate teaching
    facilities. And in the health sector, where we are facing endemic diseases, such as
    malaria and dengue hemorrhagic fever we hope that more patients can be treated
    with the provision of fogging equipment [for vector control] through the project. The
    critical issue will be the continued supply of chemicals, and the maintenance and
    operational cost of the fogging equipment.?

Summary of Workshop Findings

-   Project socialization was weak, and not all communities and technical agencies,
    received adequate information. Public consultations were facilitated only as
    ceremonial events, and there was a lack of coordination among technical agencies and
    programs.
-   Bappeda, as the lead agency at the province and district levels, were successful in
    ensuring vertical coordination with other technical agencies.
-   The efforts of involving communities in project monitoring were limited;
    communities were mainly involved in sub-project planning and implementation.
-   The late issuance of the central government budgets (DIPA) caused poor quality of
    sub-project planning and implementation. Adequate time for preparing budgets and
    design is required for good quality infrastructure sub-projects.
-   The different implementation schedules of the SPADA program and the regular
    planning processes caused a lack of synergy between SPADA and government
    programs.
-   The selection and composition of Technical Review Teams is a critical factor for
    generating good quality draft proposals that address the problems and needs that were
    identified through the participatory approach. A follow-up public consultation would
    be a good way to finalize the proposals for discussion in the district forum before
    decisions are made


                                            42
-   The issue of project sustainability was not properly socialized at the beginning of the
    project, thus the follow-up for sustainability was rather late. Some of the simpler sub-
    projects can be maintained by the communities, but the follow-up on non-physical
    sub-projects, such as teacher training will be a problem because of the limited budgets
    of local governments, and also because there are no records of past training
    participants.

2. Observations and views of the SPADA Provincial Coordination Team of Aceh
Province provided as part of February 2012 stakeholder workshop in Banda Aceh

Achievement of PDO and implementation:
The SPADA Project supported Aceh’s recovery from conflict and tsunami disaster
through comprehensive problem identification at the community, sub-district and district
levels. The provincial government also provided support for poverty alleviation by
allocating local budget resources to supplement grants at the village level. In the future,
better and wider coverage by socialization should include more provincial stakeholders
since it is key to avoid any misunderstandings on the project concept: all actors need to
know their roles so that they could support project implementation more effectively.

Performance of institutions, quality of maintenance and sustainability:
There was some discussion about political interests and involvement of local
governments and communities in the district forums during planning and implementation.
“Political interests? would help to ensure the availability of local government
contributions for project administration and monitoring, but it could decrease the
opportunities for communities to participate in project implementation, such as during the
decision-making forum for funding and the selection of sub-projects by the community.
Implementation was often by private contractors, and as a result, there were little
community involvement and contributions that would have enhanced sustainability. In
the future, the enforcement of accountability, transparency and good governance in
implementation should be strengthened.

Based on monitoring by government, all sub-projects are well established and the
commitment of local governments is contributing to successful project implementation.
The provincial government will continue to work hard to ensure that all sub-projects are
functioning and will become local assets. There is hope for continued support for all
districts, including also newly established districts. There were bi-weekly meetings with
project stakeholders to discuss problems and find solutions. There was also monitoring
through field visits.

There were issues with the quality of the technical assistance, i.e. the consultants and
facilitators for the project, and overall there was not enough technical assistance. There
were extended periods when important positions, such as the district FM consultants,
were vacant [mainly due to procurement delays]. This problem contributed to the poor
quality of financial reports, an issue identified by the government audit findings.




                                            43
Regarding the project management structure, the project should have been managed and
executed by the province for more effective implementation, such as the implementation
of the BOS program (national program for operational support to schools).

Project Achievements

Planning Process: The bottom-up participatory planning that was introduced by the
SPADA program has increased the confidence of communities in development planning
and implementation; it has given them new hope because their proposals went through
the SPADA planning process, and they were involved all the way through, deciding the
funding priorities and attending various meetings. And they could see the outputs and
benefits of the project in the same year. A positive trend is emerging and communities are
becoming more open in expressing their opinions and aspirations – a critical factor for
successful participatory planning activities involving communities. Participation of
marginalized groups, i.e. the poor and women, met the standard requirements because the
participatory, bottom-up planning process used by SPADA facilitated the involvement of
these groups.

Beneficiaries: The project reached a total of 1,364,561 beneficiaries, or 29% of the total
population in Aceh-Nias (end target 30%). A total of 57% of the beneficiaries are poor.

Major Outputs/intermediate outcomes: The project finalized 1,770 sub-projects
(infrastructure, education, and health) and have been handed over to local governments.
Most of sub-projects categorized as ‘satisfactory’ and ‘acceptable’ (for education sub-
projects, 76% satisfactory and 24% acceptable’; for health sub-projects, 95% satisfactory
and 5% acceptable; while for infrastructure sub-projects, 83% categorized satisfactory,
16% acceptable, and 1% need improvement).

All targeted districts have increased their capacity in procurement and financial
management, while 13 districts (and target 13 districts) have improved their policies and
mechanisms related to local regulation development to support implementation of
transparency and accountability principles. The project facilitated establishment of 19
private sector forums (end target 19 forums).

A total of 59% of village with active participation in school management committees
(end target 40%). Specific study to assess respondent satisfaction for education and
health services provided by the project is to be conducted in August-October 2012.

Development objectives: results for rapid assessment exercise to 23 sub-projects shows
that the average of EIRR is 23% (end target >20%), with average net economic benefit
for each sub-project is IDR 164,865,267, indicating the activities provide positive
economic benefits for the community.

Percentage of children aged 7-12 not attending primary school in Aceh is 4.82% (end
target >5%), and in Nias is 6.36 (end target >11%), while percentage of children aged 13-
15 not attending junior secondary school in Aceh is 23.55% (end target >13%), and in
Nias 50.09% (end target >29%).

Challenges
Adoption of planning approach by local governments: very few local authorities have
adopted the planning process promoted by SPADA. Some factors contributed, including:
(1) time frame for SPADA planning process is not coherent with the time frame for
regular planning process; (2) unclear policies and mechanisms for many of government
agencies at local level to adopt the SPADA planning process.
Sustainability: maintenance and continuity of project activities continue to be the issues
in many districts. Major challenges identified, including: (1) unclear local regulation and
mechanism to continue the activities when the project ended; (2) insufficient local budget
to support the maintenance; (3) inadequate commitment from the local authorities to
adopt the approaches promoted by the project; and (4) lack of capacity of local level
institutions and human resources to continue project activities.

Project Management:
   1. Insufficient ‘socialization’ of project objectives and processes to local
       stakeholders during the initial stage of project (lack of coordination with the
       locals, insufficient fund allocated).



                                            46
2. Inadequate project work plan (unsatisfactory baseline data, lack of resource plan
   and financial plan, insufficient preparation of project results framework, lack of
   coordination with other similar programs)
3. Insufficient technical assistance to local stakeholders (lack of training activities
   for consultants, inconsistence policies/mechanisms for project implementation –
   particularly in fund disbursement, inadequate financial plan for consultants’
   supervision and operational costs).
4. Ineffective monitoring and evaluation (inaccurate data in management
   information system, inadequate plans for studies/evaluation).
5. Insufficient coordination with local authorities (multi-interpretation of project
   manual, high turn-over of consultants at local level).
6. Inadequate communication (insufficient communication strategy/plans,
   inadequate financial plan)
7. Delay of budget approval.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

This Annex contains comments on SPADA Aceh-Nias prepared by the Secretariat of the
Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and do not necessarily represent the views
of the MDF’s Steering Committee or donors.

The MDF supports the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in its rehabilitation and
reconstruction of Aceh and Nias following the tsunami and earthquake disasters in Aceh
and Nias in 2004/2005. The MDF, supported by 15 donors, provided grants for the
implementation of 23 post-disaster reconstruction projects in Aceh and Nias. Following
the GoI’s rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, the MDF program prioritized six
outcome areas – recovery of communities, rehabilitation and reconstruction of large
infrastructure, strengthening governance and capacity building, sustaining the
environment, and recovery of livelihoods – in a three-phase approach. The MDF financed
SPADA project contributes to the strengthening governance and capacity outcome area
of the MDF.

This project leveraged the existing Bank-financed Support for Poor and Disadvantaged
Areas (SPADA) Project that covers the country’s poorest and disadvantaged areas at the
district level. The original SPADA project concept was reviewed in May 2002, approved
by the Bank in June 2005, and became effective in December 2005 with seven poorest
districts in Aceh already slated to be part of the program. It was therefore logical and cost
effective to scale up the existing program to cover additional districts in Aceh and Nias as
a response to the GoI’s recovery efforts in Aceh and Nias. At the government’s request,
the MDF agreed to provide grant funds to support the scaling up covering Aceh and Nias.

The MDF supported SPADA in Aceh and Nias benefited from quick project start-up to
deliver urgently needed assistance to disaster-affected area. The project continued the
model adopted by the national SPADA program with an aim to strengthen district
government capacity to incorporate bottom-up (village, sub-district and inter-sub-district)
planning and needs analysis into its planning and budgeting process (Musrenbang) and to
provide block grants to improve public services and the recovery of basic infrastructure
post-disaster. The concept review took place in March 2006 and became effective in May
2007. The project took some time to start up and was extended for an additional 18
months to close in December 2011.

Despite significant early delays, at project closure, a total of 1,738 planned sub-projects
from all sectors – education, health, and infrastructure – were completed, achieving 99%
of the total proposed sub-projects. 100% of the SPADA districts now participate in the
GoI’s participatory planning and budgeting process (Musrenbang) through SPADA’s
capacity development program. More than 9,551 teachers received school management
training; 125 NGO staff and formal justice officials (judges, police, and prosecutors)
were trained to provide judicial services and legal education; through the SPADA
supported Women’s and Legal Empowerment program, more than 2,300 benefited from
legal aid assistance; and through the BRA-KDP project, 233,115 vulnerable women,
IDPs, and ex-combatants were provided with technical assistance and financial support to

                                             48
rebuild their lives. Through disbursement of block grants, SPADA supported the
construction and rehabilitation of 97km of roads, 23 units of irrigation systems, 125
schools, and 29 village health clinics. In sum, the SPADA project in Aceh and Nias has
contributed to the government’s efforts to develop rural poor and disadvantaged areas to
create economic development opportunities and to provide improved services for its
citizens, particularly in health, education, and community infrastructure, contributing to
an important outcome area in the MDF portfolio.

Despite the embedded difficulties, the project was agile in working outside the box by
leveraging an existing program, the USAID funded LGSP, to provide needed capacity
building activities to local governments as well as partnering with TAF to improve
investment climate in the affected region.

Due to budget delays and other problems in the earlier years of implementation, some
block grant funds could not be distributed resulting in savings of US$4.2 million. These
unspent residual funds were returned to the MDF pool six months before project closing
date through a restructuring of the project and cancellation of funds. The funds thus
released were subsequently reprogrammed to other ongoing projects. This flexible
approach by the project team allowed the MDF to optimize the use of the funds for the
reconstruction of Aceh and Nias, within the tight timeline for the overall MDF program
to address unmet needs. This approach is particularly significant for projects that are
funded from programs with a finite implementation period and funds that are usable for
very specific purposes, so that time and funds are most efficiently utilized across a wider
portfolio.

The ICR identifies areas that contributed to the implementation delays, ranging from
consistent lateness in the annual DIPA issuance and protracted procurement processes on
the government side, to the revolving TTL from the Bank side, resulting in less than
satisfactory performance during the first half of the program. The ICR further cites that
the project recognized at the outset that the lack of experience and capacity of the newly
established implementing agency, MinDA, would be a significant risk factor to mitigate.
However, while the project could have partnered with a more experienced ministry for
the implementation of SPADA for Aceh and Nias to ensure, for example, more efficient
procurement execution, the challenges of delays in the annual DIPA issuance is
entrenched in the Indonesia planning process. As one of the lessons learned, in post
disaster settings where speed of implementation is important, risk factors in the
implementation arrangements, such as working with a newly-established ministry, should
be carefully considered and risk mitigation measures fully defined. Furthermore, projects
operating in post-disaster situations should take full advantage of the Bank’s streamlined
procurement procedures.

The project built in a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program at the onset, but
unfortunately very little of it was implemented due to, as stated in the ICR, lack of
qualified personnel, procurement delays, and DIPA delays. Had the M&E system been
implemented as designed, with quantitative and qualitative management information
system (MIS) augmented by surveys and case studies to track results due to project

                                            49
interventions. The deficiency of the MIS adversely affected the availability of data for the
project to report on. These data would have greatly enhanced the project to report on
results. Impact of the numerous capacity building activities, an important MDF outcome
area, were never well captured in the project’s reporting.
