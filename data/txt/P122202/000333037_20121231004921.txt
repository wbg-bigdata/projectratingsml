F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The program development objective (PDO) of the series of three programmatic development
policy operations (DPOs) was to support the Government of Georgia’s policy reform program to
(i) mitigate the impact of the economic downturn in the short-term; and (ii) facilitate recovery and
prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium-term. In addition to a satisfactory
macroeconomic and fiscal framework, the main policy areas supported were: (i) improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the social
safety net; and (iii) improving external competitiveness.

The reforms backed by the DPO series were successful in supporting economic recovery in
Georgia after sharp economic crisis during 2008-2009. Economic growth rebounded to 6.3
                                                viii
percent in 2010 and 7 percent in 2011 from 3.8 percent contraction in 2009. The macroeconomic
and fiscal framework included a countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate the downturn during
2008-09, followed by quality fiscal adjustment to safeguard sustainability as economic recovery
took hold during 2010-11. The overall fiscal deficit declined from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to
6.6 percent in 2010 and 3.6 percent in 2011.

Reforms to improve efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures facilitated fiscal
adjustment and created the conditions to sustain recovery and post-crisis growth in the medium
term. Public expenditure efficiency benefited from the enactment of a new Budget Code,
enhanced results orientation of the budget, and strengthened capital budgeting. The new Budget
Code helped to anchor budget planning and management in a unified legal framework for
budgeting at all levels. A greater share of public expenditures was covered by improved
performance indicators, thus helping to better align expenditures with national priorities and
allocate resources according to monitorable results and outcomes. A multi-annual public
investment program (PIP) was incorporated as an annex to the annual budget, thus helping to
strengthen the transparency and accountability of public investment programming.

Reforms to improve effectiveness of the social safety net helped cushion the impact of the
downturn and ensure that the benefits of post-crisis growth were more broadly shared. Coverage
was scaled up and benefits were improved while reinforcing targeting effectiveness. The shares
of the poor and extreme poor receiving publicly subsidized health care and targeted social
assistance increased markedly. The number of people receiving targeted social assistance
increased to around 440,000 people in 2011 from 370,000 people at the end of 2008, and the
amount of the benefit for additional family members was raised. Similarly, the number of people
receiving targeted medical insurance increased to roughly 900,000 people in 2011 from 750,000
people at the end of 2008, and an outpatient drug benefit was added to the insurance package.

Reforms to improve external competitiveness ensured that a vibrant and competitive private
sector contributed to economic recovery and served as an engine of post-crisis growth in the
medium term. Tax, customs, and trade-related reforms helped strengthen competitiveness and
bolster investor confidence. The share of electronic tax filings increased markedly (from 1
percent in January 2009 to more than 85 percent by end-2010), reducing tax compliance costs for
businesses. Improved risk management helped lower the costs of customs clearance and trading
across borders, with the share of customs declarations subject to physical inspection (red corridor)
down from 13 percent in January 2009 to 5 percent in January 2011. As a result of progress in
identifying and implementing select trade-related reforms to improve access of Georgian products
to international markets, the European Union (EU) decided to begin Deep and Comprehensive
Free Trade Area (DCFTA) negotiations with Georgia in early 2012.

indicators utilized during the course of the DPO series. This includes baselines and values of

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

From 2004 through mid-2008, Georgia implemented significant economic reforms which,
together with a favorable global environment, resulted in strong growth and
macroeconomic stability. Reforms were undertaken to strengthen public finances, improve the
business environment, upgrade infrastructure services, and improve social services. As a result,
economic growth averaged in excess of 9 percent per year during 2004 through mid-2008. A key
driver of this growth was substantial inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which increased
from $331 million (8.3 percent of GDP) in 2003 to $1.67 billion (16.4 percent of GDP) in 2007.
This was made possible by improvements to the business environment, with Georgia’s Doing
Business rank improving from 112th place in 2005 to 15th place in 2008. Far-reaching trade
liberalization also made Georgia one of the most open trading regimes in the world. Furthermore,
tax reform and effective anti-corruption measures resulted in an increase in tax revenues from
14.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 25.8 percent in 2007, thus allowing an increase in social and
infrastructure investment expenditures. Public debt burden indicators improved steadily, with
external public debt declining from 46 percent of GDP in 2003 to 17.5 percent of GDP in 2007.

The government’s reform agenda during this period was supported by the Bank through
the Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) series. In addition to restoring a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework, the PRSO series supported reforms in the areas of
strengthening the public sector, improving electricity and gas sector services, improving the
environment for private sector development, and improving social protection, education, and
health sector services. The PRSO series was a cornerstone of the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy covering 2006-09, which focused on three key areas: (i) enabling income- and
employment-generating growth; (ii) human development and social protection; and (iii)
improving efficiency in public services.

In 2008-09, Georgia was hit with the dual shocks of the August 2008 conflict and the global
financial crisis, which resulted in a sharp downturn in economic growth and rising
unemployment and poverty. The double shocks led to a sharp drop in investor and consumer
confidence, contraction in foreign direct investment, exports, and remittances, and a cutback in
bank lending. The impact of these shocks included a significant decline in investment and
economic growth, stress on public finances from revenue shortfalls and increased expenditure
needs, and stress on balance of payments from a collapse in FDI and other private capital inflows.
The economy contracted by 6.5 percent during the second half of 2008 and by 3.8 percent in
2009. FDI inflows collapsed from 16.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 6.1 percent in 2009, while
exports fell from 31 percent of GDP in 2007 to 29.8 percent in 2009. Georgia found itself with
thousands of new internally displaced persons (IDPs) and the livelihood of thousands more was
threatened by the loss of jobs and income. Unemployment spiked upward from 13.3 percent in
2007 to 16.5 percent in 2008 and 16.9 percent in 2009. The incidence of poverty rose from 17.7
percent in 2008 to 21 percent by 2010.

The authorities responded swiftly with a policy mix directed at mitigating the impact of the
economic downturn, restoring investor confidence and economic growth, and maintaining
macroeconomic stability. In particular, the authorities relaxed the fiscal stance to implement a
countercyclical response to the shocks, provided immediate liquidity and regulatory support to
the banking sector, and worked with the international community to secure donor support. Public
                                                1
expenditures were scaled up and reallocated toward social needs and infrastructure investments.
The authorities also recognized that progress on the unfinished policy reform agenda from the
pre-crisis period would be important in restoring and sustaining growth and making progress
toward poverty alleviation, and thus decided to implement an aggressive and comprehensive
reform agenda.

The Government’s response to the crisis received broad support from the international
community. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) Standby Arrangement (SBA) for $750
million was approved in September 2008 and subsequently supplemented with $400 million and
extended through June 2011. Also in September 2008, the World Bank Board approved an
exceptional $40 million IDA credit for budget support as a Supplement to the Fourth Poverty
Reduction Support Operation (PRSO). In October 2008, following a Joint Needs Assessment led
by the World Bank and the United Nations (with the collaboration of ADB, EC, EBRD, EIB, and
IFC) and an International Donor Conference in Brussels, Georgia received financial pledges from
the international community of $4.5 billion over three years, including $850 million for the
banking sector. This included a mix of immediate and medium-term assistance for both budget
support and investment needs. The list of donors included the World Bank, the European
Commission (EC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), US Treasury, Japan, the Netherlands,
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), USAID, UNDP, the Millennium
Challenge Corporation, and other bilateral donors.

The Bank provided two lines of credit on an urgent basis in the immediate aftermath of the
August 2008 conflict and followed up by beginning preparation of a new DPO series in
response to the government’s request. First, the Supplementary Credit of $40 million approved
in September 2008 provided urgent budget support to sustain implementation of the PRSO
program in the face of unanticipated budget constraints. Second, a $40 million credit for the
Municipal Development Fund (MDF) was also approved on an expedited basis in October 2008
to support emergency rehabilitation works in conflict affected areas, as well as housing and
livelihood support for internally displaced persons (IDPs). In January 2009, in response to a
request from the authorities, the Bank began preparation of a new DPO series to support the
government’s reform agenda.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO), Policy Areas, and Key Indicators

The program development objective (PDO) of the DPO series was to support the
government’s policy reform agenda to (i) mitigate the impact of the economic downturn in
the short-term; and (ii) facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth in the
medium-term. In addition to a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework, the main
policy areas supported were: (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii)
improving the effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external competitiveness.
The First DPO (approved in July 2009) balanced support for immediate crisis mitigating
measures with structural reforms. The Second DPO (approved in July 2010) facilitated an
orderly transition in the focus of reforms from immediate crisis mitigating measures toward
preparing the conditions for post-crisis growth. The Third DPO (approved in July 2011) shifted
emphasis toward measures directed at sustaining economic recovery and preparing Georgia for
post-crisis growth in the medium term.

The DPO series was anchored in a strong Government program to respond to the crisis in
the short term and implement key structural reforms in the medium term. The
                                                 2
Government’s reform program was described in its annual strategy document titled Basic Data
and Directions (BDD). The main directions of the medium term strategy were based on the
“United Georgia without Poverty? strategy document, approved in January 2008 and thus
predating the significant changes to the economic environment following the August 2008
conflict and the global economic crisis. While this strategy provided the main directions of the
Government’s reform program, the pace and emphasis of reforms necessarily adjusted to reflect
the impact of the double shocks to the economy and the subsequent policy response. These
refinements to pace and emphasis were reflected in the annual BDD documents.

The DPO series was the central component supporting structural reforms in the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Georgia covering FY 2010-13. The CPS is built on the twin
pillars of meeting post-conflict vulnerability needs and strengthening competitiveness for post-
crisis growth. These overarching objectives in the CPS reflect the objectives of the
Government’s reform program in the aftermath of the twin crisis. The CPS Progress Report
discussed by the Board in April 2011 rebalanced emphasis toward the intersection of the two
pillars. The DPO covered the core sectors targeted for Bank Group support, and the reforms
supported by the DPO program were complemented by technical assistance and investments in
essential infrastructure and service delivery, public sector financial management, health, and
energy.

The reforms supported by the DPO series were directed at achieving key objectives in
maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework and in three thematic
pillars. They key indicators used to assess program outcomes, including baselines and progress
at each stage, are presented in the table of outcomes and monitorable indicators (table 3 in section
3 of this document). The policy actions implemented in each area are presented section 2.1.

The key objectives of the macroeconomic and fiscal framework included a countercyclical
fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis followed by significant fiscal
adjustment to safeguard sustainability as investor confidence and economic growth recovered. A
set of key indicators were monitored particularly closely during the course of the DPO series.
These included: (i) economic growth, with the objective of mitigating the depth of the downturn
in 2009, followed by recovery and growth in 2010-11; (ii) maintaining low to moderate inflation;
(iii) the fiscal deficit, in line with the objectives of the macro-fiscal framework; (iv) a sustainable
level of external public debt; and (v) a flexible exchange rate consistent with external
sustainability. The macroeconomic policy framework was supported by the IMF SBA program
during 2008-11.

Pillar 1 – Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Public Finances

The DPO series supported a set of reforms directed at improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of public expenditures in general and capital expenditures in particular. Public
expenditures had increased considerably during 2004-07, supported by higher revenues, so that an
important priority during the course of the DPO series was to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of expenditures. This aimed to serve several purposes, including ensuring that
public expenditures contributed effectively to Georgia’s growth and poverty reduction priorities;
facilitating fiscal adjustment and ensure that it took place in a manner that protected important
social and infrastructure expenditures deemed essential for sustainable growth; enabling
adjustment in public expenditures to reinstate private investment as the engine of growth in the
post-crisis period. The reforms supported under this pillar were in three areas, with key
indicators used to monitor progress in each area.
                                                  3
The first area was an improved public financial management framework, which sought to
improve the strategic, regulatory, and methodological framework to coordinate progress in the
different areas of public financial management. This included: (i) development of a strategy on
public finances, the Public Financial Management Reform Policy Vision 2009-2013, to provide a
framework for the coordination of reforms; and (ii) enactment of a new Budget Code to unify the
legal framework for budgeting at all levels.

The second area was the development of results-oriented budgeting through a multi-year,
stepwise process in order to connect resources to measurable development results. Over the
course of the DPO series, the reform measures in this area began with piloting results oriented
budgets including performance indicators for one program in three ministries for the 2009 budget
year; and ended with submission to parliament of results oriented budgets with a new
program/subprogram structure and a corresponding hierarchy of performance indicators for five
ministries for the 2011 budget and reporting on actual performance. The key indicators
monitored in this area included the number of spending units and programs covered by results-
oriented budgets, as well as the quality of performance indicators and reporting on actual
performance.

The third area was improved efficiency and effectiveness of public investment through the
stepwise development of a multi-year public investment program in which project priorities and
multi-year funding requirements are elaborated in a single document. Over the course of the
DPO series, the reform measures in this area began with piloting preparation of the public
investment program for two spending units for the 2009 budget year; and ended with submission
to parliament of a public investment program including the complete time profile of project
financial information, summary project justifications, and physical monitoring indicators
covering a majority of public investment for the 2011 budget and reporting on actual versus
planned project implementation. The key indicators monitored in this area included the
transparency and accountability of public investment programming, as well as the quality of
procedures and guidelines for preparing public investment projects.

Pillar 2 – Improving the Effectiveness of the Social Safety Net

The DPO series supported a set of reforms to improve the effectiveness of the social safety
net to protect the vulnerable and to ensure that the benefits of sustained growth in the medium
term are broadly shared. Georgia had already taken steps toward developing a social safety net
by putting in place the targeted social assistance (TSA) program and the medical insurance
program (MIP) for the poor. However, needs remained to improve social assistance coverage of
the poor, improve access to health care particularly for the poor, and to enhance financial
protection against impoverishing out-of-pocket health payments. Moreover, the economic
downturn of 2008-09 also led to the need for improved social safety net benefits. The needs for
improvements in the social safety net were addressed through reforms under this pillar in two
areas, with key indicators used to monitor progress in each area.

The first area was continued improvement in effectiveness of social transfers, including
particularly the TSA program. The amount of the TSA benefit and overall coverage were
increased under DPO-1 to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn. Over the course of the
DPO series, a range of measures were implemented to improve targeting effectiveness of TSA so
as to increase coverage of the poor for given levels of overall coverage. These measures included
preparing a monitoring report, adjusting the proxy-means testing formula, improving business
processes, linking the Social Services Agency (SSA) database with that of other government
                                               4
agencies, and recertification of beneficiaries. The key indicators used to monitor progress in this
area included the percent of the bottom quintile and in particular, the bottom decile receiving
TSA (to capture coverage of the poor), the percent of TSA recipients in the bottom quintile and
decile (to capture targeting effectiveness), and the overall number of persons receiving TSA. The
objective over the course of the DPO series was to raise coverage of the poor with no significant
loss in targeting effectiveness.

The second reform area under this pillar was improved access to health care through
fiscally sustainable strengthening of the health care financing system. A two pronged
approach was pursued in this area including expanded coverage and benefits of medical insurance
while improving targeting of the poor and strengthening public stewardship of the health sector.
In the aftermath of the economic downturn, coverage of the MIP was expanded and a publicly co-
financed voluntary health insurance package was introduced to improve access to primary and
urgent hospital care for those not covered by MIP. This was followed by protecting overall
coverage of MIP in the face of fiscal adjustment while improving targeting of the poor. A range
of measures were taken to strengthen public stewardship of the health sector, including:
strengthening oversight of private insurers by establishing a stakeholder forum and financing a
mediation service; introducing an electronic system for beneficiary identification; and
implementing an internationally recognized coding system and data architecture for processing
medical claims. The key indicators used to monitor progress in this area included the share of the
bottom two quintiles with access to publicly subsidized health care, the overall share of the
population with access to insurance, and the accountability and efficiency of the institutional
framework for state-funded health programs.

Pillar 3 – Improving External Competitiveness

The DPO series supported a set of reforms to improve external competitiveness. This was a
key priority in order to restore investor confidence in the aftermath of the economic crisis and to
ensure that a vibrant and competitive private sector served as the engine of post-crisis growth.
Within the broad array of competitiveness enhancing reforms being pursued by the authorities,
the DPO program responded to a request for specific support in four specific areas: (i) reducing
the burden of tax payment and tax compliance on the private sector; (ii) improving customs
administration infrastructure and further streamlining customs procedures to enhance integration
with world markets; (iii) enhancing the export enabling environment by improving access of
Georgian products to European and international markets; and (iv) reform of the statistics system
to provide reliable and timely information to investors and policy makers.

While the business environment had improved impressively in Georgia prior to the DPO
series, the costs of tax compliance and trading across borders lagged other dimensions of
the business environment and affected private sector activity. Georgia had also liberalized its
trade regime considerably by 2007. Furthermore, given Georgia’s geographic position and the
importance of developing export capacity, the authorities considered improvements along both
the tax compliance and customs dimensions to be key priorities.

In the area of reducing tax compliance costs, the reform measures included: (i) introducing
and inducing wider adoption of electronic tax filing to streamline the tax payment system; (ii)
issuing comprehensive standard procedural guidelines for providing the entire menu of taxpayer
services, to replace discretionary procedures; and (iii) introducing and enhancing a risk-based tax
audit system to replace ad hoc tax audits and control checks. The key indicators used to monitor
progress in this area included the time required for tax compliance (both as reported by the Doing
                                                5
Business publication and as estimated by the Revenue Service and Bank team), the share of
electronic tax filings, and the stability of revenue performance, with the objective of no
significant decline in the tax revenue to GDP ratio as tax procedures were streamlined.

In the area of streamlining customs procedures, the reform measures included introducing
and subsequently improving the risk management system at customs. The overall objective of the
reform was to provide different degrees of customs inspections for those with different records of
compliance, thereby progressively reducing the shares of declarations subject to more onerous
documentation and physical inspection requirements. The key indicators used to monitor
progress in this area included the time required to import and export (both as reported by the
Doing Business publication and as estimated by the Revenue Service and Bank team) and the
share of customs declarations subject to the red corridor (requiring physical inspection).

In the area of enhancing the export enabling environment by improving access to European
and international markets, the DPO series supported measures to identify and begin
implementation of reforms in three trade related areas, including food safety, technical barriers to
trade, and competition policy. These measures were also intended to improve Georgia’s
preparedness for initiating negotiations on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement
(DCFTA) with the European Commission. The key indicators of progress included establishing a
framework to create the conditions for improved access of Georgian products to European and
international markets.

In the area of reform of the statistics system, the key objectives included improving the
reliability, timeliness, and independence of statistics, improving technical capacity of staff, and
fostering adoption of internationally recognized statistical methods. In order to achieve these
objectives, the DPO series supported adoption of a concept of reform of the statistics system,
adoption of a new law on official statistics establishing the statistics office as an independent
entity with a supervisory board, and establishment of a monitoring department to ensure more
effective implementation of internationally recognized statistical methods.

1.3 Revised PDO, Policy Areas, and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The original PDO for the DPO series was not revised.

The set of outcome indicators monitored at each stage during the course of the DPO series is
presented in the Matrix of Outcomes/Monitorable Indicators. At the outset of the DPO series,
a set of macroeconomic indicators (growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, and external public debt ratio)
were explicitly included in the matrix of outcomes. These indicators were later left out of the
matrix, although they continued to be monitored. The indicator on Georgia’s paying taxes rank in
Doing Business was also dropped from the matrix due to its relative nature (depending on the
performance of other countries), although this indicator continued to be monitored. Similarly, a
number of indicators that were monitored over the course of the DPO series but were not
explicitly listed in the matrix at the outset were later incorporated into the matrix.

The original policy areas were not revised, with no substantial changes to the overall reform
program supported by the DPO series. The formulations of a number of prior actions for
DPO-2 and DPO-3 were refined to provide greater specificity to the actions being implemented.
Details on the refinements were provided in the documents for DPO-2 and DPO-3. Beyond these
refinements, two prior actions were dropped and one prior action was modified to enhance the
selectivity of the program and emphasize actions that were most important to the overall success
                                                 6
of the reform program. First, the prior action on a new program and capital budgeting
methodology was dropped from DPO-3, with approval ultimately taking place in September
2011. Second, the prior action on the social safety net strategy was dropped, with the authorities
providing a summary of their strategy for social and health programs in the Letter of
Development Policy. Third, the prior action on health coverage in DPO-3 was modified to focus
on the targeted MIP which provides the overwhelming bulk of coverage and financial protection
against health payments for the poor in Georgia, with the smaller voluntary 5-Lari program
phased out because of limited uptake.

1.4 Other significant changes

There were no significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, or funding allocations.

Schedule: The DPO series consisted of three operations and spanned three years, as originally
intended. Each operation was approved and disbursed in line with the originally envisioned
schedule.

Funding: Disbursements respected the target of $175 million in IDA and IBRD funds, and €4.493
million (US$6.2 million equivalent) in co-financing Trust Fund grants extended by the
Government of the Netherlands; the original amounts under each operation were disbursed as
scheduled.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

The reforms backed by the DPO series were successful in mitigating the impact of the
economic downturn in 2009 and facilitating recovery and supporting post-crisis growth in
2010-11. The authorities implemented an effective countercyclical fiscal stimulus to restore
investor confidence and support economic recovery. The economy contracted by 3.8 percent in
2009 (less than in many other countries of the ECA region) and economic growth rebounded to
6.3 percent in 2010 and 7 percent in 2011. Quality fiscal adjustment was implemented in 2010-
11 to safeguard sustainability, with the overall fiscal deficit declining from 9.2 percent of GDP in
2009 to 3.6 percent in 2011. External public debt rose from 21 percent of GDP in 2008 to a peak
of 33.6 percent in 2010, but remained well below prudential thresholds as fiscal adjustment took
hold and much of the borrowing to finance the stimulus was on concessional terms. Significant
external adjustment took place in the post-crisis period, with the current account deficit declining
from 22 percent of GDP in 2008 to 10.3 percent in 2010 as the exchange rate remained flexible in
the face of lower FDI and other private capital inflows.

Significant progress was achieved across the policy reform agenda supported by the DPO
series under the three thematic pillars:

•   The efficiency and effectiveness of public finances was significantly improved through the
    enactment of a new Budget Code, the stepwise improvements in the results orientation of the
    budget, and the stepwise development and improvement of the multi-year public investment
    program. The new Budget Code helped to anchor budget planning and management in a

                                                 7
       unified legal framework for budgeting at all levels. A greater share of public expenditures
       was covered by improved performance indicators, thus helping to better align expenditures
       with national priorities and allocate resources according to monitorable results and outcomes.
       The multi-annual public investment program (PIP) was incorporated as an annex to the
       annual budget, thus helping to strengthen the transparency and accountability of public
       investment programming.

   •   The effectiveness of the social safety net was improved considerably, thus helping to cushion
       the impact of the downturn and ensure that the benefits of post-crisis growth were more
       broadly shared. Coverage was scaled up and benefits were improved while reinforcing
       targeting effectiveness. The shares of the poor and extreme poor receiving publicly
       subsidized health care and targeted social assistance increased markedly. The number of
       people receiving targeted social assistance increased to around 440,000 people in 2011 from
       370,000 people at the end of 2008, and the amount of the benefit for additional family
       members was raised. Similarly, the number of people receiving targeted medical insurance
       increased to roughly 900,000 people in 2011 from 750,000 people at the end of 2008, and an
       outpatient drug benefit was added to the insurance package.

   •   External competitiveness was bolstered, with tax, customs, and trade-related reforms helping
       to restore investor confidence and ensure that a vibrant and competitive tradable private
       sector served as the engine of post-crisis growth. The share of electronic tax filings increased
       markedly (from 1 percent in January 2009 to more than 85 percent by end-2010), reducing
       tax compliance costs for businesses. Improved risk management helped lower the costs of
       customs clearance and trading across borders, with the share of customs declarations subject
       to physical inspection (red corridor) down from 13 percent in January 2009 to 5 percent in
       January 2011. As a result of progress in identifying and implementing select trade-related
       reforms to improve access of Georgian products to international markets, the European Union
       (EU) decided to begin Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) negotiations with
       Georgia in early 2012.

   The implementation of the individual operations of the DPO series proceeded according to
   schedule. Implementation of the reform triggers of the DPO series (see Table 1) was achieved
   according to or ahead of plan in most cases during the program. As will be elaborated in Section
   3, several areas of the program (such as TSA and MIP coverage of the poor, the share of
   electronic tax filings, and the share of customs declarations subject to physical and documentation
   inspections) over-performed original targets. As is customary during the course of a
   programmatic DPO series, the formulations of a number of prior actions for DPO-2 and DPO-3
   were refined to provide greater specificity to the actions being implemented.

   2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

   A number of factors contributed to the success and pace in implementation of the policy reforms
   supported by the DPO program. These included:

   The Government’s strong ownership of the reform program: The government had strong
   ownership of the reform program supported by the DPO series and led both the design and
   implementation of the reforms, with the Bank playing a supportive and catalytic role. The
   Georgian authorities had a clear vision about its macro-fiscal and structural reform priorities in
   the aftermath of the economic crisis and these priorities were reflected in the program
   development objectives, policy areas, and outcomes supported by the DPO series. Both the
   reform vision and ownership of the reform program transcended individuals and remained intact
   even through changes in Prime Minister and other key Ministers.

   Mutually reinforcing macro-fiscal framework and structural reform priorities: The
   priorities of the macro-fiscal framework were to restore investor confidence and economic growth
   through an effective countercyclical fiscal stimulus in 2008-09 followed by quality fiscal
   adjustment to safeguard sustainability during 2010-11. The reforms under the public finances
   pillar supported the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus and subsequently facilitated fiscal
   consolidation. The social safety net reforms scaled up coverage and benefits during the fiscal
   stimulus and focused more on enhancing targeting effectiveness during the subsequent fiscal
   consolidation. The external competitiveness reforms sought to restore investor confidence and
   support the tradable private sector as the engine of post-crisis growth. The mutually supportive

                                                        11
and closely intertwined macro-fiscal framework and policy reforms contributed to success
implementation of the program.

Focused and outcome-oriented program design: The DPO series focused on priority issues
where the immediate and medium-term strategy was well-understood by the government and
where the Bank had a comparative advantage in supporting the reforms. Furthermore, the
reforms were focused sharply on outcomes indicators that were important priorities for the
government. As such, the DPO program utilized an extensive results framework, with baselines
and targets for monitorable outcome indicators at each stage of the programmatic series put
together with direct government input. This led to a keen focus of the authorities on achieving
the outcomes being supported by the program and allowed for some flexibility in refining the
formulation of the reform actions that would lead to achievement of those outcomes.

Strong donor support and coordination: Georgia received strong support from the
international community in the aftermath of the August 2008 conflict, which contributed to the
success of its post-crisis response. Effective coordination among development partners, including
the EC, the Netherlands Government, USAID, IMF, ADB, UNDP, DFID, SIDA, and the World
Bank, among others, was important to successful implementation of the Government’s reform
program. The design and implementation of the DPO program was closely coordinated with
other development partners, with a view to preventing duplication and enhancing synergies. The
Netherlands Government provided co-financing for DPO-1 and DPO-2. Coordination with the
IMF was facilitated by the annual Joint Management Action Plan (JMAP).

Technical assistance and analytical work: Design and implementation of the DPO-backed
reforms was supported by a well-coordinated body of analytical work and technical assistance.
The Bank’s Programmatic Public Expenditure Review and Poverty Assessment supported reforms
in the area of public finances and the social safety net. Public Sector Financial Management
Reform Support project (funded by IDA jointly with DFID, SIDA and the Government of
Netherlands) and the Bank financed Health Sector Development projects supported
implementation of the DPO reforms. The reforms to the statistics system were supported by a
trust fund on statistical capacity building. The donor community provided key technical
assistance, including US Treasury and EC on results-based budgeting and capital budgeting, the
IFC on reforms to streamline tax compliance, and the EC on trade-related reforms.

Lessons from prior Bank operations: The history of dialogue between the Government and the
Bank on previous operations facilitated successful design and successful implementation of the
DPO program. The DPO series followed successful completion of the PRSO series which
supported structural reforms in Georgia during 2005-08. The formulation of the DPO program
drew on lessons learned during the course of the PRSO program, as all as previous development
policy operations.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Ministry of Finance served as the main coordinator for managing the overall implementation
of the DPO program. The primary implementing line agencies included the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable
Development in coordination with the Prime Minister’s office. The monitoring of the DPO series
was carried out through periodic preparation and supervision reviews of the different operations.
Progress in the implementation of policy measures and achievement of outcomes was also
supported by other Bank financed projects, including specifically the Public Sector Financial
                                               12
Management Reform Support and Health Sector Development projects. The macroeconomic and
fiscal framework was closely monitored in coordination with the IMF.

Overall, the outcome indicators were appropriate for the purpose of monitoring progress in the
achievement of key development objectives supported by the DPO program. Some of the
outcome indicators were process oriented (particularly in the first pillar), but most were
quantitative in nature. Each pillar had several outcome indicators, with the program being
selective in focusing on the outcome indicators of greatest importance to the authorities. The
selection of outcome indicators was undertaken with strong government participation and
ownership.

Periodic monitoring and evaluation of the DPO program informed decision making and fed back
into program management in a number of key areas, including refining formulation of reform
triggers and targets for outcome indicators at each stage. The M&E of the DPO also contributed
to the results-based budgeting reform and hence to increased transparency and accountability of
the government’s overall reform program.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

Given the strong record of the DPO program and the need to continue to address Georgia’s
medium term development priorities, the government requested and the Bank agreed to move
forward with the follow-up Competitiveness and Growth (CG) DPO series for 2012-14. The first
operation of the new series was approved by the Board in July 2012. The new series supports the
government’s medium-term reform program for competitiveness and inclusive growth. The CG
DPO retains the pillars of the past DPO program, i.e. competitiveness, effectiveness of public
financial management, and effectiveness of social spending. The objectives of these pillars have
deepened to include support for reforms in energy, education, financial reporting and medical
insurance and social assistance transactions costs to beneficiaries, in addition to extending
support for the reform agenda implemented under the DPO program of 2009-11.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The reform program supported by the DPO series was highly relevant to the dual
challenges faced by Georgia in the aftermath of the August 2008 conflict and the global
financial crisis. The double shocks to the economy led to a sharp drop in investor and consumer
confidence, contraction in FDI, exports, and remittances, and a cutback in bank lending. The
economy contracted by 6.5 percent in the second half of 2008 and Georgia found itself with
thousands of new IDPs and thousands more threatened by the loss of jobs and income. The
authorities found themselves with the dual challenge of mitigating the impact of the economic
downturn and supporting economic recovery and post-crisis growth. The reform program
supported by the DPO series was focused sharply on addressing these dual development
objectives.

The macro-fiscal framework supported a countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate crisis
impact and restore investor confidence, followed by fiscal adjustment to safeguard
sustainability. Under the fiscal stimulus, social benefit expenditures were scaled up to support
those affected by rising unemployment and public investment was scaled up in IDP housing,

                                              13
roads, and municipal infrastructure to stimulate economic recovery and post-crisis growth. As
investor confidence and growth rebounded in 2010-11, fiscal adjustment was implemented in a
way that protected critical social and infrastructure expenditures to help sustain recovery and
growth.

The reforms in the area of public finances served to better align Georgia’s public
expenditures and investments with its growth and development priorities. With public
expenditures increasing considerably during 2004-07, improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of expenditures was an important priority for both the short-term and the medium-term during the
DPO period. The reforms in this area served to enhance the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus
expenditures and subsequently facilitated quality fiscal adjustment by consolidating less critical
expenditures.

The reforms in the area of the social safety net served to cushion the impact of the crisis on
the affected population and ensured that the benefits of post-crisis growth were more
broadly shared. Coverage and benefits of the targeted social assistance and medical insurance
programs were raised in the aftermath of the crisis, followed by a range of measures to improve
targeting effectiveness of both programs while protecting coverage and benefits as fiscal
adjustment was implemented. These measures led to considerable increases in coverage of the
poorest segments of the population throughout the course of the DPO series.

The reforms in the area of external competitiveness served to restore investor confidence
and re-establish a vibrant private sector as the engine of growth in the post-crisis period.
Although Georgia’s business environment had improved considerably prior to the DPO series, the
costs of tax compliance and trading across borders lagged behind. The tax and customs reforms
were directed at addressing these impediments to private sector activity. Furthermore, with the
trade regime already liberalized considerably by 2007 but Georgia’s exports to larger markets
impeded by relations with Russia, trade-related reforms were intended to create the conditions for
improved access to European and international markets.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework

The economic downturn was contained in 2009 and the economy rebounded strongly in
2010-11. Following the serious shocks from the August 2008 conflict and the global financial
crisis, the economy contracted by a relatively modest 3.8 percent in 2009. This was less than
considerably sharper contractions in several CIS countries in 2009: more than 14 percent in
Armenia and Ukraine, 7.8 percent in Russia, and 6 percent in Moldova. The countercyclical
fiscal stimulus, along with other measures to bolster investor confidence and competitiveness,
were instrumental in containing the economic downturn and stimulating economic recovery. The
economy rebounded strongly by 6.3 percent in 2010 and 7 percent in 2011. The rebound
benefited from a pickup in exports, tourism, bank lending, and continued high levels of public
investment. Exports recovered to 36.6 percent of GDP in 2011 from 29.8 percent in 2009. At the
same time, FDI levels remained at about 7 percent of GDP in 2010-11, considerably below pre-
crisis levels, thus suggesting that the drivers of growth had evolved in the post-crisis period, with
a greater role for domestically investment and fortradables.

Effective fiscal stimulus in 2009 was followed by quality fiscal adjustment to safeguard
sustainability in 2010-11. The increase in total expenditures to 38.4 percent of GDP in 2009
                                                 14
from 34 percent in 2007 was also associated with a marked reprioritization of spending.
Expenditures on transport and municipal infrastructure, IDP housing, education, social protection,
and health were scaled up, with fiscal space coming from a marked reduction in defense
spending. The overall fiscal deficit rose from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 9.2 percent in 2009
and was financed in large part by concessional assistance. As growth rebounded, fiscal
adjustment was implemented, with total expenditures declining to 32.1 percent of GDP by 2011.
Defense and general administrative expenditures were consolidated further, while public
investment was maintained at about 9 percent of GDP to sustain recovery and growth. The fiscal
deficit declined to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2011. External public debt rose from 17.5 percent of
GDP in 2007 to a peak of 33.6 percent in 2010, but remained below prudential thresholds and
subsequently declined to 29 percent of GDP in 2011. In April 2011, Georgia received a strong
vote of confidence from international capital markets by refinancing its Eurobond at favorable
terms.

Significant external adjustment took place in the post-crisis period as the exchange rate
remained flexible in the face of lower FDI and other private capital flows. The current
account deficit narrowed from 22 percent of GDP in 2008 to 10.6 percent in 2009, before edging
up slightly to 11.8 percent in 2011. From 2008 to 2011, imports declined by about 3 percentage
points of GDP while exports increased by about 8 percentage points. This external adjustment
was facilitated by the credible fiscal program and a flexible exchange rate. The real exchange
rate depreciated by about 13.2 percent between October 2008 and October 2010. The
macroeconomic framework was supported by an IMF SBA program during 2008-11, with the
ninth and final review completed successfully in June 2011. Inflation remained low at about 2-3
percent (end-of-year) in 2009 in 2011, but spiked upward temporarily in 2010 to 11.2 percent
(end-of-year) due to the spike up in food and energy prices.

Pillar 1: Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Public Finances

Overall, the achievement of the PDO to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public
finances is rated as Satisfactory. Significant improvements were achieved in the areas of the
public financial management framework, the results orientation of the budget, and the public
investment program.

Public Financial Management Framework – Satisfactory

The reform actions taken in this area led to strategic, regulatory, and methodological
improvements to the public financial management (PFM) framework. Under the support of
DPO-1, a strategy on public finances, the Public Financial Management Reform Policy Vision
2009-2013, was developed to coordinate reforms in the different areas of PFM and to provide an
integrated approach to strengthening the public finance system. Under DPO-2, a new Budget
Code was enacted as part of implementation of the PFM Reform Vision. The new Budget Code
represented a considerable achievement as it helped to anchor budget planning and management
in a unified legal framework for budgeting at all levels. It integrated the BDD, results-oriented
budgets, and the public investment program into the annual budget cycle, making each of these a
legal requirement for all spending units by 2012. The Budget Code thus provided an impetus to
the results-oriented and public investment budgeting reforms being supported by the DPO. As
required by the Budget Code, a methodological framework for program budgeting, including
instructions for capital budgeting, was adopted in September 2011.

Improved results-orientation of the budget – Satisfactory

The reforms in this area led over time to a greater share of public expenditures being
covered by results-oriented budgets, with improved performance indicators and reporting
on actual performance. This was achieved through a multi-year, stepwise process. The first
step (DPO-1) involved piloting results-oriented budgets for at least one program in three first-
level spending units. The second step (DPO-2) involved submitting an Information Annex to the
Annual Budget Law for 2010 containing results-oriented budgets of improved quality and
coverage for three ministries. The third step (DPO-3) involved submitting results oriented
budgets for six ministries with a new program/subprogram structure and a corresponding
hierarchy of performance indicators as part of the 2011 Annual Budget, and also reporting on
actual performance. The improvements to the program structure in 2011, as well as the extension
to six ministries versus the target of five, represent over-performance in this area. At the same
time, improving the quality of performance indicators is an ongoing endeavor. Overall, the
reforms in this area helped to better align expenditures with national priorities and allocate
resources according to monitorable results and outcomes. The reforms helped to increase the
focus on outcomes being generated, thus creating embedded incentives to improve efficiency in
the use of resources and delivery of public services. The 2012 Annual Budget extended results-
oriented budgets to all ministries and spending units.

Public Investment Program – Satisfactory

The reforms in this area led to increased transparency and accountability of public
investment programming over a medium term horizon. This was achieved through the

                                               16
stepwise development of a multi-year public investment program (PIP) in which project priorities
and multi-year funding requirements are elaborated in a single document. The first step (DPO-1)
involved piloting preparation of the public investment program for five spending units (exceeding
the targeted of two spending units) for the 2009 budget year. In the second step (DPO-2), the
circular for the 2010 budget was revised to include new forms dedicated to preparing capital
budgets and the Annual Budget Law for 2010 included for the first time, an information annex on
the public investment program for two spending units (the Roads Department and Ministry of
Finance). In the third step (DPO-3), the public investment program information annex to the
2011 annual budget was improved considerably to include the complete time profile of project
financial information, summary project justifications, and physical monitoring indicators
covering a majority of public investment. Furthermore, the two ministries that prepared capital
budgets for 2010 reported on actual versus planned project implementation in 2011.

This PIP provides a tool for use in prioritizing and select projects, assessing appropriate
investment levels, and providing adequate operations and maintenance expenditures. The
reform in this area also took important steps toward progressively strengthening the procedures
for preparing, appraising, selecting, and monitoring capital projects. This was achieved by
improving the guidance on project preparation and reporting issued by the Ministry of Finance, so
as to create incentives for more efficient and effective management of public investment
resources. While important progress was achieved in this area, strengthening the broader capital
budgeting systems in Georgia will require continued attention in the years to come.

Pillar 2: Improving the Effectiveness of the Social Safety Net

Overall, the achievement of the PDO to improve the effectiveness of the social safety net is
rated as Satisfactory. Significant improvements were achieved in expanding coverage of the
poorest parts of the population, scaling up benefits, and reinforcing targeting effectiveness for
both the targeted social assistance and medical insurance programs. Furthermore, public
stewardship of the health sector was strengthened to increase accountability and efficiency of the
institutional framework for state-funded health programs.

Social Transfers, including Targeted Social Assistance – Highly Satisfactory

The targeted social assistance reforms represent a highly successful effort in scaling up
benefits and coverage of the poor without any significant loss of targeting effectiveness.
TSA coverage of the bottom decile of the population increased throughout the course of the DPO
series: from the baseline of 31.6 percent in mid-2007 to 49.3 percent in 2009, 53.9 percent in
2010 and 58.4 percent in 2011. This considerably exceeded the end-program target of 45 percent
of the bottom decile. Coverage of the bottom quintile also followed a similar trend. At the same
time, there was no loss in targeting effectiveness, with the share of TSA recipients in the bottom
quintile maintained at about 65 percent throughout the course of the DPO series. Furthermore,
the amount of the TSA benefit was raised: the base benefit remained at GEL 30 per month but
top-up per family member was doubled from GEL 12 to GEL 24 per month in 2009.

Higher coverage without loss of targeting effectiveness was achieved through an overall
increase in coverage coupled with a range of measures to reinforce targeting effectiveness.
Overall coverage of the TSA program was raised from 370,000 individuals at end-2008 to
440,000 in 2011, with most of the new beneficiaries added by April 2009, during DPO-1.
Furthermore, over the course of the DPO series, a range of measures were implemented to
improve targeting effectiveness of TSA so as to increase coverage of the poor for given levels of
                                               17
overall coverage. These measures included preparing a monitoring report, adjusting the proxy-
means testing formula, improving business processes, linking the Social Services Agency (SSA)
database with that of other government agencies, and recertification of beneficiaries. The budget
allocation for the TSA program increased by about 50 percent in 2009 to fund the higher overall
coverage and benefits, and remained at this level in 2010-11.

Health Care – Satisfactory

The reforms in the area of health resulted in improved access to health insurance for the
overall population in general, and for the vulnerable population in particular. The share of
the bottom two quintiles (vulnerable population) with access to publicly subsidized health
insurance increased from a baseline of 20.7 percent in mid-2007 to 25.8 percent in 2009, 36.9
percent in 2010, and 38.2 percent in 2011. This exceeded the end-program coverage target of 35
percent of the vulnerable. This was achieved in part through an overall increase in MIP coverage
from 750,000 beneficiaries in 2008 to 900,000 in 2009 (financed by a 50 percent increase in the
MIP budgeted in 2009), but also through the range of measures used to reinforce TSA targeting
throughout the DPO series (which also helped focus the MIP program more on the vulnerable).
Access to health insurance for the overall population also increased from a baseline of 12.3
percent in mid-2007 to 30.8 percent by 2011, slightly underperforming the end-program target of
35 percent. Finally, given that pharmaceuticals are a large source of the high out-of-pocket health
payments in Georgia, an outpatient drug benefit was added to the MIP package in 2010.

Measures to strengthen public stewardship of the health sector helped increase
accountability and efficiency of the institutional framework for state-funded health
programs. These measures included strengthening oversight of private insurers by establishing a
stakeholder forum and financing a mediation service; introducing an electronic system for
beneficiary identification; and implementing an internationally recognized coding system and
data architecture for processing medical claims. These measures helped to establish a formal
mechanism to monitor private insurers and also helped to lower high administrative costs often
found in systems with multiple insurers. Furthermore, in 2010, MIP premiums were renegotiated,
generating savings of about 20 percent in the MIP budget in 2011. The publicly co-financed
5-Lari program which provided limited benefits for only about 125,000 beneficiaries in 2010 was
phased out in 2011 due to limited uptake by the population for this voluntary package.

Pillar 3: Improving External Competitiveness

Overall, the achievement of the PDO to improve external competitiveness is rated as
Satisfactory. Significant outcomes were achieved in: (i) streamlining the tax payment system
and reducing costs of tax compliance; (ii) streamlining customs procedures and reducing costs of
trading across borders; (iii) preparing the basis for improved access of Georgian products to
European and international markets; and (iv) increasing reliability and independence of statistics.

Reducing tax compliance burden – Satisfactory

The reforms in this area led to a more streamlined tax payment system and helped to
reduce the tax compliance burden for the private sector. First, the tax payment system was
streamlined by introducing electronic filing of taxes and subsequently inducing wider adoption
through improvements to the IT platform and extensive public outreach. As a result, the share of
electronic tax filings increased from 4 percent in 2009 to 75 percent in 2010 and 92 percent in
2011, far exceeding the original target of about 5-10 percent share of electronic filings by
                                                18
end-2010. Second, in order to improve the quality of taxpayer services and standardize
procedures for service delivery, the Revenue Service issued procedural manuals for use by tax
officers on a wide range of topics ranging from control purchase, VAT, profit reinvestment,
partnerships, liquidation, and tax accounting. The Revenue Service also conducted training
programs for tax officials in the use of the new manuals.

Third, a risk-based tax audit system was introduced and subsequently enhanced to
progressively replace ad hoc tax audits and control checks with risk-based planned on-site
audits. From January 2011, all planned on-site tax audits were selected through the risk-based
system and the share of control checks was reduced to zero, exceeding the target of reducing it to
less than 40 percent. Furthermore, the number of planned on-site audits increased by more than
800% to 890 between July 2010 and April 2011, exceeding the target of a 50 percent increase.
The Revenue Service also issued a procedural manual for tax audits covering 254 scenarios and
continued its efforts to improve the risk-based system with technical assistance from donors. As
a result of reforms to streamline the tax payment system, the time required for tax compliance is
estimated to have fallen by 45 percent from 387 hours per year in 2008 to 210 hours by 2011.

Streamlining Customs Procedures – Satisfactory

The introduction and subsequent improvement of the risk management system at customs
served to streamline customs clearance procedures. The risk management system included
four corridors with different inspection requirements in decreasing order to risk: red (document
and physical inspection), yellow (document inspection), blue (post-clearance inspection of
documents), and green. The DPO supported reforms increased reliance on lower-risk blue and
green corridors through better identification of higher-risk operators. The targets were exceeded.
The share of declarations through the red corridor was reduced from 12-15 percent in June 2009
to 4-5 percent by April 2010. The share through the yellow corridor was reduced from 60 percent
in July 2010 to 20 percent by April 2011. The share through the lower-risk blue corridor was
increased from 8 percent in July 2010 to 30 percent by April 2011, while the share through the
green corridor increased from 28 to 45 percent during this period. These measures helped to
reduce the time needed to import and export (reported by Doing Business) by 17 percent for
exports (from 12 days in 2008 to 10 days in 2011) and 7 percent for imports (from 14 to 13 days).
The time required for customs procedures only is estimated to have declined from 2.5 days in
2010 to 1.5 days in 2011. Customs procedures also benefited from new regulation introduced in
January 2011 which provided for streamlined one stop Customs Clearance Zones (CCZs) and
advance declaration of goods. In addition, in line with the objective of moving away from
documentary and physical checks toward post-clearance examination and audit of documents,
320 post-clearance audits were done between January 2010 and end-March 2011.

Trade-related Reforms – Satisfactory

The reforms in this area established a framework for improved access of Georgian products
to European and international markets. This was achieved by enhancing Georgia’s
preparedness for initiating DCFTA negotiations with the European Commission. Under DPO-2,
Georgia identified and started to implement reforms in trade related areas by submitting strategies
to the European Commission on food safety, technical barriers to trade, and competition policy.
Subsequently, these strategies were agreed with the EC and adopted by the government in 2010,
following which attention shifted to implementation steps in the three trade-related areas. Under
DPO-3, as part of the implementation steps, the Law on Food Safety and Quality was amended to
enable application of food safety controls on all food business operators. Furthermore, a
                                                19
comprehensive draft legislative package (DCFTA package) was prepared covering legislative acts
in the three trade-related areas identified. This legislative package was enacted in June 2012. As
a result of the success of the reforms supported by the DPO series, in January 2012, the EU
decided to begin DCFTA negotiations with Georgia.

Statistics Reforms – Satisfactory

The reforms in this area helped to improve the reliability, timeliness, and independence of
state statistics available to both investors and policy makers. Under DPO-1 and DPO-2, a
concept of reforms of the statistics system was adopted by the government and a new law on state
statistics was enacted establishing the statistics office as an independent entity. In line with this
new law, the new statistics agency, Geostat, was established as an independent entity in February
2010. A key priority for the new statistical agency was the implementation of international best-
practice methods in collecting and compiling statistics. In line with this objective, a monitoring
department was established in January 2011 to ensure more effective implementation of
internationally recognized statistical methods. Furthermore, Geostat pursued its priority of
improving technical capacity of staff through training. The Board of Geostat also approved a
Strategic Master Plan (prepared with the support of the Bank’s Trust Fund on Statistical Capacity
Building) that included a three-year Action Plan.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating for overall achievement of outcomes: Satisfactory

Overall, the achievement of outcomes of the DPO program is rated as satisfactory. The
achievement of outcomes for each of the operations within the DPO series is also rated as
satisfactory. In maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic framework and in achieving the
objectives of each of the three reform pillars, Georgia made substantial and satisfactory progress.
The DPO backed reforms represent a highly successful effort to manage an economy in the
aftermath of serious economic shocks. As detailed in section 3.2, most of the specific DPO
program objectives and outcomes met or surpassed targets. The reforms addressed not only
immediate crisis mitigating needs, but also medium-term challenges to support post-crisis growth
with an effective social safety net.

This strong overall performance could potentially meet the definition of an overall highly
satisfactory rating. However, the program is conservatively being assigned an overall outcome
rating of satisfactory because of the following reasons. First, important medium term challenges
remained in a number of reform areas, including needs to further strengthen broader capital
budgeting systems, reduce high out of pocket health payments, and improve external
competitiveness generally. Georgia more generally faces medium term structural challenges of
reducing unemployment and engineering a shift toward the tradable sectors. Second, for a small
number of specific indicators (overall health insurance coverage and time to trade across borders),
outcomes fell slightly short of targets. Third, the strong record of post-crisis outcomes in Georgia
is not due to the DPO reforms alone, but was complemented by a broader package of reforms and
investments supported by a wide range of development partners.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The economic downturn led to an increase in poverty due in particular to higher
unemployment, as well as high levels of indebtedness. Unemployment increased from 13.3
percent in 2007 to a peak of 16.9 percent in 2009. High levels of household borrowing in the pre-
crisis period also left households particularly vulnerable to higher interest rates and the loss of
income during the crisis. As a result, the overall incidence of poverty rose from 17.7 percent in
2008 to 21 percent by 2010.

The reforms under the social safety net pillar had a direct impact on mitigating poverty
impact. Coverage and benefits of the targeted social assistance and medical insurance programs
were scaled up, with simulations indicating that the targeted programs have a significant impact
in reducing the incidence of poverty. Furthermore, the government also increased pension benefit

                                                       23
from GEL 70 in 2009 to GEL 100 in 2011. While the old age pension is untargeted, it has a
significant poverty mitigating impact. Food and energy vouchers were also distributed in 2011.

Strong growth in 2010-11 led to a decline in unemployment. Reforms to stimulate recovery
and post-crisis growth helped reduce the unemployment rate to 15.1 percent in 2011. Poverty
figures for 2011 are not yet available, but given the strong growth and reduced unemployment, as
well as the robust recovery in agriculture, poverty is likely to have declined as well. The most
recent household survey data covering 2011 will become available in the third quarter of 2012
and will allow an updated analysis.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The reforms supported by the DPO series included significant institutional change and
strengthening in several areas. The enhanced results orientation of the budget, the introduction
of multi-annual public investment programming, the improved targeting of the social safety net,
the strengthening of public stewardship of the health sector, the wide adoption of electronic tax
filing and the streamlining of tax and customs procedures, legislative approximation to facilitate
trade, and independence of statistics all represent significant institutional changes. These
institutional reforms supported by the DPO program shared several strategic directions: increased
efficiency, transparency, and accountability, as well as shift from ad hoc to rule-based systems in
several areas. The general expectation is that these institutional changes will be sustained and
deepened going forward. The gains and public benefit derived from the reforms suggest that they
would be entrenched and difficult to reverse.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Overall Rating: Moderate

       capacity

The risk to development outcome was Significant at the inception of the DPO program.
During DPO-1, economic, political, and social risks were significant. First, the prospects for
economic recovery from the impact of the double shocks of the August 2008 conflict and the
global financial crisis risks were associated with significant uncertainty. The global economic
outlook was highly uncertain, actual disbursement of donor assistance could have fallen short of
pledges, and financial sector vulnerabilities could have deteriorated from a deeper economic
downturn and larger than expected exchange rate depreciation. Second, social and political risks

                                                24
were significant due to higher rates of joblessness and poverty, increased numbers of IDPs, and
elevated domestic and regional tensions.

The overall risk to development outcome declined during the course of DPO-2 and DPO-3,
and is assessed as Moderate. As a result of successful implementation of the post-crisis reform
program and an array of risk mitigation factors, the risks in all critical areas moderated during
2010-11. The overall risk to development outcome is thus assessed as Moderate. The economy
rebounded by more than 6 percent per year during 2010-11, the fiscal deficit declined from 9.2
percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.6 percent by 2011, and inflation declined to low single digits after a
temporary spike upward in 2010 related to higher global food and energy prices. At the same
time, the risks to the economic outlook are not minimal. The global economic outlook remains
uncertain, the current account deficit remains large at more than 10 percent of GDP, and further
fiscal consolidation will require skillful management of significant social and capital expenditure
pressures. These economic risks are mitigated by the authorities’ commitment to fiscal
consolidation and a flexible exchange rate, support from a new IMF SBA/SCF program approved
in April 2012, and the successful refinancing of the Eurobond in April 2011. A new
programmatic Competitiveness and Growth DPO series was approved by the Bank’s Board in
July 2012 to support Georgia’s medium term reform agenda during 2012-14.

Domestic and regional tensions remain at moderate levels but several positive developments
have taken place. Parliamentary elections in October 2012 resulted in a smooth transfer of
power to the new government and while domestic political tensions are not minimal, the new
government and opposition have expressed a commitment to work together constructively.
Presidential elections are scheduled for 2013. The new government is committed to reforms to
address Georgia’s medium-term developmental challenges. Regional tensions remain at
moderate levels, but recent positive developments include the prospect of improved economic ties
following Russia’s accession to the WTO, Georgia’s unilaterally move to waive visa
requirements for Russian citizens, and discussions between a Georgian special envoy and the
Russian deputy foreign minister in Geneva on December 14, 2012.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Quality at entry is assessed as Satisfactory. The Bank responded swiftly to the authorities’
request in January 2009 to support its post-crisis reform agenda. The first operation of the
programmatic DPO series was approved by the Bank Board in July 2009 and disbursed in the
same month in light of Georgia’s significant financing needs at the time. The reform program
supported by the DPO series was embedded in a strong government strategy to respond to
immediate crisis-related needs while also stimulating recovery and post-crisis growth. The DPO
program was also central to the Bank’s new CPS for Georgia for FY 2010-13 built on the twin
pillars of meeting post-conflict vulnerability needs and strengthening competitiveness for post-


                                                25
crisis growth, which also included a number of complementary investment projects and analytical
products.

The DPO program was also selective and focused on those reforms that were most critical and
where the Bank had a comparative advantage in catalyzing reforms. Preparation of the DPO
series was backed by solid analytical and preparatory work, the formulation of prior actions,
triggers, and outcome indicators being led by the Georgian authorities. The Bank also showed
flexibility in refining the program as needed to reflect changing circumstances, such as in phasing
out the publicly co-financed health insurance program which suffered from limited uptake.
Strong government ownership of the reforms at the outset and the well-developed results
framework were key factors responsible for overall success of the DPO program.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank supervision is rated as Satisfactory. There are several aspects of this satisfactory bank
supervision role that bear notice. First, the Bank maintained an active dialogue with the
government on all key areas of the DPO program, and the dialogue was conducted with both the
Ministry of Finance and the line ministries. The coordinated approach followed by Bank staff
contributed to sound supervision and also benefited from supervision activities of complementary
Bank-financed projects. Second, the Bank tailored its supervisory role to the needs of the specific
reform areas. In some areas, such as the public finance reforms, the Bank took on a more
proactive supervisory role in providing advice and feedback in coordination with the Public
Sector Financial Management project. In other areas, Bank supervision did not need to be as
proactive given the proactive management by the government and the complementary role of
other development partners. Third, Bank supervision benefited from a detailed results framework
specified for the DPO program, which was more detailed than is found in many development
policy operations in specifying baselines and targets at each stage of the programmatic operation.
Finally, supervision benefited from strong coordination with other development partners,
including the Government of Netherlands (which co-financed DPO-1 and DPO-2 and often
participated in supervision meetings).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Bank performance is assessed as Satisfactory. Bank performance in ensuring quality
at entry and quality of supervision are both rated as satisfactory. As such, overall Bank
performance is rated as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government’s performance is assessed as Satisfactory due to a number of factors. First,
the authorities responded swiftly to economic crisis and put together a clear policy reform
                                                26
program consisting of both immediate mitigating measures as well as structural reforms to
stimulate recovery and post-crisis growth. The authorities demonstrated strong commitment to
the reform program throughout the course of the DPO series. Second, the government: took the
lead in requesting the Bank’s support and participated effectively and constructively in the design
of the program, taking the lead in the formulation of actions and monitorable outcomes. Third,
the government took the lead in implementing the reform program fully and timely, seeking
technical support where needed, and providing the Bank with accurate and timely reports on
progress. The government maintained its commitment to implementing the reforms through
changes in ministers, with senior officials often responded promptly when major decisions were
needed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of implementing agencies, including the Ministry of Finance and relevant
line ministries, is assessed as Satisfactory. The implementing agencies performed their role
consistently and effectively and often took strong ownership in designing and implementing the
reforms in their respective areas. The implementing agencies were responsive to the Bank’s
requests for information and coordinated well between each other in jointly delivering the DPO
program under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is assessed as Satisfactory. The rating reflects the strong
government ownership of the DPO program by Georgia, the effective leadership of the
Government in designing and implementing it, and demonstrated commitment to safeguarding
and expanding the reforms supported by the DPOs through the new three-year CG-DPO
program..

6. Lessons Learned

The experience of the DPO series provides a number of lessons for the design and
implementation of development policy operation in Georgia and elsewhere.

First, strong Government ownership of the reform program was crucial to the success and
rapid pace of the DPO series. The authorities took the lead in identifying and implementing the
reform program, with the Bank playing a catalytic and supportive role in identifying ways to
enhance what the Government had already decided to implement on an accelerated time schedule.
The DPO program supported key elements of the Government’s post-crisis reform program, as
articulated in annual Basic Data and Directions (BDD) document. The Bank’s analytical work
(including both formal reports but also just-in-time technical advisory support) contributed to the
formulation and implementation of selected aspects of the Government’s reform program.

Second, the strong focus of the Government on outcomes was vital in driving
implementation of the reform agenda. The authorities were sharply focused on achieving
specific development outcomes and the DPO team supported the authorities in developing a
                                                27
detailed set of monitorable outcome indicators to track results from implementation of the reform
program. The focus on results and outcomes not only helped track implementation, but also
helped to more sharply define and formulate the reform triggers necessary for achievement of the
desired results. The set of monitorable indicators went beyond specifying end-program status and
value targets by specifying intermediate target values for each operation. This helped track the
pace of achievement of results along the course of the programmatic series.

Third, the programmatic approach afforded important flexibility to advance and deepen
reform implementation in several areas and reduce the scope of or provide additional time for
implementation in other areas. This approach allowed the program to maintain its relevance to
country circumstances, reinforced government ownership, and contributed to a strong relationship
of trust between the Bank and the Government. The flexibility was particularly appropriate in
light of the Government’s sharp focus on achieving results, which allowed the Bank to be flexible
in supporting the path followed in arriving at the desired results.

Fourth, strong donor coordination to strengthen the Government’s implementation
capacity was essential. The Bank’s projects and other donors provided important technical
assistance to build capacity in key areas. Areas in which Bank projects complemented the
reforms supported by the DPO series included public finances, health, social assistance, and
statistics. The DPO team also coordinated closely with other donors including the EC, the
Netherlands Government, IMF, US Treasury, and ADB, among others. The Netherlands
provided co-financing for the DPO program and often participated in supervision missions.
Increasing the Government’s implementation capacity and leveraging World Bank Group
resources through collaboration with other donors were critical elements in the design of the DPO
series.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Georgian authorities have provided written comments (inserted into Annex 2) to indicate
their agreement with the overall assessment of the ICR regarding achievement of development
objectives, to underline the results of their reform program during the course of the DPO series,
and to emphasize their commitment to continuing implementation of the medium-term structural
reform agenda. Bank staff found these comments fully acceptable and has noted that the
authorities’ reform agenda is being supported through the new Competitiveness and Growth
Development Policy Operation (DPO) series.

(b) Cofinanciers

The Netherlands Embassy has provided written comments (inserted into Annex 3). Collaboration
with the Netherlands along several dimensions was an important ingredient in the success of the
DPO program.
