A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The primary objective of the proposed LIL Project is to test the applicability of a multisectoral
drug prevention strategy in the Argentine context. Drugs and drug-related problems are complex and often
controversial. However, the nature and degree of drug abuse in Argentina do not appear to be as serious as
in other countries. Consequently, the Government's primary interests are: (i) obtaining a more accurate
picture of drug use in Argentina; and (ii) preventing its citizens from becoming drug users.
Successful drug prevention strategies are contingent on the existence and strengthening of social
capital, particularly the enhancement of social skills and assertiveness among young people. In addition,
providing alternatives to drug use, such as opportunities for recognition and personal achievement via
community activities, has been proven to be effective for populations that are most vulnerable to drug use.
Furthermore, international experiences indicate that inclusion of group interaction mechanisms, trained
mental-health professionals, and counselors make a positive impact on potential drug users.
Could such a set of strategies be effective, in the Argentine context? The country already has
significant experience in demand-driven economic and social development through local and community
participation that could be combined with specific drug prevention strategies from other countries to double
the impact of this drug prevention effort. In this context, the LIL mechanism has been selected because of:
* Incomplete information on conditions in the country;
9 A new and relatively unknown area for Bank activities; and
o The need to develop and test the most appropriate intervention package.
The project is expected to help the Government of Argentina (GoA) determine the need and the
framework for a larger drug-prevention project. More specifically, the project would:
* Elaborate the epidemiological profile of drug-addiction and estimate the consumption levels of
psychoactive substances through the development of decentralized information systems;
* Identify and develop technologies for integrated drug-prevention, and transfer them to municipalities
and community organizations;
* Mobilize and strengthen local solidarity networks to prevent primary drug use in local youth; and
* Assist selected municipalities in developing and implementing a municipal plan, which would in turn,
strengthen the capacity of local communities in preventing drug use.
The project would not support supply-reduction activities or drug treatment facilities for secondary
drug users. Nor would it support supply-reduction-related activities including (i) the control of production,
and transportation of illicit drugs; and (ii) investigation and prosecution of drug dealers and users.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex I)
The project would test an operational model and an implementation mechanism for reducing potential
and actual demand for drugs and alcohol. As a LIL, project performance would be assessed based on the
quantity and quality of information generated by the project and the sustainability of the systems and
approaches established. Key performance indicators would include:
* Performance of municipal councils as measured by the number and types of subprojects sponsored;
* Nature and degree of participation by various actors as measured by numbers of participants
-2-



disaggregated by gender, age range, and other relevant indicators;
*  Number, quality, and attendance of courses completed by the youth and municipal councils;
*   Types and quality of data generated;
*   Functionality of the information network;
*  Indications of behavior and attitude changes of at-risk groups as measured by surveys; and
*   Quality of municipal plans and their sustainability implications as measured by post-project budgetary
outlays, as well as average cost per beneficiary by the type of subproject implemented.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: CAS Progress Report No. R-98-266; IFC/R98-233                    Date of
latestCAS discussion: 11/10/98
Social sector assistance has played a lead role in the Country Assistance Strategy for Argentina, both
because of its contribution to poverty reduction, as well as the need to have in place a well-functioning
social safety net to underpin Argentina's Convertibility Plan. Most notably, health, education and social
protection programs, such as the temporary employment creation and public works program (TRABAJAR)
account for the bulk of that support, and have been addressing some of the systemic problems facing the
financing and delivery of quality basic services, particularly for the poor. More recently, as set out in the
latest CAS update, this program of basic services is being complemented with innovative, small scale
learning interventions to support social programs which target particular vulnerable groups and address
specific social problems that Argentina is encountering. This is the case, for example, in the Bank's
ongoing support for AIDS prevention, the proposed support for indigenous peoples, as well as this
proposed program for drug prevention.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The social costs of drug abuse are serious public health concerns in both developed and developing
countries. Whether legal or illegal, a wide range of substances cause harmful effects. The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimates that substance abuse accounts for about 4% of the entire global burden of
disease and injury from all causes, as measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Substance abuse
is the also the major risk factor in road, traffic, and other injuries (8.8%); suicides (2.2%); sexually
transmitted diseases with HIV (1.7%); liver cirrhosis (1.6%); and violence (1%). In countries that are
going through an epidemiological transition, such as Argentina, substance abuse may account for an even
higher proportion of disease and injury burden (about 25%), with alcohol accounting for 10-11% of illness
and death each year. For Latin America alone, significant mortality rates (8.7 per 100,000) of liver
cirrhosis indicate the gravity of the problem.
These figures represent the loss of human capital, as well as the loss of irreplaceable cumulative knowledge
and skills that undermine national productivity. The estimated gross national product lost or not earned,
may amount to 5-6% of country GNP as a result of reduced productivity from drug/alcohol consumption at
work, premature deaths, and medical and social expenses. The costs of providing health care to a drug
addict are thought to be around 80% higher than for an average citizen in the same age group (International
Narcotics Control Board, 1996).
Successful drug prevention efforts depend on the etiology of beginning, continuing, and stopping drug use,
which vary widely among cultures and socio-economic groups. For example, in developed countries, youth
with troubled histories of emotional or physical abuse seem to have different reasons for using drugs than
do youth from stable backgrounds, and reasons for continuing use may be very different from reasons that
-3-



started the use. A teenager may begin drug use because of peer pressure, but continue to use it due to the
addiction developed. It is important to note that different prevention strategies are necessary to apply to
these different patterns affecting drug use, which is why it is imperative to involve local communities in
prevention efforts.
A yet untouched issue in many countries is the deliberate inhalation of volatile solvents, which is an
increasing problem worldwide. These substances, such as glue, petrol, paint thinners, domestic polish and
aerosol sprays are particularly attractive to marginalized and vulnerable young people because of their
ready availability, low cost, and the rapidity of mood alteration following inhalation. Hazards associated
with their use range from sudden death to various neuropsychological and physical harms.
Government Strategy: The GoA is committed to preventing potential substance abuse among the at-risk
population, whether the substance is legal or illegal. This includes the more commonly abused 'hard drugs'
of cocaine, ecstasy, heroine, and crack, as well as alcohol and other legally obtained volatile solvents that
are consumed by the youth in Argentina. The GoA first tackled drug abuse issues formally in 1974 when it
passed a law on drug possession for personal use. The Centro Nacional de Reeducacion Social
(CENARESO) was the first public organization responsible for rehabilitation and treatment of drug users.
During the mid-1981)s, many governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were created to
address the same issues, and provide similar services.
In 1985, the first national organization for drug prevention strategies and policies, the Comision Nacional
para el Control del Narcotrafico y el Abuso de Drogas, was created. Drug prevention activities were
augmented when Argentina became a party to the 1988 U1N Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs & Psychotropic Substances, joining the international community's efforts against drug abuse. In
1989, major anti-narcotics legislation was passed to activate the commitments of community-based
alternatives to prison.
The Comision Nacional was replaced in 1989 by the Secretaria de Programacion para la Prevencion de
la Drogadiccion y la Lucha contra el Narcotrafico (SEDRONAR), which is responsible for coordinating
all counter-narcotics activities, including drug prevention and treatment programs, as well as participation
in international meetings on global anti-drug efforts. Activities have taken place with coordination between
the federal and provincial levels. SEDRONAR's annual budget is approximately $17.5 million (1998).
Drue Use: One of the main challenges is the lack of information on the nature and extent of substance
abuse in Argentina. Through studies conducted to date, it appears that the rate of drug abuse is not
significant (it is estimated that one percent of the population uses drugs), but that without proper attention,
the situation may worsen. In addition, although Argentine-specific data are not available, studies prove
that the abuse of alcohol is a major problem in the Latin America region. Prevalence rates of excessive
drinking in the region, estimated at 15-34%, are high compared with other regions. The incidence rate of
liver cirrhosis is 20.6 per 100,000 people, much higher than in the Middle East (14 per 100,000) and
Sub-Saharan Africa (10.5 per 100,000). Moreover, anecdotal evidence from field visits to the provinces
indicates that excessive alcohol abuse is growing among young girls.
Using information available, it is possible to identify some trends in drug abuse in Argentina. Research in
1996 in the Province of Buenos Aires shows that in two poor neighborhoods, 14% of the population uses
cocaine via inhalation. If youths fifteen years old and above are included in the sample, the rate of cocaine
use rises to 22%. Cocaine is the drug of choice for about 81% of Argentina's drug users, and one study
found that about three percent of students in the Province of Buenos Aires had tried cocaine. Intravenous
(IV) drug use continues to be a problem in Argentina, where the number of registered IV drug users has not
-4-



decreased substantially (900 to 831 cases) from 1994 to 1996. The association between IV drug use and
the spread of HIV/AIDS adds to the urgency.
Although national data are scarce, most experts agree that the group with the highest prevalence of drug
use is young people from 10-30 years old. According to the 1991 census, 25% of the total population is
between 14 and 29 years old, indicating that a significant portion of the population is a high-risk group.
Between 1995 and 1996, the average age of initiating cocaine use dropped from 16 to 14. Prompt and
appropriate action is necessary to ensure that this trend does not continue. Drug users in the 15-20 year
age range often use drugs on an irregular, non-intensive basis; regular or intensive use is evident in the
20-30 age bracket. Since the average age for beginning treatment is 23 years of age, early intervention is
desirable to prevent progression to the stages at which there is more intense use of drugs.
Data also show that there is increased vulnerability for the unemployed and the poor. The unemployment
rate for those between 15 and 19 years of age is three times higher than the national average.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
As a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL), the project's main purpose is to assess the existing situation,
while setting the stage for more comprehensive drug prevention activities in Argentina. Although law
enforcement and treatment programs have traditionally been dominant components of prevention, the
proposed project would see if it would be feasible to promote this community prevention approach as an
alternative to punitive actions. To better determine the drug use situation in Argentina, an information
system would be supported, in conjunction with a municipal focus and a participatory approach. Such
activities, along with institutional strengthening, would provide the necessary background and initiative for
further efforts, and are fully consistent with client demand.
Coordination of Efforts and Capacity Building: A health-focused network for substance abuse exists, which
provides services to addicts. However, coordination is lacking in prevention programs, where levels of
organization differ, strategies are not clearly defined, and responses to the question of prevention are
varied. Prevention activities in Argentina are still in a state of development, working toward improvements
in the technical tools, and analytical and planning strategies used. In line with the GoA's strategy, this
project would bridge that gap.  In addition, the project would strengthen the current capacity of
communities and government by nurturing their collaboration and communication in drug prevention
efforts.
Multisectoral Approach: Drug prevention activities require the input of various sectors, including
education, private sector, social assistance, health, and judicial systems. Therefore, effective programs
require strong coordination between the sectors to address different dimensions of the issue. The project
would use such a multisectoral approach to address the social costs of substance abuse in Argentina.
Local Municipal Focus: The project would use a municipal focus to extend prevention activities, while
ensuring that activities are appropriate for specific situations in municipalities. The information system
would also operate in a decentralized manner, in which information would be collected on a local level and
included in a national network.
Participatory Approach: In order to meet the needs of specific communities, the project would adopt a
participatory approach consistent with the GoA's past successes in community-based economic and social
programs. Such an approach would direct attention to the needs of specific at-risk groups such as the
unemployed, the poor, youths, etc., and tailor programs, such as media campaigns. This participatory
-5-



approach would encourage attention to the "micro" levels at which specific populations would be
supported, including their training and inclusion in drug prevention campaigns.
Information System: As statistical data are currently lacking on both national and local levels, the project
would collect information regarding the current situation, as well as develop a permanent information
system to continue monitoring drug abuse trends. The information generated (national prevalence, factors
associated with drug use, etc., disaggregated by categories such as age, gender, economic status, etc.) is
essential to design improved drug prevention programs.
Young People: Considering the prevalence of drug use among young people, the project would direct
attention to this high-risk group, and sensitize its activities accordingly.  Educational campaigns
encouraging dialogue among young people, and promoting and strengthening youth-related, and youth-led
initiatives would be supported by the project.
HIV/AIDS: Given the association between IV drug use and the spread of HIV/AIDS, the project would
assess and collect more information on the situation, and advance strategies for cooperation with other
programs which are already implementing such initiatives, such as the Bank's AIDS and STD Control
Project (LUSIDA).
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The proposed project has two major components and a small project management component. Further
discussion can be found in Annex 2.
Component A: Participatory Approaches to Drug Prevention (INPA - Intervencion Participativa)
This component is designed to promote local solutions to drug use in selected municipalities on a
pilot basis via: (i) Training local community members and sector professionals; (ii) Training youth leaders;
and (iii) Financing the implementation of the municipal plans for drug prevention. Reflecting the pilot
nature of the project, only five provinces--expected to be Salta, Misiones, Santa Fe, Mendoza, and La
Pampa--would be identified based on demographics, estimated levels of drug consumption, proximity to
known drug trafficking routes and regional representation. Within each province, four municipalities
would be identified, two of which would be selected as the pilot municipalities by SEDRONAR in
accordance with the criteria established in the Operational Manual (OM) of the project. The criteria would
include population (i.e. 10,000 or less), proximity to known drug trafficking routes, estimated levels of
drug consumption, sequestration, commitment of local authorities, presence of NGOs capable of
conducting training and other relevant social indicators.
Component B: Information Systems. Monitoring. and Evaluation (SIME - Sistema de Informacion
Monitoreo y Evaluacion de Adicciones)
This component is designed to establish the network that would facilitate generation and exchange
of information relevant to drug prevention, as well as to carry out the monitoring and evaluation of the
project itself via: (i) a survey-based epidemiological study to obtain information on drug consumption
patterns; (ii) development of prevention methods and training modules that would be disseminated via
-6-



national, regional and provincial workshops; (iii) creation of a network of monitoring centers to strengthen
existing institutions focused on drug prevention; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation of overall project
implementation processes.
Component C: Proiect ManaLyement
A small project implementation unit (PIU), expected to consist of four technical staff, would be responsible
for overall project management.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The proposed project seeks to deepen and extend the existing policy and institutional framework.
In particular, the project would amplify the prevention focus in dealing with drug-related problems, while
the existing policies and strategies are mostly related to the control of drug trafficking. If the project were
to be successful, it could trigger a significant shift in the policies and strategies.
3. Benefits and target population:
The primary benefits of the project would be: (i) the knowledge and experience gained through the
implementation of the project; and (ii) increased institutional capacity of SEDRONAR, municipalities, and
local actors in addressing and handling drug prevention issues. The project targets local community
members, including municipal authorities and local institutions, such as schools, hospitals/clinics and youth
groups. The indirect benefits would be future generations of Argentines potentially free from substance
abuse. Ultimately, if the project is successful, and is replicated, the intended target population would be
high risk groups nation-wide which will cut across all income levels. Nevertheless, for the LIL, the target
population is limited to the five participating provinces which all have per capita incomes below the
national average, and the target populations will more than likely be among the poorer segments of the
population.
-7-



4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project would be managed by a small project implementation unit (PIU), the Subsecretariat for
Prevention and Assistance (Subsecretaria de Prevencion y Asistencia), one of the two subsecretariats
under the Secretariat for the Programming for the Prevention of Drug-Addiction and Fight against Drug
Trafficking (SEDRONAR - Secretaria de Programacion para la Prevencion de la Drogadicci6n y la
Lucha contra el Narcotrcfico; see Chart 2 in Annex 2). The key staff to be hired for the PIU would
include a General Coordinator, an INPA Technical Supervisor, a SIME Technical Supervisor and an
Administrative Supervisor. (see Annex 2; Annex 6).  As described under "C.1. Project Components",
SEDRONAR would work with five provinces, and two municipalities in each province. The municipalities
are required to form a consultative council (Consejo Consultivo Municipal - CCM  to ensure participatory
processes. For further detail, see Institutional framework and flow of funds in Annex 2. Cooperation
between SEDRONAR and the provinces/municipalities would be governed by the Provincial/Municipal
Framework Agreements (Carta de Adhesi6n Provincial/Municipal). The model framework agreements are
included in the Operational Manual.
Financial management arrangements for the project were reviewed by the Bank's financial
management specialist, and found acceptable (see Annex 8: Documents in the Project File).
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The most likely alternative would have been a full-fledged drug-prevention project, larger in size and
broader in geographic coverage and scope. This alternative was rejected because such a project would be:
(i) riskier given lack of information and experience in participatory drug prevention; and (ii) far more
controversial as it would include not only demand reduction measures, but also supply reduction measures,
including regulatory and legislative reforms as well as criminal investigation and prosecution.
As a large part of this project involves the generation and dissemination of drug prevention information, a
public good, it has been determined that the public sector is the best vehicle to target drug prevention
activities. In many cases, treatment and rehabilitation of substance abusers has been successful via the
private sector, but the public nature of prevention activities indicates a strong case for the public sector.
Nonetheless, the private sector, via local NGOs, will be involved in designing the municipal training
programs, as well as the youth training programs.
The decision to focus on primary rather than secondary prevention was made based on the estimates of use
and resource availability. Primary prevention consists of delaying or preventing initial use or stopping the
use of drugs before an individual is actually addicted to the drug. Secondary prevention focuses on early
intervention and treatment referral for those already diagnosed as having a substance abuse disorder.
Argentina already has a strong referral system of drug and alcohol treatment centers, and from an economic
perspective, treatment of dependency disorders is not as cost-effective as prevention.
A broad-based prevention strategy has been selected versus a more targeted approach due to the
multisectoral nature of the drug problem. Since drug use involves several dimensions of community life
from health to education to social capital and religious institutions, it was agreed that each sector should be
included in the preliminary approach.
An approach commonly chosen by the UN and other organizations to reduce drug supply is alternative
development projects which promote the development of specific crops to substitute for coca production
-8-



and offer farmers economic alternatives. This would be a questionable approach, as very little evidence
indicates the 'existence of a significant level of drug production in Argentina. Moreover, the Bank's
experience ha shown that interventions in support of producing single agricultural commodities rarely
succeed. In addition, country experiences demonstrate that even with reduced cultivation of drugs, the
slack is taken up in neighboring countries, where cultivation is unfettered by projects or authorities.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The Bank has little direct experience in drug prevention programs, and the proposed project would
be the Bank's first stand-alone operation. Past support has been primarily of wider social programs,
including social funds, community development projects, community health projects, and others involving
educational programs.
As a result, the experience drawn upon to design the proposed project has been principally that of
the OECD countries. Experience and research on drug-prevention in Europe and the US suggests the
following. First, the complexity of the paths that lead towards drug use and abuse indicate the necessity for
broad-based prevention strategies towards: (i) increasing knowledge about drugs and their effects; (ii)
changing attitudes towards drugs and other deviant behaviors; (iii) decreasing or stopping the use of drugs;
(iv) enhancing refusal, social and life skills; and (v) decreasing negative behaviors. Various studies appear
-9-



to indicate that the enhancement of social skills and assertiveness tends to discourage (or prevent initiation
into) drug use. Provision of alternatives to drug use - providing opportunities for recognition and personal
achievement through involvement in community or 'self-help' activities - is often found to be very effective
for those most vulnerable to drug abuse. Furthermore, inclusion of group interaction mechanisms and
trained mental-health professionals and counselors appear to make a positive impact.
Second, it is essential to include not only illicit drugs but also other substances such as alcohol and
tobacco in any discussion of prevention for the following reasons: (a) the use of any psychoactive substance
enhances the risk of using others (for example, early alcohol and tobacco consumption increases the risk of
illicit drug use); (b) many factors known to be responsible for the onset of drug use (such as family or
peer-group influences) are largely independent of the specific substance used; (c) different substances
appear to have biological similarities (for example, cannabis, opiates and alcohol); (d) it is more efficient
for prevention activities to address all substances, rather than to develop different programs for different
drugs; and (e) if a prevention intervention is to be credible to the young, it must include licit substances
which young people see adults abusing on a daily basis. For these reasons, most primary drug-prevention
programs do not differentiate between substances. Information on specific drugs is clearly necessary, but
providing such information does not play a major role in many preventive activities.
Third, OECD experience also has shown that different age groups appear to benefit from different
strategies. Most effective for children aged 12-14 seem to be strategies that stress interpersonal and refusal
skills, and allow them to have the necessary time to practice using these skills. Also effective would be the
provision of information about the peer/social pressures to use drugs. For older children, successful
programs appear to include more structured, drug-focused sessions. More precisely, successful prevention
programs for children and adolescents appear to:
v   be designed to enhance protective factors and attempt to reverse or reduce known risk factors;
3   target all forms of drug abuse, including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and solvents;
*   include skills to resist drugs when offered, strengthen personal commitments not to use drugs, and
increase social competency (for example, in communication, peer relationships, self-efficacy and
assertiveness);
_   when targeted at adolescents, include interactive methods, such as peer discussion groups, rather
than didactic teaching techniques alone;
*   include a component for parents or care-givers which reinforces what the children are learning and
provides opportunities for family discussion since family-focused prevention has a greater impact
than strategies that focus solely on parents or children;
*   be long term, taking place throughout the school career with repeat interventions to reinforce the
original prevention goals - schools offer opportunities to reach all populations and are also
important settings for specific 'at-risk' groups;
*   strengthen norms against drug use in all drug-abuse prevention settings, including the family,
school and the community - as with family interventions, community programs are more effective
when accompanied by school and family components;
*   be adapted to address the specific nature of the drug-abuse problem in the local community;
*   be more intensive, and begin earlier the higher the level of risk experienced by the target
population; and
*   be age-specific, developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive.
Argentina has successfully implemented a number of participatory community based projects in
recent years (e.g. FOPAR  - Participatory Social Investment Fund; Programa Juvenil;  TITSIDA -
AIDS/STD Prevention Project, etc.). Many of the design features of those projects, including the
-10-



establishment of municipal/provincial council, local action plans and funding of small-scale, demand-driven
community subprojects are incorporated into the proposed project.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The borrower has already made significant progress in the project design and implementation
arrangement, using its own resources. The operational manual has been already drafted and reviewed by
the Bank during the appraisal and the negotiations. In addition, the project has already identified five
provinces for the INPA component. The Bank team's field visits during project preparation confirmed their
strong interest.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has supported a wide range of projects and analytical work in Argentina and the rest of
the world in health, education and social development. Some of them have small components or lines of
actions geared toward drug-prevention. Although this would be the first time the Bank has financed a
comprehensive drug-prevention project, the Bank is strategically situated to transfer useful knowledge and
experience to Argentina. Also the Bank's involvement in the project has already mobilized the support of
the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), and is likely to catalyze the
support of other international organizltions such as the United Nations Drug Control Programme
(UNDCP).
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
O Cost-Benefit Analysis:   NPV=US$ million; ERR= %
* Cost Effectiveness Analysis
O Other
Per LIL procedures, design and execution of detailed economic analysis would be carried out
during project implementation, and will assess the cost-effectiveness of various interventions and their
impacts. While interest in judging the cost-effectiveness of different prevention initiatives has grown, very
few published studies are available - although a number of general guides to economic evaluations do exist
(for example, Tolley, 1992; Gold et al., 1996; Drummond et al., 1997). The costs of prevention activities
fall into four main groups: (i) direct costs to the agency delivering the intervention; (ii) direct costs to other
agencies involved in the intervention; (iii) direct costs to the individuals participating in the intervention;
and (iv) indirect productivity costs. On the other hand, the potential benefits of drug-prevention programs
can also be divided into a number of different categories: (i) health benefits to the individuals targeted by
the intervention; (ii) consumption benefits of the intervention; (iii) other non-health benefits; (iv) social
diffusion effects; and (v) effects on future resource use.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):    NPV=US$ million; FRR= %
Not applicable. This would not be a revenue-generating project.
Fiscal Impact:
Per aforementioned LIL procedures, a detailed fiscal analysis including financial sustainability implications
would be carried out during project implementation.
-11-



3. Technical:
The proposed LIL would assess whether the participatory approach with strong emphasis on municipal and
local levels is a viable option in effective drug prevention, and would identify necessary modifications and
alternative mechanisms for wider-scale adoption. The basic design of the potential interventions has been
carried out with the assistance of the Bank's health specialists and a specialist of the European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), and was carefully reviewed.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: This would be SEDRONAR's first externally-financed operation. Thus, their
institutional capacity for implementing projects is untested. However, the overall approach is to build on
strong local participation, and SEDRONAR could benefit from knowledge / technology transfer from
programs like FOPAR and SIEMPRO, which are successfully being implemented using similar
community-based approaches and data gathering techniques.
b. Project management: The PIU would be headed by a General Coordinator acceptable to the Bank. In
order to ensure the success of a project that cuts across multiple sectors, it is preferable that this person has
knowledge and experience in social development, and in dealing with international institutions. The PIU
would be also staffed with an INPA Technical Supervisor, a SIME Technical Supervisor and an
Administrative Supervisor whose terms of reference and experience are acceptable to the Bank.
5. Social:
Per aforementioned LIL procedures, social impact assessment would be carried out during project
implementation based on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The assessment would utilize
commonly used techniques, including focus group meetings and sample-based interviews stratified based on
gender, age and other relevant factors. Under the INPA component, gender/age breakdown of municipal
council members, training participants and their attendance to council meetings/training sessions would be
closely monitored. Survey questionnaires used for the Survey-based Epidemiological Study and those used
by the monitoring centers under the SIME component would include additional data elements like education
background, type of employment, marital status and the number of children.
6. Environmental assessment:              Environment Category O A 1 C
O B El FL
No negative environmental impact is expected. There will be no resettlement nor bias against indigenous
populations.
7. Participatory Approach (key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced or may
influence; if participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable):
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Drug prevention is a multi-sector issue, and the participatory approach is central to the project's
design. Relevant sector institutions (education, health, etc.), municipal and provincial governments and
civil society organizations would be represented in the municipal councils. Participation of local youth
groups would be ensured through the support of training projects.
b. Other key stakeholders:

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Per LIL procedures, sustainability of learning would be tracked through the monitoring of performance
indicators described under "D.2 Key Performance Indicators." Fiscal sustainability would be analyzed
during project implementation.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects
A potentially controversial aspect of the project is not what it will attempt to do, but what it will
not do. It does not deal with the production, distribution, or sale of illicit drugs; it does not deal with
treatment and rehabilitation, nor with prosecution of any crimes related to the use and abuse of drugs. It
does not attempt to deal with supply reduction, including price controls and taxation, limiting access, or
public safety. It also does not deal with the issue of the "right to take drugs" as a matter of personal choice
and civil liberty. Instead, the focus of the project is on primary preventative actions, before drug use
becomes a problem, within the broader area of demand reduction.
Another potentially controversial area is the availability of personal data which cou'd be used
-13-



outside the project's scope. For the project to be effective in building trust and securing the participation of
high-risk groups, particularly youths, it is important that participation in any project-sponsered activities is
not compromised by the involvement of police in any law enforcement matter, or in the availability of
information on individuals. Thus, measures will be taken to ensure the confidentiality of data collected
under the project on individuals, and to limit the direct participation of police to community development
officials with the agreement of the participating communities. Data would be collected on a voluntary
basis.

Annex 2: Project Description
ARGENTINA: Integrated Drug Prevention Pilot Project
By Component:
Project Component I - US$5.4 million
Component A: Participatory Approaches to Druz Prevention (INPA - Intervenci6n Participativa)
For the illustration of the INPA component, see Chart 1: INPA Institutional Arrangements below.
The component is designed to promote local solutions to drug use and to strengthen the institutional
capacity of selected municipalities and provinces via: (a) Training local community members and sector
professionals; (b) Training youth leaders; and (c) Financing the implementation of the municipal plans for
drug prevention. Reflecting the pilot nature of the project, only five provinces--expected to be Salta,
Misiones, Santa Fe, Mendoza, and La Pampa--would be identified based on demographics, estimated levels
of drug consumption, and proximity to known drug trafficking routes and regional representation. Within
each province, four municipalities would be identified, two of which would be selected as the pilot
municipalities by SEDRONAR in accordance with the criteria established in the Operational Manual (OM)
of the project. The criteria would include population (i.e. 10,000 or less), proximity to known drug
trafficking routes, estimated levels of drug consumption, sequestration, commitment of local authorities,
presence of NGOs capable of conducting training and other relevant social indicators. SEDRONAR would
complete the selection of the participating provinces and municipalities by December 31, 1999 [see G.
Main Loan Conditions].
As a first step, based on procedures and selection criteria described in the project Operational
Manual, the mayor of each municipality would establish a Consultative Municipal Council (Consejo
Consultivo Municipal-CCM) for drug prevention as an advisory panel. The Council would consist of key
members of the community from various sectors including education, health, religion, gender, and relevant
social development NGOs. Of these 8 appointees, 3 of them would be from the municipal government.
The Council members would establish internal regulations in accordance with the project Operational
Manual (Consejo Consultivo Municipal: Reglamento Interno). To support the CCMs during the pilot
phase under the project, technical assistance would be provided to each of the CCMs through
SEDRONAR-hired consultants.
Special considerations would be made with respect to the participation of local police forces in the
CCMs of the INPA component. All CCMs would be initially created without any representative from
police forces. A member of the municipal department of the provincial police force could be on the CCM
if: (i) the municipal department has a specific division/unit designated to community development,
including the support of the victims and families of violence against women, youth and other vulnerable
groups; (ii) the CCM unanimously approves the participation of a member of the police force on the
council; and (iii) the police force member would be from the division/unit described in (i). The internal
regulations established by the CCM would provide further details of the terms and conditions of the
participation of local police forces.
(i) Training of local municipal actors.  It is currently planned that 20-25 participants, including the
members of the CCMs, as well as other relevant community members and sector professionals, would
attend 5 training modules of 3 weeks each, divided into drug prevention methodology; organizational and
communications skills; and strategic planning. Each module would be split into 1 week of theory and 2
weeks of practical applications. The graduates of these workshops would then write the Municipal Plans
-18-



that are described in sub-component (iii) below, thus designing and owning their own local drug prevention
strategies. In each INPA-participating municipality, all training activities would be carried out by a single
consulting firm contracted by SEDRONAR (hereafter, Training Consultant). Due to the nature of the
assignment, such a consulting firm is likely to be an NGO that is familiar with the local conditions of the
corresponding municipality.
(ii) Youth, culture and solidaritv. The youth of 14-25 years are considered to be most vulnerable to
various temptations and other social as well as family conditions that are known to be conducive to the use
of psychoactive substances, and for this reason, require special attention and approaches different from
those for adult populations. The project would train approximately 30 youths in each municipality,
selected by the CCM based on the criteria specified in the Operational Manual. The selection would be
largely based on each candidate's potential to become a leader among their age group in their respective
communities and a role model for younger children. Training is planned to consist of 5-module workshops
of 3 weeks each, focusing on the consequences of drugs and alcohol consumption, effective
communications skills, as well as other related topics, and would be carried out by the same Training
Consultant for (i) Training of local municipal actors above. As part of the training, selected potential
youth leaders would be encouraged to develop small training projects to prevent drug use in their
communities. In each INPA-participating municipality, the CCM would review proposals and approve up
to 5 training projects for funding of approximately US$1,000 or less each, based on selection criteria
described in the Operational Manual. The funds to support such training projects would be included in the
fee for the Training Consultants.
(iii) Municipal plan for drug prevention. The CCM is expected to assume the central coordination role in
developing and monitoring the implementation of a municipal plan for drug prevention, fully utilizing the
training provided to the council members as well as other key members of the community. The plan would
be submitted to SEDRONAR through the mayor of the municipality as a sub-project proposal. The
municipal plans would include at least one activity designed by the youths in their workshops.
SEDRONAR would review the proposals, and if acceptable, provide sub-project grants of up to
US$150,000 each to support the pilot-implementation of the plans.  This demand-driven and
community-executed sub-project approach is essentially the same as what is known as the social investment
fund approach. The sub-project grant would support the procurement of small goods and the contracting
of consultant services, and both are carried out by the municipalities themselves in accordance with the
procedures specified in the Operational Manual. SEDRONAR would complete the review and approval of
the Municipal Plans by March 1, 2000 [see G. Main Loan Conditions].
Each municipal plan would be a holistic solution developed and executed by local actors and
youths to deal with the drug problem that would otherwise be threatening their community. The
sub-project grant would be provided only in the second (and the last) year of the project, to support the first
year of each municipal plan. However, INPA-participating municipalities would be encouraged to extend
the municipal plan schemes beyond the project completion, and to explore possible source of financing,
including municipal and provincial sources, to support the plan's extension. Ultimately, one of the
indicators of project sustainability would be municipal and provincial budget allocation for continued
prevention efforts, submitted for the year following the project completion.
(iv) Strengthening provincial links. Because the primary partner of the municipalities is the province,
rather than the National Government (i.e., SEDRONAR), it would be essential to start establishing a link
between the municipalities and provinces. In addition, in the future, provinces would require a focal point
for coordinating drug prevention efforts. However, at present, provinces have little incentive to commit
substantial resources for such purposes given the lack of effective prevention models. The project would
-19-



provide for a provincial technical supervisor position (PTS; supervisor tecnico provincial) to facilitate and
coordinate activities between SEDRONAR, the provinces, and the municipalities. By the end of the
project, the participating provinces hopefully would see the value of such roles, and eventually would invest
their own resources in future drug prevention activities.
The aforementioned PTS would participate in the CCMs, but would not have voting powers on
official decisions. In addition, he/she would communicate closely with the monitoring centers established in
the SIME component in the province, and advise the provincial authorities and other relevant actors as
appropriate.
Institutional framework and flow of funds.  In order to ensure the smooth execution of the INPA
Component, SEDRONAR would enter into two types of framework agreements ("Carta de Adhesi6n
Provincial" and "Carta de Adhesion Municipal"). In addition, to support the implementation of the
Municipal Plans, SEDRONAR would enter into a subsidiary agreement (Convenio de Transferencia).
The models of each type of framework and subsidiary agreement are included in the Operational Manual.
The first framework agreement (Carta de Adhesi6n Provincial), made with each of the five
participating provinces, would: (a) specify criteria and procedures to select municipalities; (b) allow
SEDRONAR and the selected municipalities in the province to enter into the second framework agreement
and the subsidiary agreement; (c) allow SEDRONAR to carry out training activities in the selected
municipalities in the province; and (d) specify the terms and conditions of placing a provincial technical
supervisor (i.e. PTS; see the subcomponent (iv) Strengthening provincial links above). The second
framework agreement (Carta de Adhesion Municipal), made with each of the participating municipalities,
would: (a) specify the terms and conditions for establishing the CCM; and (b) allow SEDRONAR-hired
Training Consultant (see below) to carry out the aforementioned training activities in the municipality.
Once SEDRONAR approves the Municipal Plan, developed by the Municipal Council and submitted
through the municipality, SEDRONAR and the municipality would sign a subsidiary agreement, which
specifies the terms and conditions of the provision and the use of grants for the Municipal Plan.
The Bank will review and approve the first Municipal Plan. In addition, a Municipal Plan would
be financed unless SEDRONAR submit to the Bank evidences of the establishment of the corresponding
CCM, the effectiveness of the two framework agreements, SEDRONAR's approval of the Municipal Plan,
and the effectiveness of the subsidiary agreement [see G. Main Loan Conditions].
All training activities in each of the INPA-participating municipalities would be carried out by
consultants (i.e. Training Consultants) contracted by SEDRONAR using TORs and procedures acceptable
to the Bank. The consultant contract would include the administration and management of the funds
ear-marked for the small training projects to be implemented by youth groups (see (ii) Youth, culture and
solidaritv in the above).
Project Component 2 US$1.1 million
Component B: Information Systems, Monitoring and Evaluation (SIME - Sistema de Informaci6n
Monitoreo y Evaluaci6n de Adicciones)
(i) Survey-based Epidemiological Studv. Lack of systematic information on the drug consumption pattern
is a major bottle-neck in formulating and implementing effective policies and strategies. The project would
carry out a nation-wide survey of drug consumption pattern through interviews of a representative sample
of the Argentine population. Survey questions are based on internationally accepted standards, including
-20-



CIDI (Composite International Diagnostic Interview/CIE-10/WHO), DIS (Diagnostic Interview Schedule
version III-A, based on the American Psychiatric InstitutionlDSM-III), DICA-R-A (Diagnostic Interview
for Children and Adolescents/Washington University Division of Child Psychiatry), SCAN (Schedule for
clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry/WHO), and Argentina's SIDUC (Uniformed Information System on
Drugs; Sistema de Informacion uniforme sobre drogas). The survey manual (including survey design and
questionnaire) was reviewed during the appraisal and found acceptable (available in the project file; see
Annex 8, SEDRONAR 2). Survey samples would be approximately 3,000, stratified based on age group,
gender, poverty level (using basic needs indicators, NBI) and urban-rural conditions. Data from EDS (
Encuesta de Desarrollo Social; Social Development Survey) would also be utilized for further analysis,
once SIEMPRO completes its processing. The TORs for the survey would be submitted for the Bank's
review and comments by January 1, 2000, and the survey would be completed and reviewed with the Bank
by March 31, 2000 [see G. Main Loan Conditions].
(ii) Development of Prevention Methods and Training Modules. The project would assist SEDRONAR in
developing effective community-based prevention methods based on international and domestic experience.
These methods would be disseminated through national, regional and provincial workshops. Based on the
methods developed, SEDRONAR would further develop training modules to be used under the INPA
Component for municipal level training (see the paragraphs for (i) Training of Local Municipal Actors and
(ii) Youth, Culture and Solidarity under the INPA Component in the above). Consultants hired to provide
municipal level training would be properly trained in the use of the training modules in advance.
(iii) Network of monitoring centers. In Argentina, a number of hospitals, health clinics, education
institutions, youth support centers, NGOs, religious institutions and other social-sector organizations are
already active in the areas of education for drug prevention, support of drug users and their families in
dealing with addictions and related problems, and emergency and long-term treatment of drug users. The
project would attempt to: (a) strengthen those institutions' capacity in systematically assessing the drug use
pattern and related problems in its locality; and (b) organize them into a network for voluntary information
exchange. If successful, the network would become a network of monitoring centers, analogous to the
network of seismic monitoring centers. Individually, each center would monitor drug-related problems in
their locality. Collectively in the network, the centers would generate information critical to promote drug
prevention more effectively.
For the purposes described in the above, SEDRONAR would select approximately 60 institutions
across the country as monitoring centers in accordance with the criteria detailed in the Operational Manual.
The institutions would be locally-based, and running specific programs closely related to drug prevention
and treatment. The selection process would consider geographic location (i.e. urban-rural combinations,
areas that are considered to be in the route of drug-trafficking, etc.) and the quality and size (i.e. the
number of beneficiaries) of the program run by the institutions. At least one institution would be selected
as a center in each of the municipalities participating in INPA. In addition, in each of INPA-participating
provinces, the provincial technical supervisor would assemble and systematically organize the data made
available from the centers in the provinces for the use of policy makers, the general public and other
concerned parties.
The project would provide each monitoring center with: (i) a PC-based public domain (i.e. free
distribution) database management software called EPINFO designed for easy data entry, statistical
processing and Internet-based communications of survey-based data; (ii) standardized survey question set
and application manual; (iii) training for the use of the software and the survey applications, and data
analysis techniques; and (iv) other necessary technical assistance. Training would also include how to
create and maintain WEB-pages on free WEB-sites.
-21-



The project would assist SEDRONAR in developing and disseminating a set of standard survey
questions, mentioned in (ii) in the previous paragraph. The set would consist of four modules tailored for
each one of the following four types of populations: (a) children; (b) adolescents; (c) patients of emergency
care; and (d) patients of non-emergency care. All modules would be based on internationally accepted
standards, described previously under "(i) Survey-based Epidemiological Study" in the above. In addition,
survey questions would not include any personal identification element, such as name or any type of
personal identification codes. The monitoring centers would be encouraged to interview the beneficiaries
of their services using an appropriate module, process obtained data using the provided software,
periodically submit the data sets to SEDRONAR, and make the sets available on their WEB-sites. In
addition, in INPA-participating provinces, the centers would also be encouraged to submit the data sets to
the Provincial Technical Supervisor (see the INPA description under Component A in the above), who
would assemble and organize the data sets to facilitate consciousness raising, policy formulation and other
public use at the provincial level.
Data submission to SEDRONAR and WEB-based publications mentioned in the above would
be on a strictly voluntary-basis, and the centers would be under no oblization to do so. However,
SEDRONAR would create an honor-based incentive mechanism to encourage active data exchange.
SEDRONAR would validate and verify the quality and the integrity of each data set submitted, and the
centers that submit scientifically valid data sets would be given the status of "Certified Monitoring Center".
Special considerations would be made with respect to the participation of police forces in the
Monitoring Network. No police force would form a part of the network outside the INPA-participating
municipalities.  In the case of INPA-participating municipalities, the municipal department of the
provincial police force could be a monitoring center if: (i) the municipal department has a specific
division/unit designated to community development, including the support of the victims and families of
violence against women, youth and other vulnerable groups; (ii) the INPA-CCM unanimously approves
the participation of police force as a monitoring center; and (iii) the monitoring center would be established
within the division/unit described in (i). The internal regulations established by the CCM would provide
further details of the terms and conditions of the participation of local police forces.
(iv) Monitoring and Evaluation. Due to the complexity of drug issues, comprehensive evaluation of the
proposed project would not be feasible before project completion. However, the project would monitor the
capacity level and performance of CCMs, the nature and the degree of participation by various actors, the
number and the quality of training and technical assistance, the types and quality of information generated,
and the functionality of the information network, indications of behavioral and attitude changes of at-risk
groups, quality of municipal plans and their sustainability implications. Once the project is completed,
SEDRONAR plans to carry out an ex-post impact evaluation of the project through SIEMPRO.
More specifically, the questionnaire to be used for the nation-wide survey under the aforementioned
subcomponent (i) Survey-based Epidemiological Study would include the same set of questions to be used
by each of the monitoring centers. Data sets submitted from monitoring centers, at least 10 of which are
located in INPA-participating municipalities, would be constantly compared to the data obtained from the
nation-wide survey. This way, SEDRONAR hopes to capture some of the impact generated by the INPA
Component.
Institution-building at the INPA-participating municipalities would be monitored and evaluated
based on the quality and implementation progress of the municipal plan, based on the periodic progress
reports submitted by the CCMs as well as consultants contracted for municipal level training.
-22-



Sustainability impact would be evaluated based on the municipal / provincial budget submission for the
year after project completion.
Finally, development of SIME Monitoring Network would be monitored based on the number of
Certified Monitoring Centers (see above) during the given period, and frequency of access to monitoring
center WEB-pages by general public.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.3 million
Component C: Proiect Management
A small Project Implementation Unit (PIU), consisting of a General Coordinator, an INPA
Technical Supervisor, a SIME Technical Supervisor and an Administrative Supervisor would be
established to manage and coordinate. Hiring of these four senior PIU staff, with terms of reference and
qualifications satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan effectiveness. The PIU would be
established under the Subsecretariat for Prevention and Assistance (Subsecretaria de Prevencion y
Asistencia), one of SEDRONAR's two subsecretariats (see Chart 2: Project Management Arrangements in
SEDRONAR below), and assisted by SEDRONAR's administrative unit.

Annex 4: Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
ARGENTINA: Integrated Drug Prevention Pilot Project
Summary of benefits and costs:
While interest in judging the cost-effectiveness of different prevention initiatives has grown, very
few published studies are available. The actual costs and benefits included in an economic evaluation will
depend on the questions asked and the perspective taken. However, the costs of prevention activities would
generally fall into the following categories:
*  direct costs to the agency delivering the intervention;
*  direct costs to other agencies involved in the intervention;
*  direct costs to the individuals participating in the intervention; and
*  indirect productivity costs.
The direct costs of the intervention include all staff costs and resources (such as leaflets, telephone
bills, and so on). Many of these costs may be directly observable, although calculating staff time when
staff are engaged in more than one intervention may present some difficulty. It is important, however, to
include all resources used, including capital and management expenses, in the intervention. It would be
important to examine the ratio of fixed costs and recurrent costs, as some programs may require
considerable initial capital costs. Also, drug-prevention programs may involve many actors, especially in
community-based initiatives. Support may be given 'in kind', such as volunteer time and donated resources,
rather than in the form of directly accounted resources, although those are often difficult to quantify.
Furthermore, there may be costs incurred by the individuals involved or their families. Programs may
require travel or other monetary expenses. Indirect costs in terms of lost productivity, usually valued in
terms of the individuals earning capacity, could be an important element to examine.
The potential benefits of drug-prevention programs could also be divided into several categories
such as:
*  health benefits to the individuals targeted by the intervention;
*  consumption benefits of the intervention;
*  other non-health benefits;
*  social diffusion effects; and
*  effects on future resource use.
Which individual health outcome is chosen to be measured will be determined by the economic
evaluation design. Problems associated with drug use, however, include an extremely wide range of issues,
among them physical health, mental health, employment, criminal activity and personal relationships.
Prevention programs could have various qualitative and quantitative effects on an individual's life across
many dimensions. It could, therefore, be argued that some of the existing methods are inadequate to capture
the full range of benefits, such as improved life skills and self-esteem which are often the goals of many
primary-prevention drug programs. These benefits could be approximated using means like willingness to
pay, or other monetary measures. Drug-prevention programs can also provide a range of potential social
benefits. It has been suggested that the benefits of many forms of intervention are underestimated because
the unit of measurement is often limited to program participants It would be useful to consider the benefits
arising from the social diffusion of the intervention throughout the community. Such effects can be seen,
for instance, in the sharp reduction in smoking in many OECD countries. Society may also benefit from a
-27-



low rate u(i drug-related problems as a result of a successful prevention program. These may be in the form
of direct e4fects, such as a lower rate of HIV infection, or in the form of reduced resources needed for
health, social-care and criminal-justice activities directed at drug misusers. In the case of drug treatment,
these social benefits from reduced drug use have been substantial.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
ARGENTINA: Integrated Drug Prevention Pilot Project
Procurement
The project procurement arrangments were developed on the basis of an agency capacity
assesment carried out during appraisal. Procurement under the proposed project would be relatively
simple compared with a large majority of Bank-financed projects. The project would procure a small
amount of goods, and the all remaining procurement activities would be contracting of consultants services.
There would be no civil works under the project. Procurement procedures specified in the project's draft
Operational Manual was reviewed during the appraisal and the negotiations. Adoption of the Operational
Manual acceptable to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness [see G. Main Loan Conditions].
Although this would be the first Bank-financed project implemented by the SEDRONAR, the
Secretariat has an administrative unit with general experience on procurement under the Argentinean law.
In addition, the present head of the administrative unit acquired experience with Bank-financed projects (the
Social Protection Project and the Fourth Social Protection Project) during in his previous assignments at
the Social Development Secretariat (SDS). Furthermore, technical assistance on procurement would be
provided from the Administrative and Financial Coordination Unit (Unidad de Coordinaci6n
Administrativo-Financiera; UCAF) of the SDS as necessary. In order to further ensure adequate handling
of procurement matters, an Administrative Supervisor, with Terms of Reference and qualification
satisfactory to the Bank, would be hired, as a condition of effectiveness [see G. Main Loan Conditions], to
form part of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The Bank has recommended that the Administrative
Supervisor and other relevant SEDRONAR staff responsible for procurement participate in relevant
training programs offered by the Bank.
Procurement methods (Table A)
Goods
Goods under this project would be procured in accordance with the national shopping procedure,
based on quotations from at least three qualified suppliers. Personal computer hardware, peripheral
equipment, software and furniture for the use of the PIU, each the Provincial Technical Supervisors (PTSs;
Supervisores Tecnicos Provinciales) and each of the Consultative Municipal Council (Consejo Consultivo
MVunicipal; CCM) are estimated to cost US$100,000 or less in total, and would be procured by the PIU in
three packages. Goods to be purchased under each of the Municipal Plans would be computer-hardware
and software, photocopier, furniture and other small office equipment and items. However, due to the
demand driven nature of the Municipal Plan, it is not possible to estimate the amount of purchases ex-ante.
Each Municipal Plan would include a detailed procurement plan, and procurement would be handled by the
Municipalities themselves.
Consultants' Services
Technical assistance and training under project components would be carried out by individual
consultants or consulting firms hired in accordance with Guidelines: Selection aiid Enployment of
Consultants hb World Bank Borrowers published by the Bank in January 1997 and revised in September
1997 and January 1999 (the Consultant Guidelines). Consultants to be hired under this project would fall
under the following three categories: (i) individual consultants to be hired by SEDRONAR for project
management and coordination; (ii) consulting firms and individual consultants to be hired by SEDRONAR
-30-



for the provision of training (including seminars and workshops) under both INPA and SIME components,
technical assistance to provinces and municipalities under the INPA Component; and (iii) consulting firms
and individual consultants to be hired by the Municipalities to carry out specific studies, technical
assistance and training activities under the Municipal Plans. The table below summarizes the planned
consultants' services requiring Bank financing under the project.

(*) Each Municipal Plan is limited to $150,000 in total, and includes both goods and consultants. Due to
the demand-driven nature of the Municipal Plan, it is not possible to determine the number and the cost of
consultant contracts ex-ante.
All consultants under categories (i) and (ii) would be contracted by SEDRONAR. These would
include the Provincial Technical Supervisors and the Municipal Coordinators, who would be seconded to
the provinces and the municipalities, respectively. Regarding category (iii), because of the demand-driven
nature of the Municipal Plan, which includes both goods and consultants, it is not possible to estimate the
amount of contracts ex-ante. Like in the case of goods, each Municipal Plan would include terms of
references and a detailed procurement plan, and contracting would be would be handled by the
Municipalities themselves.
Under the project, consultants would be selected and contracted in accordance with the QCBS
(Quality- and Cost-based Selection) procedures. However, the QBS (Selection based on Consultant's
Qualifications) may be used to contract a consulting firm if the estimated contract value is less than US$
100,000. Similarly, individual consultants may be selected on the basis of their qualifications for the
assignment. Individuals employed by the Borrower shall meet all relevant qualifications and shall be fully
capable of carrying out the assignment. Capability is judged on the basis of academic background,
experience and, as appropriate, knowledge of the local conditions, such as local language, culture,
administrative system, and government organization.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
The Bank's prior review would be required for:
*   Goods: None for goods procured by SEDRONAR;
*   Consultants' Services: (a) all contracts for consulting firms estimated to cost US$ 100,000 equivalent
or above; (b) all contracts with individuals (new or renewals) estimated to cost US$ 50,000 equivalent
or more in aggregate during the calendar year; (c) single source selection of consulting firms; (d)
assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank, including key staff positions of
the project unit; (e) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the
contract value to US$ 100,000 equivalent or above; (f) amendments to contracts for the employment of
individual consultants raising the contract value to US$ 50,000 equivalent or above; and (g) terms of
reference (TOR), except for those consultants employed under the Municipal Plans (SEDRONAR
would carry out the prior review of the TOR of the consultants to be contracted under the Municipal
Plans).
-31 -



*   Grants: No disbursement would be made under the disbursement category "3. Grants" until the Bank
has reviewed and approved the first Municipal Plan [see G. Main Loan Conditions].
Ex-post Review
SEDRONAR would contract an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank no later than
December 31, 1999 to carry out the procurement and financial audits of the Municipal Plans, which are
expected to come into effect for the calendar year 2000 [see G. Main Loan Conditions, 2. Other]. Other
procurement actions would be reviewed during the semi-annual Bank supervision missions.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
The project's financial management arrangements, including the installation progress of a
computerized financial management system capable of producing adequate project management reports as
required by the Bank, have been reviewed by the Bank's financial management specialist, and found
acceptable [see Annex 8: Documents in the Project File]. Due to the small size and the pilot nature of the
project, LACI would not be applicable. The project is expected to be completed in 24 months by June 30,
2001, and the loan closing date would be December 31, 2001. Considering the degree of preparation
already undertaken by SEDRONAR and to facilitate prompt start of the project, retroactive financing of up
to 10 percent of the loan or US$ 475,000 would be available to cover eligible expenditures for the
disbursement categories "1. Goods", "2. Consultants' Services" and "4. Project Implementation" incurred on
or after December 1, 1998 but no more than 12 months prior to loan signing. This is justified on the basis
that a well developed draft Operational Manual and background study documents were received December
1998.
Disbursement Category 4. Project Implementation includes: (i) travel by Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) staff and Provincial Technical Supervisors (PTSs); (ii) utilities and communications for the PIU
and PTSs; and (iii) office and other miscellaneous supplies.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Withdrawal applications for consultants' services with a contract value of US$ 100,000 or more,
and US$ 50,000 or more, for the employment of firms and individual consultants, respectively, would be
supported by full documentation. All other disbursements would be made on the basis of Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs) against eligible expenditures. Supporting documentation for these expenditures
would be maintained by the SEDRONAR, and would be made available for periodic review by the Bank.
Special account:
A Special Account (SA) of US$600,000, corresponding to 4 months-worth of the project costs,
would be opened for this project in the Banco de la Naci6n Argentina.
The SEDRONAR would submit replenishment applications for the SA on a monthly basis, or
whenever 20 percent of the authorized allocation has been used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment
applications will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the SA and a
reconciliation bank statement of the SA against the Bank's records. The SA would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank for review
and approval within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
