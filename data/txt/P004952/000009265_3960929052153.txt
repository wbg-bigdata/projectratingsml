First Petroleum Project
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         SONATRACH (Societe Nationale pour la Recherche, la
Production, le Transport, la Transformation esc la
Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures).
Guarantor:        Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria.
Loan Amount:      US$100 million.
Terms:            Seventeen years, including a 5-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
ProjZect          The project's primary objectives are to: (i) help the
Objectives:       Government and SONATRACH in their efforts to attract
investments in exploration and development by foreign oil
companies; (ii) help improve the efficiency of the petroleum
services subsector (and particularly of drilling
operations); (iii) help SONATRACH optimize the production of
its oil fields through enhanced oil recovery schemes; and
(iv) address environmental problems related to drilling and
production operatlons. A related objective is to help
SONATRACH mob.lize external funds through co-financing
arrangements with Eximbank of Japan, and more generally, to
facilitate SONATRACH's efforts at reentering the
international capital markets.
Prolect           The project comprises four components: (i) assistance for
Descriotion:      the promotion of exploration acreage to foreign oil
companies, including basin studies, the setting up of a
modern exploration data base, promotional and contractual
assistance, and the services of full-time foreign experts;
(ii) technical assistance and training in drilling
supervision; (iii) selected enhanced oil recovery
subprojects and related studies; and (iv) training and other
technical assistance inter alia in the area of organization,
financial systems, platning optimization, and environmental
protection.
Benefits and      Project benefits would include an enhanced ability to
&iskm:            attract and/or foster private investments and financing, as
well as improvements in SONATRACH's own efficiency
(including investment planning and environmental management
capabilities). In addition, the enhanced oil recovery
subprojects would be highly profitable and would generate
very substantial foreign earnings. Main risks associated
with the oil recovery projects concern reservoir
performance, project implementation, and oil price
uncertainty. These risks are considered acceptable in light



- ii -
of (i) the detailed reservoir studies which have been
carried out, (ii) SONATRACH's extensive experience with
secondary recovery schemes, and (iii) the fact that oil
prices would have to decrease to unrealistic levels for the
projects to become uneconomic.

ALGERIA
FIRST PETROLEUM PROJECT
1. SIECTOR CONTX
A.
1.1     Since Algeria's independence, hydrocarbons have been and remain to
this day, the dominant sector in the country's economy. They account for
almost all of the country's energy resources and primary energy production,
represent the bulk of merchandise exports (96X). and still provide a major
share of the Government's budgetary revenues (381). While retaining this
critical role in the economy, the hydrocarbon sector has undergone very
significant changes over the last thirty years. One major change has been the
diversification of both production and exports which took place since 1962 as
a result of the Government's policy to develop downstream activities and to
tap Algeria's enormous gas reser-ves: while Algeria, in 1962, was essentially a
producer and exporter of crude oil, it has become a major producer and
exporter Af gas liquids (condensates and LPGs), refined petroleum products,
LNG (liquified natural gas, in which it was a world pioneer) and piped natural
gas. Another development has been the growth of domestic energy consumption
(which now accounts for 14X of total primary energy production) and most
particularly of natural gas, which resulted from the country's rapid
industrialization combined with a zelatively low energy efficiency (itself
induced, until recently, by low energy prices). Final'v, major changes have
occurred in the sector's institutional framework, and are still underway;
whereas, since the nationalizations of 1971 and throug the mid-1980s, most
petroleum activities had remained concentrated in SONATRACH (the national oil
company) and a few related public enterprises, the Government has now opened
up the sector to investment by foreign oil companies; a number of new
exploration contracts have already been signed and major joint-ventures in
downstream activities are currently being negotiated.
S. Unkage to the Economy
1.2     First and foremost, the hydrocarbon sector represents the country's
major source of revenues. Because of the importance of such revenues for
Algeria, the collapse in international oil prices of 1986, which led to a 381
fall in total exports in 1986, largely explains the contraction of GDP growth
from an average growth of 4.5 p.a. in 1980-85 to an average decline of 0.5X
between 1986 and 1988. In 1989, hydrocarbons still accounted for 96X of total
Algerian exports (US$9.1 billion). In spite of recent efforts to promote
exports of industrial and other products, hydrocarbons are expected to remain
the predominant source of export earnings for years to come (about US$22
billion or 90X of total projected exports in 1998). The prospects for
continued hydrocarbon export revenues and their continued diversification also
provide th3 Government with added flexibility in mobilizing external
borrowings in order to finance its balance of payment deficit. Direct taxes
assessed on hydrocarbons production and profits amounted to US$4.3 billion in



1'88, accounting for 26% of total Government revenuesAl; another US$1.4
billion of ad valorem taxes were assessed on domestic sales of ref4ned
products, providing the Government with a total of US$5.7 billion in
petroleum-related fiscal revenues. Massive investments in oil and gas were
required through the 1970s and early 1980s in order to support the country's
diversification strategy, averaging US$1.5 billion p.a. between 1985 and 1987.
Major investments were also carried out during that same period in
hydrocarbon-based industries, most particularly petrochemicals and
fertilizers. Although the sector's share of total egRloymsnt is relatively
low, it comprises a large part of the country's highly skilled staff, both at
technical and managerial level, since it has traditionally benefited from
substantial training resources.

1.3     Algeria's substantial energy resources consist mostly of natural gas,
gas liquids and crude oil, alhtough there are also minor coal deposits, a
limited potential for the generation of hydroelectricity, uranium deposits,
geothermal resources and solar energy. Proven na_tt-ral Zas reserves at the
beginning of 1989 amounted to about 3,200 billion cubic meters (BCM) or 3,000
billion tons of oil equivalent (toe), accounting for nearly 4% of proven world
reserves. These reserves include estimates for condensates and LPGs (about
570 million toe). Proven gas reserves correspond to about 60 years of
production at current levels. At the beginning of 1989, Algeria's proven
recoverable reserves of crude oil amounted to about 775 million tons, most of
which were discovered before 1962. This figure corresponds to about 22 years
of production at current rates, one of the lowest ratios among Lajor producing
countries. Although recent discoveries of crude oil have been small and have
not added significantly to reserves, forthcoming secondary and tertiary
recovery schemes could increase proven reserves by a sizeable amount (see
para. 1.10). Algeria's gpal reserves--about 40 million tons (30 million toe)-
-are located mainly in the Abadla Basin in the southwest; none of them,
however, are currently commercially exploitable, and Algeria imported 1.4
million ton (1 million toe) of coking coal in 1987. Most of Algeria's limited
bydroelectr_i potential is already being exploited.  Average annual generation
from controlled storage is about 320 GWh, supplemented by an avera,e of 70
GUh/year from small run-of-river plants and 50 GWh/year from plants associated
with irrigation schemes. Current itastalled capacity is 285 MW, of which 194
KW could be considered firm power. Uranium reserves in the extreme south of
the country are estimated at 25,000 tons of uranium metal. Preliminary
geophysical and hydrogeochemical studies indicate the presence of substantial
geotheral, s-olar and wind energy resources, which could be exploited at some
future date.

Petoleum Ex,tlaon
1.4     Although petroleum exploration in Algeria began at the end of the
19th century in the Chelif basin, the first commercial discovery dates back
only to 1948; intensive exploration in the Sahara started in 1953, resulting
in the discovery of the giant Hassi-Messaoud (oil) and Hassi R'Mel (gas)
fields in 1956. In the following years, additional fields were discovered in
the Ilizi, Ghadames and Oued Mya Saharan basins, and more recently further
south in the Ahnet basin (gas). Details on Algeria's petroleum geology and
exploration history are provided in Annex 1.12.
1.5     With most of main discoveries having taken place almost 30 years ago,
Algeria is now a mature oil producer and future exploration in the producing
areas of the Eastern and Southeastern Sahara is unlikely to yield very large
discoveries. However, the use of modern exploration techniques in these
areas, which are generally considered oil-prone and low-risk, is likely to
lead to small or medium-size discoveries which would boost the country's
reserves. On the other hand, the vast areas of the Western and Southwestern
Sahara remain largely unexplored due to the distance from existing
infrastructure and the fact they have been so far considered mostly gas-
prone; the possibility of finding major reserves of oil and/or gas in these
basins cannot be discarded and their exploration is now a priority. A first
and important step in that direction will be the undertaking by SONATRACH of
several integrated basin studies to be financed under the project (see chapter
III).
Leasl and Contractual Framework
1.6         Algerian policy in the late 1970's to mid-1980's had been to rely
essentially on SONATRACH for most of the country's exploration efforts,
effectively discouraging any substantial investment by foreign oil companies
through rigid and unattractive contractual and fiscal terms. A major shift in
policy was undertaken in 1986 with the realization that the country's crude
oil reserves were not being replenished through new discoveries, and the
decision to attract foreign investment to complement and enhance (through the
introduction of modern exploration techniques) SONATRACH's efforts. As the
basis for its new policy, the Government enacted a new Petroleum Code (Law 36-
14 of August 19, 1986 and subsequent decrees) which has modernized the
previous framework and provides considerable latitade to the Ministry of Mines
and Industries (MMI) and SONATRACH to conclude exploration and production
contracts with foreign firms. The new law allows for four types of
contractual arrangements between SONATRACH (as sole holder of the mining
title, or permit) and foreign companies: joint stock companies, unincorporated
joint ventures, service contracts and production-sharing arrangements. Only
the last two are currently being pursued, with most companies preferring the
production-sharing version.
1.7     Since promulgation of the new Code, a total of eleven exploration
contracts have been signed with seven European and North American companies
(see map) and several others are under negotiations. SONATRACH has agreed to
a wide variety of economic formulas in the contracts they have negotiated,



- 4 -
reflecting a new flexibility; this is especially the case for the production-
sharing versions, for which the law gives only the very general guideline that
the 'foreign associate's" share must not exceed 49Z of total project revenues.
On some contracts, SONATRACH is carried only through the exploration and
appraisal stage, paying its (minimum 51%) share only after commercial
discovery; in others, it never contributes to project costs, with the company
paying SONATRACH's share and recovering the monies advanced for this purpose
from a percentage (substantially less than half) of SONATRACH's share in
production. The signing of these new contracts marks a sharp departure from
previous restrictive policies. However, their number so far is not
commensurate with a country with the size and potential of Algeria; this
points to a need for better organizing and structuring the promotion process
while improving on both the form and the substance of the contractual/legal
framework for exploration (eg. through the elaboration of a single model
contract, and the inclusion of provisions to make exploration in gas-prone
areas more attractive and to permit tax creditability for US companies). In
order to address these weaknesses, SONATRACH recently established a new
Department in charge of joint ventures; specialized assistance (including tax
and legal advice, training, etc.) to this new Department is included in the
proposed project (see chapter III).
1.8     Although the opening up to private investment had so far been
restricted to exploration of new acreage, a major breakthrough was achieved
very recently (April 1991) with the signing of a joint-venture agreement
between SONATRACH and CFP (Total) for the development of the Hamra condensate
field (about 150 MMB oil equivalent and total investments estimated at US$500
million); this is the first time a foreign oil company is allowed to invest in
the development of already proven reserves and it clearly paves the way for
the future involvement of oil companies in the massive program of enhanced oil
recovery in fields currently produced by SONATRACH, which is critical to
Algeria's oil future (see para. 1.36).
cQ%W9e Oil Reserves and Production
1.9     Reserves.  Of original recoverable reserves of crude oil of about
1,750 million tons, about 1,010 million tons have been produced, leaving
remaining recoverable reserves of 740 million tons, as of January 1, 1990.
About 66% of remaining recoverable reserves are in the Hassi Messaoud Region,
and 11% and 9% in Haoud Berkaoui and Rhourde El Baguel respectively, the next
two largest fields. Algerian crude oil is light (0.8 density) and without
sulphur, ensuring its marketability. The following table illustrates the
current reserve situation:

(as of 11/190)
7,500     1,750 (232)   1,010 (58%)       740
NB: These figures do not include additional recoverable reserves which can
be produced by future enhanced recovery schemes as such additions are only
incorporated at the time such projects come into effect.



1.10    Production of crude oil fell during the 1980s, from 52 million tons
in 1979 to 32 million tons in 1988 (Annex 1.4). This fall occurred because of
the gradual depletion of existing reserves coupled with a policy of
controlling production in accordance with OPEC quotas. Production increased
again to 33.6 millio.i tons in 1989 and 35.3 million tons in 1990 as a result
of recent investments in secondary recovery (i.e. through enhanced recovery
methods such as water or gas injection). Currently, about 70a of Algeria's
crude oil production is provided by secondary recovery means (75X in Hassi
Messaoud, 30X at Haoud Berkaoui and 352 at Rhourde El Baguel). The
implementation of additional secondary and tertiary recovery schemes in the
regions of Haoud Berkaoui, Hassi Messaoud, Hassi R'Mel, Rhourde El Baguel, Tin
Fouye, Tabankort and Stah should permit maintenance of overall crude
production at slightly above the current rate until about 1993 (37 million
tons)" after which time, in the absence of further new enhanced recovery
schemes or significant new discoveries, productia- from existing fields would
decline again (30 million tons by 2000).
Gas Reserves -anPM.gdjon
1.11    Algeria had about 3,200 BCM of proven recoverable natural gas in
place as of January 1, 1990, of which 70% were in the Hassi R'Kel region.
Natural gas produced in association with crude oil (associated gas) is
injected after removal of the gas liquids for purposes of enhanced crude oil
recovery (pressure maintenance schemes). With the introduction of gas
injection projects, the amount of flared gas has diminished to negligible
levels. Algeria's sales of dry natural gas come entirely from noni-associated
gas reservoirs, nearly all in the Hassi R'Mel region. More than half of gross
production is reinjected after removal of the gas liquids. This is the result
of a deliberate policy by SONATRACH to produce gas in excess of market
requirements in order to increase ultimate recovery cf these liquids.31
1.12    Detailed data for natural gas production, trade and consumption are
shown in Annex 1.3. Gross production more than doubled between 1979 and 1985,
from 43.6 BCM to 90.7 BCM and grew by 7.2X per year from 1985 to 1989,
reaching 119.6 bcm. Gas transported to market, grew by 8.72 per year from
1979 to 1985 and by 6.72 per year from 1985 to 1989, reaching 43.9 bcm in that
year. This slower growth is due to the fact that an increasing proportion of
the gross production was reinjected into the reservoirs after removing the gas
liquids. Whereas in 1978 most (81X) of the gas transported was sold to gas
liquefaction plants for exports (see para. 1.24), this proportion fell to 53X
in 1989 as pipeline exports of natural gas became significant after 1982
(reaching 9.0 BCM in 1989) and domestic consumption of natural gas grew
rapidly (reaching 9.0 BCH in 1988) as a result of the country's fuel
substitution policy.

significantly from 1979 (4.9 and 0.8 million tons respectively) to 1989 (16.8
and 4.8 million tons) (Annex 1.4). The bulk of the production of conder.sates
and LPGs comes from the Hassi R'Mel region (LPGs are separated in the Arzew
Jumbo plant). LPGs are also produced at refineries and gas liquefaction
plants, with such production increasing from 0.4 Mt in 1980 to 1.1 Mt in 1988.
Production of condensates is expected to further increase until 1995 but
decrease afterwards as declining recovery from the gas at Hassi R'Mel is less
than fully offset by increasiag recovery from other gas regions. All of the
condensa'ps are projected to be exported. Detailed supply and demand
forec'    for natural gas and gas liquids are shown in Annexes 1.6, 1.7 and
1.8.
D. Domestic Demand and Pricing
1.14    Algeria's per capita energy consumption (about 1 toe per year) is
much higher than in neighbouring countries (about double that of Tunisia and
four times that of Morocco) whereas its per capita income would not be
correspondingly higher when measured on a purchasing parity basis. However,
its per capita energy consumption is not high relative to similar petroleum
exporting countries such as Mexico and Venezuela. Nevertheless, Algeria's
ratio of energy demand growth to GDP growth is very high (2.9 from 1980 to
1988) compared to 0.7 in Morocco (1980-1988) and 0.5 in Tunisia (1986-1989).
Algeria's high and increasing energy intensit7 is attributable to: significant
energy use by the large and relatively fast-growing energy industries
(especially gas liquefaction for which use of natural gas as fuel accounts for
about one-sixth of total domestic demand); historically low energy prices,
only partly justified by low economic costs (paras. 1.17 and 1.19); and the
poor productivity that has characterized the industrial sector. Energy demand
by final domestic consumers has consistently grown more rapidly than primary
energy production, and absorbed 15X of a total primary production of 97.5 Mtoe
in 1988 (Annexes 1.1 and 1.2). However, the growth of final consumption
slowed down significantly from 11.32 per year in 1972-80 to 2.9X in 1985-88,
as a result of the slowdown in economic growth. The structure of final energy
consumption reflects Algeria's very rapid ineustrialization since indepen-
dence, with industry and construction's share roughly doubling since 1965.
Algez'2as industrial progress is even more emphatically shown by the size of
gas liquefaction, petroleum refining, electricity generation, and
petrochemical and fertilizer production. Net generation by the national
electricity company, SONELGAZ, grew by an average 10.3X per year from 5481 GWh
in 1979 to 14610 GWh in 1989, with most of it generated by :team and combus-
tion turbine units fuelled by natural gas. Estimates of forecast domestic
energy demand based on projections made by MMI and SONELGAZ show an average
growth of 4.71 per year between 1990 and 2000 (see Annex 1.7). This rate of
growth, however, is likely to be dependent on domestic pricing policies as
well as the success of energy conservation efforts undertaken by industrial
enterprises in the context of their planned restructuring.

condensates and LPGs are shown in Annexes 1.4 and 1.5. Algeria has rapidly
increased its petroleum refining capacity, thereby enabling an increasing
proportion of oil to be exported in the form of refined petroleum products.
While crude oil exports fell from 45.1 million tons in 1979 to 13.0 million
tons in 1989, exports of refined petroleum products grew from 2.9 million tons
in 1979 to 13.4 million tons in 1989. The growth of domestic consumption of
refined petroleum slowed down significantly from 7.7X per year between 1979
and 1985 to 1.11 per year between 1985 and 1988 to reach a level of 6.3
million tons (201 of total crude oil production). These rates of growth are
below those for domestic natural gas consumption, indicating substitution of
gas for petroleum products, particularly in the industrial sector. In 1988,
gas oil and gasoline accounted for 851 of domestic refined petroleum products
consumption, the only other significant oil products consumed being jet fuel,
and bitumens and lubricants produced from imported heavy oil. Domestic LPG
consumption (nearly all by households, but also some by vehicles) was
significant in 1988 at 1.2 million tons, but its growth rate was a fairly low
2.91 per year from 1985 to 1988. In the future, about 21.5 million tons of
crude oil (including 0.5 million tons of imported heavy crude) are expected to
be sent to Algerian refineries (based on nearly full capacity utilization) and
the rest exported. Exports of refined products are projected to diminish
gradually as domestic consumption grows. The latter, consisting almost
entirely of gasoline and gas oil, is projected to grow at a modest 4.41 per
year as a result of competition from natural gas and LPGs. Detailed supply
and demand forecasts for crude oil and refined products are shown in
Annex 1.9.
DomesUc Gas Consumtilon
1.16    Annex 1.8 includes a detailed breakdown of domestic demand for
natural gas and points out to a substantial use by energy industries (mostly
LNG plants) and for thermal power generation. As a result of SONELGAZ's
massive investments in gas-fired stati.ons, consumption by the power sector is
expected to continue to grow rapidly in the future, from 4.9 Mtoe in 1990 to
9.0 Mtoe by 2000. Consumption of energy for non-energy uses grew from 0.6 Mtoe
in 1980 to 1.8 ttoe in 1988 (Annex 1.2), mostly for production of fertilizers
and petrochemicals. The development of these industries has been undertaken
by two companies formed after the reorganization of SONATRACH: the Enterprise
Nationale d'Engrais et de Produits Phytosanitaires (ASMIDAL) and che
Entreprise Nationale de la Petrochimie (ENIP).
D_etc Enav Pricina
1.17    Government policy, which was reaffirmed in the context of the
negotiations of the recently-approved IMF standby loan, is to bring domestic
prices of most energy products in line with economic cost so as to encourage
energy conservation and substitution of natural gas for petroleum products
while enpbling the energy supply and distribution enterprises to achieve
financial equilibrium. Until early 1991, however, the gap between retail



- 8 -
prices and economic cost had remained substantial for most energy products,
and even increased in recent years due to t1s depreciation of the Algerian
dinar (59% between late 1987 and early 1991). As a result implicit economic
subsidies on petroleum products were estimated to total US$1.0 billion
annually at prices prevailing at the beginning of 1991.V The Government has
therefore set as its objective the elimination of all subsidies on energy
products, with the possible exception of LPG for household use (for which
subsidies have been a critical tool of the Government's fight against
deforestation). Given the size of the gap to be covered, the authorities have
proposed, and the Bank agrees, that this objective could only be met in
several stages. The first stage has already been carried out, with the
implementation, effective January 1 and April 1, 1991, of steep increases in
the prices of jet fuel (200%, with another 36% due in September 1991); fuel
oil (215%); lube oil (161%); and propane (29%). These increases (equivalent
to an average 26X overall increase on all products) are expected to bring
about a r3duction of about 50% in total implicit subsidies. As a result, and
as shown in the following table, prices of petroleum products are now about in
line (or will be in September 1991 in the case of jet fuel) with economic cost
(measured as border prices plus internal distribution margins), excepr for gas
oil and LPG; due to remaining discrepancies on the latter, product prices on a
weighted average basis, are currently at about 64X of economic cost.

1.19    Natural Gas. While Algeria's limited oil reserves provide a
justification for setting petroleum product prices close to the international
level, the much larger reserves of natural gas (relative to current and
prospective demand) and the expectation that exports cculd not be greatly
increased without large price adjustments in international markets provide a
justification for setting prices for domestic gas sales below the export
price. The appropriate benchmark in this case is the long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) of production, transmission and distribution plus a "depletion premiim"
which reflects the opportunity cost of using the resource today rather thar.
saving it for the future.V Detailed assumptions and calculations for the
economic cost of natural gas at various pressure levels are included in
Annex 1.10 and a comparison of these costs with gas prices effsctive April 1,
1991 is shown in the table below:
Ta.Le 1.3: COMPARISON OF DOMESTIC GAS PRICES WITH ECONO"IC COST

Weighted average 4.11    0.64   0.85           75
The above domestic prices reflect the latest increases which took place on
January 1 and April 1, 1991 (2882 for HP; 32X for MP; and 20X for LP).
Further quarterly increases of 72 have already been scheduled for June 1 and
September 1, 1991 at medium and low pressures.
1.20   The above comparison shows that retail prices for medium and low
pressure, at US$1.20 per MMBtu, are at 58X and 52X of economic cists (662 and
592 respectively if forthcoming quarterly increases are factored in), while
the price for high pressure, at US$0.66 per MMBtu is already at 1002 of the
corresponding economic cost. On a weighted average basis, retail gas prices
are at 752 of economic costs (80X with forthcoming increases), which is
considered acceptable. Although there is a more significant discrepancy
between SONATRACH's field cost (US$0.55 per MMBtu)v and its transfer price tn
SONELGAZ (US$0.13 per MKBtu), this does not lead to any significant
misallocation of resources as SONELGAZ plans its investment program, nearly
all of it based on the use of gas as fuel, using the economic cost of gas
rather than the actual transfer price; although the implication on the two

firms' finances is not a matter of immediate concern (SONATRACH's finances
being healthy, contrary to those of SONELGAZ), the Government has indicated
its intention to gradually adjust upwards the gas transfer price to bring it
in line with economic cost.
E. Hydrocarbon Exporl
1.21    The following table illustrates clearly the historical and forecast
impact of Algeria's diversification strategy on the structure of its
hydrocarbons exports:

It points out to the dramatic shift which has been taking place over the last
10 years, away from crude oil and towards natural gas and gas liquids, and
which has enabled Algeria to maximize its revenues in spite of OPEC production
ceilings and the technical constraints imposed by decreasing crude oil
reserves. This trend is likely to continue in the next ten years as Algeria
embarks on a major program to expand gas and gas liquids exports (see below).
Details of volume forecasts by product are included in Annex 1.6,
Attachment 2.
Crde Oil. Refined Products and Gas LUuids
1.22 Exports of crude oil and refined products are determined by production
levels and refining capacity on the one hand and the growth of domestic
consumption on the other (Annex 1.4). Their marketing does not pose a problem
as both crude and refined products are readily tradeable on the international
market (usually on a spot basis). Production (and by extension exports) of
condensates and LPGs is essentially determined by the capacity for liquid
extraction and gas treatment, and reinjection (which itself is planned in
function of technical optimization criteria concerning the gas recycling
process), since the size of gas reserves is currently not a constraint.
Export figures shown above reflect the country's plans for a major expansion
of such treatment facilities, primarily in the Hassi aHel and Arzew areas.
There again, market is not a constraint as both condensates and LPGs are
readily tradeable.

Iluled Natua Gas (LNG)
1.23 Unlike exports of crude oil and liquid products, exports of natural gas
are subject to demand constraints, in addition to constraints related to
liquefaction and transport (LNG carrier ships) capacity. Algeria's current
nominal liquefaction capacity of 31.1 BCM is distributed as follows:
Site                   Stert-up Date  CaDacity (billion m3)
Arzew GL 4Z               1964              1.7

Skikda GL 1K              1972              8.4
Total   31.1
1.24 As a result of the Government and SONATRACH's past gas marketing and
pricing strategy and the slower than expected growth of the international gas
market, which resulted in the loss of significant markets (eg. the El Paso
contracts of the early 1980s in the US), this capacity has never been fully
utilized, with LNG production fluctuating between 6 and 12 BCM from 1980 to
1986. Starting in 1987, the Government's more aggressive marketing strategy
(see below) has led to a significant increase in production (up to 17.3 BCM in
1989 and 18.6 BCM in 1990, respectively 56X and 60Z of installed capacity).
With firm contracts currently totalling about 25 BCM per year by 1995 (with
European and US customers) and reasonably conservative expectations for new
contracts with US and Eastern European customers it is estimated that Algeria
will be able to raise its LNG sales to 32 BCM by 1995 and 35.3 BCM by 2000.
These figures are based on the assumptions that the forthcoming
debottlenecking/revamping (and expected concomitant expansion) of Algeria's
liquefaction installations will proceed on schedule (initial engineering
studies have recently been completed by three major international firms).
PiDed Natural Gao
1.25 Following completion in 1982 of the TransMed I pipeline to Italy
(through Tunisia), exports and sales of piped gas have gradually increased to
reach 12.2 BCM in 1989; this figure is expected to increase to 16 BCM by 1995
following the expansion of the line (through the addition of compressing
facilities and the construction of another sealine between Tunisia and
Sicily); additional sales would go to Italy, Yugoslavia and some East European
countries, for which contracts are currently under negotiations. Algeria's
long-term projections also include sales through the TransMed II pipeline
which is planned through Morocco and Spain (crossing the Gibraltar strait); a
joint engineering company (OMEGAZ-Etudes) was recently formed by ENAGAS
(Spain), SNPP (Morocco), SONATRACH (Algeria), Gaz de France and Ruhrgas
(Germany) to prepare the detailed engineering of this project, and sales
contract are currently under negotiations with potential customers (Morocco,
Spain, --and possibly Portugal--in the first phase; and France and Germany in
the second phase). In connection with this work, the Bank is currently
financing an in-depth study of Morocco's gas market under the ESMAP program.
Forecarts assume that incremental sales through this new pipeline would start
in 1995, gradually building up to 8.3 BCM by 2000; although there is obviously



- 12 -
some uncertainty regarding the construction of the TransHed II pipeline, one
can safely assume, however, that most of the corresponding sales would be made
through alternative means (eg. through building of additional LNG capacity, or
a further expansion of Transmed I) if its construction is foregone.
1.26 Concerning export prices for crude oil, Algeria followed OPEC's fixed
price policy prior to 1986. After the 1986 oil price collapse and the abandon
of official prices by OPEC, Algeria's policy has been to sell crude oil as
well as refined petroleum products, condensates and LPGs at the going market
prices.  Algeria's policy with respect _o export prices for natural gas has
been evolving over time. In recent years an increasingly competitive market
has developed in North America and Western Europe. On both continents there
are now multiple suppliers with large reserves serving a nearly fully integra-
ted gas distribution network. Under these market conditions, Algeria's
initial reluctance to follow downward movements in international gas prices
led to a loss of markets and significant underutilization of its LNG export
capacity (para. 1.24). Starting in 1987, Algeria switched to a more
aggressive gas marketing policy, negotiating new contracts with former US
customers (such as Distrigas of Boston), and arranging spot LNG sales with new
international buyers (e.g. in the UK, Japan and Southern Europe). Algeria's
new flexibility was evidenced by the agreement reached after several years of
negotiations with its main customer Gaz de France in January 1989, which
linked the LNG price to a basket of 8 crudes (instead of the previous netback
formula). More recently, an agreement was reached with Shell and Columbia Gas
(US) to revive LNG shipments through the (previously mothballed) Cove Point
terminal, on the US eastern shore.

1.27 Production, processing, transport and distribution of energy (including
uranium and coal) are the responsibility of a number of state-owned
enterprises, most of which fall under the general supervision of the Ministry
of Mines and Industries (MMI). Until the early 1980s, vi:tually all oil, gas
and electricity-related activities were centralized in two public enterprises
-- SONATRACH (Societ6 Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le
Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures) and
SONELGAZ (Soci6t6 nationale de l'Electricitd et du Gaz). In 1982, SONATRACH
was reorganized and split into a number of specialized enterprises (see
para. 1.28). Until recently, MMI was closely involved in all matters
concerning the management of the sector through the day-to-day control of the
operations of all (public) sector entities; the liberalization of the economy
and the drive toward greater enterprise autonomy has, however, led the
government to reassess the role of NMI vis-a-vis sector enterprises, most
particularly SONATRACH. Such role is now to emphasize: (i) policy
formulation; (ii) overall sector planning and coordination; and (iii)
regulatory monitoring and enforcement for all petroleum activities.

1.28  Following SONATRAC'I's restructuring in 1982 and its concentration on
upstream oil and gas activities and hydrocarbon exports, a new enterprise,
Entreprise Nationale de Commercialisation et de Distribution de Produits
Petroliers (NAFTAL), was created to manage oil refining and domestic distribu-
tion of petroleum products, including LPGs. Eight new companies were created
for special-purpose petroleum activities including: geophysical work,
drilling and petroleum engineering. Three enterprises were formed for civil
works and pipeline construction. Three enterprises were created to produce
fertilizers, petrochemicals, plastics and rubber. Besides, another entity was
formed for maritire transport of hydrocarbon and chemical products. In 1987,
NAFTAL's refining activities were spun off to form a new enterprise:
Entreprise nationale de raffinage des produits petroliers (NAFTEC). Synopsis
of the sector's major public enterprises (outside of SONATRACi) are included
in Annex 1.11. Details on SONATRACH's organization, activities, and finances
are included in Chapter II.
1.29 Although the 1982 restructuring resolved certain management problems
resulting from SONATRACH's excessive size, it has not resulted in significant
improvements in the efficiency of most sector enterprises. Petroleum service
enterprises, in particular, have suffered from lack of competit.on, low
salaries, technological obsolescence, import restrictions, overstaffing and
dependence on SOliATRACH as sole customer. It is expected that these
constraints will be gradually lifted as a result of recent policy changes:
specifically, increasingly active foreign cil companies are now giver the
possibility to use foreign contractors; SONATRACH has become more cost-
conscious as a result of enterprise autonomy and intends to strictly monitor
the performance of its contractors while considering spinning off some of its
own service activities (starting with logistical support in the oil bases);
forthcoming changes in national salary regulations are expected to enable
enterprises to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial staff;
and local service enterprises will be able to form joint-ventures with foreign
partners; a first such joint-venture for well workover services was recently
formed between SONATRACH and CFP (Total). Given these changes, a global
reflection on the future of the petroleum service sector in Algeria (and its
opening up to the private sector--both local and foreign) is necessary, and
funding is provided under the proposed loan for the carrying out of a
corrosponding study by international consultants. The study will be managed
by the Fonds de Participation Mines Hydrocarbures Hydraulicue, one of the
eight Government holding companies with major shares in the subsector, which
has an obvious and direct interest in promoting the future restructuring of
the subsector.

1.30 The Government's overall objective in the energy sector is to manage the
country's energy resources so as to achieve a reconciliation between the need,
on the one hand, to satisfy domestic energy demand over the medium and long
term and the desire, on the other hand, to maximize revenues from export sales
in order to finance ec nomic development.
1.31 On the domestic front, the Government's main objectives are:
to ensure that electricity, natural gas and petroleum products are
reliably available wherever they are needed;
to replace domestic consumption of petroleum products with natural
gas or LPG wherever possible, in order to maximize the exportable
surplus of crude oil and products;
to encourage direct use of natural gas by limiting electricity
consumption to non-substitutabl-e uses and off-peak thermal
applications that improve the economics of electricity genera-
tion; and
to conserve national oil and gas resources by promoting efficient
use of energy.

1.32 Within the context of its overall energy policy, the Government's
strategy in the petroleum sector aims at maximizing revenues from the export
of hydrocarbons subject to (i) technical criteria regarding optimal reserves
recovery and (ii) the satisfaction of the domestic market. To this end, the
Government plans to continue its long-term program to develop the extraction
of high value gas liquids while pursuing an aggressive natural gas marketing
policy in order to fully utilize its LNG facilities; in parallel it plans to
maximize crude oil production through the systematic undertaking of enhanced
(secondary and tertiary) recovery schemes on most fields when reservoir
conditions warrant it.
1.33 Concerning exploration, the Government's ultimate objective is to ensure
a replacement of the oil and gas reserves produced each year; this is most
critical for crude oil for which the reserves to production ratio has steadily
decreased (to 22 years by end-1988, vs. 60 years for gas) as a result of the
absence of significant discoveries over the last 25 years; this long-term
objective is not unrealistic as a large proportion of Algeria's prospective
areas remain un- (or under-) explored (witness the exploration drilling
density of 0.6 wells per thousand sq.km compared to 50 wells in North America
and 4.5 in Western Europe). The Government has now realized that the required
level and depth of the exploration efforts required to achieve that objective



- 15 -
were beyond SONATRACH's capacity and has effected a major shift in its
exploration policy which now emphasizes:
(i)   attracting foreign oil companies' capital and expertise through
the adoption of an appropriate legal and contractual framework
(para. 1.6); and
(ii) refocusing SONATRACH's exploration efforts towards areas where its
effectiveness (or knowledge) is greatest, or where foreign
companies will not or cannot go; in addition, it will carry out
under the project an intensive program of basin studies and
reconnaissance work to serve as the technical basis for the
promotion of potential acreage to the oil industry.
SONATRACH's medium-term investment program (which is presented in chapter II)
reflects these priorities; in the long-run, SONATRACH plans to put in place a
sophisticated hydrocarbon development optimization model which will ensure
that investment planning is based on sound financial and economic criteria.
Specialized assistance for the development and installation of this model is
included in the project (see chapter III).
H. Prlort Issues fAnd Bank Role
Main Sectoral Is3ue8
1.34 The Government's overall strategy and objectives for the energy sector
in general, and more specifically for the petroleum sector, are appropriate.
There is a question, however, as to whether some of the current policies
implemented in the sector are fully conducive to achieving these objectives.
The main policy issues which have been identified during project preparation
can be categorized under three main headings: (i) efficiency of petroleum
exploration and productiou operations; (ii) gas utilization; and (iii) demand
management.
1.35 Efficiency of Petroleum Exploration and Production Operations. Future
improvements in sector efficiency are going to be largely dependent on the
implementation of policies designed to enhance competition and permit access
to modern technology and private capital. The legal and contractual framework
for exaloration, in particular, needs to provide sufficient incentives for the
private sector to bring into the country risk capital as well technological
and managerial expertise; in addition, a wider involvement of the private
sector is needed in order to provide at the very least a reference for
assessing the performance of state enterprises, and in selected subsectors
(e.g. services), direct competition. As already mentioned, the issuance of
the new Petroleum Law in 1988 has already led to the signing of a sizeable
number of exploration contracts with foreign oil companies (para. 1.7);
problems remain in two areas, however: first, there is a need to better
organize and structure the promotion process while improving both the form and
the substance of the current framework; second, the country's overall
exploration strategy requires further elaboration (in terms of long-term



- 16 -
objectives, regional priorities, respective roles of SONATRACMi and the private
sector, etc.).
1.36 Changes in the legal framework are also needed to accelerate the
development of crude oil reserves by allowing foreign companies to invest in
enhanced oil recovery in fields currently being produced by SONATRACH. The
current declining trend in oil production over the next 8-10 years (see
para. 1.10) is not likely to change significantly even in case of major
discoveries resulting from recently renewed exploration efforts, given the
time required for any new production to come on stream. However, this decline
could be stopped or at least slowed down significantly by an aggressive
program of secondary and tertiary oil recovery which recent Bank studies show
could increase total oil recovery by up to 450 million tons (an increment of
about 15 million tons p.a. by 2000). Such program will require the
mobilization of very large financial resources (up to US$22 billion) as well
as a level of technological expertise and project management capabilities
which SONATRACH on its own cannot provide. Although a major step in this
direction has recently been taken with the signing of the joint-venture
agreement with CFP on the Hamra condensate field (para. 1.8), negotiations
were complicated by the rigidity of the current law; changes to the law itself
are thus required for such ventures to be replicated on a larger scale (the
Government is currenitly finalizing a draft legislation for submission to the
next Parliamentary session).
1.37 Another way to improve efficiency in the sector is through restructuring
of existing state-owned enterprises; although a systematic analysis of the
efficiency of these enterprises, including SONATRACH, is difficult to make in
the absence of reliable cost accounting systems, there is at least episodic
evidence that these enterprises' costs are not in line with international
norms. Recent policy changes may obviate some of the constraints previously
faced by these enterprises, e.g. low salaries, technological obsolescence,
import restrictions, overstaffing and lack of competition. However, the
Government needs to integrate recent actions within the framework of a
coordinated restructuring strategy to improve the efficiency of state-owned
petroleum enterprises. Human resources development is also key to future
efficiency improvements in the sector, in order to overcome the technological
lag which resulted from years of isolation from the rest of the oil industry,
and the lack of sufficient emphasis, in the past, on training in management
and finance.
1.38 Gas Policy. Gas is at the crux of Algeria's energy sector as gas and
gas liquids together provide 76% of exports receipts and account for 57% of
domestic energy consumption. Although inappropriate gas marketing and pricing
strategies, combined with a slower than expected growth of the international
gas market, had resulted in the loss of zigpificant markets in the late 1970s
and early 1980s and the subsequent underutilization of LNG capacity
(para. 1.24), the shift to a more aggressive export marketing strategy since
1988 is expected to lead to increased participation in the European and US
markets in the next decade. There is a need, however, to place these efforts
to develop export markets for piped natural gas and LNG within the framework
of an overall gas development and utilization strategy, based on an economic



- 17 -
valuation of gas for different - , taking into account current estimates of
reserves, supply and demand. Thi- is particularly needed at a time when
consideration is been given to several gas-based projects for the production
of methanol, aluminum etc. A major issue is that the timing for commissioning
of such projects might correspond to the period when gas exports are also
scheduled to be boosted significantly by the opening of new pipelines to
Europe and the expansion of LNG capacity (paras. 1.24 and 1.25), raising the
question of possible long-term supply constraints, in light of current
reserves estimates.
1.39 Demand Management. As already mentioned (para. 1.14), Algeria's per
capita energy consumption is high as is its ratio of energy demand growth to
GDP, as a result of (i) historically low energy prices, and (ii) poor energy
efficiency in the (largely state-owned) industrial sector. A major step
towards addressing the former issue has already been taken, with the recent
price increases enacted for most energy products and the Government's declared
commitment to bring prices up to economic cost for products which remain
partially subsidized (para. 1.18). Tackling the second issue will require
more time as the design of an intogratec energy conservation policy is a
complicated task in any country, particularly in a socialist economy in
transition like that of Algeria where many constraints prevent an automatic
response to price signals at the enterprise level. There is therefore a need
to design an approach which would combine price adjustments with direct
actions at the firm level.
Bsnk's Role and Lending Stategy
1.40 The Bank's strategy for assistance to Algeria focusses on supporting the
country's economic reform program and the Government's drive towards improved
resource allocation and productivity. The Bank is implementing this strategy
through adjustment lending (an enterprise and financial sector adjustment loan
was recently approved and a fiscal and trade adjustment loan is currently
being prepared) and investment operations targeted at enhancing the efficiency
of productive sectors and the delivery of social and public services. Bank
involvement in the petroleum sector is consonant with this strategy in view of
the sector's predominant role in the economy as revenue generator and catalyst
for industrial development. Specifically, the Bank's intervention in the
sector aims at: (i) addressing key sector issues (see above), particularly as
they relate to other sectors where major reforms are underway and where Bank
operations are considered (e.g. energy-intensive industries); (ii) mobilizing
financing for the sizeable foreign currency requirements of the sector,
through direct funding and co-financing arrangements; and (iii) providing
catalytic support for increased involvement by the international petroleum
industry in developing Algeria's substantial hydrocarbon potential.
1.41 Given the complexity and sensitivity of the petroleum sector in Algeria,
the Government and the Bank have agreed on a gradual but incremental strategy
for Bank involvement. This first project is therefore designed, as an initial
step, to address a selected number of key issues, while contributing to a
modest extent to the mobilization of SONATRACH's financing requirements.
Specifically, the issues of sector development strategy ant efficiency



- 18 -
(including the private sector's role) and human resource development  vill be
addressed under the project through (i) technical and legal/contractual
assistance designed to help foster investment by foreign oil companies; (ii) a
study of the restructuring of the petroleum services subsector; (iii) the
strengthening of SONATRACH's planning capability and financial systems and the
training of its financial/managerial staff; and (iv) the strengthening of its
technical capabilities in the ar,.as of enhanced oil recovery and drilling.  In
this connection, the Bank's independent dialogue with international petroleum
companies has provided valuable inputs into the designing of the project's
technical assistance component, and into the technical support already
provided to SONATRACH during project preparation. The issue of gas
utilization will be addressed, through the development, under the project, of
a computerized model for the optimization of long-term hydrocarbons
development. Energy Pricing issues have been addressed during project
preparation, resulting in the substantial price increases referred to above.
Environmental issues will also be addressed under the project; in particular,
it will help SONATRACH implement a comprehensive Environmental Plan of Action
related to its drilling and production operations, which has been prepared on
the basis of an initial re-iew carried out by the Bank during appraisal.
SONATRACH has also agreed under the loan to discuss every year with the Bank
its medium-term investment program and future finances, which will provide an
opportunity for the Bank to contribute to the des1gn of the sector's
investment priorities and overall strategy.
1.42 Subsequent operations would build upon and extend the policy focus of
the current project. To this end, they would concentrate on further improving
the structure of domestic hydrocarbons pricing (an issue which is also
addressed jointly by the Fund and the Bank in the context of their overall
macroeconomic dialogue), as well as rationalizing gas utilization and
promoting energy conservation. They will also follow up on the restructuring
of SONATRACH and other sector enterprises, and hopefully provide for direct
private sector involvement in order to maximize the Bank's catalytic role;
this will be facilitated by expected changes in the legal/contractual
framework designed to permit foreign investment in enhanced recovery projects,
which have been prepared with the Bank's assistance. Finally, the Bank would
promote future regional energy projects, such as the planned gas pipeline
between Algeria, Morocco and Spain which may prove critical for the whole
region's energy future; in this connection, the Bank is already providing
assistance to Morocco, under the ESMAP program, for a study of its future gas
needs.

I. THE BORROWER
Mdkavound and ScR= of AsUz
2.1         SONATRACH (Societ6 Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le
Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures),
Algeria's national oil company, was created in 1963 with initial
responsibility for transportation and marketing of hydrocarbons; these areas
of activities were widened in 1966 to enco X-ass petroleum exploration,
production and transformation; following the take over of most foreign
companies' distribution and production activities in 1968 and 1971
respectively, SONATRACH became one of the main instruments of the Government's
industrialization policy, expanding rapidly into downstream activities,
including gas liquefaction, refining and petrochemicals. Through the early
1980s, SONATRACH enjoyed a quasi monopoly on the whole spectrum of petroleum
and related activities, from exploration to petrochemicals production, and was
by far the largest Algerian enterprise, with a staff of about 100,000.
2.2         The increasing difficulties associated with the management of this
vertically and hotizontally integrated giant concern led to the Government's
decision in 1982 to divide it into 18 specialized enterprises (para. 1.28).
The new SONATRACH, for its part, is essentially involved in:
(i)   petroleum exploration, and updating of the country's knowledge of
i.s petroleum potential;
(ii)   oil and gas development and production, including gas liquids
extraction;
(iii)   inland oil and gas transportation through pipelines;
(iv)   production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG); and
(v)   export of all hydrocarbons (inclucing refined petroleum products).
SONATRACH had enjoytd until recent reforms a quasi monopoly on all these
activities, having accounted for most of the country's exploration investments
over the last 10 years (largely due to previous restrictive exploration
policies; see para. 1.6), and for all of the production and sale of crude
oil,!/ gas liquids, natural gas and LNG, which provided '. with gross revenues
of US$15 billion equivalent in 1990.  In addition, Sj,`ATRACH holds interests
in Anadarko, a US-based oil company, and in Panhandle, a US-based LNG company.

Prwent Organizitlon
2.3    SONATRACH is currently organized as a state-owned enterprise (Societe
Nationale), and is headed by a General Manager, to whom report 6 Deputy
General Managers; they, in turn oversee 11 Technical Divisions and 8 Central
(staff) departments (see current organization chart in Annex 2.1). Operational
Management is reasonably decentralized, both at the level of the Technical
Divisions, which have their own finance, personnel and legal functions, and at
the regional level for day-to-day production operations (with major bases in
Hassi Messaoud for oil and Hassi R'Mel for gas); until recently, however, a
number of operational decisions, most notably relating to procurement, had
remained centralized, resulting in unnecessary delays and inefficiencies.
Furthermore, the basic strategic decisions and investnent plans were macse by,
or under close scrutiny of, MMI, which decreased the flexibility of the
enterprise and caused additional inefficiencies. This situation has changed
markedly over the last twelve months as MMI has removed itself gradually from
the day-to-day management of the company in anticipation of forthcoming
organizational changes (see para. 2.5). As is to be expected given the
strategic nature of SONATRACH and its role in the country's economy, major
decisions regarding, inter alia, the undertaking of large investments, export
strategy and new joint-ventures still have to be cleared by the Government.
2.4    In the context of increasing exploration and production costs (see
para. 2.15), rapid technological developments and fluctuating oil prices,
SONATRACH needs to improve its flexibility and capability in the areas of
strategic management, cost accounting, economic analysis, international
marketing and procurement. Continued growth in Algeria's hydrocarbon exports
over the next decade, and its reduced vulnerability to fluctuations in world
oil prices will largely depend in SONATRACH's success in optimizing its
investments and operations and in luring joint venture partners. This calls
for a systematic process of institutional development, with emphasis on
increased flexibility, integration of different technical disciplines in
decision making process and accountability at various levels of the
organization.
Proposed OmanMigonal  Changes
2.5    In light of the above and in the context of the on-going reform and the
drive towards public enterprise autonomy, SONATRACH is planning a major
reorganization which would result in a further decentralization of its
activities as part of its forthcoming autonomization. Specifically, it would
be restructured into five separate affiliates (each established as an
autonomous public enterprise, a.k.a. EPE), responsible respectively for (i)
international operations, (ii) exploration/production, (iii) gas liquefaction,
(iv) transport, and (v) refining, under the umbrella of a holding management
which would design the Group's overall strategy and financing and coordinate
the affiliates' operations. The specifics of the new management systems,
interaffiliate and affiliate-holding relations and other aspects related to
the practical implementation of this plan are to be refined in the coming
I/     NAFTEC wvoud tius reener the SONATIACH goup.



- 21 -
months. This decentralized organization is expected to lead to greater
financial autonomy and efficiency in SONATRACHs own operations; it will also
promote competition and efficiency in the rest of the sector as SONATPuACH
intends to increase its use of both local and foreign private subcontractors
in order to minimize its costs (see para. 1.29).
2.6    The success of the new organization in delegating decision making,
increasing specialisation and therefore promoting an efficient and responsive
structure, will largely depend on effective implementation and on the
availability of trained personnel (particularly middle managers) who will have
to assume greater responsibilit-7 and face greater accountability. To support
development of human resources  the proposed project includes management and
technical training programs (see para. 2.9).
2.7    Internal task forces have been set up to carry out an initial
reflection on related issues and to identify the need for external assistance
in implementing the new organization, particularly regarding human resource
management, financial and managerial systems and affiliate-holding relations.
The detailed scope of such assistance, for which funds are being provided
under the project, will be determined upon completion of the work of the task
forces, expected by the end of 1991.
Sffina gnd Trmninq1
2.8   As of December 31, 1988, SONATRACH's staff numbered 28,158 (of whom
5,875 were professionals), down from 39,376 in 1983. SONATRACH's workers and
technical supervisory staff are probably the most skilled in Algeria as a
result of the company's strong emphasis on technical training since its
creation, which aimed at eliminating the sector's dependence on foreign
personnel: an average of about US$13 million per year has been spent on
training over the last few years; most training was held abroad in the early
yearsi and, since the late 1970s, mostly in the compar.y's own training
centers. In spite of the rigidity of the remuneration system imposed for many
years on all public enterprises by the public sector labor legislation (SGT)
and of !-he difficult working conditions in the oil fields (in which about two
thirds of the staff work), SONATRACH's benefits (including medical, childcare,
housing finance, vacation camps, etc.) have remained the best in the country
ard, as a result, turnover has been low in recent years (4.5X in 1988).
2.9    SONATRACH's personnel situation had deteriorated markedly in the late
197Qs and early 1980s: (i) low salaries and the lack of appropriate incentives
for higher-level staff resulted in the loss of a number of senior staff and
low productivity at most echelons; (ii) SONATRACH's relative isolation from
the rest of the oil industrv since the late 1970s resulted in areas of
technological backwardness (e.g. in data processing, geology and geophysics);
and (iii) training in management and finance had been somewhat neglected,
resulting in the absence of a strong cadre of middle managers. Recent policy
changes, and in particular the greater flexibility now given SONATRACH to send

staff abroad for training, conferences, etc., as well as the recent
elimination of the SOT will enable the company to put in place a more flexible
and performance-driven remuneration system should enhance the overall
productivity of the company. The Bank would contribute to that endeavour
under the proposed project by: (i) financing technical and managerial training
(including attendance to stainars and conferences, purchase of specialized
material, etc.) in the areas of exploraUon, drilling supervision and
production; (ii) modernizing the company's data processing capabilities in
those same areas; (iii) strengthening SONATRACH's two Management/Finance
Training Centers in Arzew and Oran (which are among the top institutions in
that field in Algeria, and serve not only the needs of SONATRACH but also of
other enterprises of the sector); and (iv) funding several full-time foreign
experts to reinforce, and carry out on the job training for, the staff of the
Exploration Division over a period of about two years (see para. 3.2).
Accounting. Audit and InsuranCe
2.10   Although SONATRACH inherited in 1971 the financial and information
systems developed by foreign companies for their Algerian operations, their
uniformization and the development of modern managerial and cost accounting
systems has been hampered by (i) the emphasis given until recently, as in all
Algerian enterprises, to production/technical versus financial considerations;
and (ii) the scarcity of financial expertise in thb country. These weaknesses
would be addressed by the project in two complementary ways: first in the
context of the consultants' assistance in the implementation of the company's
new organization (para. 2.7); and second, under the proposed external audit of
project accounts (see below).
z.11   Before the 1982 restructuring, SONATRACH had been able to build a
qualified internal audit function with the assistance of foreign auditing
firms comprising a cadre of about 30 fully-trained auditors which were
assigned, inter alia, to the audit of (i) major turnkey contracts, (ii)
petroleum service subsidiaries, and (iii) exploration/production joint-
ventures with oil companies. This group has since been significantly
depleted, however, as many staff moved to SONATRACH's spin-offs and other
enterprises outside the sector in need of scarce financial expertise. As a
result, the remaining group is limited to carrying out a few ad hoc audits
upon management's demand, instead of the systematic review of t.he company's
operations and systems; moreover, it currently reports to the Financial
Director, instead of the General Manager or, more appropriately, the
enterprise's Board of Directors when one is established. In anticipation of
its forthcoming autonomization, SONATRACH entered in the beginning of 1991
into a framework contract with an international financial management
consulting firm for assistance in improving its financial and management
information systems and in strengthening the company's internal audit
function; such program is currently in its diagnostic stage and financing
under the Bank loan of selected follow-up activities may be considered once a
detailed program is in place. The forthcoming reorganization will also be the
opportunity to  xaL4aJLy introduce the external audit of the company's annual
accounts, a procedure to which no Algerian enterprise has so far been



- 23 -
subjected.1  In this respect, agreement has been reached under the loan to
the effect that, starting in 1991, the project accounts (as well as the
Special Account and SOEs; see para 3.8) will be audited annually by
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The proposed audit will
be closely coordinated with the consultants' program for improvements of
SONATRACH's accounting and control systems at large (see above). It would be
clearly unrealistic to require a full and immediate complete external audit by
foreign auditors of SONATRACH's overall financial statements considering its
size, the current reorganization and the fact that the concept of audit itself
is relatively new in Algeria. For purposes of compliance with the Bank's
requirement for independant audit of the Borrower's annual financial
statements, the Bank would thus satisfy itself with the certification
("Commissariat aux Comptes"), starting with FYl991, of SONATRACH's accounts by
local accountants, which is now required by law for all algerian enterprises,
but falls short of a full-fledged external audit. The implementation of its
new organizational structure and the introduction of new financial systems
should permit SONATRACH to move to full-scale audits after a transition period
of two to threle years.
2.12   SONATRACH carries adequate insurance on its major facilities and
equipment both during construction and operation, against all major hazards
such as fire, explosion, etc. Insurance for transportation and delivery of
goods is regularly arranged.
Financil PerfonManc
2.13   Given SONATRACH's predominance in the sector and its role as the
Government's commercial arm and de facto fiscal agent, its finances are
obviously highly dependent on Government policies and actions regarding
particular petroleum taxation, domestic prices and rates of output. They are
also affected by other exogenous factors such as the international price of
hydrocarbons. Although its strategic decisions and investment plans have been
closely scrutinized by MMI, SONATRACH has enjoyed a reasonable degree of
financial autonomy, compared to most other national oil companies. In
particular: (i) it does not depend on Government direct funding for its
investments and is authorized to negotiate its own borrowings; (ii) the level
and structure of petroleum taxes has enabled it, so far, to self-finance a
sizeable proportion of its investments; and (iii) subject to the normal
budgetary process, the carrying out of its projects and day-to-day operations
has been relatively free of burdensome financial and administrative Government
controls which are so commonly imposed on other countries' national oil
companies.
2.14 ITaes levied on SONATRACH include two major components: (i) on the one
hand, royalty (in fact sales) taxes are assessed at the rate of 201 on total
actual sales revenues (excluding exports of refined products which are
purchased from NAFTEC, and on which the company receives in effect only a 1X
margin); and (ii) corporate income taxes are assessed at the rate of 85% on
production income and 501 on income from transportation and gas liquefaction

activities (less than 5% of total income). In 1990, corporate taxes and
royalties amounted to US$5.1 and US$2.3 billion respectively, representing 491
of SONATRACHs total sales revenues, and accounting for about 481 of total
Government revenues.
2.15   SONATRACH's financial pertormance over the last four years is
summarized below:

hi before interest.
The above table shows that the combination of several factors contributed to
the erosion of SONATRACH's export revenues and consequently its profits and
cash-flow thru 1989: (i) the sharp decline in international oil and gas prices
in 1986; (ii) starting from early eighties, declining crude oil volume
exports that was not totally off-set by gradually increasing refined and gas
products exports (LNG, LPG); and (iii) sizeable exchange losses in debt
repayments, (in 1987 and 1988) as a result of the DA depreciation. The trend
was reversed in 1990 thanks to the increase in oil prices that took place in
the latter part of that year. Aggregate cost figures provided by SONATRACH
show production costs (before depreciation, transport, and overhead) to have
increased from about US$1.07/Bbl in 1985 to US$1.32/Bbl in 1988 for crude oil
(primarily as a result of the increasing recourse to more expensive enhanced
recovery methods).
2.16   Despite the adverse exogenous factors which impacted its finances
between 1986 and 1989, SONATRACH generated a healthy cash-flow stream which
has enabled it to self-finance about 40% of investments over the last six
years; the remainder has been financed from borrowings, of which about 281
were in foreign currency (mostly export credits as SONATRACH has had
practically no access to capital markets since 1987). The changing breakdown
of investments since 1984 is clearly shown in the following table:

This decline in investment levels is due to the fact that in 1985 SONATRACH
entered a phase of consolidation of its activities following the completion of
the major projects (refineries, petrochemicals, LNG, etc.) undertaken during
the previous decade. The slowdown was seriously reinforced by the squeeze on
internal and external resources which followed the 1986 oil crisis.
2.17   SONATRACH's balance sheet is reasonably healthy (particularly in the
Algerian context where a large number of public enterprises show negative net
worth), as shown in the table below (detailed historical balance-sheets are
included in Annex 2.2, Attachment 7):

2.18   Due to the difficulties SONATRACH has encountered over the last several
years to mobilize commercial funding abroad, the average maturity of its L-T
debt is rather short : approximately 771 of it will be serviced before 1992.
The company has therefore set reentering foreign capital markets in a sizeable
way as one of its priorities, and the Bank's assistance in this respect is
expected to be critical (para. 4.1).V Two points need to be mentioned
regarding SONATRACH's current financial position: first, foreign debts are
carried at their original value in DA (however since its fixed assets have not
been revalued systematically over the years and they do not include any value

for oil reserves, the company's debt-equity ratio calculation is likely to be
on the conservative side); second, L-T assets include a sizeable amount
(US$1.9 billion equivalent) of receivables from spun-off enterprises inherited
from the 1982 restructuring; after 1982, SONATRACH has continued to repay the
loans that were contracted by its old affiliates and reflects a reciprocal
portion of the debt as receivables in its balance sheet. The treatment of
these receivables is currently being discussed with the Government in the
context of SONATRACH's and these enterprises' autonomization and is expected
to be decided during the upcoming months (it is expected that at least some of
these receivables will be written off against SONATRACH's debt to the
Government).IJ
SONATRACHs Invstment Proarsa
2.19   SONATRACH enters an ambitious phase of investments which will total
US$7.6 billion during 1991-95 (including work in progress from 1985-90 plan),
compared to US$6.04 billion during 1985-89, (a 26X increase). A summary of
SONATRACH's investment program is shown below, (details are shown in Annex

2.20  SONATRACH's medium-term investment program shows a rapid increase in
the areas of crude, gas, and liquids production (mainly secondary and tertiary
recovery programs), reflecting SONATRACH's preoccupation with rapid yielding
productive investments. The company's axploration budget is expected to
average about $200 million per year, including 184 wells. Crue oil
develoDment and Droduction investments consist mostly of well workovers (341)
and secondary recovery programs (gas and water injection) in the Hassi
Kessaoud, Gassi Touil, Amassak, Oued Noumer and Rhourde el Baguel fields, and
a tertiary recovery pilot project in Zarzaitine.

- 27 -
2.21   The most important part of SONATRACH's investment plan, however, is in
gas and gas liquids develoRment/oroduction (44X of total investments). The
Plan includes:
(i)  Gas and LPG recovery projects in the South East of the Hassi-
Messaoud field, in Rourde Nouss, Stah, Hamra, Alrar West and
Tiguentourine and transportation of gas to Hassi R'Mel for
reinjection (engineering studies and drilling projects are
scheduled to be completed in 1991 and, start of the construction
of processing units is planned in 1992). The impact of these
programs on production is expected by 1997-1998.
(ii) Revamping of existing installations.
(iii) Development of the In Salah field which is programmed to start
towards the end of the 5-year investment plan (1994).
2.22   SONATRACH's transportation budget includes:
(i)  Work in Progress including replacement of the North part of 34"
oleoduc between Hamra & Skikda, and a third gas line between
Hassi R'Mel and Arzew, which is expected to be completed in 1991.
(ii) Revamping of two gas lines to feed LNG production units in Arzew
and Skikda (from Hassi R'Mel), scheduled for 1991.
(iii) A 900 km 20-30" LPG pipeline between Alrar and Hassi R'Mel, for
which engineering studies are under way.
(iv) Compression stations to increase the capacity of Transmed (to
Italy) which are planned for 1993.
(v)  Diverse studies on future gas pipelines.
2.23   SONATRACH's investment Rrogram for LNG aims at renovating the existing
plants to restore capacity and expar.d it by 25X, a crucial factor to attain
the forecasted LNG export levels (see para. 1.24). Investments in LPG
extraction include the revamping of existing installations, and capacity
extension (3mt) at Arzew's "Jumbo" processing plant. Other inves;ments
include the expansion of management training centers and of SONATRACH's
headquarters. SONATRACH's overall medium-term investment program would be
reviewed jointly with the Bank on an annual basis (para. 2.27).

P/ USS figures are presented using current mid-year exchange rate projections.

_/ Foreign debt valued at prevailing exchange rate.
2.25   The above figures show that SONATRACH's financial situation would
improve greatly over the next five years, mainly due to:
(i)    average yearly volume export increases for LNG, LPG, Condensates
and Natural Gas. (see Annex 2.2, Attachment 2);
(ii)   the expected depreciation of the Algerian Dinar by approximately
59% against the US dollar between 1991 and 1995. (see Annex
2.2, Attachment 1), which favors SONATRACH whose revenues are
for a large part in foreign currency; and
(iii) the expected increase in international hydrocarbon prices (about
1.5% p.a. on average in nominal terms).V
Revenues are forecast to grow from US$9.7 billion in 1991 to US$12.8 billion
in 1995, an average yearly increase of 5X. Net income is forecast to increase
from US$800 million in 1989, to US$1.19 billion in 1995 SONATRACH's five-year
investment plan which has a 50X foreign component will require continued heavy
borrowings, but the strength of its internal cash generation will allow
SONATRACH to reach a very comfortable 58:42 debt equity ratio and to self-
finance all of its investments by 1995. The access to international financial
markets will be crucial for SONATRACH, due to the high percentage foreign
component of its investment program which would mainly be financed through
In acomMc  Oi eabnWs aft

international borrowing. Its current ratio is expected to reach a solid 3.5
in 1995 from its low of 1.7 in 1989.
SensltMft of Financial Prolicons
2.26   Sensitivity analyses were carried out for several key parameters as
follows:
(i) 5X decrease in production of oil and gas;
(ii) slower depreciation of the DA (10 p.a. between 1990 and 1995);
(iii) increase in domestic crude oil prices (up to border prices);
(iv) 20X decrease in crude oil and gas export prices.
Key financial ratios based on these scenarios are presented in Annex 2.2,
Attachment 7. The results show that none of the above changes would have a
major impact on SONATRACH's financial viability-with some improvement observed
in SONATRACH's revenues and cash flow as a result of scenario (iii). All
major ratios would remain within acceptable limits. We can therefore conclude
that SONATRACH should be able to sustain, and most probably improve, its
financial situation over the next five years; this assumes of course that
SONATRACH's taxation regime will not be changed in any substantial way.
Financial Covenants
2.27 In order to ensure that its financial performance will remain
satisfactory, the following agreements have been reached with SONATRACH during
negotiations: (i) that it will review jointly with the Bank, by June 30 of
each year, its financial performance for the previous year as well as its
investment plan and related medium-term financial forecasts for the next five
years; and (ii) that it will keep its debt-equity ratio below 75:25 in 1991
and 1992, 70:30 in 1993 and 66:34 thereafter, and a minimum debt service
coverage ratio of 1.3 in 1991 and 1.5 from 1992 onwards; if it cannot meet
these ratios in any year, SONATRACH would submit to the Bank, within 60 days
of said review and at the latest by August 31, a program of measures
acceptable to the Bank, aimed at bringing them back to said levels (the above
figures for debt-equity and debt service coverage ratios are included in a
sipplemental letter to the loan agreement)

Ill. THE PROJECT
Prolect Oblectives
3.1         The project's primary objectives are to: (i) help the Government
and SONATRACH in their efforts to attract investments in exploration and
development by foreign oil companies; (ii) help SONATRACH improve the
efficiency of drilling operations, the high cost of which has proved to be a
major financial drain on the company's budget;' (iii) help SONATRACH optimize
the production of its oil fields through enhanced oil recovery schemes; and
(iv) address environmental problems related to drilling and production
activities. All these will lead to very substantial and rapid foreign
earnings/savings, and thus contribute to alleviate the country's severe
balance of payments difficulties. Moreover, the Bank's involvement will help
SONATRACH mobilize incremental external funds through co-financing
arrangements with Eximbank of Japan.
ProleCt Desciption
3.2         The project includes four main components: (i) assistance to the
promotion of exploration acreage to foreign oil companies; (ii) technical
assistance and training for drilling supervision; (iii) studies and
investments in selected enhanced oil recovery projects; and (iv) other
technical assistance and training.
(a)   Exploration Promotion Assistance.  This component consists, first,
of the carrying out of comprehensive basin studies in selected
priority areas (starting with the Ilizi, Ahnet, Constantine and
Chelif basins); these studies will include the compilation and
integration of all existing geological, geochemical, geophysical
and well data in each area, with a view to permit a new
interpretation of its petroleum potential and the identification
of new exploration leads which could prove attractive to oil
companies. Second, it includes the development and setting up of
a modern, computerized, exnloration data base; given the extremely
large amount of data acquired over the years and the need for both
foreign oil companies and SONATRACH to access them quickly and
efficiently in order to prepare their exploration plans, the
acquisition of such a tool is an immediate priority. Thirdly,
technical assistance will be provided to SONATRACH's Exploration
Division in the form of geophysical and geological computerized
workstations as well as the services of full-time foreign experts
for a period of up to 3 years (about 125 man-months). Finally,
consulting services will be provided to assist SONATRACH in
oromotional activities (organization of seminars and/or contacts
1/    07twng eypenduurme In 1989 amounted to about US$350 mion.

with oil companies, etc.) and in cntract ReLotiations with oil
companies.
(b)   Technical Assistance and Training in Drilling Supervision.  This
component aims at strengthening SONATRACH's drilling supervisory
capabilities which have remained weak since SONATRACH's drilling
operations were spun off (to form ENTP) in 1982. It includes:
(i) an extensive T.A. and on-the-job training package to be
provided by a foreign oil company (Total/CFP of France) over a 3-
year period in order to train about 40 drilling supervisors; and
(ii) the acquisition of a drilling simulator and related
assistance (including upgrading of the Drilling Division's data
processing facilities).
(c)   Enhanced Oil Recovery and Gas Liguids Extraction.  This component
consists of: (i) two subprojects designed to enhance the recovery
of crude oil in the Hesdar/Rhourde-El-Bagumel field (through
injection of miscible gas at a rate of 2.4 MM m3/day in order to
increase ultimate oil recovery by about 13X, i.e. 130 million
barrels), and in the massak field (through water injection at a
rate of 3,500 m3/day in order to increase oil recovery by about
3OX, i.e. about 19 million barrels)--in both cases investments
include the drilling of injection wells as well as the acquisition
of surface facilities (compressors, generators, pipes, etc.);
(ii) detailed feasibility studies and engineering/supervision of a
tertiary recovery pilot project through the injection of CO2 in
the Zarzaaitn field; and (iii) strengthening of SONATRACH's
Production Division's data processing facilities.
(d)   Other Training and Technical Assistance.  This component includes:
(i) studies, technical assistance and training related to the
implementation of SONATRACH's Environmental Action Plan (see para.
3.10 below); (ii) the development of a computerized L-T
hydrocarbons development optimization model (about 75 man-months);
(iii) the strengthening of SONATRACH's Management and Finance
Training Centers in Arzew and Algiers as well as technical and
managerial training in the area of exploration, production,
drilling and administration/finance; (iv) consultant studies and
services related to the implementation of SONATRACH's new
organization (paras. 2.7 and 2.11); (v) specialized documentation;
and (vi) an in-depth study of the petroleum services subsector
(para. 1.29).
MOMt ImO0MMnton
3.3         SONATRACH's Exploration, Production and Drilling Divisions, as
well as its Organization, Planning, and Human Resources Departments and the
Research Center (CRD) will be primarily responsible for implementing their
respective components. Coordination vis-&-vis the Bank will be provided by
SONATRACH's Finance Department. Implementation arrangements for the study of



- 32 -
the petroleum services subsector are recorded in a supplemental letter between
the Fonds de Participation Mines Hydrocarbures Hvdraulique and the Bank.
Foreign suppliers/contractors and consultants will carry out most components
of the project with the exception of civil works and drilling for the
secondary oil recovery subprojects, which will be undertaken by local
contractors under reserved procurement and local competitive bidding
respectively; this arrangement is considered acceptable as it is consistent
with considerations of economy and efficiency (see para. 3.7). The project
would be implemented over a four-year period, starting in mid 1991 (a detailed
Implementation Schedule is shown in Annex 3.3). Project preparation is well
underway for the two main physical components of the project, i.e. the Mesdar
and Amassak subprojects: in both cases, bidding documents for surface
facilities have already been issued, following clearance by the Bank, and bids
are currently being evaluated; contract signature is expected before June 30,
1991. The procurement process is also well advanced for a number of other key
project components (see para. 3.7).

The base cost estimates are expressed in 1991 prices. Physical contingencies
were calculated at the rate of 10%. Price contingencies were based on
foreign inflation rates of 9.0% in 1991, 1.1% in 1992, 0% in 1993, 1.6X in
1994 and 3.8% in 1995, and local inflation rates of 30% in 1991, 18.8% in
1992, 11.7% in 1993, 10.3% in 1994, and 10.8% in 1995. These costs also
assume local currency depreciation of 59.5% in 1991 and 25.4% in 1992.

3.6        The proposed IBRD loan of US$100 million will cover 42X of the
project total cost and 581 of its foreign cost (respectively 41X and 58Z if
IDC is excluded). It will finance the foreign exchange cost of: (i) three
basin studies; (ii) surface facilities for the Mesdar and Amassak subprojects;
(iii) data processing equipment for the CRD and the Production and Drilling
Divisions; (iv) the drilling simulator; (v) training; (vi) selected studies
and negotiations/promotion assistance; and (vii) IDCG. The funds (US$0.5
million) allocated to the study of the petroleum services subsector
(para. 3.3) will be onlent by SONATRACH to the Fonds de Particination on the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan. Other external source of funds
are (i) a grant made by the French Government of about US$7 million equivalent
to finance the drilling, training and T.A. package, and (ii) a proposed untied
loan from Eximbank of Japan of about US$76.8 million equivalenr. The latter
is expected to be finalized shortly after the Bank loan and will be
administered by the Bank under standard co-financing arrangements; maturity
and grace period will be the same as fir the Bank loan; interest rate will be
that normally charged by Eximbank (currently 7.7X p.a.) Details on the
respective allocation of funds for the Bank and Eximbank loans are shown in
Annex 3.1. Most of the project local cost will be covered by domestic loans
(412) and SONATRACH's internal funds (40X).
3.7        All goods and services financed by the Bank under the project will
be procured according to Bank guidelines using ICB, LIB (for some contracts
for specialized goods and services below US$ 500,000), or direct procurement
in case of goods or services of a proprietary nature. Documentation for Bank-
financed contracts ovir US$ 500,000 will be subject to prior review by the
Bank. Although civil works and drilling will be contracted to local

Dibursembnt and Reactve Financing
3.8         The proposed loan will cover up to 100X of eligible foreign
expenditures for Bank-financed components. A Special Account of US$ 7.0
million (equivalent to about 4 months of loan disbursements) will be
established in foreign currency by SONATRACH in a local commercial bank. The
disbursement schedule for the loan is shown in Schedule B of the Memorandum of
the President, and is consistent with the Bank's standard profile for Algeria
taking into account the advanced procurement status of some key components
(para. 3.3). Withdrawal applications will be fully documented except for
expenditures under contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent that will be
made against certified Statement of Expenditures (SOE). Supporting
documentation would be retairsd by SONATRACH for at least one year after
receipt by the Bank of the Audit Report for the year in which the last
disbursement is made. The closing date for the lotin is June 30, 1996.

Retroactive financing for US$10 million (10 of loan amount) will be allowed,
primarily to cover expenditures that would have been incurred in the third
quarter of 1990 for the Mesdar-Rhourde El Baguel subproject as well as
selected consultant services which are on the critical path to project
implementation (e.g. exploration data base consultant, exploration
promotion/contractual assistance). The signing of a satisfactory on-lending
agreement between SONATRACH and the Fonds de ParticiDation is a condition of
disbursement on the amount corresponding to the study of the petroleum
services subsector (US$0.5 million)
Envaonmn
3.9         The project is expected to have a major positive environmental
impact as it would initiate, for the first time, a comprehensive process by
which the country will address issues related to the environmental impact of
petroleum drilling and production operations in Algeria. This process was
originated by the Bank carrying out, during project appraisal, an
environmental review of such operations, which take place mostly in the
Saharan desert; in the course of this review, a number of issues were
identified, concerning primarily: (i) the need for a detailed procedures
manual for well drilling, testing and abandonment, which should take into
account the hydrogeological characteristics of Algeria's petroleum provinces;
(ii) the need to review current practices for land disposal of drilling muds
and well wastewater (as well as possible alternative uses); (iii) improvements
needed in the handling and disposal of toxic chemicals used in
drilling/production operations; and (iv) organizational arrangements for
environmental regulation monitoring and enforcement within and without the
company.
3.10        As a result of the Bank's review, SONATRACH has already taken a
number of steps to address the above issues: in October 1990, it established a
special Committee at senior management level (under the chairmanship of the
Deputy General Manager for Hydrocarbons) to prepare an Environmental Action
Plan, and a technical committee to implement it. This plan, which was
submitted to the Bank in March 1991 and discussed extensively during loan
negotiations, considers a two-phased approach: the first phase, to be
completed in June 1992, will encompass a comprehensive program of data
collection and assessment of impacts on groundwater, as well as a study of
alternative technologies and comparative costs for remedial action; it would
also cover the preparation on a drilling manual with emphasis on environmental
protection. These activities will be carried out in close coordination with
appropriate Governmental entities (MNI, the Environment Department, and ANRH).
The second phase will be based on the findings of the first phase and will
include acquisition and installation of specialized equipment and the
strengthening of SONATRACH's own monitoring and enforcement capabilities.
SONATRCAO has agreed under the loan to carry out the above Action Plan and
meet with the Bank by June 30, 1992 to jointly review the findings of the
First Phase and proposed follow-up actions. Funding of selected activities to
be carried out under the first phase (e.g. training of staff, specialized
laboratory analyses, etc.) would also be provided under the loan (para. 3.2).

Given its strong environmental dimension, the project has been rated "BI.
SONATRACH has agreed under the loan to carry out the project in accordance
with sound environmental practices.
Renortina Reauiremerns
3.11       SONATRACH has agreed under the loan to provide the Bank with semi-
annual technical progress reports on major aspects of the project as well as a
completion report upon project completion.

IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
Genrl Benefits
4.1         One of the primary benefits of the project would be an enhanced
ability to attract and foster private investmgnts: the entire exploration
promotion component of the project is geared specifically towards promoting
acreage to foreign oil companies; in addition, the study of the petroleum
service sector will aim, inter alia, at identifying ways to improve
productivity through restructuring, greater competition and the development of
a local private service industry. Second, the project is expected to have
major environmental benefits as it provides for specific actions/studies to be
undertaken in the area of toxic waste disposal, water usage and institutional
strengthening (para. 3.2); third, major benefits, although difficult to
quantify, are expected from the strengthening under the project of SONATRACH's
investment planning caRabilities; even minor improvements in this area are
expected to yield major savings in light of the magnitude of SONATRACH's
future investments (US$ 8.7 billion over the next five years). Fourth, the
Bank's direct involvement in the sector and the proposed co-financing
arrangement with Eximbank of Japan, although relatively small when compared to
the sector's overall financial requirements, is expected to be an important
catalyst to SONATRACH's (and Algeria's) renewed ability to enter the
international capital markets, by providing added comfort to potential
commercial lenders. Finally, the enhanced recovery components of the project
would generate very substantial and rapid foreign earnings, while yielding
high returns on investment (see below).
Economic Analhys
4.2         The internal economic rate of return was estimated separately for
the Mesdar/Rhourde El Baguel gas injection subproject and the
Amassak/Tiraremine water injection subproject. For the former, the benefits
were measured by the additional oil production multiplied by the export price
of oil less transportation cost to the export point plus the value of the
injected gas which would be produced after the oil is depleted. The costs
include: the proposed investment (excluding import duties and other taxes);
the natural gas used as fuel and the natural gas injected, both valued at
their economic cost (condensates loss plus depletion premium - para 1.17); and
other operating costs. Under these assumptions, the internal rate of return
was estimated to be 87X. A sensitivity analysis showed that either the
incremental oil production or the price of oil would need to be reduced to
just above one-quarter of their forecast levels (US$18.50/BL increasing by
2.4X p.a. until 2000) in order to reduce the rate of return to the opportunity
cost of capital, estimated to be 10. Other sensitivity analyses were not
considered to be necessary because of the high rate of return. Further
details on the economic analysis of this subproject are given in Annex 4.1.
4.3         For the Amassak/Tiraremine subproject, the benefits were measured
by the additional oil production multiplied by the export price of oil less



- 38 -
transportation cost to the export point. The costs include: the proposed
investment (excluding import duties and other taxes); fuel costs for injecting
the water; and other operating costs. The internal rate of return was
estimated to be 44X. A sensitivity analysis showed that either the
incremental oil production or the price of oil would need to be reduced to
one-sixth of their forecast levels in order to reduce the rate of return to
the opportunity cost of capital. Further details on the economic analysis of
this subproject are given in Annex 4.2.
PWm Risks
4.4         The risks directly associated with the project are those inherent
in the petroleum industry. With respect to the enhanced oil recovery
component, they fall into three main categories related to geology, project
implementation and oil price uncertainty. The geological risk, i.e. that the
performance of the reservoir in response to water or gas injection may not be
as expected, is minimized by the fact that thorough reservoir studies have
been carried out by SONATRACH with the assistance of well-known international
consulting firms. Possible implementation delays will be minimized by
SONATRACH's extensive experience with enhanced oil recovery projects and its
use of qualified foreign contractors. Finally, economic and financial
sensitivity analyses have shown that oil prices would have to decrease to
unrealistic levels for the projects to become uneconomic (see above). Market
risk is not considered to be significant as crude oil is a fully tradeable
commodity, and Algeria has declared its intention to maximize oil production
and sales, subject to technical optimization criteria (para. 1.32).

FIRST PETROLE-UM PROJCb<T
ECONOMIC COST OF NATURAL GAS
1.   The largest components of the economic cost consist of transmission and
distribution costs calculated by the average incremental cost approach using
SONELGAZ's projected expenditures and sales for the period 1990 through 1994.
The long-run marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero since SONATRACH
produces more gas than it sells in order to extract the condensates and much
of the LPGs; excess dry gas is then reinjected into the reservoirs, thereby
increasing ultimate recovery of condensates. This implies that when a unit of
gas is sold rather than reinjected there is a loss in ultimate recovery of
condensates (but according to SONATRACH no significant loss in LPGs). The
present volume of this loss net of reinjection costs is therefore assigned as
a cost of gas supply in the table below; it accounts for about 40X of the
weighted average cost to final consumers (US$0.36 per MMBTU). Estimates of
the deletion nremium are subject to much uncertainty since they depend on
forecasts of the date of last production from proven gas reserves and the
value of gas at that time. However, given Algeria's abundant gas resources,
the depletion premium is bound to account for only a small portion of the
total economic cost of gas to final consumers (US$0.19 per MMBTU vers.us the
total average cost of US$0.83).J,

2.    The assumptions used to calculate the economic cost of gas are given
below for the following components: condensates loss, depletion premium, and
average incremental transmission and distribution costs.
Condensates Loss
3.    SONATRACH provided estimates of additional condensate production by year
at Rhourde Nouss together with estimates of the amount of gas injected by
year. Assuming that the per unit value of the condensates grows according to
the current World Bank projection of international crude oil prices, the
present value of additional condensate production divided by the present value
of injected gas gives a figure of cDA 1.87/thermie (in January 1990 prices).
This is a gross measure of the condensate lost as a result of selling 1
thermie of gas rather than reinjecting it.
4.    On the basis of data for the Nesdar subproject (Annex 5.1),
0.133 thermie of gas is used as fuel for each thermie reinjected, and would
therefore be saved in the absence of reinjection. Similarly operating costs
for reinjection of cDA 0.99/thermie would be saved by not reinjecting.
Adjusting the gross value of condensate gas by these two savings yields a net
value of cDA 0.59/thermie, in January 1990 prices. After adjustments for
inflation and devaluation, this is equivalent to cDA2.32/th or US$0.36/MMBTU
in April 1991 prices.
Depletion Premium
5.   Unassociated plus associated proven gas reserves were 3200 bcm on
January 1, 1989.
6.    Projected cumulated net production through the year 2000 is 978 bcm.
Net production is assumed equal to sales plus 15.9 bcm per year from shrinkage
due to removal of gas liquid and s.el for reinjection.
7.    If sales and net production grow by 4S per year after the year 2000,
about I percentage point per year less than from 1989 to 2000, proven reserves
will be exhausted by early 2016.
8.    The 1989 export price of gas of cDA 6.5/thermie less average incremental
transport cost of cDA 0.37 (see below) gives a field value of cDA 6.14 If
this value grows at the same rate as the current Bank projection for
international crude oil prices, it would reach cDA 7.93 in 2000. It is
assumed to remain constant thereafter.
9.    At the time of exhaustion the marginal cost of production is assumed to

10.   Estimates of awerage incremental gas transmission and distribution costs
are shown in tables 2 thru 4 below. These costs (expressed in January 1990
prices) exclude the portion of connection costs paid directly by customers.
The investment c^8sts exclude duties and taxes, but the results have been
adjusted to include operating costs equal to 3X of cumulated new investments.
The gas sales figures used in the transmission cost calculation are total
national sales of gas (incl. exports). The sales figures used in the
distribution cots calculation are for SONELGAZ only. All costs have been
adjusted for inflation and devaluation between January 1990 and April 1991 for
inclusion in table 1.
11.   Since low-pressure as well as medium-pressure customers are served from
the medium-pressure distribution network the only cost paid by low-pressure
customers is for equipment to reduce pressure. Since this cost is covered by
the connection charge which is paid directly by the customers, it does not
affect the calculations below.

SummarX Ilbnr   on an  prf Sector EntjgWf
1.          Subsequent to restructuring of SONATRACH  activities related to
refining and distribution of petroleum products were carried out by NAFTAL.
In 1987 NAFTAL inturn was restructured and its mandate was refocused on
transportation and distribution of LPG, CNG and petroleum products and a new
enterprise, NAFTEC, was established to promote, develop, and manage petroleum
refining in Algeria. Since the nationalization of the petroleum distribution
in 1968, distribution of all products in Algeria has been in the h nds of
SONATRACH followed by NAFTAL. Gasoline is distributed through 1,260 pump
stations. Expansion of the distribution network is planed, including 300 new
pump stations, a network of multi-product pipelines and storage facilities.
NAFTAL has a fleet of 4,600 tanker trucks that moves 50X of all petroleum
products; another 25X is transported by rail and 25X by pipeline. NAFTAL is
also responsible for distribution of LPC through 60 service stations which can
serve 18,000 vehicles. About 8,000-10,000 vehicles are equipped to run on
LPG. To encourage replacement of gasoline by gas, the price of LPG is set
below that of gasoline. NAFTAL has over 25,800 employees.
NAEQ
2.          Refining in Algeria is the responsibility of NAFTEC.  It was
established in August 1987 to produce LPG, motor-fuels, solvents, aromatic
hydrocarbons, lubricants, paraffins and bitumen for domestic and export
markets. The entity owns and manages five plants with about 4,000 employees
at the following sites:
Hassi t4essaoud I - It has a capacity of 200,000 tons per year.  It
processes Hassi-Messaoud stabilized crude to produce LPG, gas-oil and
kerosine for local consumption.
Hassi-Messaoud II - It has a capacity of 1,070 million tons per year.
It supplies gasoline, benzine, kerosine, and gas-oil to the local
market.
AILrs RefinerY:  The refinery is located 20 km. east of Algiers.  It
has a capacity of 2,700 million tons per year. It mainly produces
motorfuels, jetfuel and LPG for the county's northern market. It also
operates a marine terminal.
Argew-RefLUM: The refinery is located in the industrial area of Arzew
on the El-Mahgoun plateau. The refinery is designed to supply fuels,
lubricants, bitumen and paraffins to the local industries and export
surplus motor-fuels, naphtha and kerosine. Its main facilities are:

Anmex 1.11
Page 2 of 4
-     An atmospheric distillation unit with capacity of 2,500 million
tons per year.
-    A catalytic reforming unit.
-     A gas recuperation unit.
-    An oxidation unit for bitumen production with annual capacity of
120,000 tons.
-     Two lubricant-and-grease production units with capacities of
50,000 tons and 120,000 tons per year.
Skikda Refinery: This refinery is situated in the industrialized area
east of Skikda. It is designed to process a mixer of reduced imported
and stabilized domestic crude with capacity of 15,277 million tons per
year. Its main facilities are:
-     Two atmospheric distillation units of 7.5 million ton capacity
each.
-     Two gas processing units.
-    A catalytic reformer.
-     Utility facilities and a pumpstation to forward products through
the pipeline to the two Skikda ports and various distribution
depots.
3.          The Enterprise Nationale de Grands Travaux Petroliers (GTP) was
created in 1980 as a result of SONATRACH's restructuring. GTP is a
contracting engineering firm which provides engineering, installation,
supervision and maintenance services to the petroleum industry. The company
was initially formed in 1969 as a small engineering firm with 700 employees
named ALTRA. In 1970 SONATRACH bought the company and gradually expanded it
to implement civil engineering, plant installations, road and pipeline
constructing and mechanical engineering tasks. In 1980 the comparny had grown
by 6,000 staff and currently employs over 7,400. The company has an annual
turnover of about DA 800 million equal to US$100 million, however, its
financial performance is not satisfactory. The management of GTP attribute
weak financial performance of the institution to: (i) civil service pay scale
which does not provide adequate remuneration for operational staff working in
the field causing overstaffing in administration and understaffing of
operational units in the field; (ii) lack of spare parts and not being able to
replace old machinery and equipment due to shortage of foreign exchange; and
(lii) sluggish growth of petroleum sector in recent years. In general the
organization has adequate technical and professional staff to carryout
projects acceptable to the industry standard, however, absence of appropriate
corporate structure prevent achievement of satisfactory performance.

4.          Enterprise Nationale des Travaux aux Puits (ENTP) is a large
drilling contracting company with over 7,400 staff. It owns 63 drilling rigs
of which 42 are operable. The drilling performance of the company is far
beilow the industry standard, the average completion record of ENTP for one
year is 110,000 meters per year,which means that each rig is used to drill one
well per year. This is about 1/4th of the normal rate. The financial
performance of ENTP is proportional to its drilling. The management of ENTP
attributes the main cause of the low performance to: (i) rig waiting time
resulting from uncertain work program; (ii) late receipt of invoices from
client (SONATRACH) which ENTP bears the financial charges and interests -
this makes up 50% of ENTP's deficits; (iii) low drilling rates set in 1983
which are far bellow current rates; and (iv) overstaffing - 70% of the
company's operating cost is for salaries - and other maladies of public sector
regulations. Consequently ENTP has diversified its operation in to:
catering, transportation, maintenance and manufacturing of machine parts.
5.          ENTP's turnover is approximately DA 1.0 billion per year, 80% of
which is related to its drilling activities and the other 20X is for catering
and maintenance work. In 1983 ENTP had a deficit of AD 350; million in 1988
the deficit has been reduced to DA 100 million through 30% staff reduction and
other cost saving measures. Although involvement in peripheral activities
have helped to reduced ENTP's deficit it has prevented the institution to
devote its full attention to increasing efficiency in its drilling operation.
ENAF OR
6.          In 1966 a joint venture drilling company was formed between Sedco
(USA) and SONATRACH starting with 3 rigs; by 1981 20 more rigs had been added.
The joint venture was dissolved in 1981, ENAFOR becoming another public sector
enterprise owned by the Government and working for the Government. Currently
ENAFOR has about 2,800 staff who operate 26 drilling rigs. It utilizes 80X of
its capacity drilling about 40 wells per year for total of about 80,000
meters. The annual turn over of ENAFOR is about DA 550 million. The
institution has been making a profit except for one year when there was a blow
out due to lax safety practices, consequently the operation was held up until
all the facilities were inspected, upgraded and adequate safety provisions
were installed. Company's operation is based on SONATRACH's work program.
Shortage of foreign exchange, public sector salary scale and high attrition
rate of technical staff are the institution's main constraints.
ENAG  0
7.          Enterprise Nationale Algerian Geophysique (ENAGEO) started work in
1967 with two seismic crews as a joint venture between SONATRACH and a
foreign firm. After nationalization it was absorbed by SONATRACH as part of
the country's exploration group in SONATRACH. In 1982 it was detached from
SONATRACH and became an independent geophysical seismic data acquisition,
about 952 of ENAGEO's work is done for SONATRACH of which 852 is related to
exploration and 152 to production activities. The entity's annual turnover is



- 56 -
A&ms wex 
Page 4 of 4
DA (300-400) million. Currently ENAGEO has about 2,500 staff operating 10
seismic crews and plans to add two more shortly. From 1982 to 1988 ENAGEO has
shown profit. The profit has been decreasing continuously due to increased
costs and stable rates which are to be negotiated annually between SONATRACH
and ENAGEO, nevertheless, in practice the rates for ENAGEO's services have
been set by the client. Salaries constitute the major portion of the
operating cost, about 701 of the total. Due to unavailability of foreign
exchange the entity have not been able to replace its equipment at the cost of
its work quality. The management of ENAGEO is counting on the new changes
resulting from the proposed law of public enterprises autonomy, availability
of foreign exchange and salary structure reform law currently debated in the
parliament to improve its performance.
ENSP
8.          Enterprise Nationale Des Service Aux Puits (ENSP) was created in
1981 as a result of SONATRACH restructuring. ENSP was has inherited assets and
staff of three joint ventures: (i) Dresser Industries ; (ii) Baker Hughs; and
(iii) Christensen of USA with SONATRACH. Its main function is to provide well
services namely wireline, perforation, well testing, well cementing, well
stimulation, and drill fluid. ENSP is the only company which has competitors
in some of the areas it is active. Consequently the company performance has
been enhanced. With its 2,300 staff it has 100l of the market for drilling
mud service, 60X of the well cementing, 75X of wireline service, 401 of the
well testing.

ALGERIA
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION
Gno
1.          The geology of Algeria which is relevant to petroleum, is
comprised of three major components:
-     the crystalline massifs to the south, in which there is no
petroleum potential;
-     the Saharan Platform, which is represented by an irregularly
northerly thickening wedge of sedimentary rock, subdivided into a
series of basins, the eastern three of which contain virtually all
of Algeria's established production of oil and gas; and
-    The geologically complex area of the Atlas Mountain Chains, or
Orogen, which forms the northern portion of the country, and
which, although it has yielded numerous shows and indications of
oil, is not yet petroleum productive.
h"bar-o P -orm
2.          From the tectonic point of view, the Algerian Sahara is a part of
the western portion of the North African continental plate, in which the
crystalline basement has been down-warped over time, and is now covered with a
northerly-thickening wedge of Paleozoic and Meso-Cenozoic sediments. The
Platform is bordered on the south by the crystalline massifs of the Hoggar and
related areas, and on the north by the South Atlas fault system. This latter
separates the relatively stable Saharan Platform from the Alpine-related Atlas
Mountain Complex which have been considerably deformed through folding and
faulting of the involved sedimentary and underlying basement section as a
result of the continental collision between North Africa and southern Europe.
3.          The thick sedimentary cover of the Algerian Sahara is made up
chiefly of a transgressive, unconformable Paleozoic sedimentary section which
overlies the PreCambrian basement. The younger Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary
section is considerably less developed here then it is elsewhere in Algeria.
4.          The Paleozoic sequence includes formations dating from the
Cambrian to the Carboniferous in age, and largely clastic in nature, becoming
generally finer grained as they become younger. The Mesozoic where it is
present, contains a complete sedimentary section which is comprised of
continental, lagoonal and marine sediments.
5.          The Algerian Sahara has been divided into two hydrocarbon-bearing
provinces: the Western Province, and the Eastern Province, the latter of
which contains the hydrocarbon-productive Triassic-age basins of Oued Mya,
Illizi and Ghadames.

Page 2 of 6
6.          fl1 Western Province is made up of six separate basins: the
Tindouf and Reggane basins of the far west; and the Ahnet, Mouydir, Timimoun
and Bechar basins in central Algeria. The major portions of these relatively
deep basins are filled with Paleozoic-age marine sediments . The thickness of
these sediments ranges from 4500 meters in the Ahnet basin, through 6000-6500
meters in Reggane, to 7-8000 meters in the Tindouf and Timimoun basins.
7.          The Tindouf and Reggane basins are separated by the Bou-Bernous
high. The Tindouf basin is asymmetrical, with the axial area being
considerably displaced towards the northern edge, adjacent to the Anti Atlas
mountains of Morocco. The south eastern part is monoclinal and has a very
shallow northerly dip into the basinal axis. Although barely explored, this
southern flank is however, considered to be highly prospective because of its
source rock and reservoir sequences. In similar fashion, the Paleozoic of the
Reggane depression also includes sediments ranging in age from Cambrian to the
upper Carboniferous, and is asymmetrical with its axis aligned south-
east/northwest. Indications of both oil and gas have been found throughout
the Lower Devonian, but as yet no commercial production has been established.
8.          The Ahnet basin lies to the east of Reggane, and is separated from
it by the Azzel Matti saddle. The Paleozoic sedimentary sequence, which is
similar to the two previous basins, crops out over most of the Ahnet Basin.
The structural evolution of the basin is closely related to the tectonics of
the crystalline massif of the Hoggar to the south. As a result, the
structures in general involve basement block faulting, are large in aerial
extent and amplitude, and have random orientations.   The reservoirs of
commercial importance found here include the Ordovician fractured quartzites,
and the overlying Devonian irregular channel sands enclosed in a shale
envelope. Both reservoirs have proved to often be gas bearing, but because of
the irregular nature of their reservoir characteristics, their contained
reserves are difficult to determine with accuracy.
9.          The Mouydir Basin lies to the east of Ahnet, and is separated from
it by the Idjerane arch. It is similar in its stratigraphy to that of the
Ahnet Basin, and like the Ahnet, the Paleozoic formations also outcrop in the
southern part of the depression. The basin has not been thoroughly studied,
and only a small portion of it has been explored seismically, with only a few
wells having been drilled.
10.         The Timisoun Basin is situated between the Western Great Erg sand
dune field overlying the Becahar Basin on the west, and the 0ued Mya Basin
which contains the giant Hassi-R-Nel and related gas fields, on the east.
Hydrocarbon reservoirs have been found in numerous intervals within the basin,
including the Sabaa oil discoveries, but none have gone into commercial
development yet.
11.         The Becahar Basin, and adjacent areas in the western portion of
the country adjacent to Morocco, contain sandstone reservoirs of the lower
Paleozoic succession in which fracture porosity is important, the porous
clastic reservoirs of the Devonian, and the overlying reef limestone
reservoirs of the Upper Devonian. The largest indications of gas and oil have



- 59 -
AnE!ex 1. 12
Page 3 of 6
been encountered in the latter reservoirs, but these too, have not entered
into commercial development.
12.         The Eastern Province includes the productive Triassic basins of
Oued Mya, Chadames and Illizi Basins in which are to be found all of the
commercial oil and gas fields currently in production in Algeria. The
Reservoir horizons are numerous and include the Cambrian, Ordovician,
Devonian, Carboniferous and Triasssic formations. The chief source for the
oil and gas are to be found in the Gothlandinan shales of the Silurian age,
which overlie the Ordovician. Sealing formations are found in several salts,
mostly of Triassic age, and shale units.
13.         The Cambrian reservoirs are comprised of sandstones and
conglomerates, generally becoming more fine grained upwards, and are
productive at the giant Hassi-Messaoud and Rhourde El-Baguel oil fields. The
basal section everywhere is comprised of coarse to micro-conglomeratic sands
overlying the crystalline basement. Porosities range from 15 to 20X, and
permeabilities from 10 to 1000 millidarcies in the fracture zones. The
Ordovician is comprised of alternating sandstone and shale formations and is
only rarely productive.
14.         The Silurian shales are represented generally by black graptolitic
shales whose base is strongly radioactive. The upper part occasionally
contains sandstone beds, several of which are productive in the Oued Mya
Basin. These shales are generally considered to be the principal source rocks
for petroleum in the Eastern Provence.
15.         The Devonian and Carboniferous formations of Paleozoic age are
limited in extent, and occur only in the northern portions of the area. Their
included sands occasionally produce in the area, with porosities of 201, and
permeabilities reaching 1000 millidaries. The most notable production
however, is found in adjacent areas of Tunisia to the east.
16.         '        rast to the Western Province, the Eastern Province is
commonly ovei      y a thick, well developed Mesozoic section, which is
transgressive  . unconformable with respect to the underlying Paleozoic
sedimentary section. The lowest of these Mesozoic sections is Triassic in
age, and commences with continentally derived sandstones and shales, often
containing andesite volcanic flows, overlain by salt and anyhrdrite
evaporites. The latter make excellent cap rocks for the underlying ubiquitous
basal clastics which commonly form oil and gas reservoirs. The latter form by
far the largest reservoir in the Province, and contain porosities of 15-20X,
with permeabilities of 500 to 1000 millidarcies. These permeabilities
increase to 3000 millidarcies at the Oued Noumer field, and 5000 millidaricies
at the giant gas field of Hassi-R-Mel South.
17.         The younger Jurassic system is well dcveloped in this province,
and is comprised characteristically of dolomites, with lesser amounts of
evaporites and marine shales. The youngest rocks which are generally found
throughout the province are Cretaceous in age, and are comprised at their base
of continental sands and shales, grading upward to carbonates overlain by
anhydrite and salt. Much of the Ghadames B sin, and to a lesser extent the



- 60 -
ArmlilX 1.S
Page 4 of 6
Oued Hya basin, are overlain on the surface by the sand dune field of the
Grand Erg Oriental, which has severely restricted exploration.
18.         For the reasons given above, the Ghadames Basin is the lest
explored of the productive basins in the Eastern Province, although it has
been well explored in adjacent Libya, east of the dune field, where a large
number of small to medium sized oil fields have been discovered. Recent
exploration by Sonatrach and foreign companies has however resulted in the
discoveries of several hydrocarbon deposits in the Algerian portion of the
basin, along with the localization of several additional prospective areas.
The prospective reservoirs are similar to those described above. The source
rock, as with Oued Mya Basin, is the Silurian shales whose thickness ranges
from 250 to 300 meters. Similar shales in the underlying Ordovician, as well
as the younger Devonian and Carboniferous shales also have similar source rock
characteristics.
19.         The Illizi Basin, lies along the south-eastern border of Algeria
extending into Libya, between the Ghadames basin to the north, and the
crystalline basement rocks which are exposed in the Hoggar Massif to the
south. Its Paleozoic stratigraphy is very similar to the other basins of the
Saharan platform, although it to a large extent lacks the limestones and
dolomites of the upper Devonian. These formations outcrop along the southern
margin of the basin, and have been studied extensively. In the northern
portion of the basin, the younger Mesozoic formations appear in similar
fashion, thickening to the north as they plunge into the subsurface.
20.         As with the other basins, the principal source rock is the
Silurian shales, with a thickness similar to that found in the Ghadames Basin.
The principal reservoirs are in the Cambrian sands, the Ordovician sands and
quartzites, and the channel sands of the Devonian. Younger reservoirs are
also found in the Carboniferous sands, and the overlying Triassic sands.
Generally speaking the reservoirs imprvve as they become younger, with
porosities in the lower reservoirs in the five to eight percent range,
increasing upwards to highs of 25X in some of the Triassic reservoirs. Depths
to the reservoirs vary from a few hundred meters to 3500 meters. It is in
this basin that the first giant field, the Edjeleh field, was found in 1956 as
well as numerous subsequently discovered oil and gas fields.
21.         To a large extent, the structural deformation of this basin is the
result of large basement faults which have propagated upward into the
overlying sedimentary section over time. These faults diminish northward into
the center of the basin. It is this fault-derived structural deformation
which provides most of the entrapment of hydrocarbons in the Illizi basin,
rather than fold structures derived from compression.
22.         Exploration has therefore been focused on the ever finer
delineation of these fault structures, until at present, there are no known
structures left to explore. Exploration of the basin is hence at a mature
stage, and future exploration must focus on the more subtle facies changes
which involve horizonal variations between reservoir sands and entrapping
shales around the basin margins, and within the basin.

The North of AeIQa
23.         The Atlas Mountains of Algeria are actually comprised of two
mountain chains, the Tell to the north, along the coast of Algeria, and the
Saharan Atlas in the south, facing the Sahara desert, and separated from the
Tell by the Haut Plateaux.
24.         The Saharan Atlas is a long chain of mountains extending from the
Moroccan border, eastward across Algeria Into Tunisia. The mountain chain is
separated from the Saharan platform by a complex system of flexures,
ovcrthrust faults and en echelon faults. To the north of the Saharan Atlas,
between it and the more northern Tell Atlas mountains, is the region of the
High Plateaux.
25.         The Tell itself is a complex geographical and geological region
which includes thick sedimentary sections as well as crystalline massifs, both
of which have been severally deformed in a manner similar to that seen along
the northern margin of the Alps mountains in Europe. Superimposed upon this
Tellian complex are several younger basins, such as the Chelif near Oran,
which largely postdates, but to some extent till incorporates the last phases
of deformation which the Tellian Atlas underwent.
26.         Little is known concerning the offshore portion of Algeria, to the
north of the Tell, but by comparison with similar geology in Morocco it
largely postdates the mountain building period which formed the Atlas complex,
and represents a post-orogenic relaxation phase. Its petroleum prospectivity
is unknown at present.
27.         Several oil prospective areas are present in this Northern Region,
the foremost of which is the Miocene Chelif basin near the coast, east of
Oran. It was in fact this basin in which the first oil exploration was done
in Algeria prior to the turn of the century. Additional potential areas are
present in the western Saharan Atlas area, in which the Jurassic horizons
provide the primary objectives.  Further east, in the Sudest Constantinoise
Basin, which lies adjacent to the Tunisiaia border, the principal objectives
are the Cretaceous reef carbonates, in which frequent shows and minor
production which have recently been discovered are thought to be sourced from
the older Jurassic shales in the adjacent foreland fold belt at the edge of
the Saharan Platform to the south.
28.         The syntheses of these basins, in which the disparate elements
required for the generation, migration and entrapment of petroleum, are pulled
together into a coherent exploration plan, are as yet unrealized. This is
primarily because of the geologic complexity of these basins, and the lack of
local availability of the advanced geophysical and geological tools and
expertise which is required for their evaluation.
29.         This expertise, and to a lesser extent the knowledge of how to use
the available tools, have not as yet been utilized in Algeria by Sonatrach.
The reasons for this are complex, but stem largely from the lack of need for
this type of expertise in the exploraticn of the simpler basins which have
heretofore provided Algeria's exploration success, and commercial production.

In short, this Northern area represents new frontiers of exploration
technology and methodology for both Algeria and Sonatrach.
Histoy of Oil ExDlomtion
30.         Although exploration for petroleum in Algeria began at the end of
the 1880s in the Chelif basin, in the northwest portion of the country, the
first commercial discovery was not made until 1948, at Oued Guetirini (in the
Saharan Atlas, 150 km southward from Algiers). Between 1953 and 1956
exploration extended southward, into the then unknown Sahara Desert, where the
Algerian sector includes a significant portion of the major sedimentary fringe
of the northern margin of the African continent: in 1953, oil prospecting
licenses were granted on an area of about 250,000 km2 in the northern Sahara
to SN REPAL and CFP (Total), which subsequently entered into a partnership
agreement. Hydrocarbon shows encouraged these companies to undertake a full
reconnaissance program throughout the Saharan exploration area, including the
drilling of several deep (3,000 meter) stratigraphic sells. The results of
this combined program was the discovery of the Edjeleh field in the Illizi
basin, adjacent to the Libyan border, by Compagnie de recherche et
d'exploration des petroles (CREPS), followed by the discovery of the Hassi
Messaoud field by SN REPAL, in July 1956. Delineation drilling was followed
by a full field development program, and the construction of a first pipeline
to the Mediterranean Coast, which was completed in November 1959.
3:.         Further to the Northwest, this phase of exploration drilling
resulted in the discovery of the Hassi R'Mel gas field in November 1956.
During the following decade more than fifty additional major oil and gas
fields were also discovered in the Illizi, Ghadames and Oued Mya Basins lying
within the Saharan platform, and were put into production. Production levels
following these discoveries and their subsequent delineation, were dictated by
the construction of pipelines to the coast, and the development of the
petrochemical complexes which were needed to handl,-. treat, ship, and refine
the produced hydrocarbons. Additional major gas fields and several smaller
oil fields were discovered later as exploration moved further south, to the
Ahnet Basin and adjacent areas to the northwest of the town of In Salah. Due
to the distance to market, however, these more recent fields have yet to be
put into commercial production. In more recent years, several small oil
fields have also been discovered in the Constantine basin, near the Tunisian
border, to the north of the Saharan platform.

Assumptions Used In SONATlACI1's Financial Forecasts
Macroeconomic Assumotlonu:
1.          World Bank estimates are used for domestic and foreign inflation
forecasts. Domestic inflation is expected to gradually decline from its highs
of 23.5% and 24.4% in 1991 end 1992 to stabilize around 10.5% in 1994.
Foreign inflation is expected to peak at 9% in 1991 and subsequently range
from Ov te' 3.8% p.a.  This and the already overvalued level of Algerian Dinar
implies a real depreciation of the currency. The Dinar's depreciation against
the US dollar {s forecast to peak at 59.5% in 1991 and decrease progressively
to 4.6% in 1995. (See Attachment 1)
Price Assumotions:
2.         Tlte export and domestic price forecasts on hydrocarbon sales of
SONATRACH are presented in detail in Attachment 1. The export crude oil
prices conform to the World Bank's forecasts. Price projections for other
hydrocarbon exports are made in accordance with the yearly price increase of
crude oil.
Production, Domstic and InteaUonal Sales Volume A"sumotions:
3.          SONATRACH's production schedule provided to us reflects its
physical production and transportation capacity, new investments program and
medium term marketing strategy. Domestic sales forecasts are based on the
expected demand growth in each of the product items. International sales of
crude oil are in line with Algeria's current Opec quota. Natural gas, IPG and
LNG export forecasts are derived from already established individual sales
contracts or advanced negotiations. (See Attachment 2)
Qoeratina C:ost Awmations:
4.          An approximate average unit cost for each production activity is
derived by SONATPACH analysts in accordance with current cost trends and
reflecting changing techniques and processes, and economies of scale. Other
costs are calculated as a percent of total revenues. (See Attachment 4).
PeRMmmmtln Asum .tl
5.          An average straight line depreciation over 15 years is assumed for
all capital expenditures, except for Exploration investments for which 90% of
the expenditures are depreciated at the end of the same year. The forecast
assumes that cnnual depreciation expense would be equivalent to 7X of the
average gross assets in operation during the year (except for exploration
investments).

Oebt Asumpt(onA:
6.          SONATRACH's existing debt, which is presented in its official
balance sheets at original exchange rates of the time of borrowing was for
forecasting purposes revalued and updated yearly by using prevailing exchange
rates, to reflect a realistic debt structure. Exchange losses on yearly debt
repayments are calculated by the increase in the value of repayments due to
the difierence in exchange rates between the beginning of the year and the
middle of the year, where repayments take place.
7.          SONATRACH's future debt is forecasted according to the assumption
that 85X of its future foreign currency investments will be financed by
foreign loans and 701 of its DA investments will be financed by domestic
loans. The rest will be self-financed by SONATRACH. Terms and conditions
assumed are as follows:
Foreign Loans:    1) World Bank Loan:  7.5  interest, 5 years of grace, 15
years maturity; 2) other loans: 11.5X interest, 2 years of
grace, 8 years maturity.
Domestic Loans:   15X interest, 2 years of grace, 8 years maturity.
Other Financial Staement AssUmtlons:
8.          All future financial statement are presented in current dinars.
Forecasts made in constant dinars are converted into their current values
using expected inflation rates. Cash and Retained Earnings forecasts are
derived from Sources and Utilizations of Funds Statements and Income
Statements respectively, Accounts Receivable were assumed at 60 days of
sales. Other Current Assets and Current Liabilities are assumed to increase
at the same rate as local inflation.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF MESDARMOUROE EL 6AGUEL SUBPROIECT
Assumptions
Costs and benefits are all valued in constant January 1990 prices.
The oil price at the wellhead is assumed to increase from the 1989
export value of DA 148 ($18. -. per barrel, less DA 3.2 transport cost, in
accordance with the Bank's cuw.ent projection for international crude oil
prices. The Bank's projection goes only to the year 2000. The crude price is
assumed to remain constant after 2000.
The economic cost of gas is equal to the condensate cost plus depletion
premium (Annex 2.3). The former is assumed to escalate over time to the year
2000 with the international oil price, after *which it is replaced by the
marginal cost of production, assumed to be cDA 1.9 per thermie. The depletion
premium grows by lOX per year.
Investment costs exclude duties and taxes.
Fuel costs are equal to the gas used for fuel multiplied by the economic
costs.
The costs of injected gas are equal to the injected gas quantities
multiplied by the economic costs.
Other operating costs include: personnel costs, spare parts, insurance
and maintenance expenses.
The injected gas would be produt.ed after the year 2017 according the
following profile supplied by SONATRACH: 2 bcm in 2018 and 2019, 1.5 bcm in
2020 and 1 bem in each of the years 2021 through 2025. The annual quantities
forecast to be produced are multiplied by the depletion premium value of
cDA 3.94 per thermie for the years from 2017 on, and then converted to present
value using a discount rate of lOX. The total net present value assigned to
this production is treated as a benefit of the sub-project.

ALGERIA
FIRST PETROLEUM PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF AMASSAK SUBPROJECT
Assumptions
Costs and benefits are all valued in constant January 1990 prices.
The oil price profile is the same as for the Mesdar subproject (Annex
5.1), but it is DA 2 per barrel lower in each year because of additional
transportation cost (Amassak is further south than Mesdar; see map).
Investment costs exclude duties and taxes.
Water operating costs include the fuel costs of injection water
estimated to be DA 1 per cubic meter of water injected.
Other operating costs include: personnel costs, spare parts, insurance
and maintenance costs.
