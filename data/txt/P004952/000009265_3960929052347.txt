MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A LOAN TO SONATRACH
FOR A FIRST PETROLEUM PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a loan to Sociote
nationale pour la recherche, la production, le transport, 1A transformation et la
commercialisation des hydrocarbures (SONATRACH) with the guarantee of the
Government of Algeria for US$100 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity
including five years grace; it would help finance the first Bank operation in
Algeria's petroleum sector.
2.         hackground.  When Algeria became independent, the production and
export of crude oil was its main industrial activity as well as the principal
source of government revenue. At the same time, the potential for exploiting the
hydrocarbon sector had scarcely been tapped, partLcularly for natural gas of
which Algeria possessed enormous reserves amounting to more than 3 trillion cubic
meters, i.e. about 4 percent of the world total. Two objectives were therefore
set for the petroleum sector: first, to exploit its foreign exchange earning
potential as a means of financing the development of the rest of the economy;
and, second, to improve tiie value added ln the petroleum sect r itself by
developing downstream activities and by exploiting the countiy's gas reserves.
In parallel, petroleum activities were to contribute to Z%e acquisition of new
technology and the upgrading of the country's human capital base. Two and a half
decades later these objectives have been largely met but, as in many other
petroleum dominated economies, there have also been some detrimental side
effects.
3.          On the positive side, diversified petroleum export revenues (US$12.2
billion in 1990, of which refined products and natural gas represented 22X each)
have, at least until very recently, enabled the country to maintain a very high
rate of capital Jnves.tment, develop its soclo-economic infrastructure, and
provide for the basio needs of a rapidly growing population. On the other hand,
the investments financed from these petroleum revenues have for a variety of
reasons not generated the full economic benefits that were expected of them, and
within the petroleum sector, the emphasis on self-sufficiency and the marginal
role assigned to the private sector have led to a significant reduction in the
level of new discoveries and to areas of technical inefficiency and backwardness
in the country's petroleum operations. SONATRACH, the national oil company set
up in 19631/ mirrors these strengths and weaknesses.  Overall it is probably the
most technologically and managerially advanced public enterprise in Algeria and
has been the training ground for many of the country's national policymakers.
However, because of a decade of isolation from the international oil industry
(until about 1987), it now lags behind in areas which have seen recent
technological advance.
4.          Confronted with a steady decline in the country's petroleum resource
base and a drop in foreign exchange earnings and fiscal revenues resulting from
falling oil prices, the Government shifted, in the late 1980s, its petroleum
strategy towards (i).reinforcing the role of the private sector through the
adoption in 1986 of a new, more attractive petroleum law for petroleum

exploration/development by international oil companies and through the
progressive opening up of the service sector to local and foreign private
contractors; (ii} improving the efficiency of the sector's public enterprises
(including SONATRACH) by giving them more managerial and financial autonomy while
exposing them gradually to foreign competition; and (Wi) maximizing gas exports
by adopting a more flexible marketing/pricing strategy in order to regain lost
market shares and fully utilize existing production and liquefaction facilities.
In this context, SONATRACH's medium term objective is to reach a level of
efficiency and know-how which will euable it not only to continue playing an
important role in the Algerian petroleum sector, in full competition with other
oil companies, but also to develop its international activities on a commercial
basis following the steps of other well-managed national oil companies (NOCs).
These policy changes have already started to bear fruit over the last two years
as SONATRACH has signed a number of gas export contracts with new clients (in
Japan, the US, Southern Europe, etc.), and has entered into eleven exploration
contracts with seven foreign oil companies (with negotiations well advanced on
several other contracts). A foreign joint-venture was also formed in 1990 for
oil well services and a major breakthrough was most recently (April 1991)
achieved with the signing of the first joint-venture agreement for the
development of existing reserves (on the Hamra condensate field).
5.          Although the overall direction of Algeria's policy in the energy
sector, and more specifically the petroleum subsector, is appropriate, there are
a number of golicy isgjs  which will need further attention in the coming years.
The first set of issues concerns the need to enhance the efficiency of petroleum
exploration and production operations through, inter alia, (i) further
improvements in both the acreage promotion process and the substance of the
current legal/contractual framework for investment by foreign oil companies;
(ii) restructuring of state-owned petroleum enterprises; and (iii) development of
the local private sector (starting with the petroleum services subsector).
Second, the Government needs to integrate current efforts aimed at developing gas
and LNG exports into the context of an integrated gas development and utilization
strategy, based on a detailed analysis of the economic value of gas for different
possible uses (including its transformation for industrial purposes). Third,
Algeria needs to pursue its e.forts in energy demand management and conservation.
The key to achieving this objective lies in bringing domestic energy price up to
international levele. A major step towards addressing this issue has recently
(April 1991) been taken, with substantial increases enacted for most energy
products (261 on a weighted average basis). As a result, the average price of
natural gas and petroleum products has now moved up to 751 and 641 of economic
cost respectively. Nevertheless, the prices of certain products (essentially gas
oil and LPG) remain substantially below their economic cost, and this will
continue to require attention in the coming year.
6.         Bank's Role and Lending Stratefy.  The Bank's strategy for ast  tance
to Algeria focusses on supporting the country's economic reform program and the
Government's drive towards improved resource allocation and productivity. The
Bank is implementing this strategy through adjustment lending (an enterprise and
financial sector adjustment loan was recently approved and a fiscal and trade
adjustment loan is currently being prepared) and investment operations targeted
at enhanclng the efficiency of productive sectors and the delivery of social and
public services. Bank involvement in the petroleum sector is consonant with this
strategy in view of the sector's predominant role in the economy as revenue
generator and catalyst for industrial development. Specifically, the Bank's
intervention in the sector aims at: (i) addressing key sector issues (see
above), particularly as they relate to other sectors where major reforms are



-3-
underway and where Bank operatioas are considered (e.g. energy-incensive
industries); (ii) mobilizing financing for the sizeable foreign currency
requirements of the sector, through direct funding and co-financing arrangements:
and (iii) providing catalytic support for increased involvement by the
International petroleum industry in developing Algeria's substantial hydrocarbon
potential.
7.          Given the complexity and sensitivity of the petroleum sector in
Algeria, the Government and the Bank have agreed on a gradual but incremental
strategy for Bank involvement. This first project is therefore designed, as an
initial step, to address a selected number of key issues, while contributing to a
modest extent to the mobilization of SONATRACW's financing requirements.
Specifically, the issues of sector develooment sqtrategv and efficiency (including
the private sector's role) and human reso2rce development will be addressed under
the project through (i) technical and legal/contractual assistance designed to
help foster investment by foreign oil companies; (ii) a study of the
restructuring of the petroleum services subsector; (iii) the strengthening of
SONATRACH's planning capability and financial systems and the training of its
financial/managerial staff; and (iv) the strengthening of its technical
capabilities in the areas of enhanced oil recovery and drilling. In this
connection, the Bank's independent dialogue with international petroleum
companies has provided valuable inputs into the designing of th. project's
technical assistance component, and into the technical support already provided
to SONATRACH during project preparation.  The issue of gas utillzation will be
addressed, through the development, under the project, of a computerized model
for the optimization of long-term hydrocarbons development. Jngzrg PrihLng
issues have been addressed during project preparation, resulting in the
substantial price increases referred to above. Environmental issues will also be
addressed under the project; in particular, it will help SONATRACH implement a
comprehensive Environmental Plan of Action related to its drllling and production
operations, which has been prepared on the basis of an initial review carried out
by the Bank during appraisal. SONATRACH has also agreed under the loan to
discuss every year with the Bank its medium-term investment program and future
finances, which will provide an opportunity for the Bank to contribute to the
design of the sector's investment priorities and overall strategy.
8.          Subsequent operations would build upon and extend the policy focus of
the current project. To this end, they would concentrate on further improving
the structure of domestic hydrocarbons pricing (an issut which is also addressed
jointly by the Fund and the Bank in the context of their overall macroaconomic
dialogue), as well as rationalizing gas utilization and promoting energy
conservatlon. They will also follow up on the restructuring of SONATRACH and
other sector enterprises and hopefully would provide for direct private sector
involvement in order to maximize the Bank's catalytic role; this will be
facilitated by expected changes in the legal/contractual framework designed to
permit foreign investment in enhanced recovery projects, -;hich have been prepared
with the Bank's assistance. Finally, the Bank would promote future regional
energy projects, such as the planned gas pipeline between Algeria, Morocco and
Spain which may prove critical for the whole region's energy future; in this
connection, the Bank is already providing assistanre to Morocco, under the ESNAP
program, for a study of its future gas needs.
9.          Project Objectives and Justification.  The project's immediate
objectives are to: (i) help the Government and SONATRACH in their efforts to
attract iwmestments in exploration and development by foreign oil companies;
(ii) help improve the efficiency of the petroleum services subsector (and



- 4 -
particularly of drill:ng operations, the high cost of which has proved to be a
major financial drain on the company's budget); (iii) help SONATRACH optimize the
production of its oil and gas fields through enhanced oil recovery schemes; and
(iv) address outstanding environmental problems related to drilling and
production activities. All these will lead to very substantial and rapid foreign
earnings/savings. Moreover, the Bank will help SONATRACH mobilize incremental
funds through co-financing arrangements with Eximbank of Japan; more generally,
the Bank's direct involvement in the sector, although relatively small when
compared to the sector's overall financial requirements, is expected to be an
Important catalyst to SONATRACH's (and Algeria's) reeewed ability to enter the
international capital markets, by providing added comfort to potential commercial
lenders and foreign investors.
10.         Progegt Descrititol.  The proposed project scope includes:
(i)      technical assistance for the gromotion of exoloration acgeage to
foreign oil companies, including basin studies, the setting up of a
modern exploration data base, promotional and legal/contractual
support, and the services of a small number of high-level foreign
experts;
(ii)      a technical assistanL,/training program (provided by a major foreign
oil company' aimed at upgrading SONATRACH's drilling superyLsory
capabilities;
(iii)      studies and investments for three priority enhanced oil recovery
subprojects (in the Amassak, Kesdar and Zarzaitine fields); and
(iv)      studies. technical assi4tance. and training for, inter alia, the
restructuring of the petroleum services sutjector, environmental
management, planning optimization, and th upgrading of SONATRACH's
systems and data processing capabilitie:
11.         Prolect Cost and Financing. The estLmet-.d cost of the project is
US$240.2 million, with a foreign cost of US.171.1 million, to be financed by a
Bank loan of US$100 million, a cofinancing (untied) loan of about US$76.8 million
equivalent from Eximbank of Japan, and French bilateral aid (the latter for
component (Li)). Local costs would be covered by SONATRACH's internal funds and
domestic loans.  Procurement of Bank- and Eximbank-financed items would follow
Bank guidelines (mostly ICB for goods and services). The US$500,000 allocated to
the petroleum services subsector restructuring study will be on-lent by SONATRACH
to the Fonds de PArticipation MiUes Hydroc.arbreg Hydrauicgue, which will carry
out the study.V Retroactive financing would be allowed for up to US$10.0
million (102 of loan amount).
12.            ironmen ant. The project is expected to have a major posltive
environmental impact as it would initiate, for the first time, a comprehensive
process to address issues related to the environmental impact of petroleum
drilling and production operations in Algeria. The first step in this process
was an environmental review carried out by the Bank during project appraisal,
which led to the preparation by SONATRACH, in March 1991, of an Environmental

Action Plan. This plan addresses a range of technical, institutional and
organizational issues and proposes a two-phased program with the first phase (to
be completed by June 30, 1992), including, iln> a$ia, a comprehensive program of
data collection and assessment of impacts on groundwater, as well as a study of
alternative technologies and comparative costs for remedial action; selected
activities under this program will be funded by the loan. Given its strong
environmental dimension, the project has been rated 'B5.
13.         Main AgreMemnts Reached. Main agreements reached during loan
negotiations are: (i) a joint annual review (by June 30 of each year) of
SONATRACH's financial performance and prospects, and of its five-year investment
program; (ii) the achievement by SONATRACH of certain agreed annual debt-equity
and debt-service coverage ratios (and the obligation, in the event these ratios
are not met in any year, to submit within sixty days a satisfactory program of
measures aimed at bringing them back within stipulated limits); (iii) the
independent audit of SONATRACH's accounts starting with the accounts for fiscal
year 1991; (iv) the carrying out by SONATRACH of its Environmental Action Plan
and a joint review, by 30, 1992, of progress made in its implementation; and
(v) the carrying out by the Fonda de Particination Mines HYdrOcarbures
UydaJJigsa of a petroleum services subsector restructuring study.
14.         Project Benfits and Risks.  As already mentioned (para. 9), project
benefits will include an enhanced ability to attract and/or foster private
investments and financing, as well as improvements in *he sector's efficiency.
In addition, the enhanced oil recovery subprojects will be highly profitable
(with IRRs in excess of 40X) and would generate substantial foreign earnings.
Main risks associated with the oil recovery projects concern reservoir
performance, project implementation, and oil price uncertainty. These risks are
considered acceptable in light of (i) the detailed reservoir studies which have
been carried out; (ii) SONATRACHs extensive experience with secondary recovery
schemes and the technical assistance to be provided under the project; and (iii)
the fact that oil prices would have to decrease to unrealistic levels (below
US$5/BBL) for the projects to become uneconomic.
15.         Recomenato. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
