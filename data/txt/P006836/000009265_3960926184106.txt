MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO CENTRAL HIPOTECARIO
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR PROJECT
1. The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to Banco
Central Hipotecario (BCH), with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia, for
US$150 million equivalent is submitted for  approval.   The proposed loan would be
on standard IBRD term with 17 years maturity, including 5 years of grace and would
help finance a Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Project.
2. Background: About 40? of Colombia's population still lacks access to piped
water and about 60? does not have adequate seweragelsanitation facilities.
Service remains particularly deficient in smaller cities, towns and rural areas.
The shortcomings of the water supply and sewerage sector in Colombia stem largely
from the absence of an appropriate sectoral policy framework and the weakness of
the National Institute for Urban Development (INSFOPAL), the technical and
financial lead agency for the urban subsector for the past three decades, in
guiding and supporting sector development. In particular, INSFOPAL was unable to
use the provision of credit as a means for promoting the institutional and
financial strengthening of sector companies. With few exceptions, these companies
continue to be poorly managed and to suffer from chronic financial short-falls
because of inadequate tariff levels, inefficient operations and over-ambitious
investments.
3.  The  current  1988-1992  sector  investment  program  (about  US$820  million)
includes primarily investments in the large cities of Bogota, Cali and Medellin.
To alleviate poverty by providing better social infrastructure services, the
Government has decided to invest an additional US$600 million over 1988-1992 to
improve water supply and sewerage services in communities predominantly outside
the large cities. Conscious of the past poor performance by sector institutions,
the Government is undertaking a Sector Reform Program (SRP) which introduces: (a)
sweeping changes in sector organization in support of its decentralization policy
which transfers the responsibilities for providing water and sewerage services to
municipal governments; (b) a new financing policy emphasizing investment contribu-
tions from operating companies, local governments and domestic credit and reduced
reliance on external loans and subsidies from the national budget; and (c) a sec-
tor lending policy with conditionality to commit operating companies to improve
their efficiency and financial performance.
4. The organizational changes, mandated in Decree 77 of 1987, include: (a) the'
abolishment of INSFOPAL; (b) the  transfer  of sector management from the Ministry
of Health to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT) and within MOPT the
creation of a Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS) as the sector's
technical regulatory and support agency; (c) the transformation of the INSFOPAL
owned regional and municipal operating companies into autonomous departmental,
regional or municipal utilities; and (d) the designation of the Urban Development
Fund (FFDU) of BCH as the primary intermediary for future sector investments.
Over the past twenty years, FFDU has developed into Colombia's most efficient and
important 'ender for municipal  infrastructure  projects.   In preparation for its
enlarged role in the water supply and sewerage sector, FFDU is strengthening its
organization, staff and operating procedures.



-2-
.  Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed Project would contribute to some
of the most Important objectives of the Bank's country strategy, including
rationalizing investments, improving public expenditure management and control,
stimulating domestic resource mobilization and assisting the country in its
efforts to alleviate poverty. Since 1968, the Bank has made 12 loans totalling
US$425 million for water  supply  and  sewerage  investments.   PCRs for completed
projects concluded that loan beneficiaries largely achieved physical objectives,
but often were unable to reach institutional and financial targets. Three multi-
city loans to INSPOPAL were unsuccessful in achieving the policy improvements
necessary for  efficient  sector  growth.    With  the  adoption  of  the SRP, the
Government is addressing these shortcomings. The Bank assisted in the development
of the SRP and its continued support would help assure that the reform momentum is
sustained. The sector loan approach would be continued in the future to deepen
the sector adjustments being initiated by the Government.
6.  Project Obiectives.   The  proposed  Project  would  assist  the Government in
implementing the first stage of  the  SRP.    Specifically, it wouldt  (a) provide
water supply services to about 1.9 million and sewerage services to about 1.3
million, mostly poor people; (b) help introduce the lending and financial policies
adopted under the SRP; (c) strengthen sector institutions on the national and
local levels; (d) promote more cost effective and appropriate investment projects;
and (e) establish a permanent training capacity for sector personnel.
7.  Project Description:  The Project would supports  (A) a line of credit to BCH/
FPDU for the financing of about 80 subprojects, involving the rehabilitation and
expansion of water supply and sewerage systems in about 400 communities,
improvement of solid waste services in about 10 cities and institutional
strengthening of project executing  agencies;  BCH/FFDU   would be responsible for
the identification, appraisal and supervision of these subprojects; BCHIFFDU's
funds would be on-lent through commercial financial institutions which would
assume the credit risk; (B) a program for strengthening FFDU's operating capacity;
(C) a program for strengthening DWSS' capacity and the executiorn by DWSS of
studies to improve norms and procedures for the design of sector projects; and (D)
the establishment of a national training center (CENAGUAS) and the execution of
training programs to benefit sector staff of about 8000. The total cost of the
Project is estimated at US$435 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$150 million.   A  break-down  of  costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Colombia are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7120-CO
dated May 26, 1988, is also attached.
8. Agreed Actions. The Government has agreed tot (a) cause BCH/PFDU to set
variable interest rates pegged to the market-based Certificate of Deposit rate and
sufficient to cover the costs of funds and administrative expenses; (b) an annual
review with BCH/FFDU and the Bank of the sector's five-year investment program and
progress in meeting the institutional and financial targets of the SRP and the
Project and the taking of any remedial actions found necessary by the review;
(c) implement a system to monitor performance of sector companies and, beginning
at the end of 1989, publish annual reports on such performance; (d) cause DWSS to
complete its establishment as a functional unit by June 30, 1989 and to execute
Component D in accordance with a plan of action satisfactory to the Bank;
(e) designate BCH/FFDU as primary intermediary for the financing of sector
projects; and (f) carry out sector development in accordance with the objectives
and policies of the SRP as described in its policy letter dated May 5, 1988. In
addition, the Government and BCH have  a2reed that thR  anv-nm-y   -..tA 



-3-
BCH for losses arising from future devaluations in excess of domestic price
increases. The agreement spelling out the mechanisms for such compensation would
be concluded before Loan signature.
9. BCHIFFDU has agreed to adopt an Operating Manual Statement satisfactory to the
Bank establishing the conditionality for subprojects to be supported under the
SRP. The Statement would: (a) limit loan financing by BCH/FFDU to 802 of total
subproject cost; (b) specify upper limits for the provision of equity contribu-
tions from Government; and (c) require project executing agencies to: (i) demons-
trate adequate managerial, financial and operational autonomy and capacity; (ii)
achieve pre-established operational and financial performance targets; (iii)
obtain prior approval by the Tariff Board for the implementation of tariff levels
sufficient to achieve financial performance targets; (iv) execute institutional
strengthening programs; and (v) present sound investment projects. BCH/FFDU has
also agreed to: (a) carry out an institutional strengthening program in accordance
with a plan of action agreed with the Bank; and (b) enter into an agreement with
CENAGUAS providing for CENAGUAS to become functional by March 31, 1989 and to
carry out Component D in accordance with a plan of action satisfactory to the
Bank.
10. Special conditions  of  effectiveness  would  be:    (a)  the  adoption of the
Operating Manual Statement by BCH/FFDU; (b) the presentation of satisfactory
standard sub-lending documents and (c) agreements satisfactory to the Bank,
between: (i) BCH/FFDU and the National Fund for Development Projects (FONADE) to
establish a fund for financing pre-investment studies; (ii) BCH/FPDU and MOPT
regarding the on-lending of loan funds for the execution of Component C; and (iii)
BCH/FFDU and CENAGUAS regarding the execution of Component D.
11. Benefits. The Project would directly benefit some 3.2 million, mostly low-
income people with new water supply and/or sewerage connections and provide asso-
ciated improvements in public health and standard of living. Economic benefits
for individual subprojects would substantially exceed 1OZ which is the minimum
acceptable internal rate of return  for  SRP  subprojects.   SRP would benefit the
country's economy by stimulating sector savings through efficiency gains in the
operation of sector companies and the formulation of more cost-effective and
technologically appropriate investment projects.
12. Risks. The reform of the sector's institutional and policy framework is ambi-
tious and complex, and will require a sustained effort in the years ahead. The
main risks include the possibility of: (a) political pressures undermining the
strong conditionality now introduced; (b) unwillingness of small municipalities to
form viable regional water utilities; (c) instability in the management of project
executing agencies; and (d) deficient management of the Project by BCHIFFDU. The
Project includes specific measures to help minimize these risks. An annual review
of important Project and Program issues would lead to timely plans of action to
remedy  identified  shortcomings.      To   ensure   adherence  to  the  subproject
conditionality,  the  Bank  would  review  all  subprojects,  prior  to  approving
disbursements. Another risk is introduced by the Government's plan of converting
FFDU of BCH into an autonomous Territorial Development Bank. If the Colombian
Congress were to approve this plan, the intermediary arrangements for the Project
would change. The risk associated with such changes would be mitigated by the
fact that the Bank would have the right of approval of any new intermediary
arrangements. Nevertheless, the introduction of these arrangements might delay
project execution. Considering the magnitude and complexity of the
reform process being undertaken by the Government, it is likely that not all of



-4-
the project objectives will be fully  met.   Even so, the Project would contribute
significantly to the development of a much more robust and efficient water supply
and sewerage sector in Colombia.
13. Rtcommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Loan.
