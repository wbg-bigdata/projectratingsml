MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE rRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN
EDUCATION REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed Development Credit to the
Cenitral African Republic (CAR) for SDR 14.1 million (US$18.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would assist in
financing quantitative improvement in primary and higher education, and
strengthening and improving education sector management.
2.        Back-round.  The CAR9s education system accounts for 25% of the
total Government Budget, employs one-third of all civil servants, and has
achieved wide coverage at moderate -.osts. The adult literacy rate in 1985
was estimated at 40%, while primary enrollments (of which 36% are girls)
grew annually by 5.8% in 1980-85, bringing the gross enrollment ratio to
78%. At 15,000 CFAF (US$48 equivalent), or 18Z of GDP p.c., unit costs per
pupillyear compare favorably with the average for frsncophone Africa (23%).
However, three critical issues affect education: (a) poor quality and low
internal efficiency (especially at the primary level) which impedes
progress throughout the educational system; (b) weak management and
planning capacity; and (c) poor resource allocation, exacerbated by
financial ,nstraints, which has skewed the expenditure pattern to favor
non-educational subsidies.
3.        Poor educational quality and low internal efficiency at the
primary level may be traced to: (a) inadequate teachers' skills; (b) p'oor
school management; (c) insufficient books and classroom supplies; (d) a
deteriorating school environment where 601 of primary classrooms require
renovation while the remaining 402 require replacement; (e) infrequent
school inspection; and (f) large class-sizes due to inefficient school
timetables. Thus, with poor learning conditions and limited selectivity,
student repetition and drop-out is very high (average rates of about 33%
and 12%), and it takes 24 years of instruction to produce a primary school
graduate (vs. a theoretical six years), placing the CAR education system
among the least efficient in the world. Weaknesses in administration
include: (i) poor personnel management; (ii) a lack of coherent and
systematically applied financial management, accounting and budgeting
procedures; (iii) limited capacity for physical planning; and (iv) an
information system restricted by poor data collection and analysis. In
addition, the sector expenditure pattern by level and nature is distorted
with the budgetary allocation for primary education falling (from 63% of
sector expenditures in 1982 to 49% in 1986) while those for secondary and
higher education have risen (from 8% to 17% and from 22% to 24% of sector
expenditures respectively). While salaries have been the dominant type of
expense (80% of total sector expenditures), transfer payments, in the form
of scholarships, have nevertheless accounted for 67% of higher education
expenditures, or 16% of the total sector budget. In addition, over one
half of scholarships expenditure goes to students abroad thereby starving



- 2 -
the University of Bangui of resources and encouraging unnecessary overseas
studies. At all levels of education, pedagogical inputs and materials have
received only 2S of the sector budget, well below the minimum needed to
ensure effective use of the teaching staff.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The thrust of IDA's country
strategy is the provision of coherent and consistent support to maximise
the impact of the Government's structural adjustment program. Issues
dir)ctly relating to the education sector were not explicitly contained in
the structural adjustment program. However this project, with its joint
annual review of an agreed action plan, will address the critical policy
issues in the sector in a manner which complements the adjustment program.
In education, the Government has a two-pronged strategy aimed for the
long-term at: (a) improving quality (starting at the primary level) while
increasing relevance to the needs of CAR's economy and society; and (b)
strengthening the management and administration of the sector through
decentralization while mobilizing the support of all the parties involved.
This strategy makes sense in that it addresses the key issues in a rational
way, allowing for a gradual lifting of the present financial, human and
physical constraints. IDA has been asked to help the Government define a
global and long-term framework for the development of the sector and to
identify the policy reforms necessary for cost effective resource
allocation and investment in education. Through ' a involvement, IDA would
help coordinate other aid eftorts, primarily through improvements in sector
resource planning, budgeting and management, a main goal of the project.
So far, IDA's assistance has been instrumental in providing a policy and
institutional framework for an educational rehabilitation program which has
guided actions of other agencies and is coherent with the activities of the
major bilateral donors France. Continuation of this involvement is
important for ensuring a balanced development of the sector consistent with
the structural adjustment program.
5.        Proiect Objectives.  The overall objectives of the project are to
assist the Government to: (a) raise the quality and efficiency of primary
schooling with a program of rehabilitation; and (b) develop the sector
managerial capacity at all levels of education for more effective use of
resources. To this end, by introducing expenditure control on
scholarships, improving resource management and extending the public
administration reform to the education sector, the project would ensure
that, within the context of its structural adjustment programs (i)
sufficient resources are available for the qualitative improvements and
increased managerial capacity which are the project's key objectives; and
(ii) these resources are optimally allocated and private participation
increased.
6.        Project Description.  The project contains components to improve
the quality of inputs into the education process, and also components to
improve sector management. Quality improvement would be addressed through:
(a) in-service retrainirng of primary teachers and education administrators;
(b) an increased supply of basic primary textbooks; (c) a community based
program of renovation, replacement and repair of primary classrooms in
three zones; (d) strengthening primary school inspectorates and
reorganizing the school timetable to reduce class size; and (e) improving



- 3 -
study facilities at the University of Bangui library and science faculty.
Sector management improvement would be addressed through: (f) strengthening
personnel, financial and physical resource management with office
improvements, microcomputers and training; (g) reinforcing project
implementation capacity; (h) supporting the National Scholarship Service;
and (i) strengthening the University planning function. As part of
component (a), the project -.ould include a health education program. As
part of eomponents (h) and (i), the project would finance studies needed to
prepare the revised higher education scholarship system and a development
plan for the university. The studies would include, among others, an
analysis of the relationship between the labor market and the education
system, and the allocation of scholarships by quota to address:
distribution by subject areas and level of studies, in the CAR or abroad,
and disadvantaged groups (women and rural families). Under the project, to
be implemented over a si- year period, a three-year rolling action plan
containing annual budgetary, scholarship and staffing targets would be
monitored each year at a joint Government/IDA review.
7.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$20.7 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$11.9 million of 57%.
The r oject provides funds for civil works; furniture; equipment; education
materials; technical assistance; training; and incremental operating costs.
The role of technical assistance is to provide training and assistance in
key areas of institutional development, project managemert and regional
building coordination; areas in which local expertise is limited. High
costs cf international assistance have been avoided by the use of NGO
volunteers for building coordination. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
The timetable of key projec.t processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the CAR are given in Schedule C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6835-CA dated October 19,
1987 is being distributed separately.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that at the joint
annual review it would examine with IDAs the .ction plan; its interim
annual targets; the education sector recurrent budget; the public
investment program for education; and project implementation (specifically:
the in-service training plan, the annual classroom rehabilitation and
maintenance program, and the personnel plan). The action plan would be
related to the annual Government/IDA review of the total public investment
program and public expenditure program undertaken under the SAL and would
include: (a) monitoring annually the proportion of the Government recurrent
budget allocated to the education sector; (b) raising expenditures on
primary education by 1.2 percentage points p.a. from 52% to at least 60%,
and on materials by 0.8 percentage points p.a. from 2% to at least 8% of
the education sector recurrent budget by 1994; (c) reducing Government
expenditure on scholarships by 1.4 percentage points p.a. from 16% to 8% of
the education sector budget by 1994, and focusing it on key scientific,
technological and managerial fields; (d) reducing the proportion of
non-teachers in the total education staff, through staff redeployment, from
11% to 7% over the life of the project; and (e) incorporating, in the
annual budget law, the budgetary targets agreed with IDA during the annual



joint review and monitoring their implementation. Prior to effectiveness
the Government would have: (i) appointedI the Deputy Director and short-term
procurement specialist for the Project Coordination Unit; and (li) signed
major technical assistance contracts (the managing consultant for
textbooks, and regional coordinators -- volur.teers -- for classroom
rehabilitation). Continued disBursement under the credit would be
conditional upon agreement each year between the Government and IDA on the
contents of the action pian and the satisfactory joint review of progress
made in implementing this action plan.
9.        Justification.  The project would promote improved quality and
relevance of inputs and better resource management, resulting in more
efficient operation, reduced costs/graduate, and increased pupil
achievement. At the primary level, it is expected that these improvements
would translate into a reduction of the dropout and repeater rates by as
much as 302, and a 40% decline in the costs/graduate. The project would
ensure a closer qualitative and quantitative match between the output of
the education system and the needs of the economy especially at the
post-secondiry level. A more efficient allocation of resources, combined
with better managemernt, would reinforce, at the sector level, the
Government's structural adjustment program.
10.       Risks.  The project has two main risks.  First, the CAR has no
experience of complex sectoral projects in the field of education. To
ensure that the sector budgetary targets set out in the Action Plan are
acted upon, the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning would participate
in the annual review process. In addition, implementation problems arising
from the complexity of the project are addressed by staggering the actions
envisaged for both institutional development and the physical
rehabilitation of schools. Second, at present the CAR education sector
suffers from weak financial management, planning and budgeting, and ongoing
projects encounter delays in the provision of counterpart funds. The
project has been designed to alleviate this situation with a carefully
planned approach of Government to sector rehabilitation; by the increased
participation of local communities with labor and local inputs; by
short-term consultancy services in financial management; and by the
training program for the national team in project management.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agree'nent of the Association and recommend that
the Executi-;e Directors approve the proposed credit.
