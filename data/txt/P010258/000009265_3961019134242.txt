MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Pakdstan
Sixth Agricultural Development Bank Project
(Loan 2693-PAK and Credit 1699-PAK)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Pakistan-Sixth
Agricultural Development Bank project (Loan 2693-PAK and Credit 1699-PAK, approved in
FY86), prepared by the South Asia Regional Office. Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
The principal objective of the project was to further strengthen the Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) as an effective and self-sustaining lending
institution-capable of reaching an increasing proportion of the rural community-by financing a
time slice of its operations. The ADBP was to provide loans to farmers for medium- and long-
term agricultural investments, while expanding the share of its lending going to smaller farmers.
The US$165 million Loan and US$45 million equivalent Credit were expected to cover 13 percent
of total project costs and be fully committed in three years.
The PCR-a good, balanced document-describes ADBP's successful lending
performance in which the financing of tractors and equipment maintained a dominant though
declining share of total investments. The small farmer targets were exceeded. Re-estimates of
the financial and economic rates of return for appraisal farm models show values similar to the
high rates originally projected. However, the PCR documents in detail the deterioration of key
financial and institutional indicators, especially after 1990. Sub-loan recovery rates fell from 73
percent to 45 percent between 1985 and 1993: compared with a minimum recovery target of 81
percent by 1989 set at appraisal. The number of loans and lending volumes declined as ADBP
unsuccessfully tried to reverse the trend to higher delinquency. The PCR identifies the loss of
stable and strong leadership at ADBP as one of the factors explaining the decline in performance.
The PCR concludes that ADBP is neither financially self-sustaining, nor becoming so. The Bank
and its cofinanciers cancelled undisbursed loan funds for the follow-on operation in June 1994.
Despite impressive on-farm achievements, the project outcome is rated as
unsatisfactory, institutional development as negligible and sustainability as unlikely.
A cluster audit is planned for this and the follow-on operation.

SIXTH AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
(Ln. 2693-PAK, Cr. 1699-PAK)
PREFACE
1.         This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth Agricultural Development Bank
Project (ADBP-VI) for which Loan 2693-PAK in the amount of US$165 million and Credit 1699-PAK
in the amount of SDR 47.6 million (US$55 million equivalent) were approved on May 15, 1986. The
Loan was fully disbursed by the original closing date (June 30, 1991). After two extensions (by one year
and six months, respectively), the final credit closing date was December 31, 1992. The credit account
was kept open until April 30, 1993, to accommnodate final withdrawal applications. With the last
disbursement made on May 18, 1993, the credit was also fully disbursed.
2.         The PCR, except Part II, was prepared by an FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program
mission, which visited Pakistan in April 1994, and reviewed by the Agriculture and Natural Resources
Operations Division, Country Department I, South Asia Region. Preparation was based on a review of
the Staff Appraisal Report and legal documents, supervision reports and project files; a draft PCR
prepared by the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP); field visits; and discussions with
officers of ADBP and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), beneficiaries, and Bank staff associated with the
project. Part II was prepared by ADBP for the Borrower.

PAKISTAN
SIXTH AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
(Ln. 2693-PAK, Cr. 1699-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.         The Bank's association with the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) dates
back to a Credit (Cr. 76-PAK) in the amount of US$27 million, signed in June 1965. By mid-1986, the
Bank's lending to ADBP totalled nearly US$375 million through what became a series of six loans/credits.
In addition to the lending programs, increasing emphasis was placed on the institutional development of
ADBP.
Objectives
2.         Designed as a 'traditional' credit project, the two principal objectives of the Sixth Agricultural
Development Bank Project in Pakistan were to: (i) further strengthen ADBP as an effective and self-
sustaining lending institution capable of reaching an increasing proportion of the rural community; and
(ii) increase farm productivity and farmers' incomes through the provision of credit and related technical
support under ADBP's mobile credit officer (MCO) scheme.
3.         These objectives were to be achieved by: (i) improving the efficiency of credit delivery
through the MCO scheme; (ii) enhancing ADBP's ability to cater to the needs of small farmers; and (iii)
developing ADBP's capacity to lend effectively in specific priority areas (tractors, implements, private
minor irrigation) through training and technical assistance.
Implementation Experience
4.         The project became effective in September 1986, about three months after loan/credit signing.
Disbursements were generally ahead of appraisal estimates for most of the project period, with the Bank
loan fully disbursed by the original closing date (June 30, 1991) while the IDA credit experienced delays
mainly in disbursement for vehicles and the closing date was extended twice from June 1991 to December
1992. The credit was also fully disbursed. At completion, project costs exceeded appraisal estimates by
60% in Pakistan rupees due to the longer implementation period, coupled with an average inflation rate
of 9% rather than 7.5% expected at appraisal, and a significant depreciation of the Pakistan rupee.
5.         During the implementation period, total term lending and short-term loans financed by ADBP
showed a low annual growth of 3% compared to the appraisal estimate of 25% p.a. There was a 27%
expansion in FY88, which steadily fell to 8% in FY90. Since FY90, total lending declined by 11% in
FY91 and 16% in FY92, largely due to stricter lending criteria, greater attention to loan recovery and
cutbacks in SBP funding. The share of lending for tractors in ADBP's total lending dropped considerably
from 43% in FY87 to 25% in FY92, thus leading to significant improvements in the diversification of
ADBP's loan portfolio. The channelling of an increasing share of ADBP funds to small farms (below 25
ac) met or even exceeded the agreed targets of 75%, and nearly 50% or more of funds went to farms of
less than 12.5 ac.



- iv -
6.         These achievements have, however, been accompanied by some serious short-comings. First,
overdues are high and loan recovery has been low and falling, largely as a result of rapid credit expansion
without due attention to the quality of loans. While rapid growth in disbursements (prior to 1989) and
rescheduling policies (since then) have helped to diminish arrears as a percentage of the portfolio, they also
have masked the true state of portfolio quality. Almost 25% of ADBP's portfolio was affected by arrears
in 1993, before reschedulement (of PRs 6,134 million) or 12% after reschedulement. Loan recovery rates
(before reschedulement) declined steadily from 67% in FY87 to 44% in FY93. Low recovery has been
caused by borrowers' low and variable income, poor sub-project selection, inappropriate loan amount and
inadequate follow-up by branch staff and MCOs. In addition, political interference, remission of interest
payments from time to time as well as willful default continue to play a major role. Also, there are
insufficient incentives or penalties to induce timely repayments; borrowers who default take little risk, bank
staff receive the same rewards whether they make good or bad loans. Secondly, the low financial spreads
in the face of high provisions for possible loan losses are insufficient to cover the full cost of lending.
While ADBP has been reporting profits in recent years, it is actually incurring losses if real bad debt
provisions and interest income reversal were properly reflected in its accounts. As a result, the financial
viability of ADBP is in question.
7.         The other outstanding problems include the avoidable costs of unprofitable branches (which
could be minimized by closing unviable branches and merging others to make them viable), undue
concentration of risks in certain sectors (e.g., tractors), Government's resistance to increases in agricultural
interest rates, low deposit base and the concomitant dependence on SBP for funding. ADBP has
deteriorated to a point where its ability to respond to the growing needs of agricultural clients is
increasingly in doubt.
Project Results
8.         The principal objectives of the project have not been fully achieved. Although the Bank
appropriately placed increasing emphasis on ADBP's institutional development, weaknesses in its financial
structure caused largely by declining loan recovery rates continued to be an obstacle to successful
strengthening of the bank through the project period. On the other hand, ADBP has made a substantial,
though declining, contribution to the financing of farm investments during the period under review.
Between 1987 and 1992, it expanded its network from 235 branches and 36 regional offices to 332
branches and 48 regional offices. The number of staff benefiting from the training program totalled 10,000
for locally conducted training courses and 39 for overseas training. The MIS was consolidated and
upgraded. Some progress was also made in monitoring and evaluation.
9.         As a result of the sharp increase in overdues, ADBP experienced a shortage of liquidity,
which was partly overcome by soft loans from IBRD/IDA, the Asian Development Bank and OECF.
ADBP was able to reschedule loans in arrears and continue to expand its portfolio until FY90. Since then,
its lending declined and its dues to SBP were further delayed. After FY87, implementation of a more
prudent provisioning policy revealed the extent of ADBP's hidden losses. ADBP currently lends at rates
that are positive in real terms, although they are below market rates and inadequate to cover the full cost
of lending.
10.        Re-estimated financial rates of return range from 14% to 51 %, compared to 18% to 49% at
appraisal, whereas re-estimated economic rates of return range from 25% to 60%, compared to 22% to
50% at appraisal. This indicates that most investments could have supported loans at market rates of
interest, and that the overall rate of investment would probably not have been lower in the absence of
administered interest rates. Some investments with low returns, such as tractors on rainfed farms, might
not have been made without the preferential interest rates.



Sustainability
11.        ADBP's sustainability depends mainly on significant improvement in the loan recovery rate.
This rate steadily declined from 67% (FY87) to 44% (FY93). Following the floods of 1992, 53% of
ADBP's overdues were rescheduled in FY93. ADBP mounted a series of ineffective loan recovery drives.
Unless the recovery rate improves, ADBP's move towards sustainability would be delayed. A subsidy
dependence index calculated for ADBP shows that reliance on subsidies fell from 52% to 46% between
FY87 and FY91 but rose to 57% in FY92. While such progress is encouraging, prospects for ADBP's
long-run sustainability remain dim.
Lessons Learned
12.        The main lessons learned from the implementation experience of the project are as follows:
(i)    The critical importance of stable, strong and capable leadership on a continuing basis
is demonstrated by the experience of ADBP, which had six chairmen between 1987 and 1992. While there
can be a role for short-term consultants, they cannot substitute for local management. Building good
institutions begins with continuity of strong management.
(ii)    The case of ADBP confirms, a lesson often learnt, that institution-building is a slow
process, the pace of which must be generated within the institution itself if it is to be sustained, and that
assistance which can be given by external agencies like the Bank, while at times valuable, also has clear
limitations. This is especially so in staffing and management.
(iii)    ADBP's experience, which is matched by many similar cases in South Asia, suggests
that it is preferable to have agricultural banks that are closely integrated into a country's financial system
rather than institutions given such a specialized position as ADBP. The risk is that the bank grows into
a complacent bureaucracy rather than a development-oriented, competitive business organization.
(iv)    The Bank should take a firmer position regarding the financial performance of the
banks, insisting on satisfactory results as a precondition for (continued) lending. The Bank should always
receive a thorough, independent audit report on the institution's financial position including its loan
portfolio before lending to it.
(v)    In designing repeater projects like the Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 3226-PAK
and Cr. 2153-PAK), it would have been desirable to avoid the overlap with the preceding sixth project,
which reduced the opportunity of learning from the implementation experience of that project.
(vi)    Poor profitability of agricultural banks in general, and ADBP in particular, is the
result of administered, subsidized interest rates to borrowers which do not pass on the full cost of lending.
In addition, ADBP incurs losses due to non-accrual of interest on overdue loans while paying interest on
dues to SBP, and interest remissions on bank loans introduced by Government from time to time without
reimbursement. It is likely that interest rates are subsidized without full appreciation of the costs and effect
on ADBP viability.

2. Background
2.1        Pakistan is dependent on the flow of external resources to augment national savings. A
significant part of this flow has come from the Bank Group, largely in the form of concessional credits
from IDA but with loans from the Bank increasing as IDA resources became limited. By mid-1986, both
the Bank and IDA had made cumulative commitments of US$4.4 billion to Pakistan. This amount
included lending to ADBP totalling US$374.8 million (or 9% of total commitments) between 1965 and
1986, through six credits/loans. The agricultural credit portfolio is thus a significant part of the Bank
Group's agricultural program in Pakistan since 1965. Until the seventh lending operation approved in
1990, the six previous credits/loans followed a similar pattern of objectives: financing of farm
investments, transfer of external resources to Pakistan, and development of ADBP as an institution. The
sixth operation, the subject of this report, became effective in September 1986. It provided US$165
million in loan and US$55 million equivalent in credit funds - almost four times the loan/credit size of
the fifth project - aimed at continuing the institutional development of ADBP and at increasing farm
productivity and farmers' incomes by supporting ADBP's lending program through its mobile credit
officers scheme. All six operations funded only investments and not seasonal inputs.
2.2        Until 1989, Bank lending for agriculture concentrated on strengthening the operations of
ADBP, the major source of agricultural credit in Pakistan. The Agricultural Credit Project, which is the
seventh in the series, was appraised in June/July 1989. In line with the Bank's recent strategy to move
away from supporting a single financial institution, this project has sought to improve the rural financial
system as a whole and complement the reform measures pursued under the Financial Sector Adjustment
Loan (Ln. 3029-PAK). The key implication is that financial sector lending should not only provide
needed credit to the real sectors but also simultaneously serve as a catalyst for the development of the
financial sector, thereby enhancing the Bank's role in promoting sound policies and institutions in the
financial sector.



3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1         The two principal objectives of the project were to: (i) further strengthen ADBP as an
effective and self-sustaining lending institution capable of reaching an increasing proportion of the rural
community; and (ii) increase farm productivity and farmer incomes through the provision of credit and
related technical support under ADBP's mobile credit officer (MCO) scheme. To achieve these
objectives, the project was designed to: (i) improve the efficiency of credit delivery through an expanded
MCO scheme that would focus on quality of lending; (ii) enhance ADBP's ability to cater to the needs
of small farmers through more intensive area coverage by MCOIs (mobile credit officers for intensified
schemes); (iii) further improve ADBP's capacity to lend effectively for priority investments, such as
tractor-drawn implements and private minor irrigation, and lend for investment packages that promote
the adoption of improved farm practices; and (iv) provide, through ADBP, loans to farmers for medium
and long-term agricultural investments during FY87-89 in farm mechanization, implements and
equipment, private minor irrigation, dairy development, poultry and other livestock, orchards, vegetables,
minor crops and other on-farm development.
3.2         The project was estimated to cost PRs 29,528 million or US$1,671 million, based on
ADBP's projected three-year lending program for FY87-89 extended to 41½ years in accordance with
ADBP's disbursement profile. Against this, an IBRD loan of US$165 million and an IDA credit of
SDR 47.6 million (US$55 million equivalent) were negotiated in March 1986. The legal agreements were
signed in May 1986 and the loan and credit became effective in September 1986.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1         The basic project design and the implementation arrangements were similar to those of the
fifth project. However, the project took into consideration lessons learned during the implementation of
previous projects. These were: (i) the deterioration of ADBP's financial position and the failure to
achieve institutional goals (third project); (ii) the successful MCO system, the successful expansion of
small farm lending, improved credit recovery, the interest rate subsidy to ADBP from Government and
the disappointing mechanization field trials (fourth project); and (iii) expansion in lending and changed
composition along lines intended, with a lower share for tractors and increased lending to small farms,
strengthening of ADBP largely as a result of its taking the necessary steps identified during project
preparation and appraisal, expansion of the MCO system and satisfactory financial rates of return to farm
investments (fifth project).
4.2         The main issues identified during appraisal of the sixth project were: (i) Islamization of
the ADBP lending operation and on-lending to ADBP; (ii) continued financing of tractors under the
project; and (iii) financing of vehicles. To overcome negative income effects from Islamic banking,
ADBP was required to charge rates of return or other charges based on Islamic modes of financing that
would be positive in real terms and sufficient to cover its total operating expenses and possible provisions
for bad debts, with level of provisions to total overdues at 40% or more, and accumulate reserves that
would be adequate to ensure, in conjunction with contributions by SBP to paid-in capital, that the ratio
of debt to equity is not greater than 7:1. The tractor issue was resolved by limiting project lending for
tractors to farmers with 25 ac or less on the grounds that tractorization may not have caused involuntary
unemployment as much as voluntary substitution of leisure for family labor inputs. The vehicles issue
was resolved by requiring procurement under ICB.
4.3         With hindsight it is clear that a gap in the appraisal process was the lack of sufficient
attention to the ambitious projected lending growth (25 % p.a.), which outpaced management capabilities
of ADBP, a lesson which should have become clear with continuing problems on loan recovery. There



- 3 -
was a broad assumption that loan recovery measures introduced under ADBP-V (annual case-by-case
reviews of overdues, policy on write-offs, and policy of making provisions for bad debts) would enhance
recovery rates as projected under the sixth project. The alarming rise in the level of overdues during the
FY87-92 period made this assumption unrealistic, delaying implementation of a clearly focused action
plan (later to be introduced under the follow-up project). In addition, the bias in favor of lending at the
expense of savings was continued by ADBP during the project period.
4.4        The sixth project was prepared by ADBP with the assistance of consultants and appraised
by the Bank in August/September 1985. As appraised, the project, like its predecessor, aimed at
continuing the institutional development of ADBP and at increasing farm productivity and farmers'
incomes by supporting ADBP's lending program through its MCO scheme. The relevance of these
measures is reflected in the Bank's continued concern for small farmer clientele and the economic
justification of tractorization. The increase in the number of MCOs envisaged under the sixth project
between 1987 and 1992 is an indication of ADBP's role in facilitating access of small farmers to short-
term credit and term loans, improving the quality of the loan portfolio and its recovery levels. As
regards lending for tractors, the Bank has followed up with a deliberate effort to keep the potential for
labor displacement under review. As in ADBP-V, the sixth project limited eligibility for tractor
refinancing to loans made to farmers with 25 ac or less, and provided for continued monitoring of its
impact.
4.5        Timing of the project was opportune as the fifth project was scheduled to close in June
1986. The implementation arrangements have followed a pattern established under previous projects.
ADBP, as and when needed, was expected to increase its headquarters and field staff, and streamline its
organizational structure and lending procedures in order to process expansion in lending volume.
Considering that these adjustments had been made as required in the past, it might have been reasonable
to assume that the projected lending targets would be achieved, but not the loan recovery which required
improved systems and management as much as good lending decisions.
5. Project Implementation
5.1        General Performance. The sixth loan/credit became effective in September 1986, about
three months after signature. By June 30, 1991, the loan was fully disbursed. After a 1 ½h year extension
of the closing date, to December 31, 1992, the credit was also fully disbursed.
5.2        ADBP's sources of low-cost funds had been the key instrument in its rapid expansion in
terms of organization, coverage and lending in Pakistan. The various organizational units of ADBP in
FY92 included its headquarters, 48 regional offices and 332 branches where over 8,600 employees
provided credit services including loan disbursements. The mobile credit system expanded from coverage
of 39,576 villages in FY87 to about 43,930 villages in FY92, although at 1,454 the number of MCOs
was lower (by 9%) in FY92 than the SAR target of 1,590. For general credit lending, the number of
borrowers declined from 120,944 in FY87 to 97,655 in FY92, compared with a target of 150,000, partly
due to the increased size of loans from PRs 44,300 to PRs 66,650. The lending growth rate was higher
at 27% in FY88 than planned at appraisal (25% p.a.) but dropped to 12% in FY89, 8% in FY90, -11 %
in FY91 and -16% in FY92. The slower growth during the FY89-92 period was attributed largely to
cutbacks in SBP funding and linkage of disbursement with recovery.
5.3        The annual growth of total loan disbursements over the 1987-92 period continued to
diversify in response to borrower demand. Tractor loans, which expanded by 29% between 1984 and
1987 accounting for nearly 43% of total lending in FY87, decelerated (because of marked increases in
tractor prices), falling to 25% in FY92. Short-term lending progressively increased its share in total



lending from 19% in FY87 to 43% in FY92. This exceeded the ceiling of 20% targeted at appraisal in
all years except in FY87. The bank's customer base was broadened during the project period to improve
lending to smaller farmers. About 79% of its term loans (excluding project loans) in FY92 were
provided to farmers with up to 25 ac of land, and within this total nearly 49% were provided to farmers
holding under 12.5 ac, thus exceeding or almost meeting the targets set at appraisal (75% and 50%,
respectively).
5.4         However, these achievements were accompanied by some serious shortcomings. First,
overdues are high and loan recovery has been low and falling, a reflection of poor (past) lending. In
addition, political interference, interest remission from time to time, as well as willful default continue
to play a major role. Secondly, the low financial spreads in the face of high provisions for possible loan
losses are insufficient to cover the full cost of lending. As a result, ADBP is not financially viable or
solvent. The other outstanding problems include the burden of unprofitable branches, undue
concentration of risks in certain sectors (tractors), Government's resistance to increases in agricultural
interest rates, low deposit base and the concomitant dependence on SBP for funding.
5.5          Lending and Portfolio Mix. ADBP's lending for agriculture showed a dramatic shift in
the structure and scale of disbursements as evidenced in the following table.

As proportion of gross disbursements.
As shown in the table, aggregate loan disbursements to agriculture expanded at a nominal rate of only
3% p.a. between FY87 and FY92, compared to the projected rate of 25% p.a. Short-term lending
increased its share in total lending progressively from 19% in FY87 to 43% in FY92. Since January
1991, ADBP has stopped new loans for agri-business due to its dismal loan repayment performance,
which explains the falling trend in loan disbursement in this sector. Overall, financing by SBP fell from
75% to 24% of total disbursements due to ADBP's failure, or inability, to honor its debts to SBP without
recourse to involuntary rescheduling, plus SBP's insistence that ADBP should generate its own resources
through loan repayments, income, borrowing, and savings mobilization.
5.6          There was increased lending between 1987 and 1990, which required an expansion of
lending per branch from an average of PRs 25.7 million in 1987 to PRs 29.2 million in 1990. Lending
per branch declined to PRs 25.1 million in 1991 and PRs 21.1 million in 1992. Despite this impressive



early growth, disbursements in FY92 as a proportion of ADBP's total assets averaged only 16% and fell
short of loan collections, representing a net withdrawal of ADBP's funds from the economy. The
outstanding nominal loan portfolio, however, stood at 97% of total assets in FY92. This higher
proportion is primarily a reflection of poor loan recovery.
5.7         The number of villages covered expanded while the number of borrowers declined, partly
due to the larger size of loans, as indicated below.

5.8         The portfolio mix (in terms of disbursement) of the FY87-92 period highlights ADBP's
diversified lending with major changes in short-term lending and tractor lending (see para 5.3 above).
Analysis of total loan disbursement in FY92 by landholding shows that 52 % by number of borrowers and
31% by amount went to farmers with holdings of less than 12.5 ac. A further 23% by number and 29%
by amount went to farmers holding 12.5-25 ac. The balance was made up of the landless and individual
holdings over 25 ac.
5.9         Lending to Small Farmers. A noticeable feature of the loan portfolio is the growing share
of lending to small farmers (with 25 ac or less) which absorbed about 79% of term loans in FY92
compared to 58% in FY87, exceeding the 75% projected at appraisal. The share of loans disbursed to
farmers with holdings below 12.5 ac was 59% in FY87, 64% in FY88, 69% in FY89, 65% in FY90,
66% in FY91 and 49% in FY92 - within appraisal expectations. ADBP's experience with credit to very
small farmers and landless peasants is still limited. It involved three initiatives since 1984. The first was
a credit program to finance income-generating activities among households owning 2 ha (about 5 ac) or
less. It covered only ten villages in the Gujranwala District. In 1985, it was incorporated into a large
program in the same district, supported by IFAD, for farmers owning not more than 2 ha of irrigated
land or 4 ha of rainfed land, landless persons with assets worth not more than the local market value of
1 ha of irrigated land, and rural women. Loan disbursements were largely for dairying to the landless
(38%), to small farmers (31 %) and for cottage industries (28%). By FY92, PRs 182 million for 12,538
cases were disbursed, using 43 MCOs including 3 couple mobile credit officers. The recovery rate was
74% in FY88 but dropped to 62% in FY89 and 58% in 1992, which is lower than the 68% recovery rate
for general credit in Gujranwala district. The third initiative - the Rural Credit Scheme - started in
October 1987 and expanded nationally, using 42 trained male functional mobile credit officers (FMCOs).
During FY92 disbursements were PRs 25 million, 20% higher than in FY88, with the largest number



- 6 -
of loans also for dairy farming. Total disbursement since commencement of the program arnounted to
PRs 138 million covering 6,371 cases. The recovery rate in FY92 was 70%.
5.10        Equipment and vehicles have been procured, albeit with some delay.  Altogether, 344
vehicles (144 more than appraisal estimate) were procured under ICB with the concurrence of the Bank
to meet requirements under the Agricultural Credit Project as well. These comprised 4 buses, 135 long-
wheelbase landcruisers and 205 light vehicles (4 wheel-drive).
5.11        Technical Assistance. Between 1987 and 1992, a total of 114 staff-months of technical
specialists were contracted, but only 81 staff-months were utilized to assist ADBP in O&M studies,
training management, agriculture technology, livestock/dairy development, horticulture, and monitoring
and evaluation, at an average cost of US$8,150 per staff-month compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$6,250 per staff-month covering 144 staff-months.
5.12        Training. There were shortfalls in overseas training - only 24 officers were trained abroad
and 15 officers undertook study tours/visits, against the appraisal estimate of 138 officers.  This was
mainly due to restrictions by the Ministry of Finance which has to approve each individual application.
In addition, over 10,000 employees were trained at ADBP's staff colleges and other institutions in
Pakistan during the project period. There were three staff colleges in FY87, and their number increased
to four in FY88 and to five in FY89. But three were closed (two in FY91 and one in FY92) on the
grounds that the remaining two - at Islamabad and Karachi - would be able to handle ADBP's training
needs. However, the staff college at Islamabad has only two permanent faculty members. As a
proportion of administrative costs, training expenditure has also declined during the project period. The
bank is aware of these problems and has recently taken measures to address them - revision of training
curricula and introduction of 20 % incentive allowance to trainers. While much has been done to improve
training, there is still much scope for improvement in the quality and effectiveness of ADBP's banking
courses, especially on finance and credit policies.
5.13        Studies. Two studies were planned at appraisal. Given the expected negative income
effects of Islamic banking, both studies were directly related to the primary project objective - financial
viability of ADBP. The first study, concerned with ADBP's collateral system under Islamic banking, was
not undertaken, while the second study, related to annual reviews of ADBP's past and projected income
and profit-generating capacity, was carried out in 1987 and 1989. The results of the reviews led to the
increase in the borrowing rate from SBP from 4% to 5% in July 1987 and further to 6% in July 1989.
5.14        Project Costs. Actual cost at project completion was PRs 47.3 billion (US$2.34 billion),
60% higher in rupee terms than the appraisal estimate of PRs 29.5 billion (US$1.67 billion). Because
of the devaluation of the Pakistan rupee, the cost increase in US dollars is lower at 40%. An item-by-
item comparison shows significant differences between projected and actual disbursement of loans.
Fishery development loans accounted for the highest increase (374%), followed by short-term loans
(238%), farm development loans (81%) and project loans (43%), while institutional development
assistance absorbed about 66% of appraisal estimates. The cost overrun was partly due to unit price
increases and partly due to quantity increases.  Appraisal estimates of local price and physical
contingencies proved to be too low. Total project costs at appraisal and completion are given in Part
111/5A.



Institutional Development and Viability
5.15        Institutional Effectiveness and Culture. During the project period, there was a significant
deterioration in the quality of bank management. The frequent changes of the chairman (six chairmen
during the six years commencing 1988), apart from bringing about a destabilizing effect on the bank as
a whole, resulted in lowering staff morale especially at the senior level. This is in sharp contrast to the
situation which prevailed during ADBP-V, when strong leadership, coupled with a pioneering spirit,
motivated regional staff and MCOs. In order that ADBP develop as a viable institution, it was imperative
that innovative managerial leadership and decision-making processes were developed within its own
systems.  As such, decentralization of its administration and increasing professionalization of the
management were expected to become a part of its evolution. However, the dynamism and enthusiasm
generated appear to have been thwarted by political interference in decision-making at various levels -
from head office down to the branches - and also by rigid policies of the head office. Although branch
managers/regional managers are delegated loan sanctioning powers, they enjoy little discretion in
exercising these powers. For example, these officers cannot vary targets for lending categories (e.g.
tractors, private minor irrigation, etc.) allocated in the branch budget by the Credit Division at the head
office.
5.16        Moreover, in addressing problems that arose at the regional level, decision-making power
has been increasingly centralized at the head office (for example, reschedulement), thereby further
restricting the scope for initiative by regional staff. Low morale and helplessness, and the political
interference (for example, even for transfer of MCOs), appear to characterize the organization. The
continued dependence on SBP funding, administered margins, and political interference have all
contributed to create an atmosphere in which collective management effort towards transforming ADBP
into an autonomous, viable organization receives low priority.
5.17        Although about one-third of total staff in 1993 (up from 24% in 1987) were experienced,
counting those over 40 years of age, and nearly 65 % of graduates were non-agricultural graduates (up
from 58 % in 1987), job rotation has remained minimal and career progression is based on seniority. The
bank is overstaffed and often provides poor service to its customers. Management accountability has been
diluted, loan appraisal standards have been lowered and collection efforts have become ineffective.
5.18        Supervised Credit Scheme. An important component of institutional viability is the
supervised credit system operated through MCOs since 1979. The number of MCOs increased from
1,259 in FY87 to 1,454 in FY92, which was slower than targeted at appraisal, as indicated below.

5.19        Since FY86, all general credit loans are being handled by MCOs as supervised credit. The
average loan portfolio covered by all MCOs grew from PRs 16 billion in FY87 to nearly PRs 31 billion
in FY92, an annual increase of 13.5%. Annual loan disbursements by MCOs were PRs 5,351 million
in FY87 and PRs 6,490 million in FY92 - an annual growth of 4%. The average loan portfolio



- 8 -
supervised per MCO was PRs 12.8 million in FY87 and PRs 21.2 million in FY92, which seems high;
annual disbursement per MCO was PRs 4.25 million and PRs 4.46 million, respectively.
5.20        The MCO system was to be strengthened by specialized staff. A cadre of functional mobile
credit officers (FMCOs) - technical specialists covering the fields of dairy, poultry, irrigation, fruit and
vegetables - was introduced in the course of the project. In addition, MCOIs have also been deployed
to intensify credit disbursements in selected villages. These MCOIs were allocated five to six villages
instead of 25 to 30 villages covered by MCOs under the supervised credit scheme. The number of
FMCOs declined from 74 in FY87 to 17 in FY92, while that of MCOIs averaged 30 in the FY87-FY92
period. The reasons for the shortfall were that: (i) MCOs with required qualifications were not available
in some regions; and (ii) field staff were diverted to general lending operations. Consequently, the
implementation of both schemes (FMCO and MCOI) was well below appraisal expectations.
5.21        The success of the MCO system has to be measured against its impact on loan quality and
its operating cost. Loan quality, measured by recovery rates, is not encouraging, as discussed in para
5.29.  Cost figures for the supervised credit scheme alone are not available.  However, total
administrative costs of ADBP, including the MCO system, as a proportion of average assets remained
at 2.2% to 2.9% between FY87 and FY92. Because of differences in loan quality and administrative
costs, these figures do not suggest whether the MCO scheme is fully successful, something that needs
rigorous examination.
5.22        Administrative Efficiency. ADBP's administrative expenses rose by 16% p.a. while its
total loan portfolio increased only at about the same rate (18% p.a.). The average number of staff per
branch, around 22-23, compares adversely with an average of 14 for other banks in Pakistan. Salaries
increased by 17.1%, 45.9% and 5.6% in FY90, FY91 and FY92, respectively, while the number of
employees increased by 12.5% in FY90 and 1.1% in FY91, but declined by 1% in FY92 following a
Government ban on new recruitment since August 1990. The sharp increase of salaries in FY91 was due
to a pay increase of 44%. As a result, salaries to total expenses have increased from 52% in FY87 to
68% in FY92, which is nearly 3% higher than the average percentage for banks in Pakistan, and
compares with 60%-65% in many other developing countries. Part of the explanation lies in the
extensive branch network and very large staff of ADBP.
5.23        Capital and Staff Productivity. The productivity of capital (defined as fixed and other
assets) and employees (defined as the number of staff) can be measured in terms of the average
production of ADBP's services such as borrowers, loan disbursement, loans outstanding, and savings and
deposit mobilization (see Table 1 following Part III). The average of borrowers per employee and capital
declined from 18 to 11 and 0.0002 to 0.0001, respectively, from FY87 to FY92. Similarly, average loan
disbursement in this period per employee and capital decreased from PRs 0.9 million to PRs 0.8 million
and from PRs 12.2 million to PRs 8.7 million, respectively. In contrast, loans outstanding per employee
and capital increased from PRs 2.8 million to PRs 5.1 million and from PRs 37.97 million to PRs 54.36
million, respectively. The same pattern of high staff and capital productivity gains is registered for
savings and deposits mobilization during FY87-92.  Because of differences in labor and capital
productivity trends, these figures do not provide conclusive evidence whether ADBP is cost efficient
overall in producing its products and services, something that needs in-depth review. The challenge
facing ADBP is to reduce staffing levels and to improve operational effectiveness. The level of
employees at ADBP headquarters is excessive and suggests a disproportionate share not dealing directly
with borrowers. A key challenge for ADBP would be to increase the proportion of its staff who are
directly engaged in income-generating activities and collection of arrears.



5.24        Management Information System. The project provided for consolidation and upgrading
of the existing management information system (MIS) in order to improve its speed, accuracy and
coverage. The changes introduced to achieve this included: (i) implementation in FY88 of a new system
called field operations computerization system in all regional computer centers of ADBP; (ii) installation
of new NCR systems at the regional computer centers to enable electronic data processing close to the
source of data generation; (iii) strengthening of procedural standards; and (iv) preparation of a first ever
users' manual. Progress is being made in fully achieving an integrated management information system
responsive to the special needs of ADBP. The existing data processing equipment is outdated, slow and
requires heavy air conditioning and a high level of maintenance. The bank is aware of these problems
and has decided to replace current equipment, which would cost just one year's maintenance expenses
for the old equipment. A unified direction to the operation of four departments under the Computer
Division has recently been put into effect with the assignment of a senior officer in overall charge of the
division.
5.25        Monitoring and Evaluation. The status of the M&E unit changed several times during
the project period - at one time elevated to the level of a division and at other times downgraded to its
present status of a wing within a department. The unit was expected, inter alia, to analyse recovery
performance, monitor administrative costs, refine the incentive scheme, evaluate the system's
effectiveness with a view to improving the efficiency of the organization. Except for loan recovery, these
tasks were performed by the M&E unit satisfactorily. However, its effectiveness seems to have suffered
due to leadership changes, the shifting status of the unit within ADBP and depleted staff in later years.
Project-related functions, such as preparation of periodic returns for submission to international lenders,
are carried out more as an obligatory routine task, and such reports do not form - as a matter of regular
procedure - the subject for discussion and analysis by senior management. The unit is also handicapped
by the lack of staff specially trained in banking and monitoring and evaluation. Learning from poor
recovery experience, there is also a need to review repayments from borrowers who have received new
loans following the rescheduling of their earlier overdues, and borrowers who have not received loans
recently because they have overdue loans. It would have helped to establish which group is performing
better in order to guide future rescheduling operations.
Financial Performance
5.26        General. ADBP's financial position has been weakening since 1988 because of poor
portfolio performance, inappropriate financial and credit policies, high administrative costs and poor
management. The bank's comparative financial statements (Balance Sheets for FY87-92 - Table 2
following Part III, Income Statements for FY87-92 - Table 3) are typical of several specialized
agricultural banks, characterized by mainly term lending, reliance mostly on contributions from SBP and
funds from external agencies under soft terms, and poor loan recovery rates. ADBP has also not
succeeded in mobilizing domestic savings. As a result, it has limited capacity to function as a financial
intermediary.
5.27        Resources. Cash flow statements of ADBP for the FY87-92 period are presented in Table
4 following Part III. Until 1992, the Bank had provided ADBP with more than 50% of its foreign
borrowings, which peaked in FY90 at 72% before falling to 56% in FY92. In itself, this diversification
of resources was a positive development, with the Asian Development Bank and OECF of Japan together
contributing about 35% of ADBP's foreign borrowings. SBP's new financing peaked in FY87 at 44%
but fell to 13% in FY92. At the end of 1992, domestic loan resources (from SBP) outstanding stood at
PRs 27.2 billion or 76% of all debt, foreign or domestic. Up to now, ADBP has relied almost entirely
on SBP for access to local resources. Deposits had grown slowly from PRs 332 million in FY87 to PRs
1,819 million in FY92, representing less than 5% of ADBP's total resources. However, these have since



- 10-
declined sharply. As stated earlier, ADBP has thus played a very minor role in mobilizing domestic
savings.
5.28          Financial Structure and Growth.  ADBP's total assets increased over twofold between
FY87 (PRs 20.6 billion) and FY92 (PRs 45.1 billion); adjusted for inflation, this growth is about 1.4
times or 7.5% per annum on average. Most of this growth took place between 1987 and 1990 when the
loan portfolio increased by almost 60%. Since 1990, there has been a decline in growth in real terms,
as shown below.

5.29           Quality of Portfolio. ADBP's loan portfolio is of poor and deteriorating quality. The table
boelow shows the deteriorating trend in past dues, which grew from 8% to 18% of the portfolio between
June 1987 and June 1992.  It also shows that the past dues growth outpaced the growth in the loan
portfolio. This clearly underlines the deterioration in the quality of ADBP's loan portfolio and the critical
importance of achieving a marked improvement in recovery rates.

5.30           Loan Recoveries.  Overall, loan recoveries dropped steadily from FY88, when they were
around 67%, to FY92, when they were at 53%. Recoveries out of past dues were only 27% in 1992
reflecting the difficulty in recovering funds once a borrower goes into default. Recoveries from current
dues were 65% in 1992 compared with 75% in 1987. ADBP mounted a series of ineffective loan
recovery drives, including a comprehensive action plan under the follow-up project.



- 11 -
5.31        As the bank did not fundamentally alter its lending culture, financial and credit policies,
or improve its institutional capacity as an autonomous banking organization, it is not surprising that the
results have been disappointing. The overall recovery rate (before reschedulement) went down further
by 9% to 44% in FY93. Other reasons have been identified for poor recovery. These include
borrowers' low and variable income, poor sub-project selection, inappropriate loan amount, and
inadequate follow-up by branch staff and MCOs. In addition, political interference, and concessions like
interest remissions as well as willful default continue to play a major role. Also, there are insufficient
incentives or penalties to induce timely repayments; borrowers who default take little risk; bank staff
receive the same rewards whether they make good or bad loans.
5.32        The breakdown of recoveries by regions shows that recovery rates are higher in Punjab
(67%). Baluchistan with 27%, Sindh with 34%, and NWFP with 45% in 1992 remain a cause for
concern. Recovery rates have also been affected by the law and order situation as well as floods in 1992.
5.33        As shown in Table 5 following Part III, short-term loans had the best recovery rate (57%)
for 1992, better than medium-term (for livestock, etc., 48%) and long-term loans (53%). It should be
noted that the short-term (crop loan) will tend to be higher than other categories of past dues, not only
because they have no grace period but also because ADBP's year-end coincides with the major harvest
period. If the harvest is delayed by a few weeks, then past dues will be inflated by the payments due at
June 30, which are significant. In the case of short-term, this will be the full amount of the loan,
whereas in the case of long-term of 10 years, this will only be 10% of the loan. However, tractor loans
are included in long-term and their recovery rate was 63% for 1992. This was the highest rate for all
types of long-term loans but because of very poor recovery rates on other types (e.g., 12% on dairy
farming), the average was only as given above.
5.34        Loan recovery rates are, however, masked by loan rescheduling. While loan rescheduling
is valid in exceptional cases, in practice, in areas where calamity is declared, all loans are rescheduled
under Government instructions. This has the effect of artificially improving the loan recovery rate for
the year concerned. In FY91, floods caused severe damage to many areas and as a result ADBP was
compelled by GOP to offer mass rescheduling of loans, to the extent of PRs 1,587 million. In FY92,
fewer calamities occurred and reschedulement was reduced to PRs 477 million. Recovery rates after
reschedulement increased in 1992 from 53% to 55%, and in 1991 from 53% to 59% (see Table 5).
5.35        Recoveries analyzed by borrower show poor recovery from landless borrowers. Small
farmers with holdings up to 12.5 ac consistently show the best recovery rates, which for the year ended
June 1992 remained at 58%. Recoveries analyzed by branches show a wide variation in loan recovery
performance. This suggests that branch-specific factors - such as branch management and procedures -
may be at least as important a contributor to poor collection performance as poor credit discipline.
5.36        Past Approach to Improve Loan Recovery. Past experience shows that establishing
targets for intensive recovery efforts (linking branch lending to branch recovery), while providing short-
term incentives, is not an adequate response to the underlying problems. The targets also encouraged
decisions to write off interest in return for payments which, while maximizing short-term collections,
rewarded defaulters for not having paid earlier and may have been suboptimal from a longer term
perspective. A key element introduced under the project was the setting of minimum recovery targets
of 77% of total demand by June 1987, 79% by June 1988, and 81% by June 1989. However, the
approach did not assist in improving ADBP's policies and procedures for enhancing collection on a
sustainable basis. It is clear that tightening of eligibility criteria alone will not secure better recovery and
improve the financial integrity of the lending institution. There is a need to improve profit measurements
at the branch level to allow it to make good lending decisions. A more significant need is better loan



- 12 -
appraisal, effective supervision and (most important) effective collection of dues. Adequate provisions
to cover doubtful loans are required while interest accrued on overdue loans should be reversed. The
broad issues affecting credit operations also need to be addressed in order to create a banking
environment conducive to healthy lending operations and growth.
5.37          Operating Results. ADBP's "net profit" dropped considerably from about PRs 390 million
in FY87 to PRs 152 million in FY92. While ADBP was reporting profits, though on a declining level
in recent years, it was actually incurring losses, as shown below, if real bad debt provisions and interest
income reversal had been properly reflected in its accounts. ADBP's income policies need a complete
overhaul. Poor profitability is due primarily to low financial spreads (6.9% of average total assets in
1992) in the face of unusually high provisions for massive non-repayment of loans. Administrative
expenses (2.6%  of average total assets in 1992) are more reasonable.

Note: ATA = Average Total Assets.
5.39          The financial spread suggests that it would be inadequate to absorb the real losses from
ADBP's lending. The resulting losses are partly a result of administered lending rates that do not pass
on the full cost (inclusive of bad debt expenses) of providing loans. This practice results in interest
subsidies to borrowers many of whom, as monitoring studies reveal, are well-to-do persons. De facto



- 13 -
subsidies are enormous for borrowers who subsequently default permanently on such loans. The resulting
losses will eventually, whether directly or indirectly, become a claim on the Government budget. An
important policy issue is the extent to which these losses should be reduced by: (a) raising lending rates;
(b) improving portfolio as well as borrowers' mix; (c) tighter loan appraisal and collection procedures
to reduce losses from bad loans; and (d) greater explicit subsidies. A comprehensive program is needed
to restructure ADBP, designed to restore financial stability, enhance loan recovery and implement priority
programs at an acceptable cost.
5.40        Financial expenses, especially the impact of call market borrowings in 1989 and 1990,
increased dramatically between 1989 and 1991, shrank ADBP's spread on borrowed funds and led to a
financial decline in 1992. The interest charge on call money ranged from 6.5% to 11.50% p.a. during
this period. The average cost of SBP debt grew from about 5% in July 1987 to 6% in July 1989 and
remained at that rate. Increases in ADBP's fixed lending rate, which went up by 0.5% to 12.5% in July
1990 (until July 1992, when it was raised to 13.5%), could only be applied to new loans and therefore
had a very slow impact on the average yield of the loan portfolio. ADBP had ignored three basic
financial principles by: (i) not matching the terms of borrowing - short-term borrowing from SBP to
finance long-term lending; (ii) exposing itself to uncovered loans by indiscriminate rescheduling; and (iii)
undertaking emergency loans without cover from Government. ADBP, short of funds, was unable to
make timely payments to SBP. This added to the mismatching of borrowing/lending terms and strained
ADBP's liquidity severely.
5.41        ADBP's return on average net worth of 3.3% in 1992 may be adequate, if based on sound
financial policies and continuing, to ensure financial viability. However, as a real return on equity (net
of inflation) it is negative. As long as ADBP camlot achieve better profitability, it will have to continue
to rely heavily on SBP for new infusion of funds, as needed. This means that ADBP is financially not
self-sustaining, or becoming so.
5.42        The case is different for branch profitability, with some making nominal profits and others
incurring losses. The number of branches reporting losses increased from 45 in 1987 to 179 in 1992.
Analysis of branch profitability in relation to the size of the loan portfolio or recovery rates does not
show any correlation between these variables. In FY92, the region of Nawabshah had a profit of PRs
7.5 million, with a portfolio of PRs 1,134 million and a low recovery rate of 43%. On the other hand,
the region of Bahawalnagar with a portfolio of PRs 915 million had a profit of PRs 16.1 million and the
highest recovery rate of 97 %. This is explained by the present practice of measuring net profit at branch
level, which does not take account of provisions or interest income reversal on overdue loans. Both
provisions and income reversal are collectively consolidated only in the profit and loss account of ADBP
as a whole. As a result, the branch profit and loss account ceases to be a performance measure
motivating the branch to make good loans, although information on provisions and income reversal is
passed on to the branches as a matter of routine.
5.43        Financial and Economic Subsidy. The reported profits of ADBP show that its lending
program as a whole was profitable during the period FY87-92. If underprovision as set out in para 5.38
is reckoned, the financial subsidy would range from PRs 90 to PRs 698 million during this period. The
funds utilized by ADBP were subsidized (as they were either equity or concessional finance borrowed
at lower than market rates); as such the bank enjoyed economic subsidy, defined as the subsidy due to
the differences between the actual costs and the opportunity costs of these funds valued at the market rate
of interest. The opportunity costs of its funds are evaluated using the weighted average interest rate for
fixed deposits of five years or over. ADBP receives economic subsidy in the case of borrowings from
SBP and international agencies as well as on total equity. The results of this evaluation are presented in
Table 6 following Part III. It shows that the economic subsidy of ADBP's lending varied from 43 % to



- 14 -
59% during the project period. The analysis suggests that ADBP could have eliminated the nominal
subsidies by raising the prevailing average lending rate from 10.6% to 16.6% in FY92. In reality, much
higher lending rates would have been required for self-sustaining profitability and growth.
Impact on Sectoral Issues
5.44         Interest Rates. Under the project, ADBP was required to review its rates of return or
other charges to ensure that they remained positive in real terms and sufficient to cover its operating
expenses including taxes, if any, and interest payments or returns and service charges on borrowings;
make provisions for bad debts and maintain such provisions at a ratio to total overdues satisfactory to the
Bank; and accumulate reserves that would be adequate to ensure, in conjunction with a contribution by
SBP to paid-up capital, that the ratio of debt to equity was not greater than 7:1. ADBP increased its
nominal rate to 12 % in April 1985, to 12.5 % in July 1990, and further to 13.5 % in July 1992. Provisions
for bad debts were raised to 40% or more of overdues since FY87, and ADBP relied on funding from
SBP to maintain a debt to equity ratio not greater than 7:1. ADBP's rates of return, however, tended
to be somewhat below market rates. For some activities like tractor loans, the rate to sub-borrowers was
reduced from 12% to 8% in January 1992, and then progressively increased again to 9% in July 1992,
10% in July 1993, 11% in August 1993 and finally to 13.5%  in September 1993.
5.45         While short-term rates equal long-term rates, they have played a minimal role in resource
allocation. Instead, they have been used mainly as a distributional instrument to lower the cost of loans
to borrowers rather than to allocate credit to sub-projects with high returns.

5.46         Savings Mobilization. The issue of savings mobilization was not addressed in the sixth
project. However, funds were provided in the follow-up project for consultants to develop a savings
mobilization strategy. The follow-up project also included strategic planning and upgrading facilities to
promote savings mobilization. ADBP has been under pressure from SBP to increase its domestic
deposits, for which, on average, it would have to pay 7%, and some progress was made in savings
mobilization under the sixth project. As domestic deposits grew from PRs 332 million in FY87 to PRs
1,819 million in FY92 and liabilities grew at a slower rate, deposits increased from 2% to 5% of total
liabilities (excluding equity). This slow growth reflected ADBP's relative inability to mobilize and deploy
(lend) savings profitably in competition with other financial intermediaries (formal and informal).
5.47         ADBP's Place in Rural Market Reform. The Bank has supported a series of investments
in Pakistan's agriculture including irrigation and drainage, research and extension services. Hence, an
effective agricultural credit system was perceived as being essential to facilitate growth in agriculture.
Given ADBP's involvement in agricultural financing in the past, its continued role raises two major
issues: firstly, whether the farm investments financed by ADBP loans have generated adequate returns;
and secondly, what impact the Bank's projects have had on the development of sustainable rural financial

markets that are able to provide longer term support to agriculture. ADBP's M&E unit made an attempt
to evaluate impact at farm level, but not much is known on how the returns on farm investments have
been utilized, considering the rising level of overdue loans.
5.48        The issue of broadening the rural financial markets was addressed under the follow-up
project. At one end of the market, commercial banks were included as participating agencies which could
compete with ADBP in term lending. At the other end of the market, NGOs' involvement was proposed
in order to reach smaller farmers with less collateral in an effective manner at low cost, thereby drawing
them into the financial system. It is not clear whether any single institution can meet all the needs of the
rural financial sector. ADBP has not been successful in mobilizing savings. It has also provided loans
below market rates although agricultural investments have a poor repayment record. This may have
contributed to the crowding out of other formal financial intermediaries so that in FY92 ADBP's
agricultural lending accounted for 29% of short-term credit and 91 % of term lending to agriculture.
There may be a case for promoting other institutions as well to mobilize savings and extend credit in the
country's rural financial sector.
6. Project Results
6.1         The principal objectives of the project have not been fully achieved. While ADBP has not
developed into an effective and self-sustaining lending institution, M&E data suggest that it may have
contributed to increased farm productivity and incomes among its borrowers. ADBP's coverage and
lending volumes have declined since FY90; loan recoveries have deteriorated, and domestic savings
mobilization has remained marginal, all combining to increase reliance on low-cost funding from SBP,
critical for its sustainability. On the other hand, ADBP has made a substantial, though declining,
contribution to the financing of farm investments during the period under review. This is reflected in
its position as the country's largest supplier of agricultural credit, with 47%, followed by commercial
banks (31%) and the Federal Bank for Cooperatives (22%). Project funds were substantially allocated
to farm investments: in financing the expansion of durable farm assets in order to strengthen the basis
for increasing the annual marketable surplus. This meant capital deepening: traction machinery,
irrigation equipment, livestock and orchards. These improvements were neither new to the economy nor
to the farmer. Nevertheless, capital deepening is part of the process of technical progress and these
project achievements are substantial. The falloff in tractor lending did occur more or less as projected,
and lending for small tractors appears not to be generally acceptable to even those with smaller farms,
largely because local soil conditions require the power of the more customarily used medium-size tractors.
The secondary use of tractors for transport is also a factor favoring the traditional size. The channelling
of an increasing share of ADBP funds to small farms did meet the planned targets.
6.2         The project has directly benefited about 767,000 beneficiaries, about 467,000 more than
targeted at appraisal, and has generated incremental employment of about 82.5 million workdays annually
(at full development). Indicative as these numbers are, they point clearly to the significant role played
by ADBP in the creation of rural employment.
6.3         Re-estimated financial rates of return ranged from 14 % to 51 %, compared to 18 % to 49%
at appraisal, whereas re-estimated economic rates of return ranged from 25 % to 60 %, compared to 22 %
to 50% at appraisal. The ERRs presented in Part III/6B were estimated on the basis of appraisal
assumptions. The lower than expected ERR for the rainfed wheat model at completion (32% vs. 48%)
is mainly attributed to a smaller proportion of fodder area than estimated at appraisal which was not fully
offset by higher yields. On the other hand, the higher ERR for the irrigated wheat model (25 % against
22% at appraisal) is largely explained by the reduction in wheat in favor of Basmati rice which had a
better price.



- 16 -
6.4         The levels of FRRs indicate that most investments could have supported loans at market
rates of interest. Accordingly, the overall rate of investment would probably not have been lower in the
absence of administered interest rates, though some investments with low returns, such as tractors on
rainfed farms, might not have been made without the preferential interest rates.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1         While both domestic and foreign sources of low-cost funds have helped ADBP support its
high-cost supervised credit operation, they raise a serious question about its sustainability. It is apparent
that ADBP cannot survive as a meaningful financial intermediary without these subsidized funds. The
issues are whether ADBP can operate without subsidy, and what such non-subsidized operation would
mean for farmers, particularly small farmers. There are two sources of subsidy - financial and economic.
If ADBP is not cost-effective, it will need financial subsidy to continue its operation. If the sources of
funding for on-lending are cheaper when evaluated at their opportunity costs, ADBP will enjoy economic
subsidy. Both types of subsidy are relevant for ADBP as they determine its long-run relevance.
However, their "permanent" requirement defines ADBP's lack of long-term viability.
7.2         Financial and economic viability are necessary but not sufficient for ADBP's viability as
a financial institution. The bank also needs to be institutionally viable to be able to cater to its clients
on a sustainable basis. However, institutional viability cannot be achieved unless the benefits generated
for borrowers are also sustainable. This is because of high collinearity between the viability of borrowers
and the viability of the lender which depends on the same environmental and production risks. The inter-
relationships between financial, economic, institutional and borrowers' viabilities can be illustrated by
considering ADBP's access to low-cost funds. At present, ADBP's access to low-cost funds substantially
reduces the cost of borrowing, which has implications for both the financial and economic viability of
ADBP as well as borrowers' viability and, hence, institutional viability. If these sources of inexpensive
funding were not available and ADBP was forced to borrow money from the market, the sustainability
of ADBP would depend on whether it could break even at the market rate of interest, whether borrowers
could meet the higher cost of borrowing or whether ADBP, through cost efficiency and institutional
improvements, could absorb the increased costs. The long-run sustainability of ADBP, therefore,
depends on its cost and institutional structures as well as funding sources.
7.3         ADBP has relied heavily on subsidized funds to support its high-cost lending but cannot rely
on these funds for a longer period. The long-run sustainability issue for ADBP, therefore, is how to
become financially profitable and self-sustaining. ADBP's experience suggests that small farmers are
indeed a lesser credit risk as higher repayment rates have been recorded. This reduces the default cost
of lending. The loan portfolio mix is also closely related to the risks and costs. For example, as tractor
loans are given in large amounts and to bigger farmers, the cost per unit of disbursement is perhaps lower
than the cost for a similar loan lent out in small amounts to many individuals. ADBP, with help from
donors, has been investing substantially in staff training and development, which might have a positive
impact on institutional sustainability in a conducive environment; otherwise its impact is negligible.
7.4         ADBP's sustainability also hinges on a significant improvement in the loan recovery rate.
As mentioned earlier, this rate declined from 66% in 1987 to 44% in 1993. In 1993, ADBP recovered
only 13.7% of overdue balances in project loans. Following calamities, approximately 28% of ADBP's
arrears were rescheduled in 1990, another 30% in 1991, 6% in 1992, and 53% in 1993. While the bank
has made a series of efforts to improve its recovery rate, the continued decline in loan recovery has
entailed substantial losses. The sn!bsidy dependence index calculated for ADBP shows that reliance on
subsidies fell from 52% to 46% between FY87 and FY91 but rose to 57% in FY92. While such progress
is encouraging, prospects for ADBP's long-run sustainability remain dim.

8. Bank Performance
8.1         While the Bank's performance throughout the project cycle was generally satisfactory, the
Bank could usefully have paid more attention to ADBP's financial condition. While recognizing problems
in the financial sector (later during implementation through a joint GOP/Bank review of the rural financial
sector) that made progress in improving ADBP slow, covenants did not initiate critical improvements (for
example, in control of loan arrears) necessary for long-term stability.
8.2         Bank supervision missions visited ADBP with reasonable frequency, on average once every
eight months in the years 1987 to 1992. There was good staff continuity and the missions performed
well, concentrating on institutional objectives, though not sufficiently on credit and financial
policies/issues. As a result of suggestions made during supervision, improvements were made resulting
in an increased lending rate. While supervision reports usually reflected a constructive attitude and effort,
they also at times appear uncritical in their evaluation of ADBP's situation, progress and prospects.
8.3         While the SAR of April 1986 had cleared ADBP, the May 1987 supervision mission
expressed strong concern over, inter alia, poor loan recovery. The next mission in December 1987 stated
bluntly that "vigorous recovery efforts have to be made to reach the envisaged overall recovery rate of
79% at the end of FY88". Similar concerns were expressed with varying force through FY92.
8.4         The Bank was also flexible in agreeing to reallocation of resources for lending and in
allowing utilization of savings from technical assistance for purchase of vehicles.
8.5         The main lessons learned from the implementation experience of the project are as follows:
(i)     The case of ADBP confirms, a lesson often learnt, that institution building is a
slow process, the pace of which must be generated within the institution itself if it is to be sustained, and
that assistance which can be given by external agencies like the Bank, while at times valuable, also has
clear limitations. This is especially so in staffing and management.
- (ii)  The critical importance of stable, strong and capable leadership on a continuing
basis is demonstrated by the experience of ADBP, which had seven chairmen between 1987 and 1992.
While there can be a role for short-term consultants, they cannot substitute for local management.
Building good institutions begins with strong management.
(iii)    ADBP's experience, which is matched by many similar cases in South Asia,
suggests that it is preferable to have agricultural banks that are closely integrated into a country's financial
system rather than institutions given such a specialized position as ADBP. The risk is that the bank
grows into a complacent bureaucracy rather than a development-oriented, competitive business
organization.
(iv)    The Bank should take a firmer position regarding the financial performance of the
banks, insisting on satisfactory results as a precondition for (continued) lending. The Bank should always
receive a thorough, independent audit report on the institution's financial position including its loan
portfolio before lending to it.
(v)     In designing repeater projects like the Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 3226-PAK
and Cr. 2153-PAK), it would have been desirable to avoid the overlap with the preceding sixth project,
which reduced the opportunity of learning from the implementation experience of that project.



- 18 -
(vi)    It is clear that establishing targets for recovery efforts, while providing short-term
incentives, is not an adequate response to the underlying problems. Adequate provisions to cover possible
loan losses are required, while bad debts should be written off. The broad issues affecting loan
operations also need to be addressed in order to create a banking environment conducive to healthy
lending operations and growth.
(vii)    Poor profitability of agricultural banks in general, and ADBP in particular, is the
result of administered, subsidized interest rates to borrowers, which do not pass on the full cost of
lending. In addition, ADBP incurs losses due to non-accrual of interest on overdue loans while paying
interest on dues to SBP, and interest remission on bank loans introduced by Government from time to
time without reimbursement. It is likely that interest rates are subsidized without full appreciation of the
costs and effect on ADBP viability.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1         The project was prepared by ADBP with the assistance of consultants. However, during
implementation, project performance suffered partly due to the lack of stable, strong and capable
leadership. Equally or more important were the cumulative effects of poor credit and financial policies,
and of a worsening external environment for agricultural lending (notably natural disasters, political
interference, and a breakdown in agricultural credit discipline). Relatively low disbursements were made
by ADBP in the last two years of the project due to cutbacks in SBP funding. There was also increasing
concern over deteriorating loan recovery performance, which necessitated more attention to loan
collection than to loan disbursements. As a result, new project loans (financed largely by the Asian
Development Bank) have been stopped for the past 26 months, because of their unacceptably low
repayment performance. Problems in getting Government agreement to raising lending rates as stipulated
in legal covenants were eventually resolved to a significant (though insufficient) degree.
9.2         The rapid expansion of agricultural lending (annual growth of 39%) under ADBP-V would
have been difficult to absorb administratively even for the best managed institutions, and it has,
predictably, placed ADBP with its inadequately prepared staff and systems under serious strain. The
contribution of the sixth project to improving the capability of the bank is hard to isolate, since ADBP
has gained from concurrent implementation of several projects as well as from interaction with Bank staff
and expatriate consultants provided under various projects. The major institutional benefits of this
interaction include: (a) diversification of loan portfolio; (b) lending to small farmers in a significant
manner; (c) strengthening of the MCO system; and (d) development of improved monitoring procedures
and prudent financial policies.
10. Project Relationship
10.1        Through long association with ADBP under five previous credit lines, the Bank had
developed a good working relationship, allowing its supervision staff to become familiar with the country
and the implementing agency (ADBP), its issues and concerns. While most project-specific problems
were eventually resolved, crucial issues such as loan recovery rates were not resolved.
10.2        Bank and Borrower relationships with other relevant parties, including consultants, have
been generally satisfactory. However, the Bank together with ADBP's other donors (OECF, ADB and
IFAD) subsequently cancelled their financial support (in June 1994) due to ADBP's continuing poor
performance under the seventh lire of credit.



- 19 -
11. Consulting Services
11.1       The number of staff-months (81 staff-months at US$8,150 per staff-month) utilized undcr
the project was modest, compared to those provided and utilized under the previous (fifth) project (192
staff-months at US$12,200 per staff-month), or those provided under the follow-on project (181 staff-
months at US$15,750 per staff-month). In general, satisfaction was expressed by ADBP over the
performance of the consultants engaged under this project. Apart from recommendations made by O&M
consultants, which were found to be practically unworkable, the work of other consultants was considered
satisfactory by the user departments of ADBP.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1       The Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, Development Credit Agreement and
Project Agreement were detailed enough to provide a basic framework for the Bank and ADBP during
project implementation.
12.2       During supervision, there was not much difficulty in getting data on the status of project
implementation. The supervision reports and the relevant project documents available at the Bank
provided information for the preparation of the project completion report. ADBP's project completion
report contained a good factual account of project implementation. In addition, ADBP was able to meet
the remaining data requirements requested by the PCR mission.

PART-1I
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OF ADBP-VI PROJECT
A. Comments on Part-III of the Report
1.          Part-III of the report contains statistical tables prepared by the mission. The information
pertaining to ADBP activities is accurate and sufficient to evaluate the project.
B. Comments on Part-I of the Report
2.          Para 4.2:   The bank kept its provision at 40% or more of past dues and maintaining
debt:equity ratio at desired level. The rate of return was approved by Federal Government at 13.5% by
withdrawing 1 % excise duty on Agricultural loans w.e.f. 01-07-92.
3.          Para 5.3:   It has been observed that Bank's short term lending has progressively
increased its share in total lending from 19% in FY 87 to 43% in FY 92 and thus exceeded the ceiling
of 20% (targetted at appraisal) in all the years except in FY 87. The reason is that Agriculture depends
on nature. The increase in production loans was due to damages to crops by recurring floods and attack
of pest. The price of inputs - seed, fertilizer and pesticides, increased manifold. Besides, inputs are
essentially required to boost production of crops to meet the growing needs for wheat, sugar and maize
etc.
4.          Para 5.4:   It has further been reported in the report under review that over-dues are high
and loan recovery has been low and falling, largely as a result of rapid credit expansion without due
attention to the quality of loans. No doubt the overdues increased but this was not due to lack of
attention to quality of loans. The Bank paid due attention to the quality of lending. The actual reason
of increase in over-dues remained un-precedented floods and attack of diseases and pests to crops. The
farming community, especially the small farmers, have no other means of income than agricultural
produce. Once their crops are destroyed by natural calamities, the farmers cannot repay their loans until
the harvest of next successful crop. Unfortunately natural calamities hit farmers again and again.
5.          Para 5.5:   It has also been observed in the report that aggregate loan disbursements to
agriculture expanded at a nominal rate of only 3% P.A. between FY 87-92 compared to the projected
growth rate of 25 % per annum. The low growth rate is due to continuous decrease in the financing by
State Bank of Pakistan. The recovery of dues remained low due to natural calamities.
6.          Para 5.9:   Bank's growing share of lending to small farmers (with 25 acres or less)
which absorbed about 79% of term loans in 1992 compared to 58% in 1987 has been noticed with
satisfaction. The Bank is laying more and more stress on lending to small farmers.
7.          Para 5.22:  ADBP is a dynamic organization and is providing loan to the Agriculturists
at their door steps. It was, therefore, considered necessary to expand the branch net-work in the country.
So the staff strength also increased due to increase in number of branches. The Salaries and Wages of
Officers and Staff of NCBs and Financial Institutions are revised by Pay Committees/Commissions are
binding on both the employer and the employees. There was an overall increase of about 28 % in the pay
scale in salaries and benefits, the cost per employee has increased.



- 22 -
8.         Para 5.23:  A study in depth is being made in the Personnel Division and excess staff in
the field offices/H.O is being adjusted in the branches in a phased manner to increase the staff strength
in the field to serve the needy farming community in a more efficient and dedicated manner. Resource
Mobilization and Kissan Bank Windows have been opened under the directives of Prime Minister of
Pakistan. Thus more staff is needed to meet the challenges. The Regional Recovery Officers have been
posted at Regional Headquarters to supervise and assist in collection of arrears from the defaulters of the
Bank.
9.         Para 5.28:  Long term debt in FY-1990 at 1992/93 prices by using GDP deflator has been
reported as Rs.32,852/- Million instead of Rs.34,184/- Million.
10.        Para 5.38:  The net profit of the bank dropped in FY-91 due to reflection of full impact
of provision of bad & doubtful loans under the Prudential Regulations according to which the production
loans which are in default for more than 360 days are classified and provision thereof is made under the
prudential Regulations.
11.        Para 5.40:  Concessions to borrowers are allowed on the instruction/approval of the
Federal Government.
12.        Para 5.41:  ADBP was not able to make repayment of SBP loans in FY 1991 and 1993
mainly due to two reasons i.e. (i) Reduction in supply of credit by SBP which rose to 30%, 40%, 50%
and 60% in FY 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively. (ii) Rescheduling of SBP loans availed by the
Bank in FY 1990, 1991, 1992 & 1993 converting maximum amount of loan into short term mis-matching
to the terms of ADBP's own disbursement. However, SBP agreed to reschedule its loans availed by
ADBP in FY 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 in accordance with the terms of ADBP's own terms in FY
1994. In addition of this an amount of Rs.6951 Million defaulted by Bank, out of previous rescheduled
loans upto 30-06-1989 was also converted into long term finance limit by SBP. Accordingly SBP loans
amounting to Rs.4702 Million fallen due upto 30-06-1994 has been fully repaid.
13.        Para 5.42:  Efforts are being made to increase recovery of bank dues to make the return
on average net worth adequate for ensuring financial viability.
14.        Para 5.45:  The rate of return with the approval of the Federal Government has already
been increased from 12.5% to 13.5% from 01-07-1992. The bank maintained the provision for Bad &
Doubtful at 40% or more of its past dues and kept the debt:equity ratio at the desired level of 7:1.
C. Bank's Performance
15.        The appraisal report of ADBP-VI project covered targets for individual project components
in line with trend of ADBP-V project. It also included a system of farm development loans package,
technical assistance and training component. The comprehensive appraisal of ADBP-VI project helped
ADBP in expanding the size of general lending, loans to small farmers, adoption of new technologies in
agriculture and institutional development.
16.        Before the loan negotiations started in January 1986, the Bank was requested to meet
reimbursement against short term lending for production loans to small farmers (with holding below 25
acres) during the currency of the project. The Bank did not agree to ADBP's request on the plea that
the inclusion of short term lending in the covenant would lead to distortions.



- 23 -
17.        During the loan negotiations, the Bank was fully supportive in the sense that Bank agreed
for certain modifications in the draft agreements like i) 7 % spread to ADBP during first year and fixing
of lending rate by SBP to ADBP on the basis of annual review of ADBP's financial position in the
subsequent years ii) waiving of the condition of maintaining 1:1 reserves to paid-up capital ratio iii)
enhancement of IBRD loan by US$20 million and iv) raising the expenditure to be financed from the loan
from 25% to 31%.
18.        The Bank was equally concerned with ADBP's financial viability and profitability as a result
of the introduction of the Islamic Banking System. The Bank appraisal mission agreed over three major
modes of financing under IBS viz-a-viz, hire purchase, leasing and mark-up. However, the Bank did not
agree for reimbursement against any sub-loans made by ADBP under the PLS and service charge modes.
In order to ensure ADBP's financial viability, the Bank allowed a covenant under Section 2.06 of Project
Agreement which states that ADBP shall not utilize any part of the loan proceeds and the credit to extend
financing on the basis of PLS or service charge or any other basis which is not acceptable to the Bank
and the Association.
19.        With respect to procurement of vehicles the Bank did not accede to reserved procurement
which was apparently compulsory for projects executed by GOP agencies. Accordingly, the Bank did
not cover vehicles in the project. However, at the end of the project, ADBP made a request to the Bank
for no objection to the procurement of vehicles under local competitive bidding procedures by using part
of the remaining funds from category (8) "Equipment for part b(i) and b(ii) of the project and (9)
consultants services and training of ADBP-VI for this purpose. The Bank agreed to use the remaining
funds of ADBP-VI for the procurement of vehicles under ICB.
20.        The funds earmarked for farm implements and PMI were exhausted in FY'89. Funds
provided for orchards, vegetable farms and on-farm development had moved slower than expected.
Accordingly, it was proposed to the Bank for re-allocation of funds which was agreed by the Bank.
21.        The Bank's Missions maintained close monitoring of the ADBP-VI project. The Missions
visited the ADBP fairly on regular basis with an average interval of 8 months a year. The rnission
members were qualified, and well experienced. The Staff continuity was good, as the same mission
leader continued to lead the mission. During their visits, the pace of implementation of the project was
reviewed and the observations made in the form of Aide Memoires. Timely and comprehensive reviews
provided the management required feed-back to overcome the implementation shortcomings.
D. Borrower's Performance
22.        The Bank was equally concerned to reduce the relative weight of ADBP tractor lending in
order to diversify overall lending operations of ADBP. The Bank's proposal was appreciated by ADBP.
Resultantly, ADBP's lending for non-tractor items was raised from 51 % in FY'87 to 73 % in FY'92. A
sharp change in share of tractor lending was also contributed by persistent rise in prices of tractor units.
23.        The amount allocated for small tractors in the project loan agreement could not be utilized.
This was due to the fact that small tractors did not attract a significant market response in Pakistan mainly
because of generally hard soil texture in the country along with non-suitability of small tractors for all
farm operations. Almost all farmers including small land operators preferred to keep medium-size
tractors to supplement their income from off-farm activities and use of trolley. Similarly, the funds
provided for solar pumps remained unutilized due to delay in the finalization of the forthcoming
government subsidy. Besides, these pumps were found to have a low discharge capacity and were not
capable of crop irrigation. On the other hand, funds earmarked for farm implements and PMI were



- 24 -
exhausted much earlier as the demand for these items was strong. However, these facts were not kept
in view at the appraisal time which ultimately resulted in delay in the implementation of the project.
24.        Compliance of clause-I schedule 2 of the project agreement of ADBP-VI benefitted ADBP
with the introduction of following institutional reforms:-
(i)        Establishment of Agricultural technology transfer centres and Mobile Mechanization
Demonstration Units (MMDUs).
(ii)       Strengthening of credit policy and appraisal department with the introduction of institutional
reform measures.
(iii)      Use of FMCOs and MCO(I).
25.        Concern of the Bank was growing over the repayment performance of ADBP as the rate
of recovery remained much behind the level of 81% stipulated during FY'89. Severe drought conditions,
short-fall in production targets of major crops except cotton, some parte of the country with deteriorating
law and order situation, traditionally bad recovery behaviour particularly in Sindh and Baluchistan
coupled with resolution passed by one provincial assembly for postponement of ADBP loans and
declaration of interest-payment as repugnant to Islamic injunctions caused serious set-back to the recovery
efforts of ADBP. As such, recovery targets set in section 4.08 of the project agreement could not be
fully achieved.
26.        A financial covenant under section 4.04 of the Project Agreement was included by the Bank
which stipulates that ADBP shall carry out an annual review of its past and projected income and profit
generating capacity and develop proposals for the measures to be taken to achieve a level of profits that
would be required to accumulate reserves sufficient to ensure, in conjunction with GOP's contributions
to ADBP's paid-up capital, that ADBP's debt to equity ratio does not exceed 7:1 level. This type of
study was carried out for the first time by ADBP. This study helped ADBP to analyse its current
financial position and develop proposals to achieve a desired level of profit through maintaining 7:1 as
debt-equity ratio.
27.        Computerization of loan and financial data base is vital for any large development financial
organization like ADBP. It is a pre-requisite to establish an efficient Management Information System
with required precision and speed to cater to the ever-growing Management data needs. Keeping the
inherent weaknesses in the generation of management information in view, the Bank recommended to re-
organize and strengthen computer documentation of the field operation computerization system (FOCS).
Accordingly, procedural standards were strengthened and re-inforced and a first-ever users' manual was
introduced. A new software relating to WRITE-OFF LOANS INFORMATION SYSTEM was developed
and implemented in all regional computer centres.
28.        Pakistan is a small-farm country. In line with the Bank's policy, emphasis on small farms
is one of the major objectives of ADBP. The Bank introduced a covenant under Section 4.06 (a) of
project agreement to channel at least 75 % of its medium and long term loans/financing to farmers owning
25 ac. of land or less, and within this category, at least 50% of such loans to farmers owning 12.5 ac.
of land or less. Accordingly, lending to small farmer (under 25.0 ac.) under medium and long term
financing of total credit shared 79% while share of 12.5 ac. land operators' within the small farmer
loaning under medium and long term financing amounted to 49% which is almost in conformity to the
covenant of the World Bank.
29.        A total of 144 man-month of consultancy services were provided under ADBP-VI project.
During the project, Consultancy of 114 mm were contracted with different firms for service to various



- 25 -
departments of ADBP. Out of 114 mm, 81 mm were utilized during the project. The performance of
the consultants was reported satisfactory by the user departments.  However, in view of a user
department, the report prepared by Mr. Steven C. Shepley was conceptually satisfactory but
recommendations on MIS were not considered practically workable under the already existing large EDP
environment.
E. Problems Faced
30.         ADBP experienced serious practical problems in achieving a breakthrough in resource
mobilization which could not be visualized as the ADBP branches do not possess the required orientation
towards deposit mobilization. This is a reflection of the Bank's organizational culture that has developed
because its activities are geared particularly towards loan disbursement, recovery and extension work.
Deposits were generally of short term duration while Bank's lending was predominantly long-term,
resulting in maturity mismatching besides the inconvenient location of ADBP branches. Linking of SBP
funds with resource generation at a rate of 10% per annum progressively with effect from FY'87 created
serious resource constraints to ADBP. As a result, ADBP could not disburse sufficient credit to the
farmers as stipulated in appraisal report of the project.
31.         The second major set-back was fall in recovery rates due to various unforeseen factors like
deteriorating law and order situation in Sind, crop failures, flood devastations, resolution by NWFP
provincial government to defer recovery of ADBP dues, and decision of Shariat Court declaring interest
as repugnant to the injunctions of Islam etc. These factors severely hampered the recovery efforts of all
DFIs in the country for which ADBP was no exception.
F. Lessons Learnt
32.         The ADBP-VI project was a step forward in utilizing valuable World Bank's support to
ADBP in strengthening its financial and technological capabilities which greatly benefitted a large rural
population and farming community in Pakistan. During the process of implementation of the project,
many new avenues were seen which need to be kept in view more carefully in all future project
formulation process with particular reference to Pakistan. These are discussed below:-
(i)         The creation of a steady and tangible deposit base is one of the more challenging aspects
confronting the ADBP. Some infrastructural changes are needed so that ADBP should
become capable of generating some resources on its own. ADBP is a premier specialized
development credit institution in the country. It has to be kept in view that deposit
mobilization/resource mobilization should not be prioritized in a way that the primary
mandate of providing wider service to target population covering landless, small land
operators, women and role of ADBP in modernization of agriculture is hampered.
(ii)        Recovery of loan is vital for any development financial institution. However, some
shortcomings in recovery due to unforeseen natural calamities, which are frequent in
agriculture sector, should not obstruct the development role of a non-financial development
institution. The large community of a country engaged in production of food and cash crop
could not be deprived of further investment in this area for want of high recovery rates.
(iii)       ADBP is obliged to accommodate investment capital needs of farmers. The demand for
production loans has substantially increased as a result of persistent rise in prices and
increased use of modern farm inputs. Accordingly, the conditioning of production loans
to a specific percentage was not considered workable during the project.



- 26 -
(iv)       Introduction and expansion of appropriate new technology is always welcome subject to its
prospects for adoption on commercial scale in an area. Tight conditions for small tractor
financing did not work. Accordingly, conditions for introduction of new technology
without thorough experimentation in advance may not be adviseable.

ANNEX 1
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. INTRODUCTION
General
1.         This Annex presents the main assumptions and results of the financial and economic analysis
of investment models financed under ADBP-VI. All calculations were done in 1991/92 prices.
2.         At appraisal, the financial and economic analysis was undertaken in constant 1985 prices
for four representative farm models to illustrate the viability of the proposed investments. These
included: (i) a mouldboard plow for a 40 acre rainfed wheat farm; (ii) a reversible mouldboard plow for
a 10 acre irrigated wheat/cotton farm; (iii) special equipment for a 12.5 acre vegetable production farm;
and (iv) development of a 12.5 acre apple orchard (semi-dwarf varieties). Constant 1985 prices of
outputs and inputs were used in both the financial and economic analysis. For traded commodities like
wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize and cotton, economic prices were based on export parity prices, and for
fertilizers on import parity prices. Prices of non-traded commodities were based on financial prices,
adjusted by a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.90. The economic cost of unskilled labor was based
on seasonal market wage rates, adjusted by a CF of 0.80.
3.         The financial and economic analysis in the PCR followed the appraisal methodology. Three
of the four investment models were used; the vegetable production model was dropped because lending
was negligible. Two additional farm models - private minor irrigation and livestock production
development - have been analyzed, which accounted for substantial lending under the project.
4.         The analysis utilized information from the baseline and terminal surveys conducted in FY86
and FY91, respectively, by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of ADBP. The baseline survey was
carried out using samples of 1,500 prospective borrowers and collected information on land utilization,
cropping patterns and intensities, yields, farm mechanization, production costs and incomes. It was
followed by annual monitoring surveys. The terminal survey concentrated mainly on the impact of the
investments.
Yields
5.         Actual crop yields are based on the results of surveys. A comparison of appraisal and PCR
estimates is in Table 1.
Financial Prices
6.         Average 1991/92 farmgate prices prevailing in the project areas have been used in the
financial analysis. The price of wheat (PRs 3.25/kg) is slightly above the Government's support price
(PRs 3.10/kg) reflecting the high demand and better market access in the main producing areas. The
price of paddy is also above the Government's support price given the high demand from private traders
for basmati rice. The price of seed cotton (PRs 6.25/kg) is below the Government's support price (PRs
6.83/kg) illustrating farners' dependence on the closest ginnery in selling their crop. The price of
sugarcane is close to the Government's support price. Prices for maize, livestock products and fruit
reflect average farmgate prices received by farmers. Unskilled labor has been costed at the average

seasonal market wage rates, which range from PRs 9.4/hour during the peak season to PRs 6.6/hour
during the slack season.
7.         Production and operating costs are also based on 1991/92 data. For the calculation of debt
servicing, a borrowers' contribution of around 13% of total investment and interest rates of 12.5%
presently charged by ADBP for both short-term and long-term loans were adopted.
Economic Prices
8.         The economic prices used are based on the estimates in the Staff Appraisal Report on the
Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South) Irrigation and Drainage Project (Cr. 2410-PAK). To reflect the higher
quality of basmati rice, a 25 % premium has been added to the economic price of IRRI rice. Economic
prices of maize and other crops have been obtained by applying the SCF of 0.9 to their financial prices.
Subsidy elements have been eliminated from the investment cost for private minor irrigation. The
financial costs of inputs and labor have been converted to economic costs by applying the SCF of 0.90
and CF of 0.8, respectively. However, as these costs are only available in lump sum per farm, the
disaggregation of cost elements followed the appraisal assumptions. The percentages of input and labor
costs are summarized below.

Farm Models
9.         The five representative farm models described below are based on the activities for which
loans were granted under the project.
Fann Model 1:      Rainfed Subsistence Farm - Tractor and Implements. This farm owns 12.5
acres of barani area, with additional 26.5 acres leased. The main crop is wheat,
covering 36% of the cropped area. The mix of other crops grown includes cotton,
sugarcane, maize and rice under rainfed conditions. In the "with project" (WP)
situation, cropping intensity would reach 93 % at full development, 24 % more than
in the "without project" (WOP) situation. The purchase of a tractor permits
expansion of the cultivated area and increase in yields through better land
preparation. Additional income is obtained from provision of tractor services to
neighboring farmers.

Farm Model 2:      Large-scale Irrigated Farm - Tractor and Implements. This farm owns 42
acres and leases 12 acres. Wheat is the major crop, occupying about 37 % of the
total area, followed by rice and cotton, together accounting for about 39%. Other
crops are fodder, oilseeds, pulses and chillies, which provide significant
contributions to total farm income. Cropping intensity would increase only
marginally with the availability of a tractor and implements. The main benefits
from the investment are higher yields and additional income from provision of
tractor services.
Farm Model 3:      Rainfed Fann - Livestock Production. This farm owns 19 acres, with additional
9 acres leased. Cultivation is under rainfed conditions, with limited irrigation.
Wheat and cotton are the main crops. Rice and sugarcane are grown on the
irrigated land. Other crops play a minor role, with the exception of fodder to
sustain livestock. Cropping intensity averages about 150%. Livestock provides
about 12% of total farm income.
Farm Model 4:      Large-scale Irrigated Farm - Private Minor Irrigation. This farm owns 35
acres, with additional 19 acres leased. Wheat and rice are the most prominent
crops providing almost 50% of total farm income. Cotton and sugarcane are also
important sources of income. Cropping intensity varies between 150% and 170%.
The investment in a shallow tubewell is intended to provide mainly supplementary
irrigation.
Farm Model 5:      Rainfed Farm - Fruit Production. This model represents a medium-sized farm
in barani area with some access to irrigation water. The farm owns about 18 acres
and, in addition, leases up to 7 acres. The main crop is wheat. About 3-4 acres
are allocated to rice, cotton, sugarcane, maize and other minor crops at full
development.  Cropping intensity would increase by 21 %  "with project".
Intercropping with tree crops is commonly practised during the establishment
period. Income from fruit production at full development represents some 20%
of total farm income.
B. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESULTS
10.        Based on the above assumptions, financial and economic analysis has been undertaken. The
financial analysis has been carried out over ten years while the economic analysis has been carried out
over twenty years. The equipment in Models 1, 2 and 4 is assumed to be replaced in Year 11. For the
Lvestock model, replacement of stock has also been assumed in Year 11. Financial and economic
benefits and costs are presented in Tables 3-22. The financial (FRR) and economic rates of return (ERR)
likely to be achieved if funds are used as intended are shown below.

11.        FRRs and ERRs of all production models range from acceptable to robust. FRRs of farm
models 1 and 2 (14%-17%) are lower than the SAR estimates (18%-45%). The lower FRR for the
rainfed subsistence farm model is due to lower wheat, pulses and fodder areas, and substantially higher
investment costs. The lower FRR for the large-scale irrigated farm is due to lower wheat yield and high
investment costs. The ERR of the rainfed subsistence farm is substantially lower than estimated by the
SAR due mainly to lack of crop diversification and high investment costs. The ERR of the large-scale
irrigated farm is slightly higher because crop production is more diversified allowing for adjustments to
changing market conditions. The FRR for the fruit model is higher mainly because of larger farm size
and higher cropping intensity for other crops. The ERR for this model is practically identical with the
appraisal estimate. FRR and ERR of livestock production and private minor irrigation are robust.
