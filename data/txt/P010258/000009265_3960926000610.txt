Credit:  SDR 47.6 million (US$55 million equivalent)
XTems:                Loan:  repayment in 20 years including 5 years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate
Credit: standard
RelendinaTerMs:       The loan proceeds vould be on-lent to ADBP at cost,
with repayment over 15 years, including 3 years of
grace. The credit proceeds would be on-lent to
ADBP at an annual interest rate of 4X (or
equivalent under Islamic modes of financing), with
repayment over 20 years, including 5 years of
grace. The Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
Proiect pescrint-ion: The Project has the objective to further strengthen
ADBP as a sound and self-sustaining lending
institution. It would provide, through ADBP, loans
to farmers for medium- and long-term agricultural
investments in farm mechanization, implements and
equipment, private minor irrigation, dairy
development, poultry and other livestock, orchards,
vegetables, minor crops and other on-farm
development. The main risk is the effect of
Islamization on ADBP's administrative costs and
financial position. The project includes specific
measures to minimize this risk.

PAKISTAN
SIXTH AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The first project for implementation by the Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) was initiated in 1965, and since then
four-additional ADBP projects have been approved by the Bank.  The proposed
sixth project-was-prepared by ADBP with the assistance of consultants and was
appraised-in August/September 1985 by Messrs. J. Duester, C. Notha,
R. ul-Qayyum and Ms. P. Annez (Bank) and Messrs. L. Clarke and A. Schicker
(consultants). For the sake of brevity, Chapters II and III herein mainly
reflect developments since May 1983 when report No. 4410-PAK, "Fifth
Agricultural Development Bank Project," was published.
II. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY
2.01      The Islamic Republic of Pakistan covers about 197 M acres (ac) of
which about 25% are cultivated. Its population is about 95 M, with a
rural-to-urban ratio of 72:28. Agriculture continues to be the mainstay of
Pakistan's economy, although its relative importance is declining. It con-
tributes about 30% of gross domestic product, provides about two-thirds of
total exports, employs approximately 55% of the labor force, and has impor-
tant linkages with other sectors of the economy.
2.02      Recent Performance of Agriculture.  After a period of sluggish
growth in the 1970s, agricultural output rose rapidly at an average rate of
4.4% per annum between FY79 and FY83. However, this trend was interrupted in
FY84, partly due to untimely rains affecting the wheat crop and serious
infestation of the cotton crop, resulting in a decline in agricultural value
added. But in FY85, rapid growth renewed, with a sectoral growth rate of
about 10%.
2.03      Despite past gains, Pakistan's potential for sustained high growth
remains underutilized. Average yields for major crops are low by interna-
tional standards and have actually stagnated. Increases in output are due
largely to expansion of acreage. Adoption of existing technologies to
improve yields is constrained by various factors, including fragmented
institutional responsibilities for the planning and implementation of
agricultural policies and supporting programs; inadequate provision of key
inputs by the public sector, coupled with slow progress in allowing the
private sector to broaden its role; inadequate infrastructural facilities for
electrification, drainage, surface canal and public groundwater irrigation.
GOVERNMENT POLICY AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE AND STRATEGY
2.04      Prospects for overcoming the above constraints are closely linked
to agriculture sector policies. Through its National Agricultural Policy,
announced in 1980, the Goverfiment has emphasized:  (i} progressive adjustment



-2-
of prices of key agricultural -inputs and outputs to reflect real resource
costs, as opposed to restraining cutput prices and continuing input sub-
sidies; (ii) gradual transfer to the private sector of activities such as the
distribution of key inputs and the exploitation of fresh groundwater;
(iii) re-orientation in its recurrent and investment expenditures toward
optimizing the use of existing irrigation facilities, rather than toward new,
large infrastruct-ural investments; and (iv) a substantial increase in credit
delivery to boost agricultural production.  The agricultural policies and
programs rursued under the Fifth Five-Year Plan (PY79-83) and now continued
under the Sixth Plan (FY84-88) address many of the above issues.- The Bank
Group has supported sectoral reform through complementary program and project
operations, including the Fertilizer Imports Credit (Cr. 1066-PAK, 1980,-
fully disbursed), Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2166/Cr. 1255-PAK, 1982,
fully disbursed), and priority projects in on-farm water management, irriga-
tion rehabilitation, drainage in saline groundwater*areas, extension and
research, and credit.
2.05      Government has taken actions to improve agricultural policy.
Procurement prices for most outputs were increased to border parity and key
input prices were increased substantially. Pesticide distribution was
privatized, the subsidy on pesticides was eliminated, and the private sec-
tor's share in fertilizer distribution was increased. Moreover, since public
recurrent expenditure on ope;ation and maintenance (OEM) for irrigation
facilities increased rapidly, investment priorities shifted toward
rehabilUtation and improved efficiencies and management of existing assets.
In FY84 and FY85, however, the momentum of policy change slackened, par-
ticularly in phasing ou.t water and fertilizer subsidies and in broadening
privatization efforts.
2.06      The Bank and Government are in general agreement that sustaining
agricultural growth and realizing the potential of the sector will require
resumption of actions to implement sectoral policy reforms initiated in the
early 1980s. The Bank Group assistance program aims at assisting Government
in accelerating the pace of reform through a proposed Agricultural Sector
Loan now under preparation, and through additional projects in drainage,
water management, extension and research, and credit that are designed to
encourage agricultural production.
LAND USE AND IRRIGATION
2.07      Only about 50 N ac (25%) of Pakistan's total land area is cul-
tivated and the intensity of land use defined as ratio of cultivated to
cultivable area is only 64%. Of the cultivated acreage, 39 M ac are sown, and
the balance of 11 M ac is left as current fallow. Overall cropping intensity
in the country is about 98%, although it varies considerably among
agro-climatic zones.
2.08      Irrigation System.  About 38 M ac, nearly 76% of the land under
cultivation, are irrigated. The Indus irrigation system commands about
35 M ac and irrigates land t'.lat accounts for nearly 90X of the total value of



-3-
the country's agricultural output.- In general, projects undertaken in the
196Os and l¶70s sought to provide reservoir storage and develop Pakistan's
extensive groundwater resources. The Indus irrigation system, which now
comprises three major stcrage reservoirs (Tarbeta, Mangla, and Chasma), 19
barrages or headworks, 12 link canals, 43 canal commands, and some 89,000
watercourses, is the largest continuous irrigation system in the world.
Nearly 30% (12 M ac) of the irri-gated acreage is served by public and private
tubewells and traditional wells which provide mostly supplementary irriga-
tion.
2.09      Rainfed Agriculture.  A major portion of Pakistan's Land area is
visuitable-for rainfed agricuLture-because-of the arid climate in-the south
and west and mountainous terrain in the 1torth.  Rainfed areas cover 12 K ac,
representing about 24% of the total area under cultivation, and inciude about
5 M ac cultivated-by flood and torrent waters (sailaba cultivation).
FARM SIZE AND LAND TENURE
2.10      Under the Land Reform Act of 1972, irrigated holdings were limited
to 150 ac, and in 1977, reduced to 100 ac. The 1972 Act also had provisions
to improve security of tenure. Since those reforms, farm ownership has
increased over tenancy and owner-cum-tenancy arrangements in all farm size
categories from 40% to 55%. The average holding in the 1980 census was
11.6 ac compared to 13.0 ac in 1972; most farms (75%) were under 12.5 ac,
17% were between 12.5 and 25 ac, and a% above 25 ac. Farm size and land
tenure are directly related to creditworthyness. Historically, only farmers
who own their holdings and can produce a land title for collateral purposes
have easy access to institutional credit. It must be regarded as the most
pressing need to ensure that loans actually reach the target clientele - the
3 M small farmers with less than 12.5 ac and the 1.8 M tenant farmers whose
need for credit is greatest. This can only be achieved by a flexible col-
lateral system in which a land mortgage is not mandatory. Conversely, if
the quality of agricultural lending is to be improved, only viable invest-
ments can be financed which necessitates careful appraisal and constant
supervision after disbursement. These objectives are far from being achieved
in the country as a whole, and while ADBP has made great progress in this
direction, the delivery system for short-term credit channeled through the
commercial banks has major deficiencies in the form of "proxy loans" where
small farmers sign loan agreements and the loan proceeds go to the large
farmers and other misuse of funds.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
2.11      Wheat, fodders, cotton, rice, pulses, and maize are the major
crops. The principal rabi (winter) season crops are wheat, gram (pulses),
oats and millets, rape seed and mustard, and fodders (clovers, lucern). The
kharif (summer) season crops include rice, cotton, and maize and sorghum
(both as grain and fodder crops). Sugarcane is a multi-seasonal crop, but
since its active growth period is during su.mmer, it is usually regarded as a



-4-
kharif crop.  In FY84, the share of some major crops in value added at con-
stant factor cost were: wheat 44%, rice 17%, sugarcane 16%, cotton 13%, and
maize 3%. About two thirds of mijor crop production comes from Punjab, 24%
from Sind, 8% from the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and 3% from
Baluchistan.
2.12     -Livestock production includes sheep, goats, camels, buffaloes,
cattle and poultry. The subsector contributes 30% to the value added of
agricultural production. Poultry, followed by mutton, has experienced the
greatest growth, beef and milk the least.  Flock sizes of sheep and goats are
largest in Baluchistan (usually more than 100 animals), while in NWSFP,
Punjab, and Sind more than 85% of the flocks have fewer than 30 head.  Buf-
falo and cattle are raised to supply milk and meat, and especially draft
power. Notwithstanding constraints to production in the poultry industry,
such as poor feed qual-ity, high mortality due to disease outbreaks, and
seasonal fluctuation in market demand, further potential exists for develop-
ing production of broiler meat and eggs. As a first step in this development
small-scale, labor-intensive units would be established.
AGRICULTURAL INPUTS AND SERVICES
2.13      Fertilizers.  Between FY80 and FY83, fertilizer consumption
increased at an average annual rate of 6.4%. In FY84, it declined by 3.3%,
partly because of weather-based setbacks to the cotton and wheat crops, which
account for 65% of total fertilizer use. Estimates for FY85 indicate a 4.2%
increase in fertilizer consumption over the previous year. Current fer-
tilizer use is estimated at about 1,3 M nutrient tons. The balance of fer-
tilizer use has improved in the last year as evidenced by a change in the
ratio of nitrogenous to phosphatic fertilizers consumed from 3.5:1 in FY84 to
3.2:1 in FY85. While aggregate fertilizer use has increased rapidly in
recent years, there is substantial variation in the intensity of fertilizer
use among farmers. Improved access to credit plays a key role in encouraging
increased application of fertilizer, improved seeds, and pesticides by small
farmers.
2.14      Agricultural Extension.  An agricultural extension service operates
in each province under the respective provincial government. Although the
service's effectiveness remains poor and doubtful, improvements are being
made in some areas of Punjab and Sind where the training and visit (T&V)
system was introduced under two IDA-assisted projects, Cr. 813-PAK and
Cr. 922-PAM, both of which closed on June 30, 1985. At present, IDA is
assisting Baluchistan in introducing the T&V system, as well as streamlining
the extension service in four districts (Cr. 1533-PAK). To sustain the gains
made in Punjab and Sind, and to increase further the operational efficiency
of the service, a follow-up project is proposed for IDA assistance in FY87.
2.15      Tractors.  The major investment item financed under the previous
ADBP projects is tractors. The country's tractor-manufacturing industey has
developed rapidly in the past few years with annual sales of about 30,600
units in FY64, a 34% increase over PY83, but sales slipped in FY85 to 29,200



-5F-
units.  ADBP's financing of tractor purchases'as a proportion of -the total1
national sales continued to increase, from 77% in FY83 to 90% in FY85.  By
size, tractors in the 40-70 hp range account for more than 95% of the market,
while the 20-30 hp tractor, which was introduced during ADBP V, has not sold
well (only 3.6%'of the market in FY85). Many 20-30 hp tractors of the ini-
tial- import batch are still unsold. Prices of tractors in Pakistan are low,
with a 45 hp tractor selling between 'the equivalent of US$6*250 and US$7,600
depending on make. however, they are not subsidized by Government. The low
price may be attributed to the extremely competitive local and world tractcr
market situation and rigid government control on manufacturers' mark-ups.
Local manufacture of tractors by five sanctioned companies has reached a
fairly advanced stage; by value, about 65% of the 40-50 hp tractor is of
domestic origin and local components are about 17% of the value of 55-7t  hp
tractors. These five companies have appointed sales distributors thr-oughout
the country who provide sati.factory-after-sale service.
2.16      However, sizeable expansion of the tractor market is not expected
to continue, despite such a prediction in the Sixth Plan. In FY84 and FY85
"bookings" (orders) for tractors declined and all manufaL jrers also report a
downturn for FY86.  The market is gradually shifting to a "replacement"
market which means that the share of replacement sales for old tractors in
total sales is ri:,ing.  With an estimated useful machine Life of 7-8 years,
the high point in sales in FY84 reflected the need to replace tractors
originally purchased in FY77.  The share of expansion in the market has been
gradually reducing over time and will continue to do so until saturation is
reached. Industry estimates for the period FY86 to FY91 project an increase
in total sales of 4.2% per year u2 to about 37,400 units. The ratio of
re,1acement volume to expansion volume which was 41:59 in FY85 is expected to
be 82:18 in FY91. The total tractor population is projected to grow from
about 150,600 units in FY85 to 236,000 units in FY91.
2.17      The benefits of tractorization include expansion of the cultivated
area by reclaiming cultivable wasteland, increased cropping intensity,
improved timeliness of operations, and an increase in the proportion of cash
and food crops in relation to animal fodder crops. Analyses of tractor farms
of various sizes in Pakistan have shown that while tractorization increased
cropping, intensity on farms of all sizes by only 4%, on farms of less than 25
ac, such as are covered by this project, a 36% average cropping intensity
increase was recorded. Following tractorization the number of draft animals
is about halved. This reduction does not only occur on tractor farms but, in
the Pakistani environment, where the average farm size is 11.6 ac and an
active tractor hiring market exists, is equally important on farms that hire
tractor services. These benefits have made investment in tractors finan-
cially attractive for farmers and investment is expected to remain attrac-
tive. However, historically in Pakistan and in other countries yield
increases from tractorization have not been proven. It was believed that in
Pakistan the almost universal use of secondary tillage implements for primary
cultivation was the cause that increased yields did not materialize and that
only adaptive research on tillage practices could lead to results in this
area. For this reason the Fourth Credit (Cr. 957-PAK) provided for carrying



--6-    - 
out field trials by the Agriculture Research Council of Pakistan (PARC) to
compare mechanized culti"ation and tillage techniques.  Trials were initiated
in 1982 but were not completed for a variety of reasons the principal of
which was the lack of commitment by PARC. However, the trials were continued
under the sponsorship and direction of the International Maize and Wheat
-Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Their report 1/, the results of which are based
on field trials conducted on farmers' fields, indicates that mouldboard
ploughs in place of£traditional tined-tillers increase wheat yielA' in
rainfed areas by 36%, on average, and by 10% in irrigated areas (Project
Implementation File, Annex 6,.
Z.18      The negative social impact attributed to tractors Ls the *educed
labor requirement for farm work which could manifest itself in displacement
of tenants and permanent labor or in reduction of seasonal and family labor.
What evidence is available from the studies done to date in Pakistan on the
impact of tractorization on labor displacement is inconclusive. According to
earlier report data each tractor between 1966 and 1970 displaced four
tenants. A later report concluded from a survey of 49 farms where tractors
were purchased between 1973 and 1978 that tenant displacement was 0.9 per
tractor. The most recent data originates from a study, commissioned by ADBP
on request of the Bank and conducted by the Punjab Economic Research
Institute under ADBP V. The tentative results (Project Implementation File,
Annex 6) of this study show that over a ten-year period, the social impact of
tractorization has not been as adverse as previously estimated. Cropped area
and cropping intensities have increased, use of draft animals and of family
labor has decreased, but use of permanent and casual labor, especially at
harvest time, has increased. There are fewer tenant farmers, yet among more
than 100 former tenants interviewed, reasons cited for giving up tenancy were
largely related to better employment opportunities outside agriculture (72%)
rather than displacement (8%) by tractors.
2.19      Agro-Industries.  Pakistan's agro-industries are directed mainly
toward-processing of rice, wheat, and sorghum; livestock products, e.g.,
milk, meat, wool and hides; natural fiber, particularly cotton; oilseeds,
e.g., cottonseed and sunflower; and fruit and vegetables, such as citrus and
apples. Large parts of the existing processing capacities are outmoded and
great efforts are being undertaken to modernize plant and equipment. The
private sector has responded favorably with new investments to meet the
demand from the rapidly growing population and, as for instance in fruit
processing, to create the basis for an export-oriented industry. The expan-
sion of agro-industries is being financed by the Industrial Development Bank
of Pakistan, the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation, the
National Development Finance Corporation, and Bankers Equity, Ltd. ADBP has
also started making loans for agro-industrial investments, and at the end of

FY85 had accumulated a portfolio in agro-industries of Rs 672 M (US$41.7 M),
equivalent to 6%Xof its total portfolio.  Large shares of this portfolio are
in ultra-high temperature (UHT) dairy plants (24%), agricultural machinery
projects servicing farmers (lIZ), poultry and hatchery projects (11%), and
fruit and vegetable processing (8Z). Smaller items are oil and feed mills,
cold stores, implement manufacture and other activities. Since 1983, ADBP's
agro-industrial lending is refinanced by a US$50 M loan from the Asian
Development Bank.
III.  AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS
CREDI1T SOURCES AND POLICY
3.01      The delivery system for rural credit consists of three main out-
lets: the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) with a share of
42% in total agricultural lending in FY85, commercial banks with 42%, and the
cooperative banking system with 16%. Credit available to the agriculture
sector grew from FY79 to FY85 by 32Z annually, or US$85 M equivalent on
average. In FY85, 63% of agricultural credit provided was short-term produc-
tion credit, mainly provided by commercial banks and the cooperative system
through the Federal Bank for Cooperatives (FBC), and the remaining 37Z for
medium- and long-term development loans, mainly provided by ADBP (87%).
3.02      The banking system is controlled by the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) wBich, in addition to its functions as the country's central bank, acts
as banker to the Government. SBP, through its Agricultural Credit Department
(ACD), sets (i) lending targets for the agriculture sector, with sub-targets
for ADBP, commercial banks, and cooperative banks; (ii) targets for lending
to farmers with 25 ac or less; and (iii) ceilings on medium- and long-term
lending by commercial banks and cooperative banks. ACD works under
guidelines in the Annual Credit Plan drawn up by the National Credit
Consultative Council.  SBP is also responsible for the policy directives
regarding Islamization of the banking system (paras 3.03-3.10), as initiated
by Government in 1979. In recent years, ADBP and FBC have been heavily
dependent on SBP funds to finance expansion programs. As approved by
SBP,their policy objectives are to concentrate efforts on increasing the
volume and number of loans, particularly to farmers with 25 ac or less, and,
at the same time to improve portfolio quality through better loan appraisal
and supervision.



ISLAMIZATION OF PAKISTAN'S BANKING-SYSTEM
Background
3.03      Since 1979, elimination of interest from the banking system has
taken a prominent place within the policy of Islamization of the economy.
The first measures to introduce an Islamic-banking system and to eliminate
interest involved the operations of three specialized financial institutions,
the National Investment Trust, the Investment Corporation of Pakistan, and
the House Building Finance Corporation.  In'the agriculture sector, commer-
cial- banks and cooperative banks started, in FY80, to make short-term inter-
est-free loans (up to Rs 6,000 per year) for seasonal inputs to farmers
owning 12.5 ac or tess. In FY85, the limit was increased to Rs 10,000. SBP
compensates participating institutions for the income foregone. However,
ADBP, due to its orientation toward development loans, does not participate
in this interest-compensation system. In February 1985, SBP started to use
Islamic modes for lending funds to ADBP and in April 1985, ADBP also started
using Islamic modes of financing.
Modes of Financing
3.04      Modes of financing used by financial intermediaries in the Islamic
banking system cover lending, trade and investment. Those relevant to
agricultural finance are: lending with service charge; trade-related financ-
ing through mark-up (morabaha), leasing, and hire-purchase; investment
financing through profit-and-loss sharing (musharika). Of these, leasing and
hire-purchase are also used in conventional interest-based banking. Serv-
ice-charge financing does not involve interest, but the financial inter-
mediary may recover a service charge, limited to a proportionate cost of the
operation, excluding the cost of funds and provision for bad and doubtful
debts. In the case of ADBP, the limit is 3% per annum. ADBP uses this mode
for financing seasonal or short-term loans, such as tractor rental, charges
for seasonal labor, purchase of water, and developmen" of land. Under
mark-up financing (about 40% of ADBP's annual lending), the financial
institution purchases assets involved in the operation and sells them with a
margin of profit that is mutually agreed with the client. The agreed price
is payable on a deferred basis, either in lump sum or installments. Mark-ups
are generally used to provide short-term financing for seasonal inputs, such
as fertilizer and seeds. Recently, SBP has extended the concept to term
financing, which entails a pre-determined fixed rate of return. Under lease
financing (about 5%), the financial institution as lessor provides medium- or
long-term credit for acquiring assets on a deferred payment basis. The
lessor retains ownership and the lessee obtains the possession and use of the
assets and bears all operating risks. Ownership is transferred at the les-
seets option on payment of the nominal residual value determined by the
lessor. This mode is used for financing buildings, plants and machinery, and
tubewells and open wells. Hire-purchase financing (about 50%) also provides
credit for acquiring assets on a deferred payment basis. The hirer pays the
acquisition value of the assets in installments spread over an agreed period
during which a pre-determined amount of rent has to be paid with each



-9-
installment.  At the end of the agreed period, the option to purchase the
assets may be exercised upon payment of the last installment. Hire-purchase
financing is used to acquire tractors and farm machinery. In accordance with
the SBP guidelines on Istamization, ownership of the assets can be gra:dually
conveyed to the hirer. However, ADBP has decided that ownership will be
conveyed only at the end of the agreed period.  Profit-and-loss sharing is
technically a partnership between a financial -institution and client in which
both agree to contribute capital and/or labor in a-specified venture.
Profits are shared according to a pre-agreed formula. Losses, if any, are
shared in proportion to the funds contributed by each party.  This mode is
used by ADBP to meet the working capital and/or fixed investment requirements
of agro-industrial projects. ADBP has decided to use profit-and-loss sharing
only on a very selective basis with customers who are able to maintain proper
accounts and have good repayment records.
Generation of Income
3.05      The focus of Islamic banking is to replace interest, defined as a
pre-determined fixed return for the use of money, with alternative financial
mechan-isms. Depending on financing mode, the term "interest" will be
replaced by relevant terms, such as profit, dividend, rent, mark-up, and
service charge. The following principles govern: (i) compounding of returns
is not permissible; (ii) charging of penal return for periods of default is
not permissible; (iii) in default cases, the financial intermediary will
loose income for the period of default; (iv) in cases of rescheduling, the
financial  ntermediary will loose income for the period of extension; and
(v) under service-charge financing,-recovery is fixed as a proportion of
annual administrative costs.
3.06      SEP has fixed the various rates of return to be applied under
Islamic banking at 10-20% per annum for trade-related modes, and at not less
than 10% per annum for investment modes. In FY85, SBP extended the concept
of mark-up to term financing and specified a 10% per annum minimum, but set
no maximum rate of return. Under Islamic banking, financial institutions
have more flexibility to set rates than under a fixed-interest rate struc-
ture. The overriding objective in determining the new rate structure for
ADBP was to keep the cost of financing to farmers at a level no higher than
under the interest-based system; other considerations were the possible loss
of income by ADBP, due to the application of principles indicated in
para 3.05. Accordingly, ADBP has fixed the rate of return or mark-up for
trade-related modes of financing at 121 per annum plus a charge of 3% of each
installment due, which is waived in cases where installments are paid within
one month of the due date. The service charge, currently fixed at 3% per
annum, is to be confirmed each year on the basis of ADBP's audited annual
accounts. For profit-sharing, the ratio will be determined on the merit of
each case. Calculation of the service charge and of profit and loss will be
done on the basis of daily balances. For trade-related modes, returns are
calculated on balances that are being reduced each year. Calculations indi-
czte that a 12% per annum rate of return on leasing, hire-purchase, and
mark-up modes would generate cashflow and total income from each agreement



-10-
approximately equivalent to an interest-based rate of I11 per annum. Under
the assumption that recoveries wiLl not deteriorate, the trade-related modes
are considered satisfactory; however, income from service-charge lending is
too low, and profit-and-loss sharing is subject to considerable risk. There-
fore, ADBP has decided to limit its aggregate financing under these two modes
to.2% of its annual total volume of financing. Repayment discipline among
clients is unlikely to deteriorate, and may even improve under Islamic bank-
ing, because tribunals will be set up to deal with all suits in-connection
with financing agreements within a period of 90 days, which may have a posi-
tive effect on the number and volume of default cases. Simultaneously, ADBP
is expected to improve further its recovery system, which has been very
* successful since mobile credit officers (MCOs) were given responsibility for
recovery (para 3.lZ).
Legal Framework
3.07      ADBP adopted the Islamic modes of financing in April 1985 pursuant
to directives issued by SBP in June 1984. ADBP's financing operations are
governed by the Agricultural Development Bank Ordinance 1961 and the Loans
for Agricultural Purposes Act 1973. Therefore, in addition to the SBP direc-
tives, provision has also had to be made to enable ADBP to adopt the Islamic
modes of financing under those two pieces of legislation. For this purpose,
Parliament adopted the necessary amendments in December 1985. As these
amendjnents are retroactive to January 1985, ADBP's action in adopting the
Islamic modes of financing enjoys full legal cover.
Procedures for Islamic Banking
3.08      In March 1985, ADBP distributed an Islamic Banking Manual to all
regional and branch offices. It details procedures to be applied for the
most important Islamic financing modes, sets out accounting and recovery
procedures and computerization guidelines, and in annexes, the legislation
for Islamic banking, and samples of documents to be used in making Islamic
finance available. On the accounting side, the manual contained deviations
from internationally accepted accounting standards in two areas: First, from
the principle that income should be accounted for on an accrual basis, that
is, only income actually earned in an elapsed period should be credited to
the income account at the end of a fiscal year. The manual prescribed that
the income from an installment payment account should be credited wholly to
the fiscal year in which payment is made, irrespective of the actual lending
period covered in that year. Second, from the principle that total income
for each financing agreement should be accounted for on reducing balances.
Instead, ADBP introduced the principle that income be equalized over the life
of each financing agreement. A portion of income would thus be deferred in
early years of repayment and earned in later years. The equaliza-
tion-of-income procedure would have a negative effect on ADBP's
profitability, whereas the total cashflow generated would probably not be
affected, except in cases of prepayment. The effect of having lower income
in the initial years of financing agreements would be exacerbated by the
rapid expansion of ADBP's lending, which is projected to grow by about 25%



-c }
annually through FY89.' A mitigating fact r is that in the next few years a
substantial, though declining, part of  _..P's income will be derived from the
existing portfolio based on fixed-interest rates. The effect of these two
deviations on ADBP's income has been discussed with ADOP and Government,-and
agreement reached that these accounting procedures would be suitably cor-
rected, i-.e. income would not only be calculated but also accounted for on
reducing balances.
Collateral.
3.09      Under the trade-related modes, leasing and hie-purchase financing
will predominate in ADBP's- activities. ADSP will remain the owner of all
goods in the possession of the-les-see or'hirer.  Despite this change in the
ownership situation, so far ADBP has not introduced any changes in the exist-
i-ng requirements for collateral, that is, ADBP continues to ask for col-
lateral in the form of a land mortgage, but will accept up to 70% of the
finance amount in the form of a lien or chattel mortgage.  Land mortgage is
the preferred collateral, because ADBP is not interested in repossessing
other assets in the case of default after their extensive use by a customer.
Because of its psychological impact, the desire to retain at least some
element of the land mortgage principle appears justified in all cases where
land for mortgage purposes is readily available. However, this may lead to
double collateral, because under Islamic financing modes ADBP retains owner-
ship of all assets financed. Also, the existing system does not accommodate
the objective to facilitate access of small farmers and the landless to
credit (para 2.10). Under the proposed project, ADBP would review its col-
lateral system with the aim of making it compatible with Islamic banking and
more accessible to small farmers and the landless.
Conclusions
3.10      The three financing modes largely used by ADBP (mark-up, leasing,
and hire-purchase) are satisfactory in principle, with a rate of return of
12% per annum plus a charge of 3% of each installment due which is waived in
cases where installments are paid within one month of the due date. However,
appropriate covenants would: (i) introduce annual analysis of the effect of
Islamic banking on income generation; and (ii) oblige ADBP to take
appropriate measures to ensure increased profits if profitability falls below
certain ratios (para 6.09). Service-charge financing and profit-and-loss
sharing should not be accepted as financing agreements eligible for reimbur-
sement by the Bank Group, and the volume of finance made available under
these two modes should be limited to 2% of ADBP's total annual volume of
financing. The effect of abandoning penal interest appears to be adequately
offset by the system of bonuses introduced for punctual payment. The short-
fall in income arising from early repayment of principal under equal-
ized-income procedures should be offset by calculating returns on reducing
balances or other appropriate measures (para 6.09).

THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF PAKISTAN (ADnP)
3.11      ADBP is the main institutional source for development credit in
agriculture.  It was set up in 1961 under-the Agricultural Development Bank
Ordinance to cater to the demand for development credit by the rural com-
munity. Its shares are held by SBP on behalf of Government. ADBP is
administered by a 12-member Board. Its Chairmad, appointed by GOP, is the
Chief Executive. Since October 1978 when a professional banker was appointed
as Chairman, ADBP's financial position and profitability have greatly
improved. This is particularly remarkable in view of ADBP's extremely fast
expansion in the same period. To cope uith this expansion, ADBP has con-
tinually made changes in its organizational set-up.  The present organiza-
tional structure was adopted in 1985 (Chart No. 30252).  ADBP'conducts its
operations through a network of 27 regional offices and 205 branches. At the
end of FY85, ADBP's total staff was 5,403, an increase of 15Z over- FY84.  The
composition was 3,004 operational staff and 2,399 support staff, a ratio of
56:44, compared to 41:59 in FY82, a change that reflects ADBP's endeavor to
improve staff productivity.
Progress and Main Achievements
3.12      As seen in Table 3.1, ADBP's lending volume in current terms in
FY85 was ten tim2s as high as in FY79, implying an annual average growth rate
of 47Z. This expansion was made possible to a great extent through the
outstanding success of the mobile credit officer (MCO) scheme which, in its
present form, was introduced in FY75, covered 2,100 out of a total of 45,000
villages through FY80, and had reached 30,400 villages by the end of FY85.
The scheme's objective is to help smallholders and landless tenants overcome
reluctance to bank borrowing and to help them in the preparation of loan
applications, arranging for collateral within the passbook system, and in all
related administrative steps 1/. In FY85, 88% of all lending under ADBP's
general credit was achieved through the MCO scheme.  In FY86, all financing
under general credit, i.e. excluding financing of agro-industries under
special projects, will be done through the MCO scheme.
I1  The passbook system permits the lending institution to assess an
applicant's land ownership and any mortgages on the land without checking
with the Land Revenue Office.

3.13      Recent enhancements to the MCO scheme include the introduction of
functional mobile-credit officers (FMCOs), mobile credit officers for inten-
sified schemes (MCOIs), and regional technical officers (RTOs). FMCOs are
specialists in various aspects of agriculture, for example, tubewell develop-
ment, farm mechanization, or dairy development. They have proven very useful
in pilot schemes related to private minor irrigation (defined as small-scale
groundwater development) and dairy development, and are likely to be used in
the future on a larger scale. The MCOI scheme was created in FY85 to achieve
better coverage of pilot areas selected for the promotion of lending to small
farmers and, in cooperation with the FMCOs, of lending for specific invest-
ments. Each MCOI covers only five villages, instead of 25 villages under the
normal MCO system and, more importantly, operates under targets aimed at
increasing the number of lending operations rather than under monetary lend-
ing targets. RTOs coordinate the technical support of subject matter
specialists from ADBP's Agricultural Technology Department with credit opera-
tions at regional and branch levels.
3.14      The MCO scheme is now the backbone of ADBP's lending operations.
At the end of FY85, 1,070 MCOs were on the payroll, and the number is
expected to increase to 2,000 by FY89. The main constraint within the MCO
scheme is insufficient training, which is limited to a six-week basic course
at entry and a two-week course in aericultural technology. Tie lecture-type
training is geared to support MCOs achieving the highest possible disburse-
ments and recoveries -- the main criteria for MIO performance evaluation.
Over the next three years, a shift is expected in priorities toward lending
targeted by purpose and class of beneficiary. A complementary reorientation
in training must also take place if MCOs are to implement such changes in
lending priority. New training facilities would be needed to cope with the
large number of trainees for basic and advanced courses, and to service
different teaching methods, including seminars, field work, workshops, case
studies, and group work.
3.15      In 1983, an ADBP Appraisal Unit was established which, with the
help of consultants, reviewed existing appraisal practices and developed a
new and simplified appraisal methodology. Tested and found suitable and
cost-effective, the method was introduced for all ADBP farm credit operations



-14-
in 1985. However, training of MCOs in the new appraisal procedures is lag-
ging behind requirements and must be put on a systematic basis to achieve
expected improvements in the quality of lending.
3.16      ADBP technical wings have been established, first for private minor
irrigation development, and more recently, for livestock and farm mechaniza-
tion, under the Agricultural Technology Department in order to foster diver-
sification of lending and to develop technology packages that can be applied
to promote lending to small farmers. MCOs and FMCOs are then trained by
staff of the technical wings to transfer this knowledge to the farm level.
Constraints are the l-ack of qualified.technical staff and, in some instances,
the lack of clear focus.  Also, in recent years, ADBP has made considerable
progress in computerizing its_ operations.  All loan operations are com-
puterized, but difficulties have rensued as the result of the introduction of
Islamic banking and the necessity to operate two separate Loan accounting
systems. It would be useful to consolidate the information management system
in order to improve accuracy, speed in generating information, and respon-
siveness to managers' needs.
3,17      Farmers with 25 ac or less 1/ were targeted as the recipients of
70% of ADBP's medium- and long-term loans to farmers in FY84 and 75% of such
loans in FY85. Farmers having 12.5 ac or less were to receive one-third of
the share. Actual lending to farmers with 25 ac or Less was 60% in FY84 and
71% in FY85. Of this lending volume, 30% in FY84 and 38% in FY85 were chan-
neled to farmers with 12.5 ac or less. For reasons of simplicity, the size
classification of 25 ac and 12.5 ac as used by Government and in the past
pro3ects should be maintained.
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
3.18      Financial analysis has been undertaken for FY83-85, based on
audited financial statements, and for FY86-89, based on projections assuming
that US$220 M would become available under the proposed project. All remain-
ing fund requirements would t- met by borrowings from SBP. Comparative
balance sheets, income statements, and sources and application of funds
statements for FY83-85 (actual) and FY86-89 (projected) are in Annex 3,
Tables 1-3. Highlights of the analysis are discussed below.
Sources and Application of Funds
3.19      ADBP's total assets (excluding assets in former East Pakistan) have
grown at an average annual rate of 33% over the past three years. As of
June 1985, the total was Rs 11,550 M (US$717 M). In FY86-89, loan disburse-
ments are expected to grow as follows: Rs 5,000 K (US$311 M) in FY86,
Rs 6,400 H (US$398 M) in FY87, Rs 8,009 M (US$497 M) in FY88, and Rs 10,000 M
1/ Of irrigated land. One acre of irrigated land is assumed to be equiv-
alent to two acres of rainfed land.



-15~-
(US$621 MY in FY89.  These figures represent an average annual growth in loan-
disbursements of 25X, compared to 39% annually in PY83-85. Loan disburse-
ments have been and will remain, by far, the largest application (66%) of
funds, followed by debt service (25%) and administrative expenditure (5%).
3.20      ADBP's applications were funded by three main resources:
recoveries of loans, equity contributions from SBP and ADBP's profits, and
additional borrowings including those from the Bank Group.  Recoveries
(para 3.21) are expected to cover about one-third of total applications; the
remaining two-thirds would come from new borrowings and contributions to
equity substantial enough to maintain the debt-equity ratio at an acceptable
7:1 level.  Following allocation of profits to ADRP's general reserves, SBP
annually subscribes the additional capital necessary for this purpose.
ADBP's projected increase in lending can only be met by increased borrowing
from SBP, which operates within general credit allocation limits set by
Government, in consultation with the IMF. ProbLems with credit allocations
for agriculture are not expected.
3.21      ADBP's continuance as a viable and effective banking institution is
dependent upon its ability to recover its loans. A first step to improve
the quality of its portfolio was made in 1979 under ADBP IV (Cr. 957-PAK)
when an assurance was obtained that Government would not request ADBP to make
"emergency loans" in the case of naturaL calamities.  This policy assurance
was strictly implemented, is in effect for ADBP V, and has also been obtained
for the proposed project. Greatly improved recovery rates over the past four
years are primarily the result of enhanced collection efforts by ADBP through
its MC0s. Projected recoveries, reflected in Table 3.2, are based on
recovery performance in the past four years. Under ADBP V, annual
case-by-case reviews of overdues were introduced and a write-off policy
established by which long overdue loans in the inactive portfolio are written
off and the amounts written off are kept in memorandum form. The policy on
write-offs would be continued during implementation of the proposed project.
In parallel, a policy of making provisions for bad debts was also imple-
mented. At the end of each fiscal year minimum required provisions (after
deduction of write-offs) are calculated as 25%, 50% and 100% of repayments
overdue for more than two years, five years or ten years, respectively.
Provisions must then be replenished to meet the calculated requirveents. The
figures in Annex 3, Table 5 show that provisions available covered 41% of
overdues in FY83, 39% in FY84, and 38Z in FY85. These ratios are considered
satisfactory. Annex 3, Table 5 also shows the projected development of
write-offs and provisions from FY86 to FY89. Loan rescheduling is done
exceptionally in individual cases but amounts involved are insignificant.

3.22      Profitability and Income.  Since a lending rate of 11% per annum
was introduced in FY79, ADBP's income has steadily risen over the years in
line with its portfolio growth. Its net income after nrovisions for bad
debts was Rs 495 4 (US$31 M) in FY83 and grew to Rs 1,061 M (US$66 M) in
FY85.  It is projected to continue growing in absolute terms to Rs 2,378 M
(US$14P M) in FY89, but due to the negative effects of the accounting proce-
dures originally adopted with the introduction of Islamic banking
(para 3.08), at a much slower rate than would have been expected. Table 3.3
shows that the ratio of net income to net portfolio, which increased from
10.5% in FY83 to 11.6% in FY85, would start declining in FY86 (9.7Z), reach a
low in FY88 (8.4%), and start growing again in FY89. Similarly, profits,
which peaked in FYP5 with Rs 362 M (US$23 M) or 4.0% of average net port-
folio, will start declining, even in absolute terms, in FY86 as the cost of
borrowing absorbs more net income. Profits are expected to decline to 1.0%
in FY88, before starting to grow again in FY89 (1.1%). Provisions for bad
debts have been maintained at satisfactory levels. At the end of FY85, they
stood at Rs 329 M (US$20 M)? covering 38% of past dues (para 3.21).

3.23      For the first time in FY85, ADBP achieved an equity-reserve ratio
of 1:1, which allowed it to pay dividends to shareholders.  Accordingly# ADBP
paid Rs 35 M (US$2.2 M) to SBP.  The development of paid-in capital and
reserves under the assumption that no dividends would be paid and that SBP
would not contribute additional equity in the comirtg years is in Table 3.4.

3.24      The projected figures for equity do not take into consideration
the need for additional subscriptions to maintain a debt-equity ratio of 7:1
that has been observed in the past and should be maintained in the future.

3.25      The figures in Table 3.5 show that the debt-equity ratio would

reserves. The equity injections needed to maintain the debt-equity ratio at
7:1 are indicated in Table 3.6.

3.26      According to the above figures, ADBP's projected profits would be
sufficient to cover more than half of the additional equity needed in FY86.
Starting from FY87, however, ADBP would need substantially increased profits
to fund the general reserves or increased subscriptions by SBP to the paid-up
capital or a mixture of both to bring total equity to the required level.
Therefore, a 1:1 match of ADBP profit with SBP's capital contribution would
be appropriate, according to amounts indicated in Table 3.7. If an analysis
of ADBP's financial position at the end of FY86 confirms the projections,
ADBP would have to take appropriate measures to increase its profitability to
thetlevels required for allocations to reserves (para 6.09 (iii) and (iv)).

3.27      ADBP's borrowings at.the end of PY85 amounted to Rs 9,715 M
(US$603 M) of which Rs 1,446 X (US$90 M) or 15% were foreign borrowings
including IDA credits and Rs 8,269 M (US$514 M) or 85% from SBP. The cost of
resources will therefore be much more influenced by borrowing from SBP than
from foreign lenders. The cost of borrowing expressed as the ratio of inter-
est charges to averege net portfolio is shown in Table 3.8. Projections use
the assumption that SOP would continue to lend at 4% per annum or the equiv-
alent under Islamic modes. Administrative costs expressed as ratio of
average net portfolio have declined to 2.8% and are expected to decline
further to 2.5X in FY89. Average portfolio per employee has increased by
332 from Rs 1.27 N in FY83 co Rs 1.69 M in FY85.

satisfactory in general. The accounting procedures adopted with the intro-
duction of the Islamic banking system (para 3.08) would be amended to bring
them in line with international accounting standards. External audits of
ADBP's accounts in headquarters and branches are undertaken jointly by two
independent auditing firms. These audits include audits on the utilization
of funds withdrawn against certified statements of expenditure.
IV. PERFORMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
4.01      Since 1965, the Bank Group provided ADBP with US$154.8 M in five
credits/loans. The first (Cr. 76-PAK) was signed in June 1965 and financed
the foreign exchange costs of tubewel' (US$10 M) and farm machinery
(US$17 M). The second (Cr. 117-PAK), signed in June 1968, was a short-range
bridging operation; IDA provided US$10 M and the Swedish International
Development Authority US$5 M.
4.02      The third credit (Cr. 157-PAK), for $30 M, was made in 1969.  The
project included the purchase of about 8,000 tractors and 4,600 tubewells.
A Project Performance Audit Report was prepared by the Bank's Operations
Evaluation Department (OED).l/
4.03      The fourth credit (Cr. 957-PAK of US$30 M from IDA and SDR 23.75,
or US$25 M equivalent, from IFAD) was delayed until agreement was reached
that ADBP would: (i) receive an interest rate spread of 71 to cover
administrative costs and provisions; (ii) bring the debt-equity ratio down
to 7:1; (iii) improve the level of recoveries and link branch lending to

mance Audit Report: Pakistan - .hird Credit for Agricultural Development
Bank (Credit 157-PAK)."-



branch recoveries; (iv) build up -adequate provisions for bad debts; (v) be
exempted from payment of income tax; and (vi) diversify its lending.  ADBP IV
became effective in June 1980 and was disbursed in three years.
4.04      Under ADBP IV, loans to farmers exceeded US$500 M equivalent during
the implementation period, almost double the amount estimated at appraisal,
increasing ADBP's share of institutional agriculture credit in Pakistan from
=24% in 1979/80 to 37% in 1982/83. This expansion was managed prudently and
coincided with a significant improvement in the quality of ADBP's loan port-
folio and recovery rate. The share of credit provided by ADBP for tractors
and other farm inputs, was about the same as planned, with tractors account-
ing for 58%.
4.05      The credit focussed on several issues.  Foremost among them was
ADBP's financial condition, which improved markedly in the course of the
project and was quite sound by comnpletion. Recovery of current loans reached
84% in FY83, and recovery of overdues, some very aged, was substantially
improved. It had considerable success in shifting credit from large
landholders to smallholders, with 60% to the latter, a significant improve-
ment. The credit was closed after full disbursement on June 30, 1983, six
months later than anticipated. A project completion report, prepared by
ADBP, was submitted to OED in January 1985. OED's draft Project Performance
Audit Report (PPAR) has recently been sent to the Government and ADBP for
comment. The PPAR notes the remarkably favorable impact both on ADBP as an
institution and on the direction of agricultural credit as an instrument of
social and economic policy. Two important lessons are highlighted: First,
the successful management initiative to bring the credit institution to the
farmer through the MCO system has resulted in positive and frequent contact
between the credit officers and the farmer and an understanding of the
farmer's needs and problems, and second, much of the financial improvement of
ADBP was due to the low (and implicitly subsidized) interest rate at which it
borrowed.  With the improvement in its financial position it may eventually
borrow at the market rate.-
4.06      The fifth ADBP project (Cr. 1380-PAK of US$47.8 M, Loan 2305-PAK
of US$10.0 M) became effective in November 1983. IFAD jointly finances the
project with SDR 23.2 M (US$25.0 M) in support of ADBP's lending program, to
farmers with 25 ac or less. Additionally, in 1985 the Italian Government
made available US$20.0 M to finance farm machinery and equipment of Italian
origin.
4.07      ADBP V aims at further strengthening of ADBP to make it a sound and
effective lending institution, reaching an ever-increasing proportion of the
rural community, and second, providing financial support to the FY84 and FY85
lending programs of ADBP. The project supports ADBP's medium- and long-term
lending operations to farmers which, through its 1CO scheme, are expected to
cover all districts in the country by the end of the project period. Through
project loans, ADBP finances medium- and long-term agricultural investments:
tractors for farmers with 25 ac or less; farm implements and equipment;
private minor irrigation; livestock; and on-farm development.



-21-
4.08      By March 31, 1986, 902 of the IDA credit, 46X of the IBRD loan 1/
and 85% of the IFAD loan had been disbursed, accounting for 83% of total
funds.  Utilization of funds varies across investment categories:  Lending
for tractors 40 hp and above was larger than estimated at appraisal, and
funds are fully withdrawn. The legal documents have been amended to ensure a
pari passu disbursement of all categories other than tractors.  The Closing
Date has also been extended by-12 months to allow for more time in disbursing
for diversified lending.
4.09      A preliminary impact asessment of ADBP V indicates that the project
'has achieved successes in several areas: ;i) the MCO-scheme was gradually.
extended,to cover 88% of general credit lending in FY85; (ii) recoveries on
total demand improved from 52% in FY82 to 73% in FY85, and are expected to
improve further; and (iii) total disbursements continued to grow at extremely
high rates of 482 in FY83, 36% in FY84, and 33% in FY85. LJhile ADBP is still
relying too heavily on lending for,tractors, efforts reinforcing the FY85
trend toward more lending for other investment purposes should be continued.
In FY85, ADBP introduced Islamic banking modes, which changed the entire rate
structure of its lending and are expected to have some repercussions on its
profitability (paras 3.03-3.10).
V. THE PROJECT
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE
5.01      The two principal objectives of the project would be to:
(i) further strengthen ADBP as an effective and self-sustaining lending
institution capable of reaching an increasing proportion of the rural com-
munity; and (ii) increase farm productivity and farmer incomes through the
provision of credit and related technical support under ADBP's mobile credit
officer (MCO) scheme;
5.02      The above objectives would be achieved by:
(a)  improving the efficiency of credit delivery through an expanded
MCO scheme that would focus on quality of lending;
(b)  enhancing ADBP's ability to cater to the needs of small farmers
through more intensive area coverage by MOOIs (mobile credit
officers for intensified schemes); and
I/ In each disbursement category first the Credit funds and then the Loan
funds are withdrawn.



-22-
(c)  further improving ADBP's capacity to:-(6) lend effectivel-y for-
priority investments, such as tractor-drawn implements and private
minor irrigation; and (ii) lend for investment packages that
promote the adoption of improved farm practices.
5.03      The project would have as its main focus continuing support of
ADBP's institution building, in which the Bank Group has played an important
role in the past. This Bank Group support is now particularly critical, as
ADBP must maintain and improve the quality of lending, while lending volumes
continue to grow and important changes are taking place in the country's
banking system. The project would also provide support to ADBP's substan-
tially-increased program for medium- and long-term credit to finance farmers'
investments in. FY87-89.  It would finance about 84% of ADBP's incremental
lending and focus primarily on diversification of the lending program. While
lending for tractors would still represent about half of ADBP's lending,
specific attention would be given to tractor-drawn implements and private
minor irrigation.
PROJECT COMPONENTS
Farm Development Loans
5.04      Tractors and Farm Implements.  Lending for mechanization would
cover investments for low-, medium- and high-hp tractors, primary and secon-
dary cultivation equipment, and general farm machinery, such as grain
threshers and reapers. The range of low-hp tractors has been expanded to
include 12-18 hp four-wheel tractors for use by small farmers to replace
bullocks, and the high-hp range has been expanded, on an experimental basis,
to include tractors with 80 hp and above for entrepreneurs engaged in custom
hire.1/ It is estimated that by FY89, more than 55% of tractor sales will be
replacements. However, in view of ADBP's diversification efforts and an
expected slow-down in expansion of the tractor market (para 2.16), the share
of tractors in ADBP's total lending is expected to decrease from 59% in FY85
to 47% in FY89.
5.05      Under the proposed project, there would be increased emphasis on
lending for farm implements, which is expected to increase as a proportion of
tractor lending from 5% in FY85 to 13% in FY89, still very low if compared to
standards in developed countries. According to field trials by the Interna-
tional Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), there is great potential
for yield increases through improved tillage practices and the use of primary
tillage implements (para 2.17).
5.06      Individual loans covering 90% to 95% of the purchase price would
range from about Rs 46,000 (US$2,860) for a 14 hp tractor only to Rs 360,000
1/ Classes of tractor power are 12-18 hp, 20-30 hp, 40-70 hp, and 80 hp and
above.



-23-
(US$22,360) for a 120 hp tractor with its full package of implements.
Average investment cost would be around Rs 112,500 (US$6,990) for a 45 hp
tractor and tiller. As in ADBP V, the project would limit the eligibility
for tractor refinancing toloans made to farmers with 25 ac or less.  To
support lending for diversified investments, Bank Group tractor financing
would be at a lower disbursement percentage than other financing (para 5.28).
Base costs for-about 97,500 tractor loans, of which 71,400 would be financed
under the project, are estimated to be Rs 11,465 M (US$712 M).  Base costs
for a variety of implement packages, in most cases to be included in a trac-
tor loan, would amount to Rs 1,009 M (US$63 M).
5.07      Private Minor Irrigation financing would include medium- and
long-term investments by farmers to use groundwater or surface water for
irrigation. Investments would cover construction or improvement of wells of
all types and provision of pumping units (including power connection-for
electric units), installation of pumps, improvements in spring water utiliza-
tion, and on-farm water management. Shallow tubewells and centrifugal pump
sets powered by diesel engines or electric.motors would be the most common
type of investment. Deep tubewells with vertical shaft turbines or electric
submersible pumps would be required in hilly areas with consolidated rocks
and deep water tables. Typical costs of tubewell units range from Rs 40,950
(US$2,540) for a diesel tubewell of 0.5 cusec capacity to Rs 280,000
(US$17,390) for an electric 350-ft deep tubewell. Also included would be
finance for about 100 solar energy-driven low-lift pump sets with a peak
capacity of 700 watts to be used by farmers in remote areas without elec-
tricity (para 6.08). These units would have an investment cost of Rs 182,500
(US$11,340). Base costs for about 5,600 loans in private minor irrigation
are estimated at Rs 428 ff (US$27 M). They include finance for private minor
irrigation equipment of other projects supported by the Bank Group which do
not provide funds for investment items financed through farmers' credit.
5.08      Dairy Development.  Milch animals, in herds of 2-5 animals, are
largely owned by small farmers, tenant farmers, and rural landless.  They
form part of a mixed cropping-livestock production system with farm-produced
fodder rotated with food or cash crops. Investment loans would be made for
three different packages: (i) A fodder production loan coupled with a
medium-term loan for investments, usually three buffaloes (high-yielding
in-milk), dairy sheds and equipment, and veterinary supplies. Cost of such a
package would be Rs 4,500 (US$280) for short-term inputs and Rs 27,800
(US$1,730) for medium-term investments. (ii) In-milk buffaloes and fodder
production, with an average investment cost of Rs 27,300 (US$1,700>.
(iii) Three in-milk buffaloes without prior investment in fodder production
would be Rs 22,050 (US$1,370). Total base costs for about 53,000 loans in
the above-mentioned categories are estimated to be Rs 1,649 M (US$102 M).
5.09      Poultry and Other Livestock.  Loans for small-scale on-farm poultry
units would cater for the construction of sheds, stores, and equipment and
for working capital requirements to purchase short-term inputs during the
first season. About 75% of poultry investments are earmarked for broiler
production due to greater demand attributable to a shorter crop season,



-24-
simpler flock-rearing operation, and slightly higher profitability.  A typi-
cal investment package for a 1,000-bird unit would amount to R-s 51,200
(US$3,180). For the production of eggs, a 1,000-bird layer unit would
require an investment of Rs 65,000 (US$4,040). Other livestock development
investments include the production of mutton and wool from sheep and goats,
for which medium-term loans for low-cost barns/sheds and the purchase of
lamb/goat breeding stock would be made available. The fattening of calves
and cattle for beef production is a short-term activity and, therefore, would
not be financed under the project. Limited finance would also be made avail-
able for the purchase of draft animal pairs, with emphasis on draft-cum-milch
animals. Total base costs for about 22,000 loans would amount to Rs 964 M
(US$60 N).
5.10      Orchards, Ve&etables, and Minor Crops.  Deciduous and tropical
orchard development is envisaged under the project. Deciduous fruit produc-
tion in Azad Kashmir, Baluchistan, NWFP, and Upper Northern Punjab has
promising prospects for semi-dwarf apples, dwarf apples, grapes, apricots,
plums, peaches and almonds where adequate irrigation water is available.
Investment costs covering seedlings, plantings, and other orchard estab-
lishment costs and maintenance of seedlings and young trees during the
pre-harvest years for a 2.7 ac orchard of semi-dwarf apples would be
Rs 16,000 (US$990), of dwarf apples Rs 28,900 (US$1,800), and of grapes
Rs 41,700 (US$2,590). Tropical orchard development would cover citrus trees,
almost exclusively planted in Punjab, and mangoes which are widely grown in
central and southern Punjab and the entire Sind province. A typical invest-
ment for a 2 ac mango orchard would be Rs 5,500 (US$340), and for a similar
size citrus orchard Rs 6,000 (US$370).
5.11      Commercial vegetable farming, located around the main urban centers
or in specialized vegetable growing belts has potential. With the introduc-
tion of polythene tunnels, the vegetable season would be extended, par-
ticularly for high-priced early cauliflower, early tomatoes, and late car-
rots. Simultaneously, through a core of professional FMCOs, adoption of
improved production technology for existing vegetables would be accelerated.
Investments in improved production and marketing would be done on an
integrated basis, i.e. they would include supply and installation of
mini-tunnels, power sprayers, and farm-to-market transport. Also, minor
crops, such as turmeric, coriander, garlic, cumin, mint and some aromatics,
grown in specific locations, offer significant potential for development.
During the project period, with the help of consultants (para 5.16), market
research and on-farm trials started under ADBP V would be continued, leading
to identification of commercially viable minor crops that are candidates for
investment. Total base costs for about 33,000 loans for orchards (25% of
total component), vegetables (58%), and minor crops (17%) would amount to
as 516 N (US$32 M}.
5.12      Other On-Farm Development Loans would include on-farm water manage-
ment, such as construction and lining of channels and drains, land levelling,
farm buildings, and transport vehicles. Total base costs for about 60,100
such loans are estimated to be Rs 646 M (US$40 M).



-25--
Lending Not Financed under the Project
5.13      From its own resources, ADBP would make short-term loans for
seasonal inputs with estimated base costs of Rs 3,001 M (US$230 M). Loans
for fisheries development and agro-industrial investments would be financed
by ADBP-with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADO) under previously
concluded loan agreements.  Base costs for these are expected to be
Rs 2,838 M (US$176 M). ADBP's lending would also include four ADB-assisted
regional lending schemes in three regions, Baluchistan, Punjab, and Sind
which would not be financed under the project. Some farm equipment of
Italian origin would be financed under an agreement concluded with the
Italian Government in FY85.
Institutional Development Assistance
5.14      Equipment.  The Credit/Loan would finance the procurement of equip-
ment for ADBP s headquarters, regional offices, and branches, consisting of:
'i) computer equipment to be used by the Computer Department to speed-up data
processing at the regional and branch level; (ii) audio-visual equipment for
the AgriculturaL Technology Department to produce teaching and demonstration
material for the staff colleges and Agricultural Technology Transfer Centers
(ATTCs) to be set up in all regions (para 6.06); (iii) audio-visual equipment
and cassette libraries for the ATTCs; (iv) audio-visual equipment and other
teaching material for the ADBP staff colleges in Islamabad, Karachi, and
Lahore; (v) office automation equipment for headquarters and regional
offices; and (vi) telecommunication equipment to improve data processing in
data input and transfer. For purposes of conducting adaptive research,
renewable energy equipment for various applications under Pakistani condi-
tions would also be financed under the project. Total base costs are
estimated to be Rs 60 M (US$3.8 M) for equipment without the equipment
specified in para 5.15 below and without vehicles. About 200
four-wheel-drive vehicles (60 with long-wheel and 140 with short-wheel base)
would be financed from ADBP's own resources. Four buses would be procured
for use in training and demonstration activities.
5.15      The adoption of more efficient tillage practices and the proper use
of farm tractors of all sizes for various applications would be promoted by
six mobile mechanization demonstration units (para 6.06). These units would
be equipped with tractors of sizes currently used in Pakistan and, addition-
ally, with the 12-18 hp tractors being introduced as bullock replacement and,
possibly, with tractors of 80 hp and above for testing in custom-hire arran-
gements. All tractors would have the full range of implements. Total base
costs of equipment for the Mobile Mechanization Demonstration Units are
estimated at Rs 16 M (US$1.0 M).
5.16      Technical Specialists.  A total of 144 man-months (m/i) of consult-
ancy services would be financed under the project.  Of these, 90 m/m would be
for consultants with long-term assignments, 24 m/m for short-term consult-
ants, and 30 m/m for agricultural technicians.  Consultancy services would be



-26-
provided in technology development, training, and computer applications, and
other areas as required. Consultants focusing on the development of tech-
nological packages related to farm mechanization, dairy development, and
horticultural investments for small farmers would be attached to the
Agriculcural Technology Department. For farm mechanization and horticultural
development, agricultural technicians would be employed to supervise field
work.  Consultants engaged to train personnel in improved appraisal techni-
ques and to redefine and redesign ADBP's training system (para 6.03) would
be attached to the Training and Management Development Department. Consult-
ants in computer applications and, more specifically, software design,
program analysis, and office automation, would be attached to the Computer
Department and Office Automation Department,.respectively. Short-term con-
sultants would be.employed to advise on renewable-energy, monitoring and
evaluation, organization and management, and in other fields as required. If
necessary, consultants would also-assist in preparing a follow-up ADP- VII
project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that ADBP would employ
consultants whose qualifications and terms and conditions of employment are
satisfactory to the Bank and would follow the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants" in their employment. Total consultancy costs would be Rs 28
M (US$1.7 M).
5.17      Training.  Provision would be made under the project for short-term
training abroad of about 10 staff college instructors, 68 officers from
headquarters, 30 regional and branch managers, and 30 MCOs. Total costs
would be Rs 15 M (US$b.9 M).
5.18      Staff College Buildings.  ADBP would make provision from its own
funds for the construction of staff college buildings in Islamabad, Karachi,
and Lahore to replace rented facilities with permanent ones. Total base
costs, including land acquisition, are estimated at Rs 9 M (US$0.6 M).
PROJECT COSTS
5.19      Project costs are based on ADBP's projected three-year lending
program for FY87-89 (Annex 2) extended to 4.5 years in accordance with ADBP's
disbursement profile (para 5.28), and are estimated at Rs 29,528 M
(US$1,671 M) of which about Rs 3,057 M (US$173 M) would be duties and taxes.
The project costs, detailed in Annex 1, are summarized below:

5.22      The IDA Credit of SDR 47.6 M (US$55 M) and IBRD Loan of US$165 M
will be made to the Government of Pakistan. In accordance with its general
policy, the Government will bear the foreign exchange rate risk. The policy
of accepting the foreign exchange risk on all foreign credit it onlends to
financial intermediaries was adopted in 1980 to-avoid a repeat of the situa-
tion which occurred in 1972 when, following the large devaluation, a large
number of industrial sub-borrowers defaulted, jeopardizing the survival of
the financial intermediaries. ADBP will bear the interest rate risk on the
Loan proceeds.  The Credit/Loan will finance 13.2% of total project costs
(Rs 29,528 M, US$1,670.1 M), SBP 53.4%, ADBP and other institutions (mainly
Asian Development Bank and the Italian Government) 25.2%, farmers' contribu-
tions 7.5%, and the Government in the form of subsidies to private minor
irrigation 0.7%. Duties. and taxes are estimated at Rs 3,057-M (US$173.0 M).
The Credit/Loan will thus finance 14.7% of project costs net of duties and
taxes (Rs 26,471 M, US$1,497.7 M), SBP 59.5%, ADBP and other institutions
16.6%, farmers' contributions 8.4%, and the Government 0.8%.
5.23      ADBP's incremental lending in current prices for medium- and
long-term farm development loans would be Rs 1,008 M (US$63 M) in FY87,
Rs 1,152 M (US$72 M) in FY88, and Rs 1,440 n (US$89 M) in FY89. Of the total
incremental lending, the Credit/Loan would finance 98%.
5.24      The IDA Credit will be on standard terms and the IBRD Loan for 20
years, including five years of grace. Government, through SBP, will onlend
the proceeds of the Credit to ADBP at 4% or, under Islamic modes of financ-
ing, at an annual charge that will yield the equivalent of 4%. The Ciedit
will be repayable to Government in 20 years, including a grace period of five
years for repayment of principal. The proceeds of the Loan will be onlent at
cost, that is, at the flexible rate charged by IBRD, currently 8.5% per
annum, or under Islamic modes of financing, at an annual charge that will
yield the equivalent of this rate. Repayment by ADBP of the subsidiary loan
will be in 15 years, including three years of grace for repayment of prin-
cipal. With these lending terms and conditions the Government will have an
interest rate spread of 0.9% per annum on all .unds to cover the foreign
exchange risk. An assessment of the adequacy of this spread will be included
in the annual reviews of ADBP's income and profit-generating capacity
(para 6.09 (iii)). The Government will derive additional financial benefits,
because ADBP will repay 30 years earlier than Government's repayment to
IBRD/IDA for the Credit and five years earlier for the loan. The lending
terms and conditions will be included in a financing agreement between
Government and ADBP. The execution of this agreement will be a condition of
Credit/Loan effectiveness.

/f  Procurement in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
5.26      As under ADBP V, farmers will purchase trActors, farm implements,
irrigation equipment, dairy cattle, buffaloes, bullocks, and items for
on-farm development in accordance with their own choice, through normal
commercial channels, even though under Islamic modes of financing, ADBP
becomes the notional owner of all financed items until transferral of title
to clients. Prices are expected to be in line with world market prices.
Exceptions would be tractors in the 12-18 hp, 20-30 hp and 80 hp and above
ranges for which a competitive market does not exist. For small tractors,
reimbursements will not be made unless at least three import licenses for
each class of tractors have been issued by Government, or, as in the case of
the 20-30 hp tractors, continue to exist. Tractors of 80 hp and above and



-31-
the full range of implements to carry out a market test will be procured by
ADBP according to ICB following loan requests for such tractor and implement
sets from firms or entities specializing in custom-hire work. Solar pumps
will also be procured -following ICB procedures. Bidders would be required to
provide adequate assurance of after-sale service.
5.27      Equipment for use by ADBP will be procured in bulk following ICB
procedures.  For procurement under ICB, a preference limited to 15% of the
CIF price or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower, will be
extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.  Equipment items
which cannot be grouped together and costing less than US$100,000 for each
contract, but not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$500,000, will be
procured following LCB procedures.  LCB procedures in Pakistan have been
reviewed in 1985.  Equipment items costing less than US$20,000 for each
contract, but not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$200,000 will be
procured after soliciting prices from at least three independent suppliers in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Procurement of computer
equipment, which will have to be compatible to existing equipment, will be
purchased directly from the supplier. Under Government guidelines,
four-wheel-drive vehicles have to be procured from one local manufacturer.
Vehicles will therefore not be financed under the project. Tender documents
and advertising procedures for all ICB procurement will be reviewed by the
Bank before bids are invited, and bid evaluations will be approved before
contract award.
DISBURSEMENT
5.28      The IDA Credit and IBRD Loan of US$220 1 equivalent are expected
to be disbursed over a period of 4.5 years, adding 1.5 years to the
three-year commitment period envisaged in ADEP's lending program. The
figures in the Estimated Schedule of Disbursements in Annex 4, Table 1 are
based on a disbursement profile derived from the experience gained from
actual disbursements under ADBP IV and V. Disbursements in each category
will utilize Credit funds before Loan funds are disbursed. Loans or financ-
ing extended on the basis of the Islamic modes of service charge or profit
and loss sharing (para 3.10) will not be eligible for reimbursement. Trac-
tors in the 12-18 hp category will not be eligible for reimbursement before
import licenses for at least three models have been issued by Government.
The disbursement percentages in the various categories are set out in Annex
4, Table 2.
5.29      Disbursements for credit items except solar pumps and for equipment
costing less than US$20,000 equivalent will be made against certified state-
ments of expenditure. This procedure has worked well in earlier projects.
Full documentation will be retained by ADBP for review by supervision mis-
sions and will also be subject to audit by independent auditors (para 6.13).
Disbursements against solar pumps, for equipment items exceeding US$20,000
equivalent and all other non-credit categories will be made against
appropriate documentation to be forwarded to the Bank with the withdrawal
applications. A project special account in foreign currency will not be



-32-
established in this project because ADBP has a well-functioning accounting
system, makes withdrawal applications monthly, and has access to bridging
loans from SBP at terms and conditions which are identical to those for
medium- and loi.g-term funds from SBP.
VT. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
ADBP AS EXECUTING AGENCY-
6.01      ADBP will be the executing agency.  Funds from the IDA Credit and
IBRD Loan will be channeled by Government through 5BP to ADBP (para 5.24).
ADBP, as and when needed, would increase its headquarter and field staff and
streamline its organizational structure and lending procedures in order to
process expansion in lending volume. In the recent past these adjustments
have been made as required and, given the efficient management of ADBP, no
problems are expected in this regard under the proposed project.  These
improvements and the envisaged increase of its MCO corps from 1,070 to 2,000
by FY89, would help ADBP attain the overall project objectives (para 5.01),
facilitate access of small farmers to short-term and investment credit,
improve further the quality of its loan portfolio, and ensure adequate
recovery levels.
6.02      As of FY86, ADBP's entire lending and financing operations, except
for agro-industries, are carried out through the MCO scheme of supervised
credit (paras 3.13-3.14). Based on AIBP's success, Government has recom-
mended that commercial banks initiate similar systems for agricultural lend-
ing. By example, ADBP should continue to give high priority to operating the
MCO scheme and its off-shoots, the FMCO and MCOI schemes (para 3.13), as
efficiently as possible. Measures would include: (i) recruitment of MCOs
with highest qualification in terms of education, motivation, and integrity;
(ii) systematic and practical training of all staff to improve specialized
skills; (iii) maintaining the high motivation of the MCO corps by assigning
clear functions and responsibilities and maintaining the existing
merit-related incentive package that contains adequate remuneration.
6.03      Preliminary results of a study on training requirements undertaken
in 1985 by ADBP with the assistance of a training consultant (Project
Implementation File, Annex 6) confirm the need for major restructuring of
ADBP's training system. Therefore, by December 31, 1986, ADBP will complete
and furnish to the Bank for comment, a comprehensive staff training report
that will include: (i) detailed analysis of the training system, its needs
and objectives, and any gaps in skills among incumbents; and (ii) long-term
proposals and action plans for all training activities also covering staff
colleges, demonstration farms, and mobile mechanization demonstration units
(para 6.06). The report will contain annual targets, to be incorporated in



-33-
an annual training plan that will be updated by March 31 each year and fur-
nished to the Bank for information. Additionally, the Training and Manage-
ment Development Department (TMDD) wilt prepare and furnish to the Bank by
September 30 each year, beginning in 1987, a report of its monitoring of all
training activities. Assurances to the foregoing were obtained at nego-
tiations.       -
6.04      TMDD will closely coordinate with other departments involved ia 
training activities, namely, the Agricultural Technology Department (within
the Planning, Research and Technology Division), having main responsibility
for the selection and introduction of appropriate agricultural technologies
(para 6.06), the Projects and Consultancy Department-(in the same division),
which will recruit and supervise training consultants (para 5.16), and the
Credit Policy and Appraisal Department (within the Credit Division) which
will have a major role in training MCOs in appraisal methods (para 6.01).
6.05      Among the recent enhancements to the MCO scheme, the functional
mobile credit officers (FMCOs) and the mobile credit officers for intensified
schemes (MCOIs) are expected to play an important role in ADBP's diversifica-
tion efforts (para 3.13). In parallel with the expansion of the use of FMCOs
to more areas and to other investments, specifically primary tillage imple-
ments, ADBP has decided to introduce MCOIs in at least one district of each
of the 27 regions. Districts selected for this scheme would be those with
high potential for diversified lending, such as tubewells or tractor-drawn
implements. Assuming that the basic principles of the collateral system
would not be changed under Islamic banking, in districts with an MCOI, col-
lateral requirements (para 3.09) could be relaxed on an experimencal basis,
provided careful pre-investment screening and intensive supervision by ADBP
take place. However, ADBP will also undertake a general review of the col-
lateral system in the context of the new financing modes (para 3.09). There-
fore, by October 31, 1986, ADBP will furnish to the Bank for comment: (i) a
comprehensive action plan for expanding the use of FMCOs and MCOIs in the
project period; and (ii) a study of its collateral system under Islamic
banking with proposals to modify its collateral policy to: (a) make it
compatible with Islamic banking; and (b) facilitate access of smallholders
and the landless to institutional credit. Assurances that the studies will
be furnished to the Bank by October 31, 1986 and that ADBP will take all
measures necessary to implement their proposals by June 30, 1987 were
obtained at negotiations.
6.06      The proposed project will support strengthening of the Farm
Machinery Wing of the Agricultural Technology Department to enable it to
promote improved technologies through training of MCOIs and FMCOs. Achieving
this objective will be supported by the establishment of Agricultural
Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs) on the regionpl level. ATTCs will con-
tain audio-visual equipment, cassette libraries an_ books.  They will be used
in the training of MCOs, FMCOs and MCOIs by staff of the Agricultural Tech-
nology Department and in the training of farmers by FMCOs in the application
of technological packages related to farm mechanization, dairy development,



-34-
hooticultural investments etc.  ATTCs will operate under the responsibility
of the regional technical officers (RTOs) under the administrative control of
regional managers. Also, the Agricultural Technology Department will set up
six mobile mechanization demonstration units (para 5.15), and a sufficient
number of agricultural engineers, technicians, and equipment operators fully
conversant with farm machinery and operations will be employed and trained.
In-depth t-raining-of 6-8 months' duration to enable staff to function as
instructors for MCOs and farmers will be conducted by machinery manufacturers
abroad or in Pakistan, and witll be supplemented in-house by the technical
assistance team (para 5.16). Three mobile demonstration units will be estab-
lished in the first project year, and three others in the second year.
Preliminarily, Hyderabad and Sukkur in Sind, Lahore,- Multan, and Sarghoda-in
Punjab, and Mardan in NWFP have been determined-as headquarters for the
mobile units.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (i) ATTCs will
be set up in all regions by June30,U-1987; and tii) three mobile mechaniza-
tion demonstration units will be operational by June 30, 1987 and another
three by June 30, 1988.
6.07      The Credit Policy and Appraisal Department will be strengthened
to enable it to undertake, jointly with the staff colleges and TKDD, the
training of all MCOs in the application of appraisal procedures introduced in
1985. Accordingly, assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Credit
Policy and Appraisal Department will, by December 31, 1986, be appropriately
strengthened to: (i) complete training of all MCOs in the new appraisal
procedures by December 31, 1987; and (ii) to be able to modify and refine
on-farm appraisal techniques continually.
6.08      ADBP will continue to have all of its loan and financing approvals
supported by on-farm appraisals. Authority for such approvals will be
delegated by the regional managers to branch managers and MCOs in accordance
with existing guidelines established by the Credit Division. Loan applica-
tions for the installation of solar pumping systems (para 5.07) for irriga-
tion purposes will also have to be approved by ADBP's Agricultural Technology
Department. The usual appraisal report will be supplemented by data to
determine the technical and financial viability of a specific solar applica-
tion. Data will include calculation of water cost per unit pumped by a solar
system compared with other systems (e.g., diesel, electric or wind pumps).
ADBP will ensure that all loans for solar pumping systems will be included in
the normal monitoring and evaluation system (para 6.11) and that between 10%
and 202 of such systems will be instrumented for intensive technical monitor-
-ing. Assurances to the foregoing were obtained at negotiations.
6.09      ADBP will make loans and finance available to individual farmers,
corporate entities, and farmers' groups at terms and conditions which are set
out in Annex 2, Table 2. Three quarters of all medium- and long-term
farmers' loans will be channeled to farmers owning 25 ac or less and, within
this lending volume, 502 to farmers with 12.5 ac or less. ADBP's lending
terms and conditions and their relation to actual and projected financial
statements are described in paras 3.18-3.27. While the financing modes under



-35-
Islamic banking are in general acceptable, certain negative income effects
may occur (para 3.10). Therefore, ADBP would have to analyse these effects
in annual reviews and propose and implement, in consultation with the Bank,
appropriate measures to ensure a continued satisfactory financial position
and profitability. During negotiations assurances were obtained that ADBP
will:
(i) charge interest rates on loans made before April 1, 1985 and rates
of return or other charges on financing provided from April 1, 1985
onward based on Islamic modes of financing that wouLd be positive
in real terms and sufficient to:
(a)  cover its operating expenditures and charges, including
taxes, if any, and interest payments or returns and service
charges on borrowings;'
(b)  make provisions for bad debts and maintain such provisions
at a ratio to total overdues which is satisfactory to the
.iank; and
(c)  accumulate reserves tha; would be adequate to ensure, in
conjunction with contributions by SBP to paid-up capital
that the ratio of debt to equity is not greater than 7:1;
(ii) not pay dividends in any year in which ADBP's profits fall short
of the Level required to fund the reserves in the manner described
under (i)(c) above;
(iii)  carry out for the first time by December 31, 1986, and thereafter
annually by December 31, an in-depth review of its past and
projected income and profit-generating capacity and, on the basis
of the review, develop proposals to achieve the profitability
required to fund the reserves in the manner stipulated in (i)(c)
above, and obtain the concurrence of the Government and the Bank
by March 31 of each year, beginning in 1987;
(iv) start implementing the agreed proposals not later than July 1
of each year, beginning in 1987;
(v)  in compliance with item (i)(a)-(c) above charge: (a) interest
rates of not less than 11% per annum on all outstanding balances
of loans made before April 1, 1985; (b) service charges of not
less than 3% per annum on all outstanding balances of funds
made available on the basis of service charge; and (c) rates of
return of not less than 12% per annum plus a charge of 3% of each
installment, which charge may be waived in cases where
installments are paid with one month of the due date, on all
outstanding balances of funds made available on the basis of
hire-purchase, leasing, mark-up, and other such financing modes;



-36-
(vi)  limit: (a) its financing on the basis of service charge, profit
and loss sharing, and any other modes of financing that may not
generate income sufficient to cover expenses as outlined in
(i)(a)-(c) above, to no more than 2X of its total lending; and
(b) its short-term=loans or financing to no more than 20X of its
total lending or other financing;
(vii)  apply the accrual principle in accounting for income (para 3.08);
(viii)  in all cases of early-repayment, calculate and collect outstanding
principal And income-on the basis of reducing balances (para 3.10);
(ix)  continue to apply, at the end of each fiscal year, a policy
which would be satisfactory to the Bank of writing off long
overdue loans and other financing; and
(x) take all measures necessary to reach minimum recovery rates of
77% of total demand by June 30, 1987, 79% by June 30, 1988 and
81% by June 30, 1989 (para 3.21).
6.10      Assurances were also obtained at negotiations that Government
will:
(i) through SBP, make available the proceeds of the Credit/Loan to
ADBP under terms and conditions stipulated in para 5.24;
(ii) cause SBP to make available additional funds required to
implement the project at an interest rate of 4% per annum or
equivalent, and a repayment period equal to the repayment period
of the loan or other financing extended to the ultimate borrower
or recipient, or at such other terms and conditions that would
be recommended in the annual review of ADBP's financial position
(para 6.09) and agreed upon by SBP, ADBP, and the Bank;
(iii) cause SBP to increase ADBP's paid-up capital as and when needed to
keep ADBP's debt-equity ratio at 7:1 or better; and
(iv) not require ADBP to undertake emergency lending except: (a) in the
event of major natural calamity; and (b) as a disbursement agent
for funds provided by Government for that purpose.



-37-
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.11      In recent years, the value of monitoring and evaluation has been
increasingly recognized by ADBP, therefore, in future the focus will move
toward using M&E to improve the efficiency of the institution.  To assess the
adequacy of distinct lending terms for different types of loans and bor-
rowers, systematic analysis of recovery performance as a function of loan
size, purpose of loan, type-of borrower, type of collateral, and quality of
MCO supervision will be undertaken as a new K&E task. Monitoring of
administrative costs of different types of loan would also be introduced to
assist in setting loan terms, planning ADBP's lending program, and refining
the incentive system used for MCOs.  As a further task, the M&E Unit will, in
cooperation with the General Credit Operations Depiartment, develop a new
system of categorization for credit ledgers so that targeted categories of
investment can be monitored. For exampLe, tractors of different sizes,
primary and secondary tillage implements, and various sizes of electric and
diesel pumps will be part of the new system. The adoption of Islamic lending
modes will also require further monitoring arrangements.  In addition to
categories of interest-based lending now monitored under ADBP V, lending by
type of Islamic mode of financing (para 3.04) will be monitored.
6.12      In addition, ADBP will continue to evaluate selectively the impact
of investments for which it lends. At least 1% of loans, stratified by
province and type of lending, would be monitored. As a basis for examining
productivity and the impact of ADBP-financed investments, on-farm data will
be collected from ADBP borrowers and, as a control sample, from a number of
farmers not receiving financing. Technical assistance will be needed to
assist in (i) developing a comprehensive work plan to be executed by the M&E
Unit in the course of the project; and (ii) achieving effective liaison
between the M&E Unit and operational departments. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that the M&E Unit will (i) assume the responsibilities and
carry out the tasks described above; (ii) prepare monitoring reports at
regular intervals and submit them to the Bank for information; and
(iii) prepare quarterly progress reports in a format acceptable to the Bank.
ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
6.13      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that ADBP's accounts will
continue to be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Audit
reports will be provided in short and long form, will contain audit certifi-
cates and separate opinions on the use of funds withdrawn under the certified
statement of expenditure procedure, and together with the audited accounts,
will be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year.

VII.  PRODUCTION, MARKETING, AND PRICES
PRODUCTION
1.01      Significant gains in agricultural production are expected as the
development loans to farmers under the project take full effect. Incremental
production would be in foodgrains (wheat, rice, and maize), cotton, sugar-
cane, dairy products, meat, poultry, and other livestock products, and
fruits, vegetables, and some minor crops.  Production gains would be con-
tributed by:
(a)  increases-in cropped acea and cropping intensity due to
- investments in tubewells-and other private minor irrigation;
(b) -increases in cropped area and cropping intensity due to
mechanization.  Expansion in cropped areas would be largely
in rainfed regions, with a slight (5-10Z) increase in cropping
intensity because of better moisture conservation practices and
timely sowings.- For irrigated holdings of 25 ac or less,
cropping intensities are estimated to increase by about 2OX due
to tractorization;
(c)  higher crop yields as a result of improved tillage practices
through investment in deep-tillage implements (para 5.05);
(d)  increases in the proportion of marketable crops grown in the
rotation as fodder requirements decline as the result of fewer
draft animals in areas of increasing tractorization;
Ce)  increased investment in orchards with new plantings and
improved rootstock;
(f)  double cropping in newly established orchard areas (for a
minimum of 3-5 years) with high-value vegetable and fodder crops;
(g)  increased investment in improved technology, such as polythene
tunnels for vegetables, coupled with improved transport and
marketing, and intensified technicel advice by FMCOs;
(h)  expanded investment in milch animals combined with better feeding
techniques resulting in higher yields and in improved milk
marketing systems;
(i)  increased investment in on-farm poultry units resulting in greater
supply of poultry meat and eggs;
(j)  expanded investment in sheep and goats to supply more mutton and
wool,.



-39-
(k)  a one-time increase in the supply of meat due to the slaughter
of draft animals becoming redundant as a result of tractorization;
(1)  higher yields in areas for which short-term input loans are made,
particularly in conjunction with improved water control through
tubewells or-land levelling, or where, as a result of
mechanization, cultivation practices are improved, or where
input loans are utilized to increase the quality and quantity
of fodder output contributing to higher milk yields; and
(m)  increased yields of economically significant minor crops, such
as turmeric, garlic, coriander, cumin, mint, and some aromatics.
MARKETING AND PRICES
7.02      About 60% of wheat and 50% of paddy production is consumed on the
farm, the remainder is marketed through both public and private sector chan-
nels.  In FY85, Government procurement at fixed prices from producers and
traders amounted to 75% of marketed wheat and 30% of paddy output. Cotton
and sugarcane are sold at official procurement prices to ginneries and sugar
mills, respectively. Ginned cotton is partly processed domestically, and
surpluses are exported. Milk marketing has improved considerably in recent
years as new dairy plants have provided an important focus for dairy develop-
ment. Numerous milk producers, who would receive loans under the project,
are expected to provide milk to collection centers organized by modern
processing plants. In other areas, farmers near villages would market their
production directly to middlemen. Demand for milk products, especially in
urban areas, is expected to continue to remain strong. However, there can be
large seasonal variations in prices for raw milk. Fruit and vegetable
marketing is handled almost entirely by the private sector. In recent years
markets for fruits and vegetables have become better integrated, thereby
increasing incentives to producers.
7.03      The price support procurement system is regularly active for wheat,
rice, cotton and sugarcane, although it also officially includes some other
crops. However, it is current Government policy to reduce the public sector
role in procurement. Similarly, privatization of rice export is under con-
sideration in order to bring down marketing and milling margins. Ratios of
farmgate to consumer prices in a recent study 1/ were estimated to range from
45-75% for most crops and were even lower for perishables at 30-50%. Among
export crops, incidentals represented about 30%, 20% and 36% of the export
prices of rice, cotton and wheat, respectively.  Most agricultural prices are
influenced by Government intervention through import/export controls, taxes,

Pakistan", prepared for the Planning and Development Division, Government
of Pakistan, 1984.

consumer/producer subsidies, and procurement prices. Among measures under-
taken since 1980 were Government initiatives to increase some crop support
prices. However, in 1984/85, prices for milled Basmati and IRRI rice were
unchanged, long-staple seed cotton increased 1.7X, desi cotton and sugarcane
were unchanged, and in rabi 1984/85, wheat was increased by 9.4% for the
first time in two years. In 1985/86, the wheat procurement price was
increased by 14.3%, seed cotton prices by about 32 for.both long-and short
staples, and Basmati and IRRI rice prices by 3.3% and 3.9%, respectively.
Table 2 of Annex 5. shows financial and economic prices for a selected number
of agricultural inputs and outputs used in the economic and financial
analysis of -the. project.  Domestic prices of sugarcane and.IRRI rice are
above the export parity price.  The domestic price for wheat is between the
export'and the import parity price, and for basmati rice well below the
export parity price. Prices of phosphatic fertilizers. in financial terms
remain well below border prices due to substantial subsidies. In recent
years, urea production has come close to the level of self-sufficiency. In
that case, the benchmark border price would become an export parity price and
the urea price would be quite close to the border price.  Government has set
reduction of fertilizer subsidies as a policy goal. However, progress in
meeting this objective has been slowed by poor off-take of fertilizer, a poor
harvest in 1984, and a reluctance to increase producer prices of major food
crops. The timing and mechanisms for the reduction of the subsidy is under
discussion in the context of preparation of a proposed Agricultural Sector
Loan. Cotton prices are expected to be fairly close to border prices in the
later years of the project, although they are now somewhat lower than the
border price.
VIII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
BENEFITS
8.01      The principal benefit of the project would be the further
strengthening of ADBP as a viable and well-managed lending institution for
the agriculture sector. As a result of improving the allocation of funds for
on-farm investments and farm inputs, it is expected that agricultural produc-
tion and farm incomes would increase. During project implementation, a
continual flow of investment credit to farmers would be ensured, and by the
end of FY89, ADBP's share in meeting total demand for farm credit would be
substantially higher. Small farmers would have easier access to institu-
tional credit through the expanded MCO scheme, and the innovative FMCO (func-
tional) and MCOI (intensified) schemes. Therefore, the share of landless and
target group farmers in ADBP's lending would rise significantly (para 8.02).
Unquantifiable subsidiary benefits would arise from ADBP's participation in
formulating the country's mechanization strategy with respect to the evalua-
tion and introduction of different types and sizes of tractors, appropriate
implements, and other farm technology suitable for the smallholder.



-41-
BENEFICIARIES
8.02      The componenFs financed under the project would directly benefit
about 300,000 farmers scattered throughout the country and more than 2.1 M
family members. Of the beneficiaries, it is estimated that about 402 will
have pre-investment per capita incomes below Rs 1,989 (US$156), which is the
estimate for the poverty level in rural areas (expressed as 40Z of GNP per
capita in FY83 11).
8.03      Implementation of the project would generate incremental employment
of about 62 M man-days annually at full development.  Of the additional
man-days, orchard and vegetable development would contribute 41 M, dairy
development 19 M, poultry and other livestock 10 M, minor irrigation 3 M.
Farm mechanization is anticipated to reduce family employment by 11 M
man-days. Pamily labor relieved from farm operations, as a result, would be
available for other productive activitiei, such as orchard maintenance,
dairying, poultry, and vegetable farmin -, all of which are labor-intensive
and emphasized by the project's divers:Cication efforts. In addition, con-
siderable short-term employment would ,e generated by construction associated
with tubewell and watercourses and sheds for livestock (including poultry),
the planting of trees for orchards and their maintenance, and the installa-
tion of polythene mini-tunnels on vegetable farms.
8.04      Average pre-investment farm income is estimated at Rs 4,650
(US$287) on the 40 ac farm operating under rainfed conditions analyzed in the
project. It corresponds to a per capita income of Rs 738 (US$46), well below
the average GNP per capita of Rs 4,973 (US$390) in the country 1/. On
irrigated farms with 10-12.5 ac holdings, the pre-investment income (exclud-
ing the vegetable farms) is estimated at Rs 11,870 (US$737), corresponding to
a per capita income of Rs 1,880 (US$117). Based'on the above figures and
analyses under ADBP V, it is expected that most of the farm beneficiaries
with 12.5 ac or less and about 25% of farms in the size between 12.5 ac and
25 ac would fall in the target group.
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.05     -Individual investments would vary widely under the project, so for
the purposes of economic analysis, representative farm models were developed
in order to derive the rates of return to on-farm investments. Major
parameters affecting investments under ADBP V have not significantly altered.
In addition, recent analysis of minor irrigation investments during appraisal
of SCARP Transition indicates an economic rate of return (ERR) of 23% under
that project. The sixth ADBP project would emphasize new types of invest-
ments that are expected to become more important. The farm models are based
1/ Based on World Bank Atlas methodology and converted into Rupees at FY83
exchange rate.



-42-
on investment in:  (i) a mouldboard plow on a rainfed wheat farm of 40 ac;
(ii) reversible mouldboard plow on an irrigated wheatlcotton farm of 10 ac;
(iii) special equipment (para 5.10), such as minitrucks, special netting,
and power sprayers, for vegetables on a 12.5 ac farm; and (iv) development of
an apple orchard for semi-dwarf varieties on a 12.5 ac farm. The economic
rates of return are shown in Annex 5, Table 1 and range from about 20% to
more than 50%.
8.06      Prices used in the analysis were calculated in constant 1985 prices
and adjusted to obtain economic prices as follows. Local costs of goQds were
calculated net of taxes and adjusted With the standard conversion factor
(SCF) of 0.9. Labor was adjusted at a shadow wage factor of 0.8. -In addi-
tion, seasonal wage premia were explicitly accounted for in each of the
on-farm labor operations. Family labor was valued at market wages adjusted
by the shadow wage of 0.8. Economic prices for major traded crops such as
wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, and cotton were derived from export parity
price and for urea, diammonium phosphate, and muriate of potash from import
parity price calculations.l/ The seed cotton price was derived from a valua-
tion of the lint and cotton seed components and adjusted appropriately for
ginning costs. Vegetable, fruits, and minor crops were adjusted by the SCF.
Irrigation water was adjusted to reflect actual costs of incremental irriga-
tion, as derived from the average cost per acre-inch of irrigation using a
1-cusec diesel-powered shallow tubewell, including all investment and operat-
ing costs valued in economic terms.
8.07      On a 40-ac rainfed wheat farm, investment in a mouldboard plow
would increase wheat yields (up to a maximum ^: 20X at full development) and
lower tractor inputs, according to the analysis and recent field trials
(para 5.05).  The ERR is 481, mainly because long-lasting benefits are
derived from a relatively low investment cost. Investment in a reversible
mouldboard plow on irrigated wheat/cotton would induce increased yields
(about 10X) and reduce tractor inputs. The ERR for the irrigated wheat
model, at 22X, is substantially lower than for the rainfed model (48%), since
investment costs are greater and increases in yield lower. Nonetheless, even
without increases in tractor-hire income, investment is viable on an
irrigated 10 ac farm.  For the vegetable model, the ERR is above 50% and well
above the financial rate of. return of 49% (FRR), because investment items
have a very high tax component, and so their economic value is well below
financial cost. Benefits from a 2.7 ac apple orchard, if intercropped with
fodder and vegetable crops in the years until apple trees reach fruit-bearing
age, would result in a 41% ERR.
1/ Due to conditions temporarily prevailing in the economy, wheat was priced
at import parity for the first project year. Because urea production in
Pakistan is close to self-sufficiency over the near term, urea was priced
at export parity for the first four years, and reverts to import parity
thereafter.



-43-
8.08      Sensitivity Analysis.  All the investment models are robust to wide
variations in investment costs, benefits, and operating costs. Details of
the sensitivity analysis are provided in Annex 5, Table 1. The switching
values are relatively large for the major cost and benefit components of the
project under consideration.  For all investments but implements under
irrigated conditions, the allowable variations for operating costs are less
than for investment costs.
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
8.09      Financial analysis was undertaken at constant 1985 prices.  Prices
of major traded commodities, such as foodgrains, sugar, and fertilizers, were
adjusted to reflect increases in real terms as projected by the Bank's L
Economic Analysis and Projections Department.  Local commodity prices were
assumed to remain constant in real terms.  All output and input prices were
valued at the farmgate level. Family labor was valued at zero. As the
figures in Annex 5, Table 1 indicate, all investments are quite attractive
for farmers in financial terms. The lowest,-at 18%, pertains to the imple-
ment package in irrigated &reas with a 10 ac farm, assuming no incremental
income from hiring out the implement with an already owned tractor. Should a
hire market develop with appropriate premia, the rate of return could improve
substantially, depending, in part, on the success of ADBP and the extension
service at promoting improved tillage practices. Past experience with other
types of mechanization indicates that a hire market is quite likely to
develop as improved tillage practices spread.
8.10      Only a limited number of possible investments to be undertaken
under the project were examined in the context of farm models, because the
fundamental financial viability of investments previously examined under
ADBP V remains. For example, tractor purchase for bullock replacement, dairy
farming, and egg and broiler production seem quite viable, as evidenced by
their share of growth in ADBP's lending program. As the financial analysis
undertaken for the SCARP Transition Project indicates, under a wide range of
assumptions, private minor irrigation investments are financially attractive
for farmers. FRR for 5-10 ac farms with diesel and electric tubewelis of
0.5-cusec and 1-cusec capacity were estimated to range from 32% to more than
50%. However, viability and attractiveness vary according to certain key
factors, such as farm size and opportunity to sell water outside the farm.
ADBP has done important work in developing lower-cost investment alternatives
for small farmers, and promoting such options should increase the scope for
viable tubewell lending. The bulk of ADBP's tubewell lending would be under-
taken in specially targeted programs by FMC0s specialized in irrigation,
thereby enhancing the prospects for attractive farmer investments.
8.11      Sensitivity Analysis.  Annex 5, Table 1 indicates the switching
values for the investments analyzed. Similar to the economic analysis, the
viability of investments is quite robust to variations in key indicators.
Only for the relatively capital-intensive investment in implements for



-44-
irrigated areas is the switching value of operating cost savings higher than
for investment costs. In the vegetable and orchard models, where investment
involves a move toward high-valued crops, there is latitude for some varia-
tion in crop prices.  The orchard model, with its lengthy lead time, has the-
smallest margin for a reduction or fluctuation in price.  However,
medium-term market conditions for apples appear very good, and marketing
.channels are well established and offer opportunities to the farmer to market
produce with some coverage of risk.
PROJECT RISKS
8.12      As a continuation of earlier successful projects, in many- respects,.-
risks under the project are relatively small. ADBP has proven its ability
to sustain growth in its loan portfolio whiLe maintaining and even improving
the quality of lending. Sound top-level management has helped to build the
administrative capacity needed to handle high rates of growth and the implied
volumes of lending and should continue to do so. Government maintains its
strong commitment to ADBP's activities. The project's major uncertainty is
the effect of Islamization on ADBP's administrative costs and financial
position. Islamic lending involves new lending procedures and a separate set
of accounts for Islamic modes, both of which may entail substantial costs.
However, based on field observations, the specific modes adopted do not
appear to require major procedural changes, and the transition to Islamic
lending has taken place reasonably smoothly. Dual accounting is currently
being implemented and its costs are not expected to be continuous. Regarding
ADBP's financial position, repayment discipline remains uncertain, especially
when late payment penalties and penal interest are restricted
(paras 3.03-3.10). However, ADBPts dramatic improvement of recoveries has
been based first and foremost on careful screening of lenders and close
supervision of loans. In addition, recovery of past dues has been
facilitated by mobilizing the services of the local revenue authorities.
These measures would continue and are basically unaffected by Islamization.
The accrual of penal interest appears to have played only a minor role in
improving recoveries and once loans have become long overdue, it has been
found to have a detrimental effect on willingness to repay. For these
reasons, the risk of deteriorating recoveries seems relatively small. In
addition, the timely establishment of tribunals to adjudicate payment dis-
putes could even improve ADBP's recourse against delinquent borrowers
(para 3.06).
IX.  ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Government will:
(i) through SBP, make available the proceeds of the lredit/Loan to
ADBP under terms and conditions stipulated in para 5.24;



-45-
(ii)  cause SBP to (a) make available the additional funds required to
implement the project at the terms and conditions which are
stipulated in para 6.10 (ii), and (b) increase ADBP's paid-up
capital as and when needed (para 6.10 (iii)); and
(iii)  not require ADBP to undertake emergency lending (para 6.10 (iv)).
9.02      At negotiations, assurances were also obtained that ADBP will:
(i}  prepare and submit to the Bank for comments a comprehensive staff
training report, and thereafter, annual training plans and
monitoring reports (para 6.03);
(ii)  prepare: (a) an action plan on expanding the use of FMCOs and
K;Ols, and (b) a study of its collate-ral system (para 6.05);
(iii) set up.ATTCs in all regions and six mobile mechanization
demonstration units (para 6.06)
(iv)  strengthen its Credit Policy and Appraisal Department (para 6.07);
(v)  in respect of solar pumping systems, (a) have all loan
applications approved by its Agricultural Technology Department,
(b) include all investors in the normal M&E system, and
(c) equip 10-202 of all units with special monitoring equipment
(para 6.08);
(vi)  make financing available at terms and conditions set out in Annex 2,
Table 2 (para 6.09);
(vii) make 75% of all medium- and long-term farmers' loans or financing
to farmers owning 25 ac or less and, within this lending volume,
50X to farmers owning 12.5 ac or less (para 6.09);
(viii) charge interest rates or rates of return or other charges that
would be positive in real terms and sufficient to: (a) cover
its operating expenditures and charges, including taxes, if any,
and interest payments and other charges on borrowing, (b) make
provisions for bad debts, and (c) accumulate adequate general
reserves (para 6.09 (i));
(ix)  carry out annual reviews of its past and projected income and
profit-generating.capacity (para 6.09 (iii) and (iv)); and
(z) undertake to meet the financial covenants stipulated in
para 6.09 (ii) and (v) to (x).
9.03      Execution of the Financing Agreement (para 5.24) would be a condi-
tion of Credit/Loan effectiveness.



-46-
9.04      With the above assurances and conditions the project would be
suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 47.6 M (US$55.0 M) and an IBRD Loan of
US$165 M. The borrower would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
