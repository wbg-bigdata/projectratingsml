EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was carried out during the
engineering and environmental study stage of project design of the Taunsa Barrage
Rehabilitation and modernization project including a weir to be located between 800ft. to
1500 ft downstream the existing Taunsa Barrage in the river Indus as it passes through
District Dera Ghazi Khan of Punjab (Pakistan). This project is phase-I of the Punjab
Barrages Rehabilitation and Modernization Project. Approximate cost is about US$ 132
million, financed under WB/IBRD Credit/Loan.
The Project is classified as Category "B". This category is justified because environmental
impact will be localized over immediate project area. Nevertheless the socio-economic
benefits will disseminate all over the area where irrigation water of Taunsa barrage reaches.
Taunsa barrage canal system irrigation spreads about 6 million-acre feet of water irrigating
32,489 kM2, serving 11 million people.
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared in conformity with the
World Bank Operational Manual including Operational Policy OP 4.01, Bank Procedure BP
4.01 and Good Practices GP 4.01. It also takes into account the guidance on EIA which is
set out in the World Bank Environment Assessment Source Book and subsequent updates.
The nature and scope of the construction works and the environmental setting of the project
are such that many of the adverse impacts often associated with river modification projects
will cause insignificant environmental impacts. No adverse impacts are anticipated in respect
of sensitive habitat, wildlife or cultural heritage. In essence the already existing structure of
Taunsa Barrage will be rehabilitated, strengthened and saved. It does not warrant any
acquisition of additional land, rehabilitation or resettlement. There will be positive impacts
associated with creation of safety structure for Taunsa Barrage, increased efficiency of the
irrigation system linked with Taunsa Barrage and possibly water availability for additional
kacha and inland agricultural lands. During construction, the contractors' work force is
expected to be largely recruited locally, which will enhance economic opportunities for the
local population belonging to working age group.
When the construction of Taunsa Barrage Subsidiary Weir is completed and is
commissioned for operations, it is not likely to cause any significant noise, air or water
pollution or in any way threaten the normal control and maintenance of the upstream game
sanctuary. Nevertheless creation of a safe haven, between the existing barrage and the new
structure, will help the water biota to flourish. Also the water fall over the structure may
oxygenate the water for the aquatic life in the downstream part of the river. Even the use of

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
the borrow material from the vicinity of right and left guide bank is not likely to cause such
changes which may be irreversible or non mitigable.
Significant beneficial impacts are anticipated to result from project implementation. The most
important of these being a major improvement in the life efficiency of Taunsa Barrage
alongwith a guaranteed and increased water flow in Muzaffargarh Canal, D.G. Khan Canal
and TP Link Canal. This in turn is expected to boost up whole range of agricultural activity by
way of increased productivity and outputs and thus raise in the life quality of the
beneficiaries. With that the capacity to avail the services like clean drinking water, electricity,
education, health and marketing will increase. And that will ease pressure on the wildlife
habitat, Dolphin sanctuary and fisheries resources of riverian tract around Taunsa Barrage.
A number of pre-construction related impacts have been identified, most of them are
significant but mitigable through a sound design of the project structures. Retrogression,
uprooting of friction blocks, oblique river approach to barrage, deficient thickness of
downstream floor and damage to glacis will be eliminated. The principal concern relates to
temporary effect on the canal closures to make the river flow construction friendly. However,
through a prudent regulations the canal water supply can be kept at optimal level. Alongwith
that all potentially adverse impacts arising during construction can be mitigated satisfactorily
and residual impacts reduced to an acceptable level with the inclusion of suitable
environmental protection clauses in the construction contract document.
The "no build" option is considered inappropriate in view of the long term and wide spread
benefits of a safe and a long term Taunsa Barrage as compared to the short term and
mitigable impacts associated with the construction phase. Construction of 4346 long
gateless weir 1500 below the main between 800-1500 barrage is the best option out of
various alternatives analyzed.
Social consultation was carried out during project study with officials and local communities.
The aim was to solicit views on the proposed project and incorporate their concerns,
demands and needs into the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Social Framework
Agreement (SFA). Indirect women consultations were carried out to incorporate gender
issues in the social assessment.
Based on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social/Women Consultation, a
Social Framework Agreement (SFA) has been proposed. However this instrument shall be
prepared and made public when the project is approved and is ready for implementation.
The baseline data for monitoring of social and economic indicators (access to better
services, increased productivity in agriculture and better protection and conservation of wild
life, etc.,) were collected at all cardinal points in the project area.

Introduction



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
The Project shall be completed at a cost of approximately Rs. Eight (8) billion (US $ 132 million)
with assistance of the World Bank in 4 fiscal years.
1.2 PROJECT DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
The barrage was completed in 1958 utilizing local resources and indigenous techniques.
Eversince its commissioning, the barrage has suffered from inherent design and construction
inadequacies. Damage to gigantic hydraulic structure were noticed just after its start. In 1959,
impact blocks (41) in bays 39, 40 and 47 were uprooted. Perpetual damages had been
occurring in subsequent years and repairs carried out according to the need and safe
functioning of the structure till next closure. Several piece-meal studies have also been carried
out in the past but no long-term measures could be adopted to address the basic issues due to
resource limitation and financial constraints.
1.2.1 Problems
The problems identified in the barrage are as follows: -
* Retrogression
The tail water rating curve (the far end of turbulence) for the barrage site, which formed the
basis of its design, erred on unsafe side. It was observed in the beginning of the construction
activity that retrogression of the downstream bed was much more than its assumed limit. The
observation necessitated lowering of cistern level. The downstream floor level was lowered by 2
feet i.e., from RL 418.0 (original design) to RL 416.0 (as constructed) but this was not enough
to match with the actually obtained water level, thus resulting in an inbuilt inadequacy of tail
water depth causing further excessive retrogression. The amount of retrogression has varied
over the years but the levels have always been substantially low, giving a lower value of the tail
water depth, which results in aggravating the situation by adding to unstability of the hydraulic
jump and increasing pressure on the blocks and skin. An analysis made for 500,000 cusecs on
the actual gauges and data for July 02, 1990, indicates a Froude Number of only 3.74 and jump
efficiency of 37%. Adverse effects of retrogression experienced on Taunsa Barrage are
pulsating of hydraulic jump, damage to friction blocks, reduction in the discharge capacity of
barrage, excessive exit gradient and the increased risk of piping failure through undermining of
sub-soil under the floors, thus limiting the maximum head across the weir to 22 feet against 30
feet designed.

* Uprootinq of friction/baffle blocks with Corresponding Damace to the reinforced
skin
The top one foot thick reinforced cement concrete (1:2:5) skin was not constructed monolithic
with the underlying main mass concrete owing to which there existed a cleavage plane
between the top skin concrete and the main mass concrete. The mix ratio of 1:2.7:7 of mass
concrete was inherently quite weak. It was also of uncertain quality. The friction blocks were
constructed before laying of skin concrete and were not properly embedded in it. Under this
condition, the friction/baffle blocks are having a weak bond with underlying concrete with the
result that water impact and vibrations so produced cause cracks on the upstream of the friction
blocks and cause them to be washed away with a corresponding severe damage to reinforced
cement concrete skin and even to underlying mass concrete which suffers from fissure like
leakages. Every year many friction blocks alongwith the surrounding reinforced cement
concrete skin get damaged and their repair is a perpetual problem, which has to be carried out
in the limited period of annual closures.
* Oblique River Approach to Barrage
On account of oblique river approach to barrage from right, the exit currents on the downstream
also follow oblique direction. The oblique exit results in formation of oblique jets, which are
sometimes very strong and cause a haywire turbulence, which hamper dissipation of energy
thus worsening the condition in the stilling basin. Besides this, the extreme right handed
approach causes heavy siltation in the pocket resulting in excessive silt entry into the Dera
Ghazi Khan canal. The intake capacity of the canals has reduced and it has become difficult to
feed them with the authorized pond level of RL 446.0 ft. The right arm of the river has been
dominating throughout and its contribution has been more than 80% during the last four
decades. Dera Ghazi Khan Canal, which takes off from right flank, suffers the most because of
excessive silt entry. Two silt ejectors at RD 7500 and RD 20800 with a capacity of 1,500 cusecs
and 1,000 cusecs respectively are suffering from operational difficulties. On account of heavy
silt deposits in Dera Ghazi Khan Canal, what to say of passing ultimate designed capacity of
14,200 cusecs safely, even interim capacity of 8,900 cusecs is difficult to pass. The flow of river
from upstream has to be rationalized by evolution of a suitable pattern of approach for safe
passage of floods and ensuring feeding of the canals to the designed capacity.

* Damage to Glacis
Glacis downstream of the gate line is badly abraded. Reinforcement exposed by the eroded
concrete has also been worn away to the extent that pieces of reinforcement had fallen shortly
after commissioning of the barrage. Mechanical problems of mechanical equipment started
emanating which gradually aggravated over the period of time. Those are now posing a serious
threat to safety of the structure.
1.2.2 The Solutions
The problems enumerated above would require the following solutions:-
* A gateless subsidy weir is the most effective and viable solution for mitigating the ill effects
of retrogression of levels.
*  Stilling Basin on the downstream of the barrage is short in length and needs heavy
remodeling and even grouting of downstream floor.
*  Pressure pipes provided for determining the uplift pressure under the barrage structure are
mostly out of order and those few in working condition have no significance for the sensitive
and most important downstream floor. Addition of conventional pressure pipes and vibrating
wire (electronic) piezometers in selected bays/components of the barrage is a vital
requirement.
* A silt excluder is required in the right pocket to control silt entry (grade and charge) into
Dera Ghazi Khan Canal. This may have to be supplemented with widening of the right
pocket and increasing the length of the right divide wall.
*  Performance of the silt ejector at RD 7500 and 20800 and the inlet at RD 19700 has been
critically analysed and suitable measures initiated. The outfall channel and the silt ejector at
RD 7500 has to be remodeled and improved.
•  Raising bottom level of breast wall of Head regulator of Dera Ghazi Khan Canal.
*  Training of the Indus River at Taunsa, which has been handled in piece-meal fashion, has
resulted in inefficient working and vulnerability of training structures on the right bank. A
detailed analysis would require an independent hydrological study involving collection and
processing of a large amount of data and surveys alongwith a numerical/mathematical
model coupled with physical model study results. In ultimate model, the location and
orientation of heads of training spurs should make an angle of 30 degree with the barrage
axis on either side or be based upon fresh model studies.

* The mechanical components i.e., regulation gates and hoisting arrangements need
attention and rehabilitation and automation / modernization.
1.2.3 The Engineering Design
* Subsidiary Weir
To ensure structural stability of the existing barrage, a subsidiary gateless weir 1500 feet
downstream has been designed with crest level as 424 feet. An alternate site at 800
downstream is also being considered (see plate 1.1). This shall provide 8.0 feet cushion of
water over the existing stilling basin to take care of surface and sub-surface flow inadequacies.
Further, the cistern level has been proposed as RL 408.0 to match with the present
retrogressed bed levels. The upstream sheet pile level has been kept as RL 395.0 feet and the
downstream as RL 375.0 feet (see plate 1.2 and 1.3).

Presently the right under sluice has four bays there is heavy silt charge/entry into Dera Ghazi
Khan Canal. As a consequence, the canal cannot be run to its authorized discharge with
normal pond level of RL 446.0 feet. A tunnel type silt excluder will be provided on the right
pocket to improve sediment entry into Dera Ghazi Khan Canal.
*Oblique River Approach
Extreme right handed approach of the river has always been vexing issue for the barrage
operators, as it generates multitude problem like heavy silt entry into the Dera Ghazi Khan
canal and oblique jets hamper dissipation of energy, thus worsening the condition in the stilling
basin.
* Mechanical Problems
The existing gate gearing system is manually operated and with the passage of time, the
operating conditions have gone bad to worse. It is very difficult to operate the gates especially

during floods owing to dented roller path, absence of roller guards and defective roller trains.
The modernization/rehabilitation of the mechanical components have been included in the
project.
Keeping in view the above hydraulic, structural and mechanical problems, the Irrigation and
Power (I&P) Department has commissioned a Joint Venture of Consultants comprising National
Development Consultants (NDC) Lahore (lead firm), and National Engineering Services
Pakistan (Pvt) Limited, (NESPAK), Lahore, in association with ATKINS, UK Consultants to
prepare designs, cost estimates, bidding documents and contract conditions for the subsidiary
weir and other allied structures. This detailed design is a part of the feasibility and detailed
design assignment. The construction shall later be awarded to successful contractors through
international competitive bidding (ICB). The Joint Venture is responsible for adequacy of the
design while the construction contractor shall be responsible for carrying out the works
according to the design/drawings and specifications approved by the Client and the donor
(World Bank has indicated intention to finance the Project) and while doing so the construction
contractor shall respect and implement all the mitigation measures identified in the
environmental management plan (EMP).
1.2.4 Implementation
Rehabilitation and Modernization Project (Taunsa Barrage) shall be sponsored by Government
of Punjab/Pakistan with financial assistance from the World Bank. Execution, operation and
management of the Project shall be responsibility of Government of the Punjab in Irrigation and
Power Department. Funds shall be channeled through the Public Sector Development
Programme (PSDP) of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Project was cleared by the Punjab
Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) on 21St April, 2003 for submission to CDWP.
For implementation the l&P Department has created a Project Management Organization
(PMO) headed by Unit Head, Project Manager who is assisted by a Supervision Consultants
and other required staff as per details given in the PC-I (see Organogram at Figure 8-1).
Initially, an Environment unit (EU) will be created within PMO for the Project implementation
period. After that the l&P Department will take over the operational phase and make
arrangement to carry on the function of EU.

1.5 PUBLIC CONSULTATION
Three phased consultation programme was undertaken:
Phase 1: Consisted of meetings and discussion with local and regional officials.
Phase 2: It involved the undertaking of a programme of semi-structured discussions in
communities in the project area of influence. This included both community discussion and
discussion with women through village elders or women teachers.
Phase 3: Consisted of formal Public Hearing under Environmental Protection Act Section 12 at
a central place in the area of influence of the project (See details in Chapter 6).
1.6 WOMEN CONSULTATION
Taunsa Barrage is located in District Muzaffargarh, which is a conservative society where direct
access to women folk for social surveys like, this is not possible. Through the community elders
and women school teachers an access could be made to women in the selected localities who
would not like to get their names recorded. The women consultation was carried out according
to "Gender Issue Study" commissioned by the World Bank and is considered to be an essential
part of the project preparation.
The world Bank study and its objectives clearly overlap those required out of the current study,
which also include the Gender Impact Assessment (See details in Chapter 6).
1.7 ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESETTLEMENT ISSUES
The project activities include construction of subsidiary gateless weir (4346 long, 238 wide and
elevation RL 426) and some allied structure within the river. This will, of course, involve borrow
material, camping ground, material dumps and machinery yard. And the material and labour
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                     1-10



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
shall have to be carried to the construction site. In doing all these activities no private land or
property is involved anywhere. An old workshop site alongwith 46 acres of open land are
enough for labour camp, material storage and machinery yard. For carriage of material, the
existing metalled road supported by existing link roads from old workshop and roads on two
downstream bunds shall be adequate. The sub-weir and allied structure shall be constructed
within the river flow. So, no land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation is involved at any
stage of the project construction or operation. Also within this self contained project no serious
environmental adverse effects are anticipated. Therefore, no significant environmental and
resettlement issues exist in this project.
1.8 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 makes it mandatory for the project
components to carry out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of development projects
and incorporate environmental and social mitigation action as part of project planning. The
status of projects regulatory clearance is outlined in Section 2.1. The National Environment
Quality Standards (NEQS) define the limits for pollutants in Air, Water and Soil from various
sources. Extending NEQS' to the air and water quality in project area is presently under
consideration. Although there are no land acquisition, resettlement or rehabilitation issues, yet it
is noteworthy that the Land Acquisition Act 1894, regulates the acquisition of lands and built up
property, and damage to other assets such as; crops, tees and infrastructure. The Resettlement
Policy (draft) of the Government of Pakistan, when finalized and promulgated, would address
the rehabilitation and resettlement of disrupted population and restoration of their livelihood,
providing a basis for managing the resettlement needs arising from any project.
1.9 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLING DESIGN
Although the main structure to be build is a gateless weir (a sill) to be constructed across the
river, yet it will require some support structures and will influence the entire flow of the river to
an extent that it is necessary to undertake the upstream and downstream study. For that
purpose the entire area of influence of the project was divided into following study areas:
1 )   The main gateless weir (sill) and the area between old structure and new weir (A).
2)    The area downstream beyond the main weir (B)
3)    The old barrage (C)
4)    The game sanctuary above stream (D)
5)    The upstream area and structures other than the sanctuary (E) (See Project Map at
Figure 3-1).

Each area, being different from each other would require different methodology. However the
local variations in physiography soil and microclimate were accommodated through a multi-
stage stratified proportionate sampling and adequate number of samples from different strata
were obtained. The impact studied (as and where applicable) were the terrain, topography, rock
& soil, temperature, rainfall, hydrology, air quality, noise pollution, major land use, agriculture,
flora, fauna, livestock, cultural resources, and archaeological resources. The socio-economic
and cultural aspects included sociological characteristics of potential beneficiaries / affectees,
identification of vulnerable groups, ethnic population, poverty level, social organization and
access to social infrastructure including health, education and other social indicators prevalent
in the project area.
For each study area, the study was divided into stage as follows:

2. POLICY LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
This section provides an overview of the policy framework and national legislation that applies
to the proposed Project. The Project is expected to comply with all national legislation relating
to environment in Pakistan and to obtain all regulatory clearances required. The Project at the
same time conforms to the World Bank Operational manual 4.01.
2.1 NATIONAL POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
The Pakistan National Conservation Strategy (NCS) that was approved by federal cabinet\ in
March 1992 is the principal policy document on environment issues in the country. The NCS
outlines the country's primary approach towards encouraging sustainable development,
conserving natural resources and management of resources. The NCS has 68 specific
programmers in 14 core area in which policy intervention is considered crucial for preservation
of Pakistan's natural and physical environment. The core areas that are relevant in the context
of the proposed Project are pollution prevention and abatement, conserving biodiversity,
protecting the wildlife game sanctuary (which is also a RAMSAR site) and preservation of
cultural heritage.
Two organizations, Pakistan Environmental protections council (PEPC) and the Pakistan
Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) are primarily responsible for administering the
provisions of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997. The PEPC oversees the
functioning of the Pak-EPA. Its members are representatives of the government, industry, non
governmental organization, and the private sector. The Pak-EPA is required to ensure
compliance with NEQS and established monitoring and evaluation system. As the primary
implementation agency in the hierarchy, it is responsible for identifying the need for, as well as,
inviting legislation whenever necessary. The Pak-EPA is also authorized to delegate powers to
its provincial counterparts, the provincial EPAS (environmental protection agencies) one of the
functions delegated by the Pak-EPA to provincial EPAS is the review and approval of
environmental assessment reports of projects undertaken in their respective jurisdictions.
2.2 THE PAKISTAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1997
The Pakistan Environmental Act, 1997, empowers the Pak-EPA to:-
*  Delegate powers, including those of environmental assessment, to provincial EPAS
*  Identify categories of projects to which the IEE/EIA provision will apply
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                      2-1



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
*  Develop guidelines for conducting initial Environmental Examination (IEE) and EIAS and
procedures for the submission review and approval of the same.
*  Develop environmental emission standard for various parameters such as air, water and
noise.
*  Enforce the provision of the Act through environmental protection order and environmental
tribunals' headed by magistrates with wide ranging powers including the right to fine
violators of the Act.
Under the provision of 1997 Act, the Pak EPA has empowered four provincial EPAS to manage
the environmental concerns of their respective provinces. The provincial EPAS can frame
environmental regulations tailored to the requirements of their provinces, provided these
regulations meet or exceed the minimum standards set by EPA. They are also required to
review and approve EIAS of all development projects undertaken in their respective provinces,
including those projects implemented by federal agencies.
2.3 REGULATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Under section 12 (and subsequent amendment) of 1997 Act, a Project falling under any
category specified in schedule I (SRD 339, 10/2000), requires proponent to file an IEE with
concerned federal agency (Pak-EPA). Projects falling under any category specified in schedule
11 require the proponent to file an EIA with the federal agency. Within ten working days of the
IEE or EIA having been deposited the federal agency will confirm that the document submitted
is complete for the purpose of review. During this time should the federal agency require the
proponents for revision, clearly citing those aspects that need further discussion. Subsequently,
the federal agency shall make every effort to complete IEE review within 45 days and an EIA
within 90 days of filing.
Pak-EPA regulation (SRO 339(1)/2000) states that an IEE is required for federal or provincial
projects (expect in case of maintenance, rebuilding or reconstruction of existing structure) with
a total cost of less than 4.50 million. An EIA, on the other hand is required for federal or
provincial projects (except in the case of maintenance, rebuilding, or reconstruction case) with a
total cost of Rs 50 million or more. EIAS are also required in cases where projects are to be
implemented in environmentally sensitive areas, or are likely to cause adverse environmental
affects.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Recognizing that the Pak-EPA has delegated powers to provincial EPAS to enforce the
provision of 1997 Act, an EIA must be submitted to the provincial agencies in whose jurisdiction
the project falls which in this case is the Punjab Environmental Protection Agency, At the time
of application, the Project proponent is also required to pay a specified fee to the concerned
EPA.
2.4 GUIDE LINES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Pak-EPA has published environmental guidelines for preparation and review of environmental
reports which includes the nature of information to be included in the projects. The guidelines
have been duly followed while preparing this report.
2.5 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY STANDARDS (NEQS) 2000
The National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) 2000 specify the following standards:
*  Maximum allowable concentration of pollutants, (32 parameters) in emission and liquid
industrial effluents discharged to inland water.
*  Maximum allowable concentration of pollutants (16 parameters) in gaseous emission
*  Maximum allowable concentration of pollutants, (two parameters) in gaseous emission from
vehicle exhaust and noise emission from vehicles
*  Maximum allowable noise level from vehicles
These standards apply to the gaseous emission and liquid effluents discharged by batching
plants, campsite and construction machinery. The standards for vehicle will apply during the
construction as well as operation phase of the project. Precise standards for air quality are still
awaited.
2.6 INTERACTION WITH OTHER AGENCIES
Irrigation and Power Department, Government of Punjab, is responsible for ensuring that the
Project complies with laws and regulations controlling the environmental concerns of Barrage
construction and operation and that all preconstruction requisites are met. This section
describes the nature of relationship between Irrigation and Power Department and concerned
line agencies.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
* Federal and Provincial EPAS
The Irrigation and Power Department will be responsible for providing complete environmental
documentation required by Pak-EPA and provincial EPAS and remain committed to the
approved project design. No deviation is permitted during Project implementation without the
prior and explicit permission of the EPA Punjab.
* Provincial Departments of Forests and Wildlife
It is expected that project implementation will not require any major clearance of the vegetation
and trees within the Project area. Should it become necessary at my stage the Project
contractor will be responsible for obtaining a "No-objection certificate" (NOC) from the Forest
Department. The application for an NOC will need to be endorsed by l&P Department. Since
the Construction will take place in close proximity to a wildlife sanctuary (which is also a
RAMSAR site, the Irrigation and Power Department is required to coordinate with the Wildlife
Department to ensure that impacts on vegetation and wildlife are minimal.
* Provincial Revenue Departments
Under the national law, matters relating to land use and ownership are provincial subjects and
the Revenue Department Punjab is empowered to carry out acquisition of private land or built
up property for the public purpose. Since no land acquisition, settlement or rehabilitation is
required in the instant case the Irrigation and Power Department shall not have to move any
application to the revenue department in this regard.
* Local Government and Municipalities
If some resettlement, removal of any environmental hazard or any source of congestion or
pollution is involved it becomes necessary to contact the local government or Municipalities
Since no such matter exists in this project, so the l&P Department shall not be required to
correspond with the local Government and Municipalities in this regard.
2.7 OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED STATUTES
This section outlines statutes, other than Pakistan Environment Protection Act, 1997, which are
relevant to the Project.

Taunsa is a RAMSAR site for waterfowls and Pakistan is signatory to the RAMSAR convention.
This Convention enjoins upon signatory factions to provide and protect the habitats of migratory
waterfowl. Accordingly Taunsa water reservoir was declared as a wildlife sanctuary. Irrigation
and Power Department requested Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Punjab to issue No
Objection Certificate (NOC) in consultation with Public, the wildlife Department and the
Fisheries Department. Since the construction of the sub weir and all the allied activities shall
take place downstream the main barrage, it will fall outside the RAMSAR site as well as the
wildlife sanctuary. The EPA has issued the NOC (Sea Annex-IV).

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.1 CONTEXT
Taunsa Barrage was constructed over a period of five years (1953-1958) Indus River at a
suitable site about 15 Km from Kot Addu. It takes its name from a town named Taunsa situated
about 30 Km upstream from the barrage site. Over past 50 years, the Barrage has facilitated an
efficient flow of irrigation water in three major canals; Muzaffargarh Canal (Discharge 8,300
cusecs), Dera Ghazi Khan Canal (Discharge 8,900 cusecs) and Taunsa-Panjnad (T-P) Link
Canal (Discharge 12,000 cusecs) supply some 6 million acre feet of irrigation water to the
cultivated lands in Districts of Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and
Bahawalpur, during "Rabi" as well as "Kharif' season. Barrage Engineers opine that ordinarily
the Barrages like Taunsa have an efficient "life" of about 50 years beyond which some old age
symptoms start showing up. The major problem has been caused by the inadequacy of the tail
water rating curve the extent of turbulence, for the barrage site. The canals taking off from
Taunsa Barrage being economic arteries for the area, the option of a damaged or dysfunctional
model is not acceptable. It is not possible to replace the structure with a new one in view of
financial constrains.
In fact, due to resource limitations and financial constraints, Taunsa Barrage has suffered from
inherent design and construction inadequacies. Damage to this gigantic hydraulic structure
were noticed just after its commissioning. In 1959 impact blocks (41) in Bay 39, 40 and 47 were
uprooted. Perpetual damages had been occurring in subsequent years and repairs carried out
according to the need and safe functioning of the structure on interim basis. The main problem
has been the tail water rating curve the extent of turbulence for the barrage site, which formed
the basis of its design, and which erred on the unsafe side. It led to retrogression of the
downstream much more than it was assumed. The downstream floor level was lowered by 2
feet i.e., from RL 418 (original design) to RL 416 (as constructed) but it was not enough to
match the actually obtained water level, thus resulting in an inbuilt inadequacy of tail water
depth causing further excessive retrogression. Hydraulic researchers have reported that the
adverse effects of the retrogression experienced on Taunsa Barrage are pulsating hydraulic
jump, damage to friction blocks, reduction in the discharge capacity of the Barrage, excessive
exit gradient and increased risk of piping failure through undermining.
The best option, therefore, is to lengthen the life of the Barrage by another 50 years by
modernizing the mechanism of the gate system and to mitigate if not eliminate, the erosion
process in the River bed, below the existing weir by constructing a 4,346 feet long gateless

weir, across the River, 800-1500 of feet from the base of the existing weir. The gateless weir
will cause partial blockage of water and by creation of a relatively static block of water the water
flow will come near the surface and the water will spill over the gateless weir and continue
flowing downstream. This EIA pertains to the construction at the gateless weir as explained
above.
3.2 PROJECT LOCATION AND DIMENSIONS
Taunsa Barrage, built over River Indus is located at 300 31 N and 700 51 E in the south-west
part of the Punjab in Tehsil Kot Adu of District Muzaffargarh. An arterial road linking western
part of the Province also crosses over the Barrage besides a rail link for Quetta and Karachi
and a sui gas main pipe line (See plates 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5).

The proposed project is a 4,346 feet sill or a subsidiary weir 800-1,500 feet downstream has
been proposed with crest level as 424.00 feet. This shall provide 8.00 feet cushion of water
over the existing stilling basin to take care of the surface and sub-surface flow inadequacies.
Further, the cistern level has been proposed as RL 408.0 feet to match with the present
retrogressed bed level. The upstream sheet pile level has been kept at 395.0 feet and the
downstream as RL 375.0 feet. Alongwith this main structure, remodeling of right pocket,
deflection spur for correction of the oblique river approach and undertaking of some mechanical
works has been included in the Project (See Figure 3-1 for elevation of the weir).
3.3 MAIN FEATURES OF THE PROJECT
The Taunsa barrage has a designed capacity of 1 000,000 cusecs. It comprises:
* Seven (7) left under sluice bays (Span 60 ft each)
*  Four (4) right under sluice bays (Span 60 ft each)
*  Fifty three (53) main weir bays (Span 60 ft each)
*  Fish ladders of 1 1 ft span on left and right flanks.

(See plates 3.1 to 3.6)
3.4 FIELD INVESTIGATION
Field investigations depict the following picture: -
* River oblique approach:
River approach remains persistently right handed and flow patterns do not change with
variation in discharge this has been necessitating deviation this has been wedge type
regulation.
* Downstream Right under sluice area developing cavities
There are voids in sub surface interpreted depth of cavities/solution channels varies from 9
to 13 ft. from general surface and width varies from 5 to 8 ft.
* Downstream Main Weir Area developing Cavities
There are voids in the subsurface with interpreted depth varying from 6 to 1Oft. indicating
presence of voids/cavities within and just below concrete mass.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
!  Downstream Left under sluice Area developing Weak Zones and Cavities:
Cavities have been observed in bays # 2,3,4 and 5. Drilling has confirmed presence of large
cavities and crack, in concrete mass. Gravity surveys show better sub-surface condition in
bays # 6+7.
* Pressure Pipes and uplift pressure
Pressure pipes are malfunctioning and are unreliable.
* Bridge on Taunsa Barrage and Canal Head Regulators
The bridges on barrage and canals head regulations are safe for class A, NLC and 70 Ton
Tank loadings.
* Sub-Surface Condition
General investigations for foundation alluvium indicate that there are locations where
separation loose contact of downstream floor with the foundation alluvium or even cavities
can be expected.
* Downstream Flow Conditions
Downstream the Taunsa Barrage, there has been exercise retrogression of the riverbed
downstream of basin, which has caused serious drop in the tail water level (the end part of
the high velocity flow coming out of the under sluice bay). As a result, the stilling basin (the
area where energy of falling water is dissipated) has been rendered shorter than required
and its floor level higher than required, and hence the energy dissipation is incomplete. The
tail water level needs to be restored to original values for which the stilling basin was
designed.
* Physical Health of Barrage Components:
The barrage has been suffering from serious hydraulic problems ever since its construction.
Added to that are the above-enumerated problems. Cumulatively all these factors have
caused structural inadequacy and deteriorated stilling basin and down stream left sidewall

*  One silt ector on Muzaffargarth canal at RD 4,418 and the other at D.G. Khan canal
at RD 20,800 were originally provided for extracting substantial quantity of silt from
the two canals. The ejector on D.G. Khan Canal after running for a few reasons lost
its function because of choking of it, outfall channel, which was about 18 miles (27
Kms) long. Need for another silt of ejector at better location was therefore felt. On
recommendation of Irrigation Research institute (IRI) the second sit ejector was
constructed in 1974 at RD 7,500.
*  Twenty (20) cross drawings structures; Sixteen (16) syphons three (3) super passage
and one siphon aqueduct are provided on D.G. Khan canal to safely pass flood water
of hill torresits under/over the mountains. Discharge of torrents at canal crossing sites

The above schedule is subject to following conditions:
(i)   The PC-I is cleared by CDWP and EAD
(ii)  Funds are released well in time
(iii)  A well set Project. Monitoring Plan is included in the Project Plan
3.9 CONSTRUCTION LOGISTICS
3.9.1 Labour Camps
It has been estimate that following shall be the nominal requirements for various classes of
workers/Labour.
1.    Skilled Workers  = 200
2.    Semiskilled     = 300
3.    Unskilled       = 1500
Total           = 2000
(Also see table 6.4)
At least 70% of the labour shall have to accommodated on the labour camp established by the
contractor. Other 30% of the labour will come and go to their nearby homes. Preferably all
unskilled labour shall be employed locally but most of them will like to avail free facility at the
camp.
An old workshop located on the left bank at a distance of 1 km from the main road and 4 Km
from the work site has been proposed as the labour camp. The accommodation can be
arranged by repairing the existing workshop buildings, and if required, partly by constructing
temporary hutments on adjacent open land owned by Irrigation & Power Department. An old

mosque and a dispensary already exist nearby. Other facilities can be provided by the
contractors which may also include daily sprinkling of water on 1 km long kacha link road, a ban
on culting of trees, fence around the labour camp and providing hygienic environment to the
labour camp. Sub-soil water on the labour campsite is sweet and the site is not near any village.
The site can facilitate establishment of a field office for the Resident Engineer (RE) and his
Assistants, as well as the contractor. That would facilitate any easy command and control
system. (See plates 3.6, 3.8,3.7,3.9,3.11,3.12). Also see project map for logistics (Figure 3-2).

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Adjacent to the old workshop, now proposed as a labour camp there is an Irrigation & Power
Department land, area 46 acres, part of which has been offered as an Equipment yard. The site
is easily accessible easily through the same link road which connects the labour camp to the
main road. Located in the open and away from any habitation, the yard is likely to cause
minimum environment impacts. The access road, however, may have to be graded, watered
and compacted from time to time to ensure a dust free by the machinery. If necessary
temporary sheds can be constructed, on the yard site, for keeping the machinery safe from the
weather effects. Being close to the labour camp and the command and control centre of the
field operations, security and supervision shall pose no problems (See plate 3.7, 3.110).
3.9.3 Material Depots
On part of 46 acres of Irrigation & Power Department land, as per mutual understanding to be
reached between the RE and the contractor, the contractor can be allowed to dump his
construction materials. As per convenience of the contractor, the mixing can be done within the
depot and then conveyed to the construction site, from where it can be conveyed to exact
construction point by conveyor belts or suction pipes. If such a practice is resorted to, it may
add additional load on the kacha link road from the camp site to the main road. For that an
additional provision can be made for good maintenance of the link road. Being close to the RE's
field office, the arrangement would facilitate an effective quality control and convenient
monitoring of the progress (see plate 3.1 1).
3.9.4 Work Bases
Two work bases have been proposed towards the ends of the two guide banks, downstream
the existing barrage. The left guide bank (see plate 3.13) ends near fishermen huts and the
right bank ends at a short distance from village Faqirwali. From main road, the roads on tops of
the guide bunds (after a little widening) shall be used to convey materials from main road to the
construction points. Both the work bases are located on Irrigation & Power land, and the roads
on top of the two guide bunds are also on the Irrigation & Power lands, so no social problem is
expected at any stage. Also the construction points shall be virtually delivery point for the mix
material, so no pollution is expected to be caused to the ambient air, water or land. Modification
and maintenance of the surface of the bunds shall have to be done to ensure a dust free use
during dry weather and mud free trafficability during rainy season. There are no permit or
temporary habitation along the route or near it or on the work place.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
3.9.5 Approaches to Work Site
The RE's office, contractors camp, the labour camp, machinery yard and material depot, shall
all be located in an around the abandoned workshop site and will also occupy part of Irrigation
& Power Department land located adjacent to the old workshop. From there the men,
machinery and materials shall be conveyed to the existing Kot Addu-Taunsa double lane
metalled road via 1 Km kacha road. After traveling on the metalled road for about 4 Km, a turn
along the left bank will lead to the work site at the end of a modified left guide bank. To reach
the work site on the right bank, the metalled road over the barrage shall lead to the turning point
on the right bank and then onto the work site on the right bank via the modified right guide
bank. These approaches are not likely to cause any significant environmental and social
problems for the construction programme.
3.10 ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT
Estimate capital cost emprises the of the basic cost, escalation (price contingencies) at 4%
on local and 2% on foreign cost components per annum, and the interest during construction
at the rates of 14% and 3% for local and foreign cost component respectively. Basic cost
includes provisions for the estimated expenditures concerning the following main
components: -
I. Sub weir located 1500 feet downstream of existing barrage.
II. Silt excludes in the right pocket.
Ill. Strengthening of downstream floor and glacis of the existing stilling basin.
IV. Improvement on the existing river training walls and related model studies
Estimate capital cost of the project cross to Rs. 8232.22 million, which is composed of base
cost (Rs. 6154.80 million), physical contingencies (Rs. 184.64 million), price esealation (Rs.
434.72 million), taxes and duties (Rs. 504.84 million), interest during construction (Rs.
1253.22 million). Adequate provision has been made for certain market ancillary work such
as dewatering, model studies, vehicles and equipment, strengthening of existing barrage.
Taking the above quoted Feasibility figures as the closest estimate, the approximate cost of
the project can taken as Rs. 82,00.00 million. Cost weir this is a mega project for which a
comprehensive ESIA is estimate hence this study.

3.11 THE PROJECT CATEGORY AS PER APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND CRITERIA
According to the World Bank Operational Manual OP 4.01 the Projects are Classified, for the
purpose of screening into one of the four categories; A, B, C and Fl, depending upon the type,
location, sensitivity and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential
environmental impacts.  The proposed project aims at improving and modernizing the
operational capability of Taunsa Barrage so its impacts shall be essentially local though
irreversible. As per screening done according to the World Bank specification and as per criteria
of the Government of the Punjab (Pakistan), the Taunsa Barrage Project as a part of the
Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation and Modernization Project qualifies to be classified as Category
"B" Project.
3.12 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Main objectives of Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation Project are as follows:
*  To save the existing barrage structure and to run it at full design capacity, by
construction of a sill downstream.
*  To improve and modernize the operational capability of the barrage.
*  To ensure enhanced availability of canal water by running them at full capacity, leading
to enhancement in food and fiber crops.
*  To cause improvement in System Management.
*  Mitigate adverse environmental impacts of the new interventions.
By above quantities there shall be material interventions on the Project Site.
3.13 CONCLUSION
The proposed design fully secures the rehabilitation of old barrage. At the cost of only
rehabilitation, the advantages of a new barrage have been achieved. The physical life of the
old barrage, after rehabilitation and modernization shall be extended by another 50 years.
The design discharge is calculated at 1,000,000 (10 lac) cusecs to ensure that maximum
anticipated flood can pass which so far has not crossed 8 lac cusecs.
The highest pond level has been experienced twice over past 10 years and that was RL 448.
At that level there has been no damage or upsetness in the wildlife sanctuary or ecosystem

of the river upstream or downstream. The new design envisages to keep the pond level at
RL 446 by running the canals at their present capacity. At that level, the shoreline of the
pond will not change and no change will take place in the land water ratio in the habitate of
the wildlife sanctuary or the RAMSAR site. The pond level being at RL 446 during summer
as well as winter, the canals shall receive full design capacity during summer and drinking
water supply during winter. There is neither any increase in the crest level nor in the head
across or the upstream water level. The stated pupose of rehabilitation, to ensure the safety
of structure and not storage of more water shall be achieved.

4.1 PROJECT AREA OF IMPACT (Aoi)
The area of project influence is referred to as "Area of Impact" (AOl); the area within the river
and in the immediate vicinity which will be impacted directly or indirectly by the project during
construction and operational phases. Although the major construction activities shall remain
restricted to the river corridor, yet the situation in which construction related activities will extend
beyond the river waters include:-
*  The labour camp site, project and contractor's camps, equipment and machinery yards and
material depots.
*  Borrowing sites for soil materials.
*  Quarrying aggregate materials.
*  Construction of haul tracks in order to transport construction material.
Aoi has been delineated on the Project Area Map at Figure 1-1.
As per geographical positioning, Taunsa Barrage is located on Indus River at 300 31 N and 700
51 E in the south-western part of Punjab in Tehsil Kot Addu of District Muzaffargarh. The
canals off-taking from this barrage irrigate three Districts namely; Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur
and Muzaffargarh, besides transferring water through Taunsa Panjnad Link for Rahim Yar
Khan District. Population of all these Districts is over 12 million with an area of 17,500 sq. miles
(44,800 sq. Kms). An arterial road linking eastern and western parts of the province also
crosses over the barrage besides a rail link for Quetta and Karachi and a natural gas pipeline
supplying gas to KAPCO and southern Punjab alongwith Kot Addu Thermal Power Station a
16 dia PARCO pipe line conveying pumped petroleum products from Karachi terminal to mid-
country storages at Mehmood Kot Terminal.
4.2 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.2.1 Geology
The project area consists of alluvial plains, fine to course grained soil and dominated with
deposits having calcareous nature. The part of the area lying on the western end comprises
piedmont plains of expanding type of clay, which form deep and wide cracks on drying.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
4.2.2 Physiography
The project area consists of the Indus River upstream and downstream Taunsa Barrage. The
area in the vicinity is situated in the active flood plains on either side of the Indus River. A part
of the area falling on the right bank is situated on the piedmont plains extending from Sulaiman
Range. The piedmont plains are dominated by alluvial fans developed along he torrents flowing
eastward down the mountains. On the contrary, the northern part of the left bank is mostly
covered with rolling sand plains/dunes and interdunal depressions. Considerable part of sandy
area is currently under cultivation.
4.2.3 Soil Type
The river bed and the flood plain soils are calcarious and contains variable amount of lime (3 to
16%). The electrical conductivity of saturation extract (ECE) of normal soils ranges from 0.4 to
3.9 ms/cm and for saline soils from 4.1 to 220 ms/cm. The pH of normal soils ranges from 7.9
to 8.4 and that of saline/sodic soils can be as high as 9.1. The soils are deficient in available
phosphorus and organic matter.
The soils of piedmont plains are clayey of an expending type, which form deep and wide cracks
on drying. All piedmont soils are moderately to strongly calcarious. The EC of normal soils
ranges from 0.9 to 3.4 ms/cm and for saline soils 4.6 to 300 ms/cm. The pH of normal soils
ranges from 7.4 to 8.1 and for saline soils 7.2 to 8.0.
4.2.4 Land Use
On an average, within the direct influence of the river and in the immediate vicinity of the project
area, 70% of the area is under agriculture, 10% under orchards and 20% is open forest scrub
cum grazing lands, as shown in Figure 4-1A.

detailed below: -
Figure 4.2  The Hydrograph chows the U/S water level for the year 1999. Maximum level
(447) is seen in May to October period. June to August is the period
experiencing maximum flood level at RL 447, while and December and
January are the months with the lowest water level at RL 429-430.
Figure 4.3  The Hydrograph shows the U/S water levels for the year 2000. Maximum level
(447.7) is seen in July and August. The hydrograph almost floolows the picture
of the previous year 1999 i.e. June to August is the period with highest flood
level, while December and Juanyar are the months with lowest flood level.
Figure 4.4  The Hydrograph shows the U/S water levels for the year 2001. Maximum level
(447.7 - 447.6) s seen in June to September period. It is a year with higher
temperature range and higher rainfall. The high flood started from May and
continued upto September.
Figure 4.5  The Hydrograph shows the U/S water levels for the year 2002. Maximum level
(448) is seen in July and August. Year 2002 has followed the pattern of 2001.

4.2.6 Water Resource for the Vicinity Area
* Surface Water
Main surface water for the fishermen hamlets and nearby villages is the Indus River itself which
has an average discharge of 500,000 cusecs. Taunsa Barrage was basically designed to
handle waters upto 1,000,000 cusecs. So, the quantity of water flowing through the gates of
weir has never caused any problem regarding discharge. But some other problems are
retrogression, oblique river approach to the barrage and deficient thickness of downstream floor
and damage to glacis. (See plate 4.1)
Major use of the surface water is irrigation. The irrigated area is served by three canal
commands namely Rajanpur, Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan Canal. All three systems are
non-perennial having full supply factor at outlet heads as 4.87, 8.57 and 6.36 cusecs per 1000
acres of C.C.A. Generally, furrow and basin irrigation is practised in the area by gravity flow
supplemented with public and private tubewells in fresh ground water zone except on the right
side of Dera Ghazi Khan Canal where small size lift pumps have been installed by irrigators to
feed their high elevation lands along right bank of the canal.
A network of surface drainage system is functioning in both canal commands (Muzaffargarh
and Dera Ghazi Khan) having a length of 350 miles (896 Kms), besides vertical drainage
through public and private tubewells in saline zone and along T-P Link Canal.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
* Ground Water
Aquifer of the area adjacent to the project site is generally sweet and good for drinking as well
as irrigation purpose. Part of the area falling in Tehsils Rajanpur and Rojhan of District
Rajanpur under the command of Dera Ghazi Khan Canal is brackish and canal water is the
only source for drinking and irrigation in such areas. In Muzaffargarh District, command area of
Thal Branch of Muzaffargarh Canal also lies in brackish ground water.
4.2.7 Climate
The climate of the Project area can be characterized by extremely hot summer and scarce rain.
The evapotranspiration of the area being more than 50% of the precipitation the area falls in
arid zone. Following are some specific components of the climate:
* Temperature
Summer temperatures range between 460C and 270C while the winter temperature range
remains between 19°C and 5°C.
* Rainfall
Average annual rainfall is about 200 mm, 80% of which is in summer.
* Relative Humiditv
The area is arid so the relative humidity is never more than 50%. On the other hand the
evapotranspiration of the area is always more than 50%.
* Wind Velocity
Prevalent wind velocity is 15-30 Kmph. At times, during summers, it can get to 30-35 Kmph
creating dust storms and making air hazy and dusty.

4.2.8 Ambient Quality of Environment
* Ambient Air Quality
The ambient air is sufficiently clean at present. Keeping in view the traffic levels, present and
expected, no significant change is anticipated in the air quality even after the completion of the
project. Table 4.3 shows the traffic count for one week and the average daily traffic of 656
vehicles is too small to be significant from air quality point of view. Air standards for Pakistan
have not yet been standardized but upto 5,000 vehicles per day are considered below the
critical level. However, the vibration effect of Trains within a short span of time is a matter of
concern. An innovative use of the traffic has been discovered by some industrious people.
Local people make use of typha leaves to make mats (locally called suff). Typha leaves are
places on the road for the traffic to pass over it and the leaves become soft and flex able for the
work. (See plate 4.14)

Taunsa consist of all types of vehicles; of then a tractor trolley and bus are visible in this picture.
* Noise Level
At present the traffic level is very low and noise is not a problem. No significant change is
anticipated even after the completion of the project. Major noise comes from 656 vehicles per
day (refer Table 4.4) can be calculated as follows:

Per minute average noise emission is 35 decibels which is much below the permissible critical
level. But a concentrated high level noise even for a short time can make a significant
difference.
4.2.9 Natural Event History
* Seismicity
The project area is located over Indian Tectonic Plate, towards the centre of the plate, where
occasional jolts of Richter Scale 4-5 can be experienced. The project area has been placed in
Zone 1 on the "Seismic Zoning Map" of Pakistan by the Geological Survey of Pakistan.
Occasional jolts of this intensity are not likely to cause any significant impact on the new project
structure or vice versa.
* Floods
The Taunsa Barrage is located on the River Indus where according to the prevailing distribution
of water, the downstream discharge rarely exceed, 0.7 million cusecs (see Table 4.2). The
barrage has been designed for 1.0 million cusecs. That implies that even if the flood discharge

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
rises to 1.0 million cusecs, it can have no threat to the construction or operation of the new
gateless weir.
0 Archaeological Sites/Chance Find
There no reports or claims regarding the existence of any archaeological find near or on the
project site. There is neither a graveyard in the vicinity nor any worship place. In case there is a
chance find, it can be handled as per Law and Procedures already in vogue in Punjab.
4.3 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.3.1 Flora
The flora can be divided into two parts:-
(i)   Riverian Track
(ii)  Inland Area
On fresh silt alluvium of riverian tract, especially in pond area. In succession of vegetation,
first colonizers are grasses and Typha followed by Tamarix riverbed serut as the soil
becomes consolidated and is raised by new silt deposition in the scrub, so that the
vegetation is no longer completely submerged and erect tree growth becomes possible.
As long as the edaphic conditions remain unstable, Tamarix and Poplar remain dominant. As
the soil gets stabilized and drained the forest community normally progresses to Acacia
nilotica and prosopis spicigera. In its present state, the flora of Riverian Alluvial deposits can
be listed as follows:-
Trees
Lai (Tamarix dioca)
Pilchi (Tamarix gallica)
Babool (Acacia nilotica)
Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo)
Beri (Zizyphus yujuba)
Jand (Prosophis spicigera)
Raesquette (Prosophs juliflora)
Raesquette (Prosopis glandulosa)
Bhen/Poplar (Populus enphratica)

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Other Plants
Khabbal (Cynodon dactylon)
Kanwal (Melolotus oralifolia)
Munj (Erianthus munja)
Kai (Sacchrum spontaneum)
Kunder (Typha elephantina)
Whereas the trees provide a habitat for birds, the solid ground below houses the mammals.
The margin line of Typha and grasses becomes a good habitat for reptiles while the fish
occupy the adjacent waters.
Inland Area
Inland area is either on the river banks or on rised parts of the consolidated alluvial deposits
within the pond. The natural flora of inland area is as follows:-
Trees
Jand (Prosopis spicigera)
Karir (Capparis aphylla)
Van (Salvadora oleoides)
Peeloo (Salvadora persica)
Kikar (Acacia nilotica)
Lana (Suda ruiteesa)
Lani (Salsola fostida)
Beri (Zizyphus jujube)
Other Plants
Harmal (Paganum harmala)
Khardar (Alhaji camelorum)
Khabbal (Cynodon dactylona)
Datura (Datura alba)
Phog (Calligonum polygnoides)
Pohli (Argemone maxicana)
Malla (Zizphus numularia)
Date Palm (Phoenix rubicola)

Exotics introduced in inland area
Near the banks some exotic tree species have been introduced over the time. Some of these
are:-
Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo)
Mulberry (Morus alba)
Bakain (Melia azadarach)
Shirin/Siris (Albizzia lebeck)
Sufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis)
Ipal Ipal (Lucaena minosifolia)

* Fishes
One hundred and twenty seven species of fresh water fish have been recognized in Indus
River in its plain journey, comprising 59 cyprinids, 33 slurries, 2 clupeids and 33 others. Of
these most important are Palla (Tenua losa ilisha) which is an anadromous species and
Mahasheer (Torputitora spp.) which is a powerful game fish. But due to construction of a
series of barrages Palla cannot migrate from sea upwards and is almost extinct from Indus
waters. Upward breeding movement of Mahasheer is also restricted due to barrages. A
comprehensive list of fishes of River Indus upstream and downstream Taunsa Barrage is
given at Annex-Ill.
> The Extinct Palla
Under ordinary circumstances, the reproductive urge instinctively diverts palla fish from the
sea to swim up the river for hundreds of miles. The run of fish has been blocked with
construction of every new barrage. Being a sub-surface swimmer, it does not struggle to
cross fish ladders. Therefore, its movement has been extremely restricted. It has reduced
the food for river predators which have become extinct. It has also adversely affected the
fishermen communities all along the river.
The above reported flora, fauna including fish are present in the wildlife sanctuary upstream
the old Taunsa barrage. All the three components of biota represent some of the rarre
natural beauty which can be joy for ever for ecotourists, photographers and serious students
of riverian ecology (see plates 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11).

(Platanista minor) was included in the IUCN Red Rook of endangered species in 1976, and it still has the
same status there.

4.3.3 Wildlife Sanctuary
Taunsa Barrage wildlife sanctuary has an area of 6567 hectares and it extends upto almost 6
miles (10 Kin) above the barrage. Declared as a sanctuary by wildlife Department Punjab in
1974, it came to be recognized as RAMSAR world class protected area in 1996 (see plates 4.7
to 4.13), especially with respect to the waterfowl species. The following species of waterfowl
nest and breed in the sanctuary.
Lesser Whistling teal (Dendrocynge javanice)
Red wattled lapwing (Vanwllus indicus)
Pheasant tailed Jacane (Hydrophasianus chirurgus)
Purple gallinule (Porphario porphario)
Egrets (Egretta spp)
Cranes (Grus grus and Authropides Virgo)
For the common demoiselle cranes, the sanctuary is a staging area, while grebes, ducks,
Shore birds bar headed geese, geese, coots, ibises, storks and waders come to the sanctuary
for over wintering. Thus Taunsa wildlife is a important safe haven for the migratory population of
birds along Indus Flyway route. Sometimes very rare birds such as the Bewick's swan (Cynus

cobumbianus bewickii) and black necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) visit the lake. The
swamps around the pond, on either bank and on the belas formed inside the pond area within
the river, are abode of variety of ibises, egrets, herons and waders. The Pelicans (Pelecanus)
congregate on the belas inside the ponds. Flamingos (Phoenicopterus spp.) can usually be
seen standing in rows in knee deep water, while waiting for the prey to appear near the surface
of water.
The following local species of birds also live and thrive well in the wildlife sanctuary: -
Black Partridge (Alectoris relanochipala)
Grey partridge (Alectoris phibji)
Quail (Pluvialis spp.)
Blue Bird (Pyeronotus xynthopygos)
Jungle Pigeon (Teron walia)
Sun Bird (Nectarine spp)
Doves (Streptophelia roseogrisera)
Warbler (Philoseopus umbrovirens)
House Sparrow (Passer spp)
Russian Sparrow (Hirundo rustica)
Crow (Corcias abyssinicus russian)
Owl (Bubo africans)
The Taunsa Barrage is a worldwide recognized habitat of Indus blind Dolphin (Platanista
minor). Other mammals include Hog Deer (Axis porcinis), Jackal (Canes Auras), Hare (Lupus
Capensis), Porcupine (Hysterics indica) and Wild boar (Sus scrofa).
The present state of wildlife sanctuary depends upon Taunsa Barrage pond around a level of
RL 446.
4.3.4 Indus Dolphin
In the province of Punjab, the occurrence of the Indus Dolphin (Platanista minor)) is
restricted to 500 km between Chashma and Guddu Barrage and Taunsa Barrage has almost
bissected the Dolphin habit. The population of Dolphin has been split up in the upstream
area and downstream area of the barrage. Those who had the opportunity to see the Indus
Dolphin's habitat and have done research work on the species, need not be reminded how

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
extremely difficult it is to carry out even observational research on the species. However,
following statistics has been available from the Wildlife Department of Punjab.
After the wildlife Department enforced strict protection measures, a gradual increase in the
Dolphin population was noticed till 1992 (see table 4.5). Comparatively higher rate of
increase in Chashma-Taunsa reach is attributable to the protection due to wildlife sanctuary.
An almost levelling of the Indus dolphin population in Taunsa suggests two possibilities.
First, that the population of the specis as a predator might have reached a saturation point
for the area. Second that the condition favourable to Dolphin breeding cannot be improved
any further. However, it may be too early to decide in the absence of data on the extent of
habitat, general habitat conditions, biological relationship and productivity. The actual fact if
that the Indus Dolphin is a unique species. Even though its number has increased, it still is
considered endangered. The knowledge gathered about it though significant, remains rather
rudimentary. It is still a challenge for the scientific community to peruse research on the
Dolphin. The IUCN included this species in their Red Book of endangered species in 1976
and it still is there.
The WWF, however, does not fully endorse the Dolphin statistics released by the Wildlife
Departmetn as reproduced in table 4.5. Their Dolphin distribution map of Indus shows that
the number of Dolphin increase as the river approaches the southern proximities refere
Figure 4.10, as can be seen in the table 4.6 below.

The WWF experts opine that the Dolphins are flushed downwards with each flood while it
cannot move upwards because of barrage. This hybothesis however requires further
investigation.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Some of the researched aspects are about sleeping and mating of Dolphin. In order to adapt
to the environment of the river, Indus Dolphin has developed the shortest sleep phases ever
observed in the mammals. Its sleeping behavior has been scientifically desired as polyhasic.
At the Berne institute of Brain Anatomy, the study of sleeping behavior with the help of
oscilloscope revealed numerous interruption in transmission, after lasting less than a second
and never longer than eight seconds. After weeks of observations and adding up the
seconds and transmission breaks during each twenty four hours period, the average comes
to about seven to eight hours, which is equivalent to normal sleeping period of mammals.
Mating takes place in April/May and ten months later in February/March the female gives
birth to a single calf measuring from 70 to 75 cm long. The offspring are suckled until
December, by which time they have grown to 1 meter in length. Average age of Dolphin is
20 years and river Dolphins are not capable of reproduction before eight years by which time
their body length is fully developed and is abut 2 meters long with a body weight of about 75
kg. The females are somewhat larger than the males and have a longer beak than that of
males. The males are more lively than female and adapt to a new environment quicker than
the females.
The Indus Dolphin is always blind. Its eyes are fully developed but regressed. Visibility in the
murky water of Indus is not more than 2-4 cm. The Dolphin's eye has fallen victim to the
opaque environment over the past millions of years and has led to a complete loss of the
ability to differentiate objects by sight. Instead it was its well developed sonar or echo-
location system with which the animal is not only capable of identifying minute objects but it
can detect difference between live and dead fish.
In nature the Dolphin plays the role of a predator as well as a scavenger. It eats sick, weak
and dead fish and keeps the river clean. In its cyclic movement it can travel upto 10 km per
day but it keep its habitat restricted within 5-8 kms. Its will however migrate to the distances
more than 50km for food and sex reasons.
4.3.5 Agriculture
The project area is famous for cotton in Kharif season. Wheat is the major Rabi crop. Rice rank
next to wheat in cereals, sugarcane cultivation is popular in Tehsil Kot Adu because of the
vicinity to sugar mill. High quality mango orchards have been raised in Rajanpur and
Muzaffargarh. However in the immediate project area in its vicinity or near the wildlife sanctuary

no such agricultural activity is noticeable the abandoning of which may cause any siginificant

4.4 SOCIO ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL ASPECTS
4.4.1 Population and community structure
The Taunsa Barrage canal system is presently conveying 6 million acre feet of water within
32,489 km2 area and serves a population of 11 million people of whom 48% are women. The
rate of population growth amongst the poor classes is at least 5% which is one of the highest in
Punjab. A representative comparison of population growth vs resources was seen near old
workshop, (see plate 4.14).
4.4.2 Poverty Status
About 38% of the population in the immediate project area lives under food and basic needs
poverty line and their income is less than RS 2000 per month per family.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
4.4.3 Services and Facilitates in the Area
* Water source used
42% of the communities do not have access to clean drinking water and consequently have
water oriented health and poverty problems of these 42% more than 50% are not aware of the
consequences of drinking unclean water. Some claim that running river water is healthier that a
hand pump water major sources of water are river, canals and hand pumps.
* Education Level
52% of the total respondents in the area are illiterate while 48% are primary and above.
* Transportation and Accessibility
Almost all the community in the area adjacent to the Taunsa Barrage have access and
transportation facility because the road and railway links are available. A small villages road
connects them to the main road where ample Wagon and Bus service is available for all
destinations. But Taunsa Barrage bridge plays cardinal role in this facility.
* Electricity Source Used
About 80% of the inhabitants in the immediate and extended project area have access to
electricity. Because of high cost, most house holds restrict themselves to use of few bulb and
fans. The fishermen communities still use kerosene oil in hurricane lanterns for light at night.
*  Health Facilities
There is an overcrowded Tehsil Headquarter Government Hospital at Kot Adu. Above 50% of
the population are prone to Malaria and various epidemics. Polio plus program has made its
presence felt every where.
* Employment
Employment opportunities for local populations shall increase by almost 100% during the
construction phase and by 50% during operational phase. During construction, the contractor
shall be urged to prefer the employment of local labour especially in unskilled category. Typha
mat (suff) cottage industry is giving bread to about 5% of the population. Typha leaves are cut
from marshy lands bundled and put on metalled road for the vehicles to pass over and soften
then, making fit for mat making (See plate 4.15).

* HIV / AIDS Risk
The labour camp, their interaction with truck drivers and alike personnel are potential places for
spread of HIV/AIDS if the incidence exists. Almost 100% of the people of project area and the
potential labour are not aware of the source, mode of communication or consequences of
HIV/AIDS. Although their religious and cultural value system, to a large extent excludes the out
break or rapid communication of HIV/AIDS, yet its occurrence in such a situation cannot be
precluded. It is necessary that alongwith other communicable diseases like Cholera, Typhoid
and Tuberculosis, awareness and preventive campaigns are run from time to time in the labour
camps and the field offices of the project on HIV/AIDS also.
* Recreation Facilities
More than 12000 local tourists visit Taunsa Barrage annually to enjoy the picturesque scenery
created by the pond effect behind the barrage. Some of them also enjoy boat ride upstream as
well as downstream. A boat with "Mallah" is arranged by a private social organization. On a
good day, a boatman can make Rs. 1 00/= to 200/= by charging Rs. 5/= per person per trip.
4.4.4 Conclusions
On the basis of the baseline survey, some of the obvious conclusions are as follows:
* There will be no serious environmental or social problem in the project area because of the
project intervention because all construction activities will take place downstream of the
existing barrage outside the wildlife sanctuary and the RAMSAR site.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
*  No negative impact can be anticipated on the farmers or other parts of the local
communities, as all construction and allied activities will take place on I&P Department land.
*  Water distribution efficiency, flood control downstream fishing and social mobility by boats
will increase, when the barrage is rehabilitated and modernized (plate 4.16).
* The pond level upstream will remain at 446 (as before), and fauna of the Wildlife Sanctuary.
*  With ensured safety of the Taunsa Barrage, the people living near the barrage or
downstream will enjoy a greater sense of security.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
5. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
The Project options considered were:-
1. No project option / worst scenario option.
2. In place of old Taunsa Barrage structures, a new barrage is constructed on the same
site.
3. A new Taunsa Barrage is built at a new site and the existing barrage is abandoned
and destroyed.
4. A gateless weir is built at an alternate site and not exactly at a distance of 1500ft.
downstream.
5. The cross sections and height (dimensions) of the proposed gateless weir is
changed.
6. The Taunsa Barrage is denotified as wildlife sanctuary and as a RAMSAR site.
7. Instead of using existing link roads, paths, camping sites, dumping ground and
machinery yards, alternate sites are chosen.
8. The Project is accepted as per given and objectives defined in the proposal.
Each alternative was subjected to analysis as per its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats (SWOT); as follows: -
5.1 NO PROJECT OPTION / WORST SCENARIO OPTION
(a) Analysis
* Strength and opportunities
If the Project is not taken up at all, then all the efforts and investments shall be saved and
these could be diverted elsewhere. Should the barrage collapse, the Palla and Mahasher
fish and Indus Dolphin could move into about 250 km of additional spawning habitat
upstream of the barrage.
Furthermore, high maintenance cost and cumbersome operation would be avoided.
Ecologist believes that taking down a barrage will return a river to an ecologically healthy
state. The remarkably limited scientific evidence available regarding Indus river, however,
does not entirely support that belief. Nevertheless, removal of a barrage releases the water
that has collected behind it in the pond, With water it also releases sediments that decades

of slowed water had dropped as it approaches the barrage. The sediment can replenish
riverbanks downstream, thereby improving the river nutrients especially Phosphorus and
Nitrogen and thus reduce or eliminate eutrophication in the ex-pond area. Instead, the fish
population would revert to normal.
* Weaknesses and threats
Not taking up the Project will result in collapse of he old barrage, which will lead to
catastrophic destruction of the entire Taunsa barrage irrigation complex. Unprecedented
floods shall be followed by canal closure and destruction of agriculture by cutting off 6 million
acre feet of crucial irrigation water from six districts of southern Punjab. The pond will be
destroyed and the wildlife sanctuary, which is also a RAMSAR site shall vanish, forever and
a safe heaven for resting and breeding of waterfowl and mating area of Indus Dolphin shall
cease of exist. The barrages, downstream Taunsa i.e. Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri as well as
the under construction barrage at Sehwan will be washed away by the huge flood released
by the destroyed Taunsa barrage without a warning. A large number of villages along the left
and right bank of the river will be washed way resulting in heavy death toll of humans and
cattle. The women and the children will would be worst affected. A large part of nearby
population shall be turned homeless. All services including electricity education and
communication shall be disrupted. Rail link to Karachi and Quetta will be cut off. Arterial road
connecting Punjab and Balochistan will be destroyed and supply of natural Gas to southern
Punjab and supply of Petroleum to Balochistan shall be cut off. Trade and social life
dependent upon Taunsa bridge linkage will be destroyed. The Toll Station will also not exist.
Many such site-specific factors, which cannot be anticipated at this stage, will influence the
ecologist changes that accrue when a barrage actually gets removed. A dooms day in the
area shall be unleashed.
(b) Conclusion
For this proposal, the weaknesses outweigh the strengths and the threats overly are more
than opportunities. No project option possessing the potential of worst scenario is therefore
not recommended.

5.2 OPTION OF NEW BARRAGE ON THE SAME SITE
(a) Analysis
* Strength and opportunities
If the old barrage is replaces with an altogether a new barrage, a weakness free new
barrage will come up with a new lease of physical life of at least 50 years. The new barrage
can be appropriately designed and desired modification and modernization can be
incorporated. The cumbersome process of manually operating the weir gates can be
replaced with electronic control. The existing hydraulic defect e.g. retrogression, oblique river
approach to the barrage and deficient thickness of downstream floor can be ruled out
through a superior design. Also the skin and the baffle blocks could be built with concrete of
the same strength. Above all, the capacity of existing Taunsa Barrage and the bridge over
the weir could be enhanced with improved road, rail, gas and petrol pipelines.
* Weaknesses and threats
Construction of an altogether new barrage will involve huge and unaffordable financial
resources, which are not readily available at, present. The existing services e.g. irrigation,
wildlife sanctuary, fisheries, use of road and railway bridge, Sui Gas and petrol supplies etc.
shall be suspended during the construction period, which will be 4 - 5 years. Dolphin habitat
will be further disturbed and their population, brought to the present level over past twelve
years, will once again decline. The existing physical, biological and socio - economic
balance of upstream and downstream shall have to be destroyed at least temporarily
causing RAMSAR site upsetness and thus a major objections from RAMSAR, Wildlife
Department and the EPA. The Canal system shall have to be stopped for some time causing
colossal short and long-term economic losses by cutting of drinking and irrigation water. And
the physical conditions being the same it is possible that new design may not be able to
exclude the old defects altogether.
(b) Conclusion: Under the prevailing circumstances, the option of constructing new barrage
is not recommendable in view of non-availability of financial resources and threat to the
ecosystem and irrigation system. However this has the potential of being the second best
option provided that financial resources become readily available and all potential negative
impacts are adequately mitigated through good design, controlled construction, protected
flora and founa, saved wildlife sanctuary and workable SFA with local communities.

5.3 OPTION OF NEW BARRAGE ON NEW SITE
(a)   Analysis
* Strengths and opportunities
A new weakness free new site will become available where the inherent defects due to site
will not emerge. All weaknesses due to design deficiency will be removed. Subject to its
feasibility on new site, the new barrage will be modified built and operated according to most
modern technology available to Pakistan. Especially the existing hydraulic defects e.g.
retrogression, oblique river approach to barrage and deficiencies in downstream floor can be
ruled out through a superior design. The concrete for the surface and inside of baffle blocks
can be kept uniform. And the capacity of existing Taunsa bridge can be increased for road,
rail, gas pipe line and petrol pipe line.
* Weaknesses and threats
Selection of new site upstream and downstream is externally difficult as the width of river
and its tendency to run in multi-channels increases on either side. There is no denying the
fat that new barrage will involve huge and unaffordable financial resources and the
prohibitive financial cost will dater new construction. Also existing barrage and pond
ecosystem will be completely destroyed. The agreement in RAMSAR convention shall be
changed as the existing canal system, wildlife sanctuary and fisheries safe haven will be
heavily disturbed and Dolphin habitat will be subject to an adverse change possibly leading
once again to decline in its population. The canal system shall have to be stopped and
redone at least for constructing new linkages to old canals. The intervening period shall be
dry and hostile. Furthermore, the physical conditions being the same, it is possible that new
design may not be able to exclude the defects noticed in the old barrage model.
(b) Conclusion: Option of new design on new site is not acceptable because of the threats,
which outnumber the opportunities.

5.4 THE OPTION OF HAVING NEW WEIR AT LESSER THAN 1500 FT DOWNSTREAM
Analysis
* Strength and opportunities
By a new simulated model a better distance can be worked out at Irrigation Research
Nandipur Institute. And by change of distance a better hydrological advantage may be
achieved. Lesser distance and smaller structures would cut the cost. Above all, there shall
be lesser ecological disturbance downstream.
* Weaknesses and threats
It is also possible that a changed distance is not optimal and may induce more defects. It is
understood that change of site is not being considered for upstream because any site
upstream is technically inappropriate because of wider span of the river. For any new site,
new design and new cost estimates and drawings shall have to be prepared. The new
design may turn out to be defective and hydrologically inefficient. By bringing the gateless
weir too close to the old weir the problem of hydraulic jump (the energy dissipating
turbulence) is not fully addressed. And if the defects persist, it may not only cause heavy
financial losses in terms of the construction undertaken, but also it will have the potential to
cause catastrophic destruction of the whole barrage and the barrages, below Taunsa.
(b) Conclusion: Construction of the new weir at 1500 ft or closer shall fully defend upon the
success of the site in simulation model. Any site between 800-1500 ft, subject to its success
in simulation model, will be feasible.
5.5 OPTION OF NOT CHANGING THE DIMENSIONS OF THE GATELESS WEIR
(a)   Analysis
* Strength and opportunities
The existing model of gateless, 4346 ft across the Indus River, weir, impervious 238 ft. crest
level 424 ft. has been hydraulically efficient model simulated at Nandipur irrigation Research
institute. The weir provides efficient energy dissipation for turbulence created downstream.
The model provides protection against local scouring by providing stone aprons upstream

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
and downstream. By all standards, the model satisfies the standard hydraulic requirements
and criteria. By doing so, main Taunsa barrage is saved and is given an extended physical
life for at least 50 years and the defects developed therein e g. retrogression, oblique river
approach and deficiencies in the downstream floor will be eliminated. And the rehabilitation
and modernization of main barrage gives 50 more years of efficient irrigation and agriculture
production in six districts of southern Punjab through an existing system of canals.
* Weaknesses and threats
Efficiency of the weir will ultimately depend upon the geotech characteristics of the rock and
soil below the foundation of the gateless weir. As the geotech properties of the soil shall
continue to be the same, piping and cavities below the weir is possible, especially when the
provided safety measures are minimal. Should the sub-weir develop a fault, threats to the
main barrage can revive, and in an aggravated manner.
(b) Conclusion: Considering all pro cons, the design of sub-weir (gateless weir) as per
length across river 4346'. Impervious floor 238 ft and crest level 424 ft is a safe option. Its
location can be between 800 ft-1 500 ft downstream of the existing barrage.
5.6 OPTION OF DENOTIFYING TAUNSA BARRAGE POND AREA AS WILDLIFE
SANCTUARY AND AS RAMSAR SITE
(b)   Analysis
* Strength and opportunities
By denotifying the area as the wildlife sanctuary and as a RAMSAR site, the biological
interference in the engineering priorities shall be eliminated River training works such as
construction of new spurs, dredging of the "belas" to correct the oblique strike of the main
river channel and raising the level of pond to optimal levels will become possible without any
concern from NCCW, EPA, wildlife Department or RAMSAR secretariat. The freedom of
design and operation, will bring down the construction and operational cost. Also it can open
opportunities for declaring the area as game reserve and invite visitors and tourists to enjoy
hunting, within permissible limits. Tourist, resorts can be constructed on the stable islands
within the pond area. Fishing industry will flourish and the local communities will be able to
manage the river flora and fauna to their benefit in accordance with their age old traditions.
State revenue from natural resources will increase.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
* Weaknesses and threats
A well-established river based ecosystem will be destroyed. The water fowl and Indus
Dolphin will once again become threatened species and all their food chains will be
destroyed. Well established riverain habitat made by Typha, sedge, Munj, Kai, Pilchi, Frash,
Bhan succession will be annihilated. Control over 6 miles upstream river by way of protection
through application of Wildlife Act 1974 shall cease to exist and indiscriminate shooting and
poaching of wildlife and exploitation of riverain forests will start. Encroachments by seasonal
agriculturalists will become rampant on Kacha areas and increased incidence of erosion will
enhance the rate of siltation, which will lead to reduced capacity of pond as well as the
canals. The umbrella of NCCW, EPA and RAMSAR shall be lifted and the prestige earned
by Pakistan at international level as RAMSAR member country shall be lost. Apparent higher
degree of freedom will damage the barrage as well as the local communities physically,
biologically and socially.
(b) Conclusion: The option of the denotifying Taunsa Barrage as wildlife sanctuary and as
RAMSAR site in not recommendable because of globally significant physical, biological and
social reasons and on account of our international obligations.
5.7 OPTION OF ALTERNATE LOGISTICS
(a)   Analysis
* Strength and opportunities
Old workshop, link road, the metalled road and roads on top of the downstream bund, are
available at no additional cost. In this arrangement there are minimum security risks. For
using these facilities, no compensation, resettlement or rehabilitation is involved. Labour
camp, material dump, machinery yard and project field offices being located in the same
general area, would make command and control of works earies and more effective (See
Project Area Map Figure 3.1).
It is an opportunity to put the l&P Dept building and lands, lying unused so far, to use for a
good Project. The proposed campsite can be developed as the operational headquarter of
rehabilitated Taunsa Barrage. The available campsite is so close to the worksite that mixing
of material can be done at the campsite and it can be transported to the work base from
where it can be conveyed to actual construction point through a conveyor belt or suction
hose.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
* Weaknesses and threats
The Kacha link road from campsite to the metalled road and roads on top of the downstream
guide bund will need surfacing and maintenance to make the traffic dust and noise free. The
old buildings will require heavy repairs before these are occupied for use. The dumping of
material and spill of oil etc. on the I&P land will require rehabilitation after the completion of
the project. The contractor shall have to bring the site to the same condition, in which it is
occupied.
However, during the period of construction of the sub-weir, it will not be possible for the i&P
Department to put the old workshop site or 46 acres of land to any alternate use. Further,
excessive and heavy traffic on Kacha roads may destroy the road and for adapting alternate
logistics, it will be necessary to go out of the l&P Department land and for that charges shall
have to be paid in addition to providing resettlement/rehabilitation.
(b) Conclusion: The proposed site for labour camp, material depot, Vehicle and machinery
yard and use of link road, main metalled road and downstream guide bunds are safest and
zero cost opportunity, which is recommended.
5.8 OPTION OF PROPOSED DESIGN
The proposed design fully secures the rehabilitation of the old barrage (See detailed
discussion in para 4.13). Under the given circumstances the proposed designed of sub-weir
4346 ft. long with crest level of RL 424 and sites between 800 -1500 downstream keeping
the pond level at RL 446 is the best option and have been adopted.
5.9 SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES
1.    No project option/worst scenario option is not recommended.
2.    A new barrage cannot be built under present non availability of financial resources.
3.    A new barrage at a new site will be even more expensive and is not recommended.
4.    Building a gateless weir is recommended at 800 -1500 downstream.
5.    The proposed cross section and crest level is quite appropriate.
6.    Taunsa Barrage must not be denotified as wildlife sanctuary and a RAMSAR site.
7.    The proposed sites on l&P land for labour camp material depot, machinery and
equipment yard, the link roads are the safest and are recommended.
8.    The proposed project design fulfills the desired objects and has been adopted.

the following objectives:
* Eliminate the scare that the canals will remain closed during the construction of the
barrage for about four years. It was clarified that due measures will be taken that
canals would run as per usual programme and canal closure will take place only
under the notified canal closure programmes as follows:

No change would be made in the existing capacity of canals, so no effect shall be impacted
on the canal command area. It was explained that project aimed at rehabilitating the Taunsa
Barrage and not to change the capacity of the barrage or increase or decrease the capacity
of canals.
* Eliminate the fear that for Contractor's labour camp, Material Depot, Machinery Yard,
access roads and work site, some private agricultural lands shall be acquired and
occupied and for that state does not possess a healthy record. Lands are occupied
immediately but compensation is delayed for generations. It was clarified that no private
land shall be required at all for the sub-weir, labour camp, material depot, machinery
yard, access roads or work basis. With the help of a map it was shown to the community
that adequate Irrigation & Power Department land and link roads existed to
accommodate all the requirement. No private agricultural land shall be acquired or
occupied so there was no question of compensation, resettlement or rehabilitation. And
the question of delayed compensation died down naturally.
* Settle down the concern that the workers and labour will be brought by the Contractor
from outside the project area and an opportunity of employment, generated by Taunsa
area shall be availed by people from other areas.
The community gathering was informed that it had been put as a condition in the Tender
Document as well as the Contract Document that maximum employment shall be offered to

the local labour/workers. On their question as to how much would be the employment, they
were given the following illustrative numbers:
Table 6.3

Total                   2,000
The community expressed their satisfaction on the proposed arrangement.
* Fishermen of the community expressed the concern that the high level of construction
activity and noise level generated by it will disturb the Fish downstream the barrage
where fishing was allowed. They were informed that the construction activity will be
restricted to area downstream between 800 - 1500. The fish is mostly in calm water
behind the spurs. Their fishing activity downstream the new weir will proceed as per
rules of the Fisheries Department.
* Question was posed by the community that presence of some 2000 male members of
labour from general locality of project will not only restrict the chances of women
employment, but also cause moral and social problems for the free movement of local
women-folk in the area. It was clarified that strict discipline would be exercised on the
labour force by providing stringent clauses in the contract document. To cull out the
possibility of any moral issues or HIV/AIDS spread, a well organized campaign shall be
run. And if some women were interested in working on the project, they were most
welcome.
* With heavy project traffic on Kot Adu-Taunsa main road there is higher likelihood of road
accidents. It was clarified that due signology and necessary training would be adapted to
exclude possibility of road accidents. Efforts would be made that the work is generally
restricted to day light hours when possibility of road accident is lesser.

WVith arrival of about 2000 additional persons, the prices of commodities in Kot Adu and
Taunsa markets would go up, and price index would go unfriendly for the local villagers.
It was clarified by some trade oriented people within the community that instead of rise in
price those would fall because larger market activity reduces the profit margin and the
price. General discussion on this point ended up in favour of the trade oriented group.
* The following points came up in open acceptance of the project:
> Greater employment opportunity was most welcome.
> Greater economic activity will alleviate poverty.
> Taunsa Barrage will be saved and given a longer lease of life and thus the
dependent agriculture.
>  Present level of services i.e., electricity, communication, schooling, water supply etc.,
is likely to improve.
>  Main Road will be improved making it traffic worthy for normal traffic and additional
traffic.
>  Due to sanctuary, there is no fishing activity upstream of barrage. Diversification of
the opportunity of employment will help the fishermen to get employed on barrage.
* All the above points were reflected in Social Framework Agreement (SFA) from
community side while community obligations were included from the Irrigation and Power
Department.
6.3 PUBLIC HEARING
Fifteen days earlier then the Public hearing it was announced in the press and through local
publicity methods e.g., personal contacts, beat of drums, announcement on mosque
loudspeakers that a public hearing of Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation Project would be held
on August 23, 2004 at 11 AM at Dera Ghazi Khan as the town was almost in the middle of
the extended area of influence of the Project. The gathering took place in Irrigation Rest
House, Dera Ghazi Khan under the Chairmanship of Director EPA Punjab. Representatives
of all relevant Departments of District Government, Members of the press, the
representatives of Irrigation & Power Department and some 50 farmers or persons
interested in the welfare of Taunsa Barrage joined the gathering. Irrigation & Power
Department gave general introduction of the Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation Project and the

Environmental Impact Assessment and
Mitigation Measures






Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
7. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION MEASURES
This section identifies the potential impacts of barrage rehabilitation works on the physical,
biological and socio-economic environment. The physical environment can further be split into
those impacting the soil, water and ambient air.
7.1 POTENTIAL IMPACT SOURCES
Environmental and social impact attributable to the Project can broadly be classified into those
taking place before construction and those occurring during operations. Some of the impacts
can be anticipated and avoided through appropriate adjustments/provisions in the project
design. Some can be mitigated by careful implementation of the Project while some other can
be adjusted with by appropriately following the operational manual and an affective
collaboration with communities.
Construction related impacts are heavily dependent on:-
*  The contractor's work habits, especially those related to the storage of construction
materials and cleanliness of work site;
.  Cooperation between local communities and local authorities and the contractor in terms of
observance of Social Framework Agreement (SFA) and use of public space and utilities;
.  Project management's enforcement of correct construction practices and standards;
and
*  The incorporation of mitigation measures identified in the EIA into the bid documents and
specifications.
* An effective collaboration with local communities in evolving a workable Social Framework
Agrement (SFA).
Operational impacts are usually linked, to the increase in the movement of project activities,
and the absolute volume on project works. These include increase in air, noise pollution,
accident, obstructions to borrowing process and disturbance in construction schedule.
In well designed and carefully executed projects, such effects are expected to be minimal. The
main impacts during construction are, therefore, expected to be of routine nature, and
effectively mitigable.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
The major operational issues are therefore related to the functioning of the completed gateless
weir in the physical environment and in particular to its effects on local hydrology and river flow.
For this Project, potential project impacts are reviewed under the following headings and by
pre-construction (design), construction and operational phases. The environments has been
studied under the following sub-heads:-
* Physical Environment
-     Land Resource
-     Hydrology and Water Resource
-     Air Quality
-     Noise Level
* Biological Environment
-     Flora
-     Fauna
-     Fish
-     Endangered Species
* Cultural and Historical Sites
* Socio-economic Environment
Table 7.1 provides a check list of potential impacts associated with the barrage rehabilitation
project in general divided into groups based on general environmental aspects which are
effected or likely to be effected from the modification in the flow of the river. The set of
impacts based upon physical, biological, cultural and social have been classified under pre-
construction (design), construction and operational phases. Each sub-factor has been
assessed as slight, moderate or significant. The assessed category has then been marked
as curable, reversible or irreversible. Each sub-factor so assessed has been shortly
discussed and explained in the part of the Chapter 7 following the Assessment Table 7.1.

7.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Table 7.1 provides a summary of the possible adverse environmental factors at pre-
construction, construction and operational phase and their degree of significance. This
section provides a brief explanation of each factor and suggests a mitigation measure for
that.
7.2.1 Preconstruction Phase
Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation Project mainly addresses the defects which have developed
over past 50 years in the overall design of the barrage and if not mitigated will threaten the very
existence of Taunsa Barrage and its allied benefits. The main defects of high significance which
are being addressed are:-
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                    7-8



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Retrogression accompanied by pulsating Hydraulic jump, damage to friction blocks, reduction
in discharge capacity of the barrage, excessive exit gradient, increased risk of piping failure and
limitation to lead across the weir from 30 feet down to 22 feet.
Mitigation Construction of a weir with appropriate design leading to elimination of these
defects. Appropriate site is between 800' to 1500' downstream.
Uprootina of the friction blocks where top one foot thick reinforced cement concrete
(1:2:5) skin is not constructed monolithic with the underlying main mass concrete owing to
which there exists a cleavage plan between the top skin concrete and main mass concrete.
The mix ratio of 1:2.7:7 mass concrete is weak inherently. In addition its quality control was
not proper.
Mitigation Through Proper design good specifications and monolicity ought to be esured.
* Oblique River Approach to Barrage On account of oblique river approach to the barrage
from right, the exit currents on the downstream also follow oblique direction. The oblique
exit results in formation of oblique jets, which sometimes are very strong and cause a
haywire turbulence which hamper the dissipation of energy thus worsening the condition in
the stilling basin.
Mitigation While designing the rehabilitation of the project, provide appropriate river training
works and provide a built in design for avoiding an oblique jet followed by disturbance in the
stilling basin.
* Deficient thickness of downstream floor The weir and undersluice floor of Taunsa
Barrage were designed as gravity type floor. But the design defects led to lifting of skin
concrete and shattering it into pieces.
Mitigation While redoing the downstream floor, the design should be prepared carefully and
specifications should be of high standard.
. Damage to glacis The glacis downstream of the gate line is badly abraded. The
reinforcement exposed by the eroded concrete has also been worn away to the extent that
pieces of reinforcement have fallen apart.
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                     7-9



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Mitigation This serious design defect can be removed by a proper design accompanied by
standard specifications at the design stage.
7.2.2 Construction Phase
(a)   Land Resources
* Site for waste construction material
There is hardly any cutting involved. Most of the work would involve filling. There shall not
be much waste material for disposal or burial. If any such material does need a disposal,
enough land is available within 46 acres of Bela land where all activities pertaining to
Taunsa Barrage can be disposed off. Most suitable spot for such disposal is in the north-
eastern corner of the large piece of land of l&P Department.
Mitigation To be made contractor's obligation through contract document. This is a significant
but mitigable matter.
* Adiustment with unstable locations aPpearin-q durinq construction
In view of the calcareous and clayey nature of right bank some unprecedented situations may
be confronted.
Mitiqation Local readjustment in foundation treatment will be allowed to the contractor by the
RE.
* Location of Labour Camps, Material Camps. Equipment Yards and aDproach roads
Because of availability of l&P Department land and old workshop site, this will not cause any
serious problem.
Mitigation The Contractor will, in consultation with Resident Engineer, resolve the exact
location of all these facilities. In case the contractor opts to make his own arrangements, no
responsibility shall fall on Irrigation & Power Department.
* Limitations of Construction Site other than aiven at 2.1.2
Such situations may arise due to river behaviour or any unanticipated social event.
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                      7-10



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Mitigation Contractor in consultation with Resident Engineer will be contractually bound to
resolve the issues(s), in the best interest of Irrigation & Power Department.
* Rehabilitation of Project borrow sites and Sites for storage of materials
Although these will be located in the l&P Department land, yet these must be restored to their
best conditions before the contractor closes his work. The borrow areas will be located on the
outer side of the upstream guide bunds.
Mitigation Contractor's obligation to restore the sites to their best form as per satisfaction of
Resident Engineer. Ordinarily, such borrow areas get filled with spill of the river and the
sediments even them out in due course.
* Stabilization of sites on earth fill works
This is highly significant check point.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation and strict supervision by Resident Engineer.
* Agriculture Land or Crop Destruction
No agricultural land is involved anywhere in the project implementation. But at times such a
situation may arise due to mistake of contractor's labour or vehicle drivers, or Contractor's
deliberate option.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation to compensate the farmers immediately. Such an
act by Contractor shall not accrue any responsibility on the Irrigation & Power Department.
* Contamination from diesel and other Spills from construction machinerv
At places it may be inevitable.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation to impose strict rules not to cause spills. If it does,
it must be followed by mopping up.
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                      7-11

Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation.
* Any Discharge or diversion of water to any graveyard
No such situation has been noticed so far. If it does at any stage it must be secured through rip-
rap work.
Mitigation Contingency may be provided in the BOQ and it should be entrusted to Contractor
as his contractual obligation.
* Any discharge. spill or dumpina onto any Building or house on river bank
No such situation has been noticed during surveys. Should a situation present itself during
project implementation, the owner may be compensated by the contractor.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation to compensate such losses.
(b)   Hydrology and water resources
* Sources of construction water
Ordinarily the river water is suitable. If obtained elsewhere, it must be compensated.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation to pay for water obtained from source other than
river.
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                     7-12

*  Diesel and other fluids spillina over the River from construction company
Same care as for material depots.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation to not to let it happen. Should it happen it must
be duly mopped up.
* Protection of construction work from floods
A suitable flood warning system from l&P Department and full arrangement to save the box in
the river.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation to make fool proof arrangements in advance.
* Obstruction of water downstream
River flow downstream shall be facilitated by suitable arrangements agreed between the
contractor and the Resident Engineer.
Mitigation Contractor's contractual obligation.
* Effects of Surface flow conditions
Must be addressed at design stage.
Mitigation Design Engineer to accommodate this factor in the design so as to avoid negative
impacts.
(c)   Air Quality and Noise Pollution
The possible impacts on air quality and noise level could be as follows:
*  Dust and smoke and other pollutants from construction machinery.
*  Dust or other pollutants from stored materials and spoil heaps.
*  Smoke from burning of waste materials or burning firewood.
*  Noise from use of old and outdated machinery.
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                     7-13



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
Mitiaation Contractor's contractual obligation to keep these impacts under control by using
machinery which is well maintained and is almost noiseless. 20 kacha roads are sprinked with
water many times a day. Gas stoves are used in labour camps. The stored materials are
secured properly. RE makes strict inspections of all these facilities.
(d)   Biological Resources
The anticipated biological impacts can be on the following:
*  Damage to flora, fauna or biota.
* Damage to Indus Dolphin upstream or downstream.
* Disturbance to Taunsa Game Sanctuary as a RAMSAS site.
Mitigation
1. Contractor's obligation to strictly respect the limits of construction site, and not to enter the
wildlife sanctuary area at all.
2. Continuous inspection of the area jointly with other agencies involved in maintenance of
protected areas.
3. Provision of Fish Ladders and Navigation Lock, in the new weir.
(e)   Socio-economic and cultural issues
These could be:-
*  Disturbance to existing services; education, health, electricity, water supply or sinology.
*  Aggravation of any Tribal Tensions and local rivalries on dispute on canal water or aquatic
life.
*  Aggravation of dispute on land ownership.
*  Any need for land acquisition.
*  Access to other construction materials.
*  Adverse effects on known archaeological sites.
*  Dealing with chance finds.
*  Dealing with grave yards or burials.
*  Problem to ensuring public safety at construction site.
*  Problem to Health and Safety of Labour and employees on construction work.
*  Employment of locals.

1. Social Framework Agreement (SFA) with communities to ensure their participation in
matters pertaining to them.
2. All matters to be attended by the contractor, to be made his contractual obligation.
7.2.3 Operational Phase
At operational phase the Project Manager shall develop a comprehensive operational and
Maintenance Manual as per ISO Standards. Monitoring and Evaluation has to be done as per
operational manual and monitoring plan. Mistakes at operational level or handling of operations
by untrained staff can prove very costly. Important points to be attended at operation stage are
as follows:
*  Comprehensive O&M Rules as per ISO Standard.
*  Strict application of prescribed M&E Plan.
*  Continuous evaluation of design efficiency.
*  Understanding and Training of Operational Manual.
*  Environmental Annual Audit.
*  Regular Maintenance of Engineering Works.
*  Staff Welfare.
*  Continued Public Consultation.
*  Continued attention towards Gender Issues and Women Consultations.
*  Canals to run upto their capacity and not beyond.
*  Refresher courses for operational staff.
The operational life of the rehabilitation work and the rehabilitated Taunsa Barrage shall be
directly proportionate to the degree of seriousness attached with the above operational and
maintenance obligations.
7.3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
In ultimate analysis, the impacts of the project on social and economic activities in the area will
be mostly positive. The economic analysis shows very high economic benefits compared to
cost. The economic benefits of the project are:

i.    Boost to agriculture through ensured and enhanced irrigation in at least three Districts of
Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
ii.   Increased economic activity will improve transport and will ensure easy marketing of
agricultural produce and the Mango crops.
iii.  With improved economy, there shall be improvement in service areas and wider
opportunities for employment, education, healthcare especially for women and children.
iv.   Possible stimulus to other diversified economic development such as Tourism
development programmes.
v.    Employment during construction, a large number of semi and unskilled workers in the
service area will be hired.
vi.   Greater awareness about Health care including HIV/AIDS amongst the labour and the
closely community.
At micro-level, the hustle and bustle of the economic activities may bring the cost of living down
by making essential commodities at cheaper rates. This combined with higher incidence of
employment will bring the poverty line from 38% to 25%.

8. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
8.1 GENERAL
This Chapter contains the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the Project. It has three
components:
*  Mitigation Plan
*  Monitoring Plan
*  Institutional Strengthening
Most of the proposed EMP mitigation activities will be assured under provisions in the
Engineering Design, provisions in the construction contracts, Engineering Supervision contract
and as necessary by agreement with communities.
8.2 MITIGATION PLAN
The mitigation plan includes measures to mitigate potential negative project effects and
enhance its positive impacts (as analysed and brought forth in Chapter 7) during initial physical
works and normal operations of the barrage. These are summarized in this section in a
comprehensive EMP in Table 8.1. This table also provides a "check list" for those responsible
for implementation and monitoring of EMP.

8.3 MITIGATION (AVOIDANCE) OF ADVERSE IMPACTS AT DESIGN PHASE
Built in, inherent and devastatingly negative impacts can be invited through an unsound design
and most negative factors can be avoided (eliminated) through the use of improved and
environmentally sound technical designs. Usually, the engineers find a compromise
somewhere in between to adjust with the available finances. The secondary weir has, however,
been designed on modern lines, in fact imbibing state of the art model. It has been ensure that
the old age defects, which have appeared over past 50 years, are eliminated and no similar
defects ever reappear. Most significant of these negative impacts have been listed and
discussed in this report, at various places, under Pre-construction (Design) phase mitigation. To
name them, these are Retrogression, Uprooting of friction blocks, oblique river approach
deficient thickness of downstream floor and damage to glacis. The project in hand in fact is a
rehabilitation move for the old project through a sound design.
8.4 TENDER AND CONSTRUCTION PHASE
8.4.1 Impact Reduction Measures
There are specific measures required of contractor to reduce the potential impacts of physical
works and also the proposals for monitoring contractor's compliance/performance during
construction. These measures will be detailed in the construction tenders.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
The contract document will contain requirements for:
*  Proper management of construction waste.
*  Control measure for waste fuel.
*  Oil lubricants; reduction of noise and dust level.
*  Rehabilitation of areas used for construction detours and sites used to temporarily store
construction materials.
*  Use and proper maintenance of equipment with appropriate noise and smoke abatement
control.
Specific provisions will also be included to mandate the use of formal health and safety
measures to minimize accidents and avoid fatalities during the construction process.
Advisory elements to address a number of other issues will also be included in the contract.
These will include:
*  Road Closures: For transporting construction material or conveying heavy machinery to
the site, main barrage road may have to be temporarily closed and access of public for
certain period may have to be blocked. The dates, timings and duration of such periods will
need to be agreed with authorities and communities.
*  Cultural and Historical Resources: Communities shall be requested to identify in the field
all known sites of cultural and historical value that may be affected by the project for the
contractor.
*  Archaeological Field Support: The Government of the Punjab will make available (on
demand) a qualified archaeologist to conduct field investigations when important search
work and new material sites are opened. No such site is yet in view but just in case it does,
the services of archaeologist can be had.
*  Graveyard and Burials: If unrecorded graveyards and/or burials are found during the
course of construction activities, the supervision agency will contact and work with local
religious authorities within the project area to allow for possible identification of the remains
and when appropriate, properly undertake relocation and burial.

Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
* Local Employment: The contractor is advised that both unskilled labour and skilled
masons/mistries/store workers are easily available from local communities as and when
required. There is no obligation to hire local labour but it is desirable that some employment
benefits are made available to local communities.
* Land Acquisition and other compensation: During the community consultation, in the
project area, it was made clear by the communities hat they would expect due
compensation, if in anyway their buildings, trees or land was affected or destroyed during
construction of the secondary weir or any of its allied structures. Uptil now, in this project, no
such case is involved.
* Resource use Agreements - Construction Materials: Earth is available along protection
bunds from Government land. The river bed sand is fit for use in construction. Stones are
available from Sakhi Sarwar in Dera Ghazi Khan at about 112 Kms from the construction
site. Yet there may be a need for additional agreements with public to obtain materials. In
that case the Farm land should be given the lowest priority in sourcing the fill material
wherever the borrow pits are dug, considerable care should be taken in its location. The site
may invariably be rehabilitated after use. Ideal is that the site is made good to a condition
similar to that prior to the project. It will be helpful if photographs of pre-project condition
may be used for comparative purposes.
* Resource use Agreements - Water: Although ample quantities of good water are
available as surface and ground water in the project area, yet, the contractor will be
required to detail daily water demands and indicate source of water prior to the start of
construction. It may also be required as to the disposal of waste water without polluting
fertile soil, clean river water or ambient air.
8.4.2 Pretender Conference
To ensure full understanding of above clauses by prospective contractors, all prequalified
contractors will attend a pre-tender conference, where they will be briefed on their
responsibilities with regard to environmental, social and health and safety issues. These
briefings will review specific provisions of the construction tender documents and contracts.

8.4.3 Preconstruction Coordination Meeting
Once a contract is awarded the contactor will be required to attend coordination meeting(s) with
project authorities and local communities. At these meetings the Project Manager and the
Resident Engineer of the Project will further explain the Terms and Conditions of the Contract,
especially the narrated above, if possible with respect to specified physical sites listed in the
contract document.
8.5 OPERATIONAL PHASE - MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONAL IMPACTS
The Project will also address future maintenance impacts. These may be implemented through
specially requested financial support through Finance Department as recurring budget to avoid
deterioration of the rehabilitated barrage and associated hydrological problems. Maintenance
agency/contractor will be required to follow procedures similar to those for the construction
contractors concerning proper disposal of construction waste, control measure, for waste fuel,
oil and lubricants and adoption of health and safety measures for personnel.
8.6 MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL IMPACTS
Social Impact will be managed primarily through Social Framework Agreement (SFA between
Irrigation & Power Department, and the communities living in the vicinity of the Project area.
The SFA will be drafted and signed when the project is finally approved and the implementation
commences. A draft agreement has been provided which may be updated, if any clause is
missing.
8.7 MONITORING PLAN
* Environmental Impacts
The Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) will be implemented by the Resident Engineer or a
Monitoring and Evaluation Officer or a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, specially authorized for
this purpose by the Irrigation & Power Department. For further description such authorized
person may be called the M&E Unit.
NDC I NESPAK I ATKINS                                                    8-10



Punjab Barrages Rehabilitation Project Phase-I
The M&E Unit will monitor application of environmental measures for detailed design,
construction and bidding for rehabilitation contracts for the barrage. The results of M&E
activities will be included as a routine elements of reports prepared by the Project Manager, the
Irrigation & Power Department and the visiting World Bank Mission.
The monitoring programme will comprise of the site inspections designed to determine
contractor compliance or otherwise with the EMP and other applicable regulations and statutes.
Monitoring programme designed to provide quantitative assessments of environmental
parameters under pre and post project conditions are not proposed. It is agreed that:
* Any project effects will be easily identified by site inspections and in discussions with site
incharge(s), RE, and local communities.
*  The project is a localized activity and the changes to the environment are likely to be
minimum.
*  Except for some unanticipated factors, originating from off site facilities, the Project is not
likely to cause any disamenity to the communities anywhere, even for a limited period. At off
site facilities, if needed, inspections (and complaints if any) will indicate whether any further
action needs to be taken.
The proposed site inspections should be carried out on a regular basis but not necessarily to a
structured pattern. However, as a minimum, M&E activity the programme outlined in Table 8-2
below should be observed:

100% completion stage.
One visit to other project sites every quarters.
03.      Post Construction     One visit to each constructed site (part) site during
construction.
Two visits to each remediation site 12-18 months after
rehabilitation and modernization of barrage.
It is also anticipated that additional inspection will be required in response to any complaints by
local communities. So another two visits per quarter may be budgeted for M&E Units.
For the inspection process to function, access to the project and other related sites must be
guaranteed. Accordingly, the contract documents and operating documents shall incorporate a
phrase with similar intent to that outlined below:
Any officer authorized in writing by Project Manager/lrrigation & Power Department or
Environmental Protection Council (EPC), may at any time enter any premises whether
prescribed or otherwise and may:
* Examine and inspect equipment, control equipment, monitoring equipment or plant.
Take samples of any pollutants that are emitted, discharged or deposited, or are likely
to be or are of a class or kind that are usually emitted, discharged or deposited from
such premises.
*  Examine any books, records or documents relating to the performance or use of such
equipment, control equipment, monitoring equipment or plant or relating to the emission,
discharge or deposit from such premises.
*  Photograph such premises as he considers necessary or make copies of any book,
records or documents seen in the course of such examination.
After construction the sub-weir will require only limited maintenance. There are no facilities,
maintenance yards or any other sites proposed to be developed specifically for the project
operation and maintenance. There will, therefore, be no requirement for a fixed program of site
inspections during this phase. Resources should however be made for a limited program of
random inspections intended to ensure that maintenance contractors comply with the

procedures outlined for all contractors with regard to such matters as waste materials disposal,
and the application of appropriate health and safety measures.
* Socio-economic Impact
A programme is proposed to monitor key social development and economic indicators as a
means of defining overall project performance.
These indicators include:
*  Area expanded under Agriculture
*  Prices of essential commodities (cost of living)
*  Any improvement in marketing of Agri produce
*  Other poverty and gender indicators
* Any Improvement in performance of main barrage and canals.
These socio-economic indicators have been selected on the bases of the base line data
collected for this project.

8.10.4 Operational Manual
However perfect the design may be and however meticulous the construction may be,
barrage often fail to achieve their full objectives if there no operational manual or the
provisions of the operational manual are not faithfully implemented. For post construction
phase of the project, it is recommended, that a board based team of experts is tasked to
develop a comprehensive operational manual for the rehabilitated Taunsa Barrage complex.
The manual should also include a provision of continuous pre-training of the staff who have
to be put on operational or maintenance duties. An effective monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) system should make an integral part of the operational manual by way of providing a
check list fro every operational and maintenance stage. As provided in the EMP, following
points must be included in the operational manual:
(i)   Strict application of the prescribed M&E plan.
(ii)  Continuous evaluation of design efficiency.
(iii)  Training sessions for understanding and operating the manual.
(iv)  Annual audit of environment (comparison of what is happening against he set
standards) to be conducted by an independent 3rd party.
(v)   Regular maintenance (not repair).
(vi)  Staff welfare.
(vii)  Continuous public consultation (PR).
