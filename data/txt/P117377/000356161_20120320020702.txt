                                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. This paper proposes the restructuring of the Emergency Project for the Prevention and
   Management of Influenza Type Illness and Strengthening of Argentina's Epidemiological
   System (A/H1N1 Project - Loan 7843-AR, P117377). The restructuring proposes to: (i) extend the
   Project’s closing date by 12 months from March 31, 2012, to March 31, 2013, (ii) modify Table 1 of
   the Emergency Project Paper: “Project Indicators by Intermediate Outcomes and Project
   Components?, and (iii) reallocate loan proceeds. The restructuring would allow the Project to fully
   achieve its targets.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The A/H1N1 Project was prepared under OP/BP 8.00 Rapid Response to Crisis and
   Emergencies, and was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on
   February 23, 2010. It was declared effective on April 14, 2010, and on April 27, 2011, a Project
   restructuring was approved to: (i) process a partial cancelation of US$88 million of the loan amount;
   and (ii) reallocate loan proceeds. As of March 8, 2012, the Project disbursed US$132.15 million of
   the loan amount (94%), and has an undisbursed balance of US$8.2 million (6%).

3. The Project’s Development Objective is to support the Nation’s high-level objective to reduce its
   burden of disease related to infectious and transmitted diseases, and specifically acute respiratory
   infections (ARI). This requires improvements to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and
   its epidemiological surveillance system for the prevention and control of influenza-related illness,
   through strengthening the capacity of Argentina’s epidemiological health surveillance system to: (a)
   prevent, monitor and evaluate influenza activity; and (b) control epidemic waves of A/H1N1
   influenza.

4. The Project's overall implementation progress is satisfactory. The Mid-Term Review (MTR)
   conducted between November 17 and 22, 2011 rated progress towards achieving the Project
   objectives as satisfactory, especially because of the achievement of the flagship indicator of A/H1N1
   vaccination coverage, the Project's contribution to strengthening the National Health Surveillance
   System (SNVS), and the country's reduction of all types of influenza-like illness. However, regarding
   the Pneumococcal vaccine indicator, the Ministry of Health (MOH) certified that only 366,177
   vaccines were given out of 700,000 expected -- a 52% coverage level, instead of the 90% target. This
   insufficient coverage level points to an initial overestimation of the target and the use of a different
   “campaign strategy? (namely, using vaccines in and out of health facilities, visiting houses, schools,

                                                    5
   etc) than that of introducing the vaccine in the annual National Calendar of the EPI (vaccines mostly
   used in health facilities). This alternative campaign tends to produce under-reporting and relies on
   inadequate logistical arrangements in some Provinces. The Project also has highly satisfactory
   compliance with safeguards, and has achieved high levels of coordination between the MOH and the
   Provinces, as well as within different units of the MOH (such as the Department of Epidemiology, the
   Vaccines Unit-EPI, the Surveillance Units and hospitals).

5. The Project has produced strategic and operational advances in the monitoring and control of
   the A/H1N1 flu epidemic in Argentina, transforming the crisis into an opportunity and contributing
   significantly to improvements in public health using a Results-Based Financing approach. The
   following are the most relevant achievements:

       (i)     A stronger epidemiological surveillance system using outputs for monitoring and
               verification of sentinel sites for influenza and the development of mechanisms to train
               105 epidemiology officials to improve the technical quality of analysis produced in the
               recently created 37 “Situation Rooms? in all 24 Provinces.
       (ii)    The development of a health sector communication strategy at the provincial level
               through outputs oriented to the development and implementation of 379 nationwide
               Operational Modules of Social Communication (MOCS) and 36 MOCS adapted for
               Indigenous Peoples to increase public awareness of influenza, encourage prevention
               through vaccination, and promote self-care against the transmission of infectious
               diseases.
       (iii)   High coverage levels. Vaccination against A/H1N1 in the country started on February 22,
               2010, and now covers over 94% of the targeted population at risk, surpassing the Project
               target of 90%. This accounts for the highest coverage rate of the eligible population in the
               Latin America Region for the winter season.
       (iv)    Stronger immune prevention of ARIs, as evidenced by the 2010 distribution of the
               influenza vaccine to groups considered at-risk, and plans to begin pneumococcal
               vaccinations in 2012.
       (v)     A stronger quality of care through the refurbishing of 37.3% of beds in the country's
               public system (608 equipped beds of intermediate health care distributed in 208
               hospitals).

6. However, the Project must still make progress with its implementation in order to sustain
   reductions of ARIs. To build on current achievements without modifying the strategy or
   implementation arrangements, the Project aims to achieve the following objectives:

       (i)     Achieve the pneumococcal vaccine indicator target and make the advances achieved to
               date in the A/H1N1 vaccination campaign sustainable. To do this, the Project will
               incorporate pneumococcal and A/H1N1 vaccines into the annual National Calendar of the
               EPI. The pneumococcal vaccine for children under two years of age was introduced into
               the National Calendar on January 1, 2012.




                                                   6
        (ii)    Include a new indicator to monitor the reviewed strategy, as well as a goal related to the
                “Dose of Pneumococcal vaccine applied?.
        (iii)   Consolidate advances in epidemiological surveillance and quality of analysis in public
                health, carried out by training 105 epidemiology officials. This will require additional
                certification of the 37 “Situation Rooms? created in all 24 Provinces.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7. Extension of Project’s closing date. The Borrower requested a 12-month extension of the closing
   date, from March 31, 2012, to March 31, 2013. The extension is necessary to: (i) integrate the
   pneumococcal vaccine campaign into the nation’s regular vaccination schedule with the purpose of
   achieving the agreed 85% doses coverage; (ii) strengthen the capacity and quality of the Health
   Situation Rooms (HSR) to contribute to the public health intelligence system, upgrading the
   “certification? through a second “accreditation? process; (iii) improve the monitoring of project
   performance (by adding a new monitoring indicator for quality improvements of the HSR); (iv)
   strengthen the country's mobile emergency and urgency system, by completing the ongoing
   procurement process for ambulances; and (v) complete impact evaluation and ongoing operational
   research on strategies for vaccination and epidemiological surveillance, ensuring the Project’s lessons
   will be identified and disseminated. This is the Project’s first extension. The Project objectives,
   Project description, and Project implementation arrangements will not be modified by the
   introduction of these adjustments.

8. Reallocation of Loan Proceeds. The Borrower proposes a reallocation of Loan Proceeds to:

        a) Increase the amount of Category 1 (non consultancy and consultancy services) in order to
           provide financing for an additional year of training activities, consolidate the strengthening of
           the epidemiological surveillance system; and extend the Independent Technical Audit (ITA).
        b) Reduce the amount of Category 2 (Goods) to reflect the activities already initiated in the
           Procurement Plan for 2011 and 2012.
        c) Increase the amount of Category 3 (outputs under Part 1(a)) in order to provide financing for
           an additional year for the operating Situation Rooms, consolidating the achievements in the
           epidemiological surveillance system.
        d) Reduce the amount of Category 4 (outputs under Part 2 (b)) and Category 3 (operating costs).

9. The Government of Argentina (GOA) requested the Project’s restructuring in a letter sent to
   the Bank on December 14, 2011. The above proposal was discussed with the Bank team during
   the MTR mission and was found to be acceptable. The GOA will submit to the Bank team an
   Addendum of the Project’s Operations Manual in order to reflect the above changes in the outputs
   under part 1(a).

    11. Adjustments in the monitoring of Project’s Indicators. The Borrower has proposed adjustments to
        the Project Indicators so as to improve monitoring of Project performance without modifying the
        Project’s outcomes.


                                                           8
    For Component 1:

    1) Revise the target of “Health Situation Rooms Certified? Indicator, from 40 to 38.

12. At present, 37 out of 40 Situation Rooms have been developed and approved by the MOH, and the
    certification process was successfully concluded as planned in the second half of 2011. The target for
    this indicator was mistakenly stated at appraisal. Instead of 40 situation rooms, the target should have
    been 38. Using a population criteria, HSRs are distributed according to the following scheme:

                   13 in the Province of Buenos Aires,
                   2 in the Province of Santa Fe,
                   2 in the Province of Córdoba,
                   1 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires,
                   1 in each of the rest of the Provinces (a total of 20).

    2) Add the following new monitoring Indicator: Health Situation Rooms - Level II Accredited?
    from 0 to 16.

13. This new indicator will improve the monitoring of Project performance by measuring quality
    improvements of the HSRs. Given that 19 out of 38 HSRs achieved 100% commitment of planned
    activities during the first year of certification, the Borrower requested the introduction of a second
    level of certification for the HSRs to support and consolidate their role in strengthening the
    epidemiologic surveillance system. The proposed indicator is for 16 Situation Rooms accredited --
    out of the 19 certified – to achieve a highly satisfactory level of quality at the end of the Project.

For Component 2:

    1) Revise the target of “Dose of Pneumococcal vaccine applied? Indicator from 90% to 85%.

14. After the 2010 vaccination campaign, the MOH certified 366,177 vaccines were applied out of the
    700,000 doses - 52% of coverage instead of the 90% target for the indicator. According to the
    Government, under-reporting of doses applied in the health facilities was the main reason the target
    was not achieved. The Government expects to improve results in 2012 by adding vaccination to the
    Annual Calendar but nonetheless requested to reduce the target to 85%. This target is a realistic and
    ensures a technically sufficient coverage goal, given the recent introduction of the vaccine in the
    country. The supervision team agrees with the proposed change.

    2) Add the following new monitoring Indicators: “Dose of A/H1N1 and Dose of Pneumococcal
    vaccines included in National Calendar applied?, from 0% to 80% in 2012 for the A/H1N1
    vaccine, and from 50% to 80% for the Pneumococcal vaccine in 2012.

15. The MOH is redirecting its immunization strategy to an integrated respiratory disease prevention
    strategy, which involves the inclusion of A/H1N1 and pneumococcal vaccines in the regular schedule
    of the National Calendar. The A/H1N1 vaccine was introduced in the 2011 Calendar, while the

                                                      9
   pneumococcal vaccine for children under two years of age was introduced in the National Calendar
   starting on January 1, 2012. Thus, the proposed new indicators aim to monitor the new strategy.

   3) Add a new monitoring indicator for “Inpatient treatment provided in hospitalization due to
   acute respiratory infections?, from 0 to not less than 30,000 inpatients treatments.

16. Given the success of the vaccination campaign and the substantial reduction of the virus
    communicability, the overall number of treatments provided in hospitalization of A/H1N1 cases
    decreased during 2010 and 2011. The Government proposed to add a new indicator related to
    inpatient treatments due to acute respiratory illness.

   4) Adjustments on the indicator “Influenza diagnostic laboratory tests carried out in 2010 and
   2011? target.

17. The indicator target was set to 54,000 Diagnostic Lab tests for influenza performed (based on
    Nominal registry of the “Sistema de Vigilancia de Laboratorios? - SIVILA). The Government
    explained that SIVILA reports laboratory tests without specifying names, thus, the information is
    added on a per case basis instead of nominally (i.e. per individual name). For that reason, the Bank
    agrees the phrase “Nominal registry? should be removed.
