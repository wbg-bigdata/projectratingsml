1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.        Following the detection of A/H1N1 Influenza virus in Mexico in April 2009,
the disease quickly spread and was declared a worldwide pandemic. By May,
widespread infection had occurred in North America and by June 73 countries had
reported over 25,000 laboratory confirmed cases.1 On June 11, 2009 the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared the Influenza Outbreak a phase six pandemic, signaling
that the virus had sustained community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a
different WHO region and that a pandemic was underway.

2.         Argentina was strongly impacted, resulting in high mortality and morbidy
rates. 2 On May 10, 2009 A gentina’s epidemiological su veillance system detected the
first clinical case of A/H1N1 among passengers returning from Mexico. Following the
initial case, the virus spread quickly throughout the country, with peak transmission
occurring during the winter months. By January 2010, the death toll in Argentina had
exceeded 600 people in 21 provinces, higher than in Mexico, while cases of influenza-
like illness and hospitalizations numbered over 1.2 million and 12,000, respectively.3 4

3.        Starting in 2009, Argentina followed an integrated Response Plan for
Influenza Pandemic and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). A quick and
harmonized response between national and provincial governments and an existing
Response Plan regarding coordination, surveillance, vaccines and antiviral treatment,
health services planning and communication contributed to the detection and containment
of the outbreak. The Government of Argentina (GOA) earmarked 1,000 million
Argentine Pesos (about US$260 million) to fight the pandemic through the purchase of
antiviral medication, equipment (respirators, oxygen equipment, and laboratory supplies)
and to hire health staff to respond to increased health service demand. 5 The National
Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud de la Nación -- MSN) unified the count y’s
treatment and diagnostic criteria for epidemic control and distributed health resources to
both public and private health facilities, allowing the population to receive free treatment
for A/H1N1 in all hospitals. Through the Federal Health Council (Consejo Federal de
Salud -- COFESA), the Ministers of Health of each province harmonized measures for

  WHO, Global Alert and Response (GAR) - Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 update. The impact of the pandemic
on countries varied widely according to factors such as the season at the time of the outbreak, the extent of
virus communicability, differences in health care practices and the capacity of the population for response.
(http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8422/en/index/html)

  A striking difference between the A/H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza is that the former seemed to select
people in a younger age cohort. Pregnant women and individuals with underlying conditions were at
higher risk for complications. The true extent of death attributable to A/H1N1 is likely higher since many
people died without being tested.

  The MSN deployed mobile units and hired extra health care workers to compensate and offset the
increased demand.

confronting the pandemic and agreed that funds would be utilized according to strict
health criteria and the jurisdictional needs. Five measures proved especially effective in
the count y’s initial esponse: (i) advancing school ecess by fou weeks to all ow children
to stay home during flu season; (ii) special leave at work for identified risk groups; (iii)
ensuring availability of antiviral treatment to anyone who presented symptoms; (iv)
intensifying a public awareness campaign; and (v) strengthening health care services for
ambulatory and hospitalized patients. In addition, local governments implemented social
distancing measures, temporarily closing mass public activities, such as entertainment
events to reduce viral circulation of the epidemic.

4.       Despite the strengthening of Argentina’s primary health care (Atención
Primaria de Salud) during the previous decade, the epidemic revealed weaknesses in
the system. An evaluation of the count y’s influenza pandemic preparedness revealed
strains on the surveillance and laboratory systems during peak transmission. The
epidemiological surveillance and laboratory systems needed capacity strengthening to
quickly gather data, generate an accurate diagnosis and respond effectively during a
pandemic.

5.        The World Bank collaborated with Argentina during the 2009 A/H1N1
outbreak through the rapid processing of approximately US$7.5 million from the
emergency component of the Essential Public Health Functions I Project (FESP-
P090993, Loan 7412), which was specifically designed to address emergencies and
epidemic outbreaks. Initial technical evaluation of loan proceeds used for A/H1N1
showed the impact that timely funds had mitigating risks, with Argentina allocating the
resources based on a pre-approved plan for Avian Flu. The World Bank had extensive
experience in supporting governments worldwide in preparing for and responding to
influenza epidemics, controlling infectious diseases, and in strengthening national
epidemiological surveillance systems. This experience included that acquired through the
Global Program on Avian Influenza, response to the SARS epidemic, HIV/AIDS
pandemic and dengue epidemic.6

6.        Following up on the emergency component under the FESP I operation,
the GOA asked the World Bank for a new project to prepare for a possible second
A/H1N1 wave.7 Scientific studies and epidemiologists had predicted a second A/H1N1
wave in 2010 and A gentina’s National Immunization ommission (Comisión Nacional
de Inmunizaciones -- CONAIN) recommended the strategic stockpiling of the vaccine as
an element of the seasonal flu vaccine strategy (improving coverage). The Project was
aligned with the World Bank Group’s ount y Pa tne ship St ategy (CPS) 2010-2012
(Report # 48476) discussed by the Executive Directors on May 6, 2009, in which one of
the principal objectives was to consolidate improvements made to the health sector and
complement ongoing activities of the FESP I Project, the Provincial Maternal-Child

  In 2009, in addition to the influenza pandemic, Argentina suffered one of the worst dengue outbreaks
since the reappearance of the disease in the country.

  Once a pandemic wave starts the possibility of a second or more waves (viral activity) is likely because
the same virus remains circulating within the community.

Health Investment Project (P071025, Loan 7225) and the Provincial Maternal-Child
Health Investment Project Second Phase (P095515, Loan 7409) or Plan Nacer. 8 The
Project was closely aligned with three pillars of the CPS: sustainable growth with equity,
social inclusion and improved governance, in which one of the principal objectives was
to consolidate health improvements.

7.       The Project adopted a Results-Based Financing (RBF) mechanism,
considering the successful experience of this scheme in previous World Bank
financed health operations and existing local RBF capacity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.       The PDO was to strengthen the capacity of Argentina’s epidemiological
health surveillance system: (a) to prevent, monitor and evaluate influenza activity;
and (b) to control epidemic waves of the A/H1N1 influenza. The Project’s esults, as
presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), were to be measured through 14
intermediate outcome indicators. The PAD indicates five out of the 14 intermediate
outcome indicators to serve as key indicators for purposes of measuring the PDO,
although not labeled as PDO-level indicators in the PAD results framework.9 Nine of the
intermediate outcome indicators were also output indicators for purposes of disbursement
under the RBF scheme.10 The P oject’s key indicators were:
     Key Indicator 1: Health Situation Rooms (HSR) Certified
     Key Indicator 3: Operational Modules of Social Communication (MOCS)
       implemented
     Key Indicator 5: Dose of A/H1N1 vaccine applied
     Key Indicator 6: Dose of Pneumococcal vaccine applied
     Key Indicator 13: Influenza diagnostic laboratory test carried out in 2010 and
       2011

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.       The original PDO remained valid and unchanged throughout Project
implementation. Two of the key indicators were revised to improve Project performance
monitoring:
 Key Indicator 1: The target for “HSRs Certified?11 was revised from 40 to 38.
   The target for this indicator was mistakenly stated at appraisal. Instead of 40 situation
   rooms, the target should have been 38.


8
   The Project coordinated with Plan Nacer regarding immunization reports (EPI) data to identify the
population to receive vaccination, treatment and education or preventive measures against A/H1N1.
9
  For more information regarding the monitoring framework see pages 62 and 63 of the PAD and Section
2.3 of this ICR.
10
   See section 2.3 for a list of the indicators under the RBF scheme.
11
   Health situation rooms are physical spaces where information is collected and analyzed in order to
facilitate the identification of priority health programs and contribute to effective decision-making. The

                                                    3
     Key Indicator 6: The target for the “Dose of Pneumococcal vaccine applied?
      indicator was revised downward from 90 percent to 85 percent. According to the
      Government, an under-reporting of doses applied in the health facilities was the main
      reason the indicator remained below its target following the 2010 vaccination
      campaign. The Government anticipated an improvement of results in 2011 by adding
      the vaccine to the Annual Calendar but nonetheless requested a target reduction given
      the recent introduction of the vaccine in the country.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.       The Project’s direct beneficiaries included the over 13 million people that
received vaccines, laboratory tests, and ambulatory and intensive care treatment.
A/H1N1 vaccines targeted those most vulnerable to the virus (7.5 million in 2010 and 4.6
million in 2011),12 and pneumococcal vaccines 830,801 high-risk individuals (135,308 in
2010 and 695,493 in 2011). Further, 65,341 (12,432 in 2010 and 52,909 in 2011)
individuals exposed to influenza-like symptoms benefitted from early treatment through
loan-financed lab tests, over two million received ambulatory treatment (2010 and 2011)
and over 100,000 (2010-2012) were treated in hospitals, including those in intensive
health care units. Approximately 200 individuals received training in an epidemiology
postgraduate course.

1.5 Original Components

11.         The Project consisted of the following three components (Annex 2):

         Component 1: Strengthening the capacity of the Borrower’s epidemiological
          health system for surveillance and influenza case-finding (US$10.2 million).
          The component included: (i) expansion and quality improvement of the
          epidemiological surveillance, (ii) activities aimed at coordinating human and
          animal health surveillance, (iii) carrying out of joint research with agencies, (iv)
          carrying out of prevention and vaccination promotion media campaigns at the
          provincial level, and (v) provision of training to health care service providers on
          the management of A/H1N1 influenza pandemic surveillance, hospital infections
          and control, promotion and prevention related aspects.




criteria for HSR certification was based on the following: (i) institutional mechanisms for the integration
and diffusion of information; (ii) health quality improvements; (iii) improvements in the technical quality
of produced analysis; and (iv) HSR functioning.
12
   The A/H1N1 epidemic had a different evolution than other influenza strains, therefore vaccines targeted
the following high-risk groups (approximate numbers): (i) health professionals (1 million); (ii) community
workers (1 million); (iii) pregnant women (700,000); (iv) the morbidly obese (400,000); (v) those older
than six months of age with underlying diseases that affect the immune system (2 million); and (vi)
children from six months to five years of age (3.5 million).

                                                    4
             Component 2: Strengthening the Borrower’s health system response capacity
              to reduce the communicability of the influenza virus and improve medical
              care of those affected by influenza (US$217.2 million). The component
              financed the application of A/H1N1 and pneumococcal vaccines, provision of
              outpatient treatment to symptomatic populations with respiratory conditions and
              treatment of patients with a respiratory condition.
             Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring, and Technical Audits
              (US$1.6 million).

    1.6 Revised Components:

    12.         The components were not revised during implementation.

    1.7 Other significant changes

    13.         The Project had three level II restructurings:

    The first restructuring, approved on May 12, 2011, processed a partial cancellation
     of US$88 million in retroactive financing, reducing the financed amount to US$141
     million, and reallocating loan proceeds.

                                     the Wo ld Bank’s Ope ations P ocu ement Review
     Committee (OPRC),                                           . The restructuring reduced
     Category of disbursement 2 (goods) from US$181.8 million to US$82.8 million and
     increased Category 4 (outputs) from US$37.5 million to US$50.13 million.13
    The second restructuring, approved on March 19, 2012, supported the attainment
     of Project targets by (i) extending the closing date by 12 months from March 31,
     2012, to March 31, 2013, (ii) adjusting Project indicators, and (iii) reallocating loan
     proceeds.14 The following indicators were added to the results framework:

             The Borrower requested the introduction of more complex certification criteria for
              the HSR’s given that 19 out of 38 HSRs had in the first year of Project
              implementation achieved 100 percent accreditation according to key indicator 1
              criteria. Indicator 2 - Level II HSR accreditation was added to the results
              framework.



    13
       To finance a second A/H1N1 vaccination (the 2011 National Free Vaccination Campaign against
    Influenza).
    14
       The reallocation of loan proceeds (i) increased Category 1 disbursements (non consultancy and
    consultancy services) from US$1.8 to US$2.4 million in order to finance additional years of training
    activities, consolidate strengthening of the epidemiological surveillance system and extend the Independent
    Technical Audit (Auditoria Técnica Independiente - ITA); (ii) reduced Category 2 (goods) from US$82.8 to
    US$80.51 million to reflect activities already initiated in the 2011-2012 Procurement Plan; (iii) increased
    Category 3 (outputs) from US$4.9 to US$8.25 to provide an additional year of financing for the situation
    rooms (which would now receive a level II certification), and consolidate epidemiological surveillance
    system achievements; and (iv) reduced Category 4 (outputs) and Category 5 (operating costs).

                                                        5
              The following indicators were added once key indicators 4 and 5 had been
               achieved and the A/H1N1 and pneumococcal vaccines were incorporated into the
               National Vaccine alenda : “Dose of A/H1N1 vaccine included in National
               Calenda applied? (indicator 7) and “Dose of Pneumococcal vaccine included in
               National alenda applied? (indicator 8).

    The third restructuring, approved on March 1, 2013, extended for a second time
     the Project closing date from March 31, 2013 to December 31, 2013 to conclude
     Project activities. The extension provided additional time to complete the third and last
     independent certification for the Level II HSR accreditation and complete operational
     research activities at the provincial level, the epidemiology postgraduate course, and the
     purchase of ambulances.

    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

    14.        Project preparation and design were appropriately responsive to
    Government and health sector priorities. The Project responded to the GOA’s request
    for assistance in the monitoring, prevention and control of the A/H1N1 influenza
    pandemic. The Government demonstrated a high level of commitment to the Project with
    prompt preparation and processing of all steps necessary to ensure Project readiness. The
    World Bank’s active and productive engagement with the GOA and long experience with
    A gentina’s health sector led to close cooperation in Project design and to a fast response
    through an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL). An alternative instrument was not
    considered given the crisis nature of the situation and the fact that the Project met the
    criteria defined under emergency operations. Weaknesses in the results framework design
    slightly impacted the ability to evaluate Project achievements (See section 2.3).

    15.       Project design was based on a detailed sector analysis, in line with the
    GOA’s Federal Health Plan (FHP), an economic analysis and incorporated lessons
    learned from other operations and international experience. It also linked
    disbursements to the achievement of results (outputs), which has been shown to lead to
    improve performance and management.15 Project design relied on the existing Integral
    Plan for the Prevention of an Influenza Pandemic (Unidad de Coordinación General del
    Plan Integral para la Prevención de Pandemia de Influenza), developed jointly between
    the MSN and the Ministry of the Interior in 2007, adapted to existing health conditions
    and utilized in the implementation of GOA measures against the A/H1N1. An economic
    analysis conducted during preparation revealed that the benefit of strengthening epidemic
    mitigation capacity was greater than the (avoided) cost of an unmitigated A/H1N1
    epidemic wave.

2.2 Implementation

16.       Overall Project implementation was satisfactory. The Project had
satisfactory ratings throughout implementation and achieved four out of the five key
indicators and seven out of the remaining nine indicators. Of the three indicators that
were not achieved, one achieved 95 percent of its target, and two were not measured due
to pandemic control.

17.      The RBF mechanism facilitated relations between the MSN and the
provinces and enhanced performance incentives. The RBF mechanism was initiated
under the FESP and Provincial Maternal-Child Health Investment projects to improve the
functioning of the health system via incremental incentive-based payments. Since the
RBF mechanism provided funds above those earmarked in the provincial budget, it
generated an extra incentive for provincial and central government to comply with
Project requirements. Nine of the 14 indicators operated as result-based indicators
receiving disbursements once the results were achieved and certified by an Independent
Technical Audit (Auditoria Técnica Independiente).

18.        Project implementation benefitted from existing World Bank-financed
health sector projects and was executed using existing structures. The Project was
implemented by the MSN with the International Health Financing Unit (Unidad de
Financiamiento Internacional de Salud -- UFI-S) serving as coordinator of Project
activities. The signing of Performance Agreements formalized the engagement between
the MSN and 23 provincial governments for A/H1N1 Project implementation.
Implementation was facilitated by the use of FESP’s existing social and environmental
safeguard mechanisms.

19.      Problems in utilizing retroactive financing prevented the GOA from taking
advantage of the emergency instrument. In line with OP/BP 8.00, the Loan had
provisions to reimburse the GOA for up to 40 percent of the loan amount (US$91.6
million) for eligible expenditures incurred since the outbreak of the 2009 A/H1N1
influenza virus, as long as after April 30, 2009, under expedited World Bank procurement
procedures. The GOA obtained the first disbursement, an advance of US$90 million, on
April 26 2011, 12 days after Project effectiveness. Nevertheless, the World Bank did not
authorize the use of Project funds to retro-finance the vaccines purchased prior to Loan
Agreement signing (See Section 2.4 Procurement).

20.        The GOA successfully realigned the Project focus. With the denial of
retroactive financing for the purchased vaccines (that represented such a large loan
allocation), the GOA and the World Bank evaluated options for Project adjustments. As a
result, in addition to the cancellation of US$88 million, Project activities were revised,
and the public health intelligence system and the health network were strengthened
through the upgrading of equipment and mobile and urgency systems.




                                            7
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

21.       Design of the M&E framework was appropriate considering the relevance
and quality of indicators. Due to the difficulty in attributing outcomes in emergency
response projects for influenza outbreaks, the World Bank team responsible for Project
preparation decided to focus on intermediate outcomes to measure Project achievements.
The results framework did not formally differentiate between PDO-level indicators and
intermediate-level indicators. The five indicators defined in the PAD to measure Project
results were labeled as “key indicators? in this ICR. The P oject’s first sub-objective - to
prevent, monitor and evaluate influenza activity, was to be measured by two key
indicators: (i) HSRs certified (key indicator 1), and (ii) Operational MOCS implemented
(key indicator 3). The second sub-objective - to control epidemic waves of the A/H1N1
influenza, was measured by three key indicators: (i) dose of A/H1N1 vaccine applied
(key indicator 5), (ii) dose of Pneumococcal vaccine applied (key indicator 6), and (iii)
influenza diagnostic laboratory test carried out in 2010 and 2011 (key indicator 13).

22.        Despite some deficiencies, the M&E framework served to track progress
towards the achievement of Project PDO and was used as an important
management tool to inform decision making. The PAD’s esults f amewo k and
monitoring (Annex 2) had some inconsistencies regarding the roles and responsibilities
for collecting, reporting, and analyzing data for some of the indicators. Further, since
most Project indicators operated as result-based disbursements they were monitored by
two different verification sources (i) MSN (including Expanded Program on
Immunization (EPI) for vaccination and treatment, and the Laboratory Surveillance
System (Sistema de Vigilancia de Laboratorios – SIVILA) for the laboratory testing for
the achievement of targets), and (ii) the ITA for the verification of outputs for
disbursement purposes. Project indicators linked to disbursements included: (i) HSR
Certified (key indicator 1), (ii) operational MOCS implemented (key indicator 3),
operational MOCS for indigenous people implemented (indicator 4), (iv) dose of
A/H1N1 vaccine applied (key indicator 5), (v) dose of Pneumococcal vaccine applied
(key indicator 6), (vi) outpatient treatment provided (indicator 9), (vii) inpatient treatment
provided in hospitalization (indicator 10), (viii) inpatient treatment provided in ICU
(indicator 12), and (ix) influenza diagnostic laboratory test carried out in 2010 and 2011
(key indicator 13). The dichotomy was not an issue except for key indicator 2, for which
results differ by source – MSN or ITA. The World Bank and GOA teams used ITA as the
source of verification only for disbursement purposes.

23.       The certification and compliance validation of results strengthened the
MSN’s M&E capability at the national and provincial level. The Project financed
eight technical audits, which provided evidence for the reimbursement of expenses. Since
the Project was executed by different technical units at the provincial and national levels,
the know-how involved in providing the information requested by the auditors as well as
more general M&E knowledge was strengthened and sustained within each unit. This
was particularly true at the provincial level.




                                              8
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

24.       The Environmental Safeguard was triggered (OP4.01) as a result of the
increase in health care waste production due to the implementation of Component 2.
Environmental safeguards coincided with those within the FESP framework, generating
synergies between both Projects. The safeguard was based on environmental diagnostics
realized in Argentine hospitals via FESP, for the control of health care waste in health
establishments, including the disposal of vaccines. Medical waste management
demonstrated full compliance with environmental safeguard measures in participating
hospitals, including bio-safety regulation compliance, use of disposable supplies, bio-
contaminated product segregation, and use of approved medical waste containers.
Furthermore, the Project contributed to the development of a National Guide for the
management and disposal of vaccines and segregation of bio-contaminated products, and
supervised 30 provincial hospitals, surpassing the 21 hospitals initially considered,
proving a satisfactory outcome, as rated in the last Implementation Status and Results
Report (ISR).

25.       The Indigenous People (IP) Safeguard was triggered in 15 out of the 23
provinces in accordance with the Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). These provinces
already counted with IPPs, prepared in consultation with the Indigenous Participation
Council of the National Institute for Indigenous Affairs during FESP I Project
preparation.16 IPPs contained activities designed to make the delivery of Priority Public
Health Programs (PPHPs) more culturally relevant and sensitive. The Project
disseminated locally-appropriate materials and in some cases indigenous language
materials promoting vaccination against A/H1N1, and communication regarding self-care
and early symptoms detection via the Social Communication Modules. Achievement of
the IP safeguard was rated highly satisfactory in the last ISR.

26.       Financial Management (FM) arrangements in terms of accounting,
budgeting, flow of funds; internal control, external audit and financial reporting
were performed satisfactorily in accordance with the last ISR. Overall Project FM
ISR ratings ranged from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory during Project
implementation. The Project team had a constructive engagement with the World Bank
on FM aspects throughout implementation. FM advice was provided in a timely manner.
Minor FM shortcomings identified during supervision missions were properly addressed
by the Project team and FM agreed actions were fully complied with. As a result of this
effort, the quality and timeliness of the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) improved.
Financial statements audit reports were submitted to the World Bank with some delay;
were reviewed and found acceptable. The final audit report is expected to be submitted
on June 30, 2014. In addition to financial audits, the Project had independent technical
audits (ITA) carried out by the private firm "Bértora y Asociados", whose objective was
to audit the veracity and reliability of health intervention results linked to disbursements


16
  The Project teams worked closely with the Provinces to prepare the plans, including holding several
workshops and providing materials in the local languages. All Provinces with indigenous populations
except La Pampa prepared an IPP in 2008 in a participative approach involving social evaluations.

                                                 9
(outputs). ITA reports were reviewed whenever outputs were documented with IFR
submissions.

27.       In May 2012 an Independent Procurement Review was conducted, which
included a review of UFI-S capacity to handle procurement, and of a sample of
contracts. The findings showed significant efforts undertaken by the UFI-S to maintain
and comply with procurement regulations, good internal control mechanisms and
adequate procurement performance, while highlighting some procurement management
weaknesses. Despite risks and characteristics of the vaccine market included in the PAD,
the World Bank decided not to finance (retroactively) the purchase of vaccines because
the purchase process carried out by the GOA resulted in a single offer. According to the
Operations Procurement Review Committee (OPRC), the GOA should have used an
international competitive bidding (ICB) method to attract more suppliers and obtain the
best available market price. According to the GOA, the use of an ICB could have
compromised the ability of the country to obtain the necessary vaccines and/or to obtain
them in a timely manner. In addition, there was a Government's understanding that
supply conditions were limited due to the high demand for vaccines from USA and
European countries. Procurement delays emerged with the purchase of other goods
eligible under the Project, such as antiviral treatments (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir),
oximeters and ambulances.17

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

28.       The current administration continues to prioritize a reduction in acute
respiratory infections (ARI) and sustain the advances achieved in the A/H1N1
vaccination campaign. In 2011 the A/H1N1 vaccine for high-risk individuals and on
January 1, 2012 the pneumococcal vaccine for children under two years of age were
introduced into the National Calendar schedule. According to the National Program for
the Control of Inmunopreventable Diseases (Programa Nacional de Control de
Enfermedades Inmunoprevenibles -- PRONACEI) reports, A/H1N1 and pneumococcal
coverage remained high following Project completion, at 90 percent and 82.4 percent in
2013, respectively. The recent construction of an influenza vaccine plant in Buenos Aires
province will allow the country to produce and export seasonal and pandemic influenza
vaccines.

29.       The World Bank continues to have a strong presence in the Argentine
health sector. The Essential Public Health Functions and Programs II Project (FESP II,
Loan. 7412-AR, P110599), in the amount of US$ 461 million was approved by the Board
on December 20, 2010. The five-year project has two PDOs: (i) improve the stewardship
role of the federal public health system, through the strengthening of Essential Public
Health Functions (EPHFs), and (ii) increase the coverage and clinical governance of
priority public health programs (PPHPs). In addition to FESP II and Provincial Maternal-
Child Health Investment Project, the World Bank is currently assisting the GOA to


17
  Numerous procurement issues arose during the purchase of ambulances, which resulted in the rejection
of the first bidding process and a two-year purchase delay, which was finally successfully achieved.

                                                  10
prepare a project supporting the prevention and control of chronic conditions and
illnesses, which would reproduce the Project’s execution mechanism.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

30.       Project objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant. The
P oject’s objectives a e consistent with the GOA’s FHP 2011-2016 and with national
health system strengthening. The emphasis on surveillance and laboratory systems is
important since they provide crucial input on seasonal virus fluctuations and on possible
health epidemics.18

31.       The Project produced concrete strategic and operational advances in the
monitoring and control of the A/H1N1 flu epidemic in Argentina, transforming the
crisis into an opportunity and contributing significantly to improvements in public
health using a RBF approach. Currently, all hospitalized individuals have samples
taken (for clinical and epidemiological surveillance reasons), while random samples
taken in ambulatory centers serve for epidemiological surveillance purposes. Some of
these samples are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta, contributing to the formulation of the southe n hemisphe e’s flu vaccine. The use
of Argentine samples for the formulation of the vaccine has clear benefits for the
population since the vaccine will more closely resemble the virus strains circulating in
the country the prior year.

32.       Strengthening the GOA’s health pandemic preparedness is a building
block towards the establishment of a robust fiscal risk management strategy. In
addition to reducing morbidy and mortality, minimizing societal disruptions and therefore
economic costs are worthwhile objectives of vaccination strategies. 19 Support for
zoonotic disease control within a comprehensive pandemic preparedness plan would
bolster the risk management agenda, in particular due to the significant role of agriculture
in Argentina. This requires cooperation and coordination between animal and human
health sectors, both at the strategic level and during pandemic preparedness
implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

33.      In general, the Project was successful in achieving expected results. Four of
the five key indicators were achieved. The remaining indicator (key indicator 1) was

   Good surveillance mechanisms allow governments to efficiently invest and distribute health care
resources. Due to influenza virus variability, the capacity to evaluate data quickly provides the foundation
for an effective response.

largely achieved, with results substantially higher than the baseline and with the actual
level of accomplishment at 95 percent of the expected target. The following paragraphs
analyze efficacy of each of the Project sub-objectives.

34.      The Project’s efficacy was substantial in its objective to strengthen
Argentina’s epidemiological health surveillance system to prevent, monitor and
evaluate influenza activity. Achievement of sub-objective 1 was to be evaluated through
two key indicators, measuring the strengthening of epidemiological surveillance situation
rooms in every province (key indicator 1), and implementation of social communication
(MOCS) modules (key indicator 3). Although not included as part of the key indicators to
measure this first sub-objective, indicator 2 – Health Situation Rooms (Level II
accredited), is a natural continuation of key indicator 1 and even more complex, and as
such could also be taken into account for that purpose.

35.       By Project completion, 36 situation rooms in 22 national jurisdictions could
generate health information at the provincial and departmental level in a systemic
and timely manner. Health related decision-making was strengthened and systematized
by the situation rooms improved ability to collect and analyze information to describe
health status and prioritize health problems. 20 Surveillance capacity was strengthened
through the reinforcement of human and capital resources in the HSRs. During Project
implementation, it was decided to extend the certification process for two additional
years, and apply a more in depth and complex certification process in the third year to
promote institutionalization and improve the quality of generated information. Thirty-
seven of the 38 HSRs were certified in 2010 and 2011 and 36 in 2012 by an ITA, almost
achieving the target for key indicator 1.21 The HSR certification criteria was based on the
following: (i) institutional mechanisms for the integration and diffusion of information,
(ii) health quality improvements, (iii) improvements in the technical quality of the
analysis, and (iv) HSR functioning. The target for the Level II accreditation (indicator 2)
was surpassed, with 28 situation rooms (compared to a target of 16) reaching a very high
level of certification.22 Financing of the situation rooms was related with disbursements
and the annual certification process.

36.       Key indicator 3, implementation of the Operational Modules of Social
Communication, was achieved. The objective of the MOCS was to create local
communication campaigns that increased public influenza awareness, encouraged
prevention through vaccination, and promoted self-care against the transmission of
infectious diseases, by focusing on prevention measures for respiratory diseases, and


20
    The process includes registering, analyzing, and disseminating information on priority diseases,
including the gathering of statistics from clinics all over the country; promoting research on prevalent,
serious and preventable transmissible diseases; and analyzing, in an effective and timely manner, statistics
on disease p evalence and othe data, to monito the count y’s public health status.
21 The city of Buenos Aires did not join the Program, while the province of Formosa did not submit their
situation room for certification in 2012, as the new health authorities did not support their implementation.
22
   The indicator was only applied in year three of Project implementation and involved more complex
certification criteria, including the establishment of institutional mechanisms to integrate and diffuse
information and the quality improvement of provincial health information.

                                                    12
promotion of early doctor visits.23 Achievement of indicators was measured according to
MOCS reports approved by the MSN, although ITA validation was required for
disbursements. Ninety percent were implemented and approved by the MSN, and 83
percent were validated by ITA. Likewise, 90 percent of the 45 MOCS adapted for
indigenous populations were implemented (indicator 4), and 80 percent were validated by
ITA.24 A survey carried out in September 2011 to evaluate the experience of MOCS in
terms of vaccine prevention promotion and improvement of inter institutional relations
had positive results.25

37.      The Project’s efficacy was high in its capacity to strengthen the response
capacity of the health system to control epidemic waves of the A/H1N1 influenza.
This sub-objective was to be measured by three key indicators: Dose of A/H1N1 vaccine
applied (key indicator 5), dose of pneumococcal vaccine applied (key indicator 6) and
influenza diagnostic laboratory tests carried out in 2010 and 2011 (key indicator 13).
Achievement of this sub-objective was high as reflected in high vaccination coverage
rates and low mortality in 2010 and 2011. Coordination between the National
Government and the provinces for the control and prevention of influenza-like illnesses
                                                               was highly effective.
                                                               The infection rate for all
                                                               kinds of influenza was
                                                               49 percent lower in

influenza-like symptoms.26


38.      Key indicator 5, dose of A/H1N1 vaccine applied was achieved. The GOA
began the A/H1N1 vaccination campaign in February 2010, and 14 days before the
beginning of winter had reached 80 percent vaccination coverage. Coverage was aimed at


23
   One MOC per 72,000 inhabitants.
24
   Acording to Project design, each province with an IPP was to implement three MOCs, however three
provinces failed to elaborate them. Rio Negro decided that the indigenous population could be served with
the provincial MOCs, while La Pampa and Salta found it difficult to establish IPP MOCs due to the lack of
a communication unit within the provincial ministry of health.

those most at risk, and reached 93 percent and 108 percent coverage, respectively in 2010
and 2011, surpassing the 90 percent Project target for each year. This accounted for the
highest eligible population coverage rate in Latin America for the winter season. The
vaccination campaigns in 2010 and 2011 offered free vaccination in all hospitals and
vaccination centers to high-risk individuals.27 Though the GOA covered the cost of the
vaccines, the World Bank loan covered the costs associated with vaccine application,
with the latter transferring to the provinces a set amount per vaccine applied. Due to the
success of the vaccination campaign, the GOA decided to include the vaccine in the
national calendar vaccination schedule starting in 2011. Indicator 7, dose of A/H1N1
vaccine included in the national calendar applied, surpassed the established target (80
percent) in 2011 and 2012.

          Key indicator 6, dose of pneumococcal vaccine applied successfully reached
its target in 2011. Insufficient coverage in 2010 (36 percent coverage) likely resulted
from an initial focus on the influenza campaign due to the fear of a subsequent A/H1N1
wave, an initial overestimation of the target, lack of registration and notification by health
personnel of applied doses, and ambiguousness regarding the target population. Once
these factors were addressed, and information regarding applied doses was included in
the National Health Surveillance System (Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Salud -
SNVS), coverage climbed to 99.3 percent by 2011. Starting in January 2012, the vaccine
was introduced in the national calendar vaccination schedule for children less than two
years of age. Indicator 8, dose of pneumococcal vaccine included in the national calendar
applied surpassed the target (80 percent) in 2012.




41.      In addition to prevention of influenza, the Project sought to improve health
care in hospitals by financing the provision of antiviral treatments as well as
hospital equipment and other inputs. The targets for indicators 9 and 11 were
achieved. The target for indicator 9, outpatient treatment provided, was surpassed in both
2010 and 2011 as revealed in the SNVS. Over 100 percent of the registered cases of
influenza-type illnesses were treated in 2010, and 99 percent in 2011. In addition to
improving virus registration, this result also contributed to the strengthening and


27
   During the first restructuring, funds allocated to Category of disbursement 4 (outputs) were increased to
finance the 2011 National Free Vaccination Campaign against Influenza (second year) due to the successful
reduction of virus communicability from the 2010 campaign.

legitimization of the SNVS system. Indicator 11, inpatient treatment provided in hospital
due to ARI was achieved with 40,936 individuals receiving treatment (10,000 individuals
over the target).

3.3 Efficiency

42.       Project efficiency was substantial, with the social and economic benefits of
the Project outweighing the costs. Considering as a benefit the direct costs avoided
(costs associated with the pandemic and infected people) one obtains a net cost benefit of
US$ 535 million discounted at a rate of 3 percent and a reasonable cost benefit of 1.7. 28
However, the economic benefits of the adopted measures are likely underestimated by
not considering social distancing measure effects in key sectors of the economy and the
positive impact of reducing epidemic risks past the initial year.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

43.      The overall outcome rating is Satisfactory. The rating is based on the
following considerations: (i) objectives, design and implementation highly relevant to the
Argentine country context, (ii) substantial and high efficacy ratings in achieving intended
outcomes, as measured by both sub-objectives, and (iii) substantial efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

44.       The strengthening of the epidemiological system and health system’s
capacity to respond to emergencies as well as the implementation of social
communication campaigns likely benefitted the lower population deciles. The
experience of prior epidemics (such as the 1918 Spanish Flu) and the first wave of the
A/H1N1 in Argentina indicate that poverty-linked factors, such as the lack of basic
sanitation, poor access to health services, and reduced access to information, often enable
the spread and compound the severity of influenza infections. The Project addressed this
challenge by strengthening the epidemiological surveillance system to better target
interventions, improving the health system’s capacity to espond to eme gencies, and
implementing MOCS targeted toward the poorest populations.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

45.       The Project strengthened the long-term capacity and institutional
development of the Argentine MSN. Project execution through the different technical
units resulted in the buildup of in-house capability, which remained in the MSN after
Project completion. This is especially relevant in a country with a relatively stable human
resource capacity. The new Remediar and Redes Inter-American Development Bank-


28
 The costs may also be inflated as the costs of a second wave could have been lower than those of the first
wave.

                                                    15
financed Project is being executed utilizing the same framework. This framework not
only built up capacity but also facilitated relations between the provinces and the federal
Government since the interlocutors remained the same. A strengthening of the
communication departments within the p ovincial level MSN’s (as well as at the national
level) improved the credibility of the health sector in general.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

46.      One of the main risks to the development outcome regards the
sustainability of the situation rooms. Approximately half the HSRs have an official
document or administrative act that establishes their institutional jurisdiction, activities
and structure. Though the HSRs will receive financing through the FESP II Project until
2015, their sustainability and institutionalization depends on their continued use and
transformation into a strategic tool for the management of health decisions. A number of
provinces had established situation rooms previously, however incentives to sustain the
rooms diminished once national level financing was discontinued.29

47.      Sustaining high influenza vaccination coverage rates remains a risk to the
Development Outcome. Though Argentina maintains high coverage rates and the
population generally views vaccination as a right and a responsibility, the demand for the
Influenza vaccine may wane as the fear of another pandemic decreases. The inclusion of
the A/H1N1 vaccine for high-risk groups and pneumococcal vaccine for children into the
National Vaccine Calendar mitigates this risk.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

48.       World Bank performance on ensuring Quality of Entry is rated
Satisfactory. The World Bank responded swiftly within a three month Project
preparation period. As noted in Section 2.1, Project design was based on a detailed sector
analysis in line with the GOA’s FHP and the PS, incorporated lessons learned from
other operations and international experience, and introduced several innovative
approaches. In addition, an economic analysis conducted during preparation showed that


29
     Some provinces, such as Santa Fe and Tucuman did maintain room functioning.

                                                    16
Project benefits exceeded costs of a possible second wave. Despite some deficiencies in
the Project M&E framework, it was overall well designed, and allowed for the
measurement of Project results. It focused on intermediate outcomes considering the
inherent evaluation challenges for Influenza type epidemics, as recently recommended by
the World Bank Report on Controlling Avian Influenza.30

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.        The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. In addition to
engaging in seven missions, the supervision team engaged in numerous video and audio
discussions with the Project coordination unit and MSN officials over the Project life.
The team was particularly helpful in accompanying the MSN staff in documentation
provision and mechanisms required for the successful execution of the result-based
financing aspect of the Project (information needed for the audits). The fact that some of
the technical staff was based in Argentina greatly enhanced dialogue, and allowed for
continuous coordination and swifter problem resolution. However, procurement
difficulties did not support the use of the emergency instrument. In addition, deficiencies
in the results framework could have been addressed and recorded during the Project
restructuring processes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.      Given the Satisfactory Bank performance at Quality at Entry and the
Moderately Satisfactory performance during Project supervision, the overall rating for
Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

51.      Government performance is rated Satisfactory. The Ministry of Economy
and Public Finance gave its full support to the Project. The GOA moved forward with the
World Bank during Project preparation and allocated funds to purchase the A/H1N1
vaccines. Strong government commitment, experience with World Bank-financed
projects and existing technical MSN capability supported the achievement of Project
objectives despite the cancellation of the retroactive portion of the loan.

52.       Performance of the implementation Agency is rated Satisfactory. The MSN
was the P oject’s implementing agency. The UFI-S was responsible for general Project
coordination, including fiduciary aspects, component implementation and M&E. Since
the beginning of the Project, the MSN showed strong leadership and ownership of Project
objectives. UFI-S effective coordination between the different MSN areas and programs
and between national and provincial programs was a key element for the success of the
Project. Project implementation was executed through the different technical units within
the MSN, representing a new modus-operandi, which served to build up in-house
capabilities. Despite a steep learning curve in some areas, which resulted in technical
audit delays at the beginning of Project implementation, the different execution units
successfully supported Project implementation and PDO achievement. Although the
Project was designed in an emergency context, it shifted focus toward surveillance
system strengthening through three restructuring processes and, in practice, became a
regular operation. The Project closing date was extended twice to conclude activities that
were not included in the PAD, but inserted during the first two restructurings.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

53.       Given the mino sho tcomings obse ved in the Bo owe ’s pe fo mance, its
overall Performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

54.       Argentina’s adoption of a high-risk targeted vaccination strategy against
A/H1N1 influenza was effective in containing the epidemic. Assessments on the
effects of potential vaccination strategies against pandemic influenza in terms of reducing
morbidity and mortality based on priority age groups, transmissibility, timing of
vaccination efforts, and number of years of life lost have shown that even limited vaccine
supplies, if used optimally, can have an impact on mitigating disease burden in middle-
income countries (G. Chowell, C. Vibourd, X Wang, S Bertozzi and M. Miller).

55.       A comprehensive (human and animal) pandemic preparedness plan would
benefit from moving from a response approach using emergency instruments to one
that favors preventive risk reduction and risk management through regular country
program and operations. This would incorporate some of the objectives supported in
the World Bank-financed avian flu portfolio, which generally ran into a number of
obstacles due to the complicated inter-sectoral collaboration between health and
agriculture. Pandemic risk reduction is even in more need of global donor support than
natural disaster risk reduction, as pandemic preparedness in one country provides positive
spillovers to other while the benefits of disaster risk reduction are primarily local.

56.       High-risk groups can only be reached through an intense communication
effort. A well-developed communication strategy in the country had a positive impact on
social and behavior change, specifically among high risk population such as health
workers, pregnant women, young children, etc.

                                            18
57.        Despite a short preparation period, it is important to avoid having tunnel
vision and think broadly when designing emergency loans. Though the Project
focused on A/H1N1, it se ved to build up A gentina’s long-term preparedness and
capacity to confront any epidemic, not just A/H1N1. The strengthening of surveillance
and laboratory systems, as well as health networks are often overlooked in favor of other
priorities, however they are important components of national health systems.

58.       The execution of projects within existing technical/administrative
structures has significant positive externalities. The mechanism not only built in-house
sustainable capacity but also fostered greater cooperation among different health units
and broke the vertical implementation framework often resulting from the establishment
of stand-alone project coordinating units for externally funded projects.

59.       A RBF model is a valuable strategy to influence subnational government
policies in federal systems. The effective implementation of the RBF financing scheme
in Argentina enabled a successful reorientation of health care policies, as well as
enhanced management capacity at the national and provincial level. The framework
allowed the Federal Government to influence subnational policy while building up skills
of provincial counterparts. Incremental financing incentives, even if they are small can be
very powerful. Financing incentives as a startup measure have proven to contribute to the
willingness to comply. On the other hand, the excessive costs involved with continuous
audits raise the need to explore alternative auditing mechanisms.

60.       The World Bank should re-evaluate the objective of the emergency
recovery loan instrument and its consistency with other fiduciary policies. Even
though OP/BP 8.0 operational guiding principles have been developed bearing in mind
the need for a fast response, simplicity and flexibility in emergency situations, the policy
is not fully aligned with other fiduciary policies and guidelines, such as procurement.
Therefore, policies may benefit from reassessment in terms of their compatibility; and
task teams will benefit from more explicit guidance on the application of emergency
policies, especially when dealing with health emergencies. A previously streamlined or
pre-approved set of guidelines for emergency situations or less rigid procurement rules
for emergency situations could help borrowers and World Bank staff obtain a better
notion about World Bank retroactive financing options.

1.        In general, the Project was successful in achieving expected results. Four of
the five key indicators were achieved. The remaining indicator (indicator 1) was largely
achieved, with results substantially higher than the baseline and with the actual level of
accomplishment 95 percent of the expected target. The following paragraphs analyze
efficacy of each of the Project sub-objectives.

2.        The Project’s efficacy was substantial in its objective to strengthen
Argentina’s epidemiological health surveillance system to prevent, monitor and
evaluate influenza activity. Achievement of sub-objective 1 was to be evaluated through
two key indicators, measuring the strengthening of epidemiological surveillance situation
rooms in every province (key indicator 1), and implementation of social communication
(MOCS) modules (key indicator 3). Although not included as part of the key indicators to
measure this first sub-objective, indicator 2 – Health Situation Rooms – Level II
accredited, is a natural continuation of indicator 1 and since even more complex should
also be taken into account for that purpose.

3.         By Project completion, 36 situation rooms in 22 national jurisdictions could
generate health information at the provincial and departmental level in a systemic
and timely manner. Health related decision-making was strengthened and systematized
by the situation rooms improved ability to collect and analyze information to describe
existing health situations and prioritize health problems. 32 Surveillance capacity was
strengthened through the reinforcement of human and capital resources in the HSRs.
During Project implementation it was decided to extend the certification process for two
additional years, and apply a more in depth and complex certification process in the third
year to promote institutionalization and improve the quality of generated information.
Thirty-seven of the 38 HSRs were certified in 2010 and 2011 and 36 in 2012 by an ITA,
practically achieving the target (95 percent achieved) for key indicator 1. 33 The HSR
certification criteria were based on the following: (i) institutional mechanisms for the
integration and diffusion of information, (ii) health quality improvements, (iii)
improvements in the technical quality of the analysis, and (iv) HSR functioning. The
target for the Level II accreditation (indicator 2) was surpassed, with 28 situation rooms
(compared to a target of 16) reaching a very high level of certification.34 Financing of the
situation rooms was related with disbursements and the annual certification process.

4.        The Project supported the reinforcement of human and capital resources
in the HSRs to strengthen surveillance capacity. Each situation room contracted a
minimum of two epidemiologists and an assistant, installed an internet connection, and
covered office costs and a training module specialized for the hired personnel. A shortage
of epidemiologists, led the Project to finance a postgraduate course at the University of
Cordoba specializing in epidemiology for more than 200 professionals in two cohorts,
which were then staffed in the situation rooms or employed in the national and provincial
Epidemiology offices. An evaluation of the first cohort found that most students were
satisfied with the course. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed stated that their
expectations had been met, while 24 percent stated that their expectations had been


32
    The process includes registering, analyzing, and disseminating information on priority diseases,
including the gathering of statistics from clinics all over the country; promoting research on prevalent,
serious and preventable transmissible diseases; and analyzing, in an effective and timely manner, statistics
on disease p evalence and othe data, to monito the count y’s public health status.
33 The city of Buenos Aires did not join the Program, while the province of Formosa did not submit their
situation room for certification in 2012, as the new health authorities did not support their implementation.
34
   The indicator was only applied in year three of Project implementation and involved more complex
certification criteria, including the establishment of institutional mechanisms to integrate and diffuse
information and the improvement of health information quality in the provinces.

                                                     22
surpassed. The component financed workshops and training events for the strengthening
of epidemiological vigilance, and completed a number of studies tied to A/H1N1.

5.         Key indicator 3, implementation of the Operational Modules of Social
Communication, was achieved. The objective of the MOCS was to create local
communication campaigns that increased public awareness of influenza, encouraged
prevention through vaccination, and promoted self-care against the transmission of
infectious diseases, by focusing on prevention measures for respiratory diseases, and
promotion of early doctor visits. 35 The MOCS designed, produced and disseminated
audiovisual and graphic materials, to run integrated local culturally appropriate
communication campaigns. Indicator achievement for evaluation purposes was measured
according to reports on MOCS activities approved by the MSN, however ITA validation
was needed to receive outcome disbursements. Ninety percent were implemented and
approved by the MSN, and 83 percent were validated by ITA. Likewise, 90 percent of the
45 MOCS adapted for indigenous populations were implemented (indicator 4), and 80
percent were validated by ITA.36 A survey carried out in September 2011 to evaluate the
experience of MOCS in terms of vaccine prevention promotion and improvement of inter
institutional relations had positive results.37

                                                     6.         The Project’s efficacy was
                                                     high in its capacity to strengthen
                                                     the response capacity of the health
                                                     system to control a second A/H1N1
                                                     wave. This sub-objective was
                                                     measured by three key indicators:
                                                     dose of A/H1N1 vaccine applied (key
                                                     indicator 5), dose of pneumococcal
                                                     vaccine applied (key indicator 6) and
                                                     influenza diagnostic laboratory tests
                                                     carried out in 2010 and 2011 (key
indicator 13). Achievement of the sub-objective was substantial as reflected in high
coverage levels and low mortality in 2010 and 2011. Coordination between the National
Government and the provinces for the control and prevention of influenza-like illnesses
was highly effective. The infection rate for all kinds of influenza was 49 percent lower in
2010 than in the same period in 2009, with only two deaths being attributed to A/H1N1
(neither a high-risk individual). Graph 1 displays the difference between 2009 and 2010
in weekly cases of individuals with Influenza-like symptoms.38

   One MOC per 72,000 inhabitants.
36
   Acording to Project design, each province with an IPP was to implement 3 MOCs, however three
provinces failed to elaborate them. Rio Negro decided that the indigenous population could be served with
the provincial MOCs, while La Pampa and Salta found it difficult to establish IPP MOCs due to the lack of
a communication unit within the provincial ministry of health.

7.         Key indicator 5, dose of A/H1N1 vaccine applied was achieved. The GOA
began the A/H1N1 vaccination campaign in February 2010 and 14 days before the
beginning of winter had reached 80 percent coverage. Coverage was aimed at those most
at risk, and reached 93 percent and 108 percent coverage, respectively in 2010 and 2011,
surpassing the 90 percent Project target. 39 Though the MSN covered the cost of the
vaccines, the World Bank loan covered the costs associated with vaccine injection, with
the latter transferring to the provinces a set amount per vaccine applied. During the first
restructuring, funds allocated to category 4 (outputs) were increased to finance a second
complimentary vaccination, namely the 2011 National Free Vaccination Campaign
against Influenza. This Campaign was a result of the positive impact on reducing virus
communicability of the 2010 campaign, and with the objective of guaranteeing free
vaccination and maximum coverage in the whole country for the defined risk population
groups. The Campaign also allowed the ministry to provide ambulatory attention to
patients with symptoms compatible with Influenza. Indicator 7, dose of A/H1N1 vaccine
included in the national calendar applied, surpassed the established target (80 percent) in
2011 and 2012.

8.       Positive externalities attributable to public health-related investments
benefitted the whole population. Vaccination of those most susceptible and vulnerable
to the A/H1N1 virus reduced both mortality and communicability, while the reduction in
transmission had national as well as international benefits. Lastly, by strengthening the
Gove nment’s capacity and capability to conf ont an influenza epidemic, the Project built
the GOA’s capability to monitor and respond to a host of health priorities.

9.        Key indicator 6, dose of pneumococcal vaccine applied successfully reached
its target in 2011. Insufficient coverage in 2010 (36 percent coverage) likely resulted
from an initial focus on the influenza campaign due to the fear of a subsequent A/H1N1
wave, an overestimation of the target, lack of registration and notification by health
personnel of applied doses, and ambiguousness regarding the target population. Once
these factors were addressed, and information regarding applied doses was included in
the SNVS, coverage climbed to 99.3 percent by 2011. Starting in January 2012, the
vaccine was introduced in the national calendar vaccination schedule for children less
than two years of age. Indicator 8, dose of pneumococcal vaccine included in the national
calendar applied surpassed the target (80 percent) in 2012.




39
  This accounts for the highest coverage rate of the eligible population in the Latin America Region for the
winter season. The vaccination campaigns in 2010 and 2011 offered free vaccination in all hospitals and
vaccination centers to high risk individuals.

                                                    24
PRONACEI identified the following achievements from the 2010 and 2011 vaccination
campaigns:
        (i)    Adequate local demand for the vaccine
        (ii)   Coordinated and harmonized message by the relevant actors
        (iii) Effective and safe vaccine
        (iv)   Distribution of technical norms before the campaign
        (v)    Adequate marketing diffusion
        (vi)   Improvement in the registration of doses applied in the SNVS
        (vii) Introduction of the flu vaccine into the National Vaccination Calendar
        (viii) Execution of training workshops in the provinces

10.       Key indicator 13, influenza diagnostic laboratory tests carried out in 2010
and 2011, was surpassed. Su veillance of ARI’s via labo ato y tests p ovides
information regarding the frequency and distribution of the main respiratory viruses, the
virus subtypes and characteristics of the affected population to adopt prevention measures
and policies to control and manage public health. Sixty-five thousand three hundred and
forty one laboratory tests were performed in 2010 and 2011 surpassing the 54,000 target.
The number of influenza samples analyzed also increased annually, with an 11.53 percent
increase with respect to the average in 2010-2012. In 2013 all the provinces submitted
samples for respiratory viruses, with 111 laboratories providing samples of hospitalized
patients and 45 of ambulatory patients

11.        In addition to prevention, the Project sought to improve attention in
hospitals by financing the provision of antiviral treatments and the realization of
laboratory tests, as well as the provision of inputs and hospital equipment. The
targets for indicators 9 and 11 were achieved. The target for indicator 9, outpatient
treatment provided, was surpassed in both 2010 and 2011 as revealed in the SNVS. Over
100 percent of the registered cases of Influenza-type illnesses were treated in 2010, and
99 percent in 2011. In addition to improving virus registration, this result also contributed
to the strengthening and legitimization of the SNVS system. Intermediate health outcome
indicator 11, inpatient treatment provided in hospital due to ARI, was achieved with
40,936 individuals receiving treatment (10,000 individuals over the target).

12.       The purchase of medical equipment strengthened Argentina’s health care
network. In an effort to strengthen the quality of care and health network, 608 beds
(37.33 percent of those available) were equipped with a multi-parametric monitor, while
164 ambulances were purchased, providing an important tool to reduce mortality,
improve rapid attention and increase social inclusion. An additional 46 provincial
neonatal ambulances improve the timely attention for neonates while they are transferred
to hospitals, which in turn will likely reduce infant mortality, especially for those which
travel long distances to specialized hospitals. The Project also contributed to the
strengthening of epidemiological vigilance through the purchase and distribution of IT
equipment intended for the SNVS.

13.       Project management was strengthened through the use of existing
management units within the MSN at the national and provincial level for Project
execution. The use of existing units instead of the establishment of a Project coordinating
unit meant that capacity was built within each unit and remained their once the Project
was completed. This was particularly true for the improvement of monitoring capacities
required for the output-linked ITA’s. Further, the RBF mechanism raised the provinces
incentive to comply with Project requirements and strengthened the ability of the national
Government to influence provincial health policy.

1.     The present annex exhibits the results of the economic evaluation of the
Project using information provided by the MSN on the impact of health measures
against the A/H1N1 Influenza virus. The analysis takes into account not just the health
measures financed by the Project but also the entirety of health measures implemented by
the MSN to combat A/H1N1.

2.      In Argentina the Influenza A/H1N1 pandemic had a high impact in terms of
morbidity and mortality. The peak of the transmission occurred between
epidemiological week 25 and 26 throughout the country. According to SNVS in 2009
there were 1,590,660 cases of Influenza type illness (Enfermedad tipo influenza – ETI).
In 2010 there were 1,321,248 registered cases of ETI with a peak of 51,337 registered
cases in week 33. Figure 1 reveals the evolution of ETI cases in 2009 y 2010. In 2009
14,160 cases required hospitalization for ARI cases, representing a hospitalization rate of
34.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The age groups most affected were those under 5
years old and between 45 and 64 years of age. Confirmed deaths by influenza in the
period of major circulation were 626, throughout the 21 provinces. The age group with
the highest morality rate was the 50 a 59 year olds.

3.      The surveillance system likely underestimated the real health impact of the
epidemic. As a result and due to data revealed through the SNVS, MSN estimates a
larger number of symptomatic cases of influenza A/H1N1, severe acute respiratory
infections and deaths as exhibited in Table 2.

         Table 2: Revised Health Impact of Influenza A/H1N1 in Argentina

4.      The deaths due to influenza A/H1N1 resulted in a loss of 44,265 years of life
in 2009 and 1,115 years in 2010 and in terms of burden of disease 52,529 y 114 years
lost for 2009 and 2010, respectively.

5.      In addition to the loss of life and burden of disease, the epidemic resulted in a
substantial increase in demand for health services in particular in the first level of
attention. During the peak of the pandemic the health system was over exerted due to the
increase in demand for services, in particular in the metropolitan zones where the viral
circulation was superior (Raffo, 2011). This resulted in an excess burden on emergency
and hospitalization sectors, with a deficit for beds, in particular in intensive care units,
and delays and suspensions of programed surgeries. In addition the pandemic generated
significant economic losses due to labor and school absenteeism and the fall in demand
caused by the social distancing measures adopted, in particular the observed fall in
tourism, purchases in commercial centers and tickets for sporting and cultural events.

Cost and economic impact of the pandemic

6.      The measures adopted to combat the influenza A (H1N1) had a direct health
cost of US$628 million, including prevention costs (25 percent) and treatment costs
(75 percent).

7.      The economic impact was substantial though difficult to measure. 40 In the
case of Argentina, the MSN estimated the impact of the pandemic at US$2.1 billion, of
which 30 percent (US$628 million) correspond to the main health costs to address the
emergency and 70 percent to economic losses attributable to the illness (US$1.5 billion).
Productivity losses are associated with the days of work or school lost for people who
were directly affected by the illness, the years of life lost due to premature death and
disability and the economic impact of social distancing measures (closing of schools and
work absenteeism). If one considers the reduction in consumption caused by the
pandemic in sectors like tourism, transportation and recreation, the global cost of
influenza was over US$3 billion.

8.     Finally this section reviews some of the economic indicators to analyze the
efficacy of the health measures adopted by the GOA to combat Influenza A/H1N1,
and in particular evaluate the efficiency of the interventions that were supported
within the framework of the Project. The analysis considered two basic indicators: the
net benefit cost and the benefit cost ratio. For the analysis we considered as benefit of all
the public health interventions implemented the direct costs avoided (health costs due to
the pandemic and costs associated due to the presence of disease in infected individuals)
and as costs of the interventions the costs related to social distancing measures and
prevention implemented during the emergency.

9.      As exhibited in Table 4 the benefits calculated with a discount rate of 3
percent increase to US$1.3billion and the NPV at US$797 million. The net benefit
cost discounted at a rate of 3 percent reaches US$534 million and the benefit cost ratio to
1.7.

  In Mexico, for example, estimates indicate an economic impact of USD$9.1 billion, approximately 1
percent of GDP.

10.     Taking into account that economic benefits of the adopted measures to
combat the pandemic are underestimated due to the lack of consideration of the
effects of social distancing measures in key sectors of the economy, the net benefit
could be much higher.

11.     Based on the analysis and on the epidemiological data, the adopted measures
against the A/H1N1 and in particular the interventions that were financed via the
Project have been effective (epidemiologic impact) and efficient (economic impact)
in that they interrupted the pandemic at a reasonable cost.

INTRODUCTION

1.     The purpose of this Closing and Results Report is to consolidate the most
important information regarding the performance of the Emergency Project for the
Prevention, Surveillance and Control of A/H1N1 Influenza Type Illnesses , indicating
the primary actions carried out in the various project areas and the results achieved in
terms of compliance with the objectives proposed in the project design.

CHAPTER 1: Description of the initial situation and the context in which the
Project was formulated

1.1 Background

2.      In 2009 the epidemic generated by the A/H1N1 virus caused in Argentina 14,000
cases of hospitalization due to severe Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and more than
600 deaths throughout the country. In that same year, scientific and epidemiological
studies predicted another wave of influenza caused by the A/H1N1 virus, expected to
affect the Southern Cone in 2010. Consequently, the Government of Argentina (GOA)
requested a loan from the World Bank to help finance the costs associated with the efforts
made by national authorities to prevent, monitor and control the A/H1N1 influenza
epidemic, preparing an Emergency operation project under OP/BP 8.00.

3.     The p oject was app oved by the Wo ld Bank’s Boa d of Di ecto s on Feb ua y
21, 2010, and became effective in April 2010. Nevertheless, the GOA initiated the
planned actions in the originally-estimated time periods. In particular the vaccination
campaign was initiated in late February 2010. This meant that the process of acquiring
pandemic vaccines was carried out under national regulations, and acknowledgement of
the process by the World Bank would be requested later.

4.     With the project, the GOA was seeking—in addition to controlling a potential
new pandemic wave—to st engthen the count y’s ove all epidemiological esponse
system, and carry out actions for improving the surveillance system and contributing to
the improvement of the network of hospitals for symptomatic patients throughout the
country.

1.2 Health emergency setting (2009)

5.      In April 2009, after the outbreak of the new A/H1N1 Influenza in Mexico, the
vi us sp ead apidly to othe count ies. On June 11, 2009 the WHO’s decla ation of Phase
6 of the Pandemic Alert for A/H1N1 Influenza indicated that a world pandemic was in
progress, and that it was necessary to move from preparations to response.

6.      In Argentina the peak of contagion took place between June 20 and July 3, with
the virus circulating throughout the entire country. By December 4 the number of deaths
had reached 613, above the number for Mexico, with Argentina ranking third among
countries around the world at that time.

                                           36
7.     The number of cases of ILI (influenza-like illness) reported during 2009 was
much higher than during previous epidemic years, reaching a level of 160,000 cases
reported per week at the peak of viral circulation.

8.     As for serious cases, a total of 14,160 cases requiring hospitalization due to severe
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) were reported during 2009, representing a
hospitalization rate of 34.95 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

9.      The age groups most seriously affected were children under five years of age,
with a rate of 76.41 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by the group of persons 45 to
64 years of age, with a rate of 26 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

10.     During 2009, 12,080 cases of Pandemic Influenza (H1N1) were confirmed by
laboratory tests. The 2009 Pandemic Influenza (H1N1) and unspecified Influenza A
represented 83.3% of the total respiratory viruses reported in patients fives year of age or
older, and 22.13% in children under the age of five.41 In 2009 there were 626 confirmed
patient deaths from the pandemic influenza, during the period of the greatest circulation.

1.3 GOA’s intervention strategy

11.     Argentina responded to the emergency by following the Integrated Response Plan
fo the Influenza Pandemic and “SARS,? app oved by Dec ee 644/2007. The Project was
formulated in this context, with an immediate objective—controlling the pandemic—and
another objective structural in nature—the comprehensive strengthening of the Argentine
health system’s capacity fo esponding to potential epidemiological outb eaks.

12.     Argentina was the first country in the region (in the Southern hemisphere) to
begin an anti-influenza vaccination campaign, implementing a comprehensive
vaccination strategy that also included the pneumococcal and pertussis vaccines. The
2010 and 2011 vaccination campaigns were on a massive scale, offered free-of-charge in
all of the count y’s hospitals and vaccination cente s fo the at-risk population.42 Based
on a decision by the GOA, the anti-flu vaccine was incorporated into the National
Vaccination Calendar for the at-risk population during the second half of 2011.

CHAPTER 2: Results Achieved in the H1N1 Emergency Project and the
Contribution to Strengthening Prioritized Actions

13.      In the following sections, the P oject’s cont ibutions and esults a e desc ibed in
detail, by components, outputs, indicators and related actions.

  Mothers of infants under 6 months of age, children from 6 to 24 months of age, pregnant women, post-partum
women, health personnel, persons over 65 years of age, persons with chronic illnesses (respiratory, cardiac, renal,
diabetic, weakened immunity and morbidly obese).

                                                       37
2.1 Component 1: Strengthening epidemiological surveillance for preventing,
monitoring and evaluating influenza activity

14.     With the objectives of expanding and improving the quality of the
epidemiological surveillance system for timely detection of cases of respiratory illnesses,
and promoting prevention and self-care measures, this component included the following
actions:

2.1.1. Provincial Health Situation Rooms

The project proposed the implementation of Health Situation Rooms (HSRs) throughout
the country, under Output 1 of Component 1. The objective was to implement 38 HSRs
(during a two-year period). 43 At the p ojects’ end, 36 Health Situation Rooms a e
operating throughout the country. 44 The implementation and strengthening of the
provincial Health Situation Rooms, with human, physical and technological resources
associated with their operations, and with a coordinated protocol for completing tasks,
supervised by a national technical team, generated a platform for producing systematic,
periodic information. This led to improved contributions from the provinces to the
National Health Surveillance System (SNVS) and promoted the assimilation of the
Rooms by provincial health authorities, as an instrument for improvements in managing
and making health decisions.

15.    Of the 36 Rooms, 28 certified their activities in 2012 above 80% compliance with
the certification protocol, indicating an optimal level of functioning. 45 During the last
year of certification (2012), the evaluation was particularly oriented toward the
production of high-quality information in a systematic, timely manner, through
contributions from the various areas, programs and projects. This generates mechanisms
for flows of information centralized in the Room, which also offers and produces
information for provincial health authorities.


2.1.1.1 Degree of the Rooms’ institutionalization

16.  The degree of institutionalization in the HSRs at the end of the project can be
summarized as follows: 33% of the provincial HSRs are formally established within the



43
   One room for each of 20 provinces (Catamarca, Chaco, Chubut, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa,
La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, Neuquén, Río Negro, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz, Santiago del Estero, Tierra
del Fuego and Tucumán); two rooms for Córdoba (Córdoba Capital and Río Cuarto) and Santa Fe (Santa Fe Capital
and Rosario); one room for the city of Buenos Aires; 13 rooms for the Buenos Aires province (12 for the Health
Regions and one central provincial room).
44 The city of Buenos Aires did not participate in the project, and the Formosa room did not certify its operations
during 2012.
45
   Buenos Aires, 10 Rooms (Central, RS 1, RS II, RS IV, RS V, RS VI, RS VII, RS IX, RS XI, RS XII); Chaco, 1
Room; Chubut, 1 Room; Córdoba, 2 Rooms (Capital and Río Cuarto); Entre Ríos, 1 Room; La Pampa, 1 Room; La
Rioja, 1 Room; Misiones, 1 Room; Neuquén, 1 Room; Río Negro, 1 Room; Salta, 1 Room; San Juan, 1 Room; San
Luis, 1 Room; Santa Cruz, 1 Room; Santa Fe, 2 Rooms (Capital and Rosario), Santiago del Estero, 1 Room; and
Tucumán, 1 Room.

                                                       38
scheme of the Ministries of Health at the provincial level; 57% of the provincial HSRs
are still in the process of becoming formalized; and 10% of the HSRs have not presented
initiatives for their integral formalization.

2.1.1.2 Financing for Human Resources

17.    The work carried out in the provincial Situation Rooms and coordinated at the
national level was possible due to financing for the hiring of Human Resources. A small
g oup of consultants in the Epidemiology Depa tment in A gentina’s Minist y of Health
(MSAL) was hi ed acco ding to stipulations in the P oject’s Ope ations Manual, through
a competition among groups of three, as was an extensive group of consultants from the
provincial Situation Rooms, using the ROSTER method.

18.     Three consultants, specifically two experts in epidemiology and one with a public
health orientation were hired for the Epidemiology Department at MSAL. They became
pa t of the National HSR technical team du ing the P oject’s enti e execution. The team’s
performance, in terms of complying with all of the actions required for implementing the
provincial Rooms, was excellent.

19.     A fundamental facto in stimulating the Situation Rooms’ wo k was the
establishment of an interdisciplinary technical team with the capacity to obtain data from
various sources and provide tools for not only bringing together quantitative and
qualitative methodologies but also different perspectives.46


2.1.1.3 Training

20.     Financing was provided for training activities ranging from graduate studies, to
practical-theoretical courses, to workshops on specific topics related to processing health
information. Training was provided to over 200 professionals with the Graduate Course
in Epidemiology given by the National University of Córdoba.

2.1.1.4 Publications

21.     Two publications were produced in the framework of the implementation of
Situation Rooms, and they we e dist ibuted to health depa tments in all of the count y’s
p ovinces: (i) “Salas de Situación de Salud en Argentina: Compartiendo el proceso de
implementación?, a p esentation of all the st ategic plans fo implementing HSRs in the
23 provincial jurisdictions, for the particular context in each province and (ii)



46
   The required profile was the following: a university-educated professional with abilities in developing cross-cutting
epidemiological studies. Profiles with the required skills: health sciences (physicians, nutritionists, psychologists,
biochemists, kinesiologists, obstetricians, odontologists, pharmacists, and university graduates in nursing or other
health sciences), social sciences and humanities, statistics, social communication, social service, administration, health
administration, as well as biological, natural and veterinary sciences; preferably with training in health and experience
in epidemiological surveillance.

“Experiencias Exitosas de Salas de Situación de Salud en Argentina?, a compilation of
experiences in the Rooms in the Mendoza, Neuquén, Santa Fe and Tucumán provinces.

2.1.1.5 Computer Equipment

22.    The project also contributed to strengthening the epidemiological surveillance
system through the purchase and distribution of computer equipment for the nodes in the
National Health Surveillance System (Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Salud—
SNVS). This system operates by promoting the flow of information for improving the
coverage and quality of surveillance data that begins at the local level and expands to the
provinces and the national government.

2.1.2 Communication campaigns for prevention and self-care

23.      The project financed the Operational Modules of Social Communication
(MOCS), with the objectives of promoting the dissemination of measures for preventing
the spreading of respiratory illness, promoting early doctor visits, and adapting social
communication policies to native communities, through communication campaigns
directed at local communities. The MOCS directed at the indigenous population
facilitated a synergy of actions with the IPP in the FESP Project, through the promotion
of actions aimed at coordination with indigenous health agents (workshops, groups,
conferences, meetings, etc.) The experience of systematizing the MOCS was considered
by MSAL’s ommunications Depa tment as an expe ience to be eplicated in other
programs.

2.2 Component 2: Strengthening the Argentine health system’s response capacity
for reducing the virus’ transmissibility.

2.2.1 Reducing the virus’ transmissibility

24.     In Argentina, the primary reason for doctor visits and inpatient services at all ages
is respiratory illness. Based on the data from the National Health Surveillance System (in
the clinic and laboratory surveillance modalities) and from the National Reference
Laboratory for Influenza and other respiratory viruses, the situation for the Influenza-
Type Illness (ITI) is analyzed, together with the studied cases of respiratory viruses.

2.2.1.1. Anti-flu Vaccination

25.     The GOA used funds from the National Treasury to purchase and distribute
vaccines and antiviral t eatment du ing the P oject’s enti e implementation. The P oject
helped to generate the necessary synergies among the different levels of government in
order to confront the pandemic and outline long-term intervention strategies. Payment for
results was a driving force that motivated authorities in the provinces to appropriately
record and document information on the doses applied.




                                             40
26.     During the two years of output certification, coverage above 90% of the target
population was established for the indicator “doses of A/H1N1 vaccines applied.? At the
end of the 2010 campaign, no deaths from H1N1 influenza had been reported within the
prioritized at-risk groups, with two deaths from H1N1 outside these groups reported.
During 2011 no deaths from the H1N1 virus were reported from any groups. In summary,
if we compare the data on mortality from the virus in 2009 (626 deaths) with the data
from 2010 and 2011, the success of the massive vaccination campaign conducted during
those two years is clearly apparent.

27.    In 2011 the anti-flu vaccine was incorporated into the national vaccination
calendar, demonstrating the importance that the GOA placed on reducing the
transmissibility of the influenza virus. According to PRONACEI reports, coverage rates
were as high as 87.6% in 2012 and 89.6% at SE 40 in 2013.

2.2.1.2. Anti-pneumococcal Vaccination

28.    Illnesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) continue to be a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Rates of infection from Sp have been
reported as high as 30-50% of Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases, with
mortality near 25%. The illness occurs more frequently among older adults (>55 years),
and individuals who are immunocompromised or who have chronic illnesses. Sp can
cause not only CAP, but also various serious systemic infections such as meningitis and
bacteremia, with high rates of mortality.

29.    In 2012 the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was incorporated into the National
Vaccination Calendar for children at two months (1 dose), four months (2 doses), and
twelve months (1 booster). Coverage has been 85% in 2012 and 82.4% in 2013,
according to PRONACEI reports.

2.2.2. Improvement in services to affected individuals

30.    In relation to persons with influenza-like symptoms, the project carried out
actions aimed at improving hospital services, financing antiviral treatments and
laboratory tests as outputs, as well as the provision of hospital inputs and equipment.

2.2.2.1 Outpatient treatment provided

31.     In both 2010 and 2011 a high level of compliance was demonstrated in the
p oject’s output 6, “outpatient treatments provided,? as measu ed by the numbe of
cases of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) reported to the SNVS, in relation to the number of
treatments anticipated. The p oject’s efforts to achieve certification in this indicator
generated indirect positive effects, such as an improvement in the level of reporting in the
provincial nodes in the SNVS, through the Complex Index for the Evaluation of the
National Health Surveillance System (SNVS) – Module C by the National Directorate of
Epidemiology (DE). This Index, developed in the p oject’s f amewo k, is designed to



                                            41
measure the status of reporting on the basis of data regularity and opportunity, as well as
reporting coverage and adequate use of the system.

32.    Among the primary institutional achievements linked to the reporting of
Influenza-Like Illnesses, the following a e wo th highlighting: (i) SNVS’s legitimacy as a
single epo ting system; (ii) SNVS’s visibility in the national political agenda and the
regional technical agenda; (iii) systematization of evaluation instruments; (iv) periodic
p oduction of MSAL’s Integ ated Su veillance Newslette ; and (v) the integ ation of
MSAL’s Su veillance A ea with othe p og ams.

2.2.2.2 Hospital treatment for Acute Respiratory Infections

33.     During the winter months, acute respiratory infections represent the primary
reason for doctor visits and inpatient treatment. While this indicator was not one of the
p oject’s outputs, it indicates the increase in reported events of acute respiratory
infections du ing the p oject’s implementation.

2.2.2.3 Laboratory tests conducted

34.     Among the main achievements identified by the Directorate of Epidemiology in
relation to laboratory surveillance are the following: (i) active monitoring of respiratory
viruses was maintained in Argentina since 2008, and was strengthened during and
following the influenza pandemic; (ii) the influenza outbreaks in 2011 were detected
early through SIVILA information and helped to characterize the increases in ILI cases,
including those not occurring during the winter season; (iii) the system was consolidated
as a communication tool through the use of virtual derivation; (iv) Argentina currently
contributes the greatest volume of information on respiratory viruses in the region, used
in the analysis and dissemination of information on the influenza situation; (v)
information on the situation in the country is available weekly through the Integrated
Surveillance Newsletter; (vi) information is analyzed and disseminated at provincial and
local levels; and (vii) SIVILA was consolidated as the single source of information on the
monitoring of respiratory viruses at the national level.

2.2.2.4 Inputs and Equipment

35.     With the acquisition of equipment, the network of 208 hospitals (with a total of
1,674 critical care hospital beds) was strengthened. If we consider that the equipment for
a critical care bed consists of a multiparametric monitor, infusion pump and oximeter,
equipment was provided for a total of 625 beds (37.33% of those available).

2.3 Primary factors affecting the Project’s execution

36.    The risks identified in the PAD are presented below, together with the way in
which the Project was able to mitigate them, and some results that indicate this.




                                            42
37.    Argentina could confront some challenges in order to acquire enough A/H1N1
vaccines necessary to vaccinate 8.5 million persons.

38.     The Pandemic Flu Vaccination Campaign was part of a comprehensive strategy
for preventing illnesses from the A/H1N1 Influenza in Argentina. The GOA acquired the
pandemic and trivalent vaccines with the pandemic strain for the amount of US
$88,000,000 through a bidding process carried out between November 2009 and January
2010 through what was known at that time as MSAL’s Expanded Immunizations
Program (PAI). During preparations for the Project, in January to March 2010,
consideration was given to the possibility of retroactive financing of this expenditure by
the Bank, but the standards for acquisition were not compatible, and therefore the partial
cancellation of the loan in this amount was requested in December 2010.

39.    The A/H1N1 vaccine currently being developed may cause adverse affects to
health with greater frequency and of a more serious nature than what was anticipated
and deemed tolerable.

40.     The risk-benefit assessment of the application of vaccines allows us to affirm that
the available vaccines are safe. The safety of vaccines and vaccination covers the
p oducts’ cha acte istics as well as the ways in which they are applied.
41.     In terms of the capacity for implementation, there are serious institutional
limitations in responding quickly and effectively to a wave of the long-term, virulent
A/H1N1 influenza epidemic.

42.     The GOA’s capacity to conf ont the second pandemic wave expected in 2010 was
proven to be effective. The coordination between the national and provincial levels in the
implementation of control and prevention actions was highly effective, as demonstrated
by the indicators of coverage and mortality from the virus during that year.

43.     Other factors not anticipated in the PAD that affected the project’s execution
Incompatibility between national standards for acquisitions and those of the financing
entity:

44.      The incompatibility between national standards for acquisitions and those of the
p oject’s financing entity gene ated the need to equest the pa tial cancelation of the loan
initially anticipated. Of US $229,000,000, a total of US $88,000,000 was cancelled, with
a loan of US $141,000,000 remaining. It is important to emphasize that this unforeseen
ci cumstance did not affect the p oject’s execution in any way, as acquisitions we e made
with funds from the national treasury.

Provincial political-institutional contexts

45.     Output 1, “Health Situation Rooms,? was influenced by ju isdictions’ political
decisions that had an impact on their implementation. We might especially mention the
case of the city of Buenos Aires which, by not signing on to Project FESP, could not
participate in the P oject’s financing of Situation Rooms. We would also mention the

                                              43
case of the Formosa province, where the change in health authorities led to the
suspension of activities in the Situation Room during the third year of implementation, as
it was not considered to be a priority within its overall policies.

46.     Outputs 2 and 3, “MO S fo the gene al population and fo the indigenous
population,? also executed at the p ovincial level, we e affected by the lack of
interinstitutional coordination among the various areas involved: health ministries,
communication departments and offices for promoting and assisting native peoples. This
was the case in La Pampa and Salta.

CHAPTER 3: Final considerations

47.     An important result of timely actions in anti-flu vaccination is that the number of
deaths from the A/H1N1 virus decreased from 626 in 2009, to 2 in 2010 (outside risk
groups), to 0 in 2011, as reported to the intensified surveillance system implemented
during the pandemic and in the years that followed.

48.     Regarding the anti-pneumococcal vaccination, efforts have been made to intensify
its application to the at-risk population. During the 2010 campaign, it became clear that
the eco ds of the vaccine’s application did not eflect the demand fo and application of
doses in the provinces. This led to the need for reinforcing the doses from the national
level to the SNVS for the 2011 campaign. That year the coverage achieved in terms of
the doses dist ibuted in all the count y’s p ovinces was 93.3%.

49.     The anti-pneumococcal vaccine, like the anti-flu vaccine, was incorporated into
the national vaccination calendar, beginning on January 1, 2012, for children under one
year of age. This was implemented together with strategies for diminishing
morbimortality from respiratory illnesses, primarily from pneumonia in children, since
pneumococcus may produce serious illness, with serious consequences and/or death.

50.    The high coverage achieved during the pandemic, in terms of reporting ILI in the
SNVS, was maintained with a high degree of compliance, and was used to evaluate the
provision of outpatient treatments to symptomatic patients, with 105.8% for 2010 and
99.1% for 2011, in relation to the goals proposed for the project.

51.     With regard to laboratory surveillance, the project consolidated the use of this
surveillance tool, reporting a significant level of compliance. In 2009 a total of 36,000
laboratory tests conducted (baseline) was reported to the SNVS, and between 2010 and
2011, a total of 65,341 tests for respiratory viruses were reported.

52.     An important externality from the project has been the use of SNVS components
as a single egist y system in all of the count y’s p ovinces. This is because in o de to
certify the application of vaccines (PRONACEI), the provision of outpatient treatments
(Module C2) and the application of laboratory tests (SIVILA Module), it was necessary
for the cases to be reported to the SNVS. This led to an improvement in the quality and



                                            44
timeliness of the information provided to the SNVS, in terms of obligatory reporting of
events.

53.     Although the project was designed in an emergency context, with the aim of
controlling the pandemic in Argentina caused by the A/H1N1 virus during 2009, two of
the main structural objectives were to strengthen surveillance systems and to improve
access to timely info mation fo making health decisions. Thus, one of the p oject’s
important contributions to these objectives was the implementation of Health Situation
Rooms (HSRs) in all of the count y’s p ovinces.

54.     The project promoted the design and implementation of communication
campaigns focused on prevention and self-care, directed at the general population and the
indigenous population in particular. The experience has been successful, since it
permitted the provinces to define strategic actions, and to implement and document them.
From an institutional perspective, this is considered an action to be replicated by other
programs in terms of interinstitutional management and coordination, with guidance from
the national level and implemented with provinces and within them, among the various
areas involved.

55.     In general, the project management model has been considered to be successful,
and has contributed to the optimization of resources, strengthening synergies among the
various actors involved, minimizing operational costs and contributing to strengthening
the count y’s Minist y of Health. Actively involved in p oject coo dination by the
International Financing Units were the technical teams from the Epidemiology
Department, PRONACEI, Health Economy Department, Communications area and the
FESP Project. With this model it was possible to reprogram operational and
administrative expenditures in line with technical components.

56.      The results-based financing model promoted changes in guidelines for the
management, evaluation and regulation of the organizations involved, facilitating
improvements in strategic and operational planning actions and the re-engineering of
processes and structures. The Situation Rooms were developed with this model, under a
scheme of incentives and the development of mechanisms for evaluating and controlling
results.

57.     The emergency context generated by the pandemic served to deepen the
commitment assumed in the provinces, formalized through the signing of letters of
adhe ence in the count y’s 23 ju isdictions. The guiding ole of the National Minist y of
Health with the Provincial Ministries of Health was strengthened in order to respond
effectively to the emergency.

58.    The study of the impact from health measures taken in Argentina to fight
influenza offers an estimate of the significant magnitude of the economic impact
generated by the Influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in the society during 2009 and 2010. This
impact was specifically in terms of direct costs for treatment and prevention, the loss of
productivity due to school and work absences, and the loss of opportunities for society.

Also offered is an estimate of the life years lost through premature death, adjusted by life
quality and disability.

59.    We can affirm that the implementation of the A/H1N1 Emergency Project not
only fulfilled the proposed objectives in a satisfactory manner, but it also contributed to
the development of institutional and management capacities at both national and
provincial levels in the area of public health policy implementation.
