BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF TECHNICAL AND MANUFACTURING TERMS
A. TECHNICAL TERMS
TERM                                               DESCRIPTION
1.  Plain Bearing                        A flat surface or cylindrical surface
of softer material than a load carry-
ing surface subject to continuous or
intermittent reciprocating or rotating
motion.
2.  Anti-Friction Bearing                A set of components harder than the
load carrying element, set apart from
each other by a set of rolling articles
usually divided by a separator. The
Brasov Bearings Project concerns
itself with rotating elements and
loads only.
3.  A.   Single Row Ball Bearing         A set of two cylindrical rings of
narrow annulus, each with a matching
semi-circular track whose purpose is
to guide a set of balls as they rotate
about a common center. One element,
called the outer race, has the ball
track on the internal section of the
annulus. The second element (which
rotates) has the ball track on the
external surface and its bore in
application is pressed onto a shaft.
The balls are eventually spaced
radially between the inner race and
outer race ball tracks by a two piece
ribbon steel separator whose halves
are riveted together at assembly.
(See Page 4 for sketch.)
B.   Double Row Ball Bearing         A ball bearing similar to 3.A. (above)
except that it has a double grooved
track separated by a narrow land on
the inner race and an outer race whose
bore has a common spherical surface for
both sets of balls to roll on. This
design tolerates misalignment between
shafts and housing bore axes. (See
Page 4 for sketch.)



ANNEX 1
Page 2
TERM                                               DESCRIPTION
C.   Tapered Roller Bearings         A bearing whose rolling elements are
truncated cones the included angle
of which is complimented by the inner
race track and outer race track such
that a trace of the track surfaces
and center line of the rollers all
converge in a common apex point
thereby assuring pure geometric
rolling contact. The large end of
the roller rides against a flange
on the inner race permitting thrust
capacity and accurate end location.
The assembly is held together with
a one piece steel separator. (See
Page 5 for sketch.)
D.   Cylindrical Roller Bearing    A bearing whose rolling elements are
straight cylindrical surfaces. These
bearings offer a compromise between
ball and taper bearings in speed
and load carrying capacity. Their
straight surface elements permit
many combinations of design and
application. (See Page 5.)
E.   Spherical Roller Bearings       A bearing whose rollers have a
spherical ground surface whose
center line axis that passes
through an apex center about which
the center line of the radius of
curvature for the inner and outer
races meet. This bearing has more
load carrying capacity than its ball
bearing counterpart but runs at a
lower rate of speed and is not as
stiff as the tapered bearing. (See
Page 5 for sketch.)
4.  A.   Inner Race                      Usually the rotating element of an
anti-friction bearing that is pressed
onto a shaft with a press fit estab-
lished in accordance with load and
application requirements.
B.   Outer Race                      Usually the stationary element of
an anti-friction bearing that is
pressed into a housing against a
locating shoulder with a fit varying
from light slip to a heavy press
depending upon load and application
requirements.



ANNEX 1

TERM                                               DESCRIPTION
5.  Separator                            That component of an anti-friction
bearing which separates the balls or
rollers so that the load is equally
shared by all rolling elements under
operating loads.
6.  A.   Ball                            A spherical shaped rolling element
that rotates in contained tracks
between inner and outer races at
high rates of speed, light load and
precision.
B.   Roller                          A rolling element that provides con-
tact between inner and outer race
tracks whose ends are normal to
center line axis of the roller. The
diametric surface trace of the roller
may be a straight line parallel to
the center line, at an angle, or be
a segment of circle whose centerline
is normal to the roller centerline.
7.  Seals                                Devices made of rubber, plastic or
resins inserted between inner and
outer races in permanently lubri-
cated bearings to keep grease from
escaping during operation.
8.  Sheild                               Device made of sheet metal to resist
migration of gross hostile particles
from entering into rolling contact
element area during operation.
Usually supplied in severe oper-
ating conditions.

10. Bearing Steel Grades
A.   Carburizing Grades              SAE 8620, 4120, 4320
Low carbon content requires carbon
enrichment on surface with depths
varying in accordance with size and
load. Combination of hard skin and
tough ductile core makes bearings
using these materials excellent for
heavy loads and heavy press fits.
This combination is often necessary
where the bearing is mounted in a
dissimilar material such as aluminum
whose thermal characteristics subtract
from a press fit. The structural
strength of the bearing provides
rigidity.

B.   Hardening Steels                SAE 50100 and 52100
These materials harden completely
through and have excellent wear char-
acteristics and good rolling fatigue
properties. Because there is no soft
core they work well with ball bearings
with the high unit loading at the ball
contact surfaces.
B. MANUFACTURING TERMS
11.  Hot Forming Machine                  A machine designed to accept rack
loads of hot rolled bar steel and
automatically feed these bars (up
to 2-3/4" diameter) through a series
of induction heating coils into a
heavy duty horizontal crank press.
Externally the hot former has the
appearance of the "Nut Formers,"
used in the fastner industries. The
machine is equipped with cut off bar
and a transfer arrangement so that a
hot slug is upset, flattened and ex-
panded, dimpled and pierced forming
single or double rings depending on
size and geometry. This equipment
runs from 50 to 100 strokes/minute.
12.  Ring Rolling Machines                These machines take a hot ring (2200 F)
of small diameter and heavy wall and
by rolling the wall between a pair
of pinch rolls that exerts a squeezing
force on the ring section, expands the
diameter up to twice the original ring
size. This equipment can produce parts
from 100 to 1200 per hour depending on
size of part and whether it is fed by
hand or automatically loaded.



ANNEX 1

TERM                                               DESCRIPTION
13.  Cold Forming                          Essentially a form of coining in
which a piece of cold steel (usually
a sheared slug from a round bar) is
put into a large heavy duty crank
press (transfer style) and squeezed
in a progressive series of operations
into desired form. The frictional
forces against die surfaces in this
type of operation are enormous (up
to 300,000 P.S.I.) and die life is
intolerable economically unless the
part is properly annealed and chemi-
cally treated with various phosphate
and molybdenum sulfide coatings devel-
oped for this purpose.  The carbon
content of bearing steels to date is
the limiting factor in this process.
So far, only the carburizing grades
of steel with 20 points, or less, of
carbon have been cold formed. Many
firms are investigating the applica-
tion of warm form (1000 to 1200 F)
methods for SAE 52100 but there are
no successful operations in use today.
14.  Annealing                            A heat treat process wherein parts
are brought up to the sub-critical
temperature of the steel involved
and slowly cooled, at a controlled
rate to refine the crystalline struc-
ture of the part. Its purpose is to
soften the steel and make it more
ductile so it will properly flow
into die cavities without cracking
in cold form operations. It also
softens 52100 steel so that it can
be machined.
15.  Primary Machining                    This part of the process is performed
on single and multiple spindle lathes
immediatley after the annealing oper-
ation from forging. The rough rings
from forging are machined into shape
for the various inner and outer race
configurations (ball bearing, taper,
etc.).

TERM                                               DESCRIPTION
16.  Grinding                             All bearing races are finished to
precision size after secondary heat
treat where the rockwell hardness is
increased from about R 18 to R 60 for
c       c
wear characteristics. Every surface
on the bearing inner and outer races
is ground except for chamfers and
radii. The equipment is highly
sophisticated and is the final
result of long years of develop-
ment. Most of the equipment that
handles parts up to 4-1/2 inches in
diameter is fully automatic with a
great many self-monitoring features.
17.  Super Finish                         When trying to obtain surfaces under
5 micro inches by grinding, the pro-
cess becomes skill oriented requir-
ing manpower. The superfinishing
process uses shapped ultrafine abra-
sives applied with rapid oscillating
strokes as opposed to grinding which
removes stock with a rotating cir-
cular grinding wheel. Super finish-
ing removes from .0001 to .0003 stock
and improves the surface finish of
parts only but does not correct
geometry. Grinding removes any-
where from .010 to .075 stock and
generates the roundness and flatness
necessary for bearings.
18.  In Process Gaging                    This gaging is an integral part of a
grinding machine that measures the
surface of a bearing part during
the grinding cycle and sends a
signal to the machine controls to
stop the cycle when proper size has
been reached. This system is man-
datory for high volume bearing manu-
facture.

19.  Post Process Gaging                  Defined as being an automatic gage
at the end of line of machines
arranged to check all of the dimen-
sions on parts generated by the line
of machines. Good parts are passed
on to wash and final assembly. Bad
parts are diverted into tote pans
for review by overcheck inspectors.
20. Ball Processing
A.   Heading                         A form of hi speed cold forming.
Coiled wire is fed into a horizon-
tal power press where a slug is cut
off and formed into a crude ball at
up to 500 strokes per minute. Parts
are then tumbled and passed on to soft
grinding.
B.   Grinding (Soft & Hard)          Balls are put into a hopper that ele-
vates the balls and feed them sequen-
tially into the center of a rotating
spiral wheel above which is a rotating
grinding wheel that applies grinding
force through a hydraulic cylinder.
Balls circulate through recycling
continuously until proper size
before heat treat is obtained.
Multiple passes for roundness and
finish are necessary during hard
grind.
C.   Ball Lapping                    This process is much the same as
grinding except that finer, denser
wheels are used. Because of the
close tolerance required at this
stage of the process, balls are
kept in individual lots as they go
through inspection to eliminate
the necessity of segregation into
classes.

21.  Assembly                             Inner races and outer races are
individually measured on their
rolling contact surfaces and a ball
or roller size is selected to give
the proper internal clearance upon
assembly.  The reason for this is
that it is impossible to custom
grind, the three elements of a
bearing by mass production tech-
nique and control the process
size close enough to arrive at
the necessary assembled internal
running clearance required by the
product.
When the proper elements have been
selected (automatically in high
volume) the cage is inserted and
fastened to make a self-contained
unit. The bearing now is washed,
lubricated, inspected for visual
defects, radial play, overall dimen-
sions and noise test. It is then
wrapped, packed and shipped.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION
OF ROMANIAN BEARINGS INDUSTRY
A.   Historical Background
1.        The Romanian bearings industry started in 1949, when the then
Brasov Truck Plant, which was located at the current site of the Brasov
Bearings Plant started domestic production of bearings on a small scale.
Since this modest beginning 27 years ago, the industry has made rapid
progress and in 1975 supplied about 86% (47 million pieces) of domestic
bearings needs while also exporting 22 million bearings (31% of production)
from four different bearings plants.
B.   Brief History of Individual Plants
2.        The Brasov Bearings Plant since its inception has beeen the
largest bearings plant in Romania. Its production gradually increased
from 0.22 million pieces in 1950 to 1.04 million pieces in 1955, as plant
facilities were gradually expanded and more products added to the product
line. After the plant exclusively started producing bearings and was
designated as Brasov Bearings Enterprise in 1959, its production has in-
creased more rapidly to meet demands of fast expanding domestic industrial
sector and to enter export markets - production increased to 11.0 million
units in 1965 and 28.5 million in 1975. The plant which will be the last
of the three existing plants to be modernized, will remain the largest
domestic facility after the completion of the proposed expansion program
which will raise the annual production to 53.0 million units. Brasov also
produces the largest mix of bearings amongst Romanian plants. Its product
mix includes: (a) single row radial ball bearings; (b) double row radial
axle and self-aligning ball bearings (c) tapered roller bearings; (d) needle
and cardan bearings; and (e) plain and other special bearings. Brasov sells
a part of its ball production and some forgings to the Birlad Plant. Brasov
Enterprise is also the base of the Brasov Bearings Central (CIROA).
3.        The second bearings plant developed in Romania is at Birlad in the
eastern part of the country. It was one of the first major industrial plants
to be located in the area as part of the Government's policy of balanced
regional development. Birlad was constructed between 1950 - 52, and in 1955
produced 0.63 million bearings out of the total domestic production of 1.67
million units. Birlad continued to increase production of relatively heavy
bearings, particularly roller bearings, by low volume techniques until
1973 when production reached 4.9 million units (Attachment I). In 1974, it
commissioned a new facility built with technical assistance from Koyo-Seiko
of Japan. Under this expansion program, new forging capacity was installed
and two new automated Hi-Volume production lines were added to produce



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
single row radial ball bearings, which were earlier manufactured mostly at
Brasov but on less efficient equipment. Birlad currently has a production
capacity of about 30 million units and continues to produce single and
double row cylindrical roller bearings, axial ball bearings and oscillating
barrel-type roller bearings (Annex 1). Due to the limited capacity of its
forge shop and the absence of a ball shop, Birlad purchases forgings for
inner and outer races and balls mostly from Alexandria but also some from
Brasov. Birlad tentatively expects to further expand its capacity by about
50% to 47 million units in the next five years.
4.        The third and currently the most modern bearings plant in Romania
is located in Alexandria about 150 km south-west of Bucharest. This green
field plant, commissioned in March 1974, was designed, built and initially
operated in close collaboration with Koyo-Seiko. The plant is comparable
to any Hi-Volume bearings plant built elsewhere in recent years and is
operating well. Since it has only Hi-Volume production facilities (the plant
has three full automated lines that start with forged pieces and end with
assembled bearings), Alexandria has a relatively narrow product line of
single row ball bearings and tapered roller bearings. A significant part
of Alexandria plant's production is exported to Bank member countries,
including over 30% of production sold to leading bearings manufacturers.
5.        The fourth and the smallest bearings production facility is
located at Ploesti, an important industrial center, located midway between
Bucharest and Brasov. Actually, this facility which primarily produces
heavy bearings needed by the chemical industries, still does not belong to
CIROA and operates as a department of a Chemical Enterprise. Its current
production of about 1500 tons of large bearings is slated to increase to about
4,000 tons under a major expansion program scheduled to be completed in 1978.
At that time, this facility will become an independent enterprise under CIROA.
The expansion program will be executed in technical collaboration with Rollway
Bearings of U.S., which specializes in large bearings used in chemical,
earthmoving and construction machinery. The U.S. Export-import Bank will
finance the purchase of equipment. Except for importing forged rings with
external diameter exceeding 1000 mm, the plant will have a high degree of
vertical integration like other bearings plants in Romania.
C.   Industry Rationalization Program
6.        Major changes took place in the bearings industry during 1971-75
Plan period. Not only were two major and modern new facilities constructed
and commissioned and production of bearings increased 170% from 26 million
units to 71 million units (capacity installed increased more sharply to 98
million) but the industry also launched a major production rationalization
program to improve efficiency. As mentioned earlier, new automated facil-
ities at Alexandria and Birlad now produce large volume bearings earlier
produced at one or more locations by less efficient low-volume production
techniques. At the same time, it was decided to: (a) eliminate production
of the same bearing at more than one location: (b) produce bearing needed



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
in relatively small volume mostly at Brasov, though some would continue at
Birlad; (c) minimize the variations of the same basic size produced by con-
verting the users to standard bearings, in order to streamline production
processes; and (d) specialize production at different plants by type (groups)
of bearing (e.g. cylindrical roller bearings at Birlad, needle and cardan
bearings at Brasov, large chemical and earthmoving machinery bearings at
Ploeisti etc.) with an exception that single row radial ball bearings and
tapered roller bearings would continue to be produced at more than one plant
as indicated below:

4. Single row cylindrical                        -           x
5. Double row cylindrical                        -           x
6. Bearings for cardanic transmission
and needle roller                             x
7. Spherical roller                              -           x
8. Tapered Roller
OD 66-350 mm                                  x
OD 31-120 mm                                  -           -             x
7.        This rationalization program follows the trends in the bearings
industry elsewhere and is clearly desirable. It should lead to cost reductions
even when real wages are increasing in Romania. With the proposed expansion
and modernization of the Brasov plant and the opening of the Plotesti plant,
most of the objectives of the rationalization program would have been achieved.

D.   Organization of Bearings Industry
8.        Like most other productive assets in the Romanian economy, the
bearing industry is owned and managed by the State. Romania is a centrally
planned economy and all policy decisions concerning the industry are made
by the Government authorities in Bucharest; the framework within which all
technical and economic activities are carried out is laid down in laws passed
by the Grand National Assembly. A detailed description of the Romanian
planning and the decision making systems under which the industry operates
is given in the Bank report "No 492a-RO Planning and the Planning System in
Romania." Once the policy decisions are made and the quantitative objectives
for the subsector determined, the bearings industry receives the necessary
resources from the State and is obliged by law to meet the given targets. The
organization structure of the industry, depicted in Annex 2.3, consists of a
three step hierarchy as in other ministries. The Technical Ministry has the
final authority over the activities of all units belonging to the sub-
sector. Under it, Industrial Centrals are responsible for coordinating the
planning and production scheduling of similar enterprises or enterprises
engaged in the production of the same product. At the bottom are the operat-
ing units called Enterprises which are responsible for meeting production
and other economic targets set by higher authorities.
The Ministry
9.        The bearings industry belongs to the Ministry of Machine Building
Industries, one of the nine technical ministries responsible for the indus-
trial sector in Romania, which was created in 1975 through the amalgamation
of two technical ministries - Ministry of Heavy Machinery and Ministry of
Machine Tool Building. The ministry owns about 150 enterprises coordinated
by some 10 centrals that produce automobiles, trucks, earthmoving machinery,
machine-tools, power generating equipment, steel, chemical and other heavy
machinery in addition to engineering goods like structures and bearings. It
is responsible for the overall performance of the subsector including achieve-
ment of plan targets, and plays the primary role in coordinating the activi-
ties of the subsector with other parts of the economy, in translating overall
economic objectives of the country into specific financial and physical tar-
gets for individual industries and in the overall design and approval of
investment projects. Under the Vice-Minister responsible for planning and
execution of new projects in the ministry, are the Central Design Institute
and the Construction Trusts responsible for engineering and construction.
However, unlike some other technical ministries, the Ministry of Machine
Building does not have, under its control, all the foreign trade enterprises,
engaged in importing and exporting products under its jurisdictions. For
example, TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT, which has the exclusive right to export and
import bearings, belongs to the Ministry of Foreign Trade. This organiza-
tional separation of the foreign trade responsibilities from other aspects
of the bearing industry is currently under review by the Romanian authorities
to determine if its elimination would strengthen the export marketing capabil-
ities of the industry.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 5
The Central
10.       All four bearings enterprises belong to the Industrial Central
for Bearings and Assembly Components (CIROA), which is located in Brasov.
As in other cases in Romania, the senior staff of the Central also doubles
as the senior staff of Brasov Enterprise, which is the largest productive
unit within the Central. The role played by the centrals in the planning
and management of the industrial sector was enhanced somewhat after the
organizational reforms introduced in 1974, under which some of the planning
and supervision functions previously belonging to the technical ministries
were transferred to the centrals. However, the basic function of CIROA
still remains in the planning area. It acts as a conduit between the
Ministry and the Enterprises for this purpose and is responsible for co-
ordinating the preparation of annual and five year financial plans of the
enterprises for which State assistance is needed and for allocating
production targets to individual enterprises on the basis of industry
targets finalized by the ministry. CIROA, through its Design and Research
Center supplements the engineering staffs of the enterprises. It is also
responsible for conducting negotiations with foreign buyers and suppliers.
It offers trouble-shooting services to the enterprises in case of need.
The Central also keeps most the investment and reserve funds belonging
to the enterprises. However, CIROA plays a relatively insignificant
role in the day to day production oriented activities of its member
enterprises.
11.       Within the Ministry of Machine Building Industries, CIROA is res-
ponsible for the production and domestic distribution of bearings and indus-
trial fasteners (assembly components). Under its jurisdictions are four
plants engaged in the production of bearings, five plants that produce indus-
trial fasteners, a warehousing enterprise that sells and distributes bearings
and fasteners through its warehouses in different regions, and the Design
and Research Center for Bearings, Fasteners and Assembly Components which is
responsible for designing new products and machinery as well for engineering
new projects.
12.       The Directors of all enterprises report to the General Director
of CIROA who chairs the executive committee of the Central composed of
worker representatives and managers from the enterprises. On matters
concerning ongoing operations, the General Director is responsible to
the Vice-Minister in charge of the industry and on matters concerning new
investments he reports to the Vice-Minister responsible for planning and
executing all new projects, including major expansions, in the Ministry
of Machine Building.
The Enterprise
13.       The Brasov enterprise like other industrial enterprises in Romania,
is primarily a production-oriented organization with only limited decision-
making responsibilities outside that area. It became a legal entity in 1959
when it was approved by the Council of Ministers and registered at the
Ministry of Finance. It has its own production plans (based on targets set



ANNEX 2-1
Page 6
by the plan for the Central), prepares financial statements, has its own
bank accounts, and can borrow money from appropriate banks. It maintains
economic, financial and legal relations with other organizations (generally
through CIROA). But any major changes in its facilities, production targets,
or in product mix, must be approved by the Council of Ministers. In short,
the enterprise has limited autonomy.
14.       The organization structure of the enterprise is shown in Annex 3.1.
Technically, the ultimate decision making power lies with the Worker's
General Assembly, which includes all the workers of Brasov Enterprise and
normally meets twice a year to examine the operating results and review
the performance of the Working People's Executive Committee. This Executive
Committee, consisting of elected representatives of workers and also some
key members of the Management, is chaired by the Director (or the General
Director) of the Enterprise who is normally appointed by the Minister of
Machine Building. The General Manager is responsible for the day to day
operations and implements the decisions taken by the Executive Committee,
through a team of key managers, including a technical manager responsible
for production and all technical matters, a commercial manager responsible
for sales and procurement and a chief accountant responsible for finance
and accounting departments. The Engineering Department has the primary
responsibility for implementing the expansion project.

ROMANIA
BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
A BRIEF NOTE ON CURRENT AND PROPOSED
PRODUCTION PROCESSES AT BRASOV
A.   Background
1.        The bearing industry is a mature industry that has been subject
to much competitive pressure over the years. The basic choice of process
is pretty much dictated by the requirements of the product itself, which
must be consistent in quality, durable in performance and still cheap in
price. Therefore, most bearings are made of high quality steels (which offer
both durability and economy) through known metal forming processes that
permit mass scale production at low costs. The races start with some form
of alloy steel that is given a rough form in the primary state and then
is heat treated for wear characteristics, after which it is ground and
assembled. Many machine tool companies around the world have been started
and maintained for fifty or sixty years to primarily serve the bearings
industry. These companies supply the same basic equipment to all bearing
manufacturers, and thus the basic production process used by most manu-
facturers is the same. However, most large bearing producers also make
their own specialized equipment to make particular types of bearings and
to introduce process innovations developed in-house.
B.   Manufacture of Inner and Outer Races
2.        Choice of Basic Material and Rough Forming:  At present, most of the
bearing production in Europe and Asia is from 52100 (chrome) steel, while in
the United States ball bearings are made from 52100 steel (through hardening)
and roller bearings are made from carburizing grades (soft core) of steel.
This has come about because American consumers prefer more load carrying
capacity and heavier press fits than their European counterparts in addition
to the fact the American steel industry has enough capacity and demand to
supply "tailor made" alloys for the bearings industry. This can influence
the selection of process for the rough forming stage, because carburizing
bearing steels can be cold formed and 52100 steel (at the present state of
the art) cannot.
3.        The Brasov enterprise makes all of its products (single row and
double row ball bearings, straight roller and tapered roller bearings, needle
roller and Universal Joint-Cardan-bearings) out of 52100 chrome steel, as most
European manufacturers do. The races start in a well equipped forge shop
where bar stock is formed into inner and outer races by various process
steps which are determined by the size and shape of the end product. Hi-
Volume parts (single row ball bearings) are made two at a time on a con-
tinuous hot form transfer machine (Hatebur of Switzerland) that makes an
inner and outer race ring simultaneously at 70 strokes per minute. Some of
the larger Hi-Volume parts are then rolled out to a larger diameter on ring
rolling machines built in Romania. For other product lines, inner and outer



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
races are made separately on upsetters, drop forges, and hand-operated ring
rolling machines. There is also a very large continuous Wagner processing
system that makes big heavy wall races in much the same manner as the Hatebur
but at a rate of 6 per minute. All of the parts made are then annealed in
large continous furnaces and sent to the primary machining area where the
parts are shot blasted as needed before being further processed.
4.        The basic forging process used in the bearing production has not
changed much in recent years. The process, and the basic equipment, used at
Brasov is similar to that used in most bearing factories elsewhere, except
that new models of equipment are much more productive. Due to the nature of
the forging process, there is no difference in equipment used for the Hi Volume
and Low Volume production of bearings. However forging equipment utiliza-
tion rates for Hi Volume production are much higher, due to less frequent
tool changes which involve substantial set up time. Since modern hot forge
presses are quite expensive, the production of bearings in short production
runs substantially increases the production cost due to the lower equipment
utilization.
5.        Machining:  The Low Volume primary machining area will continue to
use multiple spindle and single spindle chucking machines in sequence, one
machine per operator to turn most of the forge shop output into races ready
for heat treat. A few parts considered too small to be economically forged
would be made from bar stock on multiple spindle bar machines.
6.        Hi Volume components would be roughed out on multiple spindle
chuckers and then finished on the ends with thru feed double disc grinders,
and finished on the outside diameter on continuous thru feed centerless
grinders. All of these pre-finished rings would then be processed thru an
integrated manufacturing line automatically fed into and out of individual
single spindle lathes, where outside diameter and inside diameter ball races
forms, chamfers and radii are machined onto the rings. The integrated scheme
of manufacturing by Japanese technology is already used in Alexandria and
Birlad, and would be extended to Brasov.
7.        Secondary Heat-Treatment:  All races - for both Hi-Volume and
Low Volume would be sent from the machining area into a secondary heat treat
area to harden and temper the parts in continuous furnaces. Both inner and
outer races are then to be put through double disc end-grinders and centerless
outside diameter grinders before the work is delivered and taken away in large
gondolas.
8.        Grinding and Super Finishing:  Low volume inner and outer races
would continue to be brought to separate colony style groups of machines where
they are processed on microcentric style grinders. Micro-centric grinding is
a centerless grinding technique that grinds narrow cylindrical parts round
without the necessity of mounting the part to be ground on a mechanical chuck
or an arbor. Instead, it has rotating magnetic plate engage the end-face of a
narrow cylindrical part whose center line is set off center from the center



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
line of the magnetic plate in two planes by about .005 in each plane. The
resulting force of the grinding wheel as it engages the part being ground is
directed down forcing the part being ground into a pair of work support
carbide shoes that act as the work blade and regulating wheel of the original
thru-feed centerless grinding process. Inner races have the ball race track
ground with the pathway surface locating on carbide shoes against a magnetic
backing plate that resists the driving force of the grinding wheel as its
surface abrades the part. An "in process" guage is in continuous contact with
the part as it is being ground; when blue print size is reached a signal
orders the machine to retract, unload the part, load another part and recycle.
The refinish bore grind and ball track superfinish equipment operates in
similar centerless fashion. The operator hand loads the machines and inspects
his own work before disposing into tote pans. Outer race equipment functions
the same as inner race equipment, loading and unloading automatically with "in
process" gage controls.
9.        Hi Volume inner and outer races would be processed thru the same
operations on the same type of equipment as used in "Low Volume" operations
described above, except that the equipment used would be more specialized and
machines arranged in order of process sequence in continuous lines as opposed
to "colonies" of similar equipment being located in a general area. Each
continuous line would be at a right angle to a long multi-lane conveyor.
Parts would start at a bulk elevating hopper loaded from the aisle with
a fork truck. The parts would be automatically fed into the first machine of
the line which upon completion of its operation would dispose the part into
a track that feeds the next machine; at the ejection of the part from the
final machine it will be fed into an automatic "Post Process" gage that would
passo good work into the long collection conveyer and reject faulty work into
a pan for repairs or scrap as determined by the inspection department.
C.   Ball Manufacturing
10.       Balls, rollers and separators from both Hi Volume and Low Volume
bearings would be made in common shops for both groups of products. Under
the project, ball processing at Brasov will undergo a major change due to new
"know how" introduced from Japan. Some of the ball grinding and lapping
equipment is being replaced with equipment to be built locally, under license
in accordance with Japanese practice. This equipment produces a much finer
ball requiring only lot type inspection in place of individual ball selection
which will help to reduce labor cost in the inspection area. It is absolutely
necessary isn the manufacture of bearings for use in so called "silent motors"
to have good ball quality because good ball geometry is necessary for quiet
running bearings. The proposed changes would permit production of such high
quality balls.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 4
D.   Roller Manufacturing
11.       There will be some improvement in the manufacture of tapered rollers
wherein the installation of continuous integrated lines with rough grind,
semi-finish, end grind and hone operations would permit the product to flow
from operation to operation. Tapered rollers would start with material in
coil or cut lengths of cold drawn rod (for diameters over 3/4") that is cut
off and cold formed automatically. Parts would then be tumbled soft, end-
ground and heat treated. After heat treat, the O.D. and end grind process will
be repeated and then super finished on the diameter before being sent into the
inspection department for a visual check and then automatically classification
for size and angle.
E.   Separator Manufacturing
12.       Separator manufacture would continue to use conventional methods
used in other bearing plants world wide. The production expansion will
bring new, better engineered transfer presses into operation that will give
improved quality and greater output.
F.   Assembly and Final Inspection
13.       Hi-Volume races would be transported from the end of the grinding
lines by means of the aforementioned long, powered collection conveyors to
the assembly area where the races will be stored in spiral storage units ahead
of a complete automated integrated assembly line. The races would meet with
the balls and separators (transported by internal trucks) at the ball insertion
stations where the components would be matched for proper internal clearance
controlled by an automated inspection and assembly machine. Thus, separators
will be riveted in place and the bearings put thru an automatic wash, vibration
check, radial play, overall mechanical dimensions and visual check and auto-
matic greasing before being sent on to the seal and shield insertion stations
as determined by customer requirements. Parts would be wrapped and packed by
hand at this stage.
14.       Full automation of the assembly operation through an assembly lines
will be introduced in the Hi-Volume production, substantially improving
quality and operator productivity. Ten different sizes of ball bearings would
be going through this line and Brasov intends to change these lines over four
times a year.
15.       The Low Volume area intends to continue using manual assembly
and inspection operations. However, even here Brasov intends to hold the
number of its inspection people constant while increasing the output. This
labor productivity improvement will be brought about by the increased use
of "in process" machine control gages which will permit the inspection of

races on an A.Q.L. basis instead of the 100% inspection requirements now in
use. Similarly, the proposed improvements in ball processes would reduce
inspection needs in the assembly area and also permit introduction of semi-
mechanized assembly units.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
DOMESTIC BEARINGS MARKET AND MARKETING
1.        In recent years, most of bearing production in Romania has been
for consumption internally as is shown in the following table:
Destination of Romanian Bearings:  1970-1985
(Millions of Pieces)
Actual             Est.          Forecast
1970    1972    1974    1976    1978    1980    1985

2.        As the table shows, until recently, more than two-thirds of the
Romanian production of bearings was for local consumption.  The forecast
for 1976-85 shows a slight drop in this proportion due to the proposed
large increases in export targets and the expected slowdown in the growth
of domestic demand.
3.        For the Brasov enterprise, both the production and export targets
were recently revised downwards, due to the difficulties anticipated in achiev-
ing even higher export targets. Whereas initially the 1980 production target
was for 46 million bearings and export target was 15.1 million, these have
now been revised downwards to 43 million and 12.0 million respectively. The
revised projections are shown in the following table:

Total Production               28.5    27.8    34.0    43.0    49.0    53.0
of which:

Because of their very different nature, the export and the internal market
of bearings are discussed separately. A discussion of the internal market
is given below and export markets are discussed in Annex 4.2.
Domestic Romanian Market Demand
4.        The main consumers of bearings in Romania as in other countries,
have been in the transportation sector, machine and technological equipment
building sector and the electric motor and generator manufacturing sectors.
These sectors have historically shown rapid growth, thereby generating an
equally rapid growth in demand for bearings. The following table shows the
average annual growth rate for these sectors, for 1950-75.

5.        The main bearing consuming sectors have shown a much higher growth
rate compared with the 10% growth of the national income. This has created
a very high growth in the demand for bearings within Romania. The average
annual growth rate for demand over 1950-75 period has been 20.2%. In the
past this demand could not be satisfied by local production and a large
proportion of the bearings consumed in Romania had to be imported. The
table below shows the proportion of bearings that have been imported.

6.        Historically the local production of bearings has not been suffi-
cient to satisfy the demand for bearings and over a third of the bearings
consumed locally have had to be imported. Until 1973, such a supply situa-
tion of course had its impact on demand too. In Romania, as in many other
developing coutries, foreign exchange is a relatively scarce commodity whose
use is actively discouraged by state directives to reduce import content of
the goods produced. With the improvement in local supply situation between
1970-75, and a sharply decreased reliance on imports (in proportional terms),
some hidden demand for bearings also came into play.
7.        However, in future, the opportunity for growth of demand for locally
made bearings through import substitution would diminish. The recent high
growth rate of demand in Romania for locally made bearings is not likely to
be sustained during the next five years. Even then the growth in demand for
locally produced bearings would still be high owing to the continued vigorous
expansion of the industrial and transportation sectors. The table below shows
the relationship between increase in production of various sectors of the eco-
nomy and the corresponding increases in the consumption of bearings by that
sector.

ANNEX 4-1

The above demand forecasts, developed by CIROA, appear to be excessively
conservative. As shown above historically, domestic demand for bearings has
grown at rates much higher than the growth rates registered by the overall
Romanian economy. Therefore, it appears that during 1975-80 demand for
bearings should grow at a rate higher than 6.9% projected by CIROA since
the national economy is planned to grow at an annual rate of between 9-10%,
or slightly higher than that registered during 1970-75; the same should
hold true during 1980-85.
9.        The transportation and agricultural equipment sector, the largest
consumer of bearings, showed the annual growth rate of 13.5% during 1970-75.
Though the 12% growth rate in transportation and tractors sector was the
main contributor to the expansion of Romanian bearings consumption, other
significant factors were the increasing sophistication of equipment and
import substitution. During the 1975-80 period, the scope for import substi-
tution would be smaller and the growth rate of production in transportation
and tractors sector is expected to slow down. These factors would com-
bine to reduce the future growth rate of consumption of bearings in this
subsector below the recent levels, but the projected growth rate of 4.3%
for 1975-1985 appears overly conservative.
10.       Technological equipment (e.g. machine tools) showed a relatively
slower growth rate of consumption of bearings during 1970-75. The growth rate
of consumption was about 11.2% per year which compares with 14.4% average
annual growth in production of that sector. No significant import substitu-
tion took place (as far as bearing consumption is concerned) in this sector.
This was mainly due to the small and dispersed nature of demand which made
local production of these bearings a lower priority item and also an economi-
cally less justifiable alternative. However, by 1975 the production in that
sector had grown sufficiently to create demand for large batch sizes, which
would enable the Romanian bearing industry to supply those bearings at
competitive prices. During 1975-80 period, therefore, import substitution
is expected to be an important factor affecting demand for bearings in the
'Technological Equipment' sector. Easy availability of locally produced
bearings is expected to bring out the hidden demand for such bearings. For
that reason, an average annual growth rate of 13.3% is achievable during
1975-80 even though the production in that sector will grow by only 11.7%
per annum. This dramatic growth would raise the proportion of bearings for
internal consumption going to technological equipment manufacturers from its
9% level in 1975 to a 15% level by 1985.
11.       The proportion of Romanian bearings going to the replacement market
has historically been high. It was 31% in 1970 and 25% in 1975. As the qual-
ity of the Romanian bearings and other equipment improve, this proportion
is expected to go down further and may reach a level of about 22% by 1985.
Therefore, a much slower growth in demand is expected, but the 4.9% average
annual growth in demand for 1975-85 appears conservative even if substantial
quality improvements do materialize. The actual demand may turn out to be
substantially higher, particularly if the national economy expands as planned.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
12.       The highest growth rate in demand for internally manufactured
bearings during 1970-75 took place in the 'Other' category, which accounts
for about one fourth of total domestic sales. This represents many small
users of bearings which are not included in any of the major categories such
as the manufacturers of home appliances like vacuum cleaners. This high
growth rate in demand resulted in the increase of the percentage of locally
produced bearings consumed under the 'Other' category from 19% in 1970 to
25% ir 1975. This high growth in demand was due to the tapping of hidden
demand which was made possible by the rapid build-up of production capacity
during 1970-75. The opportunity for tapping still latent sources of demand
may be smaller during 1975-80. Hence a much smaller growth rate of demand
of about 6%, is projected during 1975-80 and only 4% during 1980-85. This
would result in a decline of the proportion of locally consumed Romanian
bearings going to 'Other' category from 25% in 1975 to 22% in 1985. Again,
considering the future growth rates planned for the economy, these estimates
may prove too low.
13.       The second highest growth rate in demand for bearings in Romania
has been in the electric motor and generators manufacturing sector, account-
ing for 9% of domestic sales in 1975. In that sector the demand grew at an
average annual rate of 13.0% during 1970-75. This high growth rate resulted
from the relatively high growth of production (14.1% per year) in that sector.
With the 13% average annual growth in production planned for 1975-80 period,
this high growth rate in demand for bearings going to the electric motor and
generator producers, is expected to continue. The 14.6% average annual growth
in the demand projected for 1975-80 period appears reasonable.
Romanian Bearings Market: Supply
14.       To supply the above mentioned demand for bearings, in the early
years, a large proportion of bearings was imported (para. 5). Some anti-
friction bearings were being manufactured by the consumers themselves. The
most significant example was the truck factory in Brasov. In 1949, this
factory had established a separate shop for manufacturing bearings. The
shop became the nucleus for the growth of the bearing industry in Romania.
Starting with a production of about 220,000 units in 1950, the production
was expanded to 1.04 million units in 1955. This was achieved by expansion
of production in the Brasov shop as well as setting up of a new factory in
Birlad in 1952. In 1974, production was also started in a new factory set up
in Alexandria with Japanese collaboration. The evolution of production in the
three units is shown in the Table below.

15.       The bearing production has grown at a faster rate than the demand
for locally produced bearings.  This has allowed Romania to export bearings
in recent years. In 1975, about 22 million pieces were exported which
accounted for a third of the production of bearings in Romania that year.
The projected growth in domestic demand and exports in the next ten years is
indicated in the table below.

Exports/Dom. Prod.   31%   47%    46%    44%    46%   44%   43%
However, as mentioned above, the estimates of growth of domestic demand appear
overly conservative. If the actual domestic demand indeed turns out to be
much higher than projected above, as seems possible, then the surplus left
for exports would be proportionately smaller.
Role of Brasov Plant
16.       Before 1970, the role of different domestic plants in supplying
bearings was not well defined. This often resulted in the same type of
bearing being produced at more than one location. Since there is a signifi-
cant economy of scale in the manufacture of bearings, such duplication was
clearly uneconomical. Therefore, an industry-wide rationalization program was
undertaken during 1971-75 plan period (described in more detail in Annex 2.1).

As a result of the rationalization program, Brasov plant was made responsible
for producing all needle and cardan bearings to be produced in Romania (needed
for transmissions in transportation vehicles), double-row radial-axial and
self-aligning radial ball bearings as well as some sizes of the single-row
radial and radial-axial ball bearings (needed by a wide variety of consumers,
but especially in electric motors and generators) and also some of the tapered
roller bearings (needed in some technological equipment).
17.       As a result of this division of labor, Brasov plant would be supply-
ing about one-third of the bearings to be supplied by Romanian bearings in-
dustry to the local market. Annex 4.3 shows the quantity of bearings to be
supplied by Brasov plant to the various sectors of Romanian economy. The
proportion of bearings supplied by Brasov would be slightly higher than one-
third of the bearings to be supplied by the bearing industry in Romania.
Distribution
18.       CIROA, the Central which controls the bearing manufacturing plants
in Romania, also has a warehousing enterprise known as BAZA. This enterprise
maintains warehouses at each of the plants as well as six regional warehouses.
It is obligated to maintain three-month supply of bearings at these locations.
19.       BAZA deals directly with the large consumers in Romania, supplying
them with the agreed quantity of bearings from its warehouses near the bearing
manufacturing plants. The smaller consumers are dealt with through numerous
state-owned retail outlets. BAZA supplies these retail outlets with bearings
from its decentralized regional warehouses.
20.       The quantity, type and quality of bearings to be distributed to
various consumers is determined by the technical service unit of the BAZA,
located in Bucharest. This unit receives all the requests from the original
equipment manufacturers and negotiates and allocates to them bearings of
specified type and quality within the general context of the five-year plan
and the availability of these bearings. This allocation becomes the annual
distribution plan. This service unit also offers technical assistance to
the consumers for selecting the right type of bearing for their application.

EXPORT MARKETS FOR ROMANIAN BEARINGS
A.   Estimated World Market
1.        It is estimated that in 1973 shipments by bearings manufacturers in
the world totalled approximately US$7 billion (excluding in-house production
of some large bearing consumers) as indicated below:
Estimated World Production of Bearings in 1973
Total World                          US$7.0 billion

Market-Oriented Economies            US$4.5 billion (64%)
(Of which 7 largest producers -  US$3.7 billion)
2.        The largest producer of bearings is the US where, in 1973, bearings
companies recorded shipments of approximately US$1.4 billion. 1/ The growth
in bearings shipments between 1960-73 in the seven largest producing coun-
tries that accounted for over 80% of production outside centrally planned
economies, is shown in the table on the following page. Production in these
countries increased from US$1.4 billion in 1960 to $3.7 billion in 1973 (in
current prices) at an average annual growth rate of 7.8%. However, between
1974-76 demand for bearings significantly softened in most developed countries,
including these seven major markets.

Japan has more than doubled its share as its production increased 450% during
this period (annual growth rate of 32%) and, in 1973, supplied about one-
fourth of all bearings in these countries. West Germany and France also
showed above average growth, while the U.S., Italy and Sweden showed below
average growth. As discussed below, a major factor in the Japanese industry's
growth has been its rapid increase in exports.
4.        World bearing production is highly concentrated not only by coun-
tries as discussed above, but also by producing companies. In centrally
planned economies, each country's bearings production is controlled by the
State basically through one holding enterprise. While in market-oriented
economies there are hundreds of producers, a few large multi-national com-
panies largely dominate the world production. For example, it is estimated
that SKF of Sweden, the world's largest bearings manufacturer, controls
between 30-40% of total world production outside centrally planned economies
through some 60 associate companies in about 20 countries. Timken Company of
the US accounts for another one-fifth of the world production and dominates the
market for tapered-roller bearings, as SKF does in the case of ball bearings.
In West Germany, the three largest producers account for 85-90% of total
output; in Japan, the four largest manufacturers produce about 90% of total
output; in France, 75% of production is in two companies; and, in the UK,
four manufacturers have 70% of the total market.
B.   Major Importing Countries
5.        In 1973, world trade in bearings totalled US$1.7 billion or 17% of
total production. As detailed in the following table, in that year North
America and Western Europe accounted for 62% of total world imports and
centrally planned economies about 12%. The US continues to be the largest
importer of bearings, with 1973 imports of US$142 million (12% of world
total); West Germany (US$100 million) and France (US$81 million) are the next
largest importers.
6.        Between 1967-73, total world imports grew 160% or at an average
annual growth rate of 17.5%. A significant part of this increase was due to
the increased penetration of imports in the two largest markets, e.g., Western
Europe where imports increased 208% and the US where imports increased 192%.
Amongst largest consuming countries, West Germany showed the highest increase
of 372% in its imports (from US$21 million in 1967 to US$100 million in 1973).
Most of the US imports are increasingly from Japan and Western Europe, without
substantial off-setting exports to these countries. The same is true for the
Japanese exports to Western Europe. But, a major reason for the increased
imports of individual West European countries is the rapidly rising trade in
bearings between them as many large multi-national producers with plants in
different countries of the region specialize production in these plants by
type of bearings and ship them across countries to satisfy the market demand,
instead of domestically producing most of the bearings needed in each country.
This trend is expected to continue in future.

C.   Major Exporting Countries
7.        Almost 90% of world export of bearings are by market-oriented
economies. In 1973, West Germany, with exports of US$280 million (50% of
domestic production) was the largest exporter and Japan a close second with
US$243 million (or 30% of production). As shown in the table on the next
page, these two countries plus the next three largest exporting countries (the
US, France and the UK) accounted for about 70% of world exports.
8.        IN 1973, total declared exports of centrally planned economies
(CEMA) were US$127 million equivalent, of which the USSR exports represented
US$69 million (55% of total). Romania's exports in that year were US$21.2
million (16.7%). It is estimated that about 60-75% of CEMA bearings exports
by value were between member countries. Since data made available to the UN
also indicates that total bearing imports by CEMA member countries in 1973
were US$142 million, it can be concluded that as a group these countries were
a net importer of bearings from market-oriented economies. This situation
may, however, be reversed in the next few years as major new production
facilities initiated in these countries since the early 1970s come on stream.
Romania's Export Markets
9.        In recent years, Romania has made concerted efforts not only to
substantially increase the volume but also to shift a larger proportion of
its bearings exports to market-oriented economies. As a result, exports
(by volume) to the latter were expected to increase from I million units (25%
of total) in 1965 to 27 million bearings (70%) in 1976, as total exports
increase from 4 million bearings in 1965 to 35 million in 1976. A major part
of this increase was achieved since 1973, as a number of product buy-back
agreements with Japanese, European and US bearings manufacturers came into
effect.
10.       However, the above analysis of exports of bearings by volume fails
to reflect the importance of export markets in centrally planned economies,
which have traditionally accounted for the major proportion of exports by
value. As shown in the following table, in 1968 these markets accounted for
86% of total Romanian exports by value. In 1973, these exports still repre-
sented 75% of total export revenues, though by volume exports to centrally
planned economies represented only about 38% of total 1/ because of the much
higher export revenues per bearings compared to the exports to market-oriented
economies. While this implied large difference in export revenue per bearing
is partly explained by the relatively lower prices probably offered for the
same product in the latter markets (due to the penalty for lower product
quality compared to the competition) and sales through other producers who
act as 'middlemen', it is also due to the significantly larger and costlier
bearings being exported to the centrally planned economies. On the other
hand, most of the bearings exported to market-oriented economies are 'com-
modity-type' bearings which are mass produced and have much lower unit price.
1/   These two figures may not be strictly comparable since they are derived
from different sources (mentioned in related tables).

11.       Exports to Centrally Planned Economies:  As mentioned earlier, it
is estimated that in 1973 bearings production in centrally planned economies
totalled approximately US$2.5 billion or about 1 billion pieces. By 1980,
the total CEMA bearing production is expected to rise to approximately 1.7
billion bearings, totalling approximately US$4 billion in constant prices
(annual growth rate of approximately 7%). At the same time, Romania's share
of total CEMA production should rise from about 3% to about 7%.
12.       Bearings trade between CEMA countries has recently been growing
at a fast rate and this trend is expected to continue in the near future as
these countries expand regional production, curtail imports from non-CEMA
countries and integrate this industry, as recently agreed, to achieve the
objective of regional self-reliance. CEMA bearings trade totalled Roubles
21.3 million 'US$27.7 million) in 1965 and reached a level of Roubles 81.9
million (US$114 million) in 1974, an annual growth rate of 16.2%. CIROA
expects this volume to grow during the next five years at an annual rate of
about 17% and reach Roubles 220 million 'US$286 million) in 1980. Brasov
has been assigned export targets in this general context.
13.       The responsibility of coordinating bearings production and trade
in CEMA countries rests with the Central Organization for Bearings Producers
and Consumers (OCIR). OCIR, after reviewing the market needs and production
plans of the member countries, prepares a five-year CEMA bearings trade plan
which specifies type, quantities and prices of bearings to be exported and
imported each year between member countries. These plans are then incorporated
into the bilateral trade agreements and are normally achieved without any
major changes. Based on OCIR's five-year plan for 1976-80, which coincides
with CEMA's current Plan period, CIROA has prepared Romania's export targets
for the next five years, as indicated in the following table. Romania's
exports to these countries are expected to increase from 8 million bearings
in 1976 to 12.2 million in 1980 (tentative target for 1985 is 18 million
units). Due to the type of bearings produced at Brasov, it will continue to
supply about half of total Romanian exports to CEMA members (6 million or 49%
in 1980 and 8.8 million or 49% in 1985).
14.       Exports to Market Economies:  Romania's exports to market-oriented
economies in 1976 were expected to total 27 million bearings, including 3.8
million from Brasov. By 1985, these exports are expected to increase 67% to
reach a level of 45 million (including Brasov exports of 7.7 million). While
the country would continue to seek increased exports to developing countries,
most of the planned increase would come through much higher sales in Western
Europe and the US.
15.       As already mentioned, the US is the world's largest importer of
bearings. Until recently, Romania had no bearing exports to North America.
However, in 1976, it reached an agreement with a US bearings manufacturer
under which the U.S. company would help Romania establish a new bearings
plant at Ploiesti and in return buy back Romanian bearings as payment.
The US manufacturer is expected to sell a part of this purchase in North
America, opening this important market to Romania. At the same time,

Romanian authorities are stepping up their efforts for direct sales to
bearing customers in the U.S., now that Romania has been given the Most
Favored Nation status.
16.       Western Europe is another large potential market for Romanian
exports. For a few years, Romanian bearings have been sold in small quan-
tities, both directly and indirectly, in West Germany, France, Italy and the
UK. Since 1973, leading Japanese and UK manufacturers have been offering
increasing quantities of bearings produced in Romania to their customers in
Europe. It is understood that agreements have been reached, or are under
consideration, which will substantially increase sales through these channels,
assuring that 60-70% of total Romania export targets for market economies.
These targets are achievable considering the size of the total market in
Western Europe. At present, Romania supplies a small proportion of total
bearing exports from CEMA countries to Western Europe. The total market share
of CEMA countries in this market is still small, as indicated in the table
below, and therefore Romania should be able to increase its sales, provided
adequate attention is paid to marketing.

The above table shows that in recent years bearings prices have risen slower
than the prices of other engineering products.  Actually, since the 1960's,



ANNEX 4-2
Page 11
the prices of bearings have risen much slower than the prices of other
machinery products or labor wages due to the major productivity improvements
in the industry. For example, in Germany, the bearings price index in April
1976 stood at 117.8 (1962 index = 100), that for machinery products 182 and
for labor wage rates 344. Similarly, prices of bearings in the US rose much
slower than other engineering products or the general price index. Since the
major bearings producers are currently implementing modernization and cost
reduction programs, it is expected than in the next few years also prices of
bearings will rise slightly slower than the prices of other products.

PRICING IN BEARINGS INDUSTRY IN ROMANIA
1.        Pricing system in Romania, as it applies to the bearings industry,
is described below. Both internal and external product pricing are discussed.
A. Internal Pricing System
2.        One of the basic objectives of internal pricing in the bearings
industry in Romania has been to provide inputs to the users of intermediate
products such as bearings at reasonable cost. In pursuance of that objective,
a general resetting of the prices of many of the bearings took place in 1963.1/
Since then, and until end-1975, there were three types of prices:
i)   Preturi de calcul or the "calculation price" (P );
ii)   Preturi de livrare or the "delivery price" (P )?
iii)   "Retail price" (P r).
3.        The relationships between these prices can be expressed by the follow-
ing inequality relationship:
P  <   P  < P
c      d      r
4.        The "calculation price" was the value that the producing entity re-
ceived and is also sometimes known as the producer price. This price was
set so as to cover production costs as well as to provide a profit margin
of about 10% on the costs. The costs included in such a calculation include:
i)   Steel
ii)   Other material such as brass
iii)   Energy
iv)   Labor
v)   Depreciation
vi)   Repair and maintenance
vii)   Other overheads, including interest on short-term borrowings
from banks.
5.        A graphical representation of these costs and prices is shown below.
1/   Not all the bearings which are now being manufactured, were being
manufactured in 1963. The prices of these new bearings were set
in the year their production started.

6.        No cost of investment funds received from the state budget was
included in calculation of costs (pre-1975) described above. By not
including a cost of invested funds in production cost, the pricing system
did not provide sufficient incentives for the efficient utilization of
those funds.
7.        The calculation price, mentioned earlier, is also the value at
which the bearings are transferred from the producing enterprise to the
Central's warehousing enterprise, known as BAZA. The "delivery price" is
the amount which BAZA charges its customers for the sale of bearings. As
stated earlier, the delivery price (paid by buyer) was higher than cal-
culation price (received by seller). The margin between the two not only
covered transportation costs and BAZA's expenses, but also provided an
additional source of funds for the State Budget. 1/
8.        The "retail price" is applicable to only a small fraction of bear-
ings. These are the bearings sold by retail outlets to consumers, e.g.,
car owners, for replacement. The margin between the retail price and the
delivery price covers the cost of the retail outlets and also provides
them with a profit margin.
Interim Price Changes in 1974
9.        Because of the objective of preventing price increases in the
economy, both the delivery and calculation price of bearings were kept
constant between 1963 and 1973. In the meantime, because of productivity
increases and economies of scale the production costs kept on decreasing,
thereby increasing the profit margin. In 1974, the calculation price
of some bearings was dropped as an interim measure in anticipation of the
general resetting of prices scheduled for 1976. This drop in price averaged
around 14% of the previous price. A schematic graph on the next page shows
the behavior of these prices and costs since 1963.
The 1976 Resetting of Prices
10.       As stated above, prices for most internally manufactured
products in Romania had not changed since 1963. In the meantime, because
of technological progress and world price trends, many of the prices no
longer reflected the cost of production. Therefore, in 1973, a new Law
(Law No. 19/1973) was passed. The Law modified the pricing system in two
ways:
i)   The calculation and delivery prices were to be merged
into a single wholesale price, at least for the bearings
1/   In some other industries the margin also contains turnover tax
and/or equalization (excess profit) tax, but not so in the bearings
industry.

industry. Thus the inequality relationship expressed
earlier in paragraph 3 is now as follows:
P   = P    c   p
c      d        r
ii)   A 6% tax on net fixed assets and working capital,
was to be introduced as a production cost element.
11.       Though the merging of calculation and delivery prices eliminates
a source of revenue to the State Budget, the introduction of the new tax
would compensate for it. 1/ Furthermore, the introduction of a new cost
item directly tied to capital utilization would provide an incentive to
utilize capital more efficiently.
12.       The resetting of prices in the Romanian economy has been phased.
It began in 1974 with basic raw materials such as fuel. Though the price
increases didn't become effective until later, information about the pro-
posed increases was passed on to secondary industries for recalculation of
their prices. The resultant recalculated costs for the bearing enterprises
were about 33% higher in 1976 than the prices in 1975, as summarized below.

13.       Based on the new costs, the enterprises calculated new end-product
prices which were then passed on to their customers. This process has now
been completed and the reset prices were to become effective on January 1,
1976. The following table shows the change in calculatioaZprices for some
representative bearings. For the industry as whole, average delivery price
decreased by approximately 18% and the average calculation price increased
by about 30%.

14.       For those bearings which are consumed internally but not produced
internally, local prices are determined by converting their dollar equivalent
import price at an exchange rate of 20 lei to a dollar. The consumers also
have to pay an import tax.
B.   Pricing for Exports
15.       Historically, the objective in pricing for exports has been to
lay stress on the achievement of volumetric targets. This has led to maxi-
mization of volume of exports but not necessarily the value of export.
In some cases, to meet the volumetric targets, the products have probably
been priced so low as to not even recover the fair foreign exchange cost
of imported components (such as steel in the bearings).
16.       Efforts are now being made to overcome this situation by:
i)   moving towards a pricing system under which all the im-
ported material will be priced by converting the foreign
prices at an exchange rate of $1 = 20 Lei; 1/
1/   This is already being done for all imported equipment.



ANNEX 4-6
Page 7
ii)   allowing exports at an implied exchange rate higher
than 20 Lei to a dollar only in exceptional circum-
stances, and after very careful analysis.
17.       For exports to market economics, standard foreign prices are devel-
oped based on international prices. The standard price in dollars is then
converted into Lei (PSL) at an exchange rate of $1 = 20 Lei. The Foreign
Trade Enterprise receives from the Equiliziation Fund an amount PFL given by:
PFL       =         PSL         -   PLL
where PLL is the local price of the product. This amount is constant, irre-
spective of the actual sales value of the bearings. The amount received by
the enterprise (PEL) largely depends on the actual sales value of the product
in dollars (PED) and is given by the following equation:
PEL       =        PED        *       20        -  PFL
Therefore if the actual price realized is the same as the standard price, the
enterprise gets the local price of the product.
18.       But if the enterprise finds market price going below the standard
price, it would ask for a downward revision of the standard price, and thereby
limit its downside risk. However, if the opposite happens, the enterprise is
under no obligation to ask for an upward revision of standard price. Because
of recognition lag, it takes about six months for the authorities to recognize
the shift. In the meantime, the enterprise enjoys above-average profit. This
in a way, gives the enterprises an incentive to increase efforts for exports.
The system described above can also be viewed as one in which there is an
implied exchange rate which is variable. This variable implied exchange
rate helps to insulate the local enterprise from long term price changes
in external markets. For the bearings industry, this implied exchange rate
for exports to the West is understood to have been 9.3 Lei to a dollar until
1974. However, with the relative decline in world prices of bearings, upward
revision of domestic calculation prices, and increasing difficulty in marketing
Romanian bearings, this rate has gone up.
19.       Exports to centrally planned economies (COMECON members) are at
pre-determined prices. These prices are fixed by the Central Organization
for Bearing Producers and Consumers (OCIR), on the basis of weighted average
of prices offered by all producing countries in COMECON. The relationship
between the local prices and the OCIR price is much nearer the average ex-
change rate for the whole economy; if the official exchange rate of 20 Lei to
a rouble was used, OCIR prices would be on average about 9% higher than
domestic Romanian prices.

Quality Improvement Objective
2.        The present quality of bearings produced at the Brasov enter-
prise needs overall improvement to become more acceptable in the world
market. Under the project, Brasov has set up a goal for quality improve-
ment as listed below:

3.        In addition to improving the tolerance quotient of the bearings,
Brasov also intends to improve the noise characteristics of the bearings.
This is necessary, for there are many applications where quiet smooth running
motors (e.g. refrigerators, hairdryers, etc.) are a must for a product to be
acceptable. The improved ball making machinery that gives better ball spher-
icity and roundness will be a major contributor in achieving this improvement.

Equipment Selection and Product Quality
4.        The quality of bearings manufactured is a direct function of the
equipment used to produce the parts. Since all bearing components after being
formed to preliminary shape must go through a heat treat process to improve
the wear characteristics and rolling fatigue properties, the final geometric
accuracy must be established in the grinding process. It is therefore axio-
matic that the equipment chosen must be able to work well within the required
tolerance limits to achieve final blueprint accuracy. Centerless grinding

machines are the most reliable machines available for high volume mass produc-
tion techniques. The minimization of tooling maintenance and the ease of
arranging for automatic load and unload permits the operation of this equip-
ment at high rates of output with self monitoring size controls known as
"in process" gages which can operate on an incremental or trend basis. All of
the equipment being proposed in the grinding department is some form of
centerless equipment and should help achieve the target quality levels.
Quality Improvement Under the Project
5.        The arrangement of the equipment also affects the final quality
of the finished product. The grinding equipment is to be layed out so that
there are a series of short lines that will transfer parts automatially
in sequence from operation to operation to a final automatic overcheck gage
that will pass good work onto assembly and divert bad into a staging area
for inspection review. With this type of continuous process, a malfunctioning
machine can be located in a very short time, to minimize the potential for
manufacturing defective components. All of this manufacturing "in process",
and "post process" gaging equipment will be continuously calibrated and
coordinated with high quality laboratory style equipment installed in micro-
laboratories on the manufacturing floor. Here parts will also be continuously
checked on a random basis by process inspectors and laboratory technicians in
the same micro-laboratories. These laboratories will be equipped with top
quality equipment for checking surface roughness, shape deviation, waviness
and dimensional integrity.
6.        Since the lines will be completely integrated in the Hi Volume
area, with the automatic "post process", gaging final inspection will be on
A.Q.L. 1/ basis for all products except precision classes which will be
checked 100% by hand. Non destructive tests for hardness, cracks, material
quality, retained Austenite, residual stresses induced by grinding will be
increased and modernized. The laboratories for monitoring fatigue and
wear characteristics will be expanded. Since this procedure is already in
operation at Alexandria and Birlad, the planned objectives should be met with
no difficulty.
7.        Roller quality will improve with the installation of an integrated
manufacturing process similar to the race grinding approach. Both balls and
rollers will be given a 100% visual check with specially designed "roll by"
visual tables. Automatic sorting machines will be used to classify rollers
into segregated diameter sizes.
8.        All bearings in the Hi Volume area will be assembled automatically
and then checked on automatic overcheck inspection equipment 100%, for length,
outside diameter, bore, radial play, run out and visual appearance by an
1/   Acceptable Quality Limit, determined mathematically on a statistical
basis from random samples.

operator running this equipment which operates automatically like the
assembly equipment. There will also be random spot checks for hardness,
residual magnetism and noise.
9.       Low Volume equipment lines present different problems from a
quality standpoint. When making antifriction bearing components there are
many factors other than actual measurable dimensional characteristics that
determine whether or not the finished components will be acceptable. The
grinding process today is still an art and not a science although great
strides have been made in recent years to change this outlook. In this
context, it takes long experience and great skill for an operator, set-up man
or foreman to ascertain just which particular component of a machine tool is
generating poor finish, bad geometry, noisy bearings or improper geometry.
In an "in line" system a machine that runs daily on the same part settles
into operation as the operator makes adjustment over a period of several
hours after a tool change and then runs days on a trouble free basis. A
Low Volume machine that receives a radical size change in parts will take
substantially longer to "settle in" (because so many additional variables
enter into the set up procedure) all the while potentially generating repair
or scrap dependent upon the operator's alertness. This effect cascades into
the set up and operation of each machine following the initial operation.
About the time the whole system settles down to producing consistent quality
parts, the production run is probably over and the whole chain of circumstances
is regenerated on a different part.
10.       Despite all of the above mentioned problems, the new Low Volume area
will run at a better quality level than it now operates at because the late
model grinding machines accept change more readily and depend less on the
skill of the operator. The machines are better designed thereby holding
closer tolerances running trouble free with minimum maintenance over longer
periods of time. The same sophisticated inspection equipment being fore-
casted for use in the micro-laboratories will be available for use on the
Low Volume equipment. "In process" gages will be used on Low Volume equip-
ment together with some "post process" gaging for longer runs. All of
the above factors will help to improve the overall product quality. As com-
pared with similar plants around the world, the quality structure is expected
to be as shown below.

11.       In the Hi-Volume area, with the installation of ultra modern equip-
ment Brasov's overall quality level will probably surpass most western plants
that do not make substantial new capital investments. The Japanese, however,
are an exception to this for in recent years they have made large capital
expenditures in modern equipment and the quality of the bearings they produce
is very high. In the Low Volume area at the higher quality sphere, entrenched
skills will offset the impact of sophisticated equipment for a period of time
and the Romanian quality will perhaps lag behind in this sector.
Quality Control and Maintenance
12.       The Research and Design Center has a staff with well-equipped
central laboratories, who will monitor the operation of the plant quality
people and micro-laboratories on an audit basis and a continuing load test of
bearings against standards to insure that there is no deviation from standard.
13.       The presence of well equipped micro-laboratories that can diagnose
quality problems early will aid considerably in raising the quality level on
old equipment. The high level quality output is dependent on rigid standards
of maintenance for all processing and gaging equipment. Operating foremen
as well as maintenance foremen should have a good solid understanding of the
elements that contribute to the proper operation of each machine that they
are responsible for. They should learn to anticipate wear and what can be
done on a preventative basis to keep equipment operable.
14.       All of the above factors are expected to result in an overall
improvement in the quality of bearings manufactured at Brasov.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.   Scope and Objectives
1.        The basic objectives of the project are fourfold:
(i) Capacity Increase - to expand annual production volume (in
number of bearings) from its present level of 20.0 million
bearings per year to 33.5 million bearings per year in 1985. 1/
(ii) Quality Improvement - to increase the level of bearing quality
produced at Brasov from the present medium level (where about
45% of bearings produced are below normally accepted world
standards) to higher levels (where 10% are similarly classified
by 1985.)
(iii) Wider Range of Product Mix - To increase its production from
210 basic sizes (in 1975) to 340 basic sizes (in 1985), as
discussed in Annex 5.7.
(iv) Reduction in Cost of Production (Through Higher Productivity and
Other Means) - modernization of production processes and methods
of replacement of older machinery, coupled with a rationalization
of product mix and more efficient inspection method, will increase
productivity of labor and invested capital, and decrease consumption
of steel and other materials, with the end result of more competi-
tive cost of bearing production at Brasov in 1985.
B.   Brasov Project - its Relation to Romanian bearing Industry
2.        The project fits into the overall plan for.further rationalization
of the Romanian bearing industry by permitting a higher degree of specializa-
tion (and lower unit costs) in the other two major bearing plants - at Birlad
and Alexandria. The general distribution and concentration of bearing pro-
duction at major plants by size and category is indicated in the table below:
1/   Aside from this project, another section of the Brasov plant is also
expected to increase production of needle/carden and special bearings
from 10.5 to 19.5 making total plant capacity 53 million bearings per
year in 1985.

X = Factories which produce the respective bearing types.
The above indictates that the ball-bearing products to manufacture (from an
economic viewpoint usually the higher volume bearings) are designated for
Birlad and Alexandria plants - with many "small and medium lots" left for
Brasov.
4.        Increased specialization has long been accepted by the world
bearing industry as one key means toward achievement of lower unit costs.
The Brasov project assists in meeting such goals for the industry as a
whole.
C.   Location
5.        The location of the project is at Brasov about 200 km north-west
of Bucharest. (Please see map showing the location of the project in relation
to the other Bearing plants).



ANNEX 5-2
Page 3
6.        The plant site is relatively close to the main markets in Romania,
and the sources of important raw materials. The site is near the location
of a former farm truck factory where bearing manufacuring was started in
Romania in 1949. Presently a major farm tractor factory is located adjacent
to the plant site. About 90 km to the south is located another major in-
dustrial complex at Tirgoviste, for large scale production of machinery,
machine tools, a steel plant, and other industry.
7.        The present plant site is relatively large (over 300,000 square
meters) and already contains much of the space and the initial infrastructure
required for expanded and modernized bearing production. Items such as
services, roads, utilities, maintenance shops, laboratories, and other support
facilities can be expanded as required at less cost at Brasov than at most
alternative locations. The fact that much of the project is "modernization"
and replacement of older obsolete equipment also favor the present location.
D.   Project Design and Know-How
9.        Much of the know-how for design of the project results from ex-
perience gained by the Romanian bearing industry (represented by Bearing
Central and Design Institute) over 27 years of domestic bearing production,
with recent close collaboration with Japanese producers (Koyo Seiko) in
building the Alexandria bearing plant between 1971 and 1975, and modernizing,
developing, and expanding other plants (Birlad, Ploiest). The level of
know-how presently available in Romania is adequate for design and implemen-
tation of the project.
E.   Components of Projects
10.       The project can be subdivided into two basic components:
Hi-Volume Component:
(i) Facilities for production of single-row radial ball
bearings to be manufactured in reasonably large
lot sizes (roughly 10,000 to 15,000 similar units per
line shift).
Low-Volume Component:
(ii) Facilities for production of other bearings in medium/small
production lot sizes.
These components differ primarily in their flexibility to be easily changed
from one size/type of bearing to another, material handling systems, storage
and flow coordination, and inspection processes. They are physicallly
separable in most, but not all, production operations (i.e. some operations
such as forging, heat treat, are common to both componnets).

G.   Quality
13.       Increased quality - one of the major objectives of the project -
will be obtained primarily by replacement of existing (older, fairly loose
tolerance) machines and production tools with newer machines able to achieve
close and more uniform physical tolerances. Also, modern "in-process" gauging
will more quickly detect and prevent further manufacture of, parts no meeting
established quality goals. Thus correction and salvage of substandard parts
will be reduced, making disposal of substandard bearings less common. Other
changes in timing (sequence), location, and standards of inspection techniques
will also contribute to more consistent achievement of higher quality levels
(Annex 5.1).



ANNEX 5-2
Page 5
H.   Costs
14.       It is expected that new machinery and production methods (and new,
more concentrated effort and attention on the part of management) will make
substantial improvements in productivity of labor under the project (see
Annex 5.8 for additional detail on labor productivity).
15.       Probably of greater importance than labor, an increase in producti-
vity of installed production facilities is also expected - especially in the
"high volume" line. This goal is expected to be achieved through automatic
loading/unloading of production machinery and more efficient process control
and inspection techniques.
16.       Other savings in cost of production will result from smaller metal
losses in turning, grinding, and reduced generation of scrap - with resultant
reduced specific consumption of steel/Kg of finished bearing produced of about
3 - 1/2%.
I.   Services and Support Facilities
17.       Power - Future total requirements for electric power at the Brasov
plant are estimated as follows (1985 level):
Existing
Needs    Additional Needs    Total
Installed power, Kw                 56500         735000           130000
Absortive Power, Kw                 17000          23600            30600
Consumed Energy Kw hr/yr.    90,315,000   101,685,000         192,000,000
These requirements are included in the five year plan for the Romanian power
sector and - now the technical/economic indicators for the project are
approved by the Government - must be supplied to Brasov under the law. Al-
though short term power limitations are always possible, Brasov, being a
relatively-important industrial user, could expect to get high priority
during any temporary shortage of power.
18.       Other utilities and services, including natural gas, oxygen water,
compressed air, steam, sewers, are supplied by the state and/or Brasov's own
facilities. The Brasov plant has an unusually high capacity for maintenance
and repair - with extensive well equipped maintenance shops and also substan-
tial shop capacity (staffed by a work force of 450 men) to manufacture its
own production machinery such as the more simple grinders, lathes, and ball
making machinery utilized in the plant.



ANNEX 5-2
Page 6
19.       In general, provisions for utilities and services, including
laboratories, inspection and test equipment, tool rooms, auxiliary shops,
foundry, storage areas, health food, administration are judged to be gener-
ally adequate to handle the requirements under the project.
J.   Product Design, Engineering, and Application
20.       The annual production plan of Brasov is reviewed periodically
by the Brasov Central (and foreign trade enterprises) - which may add new
bearings or omit certain bearings from the production plan. The design of new
bearings for new applications and the designation of existing bearings for
various end uses, is the responsibility of the Design institute which may
decide-in conjunction with Brasov management, to manufacture a particular
bearing in Romania depending on volume, cost, national needs and other factors.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF PRODUCT MIX
A.   Importance of Product Mix in Project Formulation
1.        Like in many other engineering industries, the choice of production
process and the cost effectiveness of a bearings plant is greatly dependent
on the product mix to be produced in it. A bearings plant designed to pro-
duce only a limited size of similar bearings in large volume can be designed
to use production processes which use specialized machine tools, eliminate
most manual operations through the use of mechanical handling of in-process
materials and automatic loading and unloading of machines. This not only
dramatically reduces skilled labor needs but also, and perhaps more im-
portantly, substantially improves equipment utilization and product quality.
On the other hand, a bearings plant obliged to produce a large variety of
bearings in relatively short average runs has to use flexible and there-
fore general purpose machine tools and also can not employ modern automatic
material handling equipment due to the need for frequent change-overs. Such
plants tend to have relatively higher production costs due to much higher
skilled labor needs, and lower equipment uitlization. Most new bearings
plants currently under development in developed countries are based on high-
volume production techniques. It is therefore, important to review the
proposed product-mix of the Brasov Bearings Project.
B.   Industry Product Mix
2.        In 1975, Romania consumed about 47 million bearings of some
6,000 different series numbers 1/. Of these, about 41 million bearings
consisting of some 600 series numbers were supplied from domestic produc-
tion (total local production was 71 million pieces) and the balance
6 million pieces (costing about $6.0 million) of about 5,400 series
numbers were imported. By 1980, total domestic consumption of bearings
is expected to rise about 32% to 62 million bearings, including imports
of 15 million bearing costing approximately $15 million, if the product
mix of domestically produced bearings remained unchanged.
1/   The same size and type of bearing can have many different types of
seals, cases etc. resulting in many series numbers for the same basic
size number. The exact number of different sizes of bearings used in
Romania is not known but is reportedly a fraction of the 6,000 differ-
ent series numbers used.



ANNEX 5-7
Page 2
3.        Under the Government's instructions, CIROA is making plans to widen
the product mix of domestic production from current 600 series numbers to
about 900 series numbers in 1980, in order to reduce expected imports by half
to about $6.0 million per year. The proposed expansion project at Brasov has
been designed to achieve partly this objective.
C.   Brasov Enterprise Product Mix
4.        Brasov enterprise currently produces about 30 million bearings in
312 different series numbers. After its current expansion program is completed
and reaches full production in 1985, Brasov is expected to produce 53 million
bearings in 428 series numbers as summarized below:
Comparison of Brasov Product Mix by
Series Numbers in 1976 and 1985
------- 1976-------    ------- 1985--------
Total    Total Series    Total    Total Series
Volume     Numbers         Volume     Numbers
Group I (Single Row Radial Ball)   15,600           133         15,434       176
Group II (Double Row Radial Ball)   2,500            55         3,300        45
Group VI (Needle, Cardan)              9,300         61         18,766        81
Group VIII (Tapered Roller)            2,600         63         14,000        92
Group VIII (Special)                     -           -             707       30
Group X (Transmission)                   -          -            1,500         4
Total                      30,000        312         53,000       428
This change in product - mix will be achieved by retaining 215 of
the 312 series numbers presently produced, dropping the other 97 series num-
bers and adding 213 new series numbers. Many of the bearings whose produc-
tion is being discontinued at Brasov will no longer be produced in Romania
since their consumption is dropping because they are primarily required in
replacing bearings used on old equipment and are not used on new equipment.
Actually, about three fourth of series numbers being discontinued at Brasov
are variations of basic sizes which would continue to be produced, and thus
the market needs would still be met through domestic production, though
this would require some adjustments on part of the users. The basic sizes
being dropped at Brasov are produced either at Birlad or Ploeisti plants.
On the other hand, of the 213 new series numbers being added 80% or 169
bearings are entirely new sizes. Since the product mix in terms of basic
bearing sizes rather than bearing numbers has a greater impact on produc-
tion process choice and on production costs, it is more useful to review
the changes in the numbers of different sizes to be produced.
5.        In 1976, Brasov's production plan anticipated producing 210 basic
bearing sizes. After the expansion project, the enterprise proposes to
produce 3-5-basic bearing sizes, as summarized below:

6.        The Government has agreed to review the product mix of the expansion
program since the appraisal mission's analysis indicated that the proposed
product mix would result in relatively short production runs and thus cause
low equipment productivity and high production costs.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
LABOR AND WORK FORCE
1.        In 1975, Brasov's permanent full time work force for the high and
low volume components of the project was 6,280 for a production level of
20.0 million bearings (Attachment I). Under the expansion project, Brasov's
management expects the work force to increase to 7,325 (Attachment II) for
a production level of 33.5 million bearings per year (for both project com-
ponents). Brasov's total work force for all operations is expected to be
8,553 of which 450 are to be assigned to the production of special machinery
in the new machine tool shops which are now being completed, and about 793 to
the needle, cardan and special bearings section.
2.        It is difficult to make meaningful comparisons of labor productivity
before and after the expansion project due to:
(a) a substantial change in product mix - involving a 438%
increase in production of roller bearings as compared
to a 68% increase in total bearing production under
the project;
(b) increased average size and weight of bearing produced;
and;
(c) significant improvement in product quality.
3.        In any case, major changes in production processes and methods
(especially automated assembly) will result in major gains in labor prod-
uctivity in production of high volume single row ball bearings; smaller,
but important, relative gains will be achieved in production of low volume
bearings through improved post process inspection techniques (more responsive
machine quality control), more efficient material handling and storage, and
control of inventories.
4.        Although the planned changes in work force under the project do
indicate substantial gains in overall labor productivity, it is felt that
even more improvement is reasonably attainable, as described below.
5.        The Brasov organization is showing commendable effort in their
attempt to reduce labor in the ball shops, roller grinding area, inspection
assembly, and wrap and pack. But, the manpower assignments shown on the
floor plan layouts for primary machining and grinding shops indicate these
to be potential areas for cost reduction.
Overall Comparison of Brasov's Labor Needs
6.        A global, overall comparison of Brasov's work force with other
bearings producers is given in the following table. Due to factors stated,

l6 figures given above are to indicate orders of magnitude only. The various plants are not
strictly comparable with respect to some basic characteristics such as product mix, size and
weight of bearing, quality grades produced, stage of development of plant expansion, outside
services and supply, etc. Also, some components (balls) may be purchased from outside sources
in some cases, as opposed to manufactured in plant in others.
However, the figures serve as a strong indicator that Brasovfs presently projected work force
does merit additional review.

the results of the comparison can be used only as a general indicator. How-
ever, even with due recognition of these factors, there is still a reasonable
indication that Brasov's work force is high by world standards. Review of
this information gives the impression that Brasov is overstaffed, even
under projected 1985 operating conditions, and a thorough review of its labor
needs is justified.
Other Comparisons
7.        The following table presents an analysis of direct labor man hours
per bearing for high and low volume components:
--------Plant Facility--------
High
Volume      Volume        Total
Direct Labor Man Hours            1,164,000   7,509,000    8,673,000
Number of bearings
produced in 1985                  5,500,000  18,000,000   33,500,000
Man hours/bearing                   0.212       0.268        0.259
The above shows that Brasov plans to use 1.26 times as much labor to produce
a bearing in the low volume area as it does in the high volume area. In both
cases, the labor differential does not appear in line with the expected output
at different bearing manufacturing plants throughout the world. Usually the
bearings produced with low volume methods and equipment require about three
times as much labor as high volume bearings. The largest difference appears
to be in the planned needs of the Hi-Volume component. In absolute terms,
in one highly automated plan in North America where only taper bearings are
made, .045 man hours per bearing are required in 70 different sizes. In
America, one plant producing ball and taper bearings together requires 0.075
man hours per bearing in 15 different sizes. In Japan, a plant that mixes
taper and ball bearings in different sizes requires 0.080 man hours per
bearing.
Potential for Improved Productivity
8.        Hi-Volume Component:  From the above figures, it is apparent that
the forecast labor for the manufacture of the ball bearings in the high
volume area is high. Because various combinations of a particular size are
going to be processed through the same equipment, a 20% penalty over the
highest number indicated above would be in order. This would indicate that
a more appropriate average number of man hours to produce a bearing in this
area would be about .096.
9.        Low-Volume:  Labor requirements in the low volume area also appear
high, for even this area will be semi-automated under the project. It does,
however, have a far greater mix of bearing types and sizes than the plants



ANNEX 5-8
Page 4
mentioned in North America and Japan, but a serious study effort should be
applied to see if further labor economies can be accomplished here. It
would appear, as a rough approximation only, that a 15% reduction in this
area as attainable resulting in a new target of 0.228 man hr/bearing.
10.       Revising the table shown at the start of this section to the
parameters indicated above, it becomes:
----------Plant Facility-----------
High           Low
Volume        Volume           Total
Direct Labor
Man hours                    528,000       6,384,000       6,912,000
Number of bearings
produced in 1982           5,500,000      28,000,000      33,500,000
Man hours/bearing                0.096           0.228          .206
11.       The above rough analysis indicates that a potential reduction in
direct man hours/bearing of about 20% should be attainable, leading to a
similar reduction in work force.
( 0.206          =   80%)
0.259
12.       The time to take advantage of labor savings in a revised plant
operation is when the equipment is first installed. Often, operational
inefficiency tends to absorb any labor savings that are not set out as
targets to be obtained in return for investments made in modern capital
equipment. If the expected savings are not clearly established as goals
at the beginning, it becomes much less probable that such gains will, in
fact, be achieved.
Initial Results
13.       The above indicates that savings in labor requirements of over
50% should be possible in the high volume area. Some reduction in labor
in low volume area should be possible due to partial mechanization of material
handling systems, lay out changes, reducing operator work stations, and other
improvements in work methods. Given the present high volume of manning at
Brasov, this reduction in work force could possibly reach 20-30%. However,
due to the very wide range of different types and sizes of bearings now
planned to be produced in the low volume area, it is difficult to state
without a detailed analysis, how much labor could actually be saved. More
accurate estimates can be made only after completion of comprehensive a
industrial engineering review.
General Conclusions
14.       The above overall review indicates that Brasov's labor require-
ment in 1985 could probably be reduced below the levels originally planned.



ANNEX 5-8
Page 5
These findings, and supporting specific examples for labor reduction, have
been discussed with Brasov. The Enterprise has initiated a comprehensive
review of its labor needs and now believes that it can reduce its labor
requirements at least 5% below its initial request. This review is expected
to be completed in March 1978 and discussed with the Bank.
Progres Made Recently
15.       Information received during negotiations confirmed that at the sug-
gestion of the Bank, Brasov has been exploring means of obtaining additional
labor savings under the project through more intensive use of industrial
engineering techniques and analysis. Over 200 permanent positions have been
removed from the "planned" future work force as a result of such efforts since
the time of appraisal.
16.       Management has agreed, during negotiations, to develop and staff an
industrial engineering group on a permanent basis for purposes of achieving
additional gains in labor productivity when the project is operational.
17.       Further labor reductions are expected to be achieved, to bring
Brasov's future labor productivity closer to that of other major bearing
producers.

ANNEX 5-8
Attachment III

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
POTENTIAL LABOR SAVINGS - RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL
ENGINEERING
I.   Case for Industrial Engineering
1.        The Bank staff believes that utilization of labor savings
methods and work practices at Brasov in the past may not have been given as
high a priority as some other plant objectives such as increased production
levels and improvement in product quality. This can perhaps be explained in
part by the relatively low cost of labor in Romania and technical difficulties
in justifying marginal additional expeditures in capital costs for purposes
of achieving reduced labor costs.
2.        However, the physical equipment to be installed in the proposed
expansion program - together with the likelihood of increases in real wages
in Romania in the long term - justify additional efforts to achieve savings
in labor costs and thereby improve the competitive position of the Brasov
Bearings Plant.
3.        It appears that the Brasov enterprise offers a good potential for
application of basic Industrial Enginnering approach and analysis. That is,
a systematic review and analysis of future plant and equipment layouts, basic
work methods, material handling including loading, unloading, storage of
material, mechanical handling devices, control of in-process stocks and
inventories, quality control and inspection methods, etc.
4.        The proposed review should be of a fundamental nature - seeking
primarily to find improved basic work methods which result in both reduced
labor requirements and, possibly more important, higher levels of equipment
utilization, resulting in a more competitive cost of production than is now
being assumed for the plant (at the expanded level of 53 milion bearings per
year).
5.        Other aspects of industrial engineering, such as more detailed
analysis involving precise time and motion study, work load analysis, pro-
duction standards, etc., could be implemented at a later date after the
general and fundamental improvements described in Attachment II have been
attained.
II. Recommended Procedure for Analysis and Review
6.        The recommended analysis should be done essentially on a separate
basis for each shop involved, i.e.



ANNEX 5-8
Attachment III
Page 2
(i)  Forging
(ii) Turning (machining)
(iii) Heat treat
(iv) Grinding
(v)  Finishing
(vi) Assembly
(vii) Packing
(viii) Roller Production
(x)  Others:  small lots, retainers, plain brgs, surface
plating, special brgs, tool-room, maintenance
shop, foundry, machine-tools shops.
7.        Overall coordination between individual shops would be required in
the analysis to cover certain aspects of:
(a) inspection (i.e., what is the most appropriate mix of
inspection and quality control at in-process
finished parts and assembly stages; would the
proposed in-process inspection gauges reduce
inspection workers in assembly, etc.)
(b) quality control
(c) production planning (i.e., production planning in indi-
vidual shops must consider optimiza-
tion of the whole plant's production
capacity)
(d)  inventory control (i.e., what raw material, in-process
goods and finished product inventory
levels would minimize the plant's
overall production costs; how can the
targeted optimum levels be actually
achieved; what benefits can be derived
through the proposed computer assistance,
etc.)
(e) assigned maintenance (e.g., can a greater amount of
planned maintenance be done on
weekends to reduce downtime during
working days)
(f)  general maintenance (e.g., can the maintenance labor costs
be reduced by performing more work
through general maintenance staff
instead of staff assigned to each
shop; can maintenance in different
shops be staggered to better utilize
maintenance staff)



ANNEX 5-8
Attachment III
Page 3
(g) other activities which affect more than one shop or
production area, as suitable.
8.        For each separate shop/operation as indicated above, the basic
work methods would be reviewed and analysed in detail first, followed by a
review of the minimum necessary work force associated with the chosen produc-
tion method in each area. The separate operations hould be analysed to
estimate possible reduction in workforce that could be achieved in the follow-
ing types of area:
(1) direct machine operators and operating crews
(2) loading and unloading personnel
(3) material handling between production units
(4) expediting and follow-up personnel
(5) product identification and inventory control
(6) dispostion, and prompt application or scrapping of rejected
work
(7) production planning - including quantitative effects of
frequent changes in size and type of bearing (set up time)
9.        The proposed analysis for evaluation of potential labor reduction
at Brasov would begin with an analysis of the proposed distribution of labor
for 53 million bearings/year capacity. Each major area would be subject to
review and possible reduction, and a new distribution developed to show the
end result and overall reduction in workforce which could then serve as a new
"target workforce" for the expansion project.
10.       In most cases in industry, it can be expected that efforts to reduce
manning levels will meet with numerous objections at several levels in the
organization. Efforts to reduce manning levels and improves equpment produc-
tivity here can only be successful if Brasov's top management actively follows
up and develops further the rough ideas and initial suggestions of the in-
dustrial engineering group. The degree of success will be directly related
to the receptiveness of Brasov's management to initiate active efforts aimed
at implementing such changes.

TRAINING OF PERSONNEL
Training Programs at Brasov
1.        The training of personnel at Brasov is well organized.  The
responsibility of training workers in necessary skills rests with the
Personnel Department which runs a large training school located next to the
Brasov plant. As described below, while the training school plays a key
role in imparting necessary skills to the potential labor force (largely
recruited from rural areas), other institutes like vocational schools and
engineering faculties run by the National Government provide trained
supervisors and skilled technicians.
2.        Hourly workers for various types of operator skills must have a
minimum of 11 years of formal schooling before getting recruited into the
plant work force. Those who lack either ability or desire for such formal
school start in on lower skilled jobs. They are required to attend the
training school a minimum of 180 hours per year for three years before
their formal training is completed. Under the on-job training, trainees
spend up to eight months with a highly skilled operator learning how to
properly run complex machinery.
3.        Skilled workers in certain categories such as apprentice tool
makers, machinists, electricians are given an additional year's training at
a vocational school after the training school at Brasov, before they enter
the plant. During the first year of plant assignment, they spend half day
in the plant and half day in school. The second and third year of their
apprenticeship is spent working in the plant during the day and attending
school in the evenings.
4.        Associate degrees for skilled technicians (who handle low level
engineering assignments) are granted to workers who go to a training
institute for an additional three years (or four years if night courses
are taken). About 35% of secondary school graduates take this extra school-
ing. After such training, workers are normally designated to become tool-
makers, draughtsmen, junior designers, foremen and shop technicians.
5.        Line supervisors in the operating departments are chosen from
skilled set-up people and operators who demonstrate superior ability.
Before they are given actual supervisory assignments, they are sent to
school for suitable training courses.
6.        Full engineering and economics degrees are granted to students
who go to the university a full five years, after they complete their 11
years of primary and secondary school. About 5% of the secondary school
students take this training. This group is also exposed to planning,

accounting and various administrative functions to prepare them for eventual
management and supervisory functions. After completing their degree course,
the graduates join enterprises such as Brasov as engineers, accountants,
economists, etc. and can ultimately become managers.
7.        In addition to the above relatively long formal training schemes,
Brasov also uses a variety of other training programs to continuously up-
grade workers. Young people in all groups are rotated in their assignments
periodically and all skill levels are required to attend courses developed
by the management to increase their knowledge and proficiency as the state of
the art changes.
8.        Overall, the training process is well conceived and executed.  The
management appears serious about the value of training to the growth of the
organization. Detailed discussions with members of Brasov's technical and
operating staff indicate a high level of competence. Young people undergoing
training appear alert and knowledgeable. The scope of subject material
covered in most courses compares favorably with that used for training hourly
workers in developed countries.
Training Program for the Project
9.        Under the proposed project, new production processes and much im-
proved product quality would be introduced at the same time that major in-
creases in production volume are to be achieved. The enterprise seems aware
that it is important to put strong emphasis on adequate worker training in
order to achieve project objectives. The personnel department is preparing
a detailed training program to ensure that all necessary skills are supplied
on time. Under this program, various training schemes mentioned above will
be utilized. Particular attention is being paid to the plans of the training
school at the plant.
10.       Detailed needs of different types of employees to be trained during
1975-80 period, after considering normal turnover as well as planned increase
in number of employees, are given in table below:

11.       At least fifty percent of the people trained will be workers
already within the enterprise who will be given training so that they go
onto higher skill level jobs in the plant.
12.       The general approach adopted by the Brasov enterprise is good.
The philosophy of training people for the more demanding skills such as
laboratory technicians, junior engineers, draftsmen in an organized school
by people who understand the needs of students, is very effective. This
type of training for lower level management develops more rounded skills
and invites the participant to make good use of the training to further
enhance his position in the organization by additional training at a
later date. The same type of training can be obtained in the plant
operating atmosphere. But too often those people who are capable of
training new help are so burdened with their own problems that the only
true knowledge a new man picks up is what he learns by observation and
repetition. Brasov is trying to avoid this problem.
13.       For workers on the operating level, the philosophy of allowing
a new man to spend up to 8 months as a working assistant to one of the
better workers is excellent. The top workers in a group usually have
good attitude and have picked up additional skills of which the foreman
is usually not aware of. The other facet of encouraging workers to move
from less challenging jobs to more difficult assignments gives the plant
much more flexibility, and helps to proliferate improvements conceived by
the operators who also understand the impact of one department's operations
on another.
14.       By and large, the overall training plan outlined above is consid-
ered adequate for the project.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT
1.        During appraisal, all basic aspects of ecology and plant working
conditions were reviewed with project sponsors. Reasonable attention has
been given to the environmental aspects, considering the present phase of
development of the project. The main points of interest are mentioned
below. Attachments I, II and III specify measures contemplated to reduce
noise, smoke and oil fumes in key plant areas.
A.   Liquid Effluents
2.        Liquid effluents are not expected to pose a significant problem,
as the major volume of effluents (such as cutting and lube oils, coolants
and water emulsions) will be continuously recycled and recovered in large,
automatically controlled, closed systems which include settling and skim-
ming, filtration, and magnetic separation and, in some cases, biological
inhibitors to prevent growth of bacteria. These systems result in neg-
ligible volumes of harmful liquid effluent for disposal outside of the
plant. Due to the process involved, any liquids which will result for
disposal from such systems are not expected to contain dangerous or highly
toxic chemicals. Such effluents will be treated to comply with applicable
Romanian laws.
B.   Noise
3.        (a)  Ball Shop:  Very high noise levels now exist in the ball man-
ufacturing shop (maximum permissble noise levels under Romanian legislation
for ball shops is 85 decibels. The present ball shop exceeds these levels
appreciably - with actual noise levels now approaching 96-99 decibels in some
cases.) The new and modernized ball grinding equipment included in the
project is expected to comply fully with Romanian legislation on noise, and as
a result noise levels in the ball shop will not exceed 85 decibels (at 1000HZ).
(b) The Forge Shop: The forge also has moderate to high noise
levels.
(c) Turning and Grinding Shops: Moderate noise levels exist in
turning shops and grinding shops.
4.        Steps being taken to reduce noise levels include redesigning of
basic machinery (specially new ball making machinery) to emit much lower
levels of noise from the machines themselves.



ANNEX 5-10
Page 2
5.        Noise reduction in the shops will also be attained through use of
thick sound-absorbing panels and irregular shapes to be installed, on walls
and ceilings of production shops, to absorb noise and prevent buildup of
noise from reflecting surfaces.
C.   Smoke and Oil Fog
6.        Moderate problems exist now in the turning shop due to smoke and
oil fog. New facilities are being designed with larger volume up-draft
ventilation systems designed to pull smoke and oil fog up from the floor
and away from machine operators, exhausting the fumes through the roof of
the building.
7.        Some expansion of the air conditioning and air filtration systems
will be introduced in areas where high levels of cleanliness are required
for product quality - such as some assembly, lubrication and final inspection
areas. A by-product of such improvements will be better working conditions
for plant workers.
D.   Solids - Disposal
8.        The volume of solids and sludge resulting from coolant recircula-
tion systems and other plant operations will be sold for recovery of contained
metals, or disposed of in waste dumping areas accepted by the Romanian Govern-
ment. Solids will not be disposed of in streams or rivers.
E.   Land Use - Effect on Surrounding Areas and Adjacent Land
9.        The plant site borders on another industrial plant (a large tractor
factory) and farm land with no residential or highly populated areas nearby
(for about 3 kilometers). The expansion under the project is almost com-
pletely contained within the present plant perimeter. The project's re-
quirements for additional land, butside the present perimeter of the plant
are less than 5% of presently occupied area (360,000 square meters), thus the
additional land requirements are relatively small. A small additional space
will be taken from vacant land now available between the Brasov Plant and the
tractor factory, immediately to the south.
General
10.       As is seen from the above, attention to ecology related matters by
Brasov has apparently stressed the in-plant working conditions and exposure
of plant employees to adverse environments, with slightly less attention to
the external effects of the plant on the surrounding area. This approach
is justified for Brasov's type of manufacturing operation, which includes
many machine and grinding operations, has a more limited effect on the out-
side environment than heavier industry such as steel and chemical plants. In
any case, the expansion of the Brasov plant is being planned with reasonable
artention to internal plant working conditions and effects of the plant on its



ANNEX 5-10
Page 3
related to ecology (air, liquid effluents, noise pollution) have been
very roughly estimated to be between 80-120 million Lei. However, such
estimates are subject to substantial error, for example, the basic reason
for including facilities such as coolant treatment systems may be for
economical operation of the plant and have only secondary effects on
ecology. Also equipment design modifications made to reduce noise
emanating from production machinery cannot be estimated with a high
degree of precision.
Legislation
11.       Romanian legislation applicable to the Brasov Project is available.
Under the force of the law, the Brasov enterprise will be made to comply with
.applicable Romanian legislation. The Bank has reviewed these standards and
they are expected to lead to the maintenance of high ecological standards in
the plant.

ATTACHMENT I
Measures to Improve Working Conditions in Turning, Grinding and Assembly Shops
Measures have been adopted according to the Republican and Depart-
mental Labour Protecting Norms of the Machine Building Industry. Due to the
increase of the number of machines and also of the shop areas, the following
steps are being taken to improve in-plant working conditions:
Turning shop:
-    extension and improvement of the building ventilation;
-    improvement of local ventilation in the tool dressing room.
Grinding shop:
-    isolation of secondary heat treatment shop from grinding shop
by a fire wall;
-    extension and improvement of the building ventilation;
-    extension and improvement of local ventilation in the washing-room,
where kerosene is used.
Assembly shop:
-    general air conditioning of the shop, according to the following
characterisitcs:
- temperature 22 + 2C
- humidity   50% + 5%
-    extension and improvement of local ventilation in the washing-
room, where kerosene is used.

ATTACHMENT II
Measures to Improve Working Conditions
in Forging Shop and Primary Heat Treatment Shop
The project was drawn up according to the Labour Protection Norms
in force. The shops would fulfil all the lighting and micro-clmiate condi-
tions. When putting the equipment into operation, all the departmental and
Republican labor protection norms in force, would be respected. Improve-
ments to be brought in the project compared to the existing situation are:
- shop height calculated to assure a good, natural ventilation;
- furnaces, heated with methane gas which produces smoke, dross,
noise, excessive heat, would be replaced in all possible cases by high fre-
quency current heating equipment;
- rotary converters, which serve the H F C heating equipment, will
be built in housings to eliminate noise, and at the same time they will be
placed in separate rooms;
- to eliminate excessive heat given out by furnaces, the remaining
ones will be provided with economizers;
- local ventilation will be provided for equipment which would
produce smoke and heat (e.g. grinders, deburring grinders and the welding
shop);
- the whole ventilation of the shop will be achieved by 4 ex-
changes per hour through input ventilation and fresh air inlets for the
aeroterms.

ROMANIA
BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
BASIS OF CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES
1.        The original data for capital cost estimates was provided by the
Brasov Enterprise which worked closely in conjunction with CIROA and Design
Center in developing facility plans, number of machines required, and related
costs. The estimates for machines and equipment included in the project were
based on a detailed equipment list which, in total, consists of approximately
616 groups of equipment, as summarized in Attachments I and II. Attachment I
lists equipment, not currently produced nor expected to be produced in the
desired quality in Romania during the project implementation period, which
Brasov Enterprise proposes to import. The Romanian authorities and the Bank
have agreed that these items will be imported from Bank member countries and
Switzerland, unless otherwise agreed to by the Bank, to ensure the project's
technical viability. Attachment II describes equipment, already manufactured
or expected to be manufactured in the near future in Romania, which may be
supplied from Romanian or foreign sources.
2.        The basic list of facilities described in the equipment list was
reviewed by the Bank staff and consultant, and:
(a) the plant's ability to produce the given product mix was
verified. The adequacy of proposed facilities was reviewed
in terms of capacity, quality, and production cost.
(b) subsequently, given the accepted list of facilities - unit
price comparisons for key equipment in the list were made
with West European, US and Japanese equipment manufacturers, on
the basis of actual early 1977 price levels.
3.        The original Romanian estimates were prepared based on comparisons
available to the Enterprise and CIROA (including two similar projects recently
completed) on prior purchases of similar equipment over the last one to five
years. The Bank reviewed these estimates and compared them with the informa-
tion mentioned in para. 2(b) above. Although considerable variations in unit
equipment prices were observed between various possible sources of supply --
often involving different degrees of sophistication in automation, machine
control systems and machine accessories -- the Bank staff concluded that,
while the local cost estimates were reasonable, the Romanian authorities had
slightly underestimated the base 1977 prices for imported equipment. This
judgment is based on reasonably full utilization of Romanian-made components,
efficient procurement under conditions of effective International Competitive
Bidding, and selection of machines and machine controls of moderate complexity,
suitable to Romanian conditions of moderate labor costs and maintenance capa-
bilities. Moreover, for imported equipment and supplies, the Romanian estimates
had not made an adequate provision for escalation between 1977 and 1981.



ANNEX 7-3

1977, 1978 and 1979          -   7.5%
1980 and 1981                -   7%
These escalation rates were applied to price estimates which were valid in
early 1977 (for delivery in late 1977), to arrive at Bank estimates. Final
results of these computations are shown in Annex 7-1. As a result of the
above-mentioned adjustments in the base 1977 costs and the escalation provi-
sion thereafter, the Bank estimate of the cost of agreed imports is US$31.5
million, compared to the original Romanian estimate of US$26.0 million.
5.        To confirm, the validity at the overall project costs, global cost
comparisons were made with certain on going bearing projects in the USA,
Western Europe and the Far East. These global comparisons can only be
utilized to make rough comparisons due to the following differences between
individual projects:
(a) Product Mix - different types, sizes, volumes and quality
of bearings are to be produced under each project, with
important effects on facility requirements, effective
capacity, equipment utilization, etc. (including number
of individual bearing numbers, length of production runs,
weight per bearing, etc.);
(b) Scale of Operations - differences in absolute volume of
production which can effect choice of process technology
and economies of scale.
(c) Other - such as differences in approach to estimation
of capacity - i.e. degree of conservatism in assumptions
utilized for average cycle times, equipment scheduling,
effective utilization of installed capacity, etc. Other
differences - such as new "greenfield" plants versus
expansion of existing plant, location, etc., could also
influence costs.
The Bank staff and their consultant believe that the differences in the
factors mentioned above could be recognized with sufficient accuracy to make
overall comparisons of reasonable accuracy. These comparisons confirm that
the estimated costs of the proposed project are reasonable.
6.        Civil Works and Construction:  The Construction Trust for Bearings
and Assembly Components will be responsible for all construction work under
the project. This is the same trust that built the original Brasov plant
and, recently, two other Romanian bearings plants. Costs of construction and
civil works have been estimated based on the added building area (number of
square meters), the specific type of buildings and foundations required, and
other relevant factors (such as particular equipment needs, alterations and
additions to existing structures, etc.). Official Romanian list prices for
various construction elements (like steel, cement and labor), combined with

ANNEX 7-7
Page I
ROMANIA
BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
1.         Procurement procedures to be utilized for the project are de-
scribed below:
(a) It is expected there will be 30 or more major bid
packages (Attachment I), some of which may be split
into additional smaller sub-groups as deemed appro-
priate.
(b) Suppliers for the bid packages will be pre-qualified
and the resulting list of the pre-qualified firms
will be reviewed and approved by the Bank.
2.        Procurement is expected to be divided into two main groups:
Category I - Direct Imports
(c) For this category, the Bank is expected to finance only
the costs of direct imports of machinery, equipment,
and services, and it is expected that only foreign firms
will be prequalified to supply these Bank financed bid
packages.
(d) The Bank will finance foreign exchange expenditures
for imported machinery, equipment, spares, and any
technical services, which may be necessary for
supervision of installation and start up of equip-
ment or setting up the proposed industrial engineer-
ing unit at Brasov.
(e) The Bank will finance 100% of the foreign currency
expenditures for eligible machinery and related
services.
Category II - Other
(f) In this category, it is expected that Romanian firms will
also be prequalified and participate in the bidding along
with foreign bidders for items to be financed by the Bank.
(g) The Bank will finance both foreign and local expenditures
for imported or Romanian machinery, equipment, spares, and
any technical services which may be necessary for supervision
of installation and start-up of equipment.



ANNEX 7-7
Page 2
(h) The Bank will finance 100% of foreign and local
currency expenditures for agreed imported and
domestic machinery and related services.
Disbursements
(i) The Bank loan would be disbursed against the cost
of agreed eligible categories of machinery, equip-
ment, services, as mentioned above. The current
cost estimates indicate that the proceeds of the
Bank loan would be fully needed by these eligible
categories. However, if some funds allocated for
expenditures under Category I above are not required,
all or part of that portion of the loan will be can-
called by the Bank.
Bidding Procedures
Category I - Direct Imports /1
(j) Only non-Romanian firms are expected to be pre-quali-
fied for packages to be financed by the Bank. One
stage bid procedure will be utilized for most
bid packages: initially invitations to bid will
be sent to prequalified firms, followed by prebid
meetings. Subsequently preliminary technical offers
without prices will be received followed by technical
discussions with bidders to achieve uniformity among
all bids to be submitted. Next, final technical bids
and firm priced bids will be received on a previously
agreed date and time. Priced bids will be opened and
read publically at the designated time on the same day
they are received. After this, selection of the lowest
evaluated bid will be made, and recommended for award.
The bid evaluation will be submitted to the Bank for
its review and agreement prior to notification of the
successful bidder. The bidder so designated would be
notified in writing before being invited to Bucharest
for discussions leading to a final contract.
(k) Each bidder will be asked to supply either an entire
equipment package, or designated parts of an equipment
package, together with services which may be required
for efficient installation and start up. Responsibility
for supply and performance guarantees will fully rest
with the successful bidder.
i/   Applies to individual purchases of over US$100,000 equivalent.



ANNEX 7-7
Page 3
Category II - Other /1
(1) Bidding procedures for this category would be similar to
those used for Category I, except that both foreign and
Romanian firms could be prequalified and participate in
the bidding for bid packages to be financed by the Bank.
Local Supply
(m) Local equipment (unless bid successfully under Category II)
will not be financed by the Bank, nor will civil works and
building construction, which will be executed by the Ministry
of Machine Building's Construction Trust "Enterprise for
Erection of Industrial Buildings". The Bank is satisfied that
the type of equipment specified to be supplied locally can
be produced in Romania to satisfactory levels of quality
within the time schedule required; and that the quality of
civil construction is adequate for the project.
(n) Responsibility for procurement will rest with the Brasov
Enterprise, assisted by the Brasov Central for all technical
aspects. Primary responsibility for commercial aspects of
procurement now rests with UZINE EXPORT IMPORTS, together
with five other foreign trade enterprises who will be
responsible for such aspects.
Implementation Schedule
(o) The expected timing of key events in project implementation
is given in Annex 6.1. This schedule calls for the receipt
of most bids between August 1977 and February 1978, with the
award of contracts to begin in January 1978 and mechanical
completion of the project in 1981; attainment of full pro-
duction is expected in 1985.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
REVENUE ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECT
1.        The revenue estimates are a function of two elements.  One is
the projected sales volume and the other is the projected sales price of
the different types of bearings to be manufactured at the Brasov Plant.
Each one of these elements is discussed below.
Sales Volume
2.        The projected aggregate sales plan by type of bearing, shown
in Attachment I, is based on both the market demand and the project imple-
mentation plan. The aggregate sales plan is further broken down by individ-
ual bearings to be manufactured after the first full year of production at
capacity (1985). A summary of this breakdown by size and type of bearings
is given in Attachment III. The split between different types of bearings has
been adjusted to conform with the available capacity for production. A
similar summary has been prepared for 1975, to enable an analysis of any
changes in the structure of sales which may be relevant for revenue estimation
(Attachment II). The use of this analysis is discussed further along with a
discussion of sales price.
Sales Price
3.        The pricing of bearing in Romania was discussed under Annex 4-7.
As described there, Romanian bearings prices were kept constant between
1963 and 1973. In 1974, as a part of the general resetting of prices,
there was an interim price adjustment of "calculation prices" (the prices
which are used for calculating an enterprise's revenues). After the
bearings industry had been informed about the resetting of prices of
all its cost inputs, the interim prices were revised as of January 1,
1976. These 1976 resetted prices have been used in calculation of
average prices for 1985. For comparison, the same 1976 resetted unit
prices have been used in calculating the 1975 average prices. These
average prices, shown below, are based on the structure of sales
exhibited in Attachments 1 and 2.

Total Project                46.4      49.2     +6.1%
4.        A comparison of average prices shows that:
(i)  average price for a high-volume type of bearing is
about two-thirds that of the low-volume type; and
(ii) between 1975 and 1985, the average price for a high-
volume bearing would increase by about 30%, but that for
a low-volume type of bearing would marginally decrease
due to the planned changes in product mix.
Revenue Estimate
5.        Using the weighted average prices and its trend, derived by a
detailed analysis of the product mix, and the sales plan of the Enterprise,
revenue estimates have been made for both the project and the enterprise.
These estimates are shown in Annex 8-3 (for the project) and Annex 8-4
(for the Enterprise).

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
OPERATING COST ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECT
1.        The estimates of operating costs are based on the production plan,
type and size of bearings, production process, learning curve for new pro-
cesses, and unit cost of various inputs like steel, labor and energy. Each
one of these elements are discussed below.
2.        The production plan for the enterprise is the same as the sales
plans, because the amount of finished goods inventory maintained by the
enterprise is very small (1-3 days production). This plan is shown in Attach-
ment I of Annex 8.1, and shows the build up operation at production. About
90% of the capacity is reached by 1982, the year in which the project is
scheduled for completion. By mid-1984, production at the rated capacity would
be achieved, with 1985 being the first full year of production at capacity.
3.        The size of bearing has a major influence on the cost of production,
since the cost of steel used accounts for over 50% of the cost of goods sold.
The cost of steel consumed is almost directly proportional to the size of
bearings being manufactured. Furthermore, larger bearings require larger
machines, normally more machine time and, therefore, more capital as well as
labor. As a result, an analysis of the relative weights of different types of
bearings is a fairly good indicator of the relative production cost of those
bearings as is shown in the table below.

product mix (1.0 million pieces in 1985).

between 1976 and 1985 is given in table below.

/1   Excluding depreciation and investment tax.
/2   Excluding textile bearings.
5.        For Hi-Volume type bearings the significant changes would be in
material and maintenance costs.  Because of a change in process between 1976
and 1985, the number of rejects would be dramatically reduced. This would
result in a small consumption of metal and therefore per unit cost of material
will increase only 8% despite a 39% increase in the average weight of bearings.
However, a more automated process also results in higher repair and main-
tenance cost, which would increase by about 30%. There would also be a small
increase in labor cost (about 7%) due to 5% per annum increase in wages, which
is partly offset by reduced labor requirements from a more automated process.
Overall the average production cost would increase by about 9% because of the
much higher weight of material cost in the cost structure.
6.        For Low-Volume type bearings, the major change would be in mainte-
nance and repair costs which on a per unit basis would be almost half of the
present value. This projected reduction would result from the modernization
of the low volume bearing production facility involving replacement of many
of the old machines by new ones. There would be a 6% decrease in material
cost due to improved equipment quality. There would be a 19% increase in



ANNEX 8-2
Page 3
labor cost due to the 5% per annum inflation in wages expected over that
period. The impact of inflation would be somewhat reduced by economics of
scale, especially for indirect labor. The 11% reduction in energy would be
due to some conservation measures expected to be taken by the enterprise. The
net impact of all these changes would be a 3% decrease in average production
cost.
7.        In projecting production cost between 1976 and 1985, the impact
of introducing a new process on the initial production cost, has also been
considered. The table below shows the probable cost impact of start up
problems and the learning curve.

Initially there would be large metal loss owing to production of larger
number of rejects. Also, the labor would be unaccustomed to working on
the new type of machines, resulting in much lower production per man hour.
These problems would be solved with the progress of time and the production
cost would stabilize at its normal long run average value.

BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
FISCAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT
A.   Introduction
1.        Traditionally, in project appraisal the Bank undertakes a financial
analysis of the borrowing enterprise along with an economic analysis of the
costs and benefits of the project to the country's economy as a whole. How-
ever, in many economies where the state plays a central role in economic
development, one of the major constraints on investment and economic develop-
ment is the availability of funds for investment from the state budget.
Therefore, in such cases, it is also important to analyze how the project
under appraisal would affect the flow of funds into and out of the state
budget. Furthermore, in many such economies, the financial viability of
borrowers, which are usually state-owned, is guaranteed by the state for all
practical purposes; in case the enterprise experiences a cash flow problem,
the state steps in with cash infusion to overcome the problem. In such cases
a financial analysis of the borrowing enterprise, for determining its ability
to service additional debt, becomes less relevant. This is especially so in
Romania where the state not only bears the ultimate risk and responsibility
of servicing foreign debt, but also has a policy of insulating its enterprises
from the impact of any such debt. Therefore, an analysis which measures the
impact of the project on State Budget, along with the Budget's ability to
service the debt out of its cash flow from the project, becomes more relevant.
2.        Such an analysis can be summarized in a fiscal impact statement.
Since the rationale for such an analysis is to measure the project's effect
on the funds available in State Budget, a cash flow approach rather than an
accrual approach has been used for preparing the fiscal impact statement for
the project. The main sources and applications of Budget funds are discussed
below.
B. Sources of Funds
3.        The Budget will have two major categories of sources of funds from
the project:
(i) operating surplus from project components, which would be
passed on to the State Budget under the Romanian system; and
(ii) disbursements from the Bank loan received because of the
project.
4.        Operating Surplus:  The funds received from the enterprise consist
cf five different categories. First, as required under the Romanian system,



ANNEX 8-10
Page 2
all the benefits (net income) would continue to flow to the State Budget.
For project components, the funds from this source would almost triple
because of the project from about Lei 183 million in 1976 to Lei 532 million
in 1985. Second, the Budget would receive funds from the depreciation account.
These funds will increase from Lei 75 million Lei in 1976 to about Lei 176
million between 1981 and 1983, before starting to decline again. The decline
would be due to full depreciation of some of the older machines. The third
source of funds from the project would be the temporary 6% Investment Tax on
fixed assets and working capital to be applied in 1976 only. Fourth, the
Budget would also receive principal repayments and interest payments on the
Bank loan on-lent by the state to the enterprise. The principal repayments
would start in 1981 after an initial grace period of three years. Since a
equal annual repayment of principal has been assumed, the funds from this
source would remain level at Lei 76 million until repayment of the debt. By
1991 all debt on-lent to the enterprise would have been repaid and funds flow
from this account would cease. And, finally, the project would make notional
interest payments on debt outstanding. The funds paid to the Budget under
this category would build up rapidly from nil in 1976 to Lei 53 million in
1982, gradually declining thereafter as the principal is repaid. The total
payments to the State Budget from the project components would more than
double in ten years, from Lei 323 million in 1976 to 743 million in 1985.
5.        Bank Loan:  The funds to be received by the State Budget from
foreign sources for the project components would consist of a US$38 million
(Lei 760 million equivalent) loan from the Bank. The actual flow of funds
from this source would start in 1977 and end in 1981.
C. Needs for Budget Funds
6.        The State Budget has to make allocations of funds to the project
and to foreign lenders. The allocations to the project are under three
accounts. First, the state would contribute almost Lei 1.58 billion for fixed
assets, between 1976 and 1981, at an average of about Lei 263 million Lei per
year. Second, the state would also compensate the enterprise any funds
needed for interest during construction on foreign loans. These would amount
to Lei 106 million over a five-year period between 1977 and 1981. Third,
the state would provide funds for incremental working capital needs due to
the increased production level, totalling Lei 178 million over a nine-year
period from 1977 to 1985.   Finally, Lei 252 million would be received by BAZA
Warehouse Enterprise for its additional working capital needs.
7.        From the State Budget, funds will also be needed to repay foreign
debt acquired for the project. The outflow from the State Budget for interest
and principal repayment would begin in 1981 and reach its maximum level of
Lei 129 million in 1982.



ANNEX 8-10

D. Net Flow of Funds - Fiscal Impact Statement
8.        The above contributions to and payments from the State Budget
for the project components are summarized in Attachment I (with the proj-
ect) and Attachment II (without the project). After project's completion
completion in 1982, the net incremental funds flow from the project is
positive in all years and is projected at 236 million in 1985. The net flow
of funds from foreign sources is positive in the beginning until 1981, but
becomes negative after that as the principal repayments start (disregarding
export revenues). The total net flow of funds (domestic and foreign) from the
project components is also always positive. The debt service coverage by the
funds from the project components is also very comfortable and would remain
above 4.8 times, the lowest level projected for 1982. In short, the project
would have a positive impact on the Government's fiscal budget.

ROMANIA
BRASOV BEARING PROJECT
CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS
Benefits
1.        As described earlier the project proposes to expand the production
capacity for ball and tapered roller bearings from its present level of 21
million bearings per year (though 1976 production was 20 million) to a level
of 33.5 million bearings per year, by the end of 1982. The project would also
modernize the existing production facility so as to improve quality. The
improvement of quality would also have secondary benefits insofar as it would
help to improve the quality and competitiveness of Romanian machinery and
equipment.
2.        To quantify the value of increased production shadow prices for
bearings have been used for bearings consumed within Romania. These prices
have been set equal to the price or the cost of the cheapest alternative to
increasing the bearing production capacity. Since the bearings are a very
important component of machinery and equipment, the cost of not consuming the
bearings would be too high; such an alternative has been rejected. The other
alternative would be to import bearings; either from the COMECON countries or
from the West. Since the price of bearings from COMECON countries is cheaper
than that from the West (using a cross shadow exchange rate for Romania of
US$1 = 1 Rouble) and also because Romania has a surplus in its trade with
COMECON countries and a deficit in its trade with the West; the least cost
source would be the COMECON except for about 1 million bearings which would
have to be imported from other sources since they are not available from
COMECON sources.
3.        Therefore COMECON prices have been adopted for shadow pricing
internal consumption of bearing to be produced under the project, except for
1 millin bearings which are priced at estimated import prices from Bank member
countries.   A comparison of the Romanian local prices with prices used in
COMECON trade (also known as OCIR prices) shows that OCIR prices are on the
average 9% higher than the official Romanian prices (Annex 4-7). Therefore
the shadow prices chosen for bearing production consumed locally are 9% higher
than the official local price. The bearings for export to the East are also
priced at OCIR prices and those to the West at their price in West less
selling cost (or 9-10% less than domestic prices). The following table shows
average base shadow price by destination and by bearing type.

excluding 7 million textile bearings.
/3   Converted at 20 Lei = 1 Rouble
/4   Converted at 20 Lei = US$1 and net of marketing costs.
4.        The benefit accruing from the improvement in quality can be quan-
tified as a premium of 5% on prices of Hi-Volume type bearings and 6% for
the Low-Volume type of bearings. The calculation of these premiums is shown
in the table on the next page.
5.        The table shows the distribution of bearings by their quality
level in both 1975 and 1985. The price indices show the quality premium
given for higher quality groups (i.e., P6, P5 and P4) when compared with
the lowest quality group (PO). The table shows that because of the shift in
distribution of bearings towards higher quality groups in 1985, the average
price index also increases. For High-Volume the average index increases
from 1.20 in 1975 to 1.31 in 1985. Though there is an 11 point theoretical
increase in quality premium, the OCIR price index will reflect only about
half that increase. This is because a) current OCIR quality is estimated to
be slightly better than present Romanian quality level; and b) due to a
general tendency in those countries to avoid price increases. The result
would be that the OCIR price index in 1985 would be about 5 points above that
in 1975, yielding a quality multiplier of 1.05. A similar analysis for
Low-Volume line is given in the table and the analysis shows an increase in
average price premium from 1.13 in 1975 to 1.27 in 1985. The OCIR price index
would again show only half the increase and will be at about 1.20 in 1985.
This yields a quality premium multiplier of about 1.06.

Costs
6.        Special steel prices have traditionally been very low in Romania.
With the 1976 resetting of prices the average price of special steel was
doubled from its original value of Lei 4,300 per ton to Lei 8,578 per ton.
Even with this resetting, the steel price is still about 22% lower than the
price of imported special steel in Romania. Since the imported steel does go
into the bearings, the price for economic analysis has been set at the cost
of importing the steel, i.e., Lei 11,000 per ton.
7.        Labor costs in Romania are low compared to that in the more indus-
trialized countries. The average wage after the recent price resetting would
be about Lei 2,200 per month (equivalent to about US$0.50 per hour) for
direct labor and about Lei 8,000/month for the indirect labor. In addition,
there is a social security payment by the enterprise to state amounting to
15% of wages and salary. Though these costs are low, the wages and salary
have not been shadow priced upwards because there does not seem to be any
shortage of labor.
Inflation
8.        The unit cost of inputs are expected to increase at a much faster
rate than the international price of bearings. This is because increased
competition in the international market along with some productivity gains
would prevent large increases in prices. It is expected that the unit pro-
duction costs excepting labor would increase at an average annual rate of 2%,
wages within Romania would increase at an average annual rate of 5%, whereas
bearing prices in COMECON transactions are expected to increase at only 1% per
annum.
Economic Rate of Return
9.        All rates of return are arrived at after deflating both costs and
benefits by the expected Romanian inflation rate of around 2% per year. The
project has been analyzed by dividing it into its two separable components.
One of them is the High-Volume line which involves setting up of a mass
production line for some sizes of the single-row radial ball bearings.
The other component is the modernization of the existing Low-Volume production
facility. The sensitivity of these returns are presented in Annex 9-2.
