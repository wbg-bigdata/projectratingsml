APPRAISAL OF THE BRASOV BEARINGS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the expansion and modernization project of
the Brasov Bearings Enterprise, Romania's largest and oldest bearings pro-
ducer, which will increase production from 20.0 million bearings in 1976
to 33.5 million in 1985, expand its product mix and substantially improve
product quality. The total cost of the project is estimated at Lei 1,755
million (US$88 million), including Lei 760 million (US$38 million) in direct
and indirect foreign exchange costs.
ii.       Since the inception of the Brasov plant in 1949, the Romanian
bearings industry has made rapid progress. In 1975, four domestic plants
produced about 71 million bearings valued at approximately Lei 1.9 billion
(US$95 million), of which nearly one-third were exported. Substantial
changes have taken place in the industry since the late 1960's, when the
Government invited Koyo Seiko, a major bearings manufacturer in Japan, to
help establish large modern production facilities at Birlad and Alexandria.
This was part of a major expansion and rationalization program designed to
improve industry efficiency by introducing the latest production processes
and increasing product specialization among different plants. After the
completion of Brasov's proposed expansion and modernization, the basic
objectives of this rationalization program will have been achieved.
iii.      Overall, the Romanian economy -- particularly the industrial sec-
tor, which is the main consumer of bearings -- has been growing at a very
high rate. As a result, consumption of bearings in Romania over the last
25 years has increased from 0.4 million pieces in 1950 to 46.6 million in
1975, representing an annual growth rate of 20%; though, since the early
1960s, growth has slowed somewhat to an average of between 12-15%. Demand
for bearings in Romania is likely to continue expanding rapidly in the fore-
seeable future, though somewhat slower than in the recent past due to the
lower growth rates planned for the major consuming sectors during 1976-80.
It is estimated that domestic consumption will reach 65 million pieces in
1980 and 85 million in 1985. In addition to meeting a major portion of
this domestic demand, the industry is also planning to continue exporting.
Exports are expected to reach 63 million pieces in 1985 (43% of total pro-
duction) compared to the 35 million (47%) estimated for 1976. The increased
domestic production would also help reduce the imports of special bearings
from about 6.4 million pieces in 1975 to 4.0 million in 1985.
iv.       A major part of exports would be under medium- to long-term sales
contracts with international bearings manufacturers and centrally planned
economies. However, to meet its ambitious export targets, the industry will
also have to substantially increase its own direct sales in market-oriented
economies. Due to the present lower product quality and lack of appropriate
marketing organization and customer service, Romanian bearings are currently



- ii -
being sold in these markets at prices often substantially below those obtained
by other established international bearings manufacturers. As product quality
improves and Romanian bearings become better known to major consumers, the
export prices realized are expected to increase. However, it is also apparent
that the above export targets can be achieved at profitable prices only if
the marketing arrangements abroad are strengthened. The Romanian authorities
have recently become aware of the need to improve the export marketing organi-
zation, and if this is indeed done as contemplated, the projected export sales
to market economies are expected to be realized.
v.         The Brasov Enterprise produces the largest mix of bearings amongst
Romanian producers. In 1976, it had planned to produce 28 million 1/ bearings,
of which 21.7 million (78%) were expected to be sold locally to supply 40% of
total domestic market needs. By 1984, Brasov plans to nearly double its
output to 53 million bearings, including some sizes and types currently not
produced locally. In that year, Brasov expects to place 75% of total sales
domestically and export the balance, including 7.7 million pieces (14% of
total sales) in Bank member countries. These sales targets are considered
realistic, provided the anticipated improvements in the export marketing
organization are carried out.
vi.       Like all other productive assets in the country, Brasov Enterprise
is owned by the State and has limited autonomy and decision-making responsi-
bilities outside production. It belongs to the Ministry of Machine Building
and is under the control of the Industrial Central for Bearings and Assembly
Components. Brasov's performance in recent years has been satisfactory and
its management group is considered capable of effectively running the Enter-
prise under the Romanian system.
vii.      The proposed project, designed to increase production capacity as
well as to manufacture a wider range of bearings of significantly improved
quality, consists of two distinct and technically separable components:
(a) erection of one new, fully automated high volume production line (the
Hi-Volume Component) with an annual capacity of 5.5 million bearings; and
(b) modernization and expansion of low volume facilities (the Low-Volume
Component) to reach a final capacity of 28.0 million pieces. An important
feature of the latter component is to increase the production of tapered
roller bearings from 2.6 million to 14.0 million pieces. Not part of the Bank
financed project is the contemplated expansion of the production of needle,
cardan and special bearings, which is being implemented and financed with
assistance from Koyo Seiko.
viii.     The Bank has worked closely with the Romanian authorities in the
formulation and improvement of the project scope and design. Since the
submission of the original project proposal in the fall of 1975, important
changes, aimed at improving the project's economic viability, have been made
in the product mix, timing, market orientation, and export marketing arrange-
ments. The Government has also agreed to create an industrial engineering
1/   Including needle and cardan bearings produced at facilities separate
from project components.

group at Brasov to review the possibilities of further improving the proj-
ect's product mix, labor productivity and working capital requirements, and
to identify on a continuous basis opportunities to further enhance the effi-
ciency of Brasov's operation.
ix.       Physical implementation of the project started in January 1977 and
will be completed in December 1981, though some Low-Volume component facil-
ities wouLd start production in the second half of 1979. The Brasov Enter-
prise will have the primary responsibility for project design, engineering
and implementation, and has on its staff personnel with prior experience in
executing similar projects. Buildings, civil works and erection will be
handled by the Enterprise for Erection of Special Industrial Buildings, as
it did for the new bearings plants at Alexandria and Birlad.
x.        Total financing required for the project, including interest during
construction, is estimated at Lei 1,861 million (US$93 million). The pro-
posed Bank loan of US$38 million would cover the estimated total foreign
exchange cost of the project. The remaining financing would be provided by
the Government of Romania in the form of equity. The Bank loan is proposed to
be extended to the Investment Bank. As in the case of other Bank projects
in Romania, the Investment Bank would pass on the loan proceeds to the Enter-
prise as state funds. However, annual depreciation and benefit remittances will
have to be sufficient to equal notional payments of a 10% interest rate
and principal on the Bank loan to the Investment Bank.
xi.       Due to the severe foreign exchange shortage in the country, the
Romanian authorities have set a value limit on direct imports from Bank mem-
ber countries to be permitted for the project of approximately US$26 million
as compared to the Bank's estimate of about US$31.5 million. To ensure that
the project remains technically acceptable and is executed along the lines
presented to the Bank, two complementary agreements obtained are critical:
(a) the equipment and division of sources of supply between local and im-
ported equipment as approved by the Government and agreed with the Bank
would remain essentially unchanged unless otherwise agreed to by the Bank;
and (b) the Government would permit imports above the value limit set by it
in case it becomes technically necessary in line with the assurance under
(a) above. However, should, contrary to current Bank expectations, the
cost of agreed imports be lower than the US$31.5 million being made avail-
able under the Bank loan, a part of the loan equivalent to the resultant re-
duction in the total foreign exchange cost of the project, will be cancelled.
xii.      The Bank loan would finance foreign currency cost of imported equip-
ment, spares and services estimated to cost US$31.5 million, on which only
foreign suppliers are expected to bid, and other equipment and machinery
totalling US$6.5 million, on which both foreign and Romanian suppliers are
likely to bid. Goods to be financed by the Bank will be procured under some
30 bid packages through international competitive bidding in conformity with
Bank guidelines.
xiii.     The financial situation of the Enterprise is projected to remain
satisfactory during and after project implementation, though under the



- iv -
Romanian financial system the financial position of an enterprise is
neither a true measure of its performance nor a factor in determining its
viability. The economic return of the project is calculated at 14.0%, com-
posed of an 18.9% return for the Hi-Volume Component and 11.2% for the Low-
Volume Component. The project would annually save about US$49 million in
foreign exchange, create some 500 new jobs, and also accrue substantial
additional revenues to the national budget through depreciation and bene-
fit remittances. It would significantly improve the quality of Romanian
bearings, which in turn would help improve the quality and competitiveness
of a wide range of industrial products manufactured for domestic and export
markets. Finally, the project would make Romania more self-sufficient in
bearings and introduce up-to-date technology in a critical industry.
xiv.      The risks associated with the project, which are considered moderate
and acceptable, are basically two-fold. First, as part of the national policy,
the project is expected to use some local equipment and components not cur-
rently produced domestically. While most critical equipment is ear-marked
for imports, there is always a modest risk that any equipment purchased
from a relatively new producer may present some initial teething problems.
Second, actual export volume (or prices) to market-oriented economies may be
lower than projected. However, since such sales are planned to be less than
15% of the total by volume (and even less by value) and because domestic
market forecasts are considered conservative, the market risk is moderate.
xv.       With the agreements and commitments obtained from the Government
and the Investment Bank, the project is considered suitable for a Bank loan
of US$38.0 million equivalent to the Investment Bank for a period of 13 years,
including 3 years of grace, at 8.2% interest.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the expansion and modernization project of
Brasov Bearings Enterprise (the Enterprise), the oldest and largest bearings
manufacturer in Romania and the seat of the Industrial Central for Bearings
and Assembly Components (CIROA). The plant is located at Brasov, the coun-
try's fifth largest city, about 200 kilometers north of Bucharest (Map).
The proposed project is designed to (a) increase capacity from 20.0 mil-
lion bearings in 1976 to 33.5 million bearings in 1982 1/; (b) introduce up-
to-date technology and modernize existing facilities; (c) expand the product
mix; and (d) substantially improve product quality.
1.02      The project is part of the Government's overall development strategy
to promote rapid expansion of domestic industry based on advanced technology
and to minimize reliance on imports of critical products needed by the indus-
trial sector. It would also allow the share of bearings exports to total
production to remain at about the present level and earn critically needed
foreign exchange. The total cost of the project is estimated at Lei 1,755
million (US$88 million), including Lei 760 million (US$38 million) in foreign
exchange costs. The proposed Bank loan would be US$38 million, equivalent
to the total foreign exchange cost of the project.
1.03      The project was identified in April 1975 by an industrial sector
mission, and preappraised in December 1975, when the need to make certain
modifications in the project scope, to improve its economic viability, became
apparent. The Government presented a modified project, which substantially
reduced the market risks, to the appraisal mission - comprising of Messrs.
Kohli (Chief), O'Neil and Sinha of the Industrial Projects Department and Mr.
Davey (consultant) - which visited Romania in April/May 1976. At the Bank's
suggestion, the Government agreed to review the possibilities of further
improving the project design to make the proposed investment economically more
attractive. These changes were reviewed by the Bank in the field in November
1976 and in Washington in March 1977.
1.04      A brief description of bearings industry technical terms, as well as
explanatory sketches of the principal types of bearings, are given in Annex 1.
II.  BEARINGS INDUSTRY AND ORGANIZATION
A.   Brief Historical Background
2.01      Romania enjoys some important advantages that have favored the devel-
opment of a domestic bearings industry. First, the country has a large number
of disciplined, well-trained and skilled workers available at a fraction of
1/   Aside from this project, another section of the plant, technically and
physically separate from the project, is also expected to increase the
capacity of needle, cardan and special bearings from 10.5 to 19.5 mil-
lion units, making the total plant capacity 53 million units in 1985.

the wages paid in developed countries, a crucial advantage in this formerly
labor-intensive industry. Second, even though bearings are a precision
product, the industry, until recently, used relatively simple and easily
available machine tools. Third, in recent years the Romanian domestic market
has been large enough to support volume production of selected bearings. And
finally, due to the very large variety of products involved in this industry,
inventory and/or production costs can be reduced to some extent if certainty
of demand and supply can be assured, which the Romanian system of centralized
planning can generally do.  Thus, the country is well-placed to develop
a competitive bearings industry, if the plants are properly designed and
operated (para. 9.05).
2.02      The Romanian bearings industry started in 1949 and has made rapid
progress.  In 1975, it supplied about 86% of domestic bearings needs (47
million pieces), while also exporting 22 million bearings (31% of produc-
tion) from four bearings plants; total domestic production totalled 71 mil-
lion bearings valued at approximately Lei 1,900 million (US$95 million).
This would make CIROA, the Central which controls all four bearings enter-
prises (Brasov, Birlad, Alexandria and Ploiesti; Map IBRD 12361), one of
the fifteen largest bearings producing companies in the world. The growth
in the domestic production is summarized below:

/a   Ploiesti annually produces large bearings totalling approx. 1,500 tons.
2.03      Initially, bearings were produced on a relatively small scale and
with know-how largely developed in Romania. However, in the late 1960s the
Government invited Koyo Seiko of Japan to help establish large modern pro-
duction facilities at Birlad and Alexandria, which were commissioned in 1974.
Similarly, in 1975 an agreement was signed with Rollway Bearings of the US
for the production of large-sized bearings at Ploiesti. Finally, in early
1977, Brasov reached an agreement with Koyo Seiko for the supply of the
advanced technology needed to produce needle and special bearings not yet
manufactured locally. This policy of combining locally developed skills with
foreign know-how and technology, wherever critically needed, is expected to
provide also in future the necessary technological base for this fast expand-
ing industry in Romania. A brief history of the Romanian bearing industry and
its organization is given in Annex 2-1.

B.   Industry Rationalization Program
2.04      Major changes took place in the bearings industry during the 1971-75
Plan period and are continuing. Not only were two major and modern new facili-
ties commissioned (Alexandria and Birlad), but the industry also launched a
major production rationalization program to improve efficiency by (a) producing
on new automated facilities large-volume bearings which were earlier produced
by less efficient low-volume production techniques; (b) eliminating manufacture
of most variations of the same basic bearings, and thus streamlining produc-
tion processes; and (c) increasing specialization of different plants by type
(groups) of bearings. A brief description of the production processes used
by the industry, and the changes being introduced, is given in Annex 2-2.
2.05      The basic concepts behind the rationalization program are in line
with the recent trends in the bearings industry elsewhere. Increased special-
ization in production is generally considered as the key to achieving lower
production costs and higher plant and labor productivity in bearings plants.
With the proposed expansion and modernization of the Brasov plant and the
opening of the new Ploiesti plant, most of the objectives of the rationaliza-
tion program would have been achieved by 1982. But the full potential benefits
of this program in terms of lower costs can be attained only after a review of
Brasov's proposed product mix (para. 5.08).
C.  Organization of Bearings Industry
2.06      Like most other productive assets in the Romanian economy, the bear-
ings industry is owned and managed by the State, which sets specific production
and other targets and makes available the necessary resources to meet such tar-
gets. 1/ The organization structure of the industry, depicted in Annex 2-3,
has a three step hierarchy consisting of the Technical Ministries (nine in
all) at the top, Industrial Centrals in the middle and the Enterprises at the
bottom. The bearings industry belongs to the Ministry of Machine Building
Industries, which - through 10 Centrals - controls about 150 enterprises that
produce automobiles, trucks, earthmoving machinery, machine-tools, power
generating equipment, and other heavy machinery in addition to engineering
goods like bearings. The Ministry is responsible for the overall performance
of the sub-sector, coordinates its activities with other parts of the economy,
translates overall national economic objectives into specific financial and
physical targets for individual industries, and approves specific investments.
2.07      Under the Vice Minister responsible for the planning and execution of
new projects in the Ministry, are the Central Design Institute and the Construc-
tion Trusts 2/ responsible respectively for engineering and construction. However,
unlike most other cases, the Ministry of Machine Building does not have under

in Romania", dated October 11, 1974.

of Industrial Constructors.

its control the export and import of bearings; this function is exclusively
handled by the TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT Enterprise, which belongs to the Ministry of
Foreign Trade. This organizational separation of the foreign trade responsi-
bilities from other aspects of the bearings industry is under review by the
Romanian authorities (para. 4.23).
2.08      CIROA, the Central, is responsible for the production and domestic
distribution of bearings and industrial fasteners. Under its jurisdiction,
there are the four plants engaged in the production of bearings (para 2.02);
five plants producing industrial fasteners; an enterprise responsible for
domestic sales and distribution; and the Design and Research Center for Bear-
ings and Fasteners. CIROA's basic role is in the planning area. It acts as
a conduit between the Ministry and the enterprises and is responsible for co-
ordination, preparation and monitoring of annual and five-year financial and
production plans in the sub-sector. The General Managers of all enterprises
report to CIROA's General Director, who chairs the executive committee of the
Central composed of worker representatives and managers of the enterprises.
III. THE ENTERPRISE
A.   Plant Facilities
3.01      Since its inception in 1949, Brasov has remained the largest bearings
producer in Romania. After the plant was designated as Brasov Bearings Enter-
prise in 1959, its production increased rapidly from 3.2 million pieces in 1960
to 28.5 million in 1975. The plant produces the largest mix of bearings amongst
Romanian plants, including: (a) single row radial ball bearings; (b) double row
radial axial and self-aligning ball bearings; (c) tapered roller bearings; (d)
needle and cardan bearings; (e) plain bearings; and (f) other special bearings.
Brasov sells part of its ball production and some forgings to the Birlad plant
and is also responsible for producing certain specialized equipment needed by
the Romanian bearings industry.
B.   Organization and Management
3.02      The Enterprise, like other industrial enterprises in Romania, is
primarily a production-oriented organization with only limited autonomy and
decision-making responsibilities outside production. While it has its own pro-
duction plans (based on targets set by the Plan), prepares separate financial
statements, and can borrow money from designated banks, any substantive
changes in its organizational structure, investment programs, production
targets, or in product mix must be approved by the Council of Ministers.
3.03      The Enterprise's organization structure is shown in Annex 3-1; it is
adequate under Romanian conditions for fulfilling production functions.  Tech-
nically, the ultimate decision-making power lies with the Workers' General As-
sembly, which normally meets twice a year to examine the operating results and
review the performance of the Working People's Executive Committee. This



- 5 -
Executive Committee, consisting of elected representatives of workers and also
some key members of the management, is chaired by the General Director of the
Enterprise who is normally appointed by the Minister of Machine Building. The
General Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations and implementation
of the decisions taken by the Executive Committee, through a team of key
managers, such as for production and other technical matters, sales and
procurement, as well as finance and accounting.
3.04      The Enterprise is well managed.  The General Director has delegated
most of the day-to-day operational responsibilities to the Technical Director,
a dynamic and capable manager, who has been associated with the industry in
various senior positions for more than 25 years. He is well versed in the
technical developments in the industry outside Romania and is supported by a
group of experienced and dedicated engineers. The management group is con-
sidered capable of effectively running the Enterprise under the Romanian system.
C.   Romanian Financial System
3.05      The conventional financial analysis applied by the Bank to evaluate
the performance of commercial organizations is of limited significance in the
case of Romanian enterprises, which draw up their annual financial plans to
meet the specified targets allocated to them; together these make up the so-
called National Financial Plan. The National Financial Plan and the State
Budget are submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval and then to the
Grand National Assembly; after its approval they become law. The State also
determines all prices. Therefore, as noted above, since the primary responsi-
bility of Romanian enterprises is to meet the physical production targets set
for them by higher authorities and make optimum use of resources provided to
them and since the product mix and prices of all inputs and outputs are pre-
determined, the financial profitability neither fully reflects an enterprise's
efficiency nor is an important factor in investment decisions (see also Bank
report No. 459-RO" Appraisal of Tecuci Fertilizer Project", dated May 21,
1974). The following financial analysis of the Enterprise should be viewed in
this context.

D.   Financial Performance - Brasov Enterprise
3.06      The Enterprise's performance in the recent past has been satisfac-
tory. Detailed financial statements are presented in Annexes 3-2, 3-3 and
3-4 and summarized below.

/a   In mid-1974 the production price of bearings was temporarily reduced.  It
was again raised in Jan. 1976, about 15% above the pre-1974 level.
3.07      During the 1971-75 Plan period, the Enterprise's sales value in-
creased by 32% and sales volume by 35%, while net profits (benefits) as a
percentage of sales declined from 16.1% to 10.9%. However, this decline in
financial profitability is due mainly to the Government's decision in mid-1974
to temporarily reduce the price of bearings by an average of 14.4% (para.
4.16). In case mid-1974 prices were still in effect, 1975 revenues would have
been Lei 940 million (instead of Lei 853 million) and benefits 19.1% of sales
(instead of 10.9%).
3.08      Brasov has a satisfactory financial structure considering the
special characteristics of Romanian investment practices and the cash flow
system. Like most Romanian enterprises, Brasov has incurred practically no
long-term debt in recent years except for some medium-term credits extended
by the Investment Bank for the financing of equipment for projects under
construction. These credits are paid off, through the infusion of equivalent
equity funds (State advances), as the plant is commissioned.  As a result, at
the end of 1975, Brasov had no long-term debt outstanding and "equity"
accounted for about 78% of total assets.
E.   Investment Bank - The Borrower
3.09      The Investment Bank (IB) administers and controls all investment
funds of the State Budget (except for agriculture and food processing) and
acts as the channel for all sources of major domestic investment financing in
industry. Recently, IB has also started to make credits on its own, though



- 7 -
funds available for this purpose are still relatively small. The President of
IB reports directly to the Minister of Finance who has comprehensive authority
in the planning and financing of all projects.
3.10      The IB has wide-ranging responsibilities in the implementation of
projects and plays an important role in project evaluation, procurement and
execution. For all projects, IB reviews the techno-economic study before
submission to the Council of Ministers for formal approval, and later ensures
that the projects are executed accordingly. In the case of the proposed
project, IB will review, with the assistance of Brasov and UZINEXPORTIMPORT,
all orders for equipment before they are placed, will comment on any contract
changes, and can impose penalties on defaulting parties. During the oper-
ational phase of the project, IB's functions are limited to checking whether
the enterprise is meeting the targets set in the Investment Plan. IB has no
legal authority to bring its views to bear directly on the management of an
enterprise. In practice, however, IB ccn recommend necessary operational
actions to the Ministry of Finance, which, in turn, can act through the
ministry concerned with the project. As in case of previous Bank loans to it,
the Investment Bank has agreed to submit its properly audited financial reports
to the Bank in an agreed form and withirn agreed dates.
IV. MARKET AND MARKETING
4.01      In 1975, about 79% of Brasov's production was marketed in Romania
and the balance exported to some 50 centrally planned economies and Bank
member countries. After project completion, in 1985 about 75% of its produc-
tion will be sold domestically and the balance 25% exported, including about
10% to COMECON countries as part of long term bilateral trade agreements. The
recent developments and future prospects of the Romanian bearings industry's
main markets are discussed in Annex 4-1 (domestic market) and Annex 4-2
(export markets). This chapter first discusses the overall domestic and
export markets for Romanian bearings and then reviews Brasov's role and
plans in these markets.
A.   Domestic Romanian Market - Recent Consumption and Production
4.02      Consumption of bearings in Romiania over the last 25 years increased
from 0.44 million pieces in 1950 to 46.6 million pieces in 1975, representing
an average annual growth rate of 20%. While consumption growth has slowed
down somewhat since the early 1960's, it has still been averaging about 12-15%
annually with only relatively minor fluctuations over the past fifteen years.
Historically, over a third of bearings consumed locally had to be imported.
However, with the commissioning of the major new production facilities at
Birlad and Alexandria (paras. 2.02-2.03) in 1973 and 1974, domestic produc-
tion has increased faster than consumption; this has not only made Romania
more self-sufficient in bearings but also allowed it to more than triple
exports, as shown in the table below:

4.03      The Romanian economy overall and, in particular, the industrial
sector which is the main consumer of bearings, have recently shown a very
high growth rate. The past development of demand for bearings by major
consumers is detailed in Annex 4-1 and the following table compares the
sectoral growth rate during 1950-75 with bearings consumption.

Bearings Consumption      37.0%   23.0%    15.6%       13.2%    12.7%    20.5%
4.04      The primary industrial bearings consumers in Romania, as in other
countries, have been in the transportation sector, machine-tool and techno-
logical equipment building sector and the electrical equipment manufacturing
sector, all of which have historically experienced rapid growth thereby gen-
erating an equally rapid growth in demand for bearings.
B.   Domestic Romanian Market - Projected Demand and Supply
4.05      A high growth in demand for bearings in Romania is likely to con-
tinue in the foreseeable future, although below the rate achieved in 1970-75.
This is due, during the 1976-80 period, to the lower planned growth rates
of the Romanian economy in general and of the major bearings consuming sectors
more specifically. CIROA's projections of the bearings market for 1976-85 are
discussed in detail in Annex 4-1 and summarized below:

Total Demand              46.6  52.0  55.0  59.0  62.0  65.0  85.0    6.9%   5.5%
4.06      The forecast indicates an average annual growth rate of 6.9% between
1975-80 and 5.5% during 1980-85, compared to 12.7% experienced during the last
Plan period (1970-75). In Romania, consumption is more a function of State
planning and allocation than of market and price consideration.  Therefore,
demand projections should be evaluated less on an extrapolation of historical
consumption figures but primarily on an end-use analysis, taking into consid-
eration plans approved for individual sectors and actual users of bearings.
Such an analysis, detailed in Annex 4-1, indicates that the market growth
projected in the above table may be overly conservative, if the national
economy indeed grows at the rate specified in the 1976-80 Plan and visual-
ized for 1981-1990.
4.07      Industry plans call for an increasing share of the total market to
be supplied from domestic production with a parallel increase in exports as
indicated by the table below. However if the actual domestic demand indeed
turns out to be higher than projected by CIROA, as seems possible, then the
surplus left for exports would be reduced.

4.08      Imports of bearings will continue to be restricted to those types
which cannot be produced domestically. These primarily consist of high-
precision bearings needed for use in sophisticated machinery, aircraft and
other advanced equipment, which are produced mainly in developed countries.
Some imports also relate to bearings needed, in very small quantities, to
maintain old imported equipment.

C.   Export Markets for Romanian Bearings
4.09      Export markets have absorbed between one-third and one-fourth of
total Romanian bearings production since 1965 and from 1974 Romania has been
a net exporter of bearings. As shown in the following table, initially bear-
ings were exported primarily to COMECON member countries and to countries
with which Romania maintained bilateral trade relations.

/a   Including sales to international bearing companies.
However, since the late sixties, concerted efforts have been made to increase
the share of bearings exported to convertible currency areas. In addition to
employing usual marketing techniques, CIROA and TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT reached
agreements with leading bearings producers in Western Europe and Japan for
sales of bearings under multi-year contracts. Most of the bearings exported
are technically relatively simple to produce and are used in large volume. In
market economies, their sales are sensitive to price, quality and customer
service. The export projections in the table reflect five-year trade agree-
ments signed with COMECON members, bilateral trade agreements with a number of
other countries, commercial deals agreed with some of the leading bearings
companies in OECD and the perceived potential of direct export of bearings.
4.10      The world bearings industry is currently in an unusual situation.
In the early seventies, the industry enjoyed strong sales as most developed
economics, which are the main consumers of bearings, maintained relatively
high growth.   In some countries, particularly in North America, there were
periods when demand marginally exceeded supply resulting in long delivery
times. During the same period, major new developments were taking place on
the supply side.  Most large producers, led by Japanese and US companies,
introduced large-scale automation in the production of many ball bearings
(and subsequently of some tapered roller bearings) sold in large volume.
This not only reduced relative production costs in this formerly labor-
intensive industry, but also created substantial new capacity specially
in Japan and Western Europe.



- 11 -
4.11      At the same time, major expansion programs were launched in a number
of East European countries, aimed to increase manifold their exports to conver-
tible currency areas. Much of the new capacity came on stream just as the
worldwide economic slowdown was depressing sales in late 1974 and in 1975,
adversely affecting sales and capacity utilization and limiting the producers'
ability to adjust their prices to reflect sharply increased input costs 1/.
Most countries consider their bearings industry of strategic importance. As
domestic producers in the US and Europe faced increased competition from
imports during a period of declining sales and profits, many governments ini-
tiated actions to restrict imports in 1975 and 1976.
4.12      While the above situation is considered temporary and sales started
to recover in 1976, the recent developments will make the planned substantial
increases in Romanian exports to OECD countries more difficult, particularly
if most expansion programs currently under consideration in other centrally
planned economies are indeed proceeding as planned.  Romania's total 1975
direct exports to both COMECON members and developed economies were substan-
tially below original targets though sales did improve in 1976.  The Romanian
authorities seem aware of this problem and have initiated a thorough review of
the export targets and of export marketing arrangements.  As a result, Brasov's
expansion program was extended in time and its export targets for convertible
currency areas were reduced somewhat.
D.   Brasov Enterprise's Market
4.13      Brasov's recent and projected total sales are shown in Annexes 4-3

one-third of their capacity idle.

Domestic sales as a percentage of total sales are expected to decline mar-
ginally between 1976 and 1985, and the export market share is expected to
increase slightly, partly due to the increases directed towards convertible
currency countries.
4.14      Domestic Markets:  The following table summarizes past and future
domestic sales by major consuming sector, as summarized from Annexes 4-5 and
4-6:

Historically, transportation vehicle and agricultural tractor producing enter-
prises have accounted for about 30% of Brasov's total domestic sales and this
is expected to remain unchanged during the forecast period; a stable share is
also forecast for the replacement market. On the other hand, due to the pro-
jected changes in the Enterprise's product mix and the higher production
growth rates planned for the machine tool and electrical and other equipment
manufacturing plants, Brasov's sales share to these sub-sectors would increase
by over 30%, compensated by a decline in the proportion of sales to other
original equipment manufacturers (OEM). These changes are generally in line
with the trend for the total Romanian bearings industry.
4.15      Exports:  Brasov's historic and projected export sales are evaluated
in Annex 4-2 and summarized below:

Between 1976 and 1985, Brasov's total exports are expected to almost double,
after a major rebound expected in 1977 as exports to convertible currency
countries recover to 3.8 million pieces compared to 1.5 million in 1976, when



- 13 -
Romanian exports were severely hurt by the lack of demand in Western Europe
(1974 exports were 4.1 million). Brasov's medium-term export plans are
considered reasonable and should be achieved if the planned improvements in
the export marketing organization are carried out (para. 4.23) and if the
proposed product buy-back sales agreements with foreign manufacturers are
indeed implemented (para. 5.05).
E.   Prices
4.16      Until the general resetting of prices in Romania, which became
effective in 1976, there were three different levels of domestic prices for
bearings: (a) the "calculation price" (also known as producer price) received
by the producing enterprise; (b) the "delivery price," higher than the calcu-
lation price, paid by the original equipment manufacturers to the distribution
enterprise; and (c) the "retail price," higher than delivery price, paid by
small consumers to retailers. These prices had remained generally unchanged
since 1963, when most bearings were imported and delivery prices were set in
line with international prices. However, since calculation prices were set to
provide the producing enterprise a 10% margin on costs and because, with time,
most domestic inputs like steel and labor became priced much below world
prices and the production costs also declined due to increased economies of
scale, calculation prices dropped substantially below delivery prices. With
the recent resetting of prices, which almost doubled the bearing steel price,
the cost of bearings production and therefore calculation prices were raised
about 40% and 30% respectively as of January 1, 1976. However, the delivery
prices have been simultaneously lowered by about 18%, by equating the delivery
and calculation prices. These changes are described in detail in Annex 4-9.
4.17      Revised domestic delivery prices are approximately two-thirds of
the estimated prices charged by leading international producers from their OEM
customers. However, considering that the Romanian prices do not include any
marketing and transportation charges, and taking into account quality differ-
ences, domestic prices are considered to be in line with international prices.
4.18      Furthermore, Romanian export agencies maintain two separate lists
of export prices - one for COMECON countries and the other for market economy
countries. The prices applicable for COMECON trade are fixed by the Central
Organization of Bearing Producers and Consumers (OCIR) in COMECON, on the
basis of the weighted average of prices offered by all producing countries in
COMECON. These negotiated prices in Roubles are currently, on the average,
approximately 9% higher than domestic Rcmanian prices, if converted at the
effective 1 Rouble = 20 Lei rate. 1/ Until 1975, OCIR prices were fixed for
five years but from 1976 onwards they are subject to annual review.
4.19      The pricing structure followed in the world bearings industry does
not allow an accurate comparison between prices charged by different suppliers.
The price of the same product varies between the types of suppliers (large
established suppliers enjoy a premium over smaller, newer companies) and also
1/   In Romania, for purposes of foreign trade, currently one Rouble is
treated as equal to one Dollar in value even though at the official
rates of exchange a Rouble is equal to US$1.3.



- 14 -
depends on the customers (large original equipment manufacturers pay much
lower prices than retail customers). Furthermore, there are thousands of
products and the published catalog prices are often many times more than the
actual prices paid by most customers. While it is extremely difficult to
determine the actual sales prices, it is estimated that in mid-1976 major
bearings producers in North America and W. Europe were selling bearings at
discounts varying between 55-70% below catalog prices, with another 30% re-
bate on the discounted price offered to OEM consumers. The prices listed
in TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT's catalog for customers in market economies are, in
general, slightly higher than domestic Romanian prices and follow the pat-
tern of published catalog prices of leading bearings companies. TECHNOEXPORT
also follows the international industry policy and offers discounts on its
catalog prices but, due to generally lower quality of its products, lack of
adequate technical service and marketing effort, and due to non-familiarity
of customers with Romanian bearings, its average export price of bearings
is estimated to have been often substantially below prices charged by major
producers in Western Europe; however, a comparison of Brasov's expected costs
and revenues confirms that even from these exports Brasov will recover, on the
whole, full cost of production. But it is also believed that, like some other
recent new entrants in the market, TECHNOEXPORT would be able to obtain better
prices once its products are established in the market, the product quality is
improved to international levels (para. 5.06) and the export marketing organi-
zation is strengthened (para. 4.23).
F.   Distribution System
4.20      CIROA also has a warehousing enterprise known as BAZA, headquar-
tered in Brasov. BAZA maintains warehouses at each plant and in each region
and is obligated to keep an average of about three-months supply of bearings
at these locations. It deals directly with the large consumers in Romania,
but the small consumers are served through numerous state-owned retail
outlets, supplied from BAZA's decentralized warehouses located in individual
judets.
4.21      The quantity, type and quality of bearings to be distributed to
various consumers is determined by BAZA on the basis of requests received
from the original equipment manufacturers and within the general context
of the five-year plan and the availability of bearings. This general five-
year allocation becomes the basis of a detailed annual distribution plan.
BAZA also offers technical assistance to the consumers for selecting the
right type of bearing for their application. It relies on the Design Center
for expert advice whenever a customer requires bearings for a new application.
The domestic distribution system is satisfactory.
G.   Export Marketing Organization
4.22      As already mentioned in para. 2.07, the responsibility for export-
ing bearings is assigned to TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT, an arrangement consistent with
the Romanian foreign trade system. Until recently, TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT main-
tained no overseas sales offices devoted mainly to bearing sales or warehouses
to provide quick service to customers. While this system is possibly adequate



- 15 -
for exporting commodities or established products (Romania's traditional
exports) and for bilateral trading areas, for exporting precision and price
sensitive items like bearings to developed countries, which normally require
extensive customer service, this insulation of marketing and production
functions is deficient. Even after the expected improvements in product
quality, Romania may find it difficult to profitably meet its export targets
to convertible currency countries, unless some organization changes are forth-
coming. This judgment is supported by the relatively low prices Romania is
obtaining (para 4.19) and its poor export performance in 1975-76 (para 4.15)
in these countries.
4.23      Romanian authorities are aware of this problem and are currently
implementing a major reorganization of export marketing under which: (a)
TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT and CIROA would work together more closely to develop
export markets; (b) overseas regional sales offices, devoted exclusively
to bearings exports and supported by warehouses, would be opened; (c) CIROA
has created a new export department in Brasov; and (d) TECHNOEXPORTIMPORT
would create a separate bearings export department and expand its sales force.
These changes are in the right direction and it is expected that Brasov's
export targets can be achieved and higher export prices realized if they
are effectively implemented. Satisfactory agreements have been reached with
the Government that these improvements in the marketing arrangements would be
implemented.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Scope and Objectives
5.01      The proposed modernization and expansion project is an important
part of the overall industry rationalization program described earlier in
para 2.04. The project is designed to achieve four basic objectives: (a)
to expand annual production capacity from its present level of 20.0 million
pieces of bearings to 33.5 million by 1982; (b) to bring the average quality
of bearings nearer to international standards; (c) to produce a wider range
of bearings in order to minimize Romania's reliance on imported bearings;
and (d) to improve the overall productivity of the Enterprise through the
introduction of modern production processes and equipment. The project was
designed, engineered and revised by the Brasov Enterprise, in close collabora-
tion with the Design Center, between early 1975 and February 1977. In addition
to these project facilities, Brasov is currently also expanding some other
plant facilities as explained in para 5.05.
B.   Project Components
5.02      The project consists of two distinct and technically separable com-
ponents: (a) erection of one new modern, fully automated high volume produc-
tion line (the Hi-Volume Component) with a capacity of 5.5 million bearings;
and (b) modernization and expansion of low volume facilities (the Low-Volume
Component) to reach a final capacity of 28.0 million pieces of a relatively
higher value product mix. The latter would include facilities for substantially



- 16 -
increasing the production of tapered roller bearings from 2.6 million to 14
million pieces. 1/ In addition, necessary auxiliary facilities like utilities
and general maintenance shops as well as physical infrastructure would be
expanded to support increased production. The Hi- and Low-Volume components
would share a common forge shop, a ball shop and a small retainers shop. A
detailed description of the project is given in Annex 5-2.
5.03      The Hi-Volume component of the project has been specifically de-
signed to produce bearings needed in large numbers and on large production
runs permitting the use of specialized equipment and a high degree of automa-
tion. It will include one automated line, with a capacity of about 10,000
bearings per shift, which starts with forged rings for inner and outer races at
one end and finishes with fully inspected and assembled bearings at the other
end. The basic process is shown in detail in the flow chart (Annex 5-3) and
the plant layout (Annex 5-4). The component is technically well conceived
and is comparable to new plants being developed elsewhere.
5.04      The basic production steps to be used in the Low-Volume component
are the same as above (see Annexes 5-5 and 5-6 for the layout and flow chart).
But, since the Low-Volume component would produce a much greater variety of
bearings in a wider range of sizes, it would be equipped with more flexible,
general machining and grinding equipment. The assembly and inspection opera-
tions as also most of the material handling and machine loading would be
manual, as dictated by the relatively shorter production runs. A significant
portion of the Enterprise's current production facilities, which would form
the nucleus of the Low-Volume component, are old and in need of urgent modern-
ization. Under the project, obsolete equipment would be scrapped and up-to-
date machinery installed, particularly for ball and roller making, machining,
grinding and quality control to reach the desired quality mix. At the same
time forging, ball and roller making capacity would be increased to utilize
the additional machining, grinding and heat-treatment capacity created
partly from this modernization but primarily from the shift of some 5.0
million bearings currently produced by low-volume production processes to
the new high-volume production line.
5.05      In addition to the above mentioned components proposed for Bank
financing, the Enterprise is also considering expanding the production of
needle, cardan and special bearings from 10.5 million pieces to 19.5 million.
This facility, technically and physically separate from the project, will
be implemented and financed with assistince from Koyo Seiko, one of the lead-
ing international manufacturers in this field. Negotiations for such coopera-
tion, and a complementary product buy-back agreement, were concluded in early
1/   These capacity estimates are based on the proposed product mix, current
operating practices and three shift operations. As in most other mechani-
cal industries, it is extremely difficult to calculate the exact capacity
of a bearings plant.



- 17 -
1977. Since, at the time of appraisal in mid-1976, it was uncertain when
and if such an agreement would be finalized and implemented and because Bank
assistance for it was not considered necessary, this facility has not been
reviewed in detail. Implementation of this facility is not likely to have any
adverse impact on Brasov's ability to carry out the project being financed by
the Bank.
C.   Quality Improvement
5.06      Currently, the average quality of bearings produced at Brasov is
below world standards, primarily due to the use of old and obsolete equipment
This leads to less accurate tolerances and, in turn, to a reduction in the
average expected useful life of bearings and a higher noise level; these are
the two most critical areas that determine bearing quality. In 1975, 45% of
bearings produced at Brasov were rated as PO, which is the lowest quality
standard and, though used in non-critical applications, is not normally
produced in significant quantity by most reputed manufacturers in developed
countries. A detailed description of quality designations and Brasov's
quality-mix is given in Annex 5-1.
5.07      The project is designed to substantially improve the quality of
bearings production through (a) introduction in the Hi-Volume component of a
fully automated production line with in-process gauging; (b) replacement of
older machines and tools with more accurate equipment in the low-volume
production facilities; (c) erection of a new ball-shop; and (d) improvement
in inspection and quality control techniques. As a result, after project
completion Brasov's quality-mix would approach international norms as sum-
marized below:
Brasov Enterprise: Improvement in Quality Mix 1975-85
Quality Designations         % in 1975       % in 1985
P0                      45               10
P6                      40               60

P4                        5              10
100             100
D.   Product Mix
5.08      The choice of production process and the cost effectiveness of a
bearings plant are greatly dependent on the product mix. A bearings plant
designed to produce only a limited range of similar bearings in large volume
can be designed for low skilled labor needs and for high equipment utiliza-
tion and product quality. On the other hand, bearings plants producing a
large variety of bearings in relatively short average runs, must use flexible
and therefore general purpose machine tools and tend to have relatively
higher production costs due to much higher skilled labor needs and lower
equipment utilization. Most new bearings plants currently under implementa-
tion in developed countries are based on the high-volume production techniques



- 18 -
to counter rising labor and equipment costs; as a corollary, the industry
worldwide is making every effort to narrow the variety of bearings (and thus
increase production runs) in individual plants.
5.09      In 1975, Romania consumed about 47 million bearings of some 6,000
different series numbers. 1/ Of these, about 41 million bearings consisting
of some 600 series numbers were supplied from domestic production and the
balance 6 million pieces of about 5,400 series numbers were imported. Under
the Government's instructions, CIROA is to widen the product mix of domestic
production to about 900 series numbers in 1980, in order to reduce expected
imports by about half.  The proposed expansion project at Brasov has been
designed to achieve a part of this objective.
5.10      Brasov currently produces about 30 million bearings of 210 basic
sizes (in 312 different series numbers) and proposes to produce 340 basic
bearing sizes (in 428 different series number) after the expansion project.
A detailed analysis of the product mix (Annex 5-7) indicates that the product
mix proposed for the Hi-Volume component is fully comparable to that of most
modern bearings plants currently under development elsewhere. On the other
hand, the product mix proposed for the Low-Volume component is not in line
with this industry trend and could be improved by reducing the number of
bearings produced in very small runs. While minimum economic production
volume depends greatly on the size, complexity and the sales value of a
bearing, it is believed that before add-ng any bearing with an annual volume
below 50,000, the economics of such production must be established. The
elimination of a number of bearings falling in this category could substan-
tially improve equipment utilization and thus improve the economics of this
project component; any likely changes in product mix are not expected to have
a significant effect on the type or design of equipment. The Government has
agreed to have the Enterprise undertake by March 31, 1978 such a review, which
would be carried out by the proposed industrial engineering group as one of
its first assignments (para 5.14).
E.   Labor Needs and Training
5.11      As discussed in detail in Annex 5-8, Brasov has currently 6,280
employees 2/ and had plans to raise the number by 1,244 persons to 7,524 2/
upon project completion. These numbers indicate substantially higher labor
requirements than in similar bearings' plants in developed countries with
comparable product mix. The Bank's review indicated that Brasov's labor needs
could be cut 10 to 15% below this level, without affecting the output or the
investment cost substantially. This would mean that instead of increasing
1/   The same size and type of bearing can have many different types of seals,
cases, etc., and thus lead to a number of different series numbers. The
exact number of different sizes of bearings used in Romania is not known
but is reportedly substantially less than the 6,000 series numbers used.
2/   Excluding labor needs of the needle, cardan and special bearings facil-
ities and of the proposed new machine tools plant.



- 19 -
the labor force by about 1,250 new workers, as originally proposed, the proj-
ect should need no more than about 400-500 new workers.
5.12      The Bank has made specific recommendations for changes in layout
and labor practices in some key plant areas, to assist Brasov in conducting
a review of its additional labor needs which the Government has ordered in
response to the Bank's findings. This review has been initiated and has
already identified areas to reduce labor needs by about 200 workers. It
will be completed before March 31, 1978, by the proposed industrial enginering
group, after the selection of critical equipment is finalized towards the end
of 1977. Brasov will continue to discuss progress of this review with the
Bank.
5.13      The training of workers is well organized at Brasov, which runs a
large training school next to the plant. Other institutes such as vocational
and engineering schools run by the Government provide well trained supervisors
and skilled technicians. The Enterprise is aware that adequate worker training
is critical to achieving the project's demanding objectives. It has drawn up
a detailed program to ensure that all necessary skills are available on time.
The training schemes to be employed under this program and details of differ-
ent types of workers and supervisory staff to be trained during 1976-80 are
given in Annex 5-9. The training arrangements proposed are adequate.
F.   Industrial Engineering
5.14      The industrial engineering techniques widely employed in other Bank
member countries are not being used adequately at Brasov. An increased use of
systematic analysis of product mix, basic work methods, plant layout, material
handling and production standards is expected to lead to improved labor pro-
ductivity and equipment utilization and thus reduce production costs. Brasov
has agreed to form a small Industrial Engineering Methods and Standards Group
within its organization. As its first tasks this group would recommend possi-
ble improvements in Brasov's product mix, labor productivity and inventory
levels to further enhance the plant's economic viability (para. 5.12).
G.   Raw Materials and Utilities
5.15      No difficulties are foreseen in obtaining raw materials, the most
important of which are special (chrome) steels in bar form. At present Romania
is not self-sufficient in the special steels required for bearings production
and, in 1975, Brasov imported about half of its 45,000 ton needs, which are
about to double (85,000 tons/year) after project completion. However, before
end-1980 the new Tirgoviste Steel Complex, partly financed by a Bank loan,
will come into production and supply most of Brasov's special steel needs.
The project would also annually need about 3,000 tons of bimetallic bands for
the production of plain bearings, and small amounts of brass rings and tool
steels which are also adequately available domestically. The Government has
confirmed to the Bank that the recent earthquake will have no adverse effect
on Brasov's raw material supplies or on any other requirements.
5.16      Regarding utilities, Brasov will require approximately 192 MWH/year
after project completion, compared to about 90 MWH at present. Satisfactory



- 20 -
arrangements have been made with the national power system to supply these
requirements. Similarly, no difficulties are foreseen in obtaining the
plant's modest requirements of water, gas, steam, compressed air and other
utilities (Annex 5-2).
H.   Ecology
5.17      The project has been designed after a careful consideration of en-
vironmental and worker safety aspects. A Romanian law for environmental and
pollution control, passed in 1973, stipulates that all industrial enterprises
must conform to environmental and workers safety standards specified in the
legislation relevant to the industry concerned. The Brasov enterprise is
within these standards except for inplant air quality and noise levels in
the forge shop, ball shop and primary machining shop. Under the project,
necessary provisions have been made to develop new facilities in conformity
with the specified standards and to upgrade the working conditions in existing
facilities at least up to the minimum legal requirements, as discussed in
Annex 5-10. In addition, in some key assembly, lubrication and final inspec-
tion areas, air-conditioning and air-filtering systems would be expanded both
to improve the working conditions and to ensure better product quality. No
significant adverse external environmental impact is expected from the project.
The Bank has obtained satisfactory assurances that, after project completion,
the plant will conform to satisfactory environmental standards, adequately
monitored.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
A.   Implementation Schedule
6.01      The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 6-1.  Engineer-
ing and design of the project as originally proposed are well advanced, though
further work in this area is now necessary, both because in May 1976 the proj-
ect completion date was postponed from mid-1980 to end-1981 and because of
the Government's ongoing review of the project's product-mix and the labor
force build-up. Physical implementation started in early 1977. Some of the
Low-Volume facilities are forecast to become operational in late 1979 (though
all the facilities will have been installed only by 1981) and the Hi-Volume
component is expected to be completed by December 1980 (Annex 6-2); full
capacity production of the target would only be attained in 1985. Equipment
delivery and construction schedules, which are considered reasonable, are
based on information provided by potential suppliers as well as by CIROA
and the Enterprise.
B.   Project Management
6.02      The Brasov Enterprise will have primary responsibility for proj-
ect implementation. Since the Enterprise and CIROA have common senior
staff, the project, in effect, would draw on the experience gained by
CIROA in the recent execution of the Alexandria and Birlad projects (para.
2.03). Thus, the Enterprise can be reasonably expected to have sufficient



- 21 -
well experienced personnel to satisfactorily manage project implementation.
Direct responsibility for project execution is delegated to CIROA's Engineer-
ing Department, which is headed by a competent and experienced engineer who
will report to Brasov's Technical Director. For coordinating and supervis-
ing the procurement activities, Brasov has designated another experienced
engineer who was the chief engineer of the Alexandria plant during its recent
construction. Brasov's project implementation unit, adequately supported by
CIROA, is considered competent to carry out the project.
6.03      The organizational setup for project implementation is shown in
Annex 6-3. The project will be designed and engineered by Brasov's (and
CIROA's) Engineering Department in close collaboration with the Design
Center (para 2.08) and the Central Design Institute for Machine Tools. The
plant facilities will be constructed by the Enterprise for Erection of Spe-
cial Industrial Buildings, a Construction Trust working for the Ministry
of Machine Building; the trust was responsible for erecting other bearings
plants and thus is well suited for this assignment. The project implementa-
tion unit would be directly responsible for selecting and contracting locally
produced equipment and supplies. But, as required by Romanian law, six
foreign trade enterprises will be involved in procuring imported equipment
and will have to become familiar with the Bank's procurement procedures. To
minimize potential problems, Brasov has appointed a procurement coordinator.
The Bank has also obtained assurances that UZINEXPORTIMPORT will coordinate
the activities of the six foreign trade enterprises and will also create
a small group within it to handle procurement for the project.
VII. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Project Costs
7.01      Total capital cost of the project is estimated at Lei 1,755.2
million (US$87.8 million) and total financing required, including interest
during construction, at Lei 1,861.0 million (US$93.1 million) as detailed
in Annex 7-1 and summarized below:

/b   Calculated at 8.2% interest rate.
7.02      Annex 7-2 gives a detailed allocation of the project costs between
the Hi- and Low-Volume components, which account for about 14% and 86%, re-
spectively, of base costs. The project cost estimates were prepared by the
Enterprise in collaboration with the Design Center in early 1977 and were
revised by Bank staff in March 1977 to include a more adequate provision for
price escalation. The revised estimates make an escalation allowance for
about 21.9% of base costs of imported equipment. Price escalation was calcu-
lated on the basis of foreign equipment costs increases of 7.5% each in 1977
and 1978, and 7% a year thereafter. No price increases are assumed since
orders for local equipment and civil works will be placed on a fixed price
basis in 1977-early 1978 and no price revisions are expected until then.
7.03      Civil construction costs are based on the physical quantities esti-
mated by the Design Center and the unit construction cost rates established
by the Government. Since substantial engineering work has been completed
and because unit rates are not likely to change significantly through 1980,
the estimated cost of civil construction is considered reasonable. The total
cost estimates include a relatively small provision for physical contingen-
cies of about 7.4% of base costs, since in the Romanian system changes in
project scope and cost are normally not permitted after project approval,
which has already been given, and because project engineering is at a rela-
tively advanced stage. The estimated total project costs are considered
realistic (Annex 7-3).



- 23 -
B.   Working Capital
7.04      The project cost estimates include a provision for incremental work-
ing capital of Lei 178.2 million (Annex 7-4). Working capital was calculated
on the basis of Brasov's current practices and after considering the expected
improvements in inventory control as a result of a) the proposed introduc-
tion of a computer system for production control; and b) due to the improved
throughput of the plant after the introduction of the Hi-Volume production
line. However, since Brasov has not yet undertaken a detailed study of the
potential benefits that can be derived from this computer introduction in
reducing its working capital requirements, an agreement has been obtained
that the Enterprise will complete such a study before March 31, 1978.
C.   Financing Plan
7.05      The total financing requirements of the project (Annex 7-5) of Lei
1,861.8 million (US$93.1 million) are proposed to be met as follows:
Proposed Financing Plan
(Millions)
---------Lei ---------    -----US Dollars------
Local  Foreign  Total    Local   Foreign Total
IBRD Loan                         -      760.0   760.0       -        38.0   38.0
State Funds                      28.8   105.8   134.6        1.5       5.3    6.8
Funds Retained from Operations 788.2        -    788.2      39.4        -    39.4
Funds for Working Capital       178.2       -    178.2       8.9        -     8.9
Total Financing                 995.2   865.8 1,861.0       49.8      43.3   93.1
7.06      The above financing plan assumes a Bank Loan of US$38.0 million to
cover the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project (exclusive of inter-
est during construction on the Bank loan) or about 43% of total project costs.
The balance of the financing required to meet such interest and local currency
expenditures, as well as additional funds to cover any unexpected cost over-
runs in local and/or foreign currency, will be provided by the State. Due to
the severe foreign exchange shortage in the country, the Romanian authorities
have set a value limit of about US$26 million equivalent on the direct imports
to be permitted for the project. However, considering the price increases pro-
jected during project implementation, it is estimated that these contemplated
imports would cost approximately US$31.5 million. To ensure that the project
remains technically acceptable and is executed along the lines presented to
the Bank, two complementary agreements have been obtained from the Government:
that: (a) the specific equipment, spares and related services to be imported
that were presented to and agreed with the Bank (Annex 7-3, Attachment I)
would remain essentially unchanged, unless otherwise agreed to by the Bank;
and (b) the Government would agree to permit imports above the limit currently
set by it in case this becomes technically necessary.



- 24 -
7.07      The Bank loan is proposed to be extended to the Investment Bank
for 13 years, including 3 years of grace, at the prevailing interest rate.
As in the case of other Bank projects in Romania, the Investment Bank would
pass on the loan proceeds to the Enterprise, together with the State Funds,
as equity. However, assurances have been obtained that annual depreciation
remittances and benefits will be sufficient to cover (notional) payments of
interest and principal on the Bank loan assumed to be identical to those due
to the Bank, except for an interest rate of 10%.
D.   Procurement
7.08      The Bank loan would finance the foreign currency cost (Romanian
border or port of entry) of imported equipment, spares and related services,
and FOB ex-factory cost of local equipment spares and related services. The Bank
financed items would be divided into about 30 equipment packages and be pro-
cured through international competitive bidding in conformity with Bank guide-
lines, except for items, not exceeding US$1.7 million in total value, which
are estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent each or which are not
suitable for procurement through ICB for technical reasons. These latter
items will be procured by prudent international shopping, in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Agreement has been reached that
the specific items of equipment, spares and related services listed in Annex
7.3, Attachment I, and considered critical to the project's technical via-
bility, would be imported from Bank member countries and Switzerland, and
that both foreign and Romanian suppliers will participate in the interna-
tional competitive bidding of items to be selected from those listed in
Annex 7.3, Attachment II. Bank financing of the latter items will be lim-
ited to the estimated total indirect foreign exchange cost of the project.
For purposes of bid comparison, Romanian suppliers participating in ICB will
be accorded a 15% preference. Romanian suppliers are expected to win most
of the bids in which they participate. Local equipment, civil works and
services to be financed by the Government would be procured according to
Romanian procedures, which are considered satisfactory for this purpose
(paras. 6.03 and 7.02).
7.09      The detailed equipment lists have been prepared and the bid pack-
ages are being finalized. Prequalification is expected to be completed by
June 1977 and most bids received between August 1977 and February 1978. This
assumes that only single stage bidding will be employed. A detailed descrip-
tion of contemplated procurement arrangements and lists of equipment to be
procured under the loan are given in Annex 7-7.
E.   Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursements
7.10      The allocation of loan proceeds will be as below:



- 25 -
Allocation of Bank Loan

Category               Amount of Loan Allocated   to be Financed
-----(US$ million)------
I. Imported equipment,
machinery, spares                                    100% of foreign
and related services              26.0               expenditures
II. Other agreed equipment,                              100% of foreign
machinery, spares and                                expenditures or 100% of
services                           6.5               ex-factory cost of local
expenditures.
III. Unallocated                         5.5
38.0
An understanding has been reached with the Government that the unallocated
amount can be utilized only for agreed goods and services covered by Cate-
gory I. However, should, contrary to current expectations, the import cost
of items eligible under Category I be less than the US$31.5 million made
available for them (US$26,0 million plus US$5.5 million), a part of the loan,
equivalent to the resultant reduction in the total foreign exchange cost of
the project, will be cancelled.
7.11      A forecast of estimated quarterly disbursements is given in Annex 7-6.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates from the Project
8.01      Under the project, production volume would increase from its 1976
level of 20.0 million bearings to the full capacity level of 33.5 million
in 1985, and the average sales price, in constant 1976 terms, would increase
marginally from 46.5 to 49.2 lei/unit, due to the shift in the product mix
toward slightly larger and higher-priced bearings. Total revenues from the
project would increase from Lei 986 million (US$49.8 million) in 1976 (in-
cluding bearing parts sales) to Lei 1,650 million (US$82.5 million) in 1985,
as described in detail in Annex 8-1.
8.02       As mentioned earlier, a key objective of the project is to increase
production efficiency and reduce production costs. After project completion,
unit production costs are expected to decrease by 8% despite the planned shift
to heavier and thus more expensive bearings. For the high-volume type bear-
ings, variable production costs as a percentage of revenues would decrease
by 13% in spite of the assumed 5% per annum wage increase; this is mainly a
result of mass production technology which is expected to substantially reduce
direct labor costs (by 41%) and material consumption (by 17%). The low-volume
type bearings are also projected to show a small (6%) decrease in cost of pro-
duction, because of an expected 35% decline in maintenance costs and a 28%
decrease in indirect labor costs primarily due to economies of scale. The
projected reduction in operating costs is discussed in Annex 8-2.

/a   From 1976, both unit revenues and costs increase due to the recent price

- 27 -
8.05      Benefit as a percentage of revenues (rentability) declines from
24% in 1977 to 18.6% in 1979 because of initial inefficiencies in the project
after start-up. As productivity improves and the interest burden falls, the
rentability climbs to a level of 32% in 1985. The (notional) debt service
coverage on the Bank loan remains ample throughout; similarly the current
and debt/equity ratios remain satisfactory during the forecast period.
C.   Major Risks, Breakeven Point and Financial Returns
8.06      Because of the centrally planned economy, many of the normal risks
of operation of a business do not exist in Romania. Risks of work stoppages
due to strikes are absent. The process and technology being adopted for the
project components have been successfully used in other parts of the world
for many years and also in other enterprises within Romania. Therefore, the
process risks are believed to be small, though some of the equipment to be
supplied to the project would be manufactured in Romania for the first time
and thus entails some technical risks. Moderate risks exist for possible
delays in project completion and for cost overruns due to increases in the
cost of imported items; in case the Government tries to accommodate such in-
creases by shifting some items from imports to local supply, it may increase
the technical risks. The Bank plans to closely supervise the project to
minimize such risks. Regarding market risks, the major consumers of bearings
in Romania are committed to buying the agreed output at fixed prices through
the mechanism of Five Year Plans; the risk of losing market share to other
producers is also non-existent. Planned sales to centrally planned economies
are also assured through COMECON agreements. Of course in case these econo-
mies, as a whole, grow slower than expected, bearing sales would also suffer.
However, the domestic market forecasts are considered conservative and should
be easily achieved barring an unexpected major disruption in the Romanian
economy. The major risk is linked to the export markets in the Western
countries. However, considering the small proportion of bearings to be ex-
ported to convertible currency countries (by volume about 15% of Brasov's pro-
duction in 1980-1985 and by value even less), its impact on the Enterprise's
total revenues and profitability is small. Moreover, it is estimated that
over half of these export sales will be to international bearing companies
through already agreed product buy-back or other long-term sales agreements.
Therefore the project's market risk is considered acceptable and, as a con-
sequence also, its financial risk moderately low.
8.07      The variable costs as a percentage of total production costs are
estimated at 66%, giving a profit breakeven capacity utilization level of
40% or 13.2 million units. A detailed break-even analysis of the two proj-
ect components is given in Annex 8-8.
8.08      The financial rate of return for the project is estimated at 14.5%
in current terms (Annex 8-9).  However, considering that in Romania all prices
are administered, the internal rate of return is not a criterion for investment
decisions and, since all productive enterprises are state-owned, it is also
less meaningful than the project's impact on the State's fiscal resources
discussed below and an analysis of the project's economic rate of return
(Chapter IX).

D.   Fiscal Impact Analysis
8.09      In most Bank projects, a financial analysis of the borrower is
undertaken to determine if the borrower can bear the additional debt service
burden imposed by the financing needs of a project. In Romania, the State
not only bears the ultimate risk and responsibility of servicing the foreign
borrowings, but also has a policy of insulating its enterprises from the
impact of any such borrowing. Therefore, an analysis that measures the
impact of the proposed project on the State budget, along with the ability
of the budget to service the debt out of its cash flow from the project, is
considered more relevant. A projected fiscal impact statement for project
components is given in Annex 8-10 and summarized in the following table.
The project would contribute substantial amounts of cash to the State budget.
The lowest net contribution from the project would be in 1979 at Lei 60 mil-
lion, increasing to Lei 565 million by 1985. The debt service coverage by
the cashflow derived by the State from the project would be lowest at 4.8
times in 1982.

E.   Auditing and Reporting
8.10      Romania has a fairly elaborate control and audit system under which
enterprises submit periodic operational and financial reports to their Central,
the Technical Ministry and the banks concerned. The Centrals and the Techni-
cal Ministries, as well as a special unit in the Ministry of Finance and the
National and Investment Banks, conduct extensive audits of these reports to
ensure achievement of Plan targets and proper use of funds. Though the presen-
tation and contents of some of these reports is somewhat different from those
normally received by the Bank, it is not very difficult to adjust them to pro-
vide sufficient information for the Bank to adequately monitor the progress of
project implementation and operations. It has been agreed that Brasov will
submit quarterly and annual project progress and financial statements in a



- 29 -
format satisfactory to the Bank and that the Bank will receive copies of
annual audit reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance, within 45 days of
the end of the reporting period.
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Benefits and Costs
9.01      For calculating the economic benefits and costs, international
prices have been used for tradeable goods and services, and domestic prices
for non-tradeables. Economic benefits for bearings consumed within Romania
were calculated after considering the cheapest alternative source of bear-
ings supply. Since the cost of bearings imports from COMECON countries is
slightly less than from market oriented economies and also because Romania
has a surplus in its trade with COMECON countries, the least cost source for
domestically consumed bearings is considered to be COMECON, which can supply
most types of the bearings to be produced under the project. The bearings
for export to COMECON are priced at actual OCIR prices as used in the finan-
cial analysis, and those to convertible currency countries at their estimated
actual export price to these countries but with an adjustment for the addi-
tional export revenues expected due to the projected quality improvement. The
calculation of these economic benefits and costs is detailed in Annex 9-1.
9.02      In determining economic costs, special steel, which is the primary
raw material representing about half of total production costs, was priced
at international prices since: (a) even after the recent price resetting,
the domestic steel price is still about 22% lower than the cost of imported
special steel; and (b) Romania is a net importer of special steel. The
financial costs of other inputs (e.g. labor, maintenance materials, etc.)
are considered to fairly represent their economic costs and were therefore
used in determining the economic operating costs. In calculating the economic
investment costs, BAZA's additional working capital needs (38% of sales) have
been added to the cost of the project.
9.03      The unit costs of inputs are expected to increase at a rate faster
than the international price of bearings because increased competition in
the international market, along with some productivity gains, is likely to
prevent large increases in prices. These anticipated structural changes in
the relative costs and benefits in real terms, described in Annex 9-1, are
taken into account in the economic analysis.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
9.04      The rate of return of the project is calculated at 15.6%, composed
of an 22.1% return of the Hi-Volume component and one of 14.2% for the Low-
Volume component.  A sensitivity analysis is summarized below and detailed in
Annex 9-2. The return would remain satisfactory (13.2%) even in the unlikely
event of a 50% drop in export volume (or prices) to market economies, which
is equivalent to an approximately 5% drop in total revenues.

Revenues Decrease 5%                                                 13.2%

Revenues Decrease 10%                                                10.6%
Project Cost Increase 10%                                            12.9%
C.   Competitiveness
9.05      On the whole, the Romanian bearings industry appears competitively
well-placed in its domestic market compared to bearings manufacturers in
developed countries. Its basic advantage lies in the very low skilled labor
costs in Romania compared to North America and Western Europe (approximately
US$0.75 per hour vs. US$8.00). While this wage advantage is partly offset by
much lower productivity (para. 5.14), the country still enjoys a significant
advantage in total labor costs, particularly considering the total absence of
strikes. The Romanian industry also has an important advantage in production
planning since production enterprises are given detailed delivery schedules
for the full year in advance, facilitating maximum capacity utilization
throughout. Thus, despite some inbuilt excess capacity, on balance Romanian
production plants can have better capacity utilization. Finally, the almost
total absence of local marketing costs should result in considerable savings
though the present apparent lack of application engineering does lead to some
suboptimum use of bearings. Most of these cost advantages relate to the
domestic market and can be realized only if the domestic product mix does
not lead to poor equipment utlization (para. 5.13). But, in the competitive
export markets, the lower costs alone do not appear adequate to overcome the
shortcomings in the marketing effort. To take full advantage of the export
potential, the Romanian industry urgently needs to improve its marketing
organization as mentioned earlier in para 4.23.
D.   Foreign Exchange Savings and Other Economic Benefits
9.06      The project would require a direct foreign exchange investment of
about US$38 million and would annually save and/or earn foreign exchange of
about US$35 million after project completion. The project would provide about
500 additional direct jobs in the Enterprise and an additional cash flow to
the State budget of about Lei 236 million per year after foreign debt service,
on an effective total equity investment of about Lei 312 million.
9.07      Under the project the quality of Romanian bearings would be sub-
stantially increased, thereby improving the competitiveness of the bearings
industry in world markets. Indirectly, it would also improve the quality of
machinery, machine tools, automobiles and other industrial goods in which
bearings are a small but critical part. The project would also make Romania
more self-sufficient in bearings and introduce latest production technology
in an important industry, thus meeting two important objectives of Romania's
current development plan.
