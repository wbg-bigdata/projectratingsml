A. 
Program Purpose and Project Development Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose and 
program 
phasing: 
The 
Government 
of 
Malawi 
is 
embarking 
on 
service 
delivery 
reforms 
driven 
by 
the 
Malawi 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper (MPRSP), 
Decentralization 
Policy, 
and 
in 
the context 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
(MDGs) 
for 
Malawi. 
In 
a 
three-phased 
Adaptable Program 
Loan 
(APL), 
interventions 
will 
be implemented aimed 
at 
assisting 
Malawi 
incrementally 
attain 
targets 
for 
12 
indicators 
under 
the 
MDGs 
- 
selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
service 
packages 
designed 
by 
sector 
ministries 
taking 
into 
account 
capacities 
available 
within 
communities, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs)/community 
based 
organizations 
(CBOs), 
and 
Local 
Authorities 
(LAs) 
in 
Malawi. 
The overall 
purpose 
of 
the 
Program 
(2003-2015) 
is 
to improve 
service 
delivery 
by 
communities 
supported 
by 
Local 
Governments 
and 
Sector 
Ministries through 
the 
Community-Driven 
Development 
(CDD) 
approach, 
and 
within 
the 
MPRSP framework 
so 
that 
Malawi 
can 
progressively 
move 
towards 
the 
attainment 
of 
12 
MDG 
indicator 
targets. 
The long-term 
goal 
is 
for 
Government 
to 
achieve sustainable 
poverty reduction 
while 
building 
the 
capacity 
of 
communities 
for 
self-reliance, 
and 
promote 
transparency 
and accountability 
among 
CBOsMGOs 
and 
LAs 
in 
the 
way 
they 
plan 
and 
implement 
development 
activities 
in 
the 
Districts. 
The 
program 
recognizes that a 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
poverty reduction 
will 
need 
to 
be dynamic 
in 
responding 
to 
community 
demands 
(as 
the 
risks 
they 
face 
change) 
by: 
(a) 
providing 
safety 
nets 
for 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
within 
communities; 
(b) 
deepening 
decentralization through 
capacity 
building 
for 
the 
demand-driven 
delivery 
of 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
social 
services (health, education, 
water 
and 
sanitation) 
in 
the 
Districts; 
and 
(c) 
stimulating 
a 
community 
savings 
and 
investment 
culture. 
Under 
MASAF 
3, 
the 
distributed 
nodes 
of 
social capital 
generated 
through 
MASAF 
I 
and 
I1 
will 
be 
networked 
to 
both 
optimize 
the 
social capital 
generated 
as 
well 
as 
to 
facilitate 
its 
incremental conversion 
into 
economic 
capital. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
through 
a 
three-phase 
Community 
Empowerment 
and 
Development Program 
(CEDP), 
which 
will 
strengthen the 
decentralization 
process 
by 
making 
community 
empowerment 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
District 
service 
delivery 
processes 
over 
a 
12 
year 
period 
(see 
Government letter 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
Annex 
11). 
The 
CEDP 
leverages 
the 
comparative 
advantage 
of 
social 
funds 
in 
empowering 
communities 
by 
addressing 
decentralization 
challenges 
between communities and 
LAs, 
but 
recognizes 
that 
it 
can 
be 
better 
aligned 
with 
the 
decentralization 
of 
central 
government 
to 
LAs 
(an 
area 
best 
addressed 
by 
Local 
Government 
reform 
instruments). 
Phase 
I 
of 
the 
program 
(2003-2006) 
will 
integrate 
community 
empowerment 
processes 
into 
district 
planning 
and 
deliverv 
of 
community 
service packagesIt 
will 
use experiences 
from 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
as 
well 
as 
sector-defined 
community 
service 
packages, 
to 
better 
align 
communities, CBOs/NGOs, 
and 
LAs 
with 
the 
District 
Development 
Planning 
Framework. 
Phase 
I1 
(2006-201 
1) 
will 
continue 
with 
the 
delivery 
of 
community 
service 
packages 
and promote 
accountability and 
measurement 
of 
MDG 
outputs 
for 
12 
indicators 
bv 
LAs. 
NGOs/CBOs, and communities. 
Phase 
I11 
(201 
1-2015) 
will 
build 
on 
activities 
from 
phase 
I1 
and 
institutionalize 
outcome-based 
reuorting 
by 
communities, 
NGOs/CBOs, and 
LAs 
- 
with 
60% 
of 
districts 
expected 
to 
attain 
targets 
for 
12 
MDG 
indicator 
targets. 
Overall, 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
each phase 
will 
feed 
into 
the 
strategies 
and 
approaches 
in 
the 
successor phase, 
resulting 
in 
adjustments, 
refinements, 
and 
redesigns. 
To 
achieve 
integrated 
and 
sustainable 
project 
outcomes, 
this 
phasing 
of 
the 
APL 
has 
been synchronized 
with 
the 
Medium-Term 
Expenditure 
Framework 
(MTEF) 
for 
implementing 
the 
MPRSP 
and the 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS). 
LAs 
who 
fully 
take 
over 
MASAF 
3 resource 
management 
will 
receive 
all 
MTEF 
resources needed 
to 
finance 
community 
service packages 
(once 
these are 
costed 
during 
APL 
I). 
The 
majority 
of 
triggers 
for 
the 
APL 
are 
based 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
Districts to 
take 
over 
this 
management 
of 
resources, 
deliver 
services, 
and 
report 
on 
outcomes 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
CAS, 
MPRSP, 
and 
MDGs.

was 
discussed 
by 
the 
Executive Directors 
on 
August 
27, 1998; a Progress 
Report 
(IDNR2000-224) 
was discussed

The 
principal 
instruments 
for 
achieving 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
the 
MDG 
goals 
in 
Malawi 
are 
decentralization and 
the 
MTEF 
using 
a 
CDD 
approach that 
uses 
the 
social 
action 
fund 
mechanisms. 
In 
its 
formulation 
of 
a 
Program 
Concept 
Document 
to 
meet 
the 
MPRSP 
goals, 
in 
January 
2002 
the 
Government 
of 
Malawi 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
a comprehensive 
program 
for 
co-financing 
and 
parallel 
funding 
under 
MASAF 
that 
is 
in 
line 
with 
Bank 
strategy 
to 
support 
multi-sectoral 
investments 
which 
can 
contribute 
to 
poverty 
reduction. 
This 
document 
outlines 
the 
use 
of 
targeted 
investments 
in 
a 
participatory, 
equitable 
and 
sustainable 
manner 
to incrementally 
reduce 
poverty 
in 
the country. 
Malawi 
is 
listed 
in 
Annex 
A 
of 
the 
IDA 
Grants 
Implementation 
Guidelines 
(IDAISecMZ.002-0460),  dated 
August 
8,2002, 
as 
a 
debt 
vulnerable 
country, 
eligible 
for 
Grant 
funding. 
The 
Grant 
funding 
under 
this 
Project 
represents 
the 
full 
amount available 
through 
the 
debt 
vulnerable 
window for 
Malawi 
for 
this 
fiscal 
year, 
US$27.2 
million 
(SDR20 
million). 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
momentum 
that 
could 
be 
created 
for 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
to 
support 
the 
vulnerable, 
as 
well 
as 
LAs 
to 
provide 
safety 
net 
programs 
for 
the 
able-bodied 
poor 
in 
their 
jurisdictions, 
a 
decision 
was 
taken 
to 
provide 
grant 
funding 
for 
the 
activities 
of 
this 
nature 
being 
funded 
under 
MASAF. 
This 
decision 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
Malawi 
CAS 
currently 
being 
finalized. 
The 
Grant 
funding 
will 
be 
utilized to 
finance 
community 
responses 
to 
risk 
and 
vulnerability, 
which 
will 
provide 
resources 
to 
vulnerable 
households 
through 
the 
SSP, 
and 
cash 
transfers 
through 
public 
works 
funded 
under the 
LAMP. 
These 
targeted 
poverty 
interventions 
are 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
downstream 
impact 
on both 
education and health 
outcomes. 
At 
the 
district 
level, 
the 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
adopted 
by 
MASAF 
will 
provide information 
on 
the 
number 
of 
sub-projects 
funded 
under 
SSP 
and 
LAMPs, 
their 
average 
costs, 
and 
the 
total 
number 
of 
beneficiaries 
reached 
with 
assistance 
by 
these 
projects. 
Information 
from 
Districts 
will 
be 
aggregated 
at 
the 
national 
level 
to 
produce a 
picture 
of 
total 
sub-projects 
funded, 
cost, 
and 
beneficiaries. 
This 
information 
will 
be 
analyzed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
SSPs 
and 
LAMPs 
relative 
to 
national 
need 
as 
identified 
in 
the MPRSP. 
Furthermore, 
the 
total 
number 
of 
beneficiaries 
will 
be 
put 
in 
the 
context 
of 
targets 
set 
for 
MDGs 
performance 
indicators 
and 
tracked 
over 
the 
life 
of 
this 
project, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
12 
year 
program 
being 
funded 
to 
assist 
communities contribute 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
selected 
MDG 
indicator 
targets. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Malawi 
is 
one 
of 
the 
poorest 
countries 
in 
the 
world, ranked 
170th 
out 
of 
174 countries 
in 
the 
2000 
United 
Nations 
Development 
Program 
Human 
Development 
Report, 
with 
a 
GNP 
per capita 
of 
US$180. 
An 
estimated 
65.3% 
of 
the 
population 
is 
below 
the 
poverty 
line, 
with 
poverty 
being 
endemic and widespread 
in 
the 
rural 
and 
peri-urban 
areas. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
66.5% 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
is 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
with, 
28.2% 
living 
in 
dire-poverty. 
The 
Malawi 
Integrated 
Household 
Survey 
of 
1998 
reported 
that 
about 54.9% 
of 
urban population 
live 
below 
the 
poverty 
line. 
Illiteracy 
levels 
are 
high, 
estimated at 
40.8% (36.2% 
males 
and 
54.7%  females). 
Life 
expectancy 
is 
estimated 
at 
37 
years 
while 
infant 
and 
child 
mortality 
rates 
are 
estimated 
at 
104 
and 
189 
per 
1,000 
respectively, 
and 
the 
maternal 
mortality 
rate 
has 
more than doubled between 
1992 
and 
2000: 
from 
620 
to 
1,200 
per 
100,000. 
According 
to 
the 
Malawi 
Demographic and 
Health 
Survey 
of 
2000, 
an 
estimated 
43% 
of 
the 
population 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
safe 
water 
supplies. 
Like 
many 
countries 
in 
Sub-Sahara 
Africa, 
Malawi's 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate 
is 
high: 
15% 
nationwide, 
with 
urban 
rates 
running 
as 
high 
as 
23%. 
The 
HIV/AIDS 
Annual 
Report produced 
by 
the 
National 
AIDS 
Commission 
in 
2002 
indicated 
that 
the 
pandemic 
has 
resulted 
in 
loss 
of 
life 
mainly 
of 
those 
in 
the 
productive 
age 
groups 
of 
15 
to 
49 
years. 
AIDS 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
orphans 
and severely 
strained 
the 
resources 
in 
the 
household and 
in 
the 
public 
health 
delivery 
system. 
The 
Government 
Decentralization 
Policy 
of 
1998 
called 
for 
the establishment 
of 
elected 
Authorities 
in 
district 
and 
urban 
centers, 
and 
devolution 
of 
significant central Government functions 
in 
order 
to improve 
service 
delivery. 
The 
four broad 
objectives 
of 
decentralization 
are 
to 
(a) 
create 
a democratic 
environment 
and institutions 
for 
development 
at 
the 
local level 
and 
facilitate 
the 
participation 
of 
-5- 
Page  10
grassroots 
in 
decision-making; 
(b) 
eliminate 
dual 
administrations 
at 
the 
district 
level 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
making 
the 
public 
service 
more 
efficient, 
economic and 
cost 
effective; 
(c) 
promote accountability 
and 
good 
governance 
at 
the 
local 
level 
in 
order 
to 
help 
Government 
reduce 
poverty, 
and 
(d) 
mobilize 
the 
population 
for 
socio-economic development 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
The 
strategy 
drawn 
up 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Local 
Government 
in 
2000 recognized that 
"decentralization 
is 
a 
long-term 
process, [and] 
the 
implementation 
process 
will 
cover a 
period 
of 
ten 
years 
divided 
into 
crash, 
medium, 
and long-term 
programme", 
which 
the 
proposed 
APL 
phases 
will 
complement 
by 
working 
with 
LAs 
in 
meeting 
benchmarks 
on 
delivering 
to 
communities 
within 
approved sectoral guidelines. 
The 
final 
draft 
(April 
2002) 
of 
the 
MPRSP 
provides 
the 
guiding 
framework 
for 
development 
assistance 
from 
various 
development 
partners. 
The 
overall 
goal 
of 
MPRSP 
is 
to 
achieve 
sustainable 
poverty 
reduction through 
social, 
economic and 
political 
empowerment of 
the 
poor, 
who 
would 
be 
in 
control 
of 
their 
own 
development 
with 
Government 
and 
the development partners' 
role 
being 
that 
of 
creating 
a 
conducive environment 
for 
reducing 
poverty. 
The 
MPRSP 
has 
four pillars: 
(a) 
sustainable 
pro-poor 
economic 
growth to 
economically 
empower 
the 
poor 
by 
ensuring 
access 
to 
credit 
and 
markets, 
skills 
development and 
employment 
generation; 
(b) 
human 
capital 
development 
for 
ensuring 
that 
the 
poor 
have 
the 
health 
status 
and education 
to 
lift 
themselves 
out 
of 
poverty; 
(c) 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
by 
providing 
sustainable 
safety 
nets for those 
who 
are 
unable 
to benefit 
from 
the 
first 
two 
pillars; 
and 
(d) 
good 
governance, 
political 
will 
and 
mindset 
which 
will 
ensure 
that 
public 
and 
civil 
society 
institutions 
and 
systems 
protect and 
benefit 
the 
poor. 
These 
pillars 
are 
supported 
by 
four 
cross-cutting 
issues 
- 
HIVIAIDS, 
gender, 
environment and technology 
development. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
is 
going 
to 
implement 
the 
MPRSP through 
three-year 
MTEF 
cycles, 
and the 
MASAF 
APL 
phases are 
synchronized 
with 
the 
MTEF 
processes 
as 
a 
key 
strategy 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
meet 
its 
MDGs 
within 
the 
MPRSP. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
MASAF 
was 
established 
in 
1995, 
before 
the 
decentralization 
policy 
was 
introduced, 
and 
as 
a 
result 
it 
was 
working 
directly 
with 
communities 
and 
district 
teams 
of 
civil 
servants. Sector 
ministries 
at 
national 
level 
viewed 
the 
MASAF 
Project 
as 
a 
parallel 
structure, 
with 
the 
consequence 
that 
there 
was inadequate 
support 
from 
sectors 
during 
project 
implementation, 
as 
well 
as 
support 
for 
recurrent 
costs 
after 
project 
completion. 
Until 
the 
Decentralization 
Framework 
was 
put 
in 
place 
in 
November 
2000, 
the 
public 
works 
program collegial 
approach 
(staff 
in 
District 
Commissioner's 
Office, 
District 
Council 
and 
the 
Sector 
Ministries) 
pooled 
available 
management resources 
at 
District-level 
and 
distributed 
tasks 
according 
to 
institutional 
strengths. 
Although 
this consultative 
nature 
of 
decision-making 
processes was 
meant 
to 
ensure 
that 
checks 
and 
balances 
were 
in 
place, 
it 
proved 
inadequate 
in 
delivering 
optimal 
services. 
It 
is 
only 
after 
the 
November 
2000 
Assembly 
elections that the 
three 
institutions (District 
Commissioners 
Office, 
LAs, 
and 
Sector 
Ministries) 
were 
brought 
under 
one 
office 
where 
the 
checks 
and 
balances 
envisaged 
in 
the 
initial 
set-up 
could be 
realized 
through 
the 
direct supervision 
of 
LAs. 
In 
order 
to 
improve 
sectoral 
linkages 
without losing 
MASAF 
I 
and 
I1 
gains 
in 
community 
empowerment, 
the 
project 
will 
adopt a phased approach 
to 
integrating 
its 
operations 
into 
the 
District 
Development 
Planning 
Framework 
adopted 
by 
LAs 
- 
helping 
each 
LA 
meet agreed 
delivery 
benchmarks 
defined 
by 
each sector. 
The 
design 
of 
MASAF 
has 
in 
the 
past 
allowed 
communities 
to 
work 
with 
facilitators 
in 
those 
aspects 
of 
the 
project cycle 
for 
which 
they need 
assistance, 
such 
as 
project 
identification, 
filling 
application forms 
and 
implementation. 
Local 
leaders 
(parliamentarians, 
headmen, 
and 
traditional 
chiefs), 
Government 
officials, 
teachedhead 
teachers, 
church 
leaders, 
NGOs/CBOs 
and 
individuals 
have 
all 
been 
facilitators. 
The 
success 
of 
projects 
depends 
on 
the 
quality 
and timeliness 
of 
facilitation 
at 
the 
inception 
of 
a 
proposal, 
transparent 
election 
of 
the 
project 
management 
committee (PMC) 
and 
quality 
of 
supervision. 
The 
role 
of 
Local 
Government 
(LAs) 
and 
NGOs/CBOs 
in 
Participatory 
Rural Action 
(PRA) 
processes 
-6- 
Page  11
remains a 
major 
challenge 
for Local 
Government planning, 
and 
MASAF 
will 
deliver 
intensive 
and 
timely 
capacity 
building 
to 
LAs 
so 
that 
the 
Authorities 
can 
actively participate 
in 
the 
CDD 
approach, 
and 
in 
turn 
MASAF 
supported 
activities 
can 
be harmonized 
with 
the 
on-going decentralization efforts. 
The 
Public 
Works 
Program 
in 
MASAF 
I 
experimented 
with 
two 
modes 
of 
payment: 
cash 
and food. 
Where 
a 
combination 
of 
food 
and 
cash was 
used, 
there 
were 
problems 
in 
the 
management 
of 
food 
distribution 
because 
too many 
actors 
were 
involved 
to 
make 
it 
work. 
The 
result 
was 
that 
food 
was 
often 
delayed 
or 
even 
not 
delivered 
to 
the 
sites. 
In 
MASAF 
11, 
all 
payments 
were 
made 
in 
cash even 
though 
the 
Beneficiary 
Assessments 
indicated 
that 
benficiaries 
would 
still 
prefer 
a 
combination 
of 
foodlcashlinputs 
depending 
on 
the 
time 
of 
the 
year. 
MASAF 
has 
not 
been able 
to 
respond 
because 
of 
the 
difficulties 
in 
the 
logistics 
of 
distributing 
food 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
national 
framework 
to 
address 
issues 
of 
household 
food, 
nutrition, 
and economic 
insecurity. 
Under 
MASAF 
3-CEDP, 
communities 
will 
be 
supported 
to 
implement 
household-level 
strategies 
to 
increase 
food 
production 
and consumption 
as 
well 
as 
improve 
access 
to off-farm 
incomes. 
The 
strategy 
of 
handing 
over 
MASAF 
responsibility 
to 
LAs 
within 
the 
MTEF 
will 
ensure 
that 
sector 
reforms 
are 
in 
place 
to 
overcome 
the 
problem 
of 
inadequate 
recurrent, operation, 
and 
maintenance 
resources. 
A 
number 
of 
sectors 
have 
defined 
essential 
community 
service 
packages 
which 
communities 
can 
implement 
with 
support 
from 
LAs 
to 
meet 
the 
most 
basic 
needs. 
In 
health, a 
Community 
Essential 
Health 
Package 
will 
ensure 
that 
alternative 
health 
interventions 
can 
be 
supported 
so 
that communities 
are 
not 
solely 
relying 
on 
construction 
of 
health 
facilities. 
In 
education, 
the 
emphasis 
will 
be 
on 
combining 
construction 
with 
improved 
education 
outcomes 
by 
making 
available 
to 
communities 
a comprehensive 
education 
package. 
The 
same 
will 
be 
done 
for 
water 
and sanitation 
so 
that 
improved 
water 
and 
sanitation 
are 
part 
of 
a 
community 
service package. 
Implementation 
of 
these 
packages, 
which 
constitute a 
minimum 
set 
of 
affordable interventions 
for 
community-level 
management 
within 
national 
sector 
norms, 
will 
assist 
communities 
in 
contributing to 
the 
achievement 
of 
12 
MDG 
indicator 
targets 
for 
Malawi. 
The 
challenge 
of 
pervasive 
poverty 
in 
Malawi 
still 
remains, 
resulting 
in 
overwhelming 
demand 
for 
community 
development 
projects 
from 
MASAF. 
Communities 
have 
been unable 
to 
mobilize 
savings, 
and 
this 
has 
impacted 
negatively 
on 
government-community 
partnership 
in 
service 
delivery. 
MASAF 
will 
promote 
savings clubs, 
which 
are 
more community 
responsive 
than 
the 
current 
alternatives 
available 
in 
Malawi, 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
new rural 
investment 
culture 
to improve 
incomes among 
the 
poor, 
enabling 
communities 
to 
manage 
risk 
more effectively. 
This 
will 
be part 
of 
a comprehensive 
community 
food 
and 
economic 
security 
package 
which 
supports 
vulnerable 
persons 
with 
grants, 
while 
giving 
their 
foster 
households 
opportunities 
to 
save 
and 
escape 
from 
chronic 
poverty 
and 
hunger. 
Within 
this 
package, cash 
transfers 
through 
LAMPS 
will 
be 
a 
particularly important 
mechanisms 
for 
reaching the 
able-bodied 
poor.

Program 
description 
and 
performance triggers for 
subsequent loans: 
This 
12 
year 
APL 
is 
expected 
coincide 
with 
the 
target 
for 
attaining 
the 
MDGs 
(2015), 
by 
which 
time 
LAs 
will 
have 
taken over 
the 
implementation 
of 
community-managed investments 
with 
their 
own 
staff 
as 
MASAF 
reduces 
its 
staffing 
levels 
in 
line 
with 
increasing 
LA 
capacities. 
The 
implementation 
of 
interventions 
will 
continue throughout 
the 
12 
year 
period, 
with 
the 
Program goal 
being:

Program and Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
MASAF 
3 
- 
CEDP 
will 
have 
five 
components: 
1. 
Managed 
Projects 
(CMPs), 
and 
(b) 
LAMPs. 
This 
component 
will 
support demand-driven and 
community-based socio-economic 
infrastructure, 
with 
improved facilitation 
to 
allow 
communities 
to 
articulate 
their 
priority 
development 
concerns 
within 
the 
social 
fund 
criteria 
and 
the 
District 
Development 
Planning 
Framework. 
CMPs 
will 
be 
single 
community 
sub-projects managed 
by 
the 
community, 
who 
are 
required 
to 
contribute 
a 
minimum 
of 
20% 
of 
total project 
cost 
in 
cash 
or 
kind. 
LAMPs, which 
have 
a 
safety 
net 
element 
while 
creating 
assets, 
will 
be 
multi-community 
and require 
labor-intensive 
technologies 
to 
implement; 
these 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
LAs. 
The 
component 
is 
based 
on 
the 
five 
community 
service 
packages 
of 
health, education, 
transport 
and 
communication, 
food 
security, and 
water 
and 
sanitation 
- 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
various 
sectors 
and implemented 
by 
LAs, 
CBOs, 
and 
communities. 
Eligible 
sub-projects 
are 
those 
that 
will 
deliver 
a 
community 
good 
rather than 
provide 
individual 
benefit 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
basic 
social 
services 
in 
health, 
education and 
water; 
afforestation, 
terracing, 
community 
roads 
and 
bridges, 
community 
centers, 
food 
processing technologies, 
energy 
efficiency 
interventions, training, and 
others. 
For 
CMPs, 
the 
average 
cost 
of 
a 
subproject 
is 
estimated 
at 
$20,000 
from 
IDA 
contribution, and 
the 
timeframe 
for 
implementing 
subprojects 
is 
12 
months. 
The 
average 
cost 
of 
LAMPs 
is 
estimated at 
US$40,000 
from 
IDA 
contributions, 
where 
a 
minimum 
of 
40% 
of 
funds 
paid 
by 
MASAF 
is 
for 
unskilled 
labor. 
All 
sub-projects 
within 
these averages 
shall be 
appraised 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
District 
Executive 
Committee 
(DEC) 
(as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
within 
the 
district 
plan 
approved 
by 
the 
LA) 
and 
endorsed 
by 
the 
LAs 
during 
their 
regular 
meetings. 
Any 
sub-projects 
outside 
the 
service 
norms and 
above 
the sub-project 
average cost 
shall 
be 
desk 
and 
field 
appraised 
by 
the 
respective 
sector 
supported 
by 
the 
MASAF 
Zone 
Office 
(ZO) 
and 
Management 
Unit 
(MU). 
For 
these 
sub-projects 
the 
National 
Technical 
Advisory 
Committee 
(NTAC) 
shall 
review 
and 
approve 
for 
endorsement 
by 
the 
Board provided 
that 
the 
sub-projects 
are 
within 
the 
funding 
envelope 
of 
the 
given 
district. 
In 
no 
event, unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA'S 
contribution 
to 
a 
CMP 
or 
a 
LAMP 
exceed an 
amount 
equivalent 
to 
US$60,000. 
Once 
a 
LA 
has 
developed 
the 
capacity 
(measured 
by 
pre-agreed benchmarks) 
to 
deliver 
sub-projects 
under 
the 
LAMP 
window, 
resources 
from 
the 
CMP 
window 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
Authority 
for 
disbursement 
to PMCs 
- 
and 
all 
such resources 
will 
be 
monitored through 
agreed 
benchmarks 
and 
the 
results 
regularly published 
in 
the 
local 
press. 
The 
successful 
integration 
of 
CDP 
into 
LA 
management 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
a 
Joint 
MASAF-Local 
The 
Communitv 
Development 
Projects 
(CDPs) 
will 
have 
financing windows 
for 
(a)

The Social 
Support 
Program 
(SSP) 
directly 
targets 
vulnerable 
groups 
(such 
as 
widows, 
widowers, 
the 
aged, 
orphans 
and 
foster 
parents, 
the 
destitute, 
the 
disabled, persons 
affected 
by 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
malnourished 
under-fives) 
through 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
with 
a 
history 
of 
working 
with 
such 
groups. 
The 
component stimulates and 
supports 
traditional coping 
systems, 
which 
rely 
on 
the 
extended 
family, 
when 
foster 
households experience 
deepening 
poverty 
after 
taking 
in 
vulnerable 
individuals. 
Funding 
is 
available 
for 
the 
development 
of 
long-term 
capacity 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
NGOs/CBOs 
working 
directly 
with 
these 
vulnerable 
groups 
and foster 
households. 
Activities 
to 
be 
funded 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
specific 
needs 
of 
the 
vulnerable 
group, 
and, 
based 
on 
previous 
experience, 
include 
initiatives 
that 
contribute 
to 
household 
food 
and 
nutrition 
security, support 
in 
skills 
provision, 
special 
training 
depending 
on 
needs, 
provision 
of 
grants 
for 
tools and 
other 
productive 
assets 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
community-level 
interventions, 
and 
stimulation 
of 
productive 
activities 
for 
foster 
households. 
The 
menu 
of 
sub-projects 
will 
expand 
as 
communities 
demand 
new 
and 
appropriate 
interventions 
in 
response 
to 
changes 
in 
the nature 
of 
risks 
affecting 
foster 
households 
and vulnerable 
individuals. 
The 
sub-projects 
shall 
be 
appraised 
and 
approved 
by 
a 
District 
Technical 
Team, 
comprised 
of 
the 
DEC 
and 
CSOINGOICBO 
members, 
as 
long 
as 
these 
sub-projects 
are 
within 
the 
district 
plan 
approved 
by 
the 
LA. 
The 
sub-projects 
will 
be 
endorsed 
by 
NTAC 
for 
forwarding 
to 
the 
Board. 
Funding 
will 
be 
contingent 
upon 
NGOs/CBOs 
meeting 
eligibility 
criteria, 
which 
includes 
a 
cash, 
or 
in-kind 
contribution 
of 
20% 
(from 
the 
Project Implementing 
Agency, 
and 
the 
community 
if 
they 
are 
able 
to 
contribute), 
and 
the 
activity falls 
within 
the 
sub-project 
menu. 
The 
average cost 
of 
IDA's 
contribution 
to 
SSP 
sub-projects 
is 
US$lO,OOO. 
Any 
sub-project outside 
the 
service 
norms and 
above 
the sub-project 
average cost 
shall 
be 
desk 
and 
field 
appraised 
by 
the respective 
sector 
supported 
by 
the 
ZO 
and 
MU. 
In 
no 
event, 
unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA's 
contribution 
to 
an 
SSP 
exceed 
an 
amount 
equivalent 
to 
US$30,000. 
3. 
The 
Community 
Savings 
and Investment 
Promotion 
(COMSIP) 
will 
finance 
community 
mobilization 
for 
savings, 
training 
on 
improved 
business 
skills, 
and 
provision 
of 
80% 
costs 
towards 
the 
construction 
of 
required 
infrastructure 
for 
a 
Savings 
Club; 
but 
it 
will 
not 
provide 
funds 
for 
lending. 
The 
component 
builds 
on 
experiences 
from 
the 
SSP 
component 
of 
MASAF 
I1 
where groups have increased 
their 
capacity 
to 
generate 
incomes 
and 
used 
it 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
orphans 
and other 
vulnerable 
persons 
living 
within 
households, 
or 
sometimes 
in 
community-owned 
facilities, 
and 
also saved 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
unexpected 
expenses 
(e.g. 
illness). 
The 
component 
will 
promote 
the 
formation 
of 
Community 
Savings 
and Investment Groups (COMSIGs) 
of 
10-15 
members 
each; 
10 
COMSIGS 
can come together 
to 
form 
Community 
Savings 
and 
Investment 
Clubs (COMSICs). 
The 
participants 
will 
receive 
training 
and 
business 
management 
skills, 
and be 
linked 
to 
legally-constituted 
micro-finance institutions 
(MFIs) 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
poor 
operate 
in 
a 
viable 
and 
sustainable savings 
and 
credit 
environment. 
The 
promotion 
of 
COMSIGs 
and COMSICs, and 
piloting 
community-MFI 
interfaces 
will 
be 
phased 
to 
ensure 
that a 
sustainable savings 
and 
investment 
framework 
for 
the 
poor 
is 
in 
place. 
While 
COMSIGS 
will 
be 
free 
to 
lend 
to their 
own 
members 
in 
line 
with 
their 
rules, 
MASAF 
will 
also 
provide them 
with 
information 
on 
private providers 
of 
market-driven micro-finance 
services. 
The 
estimated 
average cost 
for 
the 
simple 
infrastructure 
required 
by 
a 
COMSIC 
is 
US$lO,OOO 
from 
IDA 
contribution. 
A 
PMC 
will 
be 
democratically 
elected 
and 
responsible 
for 
applying 
for 
funds 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
COMSIC, 
as 
well 
as 
ensuring 
that 
the 
20% 
required 
contribution 
is 
provided. 
Appraisal 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
DEC, 
and, 
during 
Phase 
I 
of 
the 
Project, 
approvals 
will 
be undertaken 
at 
MU 
level; 
proposed 
changes 
to 
the 
approval 
process 
will 
be 
reviewed 
during 
the 
migration 
from 
Phase 
I 
to 
11. 
In 
no 
event, 
unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA's 
contribution to 
a 
COMSIC 
exceed 
an 
amount equivalent 
to 
US$lO,OOO. 
4. 
Transparencv 
and 
Accountability 
Promotion (TAP) 
is 
a cross-cutting component 
to 
capacitate 
-9- 
Page  14
implementing 
agencies 
to 
assist 
Malawi 
in 
achieving 
the 
MDG 
targets 
in 
a transparent 
and 
sustainable 
manner, 
It 
will 
document and 
transform 
MASAF's 
experiences 
from 
working 
with 
communities 
into 
capacity 
enhancement 
interventions 
which 
can support various partners 
implementing 
decentralization 
(such 
as 
LAs), 
and 
the 
MPRSP 
(such 
as 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs). 
It 
will 
develop suitable 
technical 
guidelines, 
generate data 
from 
the 
work 
of 
communities and 
partner 
institutions, 
process 
such 
data 
into 
useful 
information, 
disseminate, 
and 
package 
it 
into 
suitable 
materials 
for 
training. 
This 
component 
will 
develop appropriate tools 
for 
promoting 
community-level 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
through 
a 
suitable development 
communication 
strategy 
and 
equip 
communities 
with 
skills 
to 
demand 
the 
same 
from 
LAs 
and 
other 
institutions, 
as 
well 
as 
developing 
a 
community-level 
monitoring 
system 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
community 
service 
packages. 
It 
will 
finance 
the 
training 
of 
MASAF 
staff, 
district 
agencies, 
NGOs/CBOs 
and 
PMCs 
in 
the use 
of 
procedures, 
systems 
and 
criteria 
developed 
to 
improve 
implementation. 
A 
Technical 
Support 
Services 
Framework 
will 
be 
put 
in 
place 
by 
MASAF 
in 
partnership 
with 
LAs 
and 
respective 
sector 
ministries 
to 
ensure 
that 
norms and 
standards 
are 
responsive 
to 
community 
capacities. 
Within 
MASAF, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
Senior 
Engineer, 
6 
Zone 
Engineers, 
and 
LA 
level 
Technical 
Officers 
making 
up 
a 
Technical 
Support Service responsible 
for 
quality control 
in 
all 
MASAF 
supported 
infrastructure 
investments. 
Appropriate Memoranda 
of 
Understanding 
will 
be 
entered 
into 
with 
those sector 
ministries 
without 
an immediate 
devolution 
plan. 
The 
component 
will 
finance 
secretariat 
support 
to 
the 
National 
Advocacy 
Committee 
for 
Community 
Empowerment 
and 
Accountability (NACCEA), 
chaired 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Economic Planning 
and 
Development, 
to 
review monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
reports, 
make recommendations 
to 
the 
MASAF 
Board, and 
disseminate 
results 
on 
community, 
LA, 
and 
sector 
ministry 
performance 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
community 
service 
packages 
and 
progress 
towards 
attaining 
the 12 
MDG 
targets. 
All 
MASAF 
activities 
will 
strengthen 
technical 
standards 
for 
improved 
quality, and 
a 
system 
to 
collect, 
analyze, 
and 
disseminate 
information 
on 
progress 
and 
impacts. 
This 
component 
will 
also 
develop 
an 
effective 
management 
information 
system 
(MIS) 
which 
will 
feed 
into 
the 
overall 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
where 
the outputs 
of 
these 
sub-systems, 
along 
with 
the development 
communication initiative, 
will 
form 
a 
Knowledge 
and 
Information 
Sharing 
System 
(KISS) and 
make 
MASAF 
a 
learning organization 
as 
it 
transforms 
into 
a 
training and 
capacity 
building 
institution 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
CDD 
approach. 
Component 
5. 
MASAF 
to 
deliver 
in 
a transparent 
and 
accountable 
way 
by 
financing 
the 
continued 
provision 
of 
technically 
competent 
staff 
to 
work 
at 
the 
MASAF 
MU, 
and 
strengthen 
LAs 
in 
implementing 
the 
community 
sub-project 
cycle 
with 
technical and 
financial 
expertise. 
Financial accountability 
and 
community 
procurement 
procedures already 
in 
place 
under 
MASAF 
I1 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
LAs 
implementing 
both 
LAMPS 
and CMPs. 
Once 
80% (32) 
of 
LAs 
have 
taken over 
the 
CDP 
component 
with 
their 
own 
staff, 
MASAF 
will 
maintain 
a 
single 
national 
office, and continue 
to 
support 
the 
remaining 
LAs, 
CBOs, 
and 
COMSICs 
with 
implementation. 
In 
the 
transition 
period, 
LAs 
will 
have 
the 
option 
of 
either 
using 
their 
own 
staff, 
or 
obtain 
assistance 
from 
MASAF 
ZO 
(Zones 
will 
initially 
be 
reduced 
from 
12 
to 
3 
with 
9 
Field 
Offices, and 
then 
abolished). 
As 
an 
exit 
strategy 
for 
the 
Bank, 
the 
project 
will 
leave 
behind 
a 
legal framework 
for 
the 
CDD 
approach 
based 
on 
MASAF, 
PMCs, 
COMSICs, and 
NGOs/CBOs 
working 
with 
LAs, 
communities, 
and

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
Benchmarks 
and 
targets 
relating 
to 
macro-economic 
reform, 
fiscal 
performance and social 
sector 
resource 
allocation 
are 
provided 
in 
the 
Government 
MTEF 
for 
implementing 
the 
MPRSP, and 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
As 
the proposed 
project 
focuses 
on 
poverty 
reduction, 
basic 
social and 
economic 
infrastructure and 
service 
delivery, 
it 
is 
considered 
part 
of 
the 
Bank’s core 
lending 
program 
in 
support 
of 
the 
MPRSP, 
especially 
pillar 
3 
on 
the 
provision 
of 
safety 
nets 
for 
the 
vulnerable. 
The project 
expects 
the 
Government 
of 
Malawi 
to 
(a) 
implement 
the 
decentralization 
plan 
matched 
by 
specified 
essential 
community 
service 
packages 
from 
the 
key 
sectors; 
and 
(b) 
follow 
through 
with 
the 
privatization 
of 
the 
Malawi 
Savings 
Bank 
which 
will 
support 
the 
emergence 
of 
a 
strong 
and 
sustainable 
framework 
for 
community 
savings 
in 
Malawi. 
The 
legal framework 
in 
place 
will 
be 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
the 
emergence 
of 
MASAF, 
PMCs, 
COMSICs 
and 
NGOs/CBOs 
as

approach. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target population: 
The project 
will 
strengthen the 
capacity 
of 
communities, 
community 
leadership, 
and 
CBOs 
to 
effectively 
implement activities 
that 
will 
address 
development 
needs. 
The 
main 
beneficiaries 
will 
be 
(a) 
poor 
communities 
with 
inadequate 
access 
to 
social 
services 
such 
as 
schools, 
clinics, 
water, 
and effective 
transport; 
(b) 
poor 
households 
experiencing 
food 
insecurity; 
(c) 
vulnerable 
individuals 
unable 
to 
organize 
interventions 
for 
themselves 
and needing 
the 
mediation 
of 
CBOs/NGOs; 
(d) 
communities, 
after 
participating 
in 
MASAF-funded 
activities, 
who 
are 
able 
to 
participate 
in 
group 
savings; 
and 
(e) 
implementing 
agencies 
such 
as 
PMCs, COMSICs, 
NGOsKBOs, 
micro-finance institutions, 
and 
LAs. 
This 
program 
is 
targeted 
to 
the 
nearly two-thirds 
of 
the 
population 
which 
is 
poor 
in 
Malawi 
and 
whose 
work 
will 
contribute 
to 
the achievement 
of 
12 
MDG 
targets 
for 
Malawi. 
Resource 
Allocation 
and 
Targeting: 
Utilizing 
the 
National 
Local 
Government Finance 
Committee’s 
guidelines 
for 
allocation 
of 
development 
funds, 
MASAF 
3 
will 
allocate 
funds 
to 
LAs 
based 
on 
50% 
for 
population 
and 
50% 
for 
poverty 
and 
service 
indicators. 
The 
indicators used relate 
to 
the 
12 
MDG 
targets 
being 
tracked 
in 
MASAF 
3 
as 
well 
as 
availability 
and 
reliability 
of 
data. 
The 
indicators 
utilized for 
fund 
allocation 
for 
the 
sub-components 
of 
the 
CDP 
and 
the 
SSP 
correlate 
to 
the 
activities 
supported under 
these 
components. 
The 
methodology 
and 
formula 
are 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
13 
and 
provide 
a 
first 
cut 
of 
District 
level 
three-year 
indicative planning 
figure 
(IPF) 
in 
line 
with 
the 
MTEF 
cycle. 
These 
IPFs 
will 
be 
revised annually 
for 
uncommitted 
MASAF 
resources. 
While 
for 
monitoring 
and 
planning 
purposes 
the 
allocation 
has 
been 
broken 
down 
by 
component, 
Districts 
will 
be 
given 
a 
single 
IPF which 
they 
will 
use 
to 
undertake 
MASAF 
3 
activities. 
These 
funds 
will 
be 
used 
by 
LAs 
in 
response 
to 
community 
demand-driven development 
with 
the 
social 
fund

principles (community 
participation, direct financing, 
transparency, 
accountability, 
partnership, 
capacity 
building, 
autonomy 
of 
implementers, 
flexibility, 
and apolitical) 
without 
adhering 
to 
the component 
allocations 
(but 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
monitor 
and report 
on 
resource 
use 
by 
components 
as 
a 
way 
of 
identifying 
those 
areas 
where 
community 
demands 
are 
greatest). 
The 
LAs 
will 
carry out 
open-ended 
PUS 
in 
those 
communities 
which 
have 
the 
furthest 
to 
go 
in 
attaining 
the 
12 
MDG 
targets 
being 
tracked 
under 
MASAF 
3; 
this 
will 
generate 
a 
list 
of 
community 
priorities 
to 
be 
integrated 
into District 
plans. 
If 
the 
priorities include 
activities 
that 
qualify 
for 
MASAF 
support, 
then 
extended 
PRAs 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Districts 
to 
identify 
sub-projects 
to 
be 
funded 
using 
MASAF 
resources. 
provide 
assistance 
to 
LAs 
from 
the 
open-ended 
PRA 
stage 
to completion 
of 
sub-projects. 
Details 
of 
the 
sub-project 
cycle 
are 
provided 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual. 
In 
Phase 
I 
of 
the 
APL, 
the 
IPF 
will 
be 
allocated 
to 
27 
Districts, consisting 
of 
40 
LAs 
(Districts, 
Towns 
and 
Municipalities). 
During 
this 
phase, 
efforts 
will 
be 
undertaken 
to 
collect 
and 
disaggregate data 
relating 
to 
the 
town 
and 
municipal 
assemblies 
so 
that 
during 
Phase 
I1 
of 
the 
APL, 
the 
IPF 
will 
be allocated 
to 
the 
40 
LAs. 
MASAF

Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
A 
MASAF 
MU 
reporting to 
a 
Board 
of 
Directors 
(with 
an 
Executive 
Director 
as 
Secretary) 
will 
continue 
to 
manage 
this 
project 
- 
the 
Board 
being 
responsible 
for 
overall 
policy 
and operational 
guidance. 
The 
MASAF 
Board 
will 
oversee 
professional 
staff 
selected 
in 
a 
transparent 
and competitive 
manner. 
MASAF 
will 
decentralize 
staff 
from 
ZOs 
to 
LA 
Planning 
Offices 
for 
those 
Authorities 
without 
the 
relevant 
staff 
(Program 
Officer 
and 
Technical 
Supervisor) 
to 
assist 
with 
building 
LA 
technical 
and 
management 
capacity 
to 
support communities. 
MASAF 
will 
enter 
into 
Memoranda 
of 
Understanding 
with 
all 
LAs 
to 
govern 
the 
role 
of 
LA 
Offices, 
their 
staffing, 
and 
operations; 
to 
be 
reviewed 
annually 
to 
take 
into 
account 
changes 
in 
activities. 
The 
MASAF 
Board 
will 
have 
two 
standing committees at 
the 
national 
level to 
review 
project 
requests 
and 
make 
recommendations 
(NTAC) 
and 
to 
oversee 
monitoring 
and 
accountability 
results 
(NACCEA). 
For 
HlV/AIDS 
activities 
to 
be 
supported 
in 
the 
SSP 
component, 
guidance 
on 
national 
norms 
will 
be 
sought 
from 
the 
National 
AIDS 
Commission; 
the 
appraisal 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
applications 
at the 
district 
will 
include 
representation 
from District 
AIDS 
Coordination 
Committees. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
recently 
established 
LAs, 
MASAF 
will 
work to 
address 
longer-term 
institutional and 
capacity 
concerns 
by 
facilitating 
the deepening 
of 
decentralization 
in 
the 
country 
by 
leaving 
the 
management 
of 
community 
projects 
to 
those 
LAs 
with 
demonstrated capacity. 
As 
a 
vehicle 
for 
the 
Government 
to 
meet service 
provision 
targets 
through 
the 
CDD 
approach, 
MASAF's 
work 
will 
be 
within 
a 
legal 
framework 
defined 
by 
LA 
by-laws and 
MASAF's 
legal 
status. 
LAs 
will 
receive 
limited 
support 
from 
MASAF 
to 
ensure 
that 
PRA 
processes 
are 
integrated 
into 
district planning 
so 
that 
community priorities 
are at 
the centre 
of 
district 
plans. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
community 
empowerment 
within 
decentralization, 
new 
operational and procurement 
manuals have 
incorporated 
improved 
operational 
procedures. 
All 
sub-projects 
funded 
by 
MASAF 
will 
follow 
specified 
sub-project 
cycles, 
with 
all 
implementers 
reporting 
their 
performance 
against agreed 
sub-project 
cycle 
benchmarks 
as 
specified 
in 
the Operational 
Manual. 
All 
CDP 
requests 
from 
communities 
will 
be 
appraised 
and approved 
by 
the 
LAs 
using 
its 
DEC, 
which 
will 
also 
receive 
resources 
for LAMPs. 
Funds 
for 
LAMPs 
will 
continue 
to 
flow 
into 
an 
account 
held 
by 
LAs 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
community 
assets 
through 
labor-intensive 
methods 
while 
transferring 
incomes 
to 
vulnerable able-bodied 
individuals. 
Technical 
support 
will 
be 
provided to 
address 
the 
lack 
of 
skills 
within 
LAs 
in 
specific 
areas 
of 
community 
service 
package 
provision. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
CMPs, 
funding 
will 
continue 
to 
flow 
to 
the 
community 
elected 
PMC. 
Those 
LAs 
who 
record 
successful 
implementation 
of 
LAMPs 
will 
take 
over 
the 
channeling 
of 
resources 
to 
PMCs. 
Once 
80% 
of 
LAs 
are 
successful 
in 
implementing 
the 
CDPs 
using 
pre-agreed benchmarks, 
MASAF 
will 
transform 
into 
a 
training 
and

capacity 
building 
institution 
to 
support 
LAs 
overcome 
periodic difficulties, 
promote 
measures 
for 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
at the 
community 
and 
district 
levels, 
and 
channel 
resources 
to CBOs 
and 
COMSICs. 
Under 
SSP, 
LA 
staff 
will 
facilitate 
the generation 
of 
community priorities to 
tackle 
vulnerability 
(orphans, 
elderly, 
disabled, 
chronically 
ill, 
malnourished, 
etc.). 
The 
appraisal 
and approval 
of 
SSP 
requests 
within 
the 
agreed 
ceiling 
will 
be 
done 
by 
the 
DEC, 
through 
District 
Technical 
Committees 
with 
NGO 
representation, 
as 
well 
as 
relevant 
sector 
ministries, 
and 
LA 
staff. 
Community 
Savings 
Groups 
and Clubs 
will 
be 
promoted 
by 
district-level 
staff 
and supported 
by 
MASAF 
with 
capacity 
building, 
training, and 
limited 
construction 
of 
community 
infrastructure, 
including 
purchase 
of 
safes. 
MASAF 
will 
promote community 
savings, 
work to 
address 
specific community-related 
constraints 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
relevant 
MFIs, 
and 
ensure 
that appropriate mechanisms 
are 
developed 
with 
MFIs 
for 
the 
poor to 
have 
reliable 
and 
sustainable 
access 
to 
micro-finance.  Members 
of 
Community 
Savings 
Groups 
will 
be 
able 
to 
borrow 
from 
the 
MFI 
holding 
their 
accounts 
(e.g. 
Malawi 
Savings Bank, 
existing 
MFI, 
etc.) 
for 
investing 
according 
to 
individual 
and 
group 
priorities 
within 
a 
framework 
of 
increasing household 
food, 
nutrition, 
and 
economic 
security 
to 
manage 
risk 
and 
reduce 
vulnerability. 
Appraisal 
will 
be 
undertaken 
as 
in 
SSP, 
but 
approval 
will 
be 
by 
the 
MASAF 
Board. 
LAs 
will 
approve 
sub-projects 
within 
the 
specified 
thresholds 
for 
the 
CDP 
component, 
and 
receive copies 
of 
all 
project 
requests 
by 
NGOs/CBOs 
under 
the 
SSP 
component. 
NTAC 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
endorsing approved 
LA 
sub-proj 
ects, 
approving 
all 
requests 
from 
NGOs/CBOs 
and 
approving 
sub-projects 
above 
the 
threshold 
set 
for 
LA 
approval. 
The 
NTAC 
will 
report to 
the 
MASAF 
Board 
and 
will 
meet 
monthly 
with 
the 
MASAF 
MU 
to 
review 
sub-project 
requests 
from 
LAs. 
After 
NTAC 
and 
Board 
meetings, 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
publish 
a 
list 
of 
all 
projects 
approved, 
their 
value, 
districts 
and 
PMC 
members 
for 
increased 
transparency. 
To 
increase 
accountability, 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
submit 
a 
quarterly 
progress 
report 
to 
the 
Board 
(copied 
to 
the 
NTAC), 
and 
a summary 
of 
the 
report 
will 
be 
published 
after 
the 
Board 
meeting 
(with 
performance 
details 
for 
each 
LA 
and 
CBO 
receiving 
funds 
from MASAF). 
Similarly, 
community-based 
monitoring 
reports 
will 
be 
reviewed 
by 
NACCEA 
before 
their 
submission 
to 
the 
Board 
and publication. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
The 
choice 
of 
alternatives 
was 
informed 
by 
the 
Government’s 
draft 
MPRSP 
and 
Bank’s response 
in 
the 
CAS, 
and 
the 
MDGs 
-whose 
attainment 
will 
help 
address 
the 
problem 
of 
deepening 
poverty 
in 
Malawi. 
The 
MPRSP 
recognized 
MASAF 
as 
“one 
of 
the 
key 
instruments that 
Government 
has 
put 
in 
place 
to 
promote community participation 
in 
national 
development and 
enhance 
and 
deepen 
the 
decentralization 
process“. 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
a 
follow-up 
operation 
to 
MASAF 
I 
and 
I1 
which 
were 
implemented 
during 
the 
period 
1996-2003. 
In 
recognition 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
social 
fund 
approach 
in 
responding 
to 
community-owned 
development, 
both 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
the 
Decentralization 
Policy 
Framework 
have 
recognized the 
centrality 
of 
the 
CDD 
approach 
in 
alleviating 
poverty. 
Like 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
the 
new 
project 
will 
emphasize 
community 
participation, especially 
by 
vulnerable 
groups, 
in 
the 
design 
of 
development 
activities 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
re-enforcing 
community 
livelihood 
systems. 
MASAF 
will 
continue 
to 
foster 
the 
development 
of 
community 
leadership, 
accountability and 
local 
governance 
as 
cornerstones 
of 
a 
process 
aimed 
at 
ensuring 
that 
poor 
communities 
can 
articulate 
their 
specific 
needs, 
prioritize 
them, 
demand 
quality 
services, 
and 
manage 
the 
processes 
and 
the 
outcomes. 
The 
main 
difference 
will 
be 
that instead 
of 
communities dealing 
directly 
with 
MASAF 
structures, 
they 
will 
plan 
and 
implement 
activities 
in 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs/CBOs 
and 
the 
new 
LAs, 
with 
MASAF 
-13- 
Page  18
playing 
a 
facilitating 
role. 
The option 
of 
closing 
down 
MASAF 
and 
channeling 
funds 
to 
LAs 
was 
considered 
and rejected 
because 
the 
newly 
established 
LAs 
need 
time 
to 
build 
capacity 
for 
the 
effective 
integration 
of 
community 
empowerment 
strategies 
into 
decentralized development.  Furthermore, 
the 
option 
of 
placing 
extra 
staff 
in 
LAs 
was 
rejected 
because 
the 
Department 
of 
Local 
Government 
preferred 
that 
each 
LA 
be 
left 
to 
find 
the 
necessary personnel. 
It 
is 
for 
these 
reasons 
that 
capacity 
building 
efforts 
will 
be 
targeted at 
both 
the 
LAs 
and central 
government 
departments 
at 
the 
District level while 
the 
decentralization 
program 
is 
implemented. 
Sector 
Issue 
Instead 
of 
making 
grants 
available 
for 
income 
generating projects, the 
design 
team 
of 
MASAF 
3-CEDP 
has 
included 
a 
Community 
Savings 
and 
Investment 
Promotion 
component, 
which 
will 
allow 
individuals 
to 
save 
and 
borrow from 
an 
MFI. 
Through 
a 
well-developed 
information, 
education 
and 
communication 
(IEC) 
system, 
MASAF will 
ensure 
that 
communities 
are 
able 
to 
identify 
possible opportunities 
that 
will 
promote 
increased economic development 
at 
the 
household 
level 
while 
ensuring accountability 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
public 
services 
by 
LAs. 
Communities 
will 
then 
gain 
increased 
access 
to 
economic 
development 
opportunities that 
are 
appropriate 
and 
responsive 
to 
their 
needs. 
The 
option 
of 
channeling 
IDA 
resources 
into 
MFIs 
for 
lending 
to individuals 
and 
groups 
was 
considered 
and rejected 
because 
experience 
from 
Malawi 
and 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
world 
shows 
that 
this 
is 
not 
a sustainable 
way 
of 
providing 
credit 
to 
the 
poor; and 
it 
is 
better 
to 
use grants 
for 
capacity 
building 
and supporting 
the 
vulnerable 
poor, 
and 
let 
MFIs 
lend 
money 
collected 
from 
savers. 
Project 
Government 
and 
various 
representatives 
of 
stakeholder 
institutions 
expressed 
concern 
over 
the 
state 
of 
poor 
housing 
in 
the 
country (both 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas), 
and 
the 
desire 
to 
assist 
poor 
households 
improve their 
dwellings. 
Due 
to 
the 
difficulties 
of 
targeting 
housing 
support 
to 
poor 
families, 
the 
inclusion 
of 
housing 
in 
the 
CDP 
component 
was 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
channeling 
limited 
support 
to 
vulnerable 
groups 
through 
NGOs/CBOs 
to 
improve 
incomes 
and household 
food 
security 
under 
the 
SSP 
component. 
MASAF 
will 
instead 
collaborate 
with 
national-level 
institutions 
and 
LAs 
to 
ensure 
that 
an 
enabling environment 
is 
created 
for 
households 
to improve their 
incomes 
and 
assets 
through 
savings 
and 
investments. 
The 
option 
of 
having 
a 
self-standing 
community 
lands component 
was 
rejected 
because 
MASAF 
would 
have 
decided 
"a 
priori" 
what 
communities 
would 
consider 
a 
priority 
need 
and 
this 
flies 
in 
the 
face 
of 
demand-driven development 
and 
undermines 
MASAF's 
principles. 
It 
was 
also 
difficult to 
reach 
consensus 
on 
a transparent 
targeting mechanism 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
land 
among 
the poor. 
The 
same 
difficulties 
arose 
over 
the 
distribution 
of 
agricultural 
inputs 
and 
it 
was 
decided 
that 
such 
support 
should 
be 
left to 
the 
market 
for 
individuals 
participating 
in 
savings groups. 
The 
integration 
of 
community 
agriculture and 
land 
development 
support 
into 
MASAF will

During 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
communities 
requested 
funding 
for 
income 
generating 
projects 
during 
periods 
of 
need, 
and, 
except 
in 
the 
component 
supporting 
the 
vulnerable, 
these 
have been 
ineligible 
for 
funding. 
Experience 
shows 
that a 
certain 
level 
of 
social 
capital 
and capacity 
are 
needed 
before 
effective 
economic 
capital 
from 
community 
investment 
projects can 
be 
realized. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason that the 
COMSIP 
component 
has 
been 
introduced to 
build 
on 
experiences 
from 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11. 
Although 
MASAF 
I1 
funds 
were 
fully 
committed 
by 
the 
Mid-Term 
Review 
(February 
2002), 
there 
is 
continuing and overwhelming 
demand 
by 
communities 
for 
resources 
to 
finance 
community 
sub-projects 
such 
as 
school 
classrooms 
and 
teachers' 
houses, 
health 
facilities, 
rural 
water 
supply, 
and 
community 
roads. 
There 
is 
still 
a 
large un-met 
demand 
for 
classrooms 
to 
cope 
with 
the increased 
enrollment 
resulting 
from 
the 
Free 
Primary 
Education 
policy 
implemented after 
1995. 
Failure 
to 
adequately 
respond 
to 
this 
demand 
will 
result 
in 
the 
regression 
of 
existing 
community 
capacity 
and social capital. 
MASAF 
3 
will 
therefore 
continue 
to 
finance 
community 
investments 
so 
that under-served 
communities 
which 
did 
- 
15- 
Page  20
not 
receive support 
under 
MASAF 
I 
and 
I1 
can 
also 
be 
reached, 
while 
building 
economic 
capital 
as 
the 
second 
stage 
of 
helping 
poor 
communities tackle poverty. 
Under 
MASAF 
3, 
the 
role 
of 
PMCs, 
COMSICs, and 
NGOs/CBOs 
will 
be 
institutionalized 
as 
a 
foundation 
for 
the 
CDD 
approach 
in 
Malawi. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
and 
recipient 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
The 
Government, 
through 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
President and Cabinet 
(OPC), has 
taken 
the 
initiative 
and 
full 
ownership 
of 
project 
preparation 
by 
establishing 
a 
Project 
Preparation 
Team 
drawn 
from 
the 
OPC, 
Ministry 
of 
Gender and 
Community 
Services, 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and 
Economic 
Planning, 
National 
Economic 
Council, 
Ministry 
of 
Justice, 
Department 
of 
Local 
Government, 
and 
MASAF. 
This 
followed 
a 
letter 
of 
request 
sent 
by 
the 
President 
of 
Malawi 
to 
the President 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
seeking 
support 
for 
MASAF 
3 
given 
the 
very 
high 
level 
of 
demand exceeding 
available 
resources. 
Extensive 
consultations 
were 
held 
with 
stakeholders 
in 
districts, communities,  and 
nationally 
with 
NGOs, 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
with 
various development partners. 
A 
draft program 
concept paper 
was 
prepared 
that 
provided 
background 
information 
and 
project 
rationale 
for 
the 
Government’s 
request, 
followed 
by 
the 
preparation 
of 
an Operational 
Manual 
backed 
by 
a 
number 
of 
handbooks 
to 
guide 
implementation. 
Logical 
links 
have 
emerged 
between 
MASAF 
3, 
the 
MPRSP, 
and 
the 
decentralization framework. 
The 
four pillars 
of 
MPRSP 
and 
the 
four 
objectives 
defining 
the 
decentralization 
framework 
are 
closely 
related 
to 
the operations 
of 
MASAF 
in 
promoting 
grassroots 
community-owned 
development 
aimed 
at 
overcoming 
poverty. 
Among 
senior government 
officials 
and 
political 
leadership, 
there 
is 
a 
growing 
awareness 
of 
the 
role 
MASAF 
can 
play 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
both 
policy 
frameworks 
- 
decentralization and 
the 
MPRSP 
- 
so 
that 
Malawi 
can 
use 
the 
CDD 
approach 
to 
meet 
its 
targets 
set 
for 
the 
MDGs. 
The 
MASAF 
3 
APL 
has 
been 
firmly 
grounded 
in 
the 
MTEF 
to 
implement 
the 
MPRSP. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
Under 
the 
Comprehensive 
Development Framework, 
the 
Bank’s 
strategy 
is 
to 
focus 
on 
activities 
in 
which 
it 
has 
a comparative 
advantage 
over 
other donors 
while 
supporting 
the 
PRSPs 
and other 
strategies 
aimed 
at assisting countries 
meet 
the 
MDGs. 
In 
the 
partnership 
matrix 
for 
the 
country, 
the 
Bank 
has 
significantly placed 
its 
focus 
on 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
income 
of 
the 
poor 
under 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
macro-economic 
stability. 
The 
Bank 
has 
experience 
in 
working 
successfully 
with 
social 
funds 
in 
Malawi 
and 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
world. 
In 
developing 
this 
project, 
the 
Government 
has 
taken 
into 
consideration documentation 
published 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
experiences 
from 
projects 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank, 
bilateral 
donors, 
and 
NGOs. 
The 
use 
of 
Bank-developed 
Risk 
and 
Vulnerability 
Assessment 
tools 
in 
Malawi 
is 
going 
to 
contribute 
to 
a 
broader 
and 
more 
relevant 
sub-project 
menu 
for 
community 
implementation 
within 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
CAS 
framework. 
A 
social 
fund’s 
multi-sectoral nature 
raises 
cross-cutting 
issues 
requiring 
technical 
expertise 
in 
various 
sectors. 
MASAF 
is 
complementary 
to 
the 
Local 
Government 
reform 
as 
it 
promotes a 
bottom-up 
demand 
driven 
approach 
to 
development, 
and 
facilitates capacity 
building 
for 
districts 
to 
implement 
demand-driven 
programs, 
and 
complements the 
supply 
side 
stimulated 
by 
Local 
Government 
reforms. 
The 
Bank’s technical 
expertise 
in 
general, 
its 
global 
knowledge 
base, 
as 
well 
as 
past 
IDA-financed 
operations 
in 
education, 
health, 
roads, 
water and sanitation 
sectors, 
put 
the 
Bank 
in 
a 
unique 
position 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
address 
these cross-sectoral issues 
within 
a 
framework 
of 
decentralization. 
MASAF 
fits 
into 
the 
Bank 
Country 
Team’s 
new 
strategy 
of 
strengthening 
multi-sectoral 
operations 
in 
social 
adjustment, 
capacity 
building, 
infrastructure, and 
the 
CDD 
approach 
as 
a 
way 
of 
achieving 
the 
MDGs 
in 
Malawi. 
The 
experience 
of 
MASAF 
I, 
I1 
and 
now 
3 
is 
expected 
to influence 
the 
design 
of 
future 
operations 
in 
health, education, 
and 
other service 
sectors 
so 
that 
communities and 
LAs 
can 
remain 
at the 
center 
of 
service 
delivery; 
these 
will 
support a re-alignment 
of 
sector 
ministries 
with 
LAs 
and

community 
structures.

Economic Analysis, 
including 
least 
cost 
options 
As 
MASAF 
complements sectoral 
interventions 
in 
the 
improvement 
of 
service 
delivery, 
patterns 
of 
sectoral 
recurrent 
and 
capital 
expenditures 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration, 
particularly 
in 
the social 
sectors. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
strong linkage between 
MASAF 
and 
the 
Financial 
Management, 
Transparency 
and 
Accountability 
Project 
(FIMTAP) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
MTEF 
to 
ensure 
that communities and their 
organizations 
are 
participants 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
improved 
governance 
and 
use 
of 
resources 
at 
district 
and 
national 
levels. 
There 
is 
evidence that 
communities can 
construct 
assets 
that 
are 
cost-effective 
compared 
with 
costs 
incurred 
under 
private 
sector 
construction, 
with 
the 
added 
benefit 
of 
local 
ownership 
which 
protects the 
assets 
from 
vandalism and 
deterioration. 
A 
resource 
allocatiodtargeting 
formula 
was 
developed 
following 
the 
National 
Local 
Government Finance 
Committee’s  guidelines 
for 
development 
funds. 
MASAF 
3’s 
allocation formula 
comprises 
50% 
population 
and 
50% 
poverty 
indicators 
relating 
to 
the 
12 
MDGs 
being 
tracked 
by 
MASAF 
3; 
this 
reinforces the 
poverty reduction 
and 
targeting objectives 
of 
the 
project. 
NPV=US$

ERR

Annex

Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
budgetary 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
has 
been 
taken 
into 
account, 
especially 
the 
recurrent 
cost 
implications 
of 
the 
demand 
driven 
social 
sector 
investments 
and 
their potential 
for 
negative 
fiscal 
effects. 
Similarly, 
the 
financial 
analysis 
has 
taken 
into 
account the 
resources generated 
and 
savings created 
through 
community participation. 
Useful 
lessons have 
been 
gained 
from 
a 
detailed 
review 
of 
MASAF 
I 
in 
the 
way 
sectors 
were 
able 
to 
respond 
to community efforts 
in 
providing 
necessary 
social 
infrastructure. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
Recurrent 
expenses, taxes, 
and 
revenue 
from 
both 
SSP 
and 
COMSIP 
will 
be 
covered. 
3. 
Technical: 
The major 
technical 
issues 
are: 
(i) 
poverty 
analysis 
and 
(self-) 
targeting; 
(ii) 
absorptive 
capacity 
at 
district, 
ward, 
and community 
levels 
(which 
raises 
the 
issue 
of 
availability 
of 
district-level 
skills 
for 
facilitation, implementation, 
and 
supervision 
in 
the 
short-run); 
(iii) 
transparency, 
accountability 
and 
district financial 
management; 
and 
(iv) 
continuous 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
(including 
the 
establishment 
of 
baseline 
data) 
by 
MASAF 
and 
partner 
national 
institutions. 
This 
approach 
fits 
within 
the 
strategies 
outlined 
in 
the 
MPRSP to 
address 
rising 
poverty 
in 
the 
country. 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
current 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
continue 
to 
operate 
at 
the 
national 
level 
and 
be 
responsible 
for 
executing 
the 
project 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
government, 
represented 
by 
the 
OPC. 
It 
will 
be 
autonomous 
(answerable 
to 
Parliament), 
and 
staffed 
with 
skilled 
personnel 
with 
specific responsibilities. 
At 
the 
Zone 
level, 
qualified 
- 
17- 
Page  22
personnel 
will 
be 
introduced 
to 
strengthen 
LA 
financial 
management 
and technical 
services. 
The 
Board 
will 
oversee 
policy 
issues 
and 
operational guidelines, supported 
by 
NTAC 
to provide 
technical 
guidance 
to 
MASAF 
MU, 
and 
NACCEA 
to 
promote accountability. 
The 
LAs 
will 
take 
over 
district-level 
management, 
with 
PMCs retaining 
their 
central 
role 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
community 
sub-projects. 
Community 
Savings 
Clubs 
will 
relate 
to 
an 
appropriate 
MFI 
with 
its 
own 
Board, 
although 
there 
will 
be 
consultations between 
the 
MFI 
and 
MASAF 
Boards 
to 
achieve 
synergy 
in 
their 
development 
strategies 
for 
sustainable 
household 
food, and economic security. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
manage 
the 
project 
on behalf 
of 
the 
govemment 
with 
support 
from 
LAs, 
community 
facilitators, and NGOs/CBOs. 
LAs 
will 
be 
strengthened 
with 
technical 
staff 
who 
will 
work 
with 
a 
District 
Engineer 
to 
address 
problems 
of 
quality 
and 
cost-effectiveness. 
As 
part 
of 
project 
preparation 
activities, 
studies have 
been undertaken 
to 
strengthen 
development 
communication, 
MIS, 
financial 
management, 
and 
procurement. 
A 
KISS 
that 
facilitates 
the 
interface between 
MIS, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
and 
development 
communication initiatives 
will 
make 
information 
available 
within 
and 
outside 
MASAF 
to 
enhance 
the 
quality 
of 
operations. 
LAs, 
CBOs/NGOs, 
PMCs, and 
COMSICs 
will 
manage 
their 
relevant 
sub-projects 
using 
the 
OM 
and various 
handbooks. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Experience under 
MASAF 
I 
and 
MASAF 
I1 
with 
respect 
to 
procurement 
has 
been 
positive. 
Prior 
to 
procurement 
being 
undertaken 
at 
community 
level, participants receive training, 
including 
procurement 
training. 
PMCs 
report back 
to 
their 
communities 
on 
activities 
undertaken, 
and 
have 
been 
able 
to 
justify 
their 
expenditures and receive 
funding 
to 
complete 
their 
activities. 
Staff 
at 
MU 
who 
are 
responsible 
for 
procurement have received 
training 
and 
will 
receive 
hrther 
training 
in 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures 
as 
necessary 
to 
perform 
their 
duties. 
MASAF 
3 
will 
follow 
the procedures 
used 
under 
MASAF 
I 
and 
MASAF 
I1 
for 
procurement, 
with 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
Credit 
supporting 
community 
level 
activities. 
For 
CMPs, procurement 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
PMCs; 
for 
LAMPS, 
procurement 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
LAs. 
Procurement 
under 
the 
SSP 
component 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Project Implementing Agency 
(NGOs/CBOs), 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
elected 
Project 
Support Committee, and 
activities 
supported 
under 
COMSIP 
will 
be 
procured 
by 
PMCs. 
Procurement 
of 
consultants, 
as 
well 
as 
vehicles, 
office 
equipment, 
and 
supplies 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
MASAF 
MU.

5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
Major: 
Poor 
communities 
in 
Malawi 
have 
already 
shown an 
improved 
perception 
of 
environmental 
degradation 
when 
constructing infrastructure 
such 
as 
school 
buildings, 
health 
centers 
and other 
sub-projects 
eligible 
under 
MASAF 
11. 
Environmental 
screening, 
reviews 
and 
the 
assessment 
of 
potential 
environmental impacts 
on 
investments have 
been an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
design, 
implementation, 
supervision 
and 
monitoring 
during 
MASAF 
11, 
and 
MASAF 
3 
will 
continue 
this 
practice and 
improve 
on 
it 
by 
working 
with 
LAs 
in 
environmental 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
to 
ensure 
awareness, 
enforcement 
and 
monitoring 
of 
environmental 
standards 
and guidelines 
as 
well 
as 
promoting 
sub-projects 
aimed 
at 
improving 
communities’ 
management 
of 
their 
natural 
resources.  Trees 
are 
of 
particular 
importance 
to 
communities 
as 
resources 
for 
construction, 
fuel, 
and 
for 
soil 
and 
water conservation; 
and 
all 
MASAF 
supported sub-projects 
will 
have 
a 
tree-planting 
element. 
The 
District 
Development 
Planning 
Framework, 
MASAF 
3 
Operational Manual, and various 
handbooks 
will 
guide 
the 
integration 
of 
environmental 
issues 
into 
all 
community 
sub-projects 
so 
that 
community 
environmental 
protection

becomes 
institutionalized. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The majority 
of 
demand-driven 
and 
community-oriented 
sub-projects 
will 
remain 
comparatively small 
in 
size, 
and 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
these 
sub-projects 
will 
be 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
with 
resulting 
negligible

How 
have 
stakeholders 
been consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts and proposed environment 
management 
plan?  Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation that 
were 
used 
and 
which 
groups were consulted? 
A 
workshop 
was 
held 
in 
Malawi with 
District 
Environmental 
Officers, 
District 
Planning 
Officers, 
the 
national 
level 
department 
dealing 
with 
the environment, 
and 
MASAF 
staff, 
facilitated 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
environment 
specialist 
on 
the 
team. 
The 
result 
was 
procedures and 
guidelines 
for 
environmental 
screening at 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
sub-project 
cycle 
for 
activities 
to 
be 
funded 
by 
MASAF. 
It 
is 
the 
community 
groups 
who 
propose a sub-project, 
and 
the 
local 
community 
discusses 
it 
openly 
in 
meetings 
locally. 
When 
the sub-project 
is 
appraised, 
it 
is 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
members 
of 
the community, 
and 
results 
are 
communicated 
back 
to 
the 
PMC 
which 
is 
elected 
by 
and 
from 
the 
local 
community. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
new 
guidance 
note 
on 
CDD 
projects and 
safeguards, 
MASAF 
3 
has 
mainstreamed 
the 
safeguard 
screening 
into 
the 
Operational 
Manual 
and 
the 
sub-project 
cycle 
of 
each 
project 
component. 
This 
means 
- 
19- 
Page  24
that 
each 
subproject 
will 
be 
screened 
for 
possible 
violations 
of 
safeguards 
as 
well 
as 
its 
community 
involvement and 
ownership, 
its 
technical and 
financial 
feasibility, 
and 
its 
priority 
by 
the 
community 
as 
a 
whole. 
This 
appraisal 
will 
be 
done 
by 
district officers 
together 
with 
MASAF 
staff. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have 
been 
established 
to monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives and results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
MASAF 
3 
will 
have a 
MIS 
which 
will 
track 
the 
process 
of 
approval and 
rejection 
of 
applications. 
In 
MASAF 
II 
the 
tracking 
of 
the 
environmental, 
social 
and 
other 
assessment 
of 
the 
subproject 
prior 
to 
approval 
has 
been 
done 
manually, 
but 
will 
be 
improved 
with 
the 
new 
computerized 
district-level 
MIS 
system. 
6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
Key 
social 
issues: 
At 
the 
community 
level, 
while 
there 
is 
a clear 
sense 
of 
ownership, 
it 
has 
been 
inadequate 
in 
certain 
areas, 
particularly 
for 
road 
projects 
built 
through 
Districts. 
Communities 
have 
not 
been keen 
to 
maintain 
the roads 
without 
wage payments 
- 
a 
design 
and 
communication 
problem 
because 
sustainability 
has 
been 
difficult 
given 
that 
communities 
in 
the targeted 
Extension Planning 
Areas 
(EPAs) 
are 
so 
poor 
that they 
cannot 
spare 
time 
on 
unpaid 
work 
and 
would 
rather 
look 
for 
wage employment. 
This 
challenge remains 
and 
will 
be 
addressed 
by 
LAs, 
with 
support 
from MASAF. 
The training 
received 
by 
communities, 
especially 
the 
PMCs, 
has 
improved their 
ability to 
(a) 
manage 
risk 
at 
household 
level, 
(b) 
manage 
their 
own 
finances 
better, 
and 
(c) 
plan 
their 
own 
household 
activities 
better. 
For 
orphans 
and 
the 
single 
headed households 
who 
have 
acquired 
skills, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
economic 
well-being. 
Thus, 
the 
second 
major 
challenge 
is 
to 
consolidate 
the 
impact 
of 
MASAF 
on 
the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable, 
who 
have 
acquired 
a heightened 
sense 
of 
their 
ability to 
tackle 
poverty 
- 
"let 
us 
do 
a 
MASAF" 
has 
become a 
phrase 
used 
when 
the 
poor 
want 
to 
pool 
resources 
and 
undertake 
self-help 
projects 
on 
their 
own. 
The 
substantial 
social 
capital 
built 
under 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
followed 
by 
some 
limited 
economic 
capital, 
not only 
needs 
to 
be 
consolidated, 
but 
the 
the 
transformation 
process needs 
expansion 
and 
institutionalization. 
Under 
the 
Public Works 
Program 
of 
MASAF 
11, 
targeting 
of 
geographical 
areas 
within 
districts 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Vulnerability 
Assessment 
Mapping 
(VAM) 
results 
produced 
by 
the 
Famine and 
Early 
Warning 
Systems, 
using 
food 
production 
data 
from 
EPAs. 
The 
use 
of 
VAM 
has 
been challenged 
because 
it 
is 
not 
reliable 
and 
does 
not reflect 
the 
real food 
security 
situation. 
MASAF 
experience 
has 
been 
that 
the 
use 
of 
VAM 
results 
has 
not 
always 
led 
to 
the 
neediest 
areas 
being 
targeted. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Program 
uses 
a 
wage 
below 
the 
minimum 
wage 
rate 
to 
promote 
self-targeting 
so 
that 
only 
the 
very 
poor 
individuals 
participate.  Throughout the 
implementation 
period, beneficiaries perceived 
this 
wage 
rate 
to 
be 
too 
low 
- 
leading 
to 
low 
morale 
of 
the 
labor 
force, 
low 
productivity 
and 
poor 
quality 
of 
assets 
in 
some 
cases. 
The 
challenge remains 
of 
setting 
a 
wage 
which 
does 
not 
attract 
people 
away 
from 
economic activities 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
offering 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
remuneration 
to 
tackle poverty. 
The 
introduction 
of 
COMSICs 
is 
one 
way 
of 
responding 
by 
increasing 
the 
wage, 
but 
depositing 
the 
additional 
pay 
into 
a 
savings account, 
as 
has 
been 
done 
by 
several 
NGOs 
in 
Malawi 
and 
in 
other 
countries. 
Gender 
issues 
will 
continue 
to 
receive 
special 
attention and 
a 
gender 
plan 
of 
action 
with 
indicators 
will 
be 
prepared, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Gender 
and 
Community 
Services. 
The 
gender 
plan 
will 
identify 
means 
through 
which 
the 
impact 
of 
project activities 
on 
women 
and 
the 
children 
can 
be 
enhanced 
to 
promote 
a gender-sensitive 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system. 
It 
will 
also 
fit 
within 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
MDG 
targets 
for 
Malawi.

Stakeholders: 
The 
successes 
of 
MASAF 
I 
and 
I1 
was 
due 
to 
the partnership 
which 
emerged 
between 
PMCs, 
traditional 
leadership, 
the 
private 
sector, 
officials 
of 
Government 
working 
at the 
District 
level, 
and NGOs/CBOs 
working 
with 
vulnerable 
individuals. 
This 
partnership 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
(a) 
the 
involvement 
of 
new 
LA 
structures 
in 
all 
MASAF 
planning 
activities 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
CDP, 
(b) 
greater 
mobilization 
of 
more 
NGOdCBOs within 
the 
SSP 
component 
with 
strategic 
linkages 
between 
NGOs/CBOs 
and 
LAs, 
and 
(c) 
increased 
involvement 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
as 
COMSICs 
become 
active 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
income-generating 
activities. 
A 
partnership 
between 
sector 
ministries 
and 
agencies 
working 
with 
communities 
at 
the 
district 
level 
will 
be 
fostered 
to 
ensure 
sustainability, 
especially 
in 
the 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
assets 
created 
under 
the 
CDP 
component. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
Within 
the 
Local 
Government 
Planning 
Framework, 
PRA 
tools 
will 
be used 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
community 
development 
needs, 
with 
an 
extended 
PRA 
used 
to 
help 
communities 
develop 
an 
appropriate sub-project 
proposal 
for 
funding 
using 
MASAF 
resources 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
The 
vulnerable 
will 
receive support 
from 
MASAF 
3 
through 
NGOs/CBOs, 
who 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
preparation 
of 
the 
application, 
implementation 
of 
the 
activitiy, 
and operation 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
asset 
created. 
A 
Project 
Support Group, elected 
by 
the 
community, 
will 
act 
as 
a 
liaison 
between 
the 
community and 
the 
Project 
Implementing 
Agency 
(e.g., 
NGOICBO). 
The 
SSP 
component 
will 
also 
provide 
capacity 
building 
to 
NGOsKBOs, 
as 
well 
as 
community 
service 
organizations 
to improve 
their 
long-term 
sustainability. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
PRAs 
will 
receive 
NGO 
inputs 
as 
a 
number 
of 
NGOs 
have 
extensive 
experience 
with 
the 
tools and 
their 
use 
in 
local-level 
planning. 
The 
SSP 
component 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
implemented through 
NGOs/CBOs, 
while 
the 
new COMSIP 
component 
will 
strengthen 
NGOs/CBOs 
active 
in 
the 
micro-finance 
area. 
The monitoring 
of 
project 
achievements 
will 
be 
undertaken 
nationally 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF) 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
MTEF 
targets; 
and 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Economic Planning 
and 
Development 
in 
the 
context 
of 
progress made 
towards the 
achievement 
of 
MDG 
targets 
for 
Malawi. 
6.5 
How will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The existing 
MIS 
will 
be 
strengthened 
and 
extended 
to 
the 
District-level;  and 
appropriate 
linkages 
will 
be 
developed 
between 
MASAF 
and 
the 
proposed 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system 
system 
for 
the 
MPRSP 
at 
community, district, 
and 
national 
levels. 
The 
MIS 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system 
will 
enable 
MASAF 
to 
regularly obtain 
information 
from 
LAs 
and 
CBOsINGOs 
on 
implementation 
progress, 
and 
analysis 
will 
be 
made 
available 
to 
MOF, 
Department 
of 
Economic Planning 
and 
Development, 
Parliament, 
sector 
ministries, 
and 
the 
general 
public. 
IDA 
will 
continue 
to 
receive 
quarterly 
progress 
reports 
from MASAF, 
with 
an 
annual 
report 
on 
achievements.

have 
both 
familiarized 
themselves 
with 
the

The 
existing internal 
environmental 
assessment 
procedures 
are 
such that 
potential 
environmental and social problems 
will 
be identified 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
in 
the sub-project 
cycle, 
and the 
sub-project 
then 
redesigned 
or 
rejected. 
During 
field

Sustainability and

1. 
Sustainability: 
Empirical 
evidence 
from 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
and 
similar 
operations 
in 
several 
other regions, 
point 
to 
a 
positive correlation 
between 
community participation 
and 
the 
sustainability 
of 
sub-projects. 
Sustainability 
is 
tied 
to 
the 
complementary 
roles 
that other 
projects 
like 
FIMTAP 
will 
play. 
Macro-economic 
stability 
and 
the 
MPRSP 
place 
greater 
importance 
on 
the Government’s 
role 
in 
supporting 
basic 
social and economic 
services.  Systems 
and procedures have been 
revised 
in 
the 
Operational Manual, and 
training 
of 
project 
and 
key 
LA 
staff 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
to 
enhance 
project 
effectiveness. 
This 
will 
ensure 
that sub-projects 
with 
a 
low 
probability 
of 
sustainability 
are 
not 
undertaken. 
The 
COMSIP 
and 
TAP 
components 
have 
a 
particular 
focus 
on 
increased 
sustainability 
for 
project 
interventions and 
outcomes. 
MASAF 
3 
is 
designed 
based 
on 
the 
convergence 
between 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
communities and 
that 
of 
the government. 
Ensure 
adherence 
by 
Department 
of 
Local 
Government and 
National 
Local 
Government 
Finance 
Committee 
to 
the

2: 
Detailed Project Description 
MALAWI: 
Third Social Action Fund 
In 
April 
2002, 
Government 
adopted 
the 
MPRS, 
whose 
overall goal 
is 
to achieve sustainable 
poverty 
reduction through 
social, 
economic 
and political 
empowerment 
of 
the 
poor, 
as 
an overarching 
development 
framework, 
which 
is 
now 
the 
basis 
for 
all 
future Government 
development 
activities 
and 
provides 
the 
guiding 
framework 
for 
development 
assistance 
to 
the 
country. 
The 
MPRS 
also recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
cross-cutting 
issues 
of 
HIVIAIDS, 
gender, 
environment 
and 
technology 
and 
how 
these 
impact 
on 
poverty. 
The 
strategy focuses 
on 
the 
poor 
as 
influencing 
their 
own 
development, 
with 
Government and 
the 
development partners’ 
role 
being 
that 
of 
creating 
an 
enabling environment 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
poverty. 
The 
MPRS 
has 
the 
following 
four pillars: 
(a) 
Sustainable 
pro-poor 
economic 
growth 
- 
economically empowering 
the 
poor 
by 
ensuring 
access 
to 
credit 
and 
markets, 
skills 
development and 
employment 
generation; 
(b) 
Human 
capital 
development 
- 
ensuring 
the 
poor 
have the 
health 
status 
and education 
to 
lift 
themselves 
out 
of 
poverty; 
(c) 
Improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
the most 
vulnerable 
- 
providing 
sustainable 
safety 
nets 
for 
those 
who 
are 
unable 
to benefit 
from 
the 
first 
two 
pillars; 
(d) 
Good 
governance, 
political 
will 
and 
mindset 
- 
ensuring 
that the 
public 
and 
civil 
society 
institutions 
and 
systems 
protect 
and 
benefit 
the 
poor. 
The 
underlying 
principle 
of 
MPRSP 
is 
people’s empowerment 
so 
that 
sustainable 
development can 
come 
from 
people 
taking 
an 
active 
role 
in 
the 
management 
of 
their 
developmental 
initiatives. 
In 
its 
poverty 
reduction 
program, Government 
is 
faced 
by 
the 
challenges 
of 
mobilizing 
internal 
and external 
resources 
for 
development; 
prioritizing 
developments at 
both 
national 
and 
community 
levels 
for 
optimum 
allocation 
of 
resources; 
providing 
social 
protection 
to 
the 
vulnerable 
groups 
in 
society; 
and 
building 
human 
capacity 
at 
the 
national, 
district, 
and 
community 
level 
to 
address 
constraints 
to 
development. 
These challenges 
affect 
all 
the 
sectors 
with 
a 
responsibility 
for 
service 
delivery 
as 
well 
as 
those 
stimulating 
economic development 
and 
are 
complicated 
by 
the 
increasing levels 
of 
HJY/AIDS 
infections 
and 
the 
attendant costs 
of 
looking 
after 
both 
the 
infected 
and affected. 
This 
is 
at a 
time 
of 
declining 
economic performance 
by 
many 
of 
Malawi’s 
trading 
partners 
in 
Southern 
Africa 
as 
well 
as 
poor 
international 
prices 
for 
agricultural 
commodities.

hence 
MASAF 
3’s 
emphasis 
on 
mobilizing 
poor 
communities 
for 
increased economic 
production 
and 
not 
just 
for 
building 
public 
infrastructure. 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
build 
on 
the 
experiences 
of 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
with 
its 
focus 
on 
community 
empowerment and 
emphasis 
on 
participatory 
development 
processes, 
and 
use 
MASAF 
as 
an 
instrument 
for 
realizing 
the 
objectives 
of 
community 
empowerment 
and 
decentralized development 
management. 
In 
its 
design, 
the 
MASAF 
embodies 
principles 
of 
CDD 
in 
which 
(i) 
community 
empowerment; 
(ii) 
empowering 
local 
governments; 
(iii) 
re-aligning 
the 
center; 
(iv) 
improving 
accountability; and 
(v) 
building 
capacity 
are 
the 
major 
tenets. 
MASAF 
is 
therefore 
better 
placed 
to 
aid 
the 
effective realization 
of 
these 
objectives 
while 
supporting 
local 
governments 
to 
be 
responsive 
and 
accountable 
in 
public 
service 
delivery. 
Through 
a deliberate 
and 
comprehensive 
capacity 
enhancement 
program, 
MASAF 
will 
continue 
to 
-

Page  33
support 
the 
communities, 
LAs 
and national 
level 
sectors 
to 
improve 
service 
delivery 
and 
public 
accountability 
in 
line 
with 
the 
CDD 
principles. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
context that 
MASAF 
will 
support, 
among 
other 
things, 
new 
initiatives related 
to 
economic 
productivity 
under 
agriculture, 
energy, 
community 
savings 
and investment promotion, 
the 
application 
of 
indigenous 
knowledge 
practices 
and 
participatory 
community 
monitoring 
tools 
for 
enhanced 
public 
accountability. 
The 
project 
also takes 
cognizance 
of 
the 
MDGs, 
to 
which 
Malawi 
is 
a 
signatory, 
which 
were 
agreed 
to 
at 
the 
Millennium 
Declaration 
and 
signed 
in 
September 
2000 
by 
147 
Heads 
of 
States. 
The 
MDGs 
include: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
Eradicating poverty 
and hunger 
Achieving 
universal 
primary 
education 
Promoting 
gender 
equality and empowering 
women 
Reducing 
child 
mortality 
Improving 
maternal health 
Combating 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and other 
diseases 
Ensuring 
environmental sustainability 
Developing 
a 
global 
partnership 
for 
development. 
Financing 
of 
the 
MASAF 
Program 
is 
open 
to 
any 
funding 
agency; 
current 
sources 
are 
expected 
to 
include 
Government 
funds 
appropriated 
by 
Parliament, 
donor 
resources 
in 
the 
form 
of 
grants 
or 
loans, 
contributions 
by 
participating 
communities, 
CBOs 
and NGOs, and 
from 
any other 
source 
as 
directed 
by 
the 
MASAF 
Board. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
MASAF 
3-Community Empowerment and Development 
Project, 
the 
Government 
of 
Malawi 
has 
agreed 
with 
the 
World 
Bank to 
finance 
this 
operation 
using 
the 
APL, for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
1. 
The 
implementation 
plan 
for 
MASAF 
3 
will 
need 
to 
take 
a 
long-term 
perspective 
in 
order 
to 
appropriately 
subscribe 
to 
the 
MPRS 
long-term goal 
of 
sustainable 
poverty 
reduction 
through 
the 
social, 
economic and 
political 
empowerment 
of 
the poor, thereby 
ultimately 
contributing 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
MDGs. 
2. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
around 
10 
years 
will 
be 
needed 
for 
the 
LAs 
to 
develop 
adequate 
capacity 
to 
take 
over 
implementation 
management 
of 
most activities that 
MASAF 
will 
have 
been 
supporting. 
3. 
As 
this 
capacity 
is 
built, 
MASAF 
will 
undergo 
a 
progressive 
institutional 
transformation, 
corresponding 
to 
attainment 
of 
certain 
management 
capacities 
by 
the 
LAs 
to 
assume, 
and 
effectively 
discharge, 
the 
specific 
devolved 
sectoral 
functions 
and 
services 
to 
the 
communities 
in 
the 
district. 
LAs 
will 
follow 
the 
MTEF 
in 
their 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
process, 
and projects 
submitted 
to 
MASAF 
for 
funding 
under 
the 
CDP 
will 
come 
from 
the 
District 
Development 
Plans 
that 
clearly 
reflect 
the 
recurrent 
expenditure 
commitments 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
proposed 
annual 
investment 
plans. 
Allocation 
of 
resources 
by 
MASAF 
to 
districts 
will 
be 
based 
on 
annual 
investment 
plans 
to 
be 
guided 
by 
IPFs. 
The 
annual 
disbursements 
of 
funds 
from 
MASAF 
to 
LAs 
will 
be 
based 
on 
fulfillment 
of 
sub-proiect 
delivery 
benchmarks 
that 
will 
include effective completion 
of 
previously 
funded 
projects. 
-

Page  34
MASAF 
will 
work with 
the 
LAs 
to 
enhance 
their 
development 
management capacities 
and thereby 
strengthen the 
phased 
implementation 
of 
the 
Decentralization 
Program; 
MASAF 
will 
aim 
at 
strengthening 
local 
governance 
and 
community participation 
in 
decision-making 
and 
management 
of 
the 
development 
process, 
through 
the 
local 
level 
structures 
of 
Village 
Development 
Committees 
and 
Area 
Development 
Committees. 
By 
Component: 
Project 
Component 
1 
- 
US$28.48 
million 
Community 
Development Projects 
(CDPs) 
(IDA 
funding 
US$11.8 
million; 
IDA 
grant 
of 
US9.2 
miilion) 
This 
component combines 
two 
of 
the current 
components 
under 
MASAF 
11, 
Community 
Sub-projects 
and 
Public 
Works 
Program, 
for 
effective 
integration 
into 
the 
LA 
management 
framework. 
It 
will 
continue 
to 
finance demand-driven community-based socio-economic activities, 
including 
infrastructure, 
which 
include 
inter 
alia: 
construction 
and/or 
rehabilitation related 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
basic 
social 
services 
in 
health, 
education and 
water; 
afforestation, terracing, 
community 
roads 
and 
bridges, 
community 
centers, 
food 
processing 
technologies, 
energy 
efficiency 
interventions, 
training, 
and 
others. 
Improved facilitation 
will 
allow 
communities 
to 
articulate 
their 
priority 
development 
concerns 
within 
the 
social 
fund 
(SF) 
criteria 
and the 
District 
Planning 
Framework; 
priorities 
that 
emerge 
outside the 
SF 
menu 
will 
be 
linked 
to 
other 
relevant 
existing 
programs. 
Eligible 
sub-projects 
are 
derived 
from 
activities 
that 
deliver 
a 
community good 
rather 
than 
an 
individual 
benefit, and 
will 
be 
within 
the approved 
District 
Development 
Framework 
built 
on 
Village 
Action 
Plans 
reflecting 
priority 
community 
needs. 
The 
CDP 
component 
is 
based 
on 
the 
five 
community 
service 
packages 
of 
health, 
education, 
food 
security, transport 
and communication, and 
water 
and 
sanitation. 
The 
packages 
have been 
defined 
by 
the 
various 
sectors, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
capacities 
of 
LAs, 
NGOs/CBOs, 
and communities 
who 
will 
be 
implementing 
them. 
CMPs 
will 
be 
single 
community 
sub-projects 
implemented 
by 
the 
community's 
democratically 
elected 
PMCs; 
LAMPs 
will 
be 
multi-community 
sub-projects 
and 
those 
requiring 
labor-intensive 
technologies 
to 
implement. 
The 
LAMPs 
have 
a 
safety 
net 
element 
while 
creating 
assets; 
at 
least 40% 
of 
the 
funds 
paid 
by 
MASAF will 
be 
for 
unskilled 
labor. 
Costs associated 
with 
asset 
management 
after 
LAMP 
sub-projects 
completion 
will 
be 
costed 
and 
provided 
for 
on 
a 
sliding 
scale 
of 
75%, 
50%, 
and 
25% 
of 
the 
unskilled 
labor 
component; 
this 
funding 
will 
come 
from 
the 
US$1 
million 
provided 
for 
under 
the Safety 
Nets 
Levy. 
Projects 
that 
fall 
within 
the 
agreed 
thresholds 
(IDA 
contribution 
of 
US$20,000 
for 
CMPs 
and 
US$40,000 
for LAMPs) 
will 
be 
appraised and 
approved 
by 
the 
DEC 
(as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
within 
the 
district 
plan 
approved 
by 
the 
LA), 
and 
endorsed 
by 
the 
LAs 
during 
their 
regular 
meetings. 
Any 
sub-projects outside the service 
norms 
and 
above 
the sub-project 
average 
cost 
shall 
be 
desk 
and 
field 
appraised 
by 
the 
respective 
sector 
supported 
by 
the 
ZO 
and 
MU. 
For 
these 
sub-projects, 
the 
NTAC 
shall 
review 
and approve 
for 
endorsement 
by 
the 
Board 
provided 
that the 
sub-projects 
are 
within 
the 
funding 
envelope 
of 
the 
given district. 
The 
MU 
will 
prepare 
consolidated 
requests 
and 
submit 
them 
to 
NTAC, 
which 
will 
meet 
before 
MASAF 
Board 
meetings, 
review 
the 
requests, 
and make 
recommendations 
to 
Board. 
The 
Director 
of 
Finance 
in 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
be 
Secretary 
to 
the 
NTAC. 
In 
no 
event, unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA'S 
contribution 
to 
a 
CMP 
or 
a 
LAMP 
exceed 
an amount equivalent 
to 
US$60,000. 
Under 
MASAF 
3, 
funds 
for 
CMPs 
will 
continue 
to 
be transferred 
by 
MASAF 
MU 
directly 
to 
communities, 
while 
funds 
for 
LAMPs 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
Districts, 
who 
are 
responsible 
for 
their 
use, 
including 
the 
payments 
to 
the 
beneficiaries. 
As 
LAs 
develop capacity, measured 
by 
pre-agreed 
benchmarks, 
all 
CDP 
resources 
will 
be transferred 
to 
them 
for 
disbursement. 
The 
successful 
integration 
of 
CDP 
into 
LA 
management 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
a 
Joint 
MASAF-Local 
Government Technical 
Team. 
Outputs 
from 
the component 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
specified indicator 
targets 
under 
MDG 
2, 
3, 
5, 
7, 
and 
8.

Project Component 
2 
- 
US$24.00 
million 
Social 
Support 
Projects 
(SSP) 
(IDA 
grant 
of 
US$18 
million) 
The 
SSP 
component 
directly 
targets 
vulnerable 
groups 
through 
NGOs/CBOs who 
have a 
history 
of 
working 
with 
such groups. 
The 
component stimulates and 
supports 
traditional coping 
systems 
which 
rely 
on 
the 
extended 
family 
to mitigate 
against 
foster 
households 
experiencing 
deepening 
poverty 
after 
taking 
in 
vulnerable individuals. 
The 
vulnerable 
include 
inter 
alia: 
widows 
and 
widowers, 
the 
aged, 
orphans 
and 
foster 
parents, 
the 
destitute, 
the 
disabled, persons 
affected 
by 
HIVIAIDS, 
and 
malnourished 
under-fives. 
The project 
will 
finance 
initiatives 
identified 
by 
communities 
working 
with 
NGOs/CBOs, 
and 
these 
projects 
will 
contribute 
to 
household 
food 
and 
nutrition 
security 
for 
the 
vulnerable 
individuals 
and 
foster 
households. 
The 
component 
will 
assist 
in 
the 
development 
of 
long-term 
capacity and 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to NGOs/CBOs 
working directly 
with 
the 
vulnerable 
groups at 
the 
district, 
ward, 
and 
village 
levels. 
Activities 
to 
be 
funded 
under 
this 
component 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
specific 
needs 
of 
the 
vulnerable 
group, 
but, 
based 
on 
experience 
under 
MASAF 
11, 
will 
include 
support 
in 
skills 
provision, 
special 
training 
needs, 
provision 
of 
grants 
for 
tools and 
other 
productive 
assets 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
community-level 
interventions, 
and 
stimulation 
of 
productive 
activities 
for 
foster 
households. 
Through 
a 
participatory 
process, 
communities 
would 
identify 
vulnerable 
groups 
to 
be 
supported, 
and 
NGOsKBOs 
would 
be 
chosen 
by 
the 
beneficiaries 
to 
assist 
them 
develop 
interventions 
that 
contribute 
to 
improvements 
in 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
the 
vulnerable. 
The 
sub-projects 
shall 
be 
appraised 
and 
approved 
by 
a 
District 
Technical Team (comprised 
of 
the 
DEC 
and 
CSO/NGO/CBO 
members), 
as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
within 
the 
district 
plan 
approved 
by 
the 
LA; 
these 
will 
be 
endorsed 
by 
NTAC 
for 
forwarding 
to 
the 
Board. 
Funding 
will 
be contingent 
upon NGOs/CBOs 
meeting 
pre-defined 
eligibility 
criteria, 
which 
includes 
a 
cash, 
or 
in-kind 
contribution 
of 
20% 
(from 
the 
Project 
Implementing 
Agency, 
and 
the 
community 
if 
they 
are 
able 
to 
contribute), 
and the 
activity 
falls 
within 
the 
sub-project 
menu. 
The 
average 
cost 
of 
IDA 
contribution 
for 
each 
of 
these 
sub-projects 
is 
US$lO,OOO. 
Any 
sub-projects outside 
the 
service 
norms and 
above 
the sub-project 
average cost 
shall 
be 
desk 
and 
field 
appraised 
by 
the 
respective 
sector 
supported 
by 
the 
ZO 
and 
MU. 
In 
no 
event, 
unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA's 
contribution 
to 
an 
SSP 
exceed an 
amount 
equivalent 
to 
US$30,000. 
This 
component 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
specified 
indicator 
targets 
under 
MDG 
4,6, 
and 
8. 
Project 
Component 
3 
- 
US$ 
11.87 
million 
Community 
Savings 
and 
Investment Promotion 
(COMSIP) 
(IDA 
contribution 
of 
US$9 
million) 
Drawing 
on 
lessons 
from 
the 
SSP 
component 
of 
MASAF 
11, 
wherein 
groups 
which 
increased 
their 
capacity 
to 
generate 
incomes have 
used 
this 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
the vulnerable, 
or 
saved 
income 
to 
meet 
unexpected 
expenses, 
this 
component 
will 
assist 
in 
transforming 
the 
social 
capital 
built 
into 
economic capital. 
Community 
groups 
who 
participated 
in 
Community 
Sub-projects 
and 
the 
Public 
Works 
Program 
under 
MASAF 
I1 
have 
shown an interest 
to 
save 
and 
increase 
their 
access 
to 
credit. 
This 
component 
will, 
given 
the 
few 
formal 
opportunities 
for 
saving that 
exist, 
promote 
a savings 
and 
investment 
culture 
among the 
poor. 
Support 
under 
this 
component 
will 
not 
include 
the 
transfer 
of 
monies 
for 
savings 
or 
credit 
purposes, 
but 
will 
include 
promotion 
of 
COMSIGs 
of 
10-15 
members 
each. 
COMSIGS, 
if 
desired, 
will 
be 
supported 
to 
come together 
with 
a 
minimum 
of 
10 
required, 
to 
form 
COMSICs. 
Finance 
will 
be provided 
for 
capacity 
building 
activities 
for 
COMSICs, 
including 
training, 
simple 
infrastructure, 
and stationery, 
and 
a 
minimum 
of 
20% 
community 
contribution 
in 
cash 
or 
kind 
will 
be 
required. 
The 
sub-projects 
managed 
by 
COMSIC 
PMCs 
have 
an 
average cost 
of 
US$lO,OOO 
from 
IDA 
contribution, and 
all 
proposals 
under 
this 
component 
will 
be 
appraised 
by 
the 
District 
Technical 
Team, 
comprised 
of 
the 
DEC 
and 
CSO/NGO/CBO 
members, 
who 
will 
recommend 
to 
NTAC 
for 
approval. 
Any 
proposal 
outside 
of 
this 
ceiling 
will 
require an 
appraisal 
which 
includes 
the 
ZO 
and 
MU, 
and, 
in 
no 
event, 
unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA's 
contribution 
to 
a 
COMSIC 
exceed 
an 
amount equivalent 
to 
US$lO,OOO. 
To 
ensure 
that the 
poor 
operate 
in 
a 
viable 
and 
sustainable savings 
and 
credit 
environment, 
COMSICs 
will 
be 
linked 
to 
legally-constituted 
MFIs, 
such 
as 
the 
Malawi 
Savings 
Bank, 
which 
currently 
provides an 
opportunity 
for 
communities 
to 
participate 
in 
its 
savings 
program.

The 
promotion 
of 
COMSIGs 
and COMSICs, 
and 
piloting 
community-MFI 
interfaces 
will 
be 
phased 
to 
ensure 
that a sustainable 
savings 
and 
investment 
program 
for 
the 
poor 
is 
in 
place. 
The 
COMSIP 
component 
provides 
a 
mechanism 
for 
communities 
to 
attain 
food, 
nutrition, 
and 
economic security 
having 
taken 
advantage 
of 
resources 
made available 
through 
other components 
of 
MASAF. 
As 
noted 
above, 
while 
IDA 
resources 
will 
be 
used 
for 
mobilizing 
communities 
to 
save, 
training 
on 
improved 
business 
skills, 
and 
provision 
of 
simple infrastructure and 
safes 
in 
a suitable 
COMSIC 
clubhouse, 
only 
money 
saved 
by

(including 
any 
funds 
deposited 
by 
the 
LAMP 
component 
on 
behalf 
of 
a 
beneficiary) 
will 
be 
available 
for 
borrowing 
by 
individuals 
and 
groups, 
and 
COMSIGs 
will 
be 
free to 
lend 
to 
their 
own 
members 
in 
line 
with 
their 
rules. 
MASAF 
will 
ensure 
that 
COMSICs 
are 
put 
in 
touch 
with 
private providers 
of 
financial 
services 
who 
can 
extend market-driven 
services 
to 
these 
Clubs. 
Participation 
in 
savings clubs 
will 
be 
an 
important indicator 
of 
persons 
having 
graduated 
from 
poverty 
and 
therefore 
no 
longer 
in 
need 
of 
support 
under 
the 
SSP 
and 
LAMP. 
The 
success 
of 
this 
component 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
specified

Transparency and Accountability Promotion 
(TAP) 
(IDA 
contribution 
US$6 
million) 
MASAF will 
document and 
transform 
its 
experiences 
from 
working 
with 
communities 
into 
capacity 
enhancement 
interventions 
which 
can 
support various partners 
implementing 
decentralization 
(such 
as 
LAs), 
and 
the 
MPRSP 
(such 
as 
NGOs 
and CBOs). 
This 
component 
will 
develop suitable 
technical 
guidelines, 
generate data 
from 
the 
work 
of 
communities and 
partner 
institutions, 
process such data 
into 
useful information, 
disseminate, 
and 
package 
it 
into 
suitable 
materials 
for 
training. 
Development 
partners 
are 
keen 
to 
promote community-level 
transparency 
and 
accountability through 
a suitable 
development 
communication 
strategy, 
and 
to 
equip communities 
with 
skills 
to 
demand 
the 
same 
from 
LAs 
and 
other 
institutions. 
This 
component 
will 
develop 
appropriate 
tools 
for 
these 
processes 
through 
a 
community-level 
monitoring 
system 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
community 
service 
packages. 
It 
will 
finance 
the 
training 
of 
MASAF 
staff, 
district 
agencies, 
NGOs/CBOs, 
and 
PMCs 
in 
the 
use 
of 
procedures, 
systems 
and 
criteria 
developed 
to 
improve 
implementation. 
All 
MASAF 
activities 
will 
strengthen 
technical 
standards 
for 
improved 
quality, and 
a system 
to 
collect, 
analyze, 
and 
disseminate 
information 
on 
progress 
and 
impacts. 
This 
component 
will 
also focus 
on 
developing an 
effective 
MIS 
which 
will 
feed 
into 
the 
overall 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system. 
The 
Project 
will 
work 
within 
the 
existing 
M&E 
framework 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
MPRSP. The 
outcome 
indicators 
of 
MASAF 
3, 
12 
MDG 
indicator 
targets 
which 
can 
be 
delivered 
by 
communities, 
will 
be 
tracked 
at 
LA-level 
against 
the 
LA’S 
baseline 
and 
reported 
nationally 
by 
MASAF 
MU 
through 
NACCEA. 
Outputs and 
outcomes 
from 
MASAF 
interventions 
will 
complement the 
District 
Databank 
System, 
the 
Malawi 
Socio-Economic 
Database 
(MASEDA), 
the 
CWIQ, 
and 
others 
either 
planned 
or being 
tested 
in 
the 
districts. 
Until 
these 
are 
functional, 
MASAF 
3 
will 
use 
its 
own 
management 
information 
system 
and 
others 
like 
the 
Health 
Management 
Information 
System 
to 
track indicators. 
The 
outputs 
of 
these 
various 
sub-systems 
will 
be 
brought 
together 
under 
a 
knowledge 
and 
information 
sharing 
system 
and 
make 
MASAF 
a 
leaming 
organization 
as 
it 
transforms 
into 
a 
training 
and capacity 
building 
institution.  The 
component 
will 
provide 
secretariat 
support 
to 
the 
CDDAC 
chaired 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Economic Planning 
and 
Development 
to 
review 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
reports, 
make 
recommendations 
to 
the 
MASAF 
Board, 
and 
disseminate 
results 
on

Sector 
Ministries 
performance 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
community 
service packages 
and attainment 
of 
MDG 
targets. 
The 
CDDAC 
will 
bring 
together various 
stakeholders 
who 
advocate 
for a 
CDD 
approach, 
and 
make 
public 
its 
reports 
on 
participatory monitoring. 
This 
is 
a cross-cutting 
component 
to 
capacitate 
implementing 
agencies 
in 
the achievement 
of 
Malawi 
MDG 
targets.

of 
MASAF 
to 
-

- 
Page  37
deliver 
in 
a 
transparent 
and accountable 
way. 
It 
will 
finance the 
continued 
provision 
of 
technically 
competent 
staff 
to 
work 
at 
the 
MASAF 
MU, 
and 
strengthen 
LA 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
community 
sub-project 
cycle 
with 
technical and 
financial 
expertise. 
Financial 
accountability 
procedures 
already 
in 
place under 
MASAF 
I1 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
LAs 
implementing 
CMPs. 
In 
the 
long-term, 
Zones 
will 
be 
wound 
up 
as 
LAs 
provide 
their 
own 
staff 
to 
manage 
all 
CDPs. 
In 
the 
transition 
period, 
LAs 
will, 
on 
an 
annual 
basis, 
be 
offered 
one 
of 
three options: 
(a) 
use 
their 
own 
staff, 
with 
a 
MASAF 
accounts 
staff, 
to 
coordinate 
CDPs, 
(b) 
place short-term 
MASAF 
technical 
assistance 
under 
the 
Planning 
Officer or 
within 
the 
Community 
Development 
Office, 
or 
(c) 
obtain technical 
assistance 
from 
MASAF 
Zone 
and 
Field 
Offices. 
MASAF 
will 
reduce 
its 
current 
12 
Zones 
to 
3 
Zone 
Offices 
with 
9 
Field 
Offices 
before 
abolishing them 
as 
Districts 
take 
over 
the 
CDP 
component. 
Once 
80% 
(32) 
of 
LAs 
have 
taken over 
the 
CDP 
component 
with 
their 
own 
staff, 
MASAF 
will 
maintain 
a single 
national office; 
and 
continue 
to 
support the 
remaining 
8 
LAs, 
NGOs/CBOs, 
and 
COMSICs 
with 
implementation. 
As 
a 
training 
and 
capacity 
building 
institution 
for 
the 
CDD 
approach, 
MASAF 
will 
continue 
to work 
with 
PMCs, 
COMSICs, and NGOs/CBOs 
as 
community 
structures 
to 
sustain 
the 
CDD 
approach 
in 
Malawi. 
As 
an 
exit 
strategy 
for 
the Bank, 
the 
project 
will 
leave 
behind 
a 
legal framework 
for 
the 
CDD 
approach 
based 
on 
MASAF, 
PMCs, COMSICs, and 
NGOdCBOs 
working 
with 
LAs, 
communities, 
and 
sector 
ministries.

Projects

MASAF 
finances 
the

three 
sets 
of 
activities: 
(i) 
creating infrastructure 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
key 
services 
at 
the

(ii) 
creating

The 
economic 
rationale 
for 
MASAF 
is 
based 
on 
the 
following 
three 
principles: 
0 
MASAF 
fknds 
are 
essentially 
public 
funds 
and 
the 
activities 
financed 
by 
MASAF 
represent the 
highest 
priority 
use 
for 
public 
resources. 
MASAF 
is 
the 
least 
cost 
platform 
to 
deliver 
the 
public 
services 
indicated 
above. 
MASAF 
also 
has 
a 
number 
of 
externalities 
such 
as 
building 
community 
skills, 
laying 
the 
basis 
for 
decentralization 
of 
service 
delivery 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
and 
build 
capacity 
to 
meet 
emergencies. 
MASAF 
and 
Public 
Expenditure 
The whole 
range 
of 
MASAF 
activities 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
role 
of 
Government 
as 
envisaged 
in 
the 
MPRSP 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
joint 
BanWGovemment 
public 
expenditure 
review 
(PER). 
Both 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
the 
PER 
have 
identified 
social/physical infrastructure 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
primary 
health 
care, 
education, roads 
as 
the 
main 
constraints 
for 
growth 
and 
generating 
incomes 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
very 
poor. 
Both 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
the 
PER 
indicate 
that 
in 
each 
of 
these 
areas 
(primary 
schools, 
health 
centers, 
secondary roads) the 
demand 
is 
far 
greater 
than 
the 
facilities 
available and 
have recommended 
that 
expenditure outlays 
be 
increased 
- 
an objective that 
is 
achieved 
through 
the 
MASAF 
projects 
for 
- 
35 
- 
Page  40
expanding social 
services. 
The 
LAMPs 
and 
the 
SSPs 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
overall 
social 
safety 
net 
strategy 
adopted 
by 
the 
government (and elaborated 
in 
the 
MPRSP). 
As 
envisaged 
in 
the safety 
net 
strategy, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed to 
spend 
almost 
$25 
million 
per 
annum 
on 
programs 
to 
create 
incomes 
for 
the 
very 
poor who 
are 
unable 
to 
benefit 
from 
economic 
growth 
(See: 
November 
2000, 
The 
Government 
of 
Malawi, 
“ 
The 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
- 
FRDP 
III”, 
Memorandum 
of 
the 
President, 
P7419 
MAI). 
Within 
this 
concept, the 
LAMPs 
are 
programs that 
generate cash transfers 
for 
persons 
who 
suffer 
a temporary 
loss 
of 
income 
on 
account 
of 
economic 
emergencies whereas 
the 
SSPs 
are 
designed 
to 
create 
a 
sustainable 
income 
stream 
for 
the 
chronically poor 
and 
vulnerable 
in 
society. 
MASAF 
- 
A 
Least 
Cost 
Instrument 
0 
MASAF 
is 
also a least 
cost 
instrument 
for 
delivering 
infrastructure 
and 
social 
support 
to 
the 
poor. 
An 
analysis 
carried out 
in 
a recent 
study 
(January 2003, 
“Review 
of 
Cost Effectiveness 
and 
Design 
Standards”, 
EMC 
Jatula 
Associates 
Malawi) 
indicates 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
building 
a 
variety 
of 
structures 
such 
as 
classrooms, boreholes, 
bridges and 
pit 
latrines 
through 
MASAF 
is 
nearly 
30-50% 
less 
than 
the 
cost 
of 
similar 
structures 
constructed 
by 
other 
agencies 
such 
as 
other 
aid 
agencies, 
private 
contractors, 
Government 
departments 
and 
the 
National Road 
Authority. 
(See 
Table 
2). 
Cost 
effectiveness 
of 
MASAF 
approach 
will 
be 
ensured 
by 
ensuring 
rigorous 
appraisal 
standards, 
providing 
the 
communities 
with 
project 
menus, 
costed 
design options and 
the 
encouraging 
local 
competition 
in 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services. 
MASAF 
subprojects 
are 
also 
expected 
to 
be 
less 
costly 
and 
implemented 
quickly 
because 
the 
communities 
will 
share 
in 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
projects. 
0 
0 
Other 
benefits 
In 
addition 
to 
providing key 
services 
efficiently, 
MASAF 
activities 
will 
confer 
a 
number 
of 
additional 
benefits. 
These 
include: 
0 
Since 
MASAF 
relies 
on 
communities 
to 
identify, 
appraise 
and 
implement 
subprojects, 
we 
believe 
this 
will 
not 
only 
lead 
to 
better 
selection 
of 
subprojects 
but 
also 
contribute 
to 
building 
capacity 
at the 
community 
level which 
will 
be 
crucial to 
the 
success 
of 
the decentralization 
policy 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government. 
The 
capacity developed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
MASAF 
projects 
will 
be crucial 
to 
meet 
emergencies 
such 
as 
the 
one 
resulting from 
poor 
weather 
in 
2002. 
In 
these 
instances 
the 
public 
works 
programs 
could 
be 
rapidly 
expanded 
to 
augment incomes. 
The 
experience 
under 
the 
Bank’s Emergency 
Drought 
Recovery 
Credit 
shows 
that 
augmenting 
incomes 
and expanding 
food 
supplies 
are 
the 
two 
crucial 
elements 
of 
the Government’s 
food 
security 
strategy.

Annex 
6(A): 
Procurement Arrangements 
MALAWI: 
Third Social Action Fund 
Procurement 
General: 
A 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
has 
not 
been 
done 
for 
Malawi 
(it 
is 
planned 
for 
FY03) 
but 
the 
procurement 
system 
was 
reviewed 
in 
1996 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
consultants 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
Fiscal 
Restructuring 
and 
Deregulation Technical 
Assistance 
Credit. 
A 
number 
of 
recommendations were 
made 
to reform 
the procurement 
system 
including: 
(a) 
revising 
the 
existing 
procurement regulations 
to 
make 
them 
more 
transparent, 
efficient 
and 
economic; 
(b) 
developing and 
implementing 
a 
procurement 
training program 
for 
government staff; 
(c) 
preparing 
standard 
bidding 
documents 
and 
manuals; 
and 
(d) 
promulgating 
a 
procurement 
law 
based 
on 
the 
UNCITRAL 
model. 
Except 
for 
the 
last 
one, 
all 
the 
above 
recommendations 
are 
under implementation. 
A 
Procurement 
Bill 
has 
been drafted and 
presented 
to 
Cabinet. 
Procurement 
Capacity: 
An 
agency 
procurement 
capacity 
assessment has 
not 
been carried 
out 
for 
MASAF 
111. 
However, 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
be 
assessed 
are 
well 
known 
to 
the 
Bank 
through 
experience 
with 
them 
on 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
and 
these 
should be retained 
to 
implement 
MASAF 
3. 
Bank's 
experience 
through 
closely 
following 
up 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
under 
the last 
two 
MASAF 
projects 
has 
shown 
that 
no 
major 
procurement 
or 
contract 
administration 
issues 
that 
affected 
the 
successful 
implementation 
to 
the projects 
were 
encountered. 
PMCs, NGOs/CBOs, and 
staff 
at 
MASAF 
MU 
have 
all 
been trained 
in 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures. 
Based 
on 
the 
above, 
overall 
procurement 
risk 
to 
implement 
MASAF 
3 
is 
considered 
average. 
Procurement 
Arrangements: 
Procurement 
arrangements 
under 
MASAF 
3 
will 
utilize 
the 
procedures 
established 
and 
the 
lessons 
learned 
under 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11. 
As 
in 
the 
preceding 
credits, the exact 
mix 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
to 
be 
financed 
in 
the 
CDP 
and 
SSP 
components 
of 
the 
credit 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
results 
of 
demand-driven subproject 
identification. 
PMCs, CBOs/NGOs 
will 
take 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
procuring 
goods, services 
and 
civil 
works, 
but 
will 
receive support 
from 
the 
MU. 
The 
relationship and 
specific procurement responsibilities 
of 
the 
MU, 
LAs, 
NGOs/CBOs, 
and 
PMCs 
will 
be 
clearly 
spelled 
out 
during 
the 
orientation 
and 
training 
that 
precedes each subproject's 
implementation. 
Procurement 
monitoring 
and audit 
procedures 
will 
also 
follow 
the 
guidelines 
established 
under 
MASAF 
11, 
and 
are 
described 
in 
the 
Operational Manual, 
Accounting 
Manual 
and 
Community 
Development Projects 
Handbook. 
The 
LAs 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
for 
the 
LAMPS 
under the 
CDP 
component. 
The 
MU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
for 
the 
TAP 
and 
Institutional 
Development 
components. 
Several 
documents 
will 
guide 
procurement 
arrangements. 
MASAF 
will 
procure 
goods 
and 
services 
in 
accordance 
with 
the "Guidelines,  Procurement 
under 
IBRD 
Loans and 
IDA 
Credits, 
'I 
published 
in 
January 
1995 
and revised 
in 
January 
and 
August 
1996, September 1997, 
and 
January 1999. 
Consultants 
providing 
services 
to 
the 
project 
would 
be 
hired 
in 
accordance 
with 
the Bank's 
"Selection and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers" 
dated 
January 
1997 
and 
revised 
in 
September 
1997, January 
1999 
and 
May 
2002. 
Finally, 
the 
MASAF 
3 
Operational 
Manual 
contains 
more 
detailed 
descriptions 
of 
procurement 
procedures 
and 
their 
sequence 
within 
the 
project 
cycle; 
a 
draft 
Procurement 
Handbook, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Operational Manual, 
is 
being 
prepared. 
The 
procurement 
methods 
applicable 
to 
the various expenditure 
categories 
will 
be 
summarized 
in 
Table 
6A 
below 
and 
described 
in 
the 
following 
paragraphs.

A 
General Procurement 
Notice 
and Specific 
Procurement 
Notice 
will 
be 
published 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
Development 
Business 
and 
local 
newspapers 
for 
all 
ICB 
and QCBS. 
Notice 
is 
required 
to 
be given 
in 
sufficient 
time 
to 
enable 
prospective bidders 
to 
obtain pre-qualification 
or 
bidding 
documents 
and 
prepare 
and 
submit 
their 
responses. 
The draft 
GPN 
will 
be submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
prior 
review 
and 
approval. 
The 
GPN 
will 
be 
updated 
annually, 
showing 
all 
outstanding 
ICB 
for 
goods 
and 
consultant contracts 
under 
QCBS, 
and 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank. 
International 
Competitive 
Bidding 
(ICB): 
It 
is 
expected that 
approximately 
US$400,000 
worth 
of 
computers and vehicles 
will 
be 
purchased 
using 
ICB. 
National 
Competitive 
Bidding 
(NCB) 
shall 
be 
carried out 
for 
goods such 
as 
equipment, 
furniture 
and 
supplies estimated 
to 
cost 
more than 
US$30,000 equivalent, 
and 
up 
to 
and 
including 
US$lOO,OOO 
equivalent, 
per 
contract, 
up 
to 
an 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
US$450,000. 
NCB 
bidding 
documents 
for 
goods, 
currently 
being 
used 
by 
IDA 
projects 
and 
previously 
cleared 
by 
IDA, 
will 
be 
used. 
Shopping 
(National 
and 
International): 
National 
and 
international 
shopping 
for 
contracts estimated 
to 
cost less 
than 
US$30,000 equivalent, 
up 
to 
an aggregated 
amount 
of 
US$3 
million, 
may 
be 
used 
for 
goods 
to 
include 
equipment, 
vehicles, 
furniture 
and 
supplies. 
Community 
Participation: 
Under 
the 
CDP 
component, 
communities 
will 
be 
contributing 
to, 
and 
involved 
in 
the 
CMPs. Communities 
will 
manage subprojects, 
hiring 
skilled 
artisans 
and purchasing 
materials 
locally 
to 
ensure 
minimal 
delays 
and reduce 
inefficiencies 
due 
to 
loss 
during 
transport and 
storage. 
Standard 
price 
lists 
for 
materials 
will 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
MU, 
updated 
every 
three 
to 
six 
months, 
and 
will 
be 
used 
by 
communities 
as 
price ceilings 
to 
guide 
their 
procurement. 
The 
CMPs, 
sub-projects 
whose average 
IDA 
contribution 
is 
US$20,000 equivalent, 
would 
be implemented 
through 
self-help projects, 
which 
MASAF 
would 
contract 
out 
through 
PMCs to 
individuals, 
private 
contractors 
and 
community-based 
agencies 
following 
procedures 
detailed 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual. 
Such 
implementing 
agencies, 
selected 
on 
criteria 
established 
in 
the 
Handbooks 
for 
CDP-CMP 
and 
will 
use 
community 
labor and 
will 
purchase goods 
or 
materials 
through 
methods 
prescribed 
in 
their 
contract 
agreement 
signed 
with 
the 
community. Communities 
will 
hire 
contractors 
of 
the 
required 
skill 
level, 
which 
predetermines 
their 
wage rates, 
and 
procure materials 
by 
obtaining 
quotes 
from 
three 
suppliers, 
when 
available, and selecting 
the 
supplier 
with 
the 
lowest 
cost 
who 
fulfills 
their 
requirements. 
MASAF 
will 
disburse 
funds 
to 
the 
communities 
in 
tranches against 
certified 
completion. 
LAMP 
labor 
intensive 
works, 
which on 
average have an 
IDA 
contribution 
of 
US$40,000 
per 
sub-project, 
may 
be 
implemented 
through 
force 
account 
(see 
below), 
by 
public 
agencies 
through labor 
contracts 
with 
local 
communities 
and 
through 
contracts 
with 
qualified 
local 
village 
contractors 
selected, 
to 
the 
extent 
possible, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
at least 
three 
quotations 
(see 
procurement 
of 
small works 
below). 
When 
insufficient qualified 
local 
contractors 
are 
available, 
public 
agencies 
may 
resort 
to 
direct contracting 
with 
a 
local 
village 
contractor 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
prices 
periodically 
published 
by 
MASAF. 
The 
aggregate 
to 
be 
implemented 
through 
the 
CDP 
is 
US$21 
million 
equivalent. 
In 
no 
event, 
unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA's 
contribution 
to 
a 
sub-project 
under 
the 
CDP 
exceed US$60,000 equivalent. 
The 
SSP 
component 
and 
COMSICs 
will 
follow 
similar 
procurement 
arrangements 
as 
the 
CDP 
component.  Sub-projects 
costing 
US$30,000 
equivalent 
or 
less 
for 
SSPs 
(up 
to 
an 
aggregate 
of 
US$18 
million 
equivalent), 
and 
sub-projects 
costing 
US$lO,OOO 
equivalent 
or 
less 
for COMSICs 
(with 
an 
aggregate 
of 
US$9 
million 
equivalent), 
will 
be 
implemented 
through 
self 
help 
projects 
utilizing 
community 
participation 
procurement undertaken 
by 
NGOs/CBOs 
(e.g., 
the 
Project 
Implementing 
Agency, 
in 
consultation 
with 
Community 
Support Committees) 
for 
SSPs, 
and 
by 
PMCs for 
COMSICs. 
In 
no 
event, 
unless 
otherwise 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
shall 
IDA's 
contribution 
to 
a 
sub-project 
under 
the 
SSP 
-40- 
Page  45
exceed 
US$30,000 
equivalent, 
or 
exceed 
US$ 
10,000 
equivalent 
for 
COMSICs. 
Procurement 
of 
Small Works: 
Works 
estimated 
to 
cost 
$25,000 
equivalent 
or 
less 
per 
contract under 
the 
LAMPS 
may 
be 
procured 
under 
lump-sum 
fixed-price 
contracts 
awarded 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
quotations 
obtained 
from 
three 
(3) 
qualified 
domestic contractors 
in 
response 
to 
a 
written 
invitation. 
The 
invitation 
shall include 
a 
detailed description 
of 
the 
works, 
including 
basic specifications, the 
required completion 
date, 
a basic 
form 
of 
agreement acceptable 
to 
the 
Association, 
and relevant 
drawings, where applicable. 
The award 
shall be 
made 
to 
the 
contractor 
who 
offers 
the 
lowest 
price 
quotation 
for 
the 
required 
work, 
and 
who 
has 
the 
experience 
and 
resources 
to 
complete 
the 
contract successfully. 
Force 
Account: 
Works 
under 
the 
LAMPS 
which 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
paragraph 
3.8 
of 
the 
Guidelines, and 
costing 
US$9,000,000 
equivalent 
or 
less 
in 
the 
aggregate, 
may, 
with 
IDA'S 
prior 
agreement, 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
force 
account 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provision 
of 
paragraph 
3.8 
of 
the 
Guidelines. 
Consultant 
Services: 
The 
project 
will 
finance consultant 
services, 
technical 
assistance, 
workshops, 
and 
training 
activities 
to 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
US$6 
million 
equivalent. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
contracts 
for 
undertaking 
beneficiary 
assessments 
and 
some 
technical 
studies 
will 
attract 
international 
consultant 
services 
while 
the 
remainder 
will 
be mostly 
local. 
Contracts 
with 
firms 
for 
assignments 
of 
US$lOO,OOO 
and 
above 
will 
be awarded 
through 
the 
Quality 
and 
Cost-Based 
method 
of 
selection; 
the 
short 
list 
of 
consultants 
for 
services, 
estimated 
to 
cost 
less 
than 
US$ 
100,000 
equivalent per 
contract, 
may 
comprise 
entirely 
of 
national 
consultants 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraph 
2.7 
and footnote 
8 
of 
the 
Consultant 
Guidelines. 
Contracts 
with 
firms 
below 
US$50,000 
may 
be 
awarded 
through 
the 
Consultant 
Qualification 
selection method, 
or 
least-cost 
selection 
when 
the 
assignment 
is 
of 
a 
routine 
nature 
(such 
as 
the 
printing 
of 
newsletters). 
Single-Source 
Selection, 
which 
does 
not 
provide 
the 
benefits 
of 
competition, 
may only 
be 
used 
in 
line 
with 
the 
conditions 
set 
forth 
in 
paragraphs 
3.8 
to 
3.1 
1 
of 
the Consultant 
Guidelines 
(e.g., 
hiring 
of 
the 
Malawi 
Broadcasting 
Corporation 
to 
air 
advertisements 
for MASAF). 
Services 
of 
individual 
technical 
consultants 
and contractual technical 
specialists 
will 
be 
procured 
under 
individual 
contracts 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
paragraphs 
5.1 
- 
5.3 
of 
the 
"Selection and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers." 
Procurement 
Plans: 
MASAF 
has 
prepared 
a 
draft 
procurement 
plan 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
finalized 
prior to 
Board 
Approval. 
The 
procurement 
plan 
will 
be 
updated 
on 
an 
annual 
basis, 
three 
months 
prior to 
the start 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year, 
and 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
for 
approval.

Summary 
of 
the 
Financial Management 
Assessment 
The 
MASAF 
3 
Program 
will 
be 
implemented over 
a 
period 
of 
12 
years, 
with 
Phase 
I 
lasting 
3 
years, 
Phase 
I1 
for 
5 
years, 
and 
Phase 
In 
for 
4 
years, 
utilizing 
the 
APL. 
Using 
Financial 
Management 
Guidelines 
for 
financial 
management 
capacity 
assessment 
in 
World 
Bank 
financed projects and 
the 
Community 
Driven 
Development 
Guidelines, 
it 
was 
concluded 
that 
the 
program 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
a 
medium 
risk 
environment. 
This 
conclusion 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
fact 
that the 
program 
deals 
with 
communities 
which 
have 
limited 
capacity 
to 
manage 
funds 
of 
the 
magnitude 
being 
envisaged 
by 
this 
program. 
Naturally, 
CDD 
projects 
are 
risky 
owing to 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
actors 
and 
the 
fact that 
the 
sub 
projects 
being 
implemented 
by 
communities 
are 
scattered 
all 
over 
the 
country, 
making 
control 
of 
activities 
difficult. 
Further, 
an 
assessment 
of 
audit 
reports 
received 
from 
the 
various 
LA 
through 
which 
the 
program 
will 
be implemented reveal 
limited 
capacity. 
The 
human 
capacity 
of 
such 
Authorities 
and 
accounting 
systems 
used 
have 
been 
assessed 
as 
extremely weak 
except 
for 
a 
few. 
As 
outlined 
in 
the 
recently 
completed 
draft 
CFAA 
report 
(Malawi 
CFAA 
draft 
report 
of 
April 
2002), 
Malawi 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
Report-Issues 
and Options 
(PER-Issues 
and Options 
September 
ZOOl), 
and 
Tracking 
Poverty-Reducing 
Spending 
in 
HIPCs: 
Country 
Assessment 
and 
Action 
Plan 
for 
Malawi 
(Tracking Poverty 
spending 
in 
HIPC-November 
27,200 
I), 
there are 
problems 
with 
Malawi 
national 
budget 
execution. 
There 
is 
poor 
linkage between 
policies 
that 
govern 
budget 
formulation 
and 
outputs 
from 
the 
same, 
less 
transparent 
budget 
execution 
methods, inadequate 
assurance 
that 
allocated 
resources are 
used 
economically 
and 
efficiently 
for 
the 
intended 
purposes, 
and an 
absence 
of 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
budget 
formulation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
execution. 
Specifically 
for 
this 
operation, 
the 
risks 
arise 
from 
the 
following: 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
in 
the 
LAs 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
handling 
funds 
for 
disbursement 
to 
communities 
and 
demanding 
its 
accountability 
is 
low. 
The 
volume 
of 
funds 
the respective 
authorities 
will 
be 
handling 
is 
far 
larger 
than 
what 
they 
are 
used 
to. Once 
the 
funds 
have 
been 
disbursed 
to 
LAs, 
the 
National 
Local 
Government 
Finance 
Committee 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
demanding 
accountability 
in 
liaison 
with 
the 
MASAF 
MU. 
However, 
there 
are 
only 
three 
financial 
management 
specialists at 
the 
Committee 
to 
perform 
this 
function. 
These 
have 
13 
LAs 
each 
to look 
after 
in 
terms 
of 
accountability. 
Adding 
the 
aspect 
of 
demanding 
accountability 
of 
funds 
for 
this 
operation 
places 
more 
burden 
on 
their 
workload. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
risk, 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
has 
very 
few staff 
to 
conduct 
audits 
of 
LAs 
to 
handle 
the 
program 
funds. 
The 
communities 
have experienced 
handling 
MASAF 
disbursed 
funds 
over the last 
seven 
years 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
MASAF 
I 
& 
11. 
However, 
a heavier 
inflow 
of 
resources 
to 
communities and 
the 
need 
to 
demand 
more accountability 
from 
the 
PMC 
places 
a 
big 
challenge 
on 
accountability. 
The 
risk 
here 
is 
that 
some 
PMCs may 
be 
less 
accountable 
to 
their 
communities 
and 
the 
LAs. 
While 
the 
Malawi 
Parliament 
approved a 
formula 
for 
allocating 
resources 
to 
LAs 
for 
development 
programs 
which 
will 
complement 
resources 
flowing from 
this 
operation, 
the 
actual 
flows 
of 
resources 
to 
the 
LAs 
have 
been 
quite 
problematic 
in 
the 
last 
fiscal 
year. 
Lesser 
resources 
than 
those 
approved 
in 
the 
budget 
have 
flowed to 
LAs, 
hence 
affecting 
progress 
of 
development 
programs. 
Government-wide, 
the 
Auditor 
General’s 
annual reports 
cite 
a 
number 
of 
cases 
of 
fraud, 
loss 
and 
poor

accountability, 
and 
a 
failure to 
reconcile large 
balances 
in 
Government's 
accounts. 
Below 
the 
line 
expenditures 
are 
significant and 
have 
not 
been reconciled 
to their 
respective 
bank 
accounts 
for 
significant 
periods 
of 
time. 
Of 
fundamental 
concern 
is 
the 
inability 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Economic 
Planning to 
control 
budget 
execution 
to 
its 
intended 
purpose. 
Financial laws and 
regulations 
in 
Malawi 
are adequate 
and 
accounting 
standards 
generally 
meet 
international 
standards. 
In 
January 2001, 
Malawi 
adopted 
the 
international accounting 
standards 
promulgated 
by 
the 
International Federation 
of 
Accountants 
(IFAC) without 
amendment 
as 
a basis 
of 
disclosure and preparation 
of 
accounts 
of 
entities operating 
in 
Malawi; 
the 
public 
sector, 
however, 
does 
not 
yet 
utilize 
these 
standards. 
The 
only 
standard 
issued 
for 
public 
sector 
on 
cash 
accounting 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
adopted 
by 
Malawi. 
There 
is 
a 
professional 
association 
of 
accountants 
(The 
Society 
of 
Accountants 
in 
Malawi) 
and 
Malawi 
is 
a 
member 
of 
both 
IFAC 
and 
the 
regional 
Eastern, 
Central 
and Southern 
Federation 
of 
Accountants. 
The 
accounting profession 
is 
well 
developed, 
especially 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
although 
the 
number 
of 
qualified 
accountants 
is 
still 
very small 
compared 
to 
demand 
for 
their 
services 
in 
the 
sector. 
Malawi 
moved 
to program 
budget 
classification 
from 
fiscal 
year 2001/2002. 
The 
budgets 
are 
consolidated 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and 
Economic Planning 
and approved 
by 
Parliament. 
Each 
Principal 
Secretary 
of 
a 
ministry 
is 
the 
controlling officer 
of 
that 
ministry 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
executing 
the 
budget. 
External audit 
for 
all 
government 
institutions 
is 
required 
by 
statute. 
Though very 
weak, each 
ministry 
has 
an 
internal 
audit function, 
which 
checks 
compliance 
with 
prescribed 
systems. 
Action 
Plan 
to Increase 
Capacity 
for 
Financial 
Management: 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
supervision 
of 
fiduciary 
aspects 
will 
be 
increased 
from 
the standard 
two 
missions 
to four 
missions 
per 
annum. 
Each 
quarter, 
the 
fiduciary 
team 
will 
carry out 
a 
documentation 
review 
of 
expenditures 
below 
the 
threshold 
at 
the 
MU 
and 
at 
certain 
selected 
LAs 
to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
IDA 
rules, 
and 
rules 
set 
up 
for 
running 
finances 
of 
this 
program 
as 
articulated 
in 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding. 
In 
addition, 
the

will 
be 
undertaken:

A 
comprehensive 
community training 
package 
for 
building 
capacity 
in 
communities 
and 
LAs 
in 
financial 
management based 
on 
the 
World 
Bank 
client training 
materials 
for 
CDD 
will 
be 
developed 
and 
delivered 
to 
communities and 
LA 
on 
a needs basis. 
A 
training 
plan 
for 
staff 
at the 
MU, 
staff 
at 
the 
zone 
and 
field 
offices 
and at 
LA 
level 
will 
be 
developed 
to 
address 
the 
issues 
of 
capacity. 
Each 
LA 
will 
be 
supplied 
with 
a 
computer 
to 
facilitate 
timely 
production 
of 
financial 
information. 
The 
National 
Local 
Government Finance Committee 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through Government's 
employment 
of 
nine 
assistants 
and 
the 
current 
staff 
preliminary 
basic 
financial 
management 
training 
needs 
will 
be 
incorporated 
in 
the 
MASAF 
3 
training 
program 
during 
the 
period 
of 
the 
APL. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
regular 
updating of 
the 
MASAF 
3 
Accounting 
Manual, 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
a 
comprehensive 
internal 
audit 
program 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
prescribed 
systems. 
Each authority 
will 
have 
an 
internal audit 
unit 
whose 
main 
function 
will 
be 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
prescribed 
systems 
and 
adherence 
to 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding. 
Before 
a 
sub-project 
is 
launched, 
the 
PMC 
will 
be 
trained 
for 
not more than 
five 
days 
by 
the 
DEC, 
supported 
by 
MASAF 
ZO 
in 
proper financial 
management 
systems 
of 
the 
program. 
Semi-annual audits 
of 
sub 
projects 
and 
ensuring 
that communities 
and 
LAs 
are 
complying 
with 
the 
systems 
put 
in 
place 
will 
be 
conducted.

Institutional 
and 
Implementation 
Arrangements: 
The 
lead 
coordinating 
agent 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
will 
be 
MASAF. 
Various 
directorships 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
institution 
for 
effective 
management 
of 
the 
components 
of 
the 
program. 
Efforts 
are 
under 
way to 
convert 
MASAF, 
which 
is 
currently 
a 
project 
MU, 
into 
a 
fully-fledged 
independent 
organization 
through 
an 
Act 
of 
Parliament. 
The 
MASAF 
MU 
will 
report 
to 
a 
Board 
which 
will 
meet 
every 
quarter 
to 
provide 
policy 
guidance 
on 
MASAF 
operations. 
This 
Board 
will 
have 
two 
sub-committees, 
namely 
NTAC 
and 
the 
NACCEA 
to 
support 
its 
work. 
The 
work 
of 
the 
first 
committee 
will 
be 
to review 
all 
sub 
projects 
coming 
through 
each 
Local 
Authority 
in 
line 
with 
sectoral 
norms and 
pre-agreed 
performance. 
The 
second 
committee 
will 
review 
monitoring 
and evaluation reports 
and 
advise 
on 
whether 
the 
program 
is 
meeting 
its 
intended 
objectives 
and 
benchmarks 
as 
initially 
outlined. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
the 
MU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
TAP 
and 
Institutional 
Development. 
The 
LAMPS 
will 
be implemented through 
LAs, 
as 
articulated 
in 
the 
Government’s 
Local 
Government 
Decentralization 
Policy 
of 
1998. 
For 
the 
CMPs 
and 
SSPs, 
these 
LAs 
will 
each 
be 
responsible 
for 
receiving 
the 
various 
requests 
from 
communities, 
through 
the 
Village 
Development 
Committees 
who 
will 
forward 
such requests 
to 
an Area 
Development Committee before 
finally 
sending 
it 
to 
the 
DEC. 
The 
DEC 
is 
a 
multi-sectoral 
institution 
at 
the 
LA 
level 
acting 
as 
a 
technical advisory 
body to 
the 
LA. 
Amongst 
other 
things, 
the 
DEC 
will 
appraise 
these 
requests, ensure 
that 
they 
fit 
in 
with 
the 
LA 
approved 
District 
Development 
Plan, 
and 
send 
them 
to 
the 
MASAF 
Board 
for 
funding. 
Any 
sub-project outside 
the 
Plan 
must 
first 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
LA 
for 
approval 
prior 
to 
forwarding 
to 
MASAF; 
it 
is 
projects 
included 
in 
the development 
plans 
of 
each 
LA 
that 
MASAF will 
fund. 
As 
such, 
MASAF will 
operate 
with 
three 
zones 
and 
nine 
field 
offices 
based 
on 
scaled 
down 
current 
zones, 
to 
support 
LAs 
with 
technical 
and 
management 
backstopping 
as 
LAs 
deliver 
according 
to 
agreed 
benchmarks. 
The 
COMSIP 
component 
will 
be 
implemented through 
three 
sub 
tiers-namely the 
community, 
LA 
and 
national level. 
At 
the 
community 
level, 
savings 
and 
investment 
promotion 
management 
committees 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
successful 
management 
of 
the 
COMSIG 
and 
COMSIC 
activities. 
At 
LA 
level 
the 
MASAF 
zone 
office 
and the 
DEC 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
all 
monitoring 
and 
supervision 
of 
operations 
and 
appraising 
COMSIC 
requests 
for 
infrastructure. 
Approval 
for COMSIC 
requests rests 
with 
the 
MU. 
The 
MASAF 
Board 
will 
be 
the 
supreme 
body 
responsible 
for 
policy 
guidance, 
approval, 
and 
ensuring 
consistency 
with 
program principles 
and 
objectives. 
Each 
LA 
will 
keep 
its 
own 
books 
of 
account. 
A 
computer 
will 
be 
given 
to 
each 
LA 
for 
recording 
MASAF 
funded 
accounting 
data. 
The 
communities 
themselves 
will 
keep 
their 
own 
books 
of 
account 
and 
supporting documentation 
of 
expenditures 
incurred. 
Since 
funds 
to 
communities 
will 
be 
tranched, each 
community 
will 
prepare a 
justification 
report 
which 
will 
be 
channeled 
to 
the 
LA 
for 
justification. 
The 
new 
zones 
(3) 
will 
become 
technical 
centers, 
with 
administrative 
work 
being 
undertaken 
by 
the 
LAs, 
with 
support 
from 
Field 
Offices. 
Zone 
staff 
will 
spend 
time 
in 
the 
LAs 
assisting 
with 
these 
processes 
so 
that capacity can 
be 
built 
there. 
Similarly, 
the Zone 
staff 
can 
go 
and 
work 
with 
Field 
Office 
staff 
in 
ensuring 
that 
the 
necessary 
capacity 
is 
developed 
at 
the 
LA 
level; 
Zones 
will 
not, 
however, undertake any 
administrative function, 
but 
will 
provide 
technical 
support.

from 
government 
entities 
and 
government 
managed 
projects 
in 
general. 
The 
instructions define responsibilities 
and 
level 
of 
authority 
within 
each 
Ministry. 
The 
treasury 
instructions and 
circulars 
require 
all 
government 
ministries 
to 
submit 
expenditure returns at 
the end 
of 
each 
month outlining 
expenditures 
incurred 
during 
the 
month, commitments 
made 
and 
cash 
balances 
in 
their 
holding 
accounts at the 
Reserve 
Bank 
at 
the 
end 
of 
such 
months.

Budgeting 
at 
LA 
level 
follows 
the 
Local 
Government 
Act 
of 
1998 
supplemented 
by 
the 
District 
Development 
Fund 
Financial 
Management 
and 
Accounting 
Procedures 
Manual. 
Once a 
community 
identifies 
a 
project, 
it 
will 
prepare 
the 
project 
proposal and 
may 
seek 
assistance 
from 
the 
Village 
Development 
Committee 
or 
others 
in 
its 
preparation, 
including 
cost estimates. 
The 
cost 
of 
community 
contribution 
to 
a 
project 
has 
to 
be 
estimated 
using 
a 
community contribution 
format. 
Such 
a 
proposal 
is 
normally 
passed 
onto 
the 
Area 
Development Committee 
which 
appraises 
it, 
selects 
and 
prioritizes 
the 
proposals 
including 
cost estimates 
for 
submission 
to 
the 
DEC. 
For 
MASAF 
sub-projects, appraisals 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
DEC. 
The 
Development 
Committees 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
promoting 
and 
monitoring 
progress 
of 
implementing 
agencies (PMCs, 
NGOs/CBOs). 
The 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
be 
required 
to 
give 
a 
simple 
one-page 
progress 
report 
to 
the 
Development 
Committees, 
and 
the 
LA 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis. 
In 
terms 
of 
this 
program, 
MASAF 
will 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
each 
planning 
year 
provide 
each 
LA 
with 
an 
IPF for 
resources 
available 
for 
funding 
of 
CDPs 
and 
SSPs. 
The 
allocation 
will 
be 
based 
on 
a 
formula 
from 
the 
National 
Local 
Government Finance Committee 
as 
approved 
by 
Parliament. 
The 
formula 
provides 
that 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
funds 
will 
be 
allocated 
based 
on 
population 
while 
the 
other 
50 
percent 
will 
be 
based 
on 
weighted poverty 
indicators. 
The 
MASAF 
Board 
will 
approve 
the annual 
allocations 
for 
each 
LA 
prior to 
the 
production 
of 
annual 
budgets. 
MASAF 
will 
then 
communicate 
to 
LAs 
their 
annual allocations 
for 
inclusion 
into 
the 
LA 
annual 
budget. 
No 
intra-district 
allocation 
is 
envisaged, 
as 
this 
might 
promote 
supply-driven 
development 
and introduce 
unnecessary 
rigidity. 
LAs 
should 
be 
encouraged 
to 
use 
similar criteria 
to 
target 
resources 
to 
areas 
with 
poor 
indicators 
within 
their 
geographic 
area, 
and 
remain flexible. 
Identified 
areas 
would 
be 
targeted 
by 
PRA 
teams. 
An 
Accounting 
Manual 
has 
been 
written 
which 
clearly 
articulates 
the 
various accounting 
processes, 
procedures, 
controls, 
and 
reporting 
requirements at 
community, 
LA 
and 
MASAF 
MU 
level. 
The 
Manual 
also shows 
the 
organizational 
structure 
of 
the 
new 
MASAF 
accounting 
department 
under 
the 
Director 
of 
Finance 
whose 
staff 
have 
been 
assessed 
as 
appropriate 
though 
an 
additional 
management 
accountant 
has 
been 
deemed necessary 
to 
be 
engaged 
to 
run 
a 
new 
wing 
of 
the 
accounting functions 
emanating 
from 
the 
design 
of 
this 
program. 
The 
manual 
also 
contains 
an appendix 
to 
guide 
persons 
who 
would 
want 
to 
check 
on 
financial 
i-ecords 
of 
communities and 
LAs 
as 
to what 
features 
they should 
look 
for. 
The 
manual 
is 
yet 
to 
develop accounting 
codes 
for 
the 
program. 
The 
codes 
to 
be 
developed 
are supposed 
to 
develop 
a 
linkage 
between 
the 
cost 
elements 
of 
the 
program 
to 
outputs 
and 
outcomes 
as 
defined 
as 
monitoring 
indicators 
of 
the 
operation. 
The 
program 
is 
going 
to 
use 
an 
independent 
system 
at 
MASAF 
MU 
and at 
LA 
level. 
This 
is 
the 
system 
that 
has 
been used 
all 
along 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11; 
the 
only 
upgrade done 
for 
this 
program 
is 
the software 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
produce 
FMRs. 
The 
upgraded 
accounting 
system 
is 
aimed 
at 
tracking 
financial 
transactions 
for 
the 
program 
once 
funding 
has 
been 
approved. 
On 
approval 
of 
individual 
LAMPS, 
MASAF’s 
management accounts 
section 
will 
analyze 
the 
approved budgets 
for 
correctness 
and 
open 
individual 
project 
accounts 
in 
the 
general 
ledger 
to 
which 
the 
approved amount 
will 
be 
posted. 
The 
PMCs for 
the 
CMP 
and 
COMSIC, 
and 
the 
NGOiCBO 
under 
SSP 
will 
open 
a 
project bank 
account 
into 
which 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
from 
the 
MASAF 
bank 
account. 
Payment 
of 
funds 
to 
sub-project 
accounts 
will 
be 
made 
in 
tranches 
of 
40%, 
30% 
and 
30% 
of 
the 
total 
MASAF 
contribution 
for 
PMCs; payment 
to 
NGOs/CBOs 
will 
be 
on 
a 
task 
basis. 
The 
last 
tranche 
of 
30% 
is 
provisional 
and 
paid 
subject 
to 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
actual 
funds 
required 
to 
complete the 
sub-project. 
Prior 
to 
release 
of 
the 
first 
tranche, 
the 
Director 
of 
Finance 
must 
ensure 
that the 
pre-launch 
training 
has 
been conducted 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
PMCs 
will 
start 
to 
utilize 
the 
funds 
immediately 
upon 
receiving 
the 
first 
check. 
Funds 
Flow 
Funds 
granted 
to 
Malawi 
Government under 
the 
MASAF 
program 
will 
be 
maintained 
in 
a 
Credit 
and 
-47-

Grant 
Account 
at 
the 
World 
Bank. 
They 
will 
be 
maintained 
in 
Special 
Drawing 
Rights. 
Such 
funds 
will 
be 
accessed 
through 
a 
special 
account 
maintained 
at 
Citi 
Bank 
in 
New 
York. The 
size 
of 
the programs 
special account 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
programs 
cash 
flow 
forecast 
for 
the period. 
The 
funds 
obtained 
from 
the 
Credit 
and Grant 
account 
through 
the 
special 
account 
will 
flow 
into 
a 
holding 
account at the 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
Malawi 
where the 
foreign 
currency 
will 
be 
converted 
into 
local 
currency 
at a 
rate 
of 
exchange 
ruling 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
transfer. 
The 
holding 
account 
is 
a transit account 
at 
the 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
Malawi 
established 
to 
regulate 
the 
flow 
of 
funds 
into 
the 
operating 
account 
maintained 
by 
MASAF 
at 
a 
commercial 
bank. 
Funds 
from 
an operating 
account 
will 
be 
disbursed 
to 
five 
distinct 
units 
to 
service 
the operations at 
different 
levels 
as 
outlined below. 
CMP 
Bank 
Accounts: 
Funds 
($60,000-IDA 
maximum 
per 
sub-project) 
will 
be transferred 
directly 
from 
MASAF 
operational 
account 
into 
a 
project bank 
account 
maintained 
by 
the 
PMC. 
LAMP 
Bank 
Accounts: 
Funds 
($60,000-IDA 
maximum 
per 
sub-project) 
will 
be 
transferred 
from 
the 
MASAF 
operational 
account 
into 
a designated 
LA 
bank 
account 
maintained 
by 
the 
LA, 
which 
will 
be 
entrusted 
with 
the 
responsibility 
to 
manage 
funds 
and implement labor intensive 
public 
works 
programs. 
SSPs: 
Funds 
($30,000-IDA 
maximum 
per 
sub-project) 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
bank 
accounts 
managed 
by 
NGOs/CBOs 
who 
are 
entrusted 
to 
work 
with 
vulnerable 
and 
marginalized 
persons 
in 
consultation 
with 
a 
Project 
Support 
Committee. 
There 
are 
clear guidelines 
and 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
the 
participation 
of 
NGOs/CBOs; 
the 
NGOsICBOs 
will 
also 
be 
accountable 
to 
MASAF. 
COMSIP: 
Funds 
for 
capacity 
building 
of 
communities 
will 
be 
held 
by 
TAP 
and retained 
in 
the 
MASAF 
operational 
account; 
funds 
for 
COMSICs 
to 
construct a 
small 
structure 
($10,000-IDA 
maximum 
per 
sub-project) 
will 
be 
transferred 
from 
MASAF 
operational 
account 
directly 
into 
a 
project bank 
account 
maintained 
by 
the 
PMC. 
TAP: 
Under 
this 
component 
activities 
will 
be 
managed 
from 
the 
operational 
bank 
account 
of 
MASAF 
MU 
by 
funding 
activity-based interventions 
to 
strengthen 
transparency and 
accountability 
objectives 
of 
the 
program. 
Accountability 
of 
Funds disbursed: 
Disbursement 
of 
funds 
to 
sub 
projects 
will 
depend 
on 
specified 
criteria 
stipulated 
in 
the 
accounting 
procedures 
manual and 
on 
the 
type 
of 
receiving 
account annotated 
above. 
Under 
CMPs, 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
directly 
to 
the 
community project 
account 
while 
under 
LAMPS 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
to 
special 
project 
accounts 
maintained 
at 
LAs. 
Funding 
to 
projects 
will 
be 
released 
in 
tranches 
of 
40%, 
30% 
and 
30% 
of 
the 
project 
budget. 
A 
Justification 
Report 
of 
expenditures 
incurred 
will 
be 
submitted 
as 
a 
precondition 
for 
the 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche 
once 
at 
least 
70% 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
is 
spent. 
The 
third 
tranche 
will 
be 
released 
when 
100% 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
and 
70% 
of 
the 
second tranches are 
successfully 
justified, 
and 
on 
production 
of 
mid 
term 
assessment 
report. 
These tranches 
will 
be 
followed 
up 
by 
formal 
communications 
to 
the 
DEC 
and 
zones 
that 
in 
turn 
will 
notify 
the respective 
PMCs. 
Disbursement 
under 
SSP 
and 
COMSIC 
will 
be 
activity 
based 
and 
funds 
related to 
NGOs/CBOs, 
and 
COMSIC 
PMCs. 
The NGOs/CBOs 
and 
LAs 
will 
be 
required to 
open 
a 
current 
bank 
account 
for 
all 
sub 
projects 
with 
a 
reputable 
bank 
within 
the 
project locality. 
The 
signatories 
to 
the 
bank 
account 
will 
be 
in 
line 
with 
the requirements 
of 
specific 
components. 
MASAF 
will 
ensure 
that 
PMCs, 
NGOdCBOs, 
and 
LAs 
are 
accountable 
for 
the 
resources 
given 
by 
MASAF 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
sub 
projects. 
The 
PMCs, 
NGOs/CBOs 
and 
DECs 
will 
be 
required 
to 
keep 
record 
of 
all 
financial 
transactions. 
Financial 
records 
will 
include: Petty 
cash 
balance report, 
bank 
statements, 
paid 
checks, 
payment 
vouchers, 
original 
receipts 
and 
cash 
sales 
signed 
by 
suppliers; 
a 
bank 
reconciliation, 
quotations, 
pro

invoices, 
and 
delivery/good 
received 
notes. 
Key 
stakeholders 
like 
Councillors, 
Members 
of 
Parliament, 
Area 
Development Committee and 
Village 
Development Committee 
and 
communities 
will 
monitor 
and 
get 
regular reports 
on 
the 
flow 
of 
funds 
and general 
financial 
processes. 
PMCs, NGOs/CBOs, and 
DECs 
must 
prepare an 
Expenditure 
Justification Report 
and 
submit 
it 
to 
the 
MU. 
The financial 
and 
physical 
report 
form 
should 
be 
dully 
completed and signed 
by 
an 
appropriate 
co"ittee/DEC 
members. 
Original 
receipts, vouchers, 
and 
labor 
payments 
should 
be 
included, 
completed and 
signedwitnessed 
as 
required, 
and 
there 
should 
be 
a 
recent 
bank 
statement 
and 
returned 
checks. 
Internal 
Audit: 
MASAF 
has 
an 
internal audit function 
whose 
main 
objective 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Board 
and 
management 
accomplish 
the 
MASAF 
mandate 
by 
ensuring 
that 
project delivery 
systems 
are 
functioning 
to 
expected 
standards. 
The 
capacity 
of 
the 
MU 
was 
assessed 
and 
found 
adequate. 
However, 
it 
needs 
strengthening 
by 
employment 
of 
more 
staff 
and developing 
a 
robust capacity 
building 
for 
the 
unit. 
The 
plan for 
covering 
the 
program 
was 
assessed 
to 
be 
adequate. 
The 
internal 
audit 
function 
for 
LAs 
which 
will 
audit 
LAs 
and 
operations 
on 
the 
ground 
was 
assessed 
as 
weak. 
This 
should 
be 
factored 
into 
an 
comprehensive 
capacity 
development 
program 
for 
government 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
TAP 
activities 
of 
this 
program. 
Management 
Information 
System: 
Efforts 
are 
underway 
to 
establish 
district 
based 
MIS. 
The 
MASAF 
MU 
has 
a 
computerized accounting 
system 
which 
uses 
Sun 
Accounting 
system. 
This 
system 
has 
been 
upgraded 
and 
can 
produce 
FMRs. 
The 
LAs 
will 
initially 
use stand-alone 
computers 
to 
record 
information 
and 
generate 
requisite 
reports. 
Agreed 
Financial Reporting 
Formats: 
The project 
will 
prepare and 
produce quarterly 
FMRs. 
The 
FMRs 
will 
comprise 
a 
financial, output 
monitoring 
and a 
procurement 
reports. 
These 
reports 
will 
provide 
information 
on 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
program 
in 
terms 
of 
financial 
activity, 
key 
output 
measures 
and 
procurement 
for 
the relevant 
quarter. 
As 
for 
the 
financial 
reports, 
they 
shall include 
a statement 
showing 
for 
the 
period 
and 
cumulatively 
cash 
receipts 
by 
sources 
and 
expenditures 
by 
main 
expenditure 
classification, 
beginning 
and ending 
cash balances 
of 
the 
program; and 
supporting 
schedules 
comparing 
actual 
and 
planned 
expenditures. 
The 
reporting 
line 
items 
in 
the 
FMRs 
will 
follow 
the 
projects 
chart 
of 
accounts. 
The 
cumulative 
FMRs 
over 
the 
project 
year 
will 
be 
consolidated 
and 
used 
as 
projects 
financial 
statement. 
This 
will 
result 
in 
a 
more 
cost 
effective 
reporting. 
As 
for 
output 
report, 
the 
project 
will 
include 
a 
narrative 
write 
up 
and 
output 
indicators 
linking 
financial 
information 
with 
activity 
indicators 
and 
highlight 
issues 
that 
require 
attention. 
In 
procurement 
reports 
under 
the 
FMRs, 
such 
reports 
will 
provide 
information 
on 
the 
procurement 
of 
goods, 
work 
and 
methods. 
This 
report 
will 
compare 
procurement performance 
against 
plan 
at 
the 
MASAF 
level 
only 
because 
planning community 
procurement 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
demand 
driven 
sub-projects; 
the 
report 
will 
be 
updated 
and 
highlight 
key 
procurement 
issues such 
as 
staffing 
and 
building 
capacity. 
The 
currency 
for 
the 
FMRs 
will 
be 
the 
Malawi 
Kwacha 
with 
the 
equivalent 
in 
dollars 
as 
a 
parallel 
column. 
This 
will 
become 
beneficial 
because 
while 
the 
books 
of 
accounts 
for 
the 
program 
will 
be 
kept 
in 
Kwacha, 
those 
of 
the 
special account 
will 
be 
in 
dollars 
which 
will 
give 
rise 
to 
issues 
of 
translation. 
The 
FMR 
preparation and submission 
will 
be 
done 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis. 
The 
FMRs 
will 
be 
used 
as 
a basis 
of 
disbursements. 
The 
reports 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Task 
Team 
Leader 
within 
45 
days 
of 
the 
reporting 
period. 
If 
such 
FMRs 
are 
not 
provided 
timely, 
the Task 
Team 
Leader 
will 
follow 
this 
up 
with 
the 
MU 
to 
determine 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
delay and 
planned 
date 
for 
submission. 
Late 
submission 
may 
result 
in 
the 
application 
of 
legal 
remedies 
for 
non-compliance.

In 
case 
the 
MASAF 
MU 
fails to 
meet 
the 
FMR 
requirements 
of 
the 
program 
at any 
one 
point, 
disbursement 
of 
funds 
to 
the

for 
goods 
and 
consultancies. 
The 
Statement 
of 
Expenditures 
procedure 
will 
be 
used 
for 
(a) 
contracts 
for 
goods 
valued 
at 
less 
than 
$100,000, 
(b) 
contracts 
for 
services 
of 
consulting 
firms 
valued 
at 
less 
than

(c) 
contracts 
for

of 
individual 
consultants 
valued 
at

(d) 
training, 
and 
(e) 
operating

When 
the 
Statement

Expenditure procedure 
is 
used, 
supporting 
documents 
will 
not 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
with 
withdrawal 
applications, 
but 
will 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
MASAF 
MU 
and 
made 
available 
for 
review 
by 
Bank 
supervision 
missions 
and 
the 
programs auditors. 
For 
the 
traditional 
disbursement method, 
the 
Special 
Account 
size 
will 
be 
$6,000,000, 
subject 
to 
increase 
based 
on 
the 
level 
of 
anticipated activities. 
Counterpart Contribution: 
Counterpart 
funds 
have 
been 
a 
problem 
in 
the 
Malawi 
portfolio 
in 
the 
past. 
With 
the 
recently 
concluded 
exercise 
on 
standard 
percentages 
for 
disbursement, 
it 
was agreed 
that 
the 
Government 
of 
Malawi 
would 
each quarter release 
the 
budgeted 
amount 
of 
counterpart 
funds 
as 
approved 
in 
the 
national 
budget. 
Foreign 
consultancy expenditures 
will 
be 
financed 
at 
100% 
and 
local 
expenditures at 
80%. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Audit 
of 
Public 
Enterprises 
which 
includes Government projects 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office, 
which 
uses 
International 
Organization 
of 
Supreme 
Audit 
Institutions 
standards 
when 
carrying out 
its 
audits. 
Annual 
audits 
of 
the 
MASAF 
program 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office 
or 
by 
an external auditor 
deemed 
acceptable 
to 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
external auditor 
were 
discussed 
and 
finalized 
during 
negotiations, 
and 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
final 
version 
of 
the 
Operational 
Manual; 
the 
audit 
will 
assess 
whether 
(a) 
the 
information 
is 
fairly 
presented 
for 
the 
specified 
period 
and 
cumulatively 
for 
the 
period 
with 
regard to project 
accounts 
and 
statement 
of 
sources 
and applications 
of 
funds 
and 
(b) 
reported 
disbursements 
were 
made 
in 
accordance 
with 
Development 
Financing 
Agreement and 
Project 
Appraisal 
Document. 
Owing 
to 
the number 
of 
components and the 
number 
of 
players, 
it 
shall 
be 
a 
requirement 
that 
separate 
semi-annual audits 
be 
carried out 
for 
purposes 
of 
checking 
on 
internal 
control, compliance 
with 
financial 
covenants, 
operation 
of 
special 
account, 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
management 
in 
achievement 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
program, 
budgetary 
control 
systems 
and 
performance 
of 
the 
management 
of 
the finance, 
accounting. 
These 
semi-annual audits 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
for 
respective 
six months 
periods 
as 
agreed 
with 
the 
Association and audit reports 
will 
be 
furnished 
to 
the 
Association 
no 
later than 
two 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
relevant 
six 
month 
period, 
as 
agreed 
with 
the 
Association. 
The 
separate semi-annual 
audits 
may 
be 
carried out 
by 
National 
Audit 
Office, 
or 
if 
it 
is 
jointly 
determined, 
or 
shown, 
that 
it 
cannot 
carry 
out 
the 
separate 
semi-annual audits 
in 
a 
timely 
fashion, 
they 
may 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
private 
auditors. 
3. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
Phase 
I 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
June 
30, 
2006, 
and 
the 
closing 
date 
will 
be 
December 
3 
1,2006. 
The 
proposed 
allocation 
of 
the 
credit 
is 
shown 
in 
Table 
6C. 
Reimbursements 
for 
subprojects 
under 
the 
CMP 
and 
COMSIP 
will 
be 
made 
on 
evidence 
of 
disbursements 
from 
the 
MU 
to 
PMCs; 
SSP 
reimbursements 
will 
be 
made 
on 
evidence 
of 
disbursements 
from 
the 
MU 
to 
NGOKBOs, 
and 
LAMPS 
reimbursements 
will 
be 
made 
on 
evidence 
of 
direct 
transfers 
of 
funds 
to 
the 
LA 
accounts. 
IDA 
will 
not 
finance 
taxes. 
To 
ensure 
this, 
IDA 
will 
only 
finance 
95 
percent 
of 
amounts 
paid 
by 
MASAF 
-

Page  55
under 
CDP,

and 
COMSIP 
components; 
100 
percent foreign,  and 80 percent 
of 
local 
expenditures 
on 
goods, 
and 
services 
(including 
consultant 
services, audits 
and 
training) 
will 
be 
at 
100 percent 
of 
foreign 
and 
80 percent 
of 
local, 
and 
incremental operating 
costs 
will 
be 
85 
percent 
for 
the 
first 
year, 
80 percent 
for 
the 
second year, and 75 
percent thereafter. 
Communities and 
GOM 
will 
contribute 
nearly 
23 
percent 
of 
total project 
costs; 
Government's 
indirect 
contribution, 
which 
includes 
salaries 
of 
technical 
staff 
performing 
desk 
and 
field 
appraisal 
as 
well 
as 
technical supervision 
of 
LAMP, 
is 
estimated at 
US$l 
million 
equivalent 
per 
year 
over 
the

by 
the

IDA 
will 
be 
informed 
once 
the 
account opened 
in 
the 
commercial 
bank 
and 
will 
deposit 
funds 
with 
the 
account once 
the 
project 
is 
effective. The 
size 
of 
the 
Special 
Account 
will, 
at 
each 
time, 
be determined 
by 
the cash forecast 
for 
the 
program 
submitted 
by 
MASAF 
MU. 
Cash forecasts 
accompanied 
by 
FMRs 
will 
originate 
from 
the 
MASAF 
management 
unit 
and 
be 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
Claims 
Unit 
to 
the 
World 
Bank. Payment 
instructions direct 
to 
suppliers 
will 
be 
sent 
through 
the 
same 
route 
through commercial 
banks 
as 
pursuant 
to 
World 
Bank 
instructions. 
Upon 
review 
and approval 
of 
the 
FMRs, 
or 
payment 
instructions, the 
World 
Bank’s Treasury Department 
will 
pay 
credit 
funds 
requested 
into 
the 
project’s 
Special 
Account 
at a 
commercial 
bank. 
Such 
funds 
will 
then 
be 
transferred 
from 
the 
Special 
Account 
to 
the 
Holding 
Account 
at 
the 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
Malawi 
before 
going 
into 
MASAF’s 
operational 
account at a 
commercial 
bank. 
The 
bank 
where 
the 
project 
account 
is 
maintained shall 
submit 
a 
letter 
of 
comfort 
on 
Bank 
funds 
from 
its 
headquarters 
to 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Upon 
receipt 
of 
such 
funds 
by 
the 
Reserve 
Bank 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
through 
the 
Special 
Account, 
the 
bank 
shall 
immediately 
notify 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
about 
the 
receipt. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
shall 
immediately 
issue a 
note 
called Credit 
Ceiling 
Authority 
to 
the 
project’s 
bank 
totaling 
the 
sum 
received. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
note 
is 
to 
inform 
the 
local 
commercial 
bank 
that 
the 
project 
is 
allowed 
for 
the 
period 
to 
issue 
out 
checks 
not 
exceeding 
the 
amount advised 
pending 
receipt 
of 
some 
more 
funds 
which would 
necessitate issuance 
of 
another 
credit 
limit 
increasing 
the 
limit 
for 
expenditure 
for 
the 
project. 
Payments 
paid 
through 
the 
local 
account 
and 
all 
related documentation 
will 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
MASAF 
MU 
for 
review 
by 
auditors and 
World 
Bank 
implementation 
support missions. 
Upon 
receipt 
of 
the 
commercial 
bank 
statements, 
the 
projects 
financial 
accountant 
shall 
reconcile 
the 
accounts 
before 
submitting 
the 
withdrawal application to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
for 
onward 
transmission through 
the 
commercial 
bank to 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
Special 
Account 
will 
be 
audited 
by 
an 
independent 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
which 
would 
be 
appointed 
prior to 
credit 
effectiveness 
based 
on 
audit 
scope 
as 
contained 
in 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The 
audited 
accounts 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
six 
months after the end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
from 
review.

MALAWI 
Policy 
Letter: 
Malawi 
Social 
Fund 
(MASAF) 
Phase 
I11 
1. 
I 
would like 
to 
express 
my 
appreciation 
for 
your positive 
response 
for 
funding 
the 
Malawi 
Social 
Action 
Fund 
Phase 
111, 
the 
appraisal 
of 
which 
has 
just 
been 
finalized. 
2. 
As 
the Government 
indicated 
in 
the 
MASAF 
III 
Concept Document, 
the 
country 
continues 
-to 
face 
significant 
challenges 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
essential 
services 
to 
the 
poor. 
Poverty 
is 
widespread, deep 
and 
severe 
in 
Malawi 
especially 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
According 
to 
the 
1998 
Integrated 
Household 
Survey, 65.3% 
(roughly 
6.3 
million) 
of 
the 
population 
is 
poor, and 
about 
28.7% 
of 
the 
population lives 
in 
abject 
poverty. 
The 
level 
of 
inequality 
is 
well 
illustrated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
richest 
20% 
of 
the 
population 
consume 
46.3% 
while 
the 
poorest 
20% 
utilize only 
6.3% 
of 
the 
total 
goods 
and 
services. 
Consumption 
is 
unequally distributed 
between 
the 
rural 
and 
urban 
dwellers. 
People 
in 
urban 
areas 
consume 
40 
percent 
more 
than 
those 
in 
rural 
areas. 
3. 
The 
major 
causes 
of 
poverty include 
limited 
access 
to 
land, 
low 
education, 
poor 
health 
status, 
limited 
off 
farm 
employment and 
a 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
credit. Sectoral 
analysis 
of 
poverty 
shows 
that 
social, 
human capital 
and 
income 
indicators 
are 
very 
- 
59 
- 
Page  64
poor. 
In 
1998, 
poverty 
indicators 
showed that about 
52 
percent 
of 
the 
poor 
belonged 
to 
female-headed 
households thereby 
exerting 
more 
economic 
pressure 
to 
poor 
women. 
The 
literacy 
rate 
was 
as 
low 
as 
58%, 
where 
female 
literacy 
was 
44%. 
Education 
attainment, 
defined, 
as 
completion 
of 
standard 
8, 
was 
only 
1 
1.2% 
for 
adults aged 
25 
years 
and 
above, 
and 
only 
6.2% 
for 
women. 
The 
national 
gross 
enrolment 
ratio 
was 
estimated 
at 
132 
and 
the 
pupil 
to 
qualified 
teacher 
ratio 
was 
114, 
leading 
to 
over 
crowding 
in 
schools 
and 
subsequently 
lower 
quality 
of 
education. 
4. 
In 
terms 
of 
health 
indicators, 
life 
expectancy at 
birth 
has 
dropped 
from 
43 years 
in 
1996 
to 39 
years 
in 
2000. 
In 
2000, 
infant 
and 
under-five 
mortality 
rates 
were 
estimated 
to 
be 
104 
and 
1 
89.deaths 
per 
1000 
live 
births, 
respectively. 
The 
maternal 
mortality 
rate 
in 
2000 
was 
1,120 
deaths 
per 
100,000 
live 
births, 
a 
rise 
from 
620 
in 
1990. 
5. 
The 
1998 
Integrated 
Household 
Survey demonstrated that 
subsistence 
agriculture 
remained 
the 
main 
source 
of 
income 
for 
the 
rural 
poor. 
The major 
source 
of 
cash 
income 
for Malawian 
households 
was wage 
income, 
which 
contributed 
about 
13 
.O% 
of 
income 
for 
the 
rural 
poor. However, 
there was 
limited 
participation 
in 
the 
cash 
economy 
by 
the 
poor. 
As 
if 
this 
is 
not 
enough, 
the 
high 
levels 
of 
HIV/AIDs 
prevalence compounds 
the 
already 
worsening situation 
leading 
to 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
dependants. 
6. 
MASAF 
I 
and 
11, 
and 
other 
Government 
initiatives 
tried 
to 
address 
some 
of 
the 
socio-economic 
problems through 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Poverty 
Alleviation 
Programme 
(PAP), 
launched 
in 
1994, 
when 
Government, made 
poverty alleviation 
(now 
poverty 
reduction) 
its 
policy 
agenda 
for 
national 
development. 
The 
Policy 
Framework 
for 
Poverty 
Alleviation 
(PFPAP) was 
published 
in 
1995 
with 
a 
vision 
for 
every 
Malawian 
to 
have 
access 
to 
basic 
necessities 
and 
exploit 
hislher 
potential 
to 
lead 
a 
productive, 
dignified 
and 
creative 
life 
through 
social, 
economic 
and 
political 
empowerment. 
Currently, 
the 
demand 
for 
social-economic 
services 
is 
still 
overwhelming 
due 
to 
the 
increased 
levels 
of 
poverty. 
7. 
Let 
me 
mention 
Mr. 
Vice 
President 
that 
the 
consultative 
process 
in 
designing 
MASA1" 
I11 
Programme 
has 
been 
long 
and 
rigorous. 
The 
reasons 
are: 
(a) 
the 
design 
of 
the 
new 
MASAF 
is 
taking 
place 
at a 
time 
when 
there 
are 
fundamental 
changes 
in 
the 
policy 
and institutional 
frameworks 
for 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
in 
Malawi 
and 
(b) 
there 
is 
need 
to widen 
and 
deepen 
the 
MASAF 
scope 
as 
demanded 
by 
the 
key 
stakeholders. 
Key 
policy 
issues 
at 
the 
center 
of 
Government 
planning 
at 
the 
moment 
are 
the 
Malawi 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy, 
Medium 
Term 
Expenditure 
Framework, and 
the 
Decentralization 
policy 
implementation. 
The 
Malawi 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
8. 
In 
2002 
the 
Government 
developed 
the 
Malawi 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
which 
is 
an overarching 
statement 
representing a 
consensus 
about 
how Malawi 
can 
achieve 
its 
core 
objective 
of 
poverty 
reduction. The 
underlying philosophy 
of 
the 
MPRS 
is 
empowerment 
of 
communities and 
individuals 
so 
that 
they 
are 
able 
to 
own 
the development 
process. 
"The 
MPRS 
will 
be 
implemented 
through 
the 
budget 
process 
known 
as 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Expenditure 
Framework 
(MTEF). 
MPRS 
as 
a 
national 
planning 
tool 
outlines an affordable 
strategy 
for 
reducing poverty 
to 
be 
- 
60 
- 
Page  65
implemented 
using 
the 
MTEF 
as 
a planning, 
budgeting 
and 
public 
expenditure 
monitoring 
tool. 
9. 
The 
MPRS 
is 
built 
around 
four pillars. 
These 
pillars 
are 
the 
main 
strategic 
components 
grouping 
the various 
activities and 
policies 
into 
coherent 
framework 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
first 
pillar 
promotes 
rapid 
sustainable 
pro-poor 
economic 
growth 
and structural 
transformation. 
The 
second 
pillar 
is 
about enhancing 
human 
capital 
development. 
The 
third 
pillar 
improves 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
the 
most 
vulnerable. 
The fourth 
promotes good 
governance. 
The 
MPRS 
also mainstreams 
key 
cross 
cutting 
issues 
such 
as 
HIV/AIDS, 
gender, 
environment,  and 
science 
and 
technology. 
MASAF 
is 
seen 
as 
a 
major 
tool for 
the 
realization 
of 
the

Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs) 
10. 
Malawi 
also 
recognizes 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
(MDGs) 
upon 
which 
the 
Malawi 
Poverty 
Reduction 
strategy 
is 
hinged. 
The 
MDGs 
are 
centered 
on 
eradicating 
poverty 
and 
hunger; 
achieving 
universal 
primary 
education; 
promoting 
gender 
equality 
and 
empower 
women; 
reducing 
child 
mortality; 
improving 
maternal 
health; 
combating 
HIV/AIDs, 
malaria and 
other 
diseases; 
ensuring 
environmental 
sustainability; 
and 
developing 
a 
global 
partnership 
for 
development.

1. 
According 
to 
Malawi 
the 
six 
refined 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
are: 
income 
poverty 
(Pro-Poor 
Growth); 
access 
to 
potable 
water, 
completion 
of 
a 
full 
course 
of 
primary 
school; 
under-five 
mortality; 
maternal 
mortality, 
and 
HIV/AIDs 
incidence. 
A 
brief 
review 
of 
the 
current 
situation 
for 
some selected 
MDG 
targets 
shows 
that 
for 
poverty, 
the 
MDG 
target 
for 
20 
15 
is 
to 
have 
poverty 
incidence 
of 
32.7%; 
for 
access 
to 
safe 
water 
the 
target 
is 
to 
increase 
access 
from 
52 
percent 
to 
78 
percent 
by 
201 
5; 
for 
universal 
primary, 
the target 
is 
to 
have zero percent 
of 
drop-outs; 
for 
Under-Five 
Mortality 
the 
target 
is 
to 
reduce 
mortality 
by 
50 
percent 
by 
2015 (reduce 
to 
117 deaths 
per 
1000 
live 
births 
by 
the year 
2015); 
for 
maternal 
mortality, 
the target 
is 
reduce the rate 
by 
seventy 
five 
percent 
by 
2015; 
and 
for 
HIV/AIDs 
incidence 
the 
target 
is 
to 
halt 
any 
new 
infections and 
starting 
reducing 
the 
prevalence 
by 
20 
15. 
12. 
Of 
the 
five 
MDGs, 
only 
two 
(increasing 
access 
to 
portable 
water and 
reducing 
under-five 
mortality) 
can 
be 
viewed 
as 
achievable 
with 
minimum 
changes 
in 
policy 
and 
increases 
in 
resource 
allocation. 
Reducing 
maternal 
mortality 
and 
income 
poverty 
are 
the 
most 
difficult 
MDGs 
for 
the 
country to 
achieve. 
The 
slow 
behaviour 
change 
is 
also 
making 
the 
immediate 
reduction 
in 
HIV 
infection 
difficult to 
attain. 
In 
general, 
the 
six 
MDGs 
are 
achievable 
only 
with 
radical 
changes 
in 
policies, 
attitudes, 
mindsets, 
and 
political 
and technical commitment. 
Decentralization 
13. 
You 
may 
also 
note 
Mr. 
Vice 
President 
that Government 
adopted 
the 
Decentralization 
Policy 
in 
1998 
by 
adopting 
the 
new 
Local 
Government 
Act. 
The 
policy 
seeks 
to 
(a) 
devolve administration and 
political 
authority 
to 
the 
district 
level; 
(b) 
integrate Governmental 
agencies 
at 
the 
district and 
local 
level 
into 
one 
administrative 
unit, 
through 
the 
process 
of 
institutional 
integration, manpower 
absorption, 
composite 
budgeting 
and 
provision 
of 
funds 
for 
the 
decentralized 
services; (c) 
divert 
the 
center 
of 
implementation responsibilities 
and transfers 
these 
to 
the 
districts; 
(d) 
assign, 
functions 
and 
responsibilities 
to 
the 
various levels 
of 
-

Page  66
Government; and 
(e) 
promote popular 
participation 
in 
the 
governance and 
development 
of 
districts. 
14. 
The 
objectives 
of 
the 
policy 
are: (a) 
to 
create 
a democratic 
environment and 
institutions 
in 
Malawi 
for 
governance 
and 
development; 
at 
the 
local 
level 
which 
will 
facilitate 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
grassroots 
in 
decision making; 
(b) 
to 
eliminate 
dual 
administration, 
field 
administration 
and 
local 
Government 
at 
the 
district 
level 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
making 
public 
service 
more efficient, more 
economical and 
cost 
effective; 
(c) 
to 
promote accountability 
and good 
governance 
to 
the 
local 
level 
in 
order 
to help 
Government reduce 
poverty; and 
(d) 
to 
mobilize 
the 
masses 
for 
socio-economic development at 
the 
local 
level. The 
rationale 
for 
Decentralization 
is 
to 
abolish 
a 
dual 
system; 
Improvement 
of 
Coordination; Promote popular 
participation; 
and 
ultimately 
reduce 
Poverty. 
The 
Rationale 
for 
MASAF 
I11 
15. 
Mr. 
Vice 
President, despite several 
Government 
initiatives 
in 
social 
investment, 
poverty 
is 
still 
rampant. 
The 
state 
of 
affairs 
as 
described 
in 
the 
MPRS 
calls 
for 
action 
to 
enable 
people over-come constraints 
to 
their 
development 
and 
to 
foster 
broad-based 
growth. 
It 
is 
apparent 
that past 
reliance 
on 
top-down 
growth 
strategies, 
did 
not 
lay 
sufficient 
emphasis 
on 
strengthening 
the 
human 
resources 
capital 
and 
economic empowerment. 
MASAF 
will 
aim 
at 
strengthening 
local 
governance, 
foster 
accountability 
and 
enhance 
community participation 
in 
decision-making 
and 
management 
of 
the development 
process. 
16. 
A 
number 
of 
development programmes 
are 
being 
implemented 
in 
the 
sectors 
of 
education, 
health, water 
and 
sanitation, 
food 
security, 
and 
nutrition. 
However, 
the 
gap 
between 
the 
national 
requirements 
and 
what 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
accomplished even 
if 
all 
the 
programmes were successfully 
implemented 
would 
still 
be 
huge. 
This 
explains 
why 
the 
demand 
for 
project 
funding 
from 
the 
community 
under 
the 
MASAF 
project 
far 
exceeds 
expectations 
and 
resources 
available. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the demand 
momentum under 
the 
new 
MASAF 
programme 
will 
continue 
until 
the 
communities 
prioritized 
needs 
are 
fully 
addressed. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
June 
2001, 
over 
10,000 
subproject 
applications 
had 
been 
received 
estimated 
at 
more than 
US$585 
million. 
Due 
to financial 
constraints, 
MASAF 
has 
not 
been 
able 
to 
meet 
this 
demand. 
The coming 
in 
of 
the 
elected members 
of 
the 
District 
Assemblies, 
who 
are 
also 
facilitating 
development 
activities, 
has 
further 
exacerbated 
the demand 
for 
financial 
assistance. 
In 
addition, 
there has 
been 
increased 
awareness 
of 
MASAF 
principles 
and 
eligibility 
requirements 
overtime 
due 
to 
effective communication 
strategies 
and 
visible 
results 
on 
the ground. 
17. 
Government constituted 
the 
Programme 
Preparation 
Team 
comprising 
officials 
from 
Office 
of 
the President 
and 
Cabinet, 
Local 
Government 
and 
District 
Administration, 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
Depaitinent 
of 
Economic Planning 
and 
Development, 
Ministry 
of 
Justice 
and 
MASAF 
to 
design 
another 
phase 
of 
MASAF. 
The 
team 
through 
the 
consultative 
process 
that includes 
interaction 
with 
communities, 
Local 
Assemblies, 
civil 
society 
organizations, 
the 
private 
sector, 
other 
Government 
institutions and 
departments 
and 
donors 
produced 
a 
Concept 
document 
in 
February 
2002.

Community Empowerment 
and 
Development 
Project 
(CEDP) 
within 
MASAF 
I11 
18. 
Through 
the 
Proposed 
MASAF 
I11 
Programme, 
Government 
will 
consolidate 
and entrench 
the 
development 
approach, 
which 
has 
been 
followed 
under 
the 
previous 
MASAF 
Project. 
The 
experiences 
gained 
in 
the 
past show that 
the 
communities 
are 
able 
to 
prepare 
and 
manage 
projects 
suitable 
for 
their 
needs. 
Further 
more, 
the 
pace 
of 
implementation 
has demonstrated 
that 
community 
driven 
participatory 
approaches 
have 
tremendous advantage 
over 
the 
convention 
top-down 
approach 
in 
terms 
of 
timeliness, 
cost 
effectiveness 
sustainability 
and 
ownership 
of 
assets 
created. 
19. 
Under 
MASAF 
111, 
the 
distributed 
nodes 
of 
social 
capital 
generated 
through 
MASAF 
I 
and 
I1 
will 
be 
networked to 
both 
optimize 
the 
social 
capital 
generated 
as 
well 
as 
to 
facilitate 
its 
incremental conversion 
into 
economic capital. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
through 
a three-phase 
Community 
Empowerment and Development 
Program 
(CEDP), 
which 
will 
strengthen 
the 
decentralization 
process 
by 
making 
community 
empowerment 
an 
integral 
part 
of district 
service 
delivery 
process 
over 
a 
twelve 
(1 
2) 
year 
period. 
The 
CEDP 
leverages 
the comparative 
advantages 
of 
social 
funds 
in 
empowering communities 
by 
addressing 
decentralization 
challenges 
between communities 
and 
District 
Assemblies, 
but 
recognizes 
that 
it 
can 
be 
better 
aligned 
with 
decentralization 
of 
Central Government 
to 
Local 
Authorities. 
20. 
MASAF 
I11 
will 
remain 
a 
funding 
organization 
for 
sub-projects 
through 
the 
operational 
components 
of 
(a) 
Community 
Development 
Programme that 
will 
combine 
community 
managed 
and 
district 
managed projects; 
(b) 
Sponsored 
Sub-projects;  (c) 
Community 
Savings 
and Investment 
Promotion 
and 
(c) 
Development 
Accountability 
Programme. 
In 
addition 
there 
will 
be 
an 
Institutional 
Development 
component 
to 
support 
the 
operational 
components 
with 
respect 
to 
financial 
and 
human 
resource 
management. 
21. 
Under 
the 
Adjustable 
Program 
Loan 
(APL) 
arrangement 
MASAF 
I11 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
three 
phases, 
the 
transition 
of 
which 
will 
be determined 
by 
pre-defined 
triggers. 
These 
will 
continuously 
be 
assessed 
to 
monitor 
their 
capacity 
in 
project 
management, 
and 
implementation. 
The 
lessons 
learned 
from 
each phase 
will 
feed 
into 
the 
strategies 
and 
approaches 
in 
the 
successor 
phase 
- 
resulting 
in 
adjustments, 
refinements 
and 
redesigns. 
To 
achieve 
integrated 
and 
sustainable 
project 
outcomes, 
this 
phasing 
of 
the 
API, 
has 
been 
synchronized 
with 
the 
Medium-Term 
Expenditure 
Framework 
(MTEF) 
for 
implementing 
the 
MPRSP 
and 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy (CAS). 
22. 
While 
the 
MTEF 
and 
CAS 
are 
in 
three-year cycles, 
MASAF 
III 
APLs 
will 
be 
designed 
in 
a 
manner that 
ensures 
that 
resources 
are 
continuously 
available 
to 
communities,  CBOs, 
and 
Local 
Authorities 
(LAs). 
Furthermore, 
LAs 
who 
fully 
take 
over 
MASAF 
I11 
resource management 
will 
receive 
all 
MTEF 
resources 
needed 
to 
finance 
community 
service 
packages (once 
these 
are 
coasted 
during 
APL 
I). 
The 
majority 
of 
triggers 
for 
the 
APL,s 
arc 
based 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
Districts to 
take 
over 
major 
MASAF 
functions 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
management 
of 
resources, 
service 
delivery, 
and 
reporting 
on 
outcomes 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
CAS, 
MPRSP, 
Decentralization 
and 
MDGs.

23. 
You 
may 
note 
Mr. 
Vice 
President 
that 
through 
the 
consultative 
process 
of 
designing 
MASAF 
111 
stakeholders expressed 
a 
strong 
desire 
for 
MASAF 
to 
have a 
legal 
status 
of 
its 
own. 
This 
will 
be 
considered 
during 
the 
later 
APL 
phases 
of 
the 
Programme 
as 
it 
transform 
into 
a 
knowledge and 
learning 
institution 
for 
Community 
Driven 
Development. 
24. 
The 
major 
challenge 
for 
the 
MASAF 
I11 
is 
the 
integration 
of 
its 
functions 
into 
the 
District 
Planning 
System 
amidst uncertainties 
in 
district 
capacities 
at 
a 
time 
when 
devolution 
of 
sectoral 
functions 
is 
still 
underway. 
In 
addition, 
the 
District 
Assemblies 
will 
be 
entrusted 
with 
a 
responsibility 
of 
tracking 
the 
MDG 
indicators. 
This 
calls 
for 
more efforts 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
capacity 
building 
hence 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
specific Development 
Accountability 
Component 
in 
MASAF. 
In 
addition, 
MASAF 
111 
will 
initiate 
the 
institutionalization 
of 
Participatory Community 
Monitoring 
and 
Accountability, 
to 
allow 
communities realize 
their 
entitlements 
and 
demand 
accountability 
from 
those 
in 
authority and 
service 
providers. 
25. 
I 
would 
also 
like 
to 
register 
Government's 
commitment 
in 
implementing 
pro-poor 
initiatives 
such 
as 
MASAF. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Government 
will 
provide 
the 
required 
counterpart 
funding 
for 
MASAF 
I11 
upfront. The 
funds 
will 
be 
released 
to 
the 
Office 
of 
the President 
and 
Cabinet 
(OPC) 
and 
will 
be 
reflected 
in 
the 
development 
budget. 
The 
Government 
clearly 
demonstrates 
here that 
it 
fully 
owns 
the 
MASAF 
Programme.  Government 
will 
also 
make 
available 
to 
MASAF 
some 
funds 
to 
support 
safety 
nets operations 
in 
the 
Community 
Development 
Programme 
Component.  Once 
again, 
Government 
will 
remain committed 
in 
implementing 
the 
MASAF 
111 
programme.

under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
explained 
to 
communities 
during 
the 
PRA 
stages 
(both 
open and 
extended) 
so 
that 
communities 
can 
(a) assess 
their 
service

against 
the

standards, 
and 
(b) 
set

It 
is 
possible 
that 
a

to 
reach the

will 
publicize 
Local

using 
results 
from 
annual performance

will 
be 
used 
during

to 
assess 
the

in 
the 
context 
of

(a) 
communities 
requesting

will 
work 
their 
way 
up 
the

12 
MDG

been 
able

to provide

Design 
of 
the

is 
in 
support 
of

will 
be allocated 
to

Phase 
I) 
and 
LAs 
(in 
the 
following 
Phases) 
in 
line 
with 
the

cycle. 
The

comprising 
50%

available 
poverty 
and 
service 
related 
indicators. 
The 
indicators 
selected 
relate 
to 
the 
12 
MDGs 
which 
are 
being 
monitored 
under 
MASAF 
3. 
Annual 
reviews 
will 
be 
undertaken 
to 
assess 
utilization 
of 
the 
funds, 
and 
the 
status 
of 
the 
indicators, and 
adjustments 
will 
be 
made 
to 
the 
IPF 
annually. 
Targeted 
capacity 
building 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
LAs 
if 
deemed necessary 
to 
improve 
performance. 
The 
indicators 
used 
to 
arrive 
at 
the 
IPF 
by 
LA, 
including 
their 
respective 
weights 
are 
given 
in 
Table 
1. 
LAs 
will 
undertake 
open-ended 
PUS 
in

which 
have 
the 
furthest 
to 
go 
in 
attaining 
the 
12 
MDGs 
being 
tracked 
under 
MASAF 
3; 
this 
will 
generate 
a 
list 
of 
community priorities 
which 
will 
feed 
into 
the 
LA 
plans. 
If 
the 
priorities 
include activities 
that 
qualify 
for 
MASAF 
support 
then 
extended 
PRAs 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
LAs.

Methodology: 
MASAF 
has 
used a 
very simple methodology 
to 
allocate 
the 
IPFs, 
which 
can 
be 
easily 
revised 
and 
replicated. 
Districts 
are 
ranked 
for 
each 
of 
the 
indicators 
(from 
worst 
to 
best) 
and 
are 
then 
weighted 
(by 
their 
respective 
weights) 
and 
summed 
up 
to 
produce 
a 
composite 
district 
rank, 
ranging 
from 
the 
most 
deprived 
(1) 
to 
the 
least 
deprived 
(27). 
The 
per 
capita 
resource 
allocation 
has 
been 
adjusted 
so 
that the 
worst-off 
districts 
get 
more than 
their 
share 
while 
the 
better-off 
ones 
get 
less 
than 
their 
share. 
The 
adjustment 
factor 
ranges 
from 
+20% 
to 
-20% 
for 
CMPs 
and 
SSPs, 
and 
from 
+40% 
to 
-40% 
for 
LAMPS.
