APPRAISAL OF
THE REHABILITATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        The Suez Canal has been closed since July 1967 as a result of hos-
tilities in the Middle East. With disengagement, the Egyptian Government
has given first priority to reopening and rehabilitating the Canal. During
hostilities mines and explosives were lodged in the channel, and most serv-
ice and operational equipment was damaged or destroyed. Clearance of mines
and explosives was carried out by naval personnel (Egyptian, French, UK, USSR
and US) and is nearly completed so that the Canal can be reopened to traffic
by the end of the first quarter of 1975. The Government has requested Bank
assistance for rehabilitation, which will begin in the fall of 1974 and pro-
ceed until the end of 1977.
ii.       The project will be the third Bank Group involvement in transport
and the second for the Suez Canal. Under the project, equipment and mate-
rial will be procured, and damaged or destroyed infrastructure and buildings
will be rehabilitated. Technical assistance ard studies also will be provided
to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) to improve planning and operations, to set
dues, and to evaluate the optimum size and timing of future canal expansion.
iii.      The project cost is estimated at US$288 million.  This excludes
naval contributions to canal preparations and interest during construction
on external loans. But it includes customs duties, costs of shipping and
handling, and fees for local agents, insurance companies, local fittings,
and trials. The foreign exchange cost of the project is US$181 million,
or 63%. Costs of the civil works have been derived largely from prices
of similar works now being undertaken in the Canal Zone, and are reasonable.
They are based on SCA using a high percentage of its labor force. Costs of
equipment are based on recent suppliers' prices.
iv.       A Bank loan to SCA of US$50 million is proposed for a 20-year term,
including 4 years of grace, to cover 27.6% of the foreign exchange cost of
the project. SCA has already obtained a US$33 million loan from the Kuwait
Fund for Arab Economic Development and is negotiating for an additional loan
of US$33 million. USAID has indicated that it intends, subject to congres-
sional approval to contribute US$50 million towards the financing of the
project and SCA and the Government are negotiating with other potential
lenders another US$15 million to cover the foreign exchange cost of the
project. The Government and SCA will finance the local cost. Retroactive
financing up to US$3.5 million is recommended to cover expenditures by SCA
after July 1, 1974 on urgently needed items proposed to be financed by the
Bank.
v.        SCA will be responsible for carrying out the project, and its staff
is competent to do so. The Bank-financed items will be procured based on in-
ternational competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group "Guidelines



- ii -
for Procurement", with the exception of spare parts amounting to about US$4.3
million. SCA has a competent procurement department, which will prepare tender
documents. Contracts will be grouped so as to attract foreign bidders. Local
preferences to the extent of 15% of the CIF landed price of imported goods or
the actual customs duty, whichever is lower, will apply to local bids.
The construction period will be from the fall of 1974 to the end of 1977, but
ships will be able to transit the Canal, possibly at reduced speed, from
reopening.
vi.       SCA intends to revise canal dues before reopening, and consultants
were selected in July 1974 to study future traffic and recommend possible
levels of dues. The financial evaluation was based on dues 37% higher than
in 1967 and shows that SCA will be able to service its debt, contribute LE
30.8 million to the project, and retain a reasonable cash balance at the end
of 1980. SCA has carried on its books at a nominal value of LE 1 fixed assets
taken over upon nationalization in 1956; it has not been able to carry out a
complete inventory of damages to assets resulting from hostilities. Revalua-
tion of assets is essential and will be undertaken as part of the project.
The audit of SCA's accounts by Government auditors is satisfactory and ac-
ceptable to the Bank.
vii.      Reopening will greatly reduce the sea distance on a number of major
trade routes and will generate savings in shipping costs of US$315 million in
1975 and US$1,250 million in 1980. The main beneficiaries will be SCA, ship
owners, and shippers. Subsequently, Egypt will recoup part of the benefits
through canal dues. Based on the 1967 tariffs increased by 37%, the project
will yield a rate of return exceeding 50%.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$50 million to the
Suez Canal Authority for a 20-year term, corresponding to the average life
of the assets, including 4 years of grace, corresponding to the expected
disbursement period.



APPRAISAL OF
THE REHABILITATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      As a result of hostilities in the Middle East, the Suez Canal has
been closed since 1967. With disengagement, the Egyptian Government has
given first priority to reopening and rehabilitating the Canal. The Egyptian,
French, US akLd UK Navies have almost completed removing mines and explosives,
and removal of wrecks and other obstacles is well underway. The Canal is ex-
pected to be clear by the end of 1974, and reopened to traffic by the end of
the first quarter of 1975.
1.02      Most service infrastructure and operational equipment for the Canal
was damaged or destroyed during hostilities, and must be rehabilitated to per-
mit ships to transit. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has prepared a project
for this purpose, and the Egyptian Government has requested financial assis-
tance from the Bank. A Bank mission visited Egypt in April 1974 to appraise
the project.
1.03      Rehabilitation is expected to cost US$288 million, including a for-
eign exchange cost of US$181 million. To help finance the foreign exchange
cost, a US$50 million Bank loan to SCA is proposed. The balance would be fi-
nanced by a US$33 million loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Devel-
opment, and by borrowings of US$98 million from other sources (USAID, other
Arab and external sources). The Government will finance local currency cost
until SCA resumes earning sufficient revenue.
1.04      Other Bank Group involvement in transport includes a Bank loan of
US$56.5 million (243-UAR, December 1959) to SCA and an IDA credit of US$30
million (284-UAR, February 1972) for a Railway Project. A second Railway
Project was appraised recently.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of the April 1974 appraisal
mission composed of Messrs. P.C. de Man (Division Chief), P. Bourcier (Econ-
omist), A.J. Carmichael (Ports, Shipping, Aviation, and Pipelines Adviser),
and A.H. Clark (Financial Analyst) of the Bank, as well as Messrs. K. Strong
of Hu Harries and Associates (Canada) and I. Englestadt of SC Shipping Con-
sultants (Norway). Mrs. P. Valad (Editor) assisted in preparation of the
report.

II. THE SUEZ CANAL
A. General
2.01      A navigable waterway connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas was
originally considered 40 centuries ago. The first canal was built in 2,000
B.C. joining the Nile River and Bitter Lake, which then opened into the Red
Sea. The present Suez Canal was built between 1859 and 1869. Its length is
160 km and its permissible draft is 11.60 m, having been increased from the
original 6.76 m. The Canal shortens the sea voyage between Western Europe
and Asia by about 5,000 nautical mi. It was one of the most important water-
ways for international traffic until closure in 1967 as the result of hostili-
ties in the Middle East.
2.02      The Compagnie Maritime Universelle du Canal de Suez operated the
Canal until July 26, 1956, when it was nationalized. In 1957, the Government
set up SCA, an autonomous legal entity, to be in charge of canal operations.
The first task of SCA was to clear the Canal of sunken vessels. The United
Nations provided assistance for this operation, and costs were recouped through
a surcharge imposed on ships. In addition, the Bank provided a US$56.5 million
loan (243-UAR, December 1959), to: widen and deepen the Canal; improve Port
Said operations; and supply floating equipment to replace obsolete equipment
and to meet future requirements. The project was carried out satisfactorily,
and, despite closure in 1967 the loan was repaid on schedule.
2.03      Traffic through the Canal expressed in Suez Canal Net Registered
Ton (SCNRT) (para 5.02) grew between the end of World War II and 1967 at an
average annual rate of 12%, while the number of ships passages grew at 5%,
reflecting the use of larger ships. Although traffic decreased slightly im-
mediately after nationalization, it recovered quickly when confidence was
established in the new SCA. The Canal became the principal route by which
Middle East petroleum was transported to markets in Europe and the Western
Hemisphere.  In 1966, 36% of petroleum loaded in the Middle East and 14% of
world seaborne traffic passed through the Canal. Dry cargo represented only
5% of the combined loadings and unloadings of European and American ports,
but 41% of loadings and unloadings of Persian Gulf ports, 32% of Red Sea and
African ports, and 24% of South and Southeast Asian ports. 1/
2.04      Canal operations under SCA were efficient and uninterrupted from
1956 to closure in 1967. SCA became the second largest foreign exchange
earner after cotton. Proceeds from canal operations accrued directly to
the Egyptian Government as royalties and taxes paid by SCA and as transfers
of profits. Foreign exchange transfers from SCA to the Government grew from
1/   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, "The Economic Effects
of the Closure of the Suez Canal", New York, 1973.



- 3 -
US$15.5 million in 1957 to US$195.5 million in 1967, the last full year of
operation (Annex 1). In addition, the Canal generated service activities
in the Canal Zone and provided most of the income of the three cities in the
Zone (Ismaelia, Port Said, and Suez).
B. Past Traffic
2.05      Until World War II, dry cargo accounted for abou t 75% of canal traf--
fic. This situation changed, however, in the late 1940's/early 1950's when
petroleum traffic from the Middle East to Europe started to exceed dry cargo
traffic (Annex 2). From 1955 to 1966, petroleum and dry cargo traffic grew
at an average annual rate of 8.5%, with petroleum traffic growing at 10% and
dry cargo at 5.8%. Petroleum products accounted for 63% of total tonnage
in 1955 and 73% in 1966. The direction of trade was strongly imbalanced in
terms of tonnage niorthbound, but was more balanced in terms of numbers of
passages northbound and southbound. tMost nortlhbound traffic consisted of
petroleum as well as agricultural products and raw materials from South and
Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Middle East while southbound traffic con-
sisted principally of cereals from North America and manufactured goods from
Europe transported by conventional liners on fixed routes. Passenger traffic
was important before and immediately after World tJar II, but was almost non-
existent by 1967 due to the competition of air travel.
2.06      During 1966, 99% of the petroleum passing through the Canal came
from the Middle East, of which 93% went to Europe (Annex 3), 6% to £4orth
America, and 1% to Africa. Wlhile the average number of tankers passing
through the Canal from 1962 to 1966 did not vary by more than 5.5,', the
size distribution changed considerably. In 1964 tankers of over 50,000
dwt carried only 16% of petroleum traffic, but by 1966 they carried more
than 40%. These changes reflected the world trend toward large tankers.
The first tanker of over 100,000 dwt was built in 1965, and for the first
time the permissible draft of the Canal became an obstacle to future traffic
development.
2.07      SCA was aware of developments in tanker size, and had prepared an
expansion program, the first phase of wlhich would have brought the permissible
canal draft to 14.60 m in 1972, enabling tankers of up to 200,000 dwt to pass
in ballast and tankers of up to 125,000 dwt laden. Tenders for this stage had
been received on June 5, 1967, the day hostilities broke out and the Canal was
closed. It is the intention of SCA to proceed with the enlargement of the
Canal as soon as the waterway is cleared. To that effect a letter of intent
was given to a Japanese contractor to start dredging by mid-1975. In the
meanwhile, .CA has decided to carry out a study of the optimum size and tilmling
of the expansion and is in the process of selecting consultants. This study
will be financed by the Bank loan (para 4.24), terms of reterence have been
reviewed by the bank and are satisfactory.  l)uring loan negotiations,  iCA and
thie Government agreed to afford the bank an adequate opportunity to cotmment
on the results of the study before deciding on the optimum dimensions and
phasing of the enlargement (para 4.24).



-4-
C. Consequences of Closure of the Canal
2.08      Closure of the Canal lengthened many important trade routes, creat-
ing a shortage in the supply of ships for petroleum as well as dry cargo.
In the short run, this affected a number of countries, as deliveries of
goods were delayed, transport costs were increased, and alternative routes
were required. For petroleum, the effect was limited to temporary shortages
in Europe and substantial increases in freight costs reflecting longer dis-
tances. But for dry cargo, the effect was more complex. Shipping lines
and conferences imposed a "special closure surcharge" (Annex 4) applicable
to all commodities, which on average was 25% of prevailing tariffs. This
surcharge still exists. Similarly, dry bulk shipping rates increased due
to closure reflecting longer distances, higher costs of bunkering, and tight
supply of ships. The UN Report (para 2.03) estimates that from 1967 to 1971
shipping cost increases resulting from closure of the Canal were US$4,355
million, of which US$2,860 million were for tanker shipping and US$1,495
million for dry cargo shipping (Annex 5).
2.09      Individual countries have felt the effects of closure of the Canal,
with some having a marked decline in port traffic and otlhers having a marked
increase, necessitating improvement and expansion of port facilities to cope
with diverted traffic. Egypt has lost the foreign exchange earnings from
canal dues and some countries have experienced a temporary decline in ex-
ports of products which could not support higher transport costs. The main
areas affected by closure were Southeast Asia and East Africa. The UN Report
estimates net losses from 1968 to 1970 at about US$563 mLillion.
2.10      Closure of the Canal changed the shipping industry.  Reacting rapidly,
the petroleum shipping industry caused additional tanker capacity to be built
in the prospect of sustained high freight rates, and the number of very large
crude carriers increased substantially. Tankers of over 125,000 ton accounted
in 1966 for less than 1.5% of total fleet capacity, but in 1973 for more than
45%; most tankers built since closure are unable to use the Canal fully laden
at its preclosure draft. In addition, a number of projects were prepared to
provide alternative routes to Europe for Middle East petroleum. Among them
are the Suez-Mediterranean (SUMED) Pipeline from Suez to Alexandria in Egypt,
expected to be completed by 1976-77 and to have an initial annual capacity
of 80 million ton, and the Eilat-Ashkalon Pipeline in Israel, operating with
an annual capacity of 20 million ton. Technological developments regarding
dry cargo were somewhat less spectacular. Specialized larger ships were
built (bulk ore carriers and container ships), and most are able to use the
Canal at its preclosure draft either in ballast or fully laden.
D.  ])amage to the Canal
2.11      Between 1967 and 1973, the Canal was the demarcation line between
Egyptian and Israeli armed forces. Fortifications were built on its banks.
Continuous artillery duels caused damage to the Canal, although its main



structures were unharmed, and to Ismaelia, Port Said, and Suez. The chan-
nel was mined, and many unexploded shells or bombs were lodged in it.
2.12      Most damage occurred in the southern part of the Canal Zone.  Suez
was almost entirely destroyed--most SCA facilities were heavily damaged and
almost all floating equipment was sunk. Ismaelia was less seriously damaged,
although the water supply plant was harmed and most of SCA's buildings were
shelled. Port Said was lightly damaged and Port Fouad's shipyard was seriously
damaged. Much of SCA's equipment in Ismaelia and Port Said was evacuated
safely, but it now is obsolete because of lack of replacement.
E. Present Situationi
2.13      Due to closure since 1967, the Canal has lost some importance, par-
ticularly for seaborne petroleum trade. However, it still has a large poten-
tial for tankers up to 150,000 dwt returning in ballast and for dry cargo
vessels (Chapter VII and Annexes 6 and 7). Since disengagement in the Middle
East has made reopening possible, the Egyptian Government has undertaken to
do so, and has given first priority to the project.
2.14      The Government has also decided to construct the SUMED pipeline
(para 2.10). The pipeline will not compete directly with the reopened Canal;
however, it could provide an alternative to expansion of the Canal (paras 2.07
and 4.22). So far, the SUMED Company and SCA have done little to coordinate
their development plans. The Government agreed to take all necessary actions
to ensure proper coordination between the respective development plans of SCA
and of the SUMED Company.
2.15      Since April 1974 the Egyptian, US, French, USSR, and UK Navies have
been removing mines and explosives from the canal bed. This removal of mines
is almost completed and the removal of wrecks and other obstacles is progress-
ing satisfactorily. Meanwhile SCA personnel has started to salvage minor wrecks
and to clear facilities at Ismaelia, Port Said, and Suez. Damaged or destroyed
floating and fixed equipment (para 2.12) needs to be replaced if the Canal
is to be reopened to traffic and to be operated at its 1967 efficiency. SCA
has already obtained a loan of US$33 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development, and is negotiating for an additional loan of US$33 mil-
lion. USAID has indicated that it intends, subject to congressional approval,
to contribute US$50 million toward the financing of the project and SCA and
the Government are negotiating with other potential lenders another US$15
million (para 4.07). SCA and the Government have requested a Bank loan of
US$50 million equivalent to help finance the foreign exchange cost of the
rehabilitation estimated at US$181 million.

III. THE SUEZ CANAL AUTHORITY
A. General
3.01      After the 1956 nationalization of the Compagnie Maritime Universelle
du Canal de Suez, SCA was set up by Decree Law No. 146 of July 13, 1957 to
manage, operate, maintain and improve the Canal. SCA's by-Laws provide that
it is an autonomous legal entity administered by a Board of Directors. The
President of the Republic appoints the Board, the Chairman, and the Director
General. SCA is largely independent of Government rules and restrictions
governing public and private enterprises, and is free to follow efficient
commercial procedures. This broad delegation of power is somewhat limited,
however, inasmuch as SCA's annual budget has to be reviewed by the Finance
and Planning Ministries and approved by the Presidential decree (para 3.14).
3.02      Five years after the Government nationalized the Canal, it nation-
alized existing companies and created new ones to provide services to SCA,
which previously had been provided by private local and foreign contractors.
These companies dealt with shipbuilding and repair (Suez Maritime Arsenal,
Timsah Shipbuilding Co., and Canal Naval Construction), ship repair and
metallic construction (Port Said Engineering Co. and Canal Harbor Works)
manufacturing of maritime equipment (Canal Rope Co.), and rental of equipment
and ship services (Canal Mooring and Projector Co.). The Government owns the
companies, but they are financially autonomous, with separate budgets and ac-
counts and independent auditors. SCA appoints their Boards of Directors,
which are responsible to SCA's Department for Affiliated Companies. SCA's
financial liability is limited to. channeling Government loans to these com-
panies. SCA receives 10% of the companies' profits after deduction of re-
serves, and the balance is divided between SCA and the companies' workers in
a 75:25 ratio. In 1967, SCA's income from affiliated companies amounted to
LE 183,000 (US$440,000). During closure, all companies except the Canal
Mooring and Projector Co. shifted to general contracting and remained profitable.
B. Organization and Management
3.03      At nationalization, the Government appointed a number of top civil
servants and military personnel to take over the Canal; most have remained
in office. At present, the Board of Directors consists of eight Directors
and a Chairman, who is also the Managing Director. The Government is not
represented on the Board. The eight Directors are also the heads of the
main departments, dealing with works, transit, procurement, shipyard, admin-
istration, affiliated companies, engineering, and planning. In addition,
three offices (Legal, Public Relations, and Follow-Up) report directly to
the Chairman.



-7-
3.04      Before closure, SCA's headquarters was in Ismaelia and each depart-
ment had a branch in Port Said and Suez. Annex 8 shows the organization of
SCA. Departments are autonomous, with their own accounting and personnel
sections, and appear to be working independently within their own field
budget. While this system did not create any particular problems in the
past, it could become a major obstacle when major rehabilitation work is
to be undertaken and close coordination between departments is required.
Responsibility for coordinating the tasks of various departments lies with
the Planning Department and Follow-Up Office. The Planning Department, which
is also responsible for long-term development has neither the staff nor the
ability to perform usefully. Recent studies conducted by SCA, and more par-
ticularly those related to the future expansion of the Canal show SCA's lack
of expertise in economic and financial evaluation of large investment projects.
SCA agreed to employ consultants satisfactory to the Bank to assist SCA's
staff in developing and strengthening its capabilities in financial and econo-
mic planning and project evaluation.
C. Operations
3.05      Before closure, SCA controlled operations of the commercial port
of Port Said but not those of Suez. It also controlled the approach of
vessels at both ends of the Canal. Navigation in the Canal was governed
by Rules of Navigation, published and enforced by SCA, which defined proce-
dures to be followed for approaching the entrance, forming convoys, and
transitting. These Rules were complex and strictly enforced by pilots
provided on board. Transitting vessels were organized in convoys, two
northbound and one southbound every 24 hours. SCA also operated all tugs,
signal stations, navigational aids, etc. At closure, SCA employed about
13,500 workers, staff, and labor including about 260 pilots, 60 tug masters,
and 30 harbor masters.
3.06      During closure, SCA decided to retain most of its persoanel.  This
decision was justified since it was not known when the Canal could be reopened.
Most pilots, however, left SCA to work for other agencies in Egypt or abroad.
SCA personnel was evacuated from the Canal Zone during hostilities, and only
now is returning gradually.
3.07      As soon as the Canal is reopened, SCA intends to reintroduce its
former operating procedures. SCA has contacted many former pilots and has
asked them to return to Ismaelia. The response has been favorable. SCA
also has started minor salvage and rehabilitation work. Now that SCA per-
sonnel is returning to the Canal Zone, no shortage of skilled labor is ex-
pected. SCA is confident that, despite heavy destruction in Port Said and
Suez, it will be able to keep the Canal in operation without interruption.
The magnitude of work, however, calls for qualified labor and supervisors
who may not be readily available in all disciplines. The Government has
given informal assurances to the Bank that it will encourage any reasonable
steps, including appropriate incentives, SCA may consider it necessary to
attract and retain the services of skilled and qualified staff.



3.08      SCA staff will provide a program to train and refresh all staff
required for handling the forecast traffic of the reopened Canal. The pro-
gram is expected to begin as soon as suitable buildings are available in
Ismaelia (probably before the end of 1974) and will cover 300 pilots, 58
tug masters, and 28 harbor masters. Recruits will be given training courses
and existing staff will be given refresher courses. Recruits will be person-
nel from the Egyptian Merchant Navy and Navy as well as civilians. Training
will be three to six months, depending on the candidates' proficiency. Pilots
will have a probationary period of at least one year after training. These
arrangements were confirmed by SCA and are satisfactory. SCA agreed to employ
consultants satisfactory to the Bank to assist SCA's staff in improving opera-
tional procedures and has given informal assurances to the Bank that it will
establish and maintain performance indicators to control its efficiency (Annex 9).
3.09      SCA's main workshop and repair facilities are at Port Fouad and
auxiliary workshops are at Port Said, Ismaelia, and Port Tewfik where SCA's
floating equipment is maintained and repaired. SCA also operates water
treatment plants in the three Canal cities and electricity generating plants
at Port Fouad and Port Said.
D. Insurance
3.10      SCA has third party liability coverage for damage caused by its
personnel or equipment. According to international practice, shipmasters
are responsible for damage caused to moving vessels.
E. Finance
3.11      Before closure, the main source of SCA's revenues was canal dues,
which until 1967 were set according to the terms of the Egyptian Government's
Declaration of April 24, 1957 to the United Nations (Annex 10). Some subsi-
diary income was also derived from affiliated companies and public distribu-
tion of electricity and water. SCA pays 5% of its gross income from canal
dues to the Government as a royalty and pays income tax (para 5.04), as well
as transfers the surplus after payment of royalty, taxes, and interest on
outstanding debt to the Government, although its By-Laws do not require such
transfer.
3.12      Despite SCA's autonomy, its annual budget for current and capital
expenditures has to be reviewed by the Finance and Planning Ministries and
approved by Presidential decree (para. 3.01). The annual budget is based
on the past year's results and includes SCA's local and foreign currency
requirements for the next year. Within the limit of the approved budget,
SCA can draw foreign exchange from the Central Bank without further approval.
This procedure appears to have worked smoothly when the Canal was in opera-
tion. Since closure, however, Government interference with SCA's management
has been increasing and SCA's autonomy has been somewhat limited. The Govern-
ment has given informal assurances to the Bank that it will ensure that SCA



- 9 -
carries out its operations and conducts its business without any diminution
of autonomy.
3.13      Until 1967, SCA was continuously profitable (para 5.04); transfers
to the Government were substantial, amounting to US$195.5 million equivalent
in 1967. With the exception of the 1959 Bank loan (US$56.5 million) and a
1964 Kuwait Fund loan (US$33 million), SCA has financed its investments from
internally generated funds. During closure, when SCA lost its main source
of income, the Government subsidized it and assumed debt service, contribut-
ing US$163 million as loans from the Central Bank (para 5.05). The Govern-
ment has stated that it will continue to provide the necessary local and
foreign currency to cover operating costs and debt service until SCA re-
sumes earning sufficient revenue (para 4.08).
F. Canal Dues
3.14      After nationalization in 1956, the Government did not change the
level of canal dues. The Declaration to the United Nations (para 3.11) stated
that "any increase in the current rate of tolls within any twelve months, if
it takes place, shall be limited to 1%; any increase beyond that level to be
the result of negotiations". Dues were increased by 1% three times between
1957 and 1967 (para 5.02). SCA intends to revise dues before reopening to
reflect changes in shipping patterns and costs and inflation. For this
purpose SCA has hired consultants (Englestadt Shipping Consultants, Norway;
Westinform, UK; ASCOT, France) to carry out a study of the potential traffic
through the Canal after reopening. Terms of reference for the study are
satisfactory and the Consultants' interim report should be available before
the end of 1974 in time for SCA to decide on new tariffs before reopening of
the Canal.
3.15      Revised canal dues will have wide economic and political consequences.
While the shipping community expects future dues to be considerably higher
than those prevailing in 1967 (most current shipping studies are based on -
dues two to three times higher), shippers would expect some savings to be
passed on to them. SCA and the Government confirmed that they were consider-
ing several tariff setting alternatives, including direct negotiations with
users and that a commission had been appointed to review this question and
make recommendations on the form of consultation that should take place before
new tariffs are published.
G. Audit
3.16      Auditors from the Government's Central Organization for Accounting
and Auditing audit SCA's accounts. The Audit is satisfactory and acceptable
to the Bank.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objective of the project is to enable ships to transit the
Suez Canal.
B. Description
4.02      The project is to rehabilitate the Canal and restore navigation in
the reopened Canal to its pre-1967 level of efficiency. It includes: (i)
clearing and reopening the channel, (ii) procuring materials and equipment,
(iii) reconstructing auxilliary facilities, and (iv) technical assistance and
studies.  The major elements are:
(a) Preparation of the Channel:
(i) Provision of light salvage equipment to remove about
100 minor wrecks and a causeway. This equipment will
be used later for routine salvage and maintenance op-
erations.
(ii) Provision of navigational aids (buoys, radar reflectors,
beacons, and marking lights) and telecommunications,
radar, and radio systems for monitoring and safety
of vessels in transit.
(b)  Repairs to the Channel -- Provision of dredgers as well as earth-
moving, quarry, and repair equipment to replace that destroyed
during closure. The equipment will be used initially for re-
pairs and subsequently for routine maintenance.
(c)  Services to the Channel -- Provision of floating equipment
(tug-boats, pilot vessels, motorboats, ferry boats, floating
cranes, tankers, barges, and antipollution equipment).
(d)  Workshop and Shipyards Rehabilitation -- Reconstruction and
reequipment of workshops and shipyards, thus permitting SCA
to build small vessels and to maintain and service floating
equipment.
(e)  Services -- Provision of land transport (vehicles, garages,
and service stations), field equipment, cranes, oxygen and
compressed air plants, medical services, water purification
and power plants, and office equipment to replace damaged
and obsolete facilities.



- 11 -
(f) Stores -- Replenishment of depleted stores, and provision of
materials and spare parts to maintain and service the Canal
as well as shipbuilding and structural steel, pipes, ropes,
cables, timber, paint, and small tools.
(g) Buildings, Houses, and Roads -- Rehabilitation of damaged
buildings and houses as well as damaged service roads.
(h) Local Work -- Relocation of evacuated workshops, repairs to
electric transmission lines, and resettlement of SCA's staff.
(i) Technical Assistance and Studies:
(i) strengthening SCA's capabilities, through technical
assistance and training, in financial and economic plan-
ning, project evaluation and operational procedures;
(ii) provision of a short-term study of traffic expected to
use the Canal and of the possible level of dues (para
3.15); and
(iii) provision of a long-term study of optimum size and
timing of future canal enlargement.
Annex 11 gives the justification for SCA's equipment program.
C. Cost Estimate
4.03      The project cost is estimated at US$288 million, of which the for-
eign exchange component is US$181 million or 63%. The cost excludes contri-
butions to canal preparation by the Egyptian, UK, and US Navies (paras 1.01
and 2.15) and interest during construction on external loans. But, as the
Government does not intend to waive any taxes or duties, the cost includes
customs duties up to 40%, costs of shipping and handling, and fees for local
agents, insurance companies, local fittings, and trials. Annex 12 gives de-
tails of the cost estimates which is summarized on page 12.
4.04      Costs of civil works have been derived largely from prices of
similar works that were being undertaken in the Canal Zone at appraisal time.
SCA confirmed these prices. They are based on SCA using a high percentage
of its labor force, which is competent, to repair revetments and construct
workshops, signalling stations and minor buildings, with local contractors
augmenting SCA's force account as necessary. Costs of equipment are based
on recent suppliers'prices, and are reasonable.

4.05      Bearing in mind SCA's current information on costs of most items
required for the project and the quick disbursement expected for the pro-
posed Bank-financed items (para 4.16), a total price contingency allowance
of 15% on the foreign exchange component and 25% on the local currency com-
ponent is considered appropriate. The 25% local currency contingency allow-
ance over the project construction period is considered realistic and in
keeping with the forecast of SCA. Physical contingencies have not been in-
cluded since the project will finance only procurement of equipment. During
loan negotiations, SCA and the Bank confirmed the project cost estimate.
D. Items Proposed for Bank Financing
4.06      The Bank proposes to finance the foreign exchange cost of items
suitable for international competitive bidding excluding those readily iden-
tifiable and suitable for bilateral lending such as dredgers, dredging equip-
ment, spare parts and floating cranes. The cost of the items to be financed
by the Bank is US$81 million, of which US$50 million is the foreign exchange
cost. Page 12 shows a summary of these items and Annex 13 shows details.
,During loan negotiations, the types of items to be financed by the Bank loan
were reviewed and agreed upon by SCA.
E. Financing Plan
4.07      The financing plan is summarized below:
Source of Finance                               Local   Foreign   Total
US$ million-------
Kuwait Fund (loan already obtained)                    0          33       33
IBRD (proposed)                                        0          50      50
SCA (expected from internally generated funds)        74           0       74
Minimum Government contribution                       33           0       33
Other assumed Foreign borrowing (second loan
from the Kuwait Fund, USAID and other Arab
and external sources)                                0          98      98
Total                                           107         181     288
The Kuwait loan is for 17 years including 2 years of grace at 4.5% interest.
USAID has indicated that it intends to contribute US$50 million towards the
financing of the project, subject to satisfactory congressional approval.
The terms and conditions of the USAID loan are expected to be for 40 years
including 10 years of grace at 3% interest. Other Arab and/or external
sources are expected to be on the same terms and conditions as the Kuwait
loan. The proposed Bank loan will be for 20 years including 4 years of grace
at 8% interest. Local currency costs will be financed by the Government and
by SCA's internally generated funds. The Government has agreed to authorize
SCA to retain that part of its earnings necessary to complete the project



- 14 -
and it has also agreed to guarantee cost overruns. Execution of satisfactory
agreements between SCA, the Government, the Kuwait Fund, USAID and other
external sources is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
4.08      Under these provisions (para 4.07), the Government will finance the
local costs of the project until SCA starts to generate its own funds from canal
dues in 1975. According to the financial forecasts (Chapter 5), the minimum
Government contribution will be US$33 million (LE 13.8 million) in 1974 to
cover local currency costs. In addition the Government agreed to provide SCA
with some LE 10 million (US$24 million) in 1974 as working capital to cover
operating deficits and debt service.
4.09      SCA is presently using the Kuwait Fund loan for the most urgently
needed items. Some items to be financed under the Bank loan also are urgently
needed.  Retroactive financing up to US$3.5 million is, therefore, recommended
to cover expenditures by SCA incurred after July 1, 1974 on items proposed to
be financed by the Bank. The need for retroactive financing was reviewed
during loan negotiations and the amount agreed upon by SCA.
F. Implementation
Responsibility
4.10      SCA will be responsible for carrying out the project.  Its well
qualified and competent engineering staff and experienced procurement de-
partment is capable of preparing specifications and contract documents suit-
able for international competitive bidding for procurement of the items pro-
posed for Bank financing. However, SCA has agreed to employ consultants,
satisfactory to the Bank, to modernize its workshops and to assist in the
procurement and installation of telecommunication systems.
Procurement
4.11      Procurement of Bank-financed items will be on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guidelines
for Procurement". Most items are replacements for existing equipment, and
SCA is familiar with the specifications required. Some spare parts will be
procured directly from manufacturers, based on negotiated prices (about US$4.3
million). All equipment will be provided with spare parts as recommended by
the manufacturers' guidelines for running and maintenance. Items financed by
USAID would be procured from the US, in accordance with USAID procurement
procedures. It is not yet known whether other lenders would require SCA to
follow particular procurement procedures. It is likely that SCA would use
its own procurement procedures of calling competitive bids from an established
list of suppliers for items to be financed under the Kuwait loan.
4.12      The major items financed under the Bank loan will be procured abroad.
Egypt has no regional preference treaties, and bids will be compared on a CIF
basis net of custom duties. Local manufacturers are not expected to contri-
bute substantially to procurement of Bank-financed items. However, for the



- 15 -
purpose of bid comparison, preference will be given to local manufacturers
to the extent of 15% of the CIF landed price of imported goods or the actual
customs duty, whichever is lower.
4.13      SCA will undertake building and repair mainly on a force account
basis, augmented by local contractors as required. SCA's shipyards are ex-
pected to build small motorboats, ferry boats, tankers, and barges at com-
petitive prices; provision for these items has been allowed in calculating
the foreign exchange component.
Construction Schedule
4.14      The construction period will be front the fall of 1974 to the end
of 1977. However, ships will be able to transit,. though possibly at reduced
speed, from the reopening date (end of April 1975). Rehabilitation of facil-
ities essential to navigation will have priority, and some temporary facilities
will be used in the early months of operation. The construction schedule was
confirmed during loan negotiations.
G. Disbursements
4.15      Disbursements under the Kuwait Fund loan have started and are ex-
pected to be completed by mid-1975. Disbursements under the proposed Bank
loan are scheduled to start in the first half of 1975 and to be largely com-
pleted by the end of 1977, with some minor payments of guarantee and retention
monies in early 1978. The outstanding amount to be provided by other donors
(US$98 million) must be available in the first half of 1975, and should be
fully distributed by the end of 1977. Annex 14 shows disbursements under the
Bank loan. Any surplus funds in the loan account after the project has been
completed should be allocated to similar items.
H. Safety Measures
4.16      Because all types of ships and cargoes will transit the reopened
Canal, safe and unrestricted transit will be a first priority of SCA. Ground-
ing of a single ship in any narrow stretch of the Canal will completely stop
transit. Collisions of ships with dangerous cargoes could cause fire, noxious
fumes, or pollution in any sector of the Canal and its environment. Removal
of oil and dangerous cargoes from crippled ships as well as collection and
treatment of oil slicks caused by transitting ships will be provided for
under the project. SCA's safety record over the years has been excellent,
and its experienced pilots and other operating staff are expected to perform
adequately when the Canal is reopened. The channel is stable under normal
working conditions, and the equipment to be provided under the Bank loan
will insure that first-class services on land and water are available for
all SCA operations. Continuation of SCA's good performance in handling ships
will result in minimum insurance premiums for ships transitting the Canal.

I. Ecology and Urban Development
4.17      Reopening the Canal will not be harmful to the region's ecology.
The tidal ranges at the eastern end of the Mediterranean and the northern
end of the Red Sea are too small to induce any sizable movement of water
along the Canal. The existing sweet water canal distributing fresh water
from the Nile River and brackish water from Lake Timsah, Great Bitter Lake,
and Little Bitter Lake has existed for many years, and reopening the Canal
will not interfere with natural conditions.
4.18      Silt will be dredged, pumped to embankments east of the waterway,
and allowed to settle. Clear water will percolate away or return to the
Canal.
4.19      Although the Canal is virtually a complete water separation between
Africa and Asia and a barrier to the passage of any non-swimming animals, few
animals in the area wish to make the journey.
4.20      The Ministry of Development is considering many schemes to develop
or exploit human and transit resources of the Canal Zone. These schemes in-
clude: industrial, urban, or tourism development; free trade zones; and
water and power supplies. They are not yet sufficiently advanced to be
described in this Report.
J. Future Expansion of the Canal
4.21      As explained in para 2.10, the average size of petroleum tankers
has been growing constantly during the closure of the Canal and is expected
to continue to do so until 1980. While almost all tankers in service could
use the Canal in 1966, it is projected that only 57% and 40% would do so in
1975 and 1978 respectively, if the Canal is not enlarged. At 1967 dimensions,
petroleum shipment would account for 47% and 30% of total traffic in 1975 and
1980 respectively, compared to 75% in 1966. The potential loss of revenues
based on the 1967 tariffs increased by 37% (para 5.03) would be about US$150
million annually and the potential loss to the world shipping community would
be of the order of US$250 million annually. SCA is fully aware of this and
has decided to proceed with dredging for the first stage of the enlargement
as soon as the channel is reopened. To that effect SCA has recently signed
a letter of intent with Japanese contractor for dredging on the most diffi-
cult part of the Canal to start by mid-1975. The letter covers only part of
the total dredging required for the first phase of the enlargement.
4.22      The first stage of the enlargement, as now envisaged, consists of
increasing the permissible draft and wet section of the channel from 11.5 m
to 16 m and from 1800 m2 to 3200 m2 respectively, by dredging some 350 million
m3. This is expected to be completed in four years at a total cost presently
estimated at US$720 million 1/, including additional works and facilities.
1/   Excluding interest during construction estimated at US$60 million.



- 17 -
4.23      The first stage of the enlargement will make it possible for tankers
of 150,000 dwt and of 250,000 dwt to use the Canal laden and in ballast re-
spectively.  It would increase potential petroleum traffic in 1980 from about
100 million dwt to about 300 million dwt, of which 200 million would be in
ballast.  According to SCA's plans, further expansion would be required after
1980, to accommodate VLCC's of 200,000 ton laden and of almost any size in
ballast. Details of the two cross sections are given on Map IBRD 8794.
4.24      There is little doubt that the first phase of the enlargement is
justified. A preliminary study shows that under conservative tariff (para
5.03) and traffic assumptions the project would yield a rate of return of
about 15%, and therefore SCA's decision to proceed immediately with the ini-
tial dredging is understandable. However, there is a need for further studies
to determine the optimum size and timing of the proposed expansion. This was
reviewed during loan negotiations and SCA agreed to hire consultants to carry
out a study which among other things would: (i) review traffic projections;
(ii) determine savings in shipping costs achieved by the users of the enlarged
Canal under different levels of dues; and (iii) recommend the optimum size
and phasing of the enlargement. Terms of reference were reviewed by the Bank
and are satisfactory. The study should be completed by mid-1975. It was
also agreed that the Government and SCA will consult with the Bank, when
the results of the study are available, before deciding on the optimum size
and phasing of the enlargement.
4.25      Although from a technical point of view it would have been preferable
to wait until the study is completed before letting any dredging contract,
SCA's decision not to wait until the final results of the study is acceptable,
bearing in mind that the dredging contract provides for only part of the dredg-
ing required for the first stage and can be adjusted to accommodate dredging
to the dimensions finally decided. Any expansion would require extensive
dredging and in view of the incremental revenues to be derived from the ex-
pansion it is reasonable to start as soon as possible.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      SCA is a revenue earning entity whose income before 1967 was mostly
derived from dues levied on ships transitting the Canal. Additional income
was derived from berthing, towing, supplying electricity and water to Canal
Zone cities, shipbuilding and repairing, and renting of equipment.
B. Canal Dues
5.02      Between 1957 and 1967, canal dues were levied on ship tonnage ex-
pressed in Suez Canal Net Registered Ton (SCNRT) equivalent to 2.83 m ; they
were not based on canal operating costs and were not charged on cargo. Sur-



- 18 -
charges, called "improvement dues", also were imposed on ships with drafts
exceeding 11.60 m and/or with dimensions exceeding standards established in
the Rules of Navigation as a means of recovering costs of previous expansion
programs and of additional maintenance requirements created by large ships.
A 55% discount was granted to promote ships transitting in ballast, mainly
tankers. Dues were payable in advance in Egyptian pounds, acquired by sell-
ing convertible 'foreign exchange to the Central Bank. In 1967, dues were
LE 0.4373/SCNRT.
5.03      For the financial evaluation, 1967 dues were escalated by 37% to
account for: (i) past inflation (29%); and (ii) annual increases in dues of
1% between 1967 and 1975 (8%). However, a sensitivity analysis was carried
out to test SCA's financial viability against the 1967 level of dues increased
by only 8% (para 5.09).
C. Operating Results to 1967
5.04      Except for a decline after nationalization, SCA's earnings increased
consistently to reach LE 98 million in 1967. Operating costs were mainly
salaries, materials, and depreciation, and were essentially fixed costs.
From 1965 to 1967, they remained almost constant while revenues grew by
10% in real terms. In 1967, SCA's net income after payments of royalty
and income tax to the Government was about LE 58 million, or 59% of its
revenue. Up to 1967, SCA serviced its debt, contributed substantially to
financing relatively minor expansion programs, and accumulated substantial
cash reserves (LE 37 million by 1967).
D. Operating Results After 1967
5.05      During closure, SCA lost income from canal dues and incurred large
operating losses because of continued salary payments to retained staff (para
3.07). These losses ranged from LE 7.1 million in 1968 to LE 5.2 million in
1973. The losses and SCA's debt service requirements were covered partly by
Government loans from the Central Bank (4.5% interest, repayment period not
determined) and partly by SCA cash reserves. By the end of 1973, the Govern-
ment had contributed LE 67.9 million to SCA, and SCA had used up all its in-
ternal funds. Annexes 15 and 16 show Income and Cash Flow Statements.
5.06      At December 31, 1973, SCA had an accumulated deficit of LE 27 mil-
lion and long-term debt of LE 76.7 million. The long-term debt was divided
between loans from the Kuwait Fund (LE 7.0 million), and Government (LE 67.9
million). During loan negotiations, the Government has indicated its willing-
ness to forgive its loans.

E. Balance Sheets
5.07      Annex 17 shows balance sheets for 1965-67 (actual) and 1973 (esti-
mated). No meaningful balance sheets are available for 1967-73 because some
records were destroyed and SCA has not been able to carry out a complete in-
ventory of damages to assets resulting from hostilities.  Also, fixed assets
taken over upon nationalization in 1956 are still being carried on the books
at a nominal value of LE 1. A detailed inventory and revaluation of existing
assets is necessary. But this would take over one year because of staff as-
signments to priority reconstruction work, and could not be completed before
the projected date of reopening. Therefore, SCA gave informal assurances that
it will, not later than December 31, 1976: (i) carry out a complete revaluation
of fixed assets; (ii) adopt realistic depreciation rates reflecting the economic
life of these assets. SCA's accounting and engineering staff is competent to
do this work, and technical assistance is not likely to be required.
F. Financial Forecasts
5.08      Financial forecasts are based on canal dues as defined in para 5.03
and Annex 18. Costs have been projected at 1973 levels on the assumption that
future dues will be adjusted to account for inflation. No provision has been
made for transfers of revenue surpluses to Government. Annex 19 gives other
assumptions.
5.09      Forecast Income Statements (Annex 20) show that annual surpluses
after payment of royalty, income tax, and interest will grow from LE 13.4 mil-
lion in 1975 to LE 60.7 million in 1980; in 1967, the surplus was LE 58 million.
Forecast Cash Flow Statements (Annex 21) also show that SCA will generate suf-
ficient funds to service its debt, to contribute LE 30.8 million to the project
(about 25% of the total project cost and 69% of the local cost), and to retain
a substantial cash balance of LE 208 million at the end of 1980. However, even
if tariffs were only to be raised by 8% (i.e. 1% p.a. from the 1967 level to
1975) and no adjustment made for devaluation (para 5.03), SCA would still be
financially viable; there would be annual cash surpluses from 1975 onwards and
an accumulated surplus of LE 139 million at the end of 1980. The financial
forecasts make provision for an investment of LE 300 million to finance the
first phase of the enlargement (para 4.22). It has been assumed that SCA
would borrow the entire amount from external sources on relatively soft terms
i.e. 25 years including 5 years of grace at 6% interest. Two other alternatives
were also considered to test the sensitivity of SCA's financial results against
different financing terms: (i) 100% borrowing for 15 years including five
years of grace at 10%; and (ii) 60% borrowing for 25 years including five
years of grace at 6%. Both alternatives show that SCA's financial viability
would not be impaired by the enlargement of the canal and that SCA would be
able to cover its costs and service its debts.

G. Financial Covenants
5.10      For reasons explained in para 5.07, the usual financial covenants
(debt equity ratio and return on net fixed assets) will not be sought for the
project. SCA agreed that, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree it would
not incur any debt, unless it is shown that its net revenues for the fiscal
year in which such debt is incurred and for any succeeding fiscal year shall
be not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement for such year
on all debts of the Borrower outstanding in each such year including the debt
to be incurred.
VI.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
6.01      Before 1967, the Suez Canal was one of the world's most important
shipping routes. Closure disrupted the shipping community and the economies
of a number of countries, and cost the world about US$4,355 million from 1967
to 1971 (para 2.08). Reopening will greatly reduce the sea distance on a
number of major trade routes and reduce shipping costs accordingly.  It also
will generate some activities in countries having an export potential for
products which cannot support high transport costs. These benefits will
not materialize rapidly, however, because of the time lag involved in pro-
moting new agricultural and industrial schemes. Also, they may be offset
by losses in countries which benefited from closure. Therefore, only bene-
fits derived from savings in shipping costs were taken into account in the
economic evaluation.
B. Savings in Shipping Costs
6.02      Savings in shipping costs are mainly in:  (i) fixed operating costs
(personnel, insurance, etc.) and capital costs per unit of cargo resulting
from faster ship turnaround time; and (ii) fuel. They were estimated for
different trade routes, cargoes (petroleum, bulk, general, and containerized),
and ship sizes. Annex 7 summarizes the assumptions.
6.03      Global savings in shipping costs are an adequate way of measuring
benefits generated by the project, but they do not adequately reflect the
distribution of benefits among shipowners, shippers, and SCA. Theoretically,
SCA could retain all benefits by charging dues equal to the savings of any
particular ship. This, however, would not give any incentive to shipowners
to divert traffic. To attract traffic, SCA will have to set dues which make
use of the Canal competitive with use of alternative routes. Such dues will
bring in revenues enabling SCA and Egypt to recoup part of the global savings;
shipowners will recoup the balance. Whether part of the savings will be passed
on to shippers depends on the structure of the market and competition between



- 21 -
shipowners. In the tanker market, shipowners will have little incentive to
pass on savings to consumers since the volume of petroleum transitting the
Canal will be limited and alternative routes will be used for most shipments
(Annex 7). The situation might be different for general and bulk cargo ship-
ping since competition on similar routes is keen and shippers will exert pres-
sure on shipping companies and conferences to obtain reduced freight rates.
C. Methodology
6.04      The economic evaluation is based dn comparison of the benefits
(savings in shipping costs) and the cost of carrying out the project. Cost
related to the enlargement of the canal or benefits according to SCA as a
result of the enlargement (para 4.21) were not taken into account.
6.05      The evaluation of global savings in shipping costs was based on
studies prepared by SC Shipping Consultants (Norway) and Petroleum Economics
Limited (UK) and reports from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (Energy) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Develop-
ment (Shipping). It was carried out as follows:
(a)  Traffic Prolections (Annex 6).  Since access to the Canal is
limited to ships of a certain tonnage, the percentage of each
trade transported on ships capable of passing through the
Canal had to be determined. Separate determinations were
made for petroleum, bulk cargo, general cargo, and contain-
erized cargo. Movements of goods were projected by main
trade routes as much as possible to relate them with statis-
tical observations on the size of ships traditionally plying
the routes.
(b) Savings in Shipping Costs (Annex 7). Savings in shipping
costs through use of the Canal instead of alternative routes
were calculated for each of the main trade routes and for
representative size groups of ships (tankers, bulk carriers,
liners, and container ships). In the case of tankers, savings
were calculated assuming that shipowners will only attempt to
recover fixed operating costs. This assumption was made to
take into account the prospect of depleted freight rates in
the near future as a combined result of excess tanker capac-
ity and of a relative decline in demand for petroleum.
(c) Traffic Build Up. The Canal is assumed to reopen by April 1975,
and traffic to be progressively diverted to reach the potential
level by the end of 1976. This assumption was made to take into
account: (i) the reluctance of shipowners to change their way
of operation; (ii) some uncertainties as to the safety of navi-
gation through the Canal; (iii) the time required to reorganize
and reequip port installations and agencies abandoned during
closure.



- 22 -
D. Traffic Projections and Saving in Shipping Costs
6.06      With future dues 37% higher than in 1967 (para 5.03), traffic in
terms of SNCRT is expected to grow from 55 million ton in 1975 to about 170
million ton in 1977 and then level off to 175 million ton by 1980. The rea-
son for traffic remaining almost constant is the decrease in petroleum traf-
fic, reflecting the progressive disappearance of small tankers, which offsets
the growth in dry cargo traffic. The share of petroleum traffic (in ballast
and laden) is expected to decrease from 47% in 1975 to less than 30% in 1980,
with about 75% of the tankers passing southbound.
6.07      Net savings in shipping costs after deduction of canal dues would
amount to US$315 million in 1975 and US$1,250 million in 1980. They would be
divided between tankers and dry cargo ships in a 40:60 ratio in 1975 and 30:70
ratio in 1980. Under the assumption for dues (para 5.03)., revenues to SCA
would amount to about US$80 million in 1975 and to US$250 million in 1980.
E. Rate of Return
6.08      Savings achieved as a result of the project are so large that no
doubt exists about its justification. Since most of the savings would be
achieved by dry cargo ships (para 6.07), the size of which is expected to
remain for a long time within the limits imposed by the present cross-
section of the Canal, the risk is minimum of savings being offset by rapid
technological changes as affected tankers in the 1960's.
6.09      Assuming tariffs at the level referred to in para 6.06, SCA's in-
come will amount to about 15% of global savings. The economic evaluation
shows that the project would, under this assumption, yield a rate of return
well in excess of 50%, which is extremely satisfactory (Annex 23).
F. Sensitivity Analysis
6.10      Higher dues than those taken into account (para 6.06) would result
in a reduction in global savings (gross and net) since: (i) shipowners on
certain routes would no longer have any incentive to divert traffic to the
Canal; and (ii) SCA would recoup a higher percentage of gross savings through
higher canal dues. The analysis shows that:
(a) A flat rate of US$3.3/SCNRT, or three times the 1967 level,
would result in a 15% reduction in gross savings. Petroleum
traffic would be more affected than dry cargo traffic and
savings for tankers would decrease by 36% while savings for
dry cargo ships would decrease by only 5%. This shows that
the dry cargo market and, more particularly liners and tramp
ships, is much more inelastic than the tanker market.



- 23 -
(b) Net savings, after deduction of dues, would decrease by about
30%. Income to SCA would increase 1.5 times compared to the
assumption in the financial evaluation, and gross SCA earnings
would amount to about 45% of gross savings.
Setting such a rate for tankers would almost certainly make future expansion
of the Canal unfeasible since dues would exceed savings to be achieved by
tankers over 200,000 dwt using the Canal instead of the Cape of Good Hope
route.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement has been reached on the principal issues referred to in
the preceding chapters and more particularly on the study of the enlargement
of the Canal (para 4.24). Subject to the conditions of effectiveness described
in para 4.07, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$50 million
to SCA for a term of 20 years corresponding to the economic life of the equip-
ment, including a period of grace of 4 years corresponding to the disbursement
period.

APPRAISAL OF
THE REHABILITATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Suez Canal
A. Introduction
1.        In 1967, the Suez Canal was a major feature in international seaborne
trade. Its closure, since July 1967, created a number of disruptions and
encouraged technological changes which would probably have been postponed
otherwise. The evaluation of future traffic through the Canal cannot, there-
fore, be a simple extrapolation of the past; it has to take into account the
changes in vessel size in main trade routes, in commodity trading and in ship-
ping costs which occurred over the past seven years. Also, to a certain extent,
future traffic will be affected by the level of Suez Canal dues and a sensiti-
vity analysis has to be carried out to determine the elasticity of traffic to
dues for different types of trade (oil, dry bulk, general cargo and containers)
since savings are different for each trade.
B. Tanker Traffic
2.        In 1967, about 275 million ton of goods passed the Canal, and oil
cargo accounted for about two-thirds of this amount. Over the past ten years,
oil traffic had been growing at an average rate of over 10% p.a. and it was
expected that future growth will at least maintain the same pace. Changes in
the size of tankers had occurred over the past five years and mainly since
1964/65, reflecting the world wide trend for larger size ships. It was ex-
pected that the number of tankers of over 70,000 dwt, which could not pass the
Canal fully-laden, would increase rapidly and SCA was considering an expansion
program to accommodate tankers of 125,000 tons fully laden.
3.        The Canal has now been closed for seven years and a number of impor-
tant changes occurred in world supply and demand for oil and in oil transporta-
tion. An evaluation of the future role of the Canal and of potential traffic
through the Canal should, therefore, be based on: (i) projected energy supply
and demand to determine the main trade routes and volumes to be transported
along these routes; (ii) changes in the composition and size of the world
tanker fleet to determine the number of tankers that could physically pass the
Canal fully or partially laden or in ballast; and (iii) the relative cost ad-
vantage to ship owners in using the Canal rather than alternative routes.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
Projected Oil SUpply and Demand
4.        In the later months of 1973 and early in 1974, the world oil supply
and demand picture has been shaken by a number of unprecedented events. First,
oil prices, which until the early 1970's had been declining in real terms,
started to increase at a very fast pace and second, the oil embargo imposed
by Arab producers led consuming countries to revise their attitude towards
the consumption of oil, and to adopt conservation programs to reduce the cost
of imported oil supplies. Consuming countries reappraised their future needs
for oil in the light of much higher prices and decided to develop and/or main-
tain local production of fuel, which, before the crisis, were not deemed fea-
sible. The present evaluation is based on: (i) supply and demand projections
prepared by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and
(ii) an analysis of past oil movements between producing and consuming coun-
tries. The main results are given in Tables 1 and 2 for Western Europe and
North America. These tables show that the annual volume of oil to be trans-
ported by tankers from the Middle East to Europe and North America after local
production and supply from other sources (North and Western Africa and Carribean)
and/or by other modes (pipelines between the Middle East and the Mediterranean)
have been used, should decrease from 700 million ton in 1975 to 600 million ton
in 1980. Should any of these other sources fail to provide the required volumes
or should the consumption in Europe and North America increase more rapidly
than presently contemplated, then the difference would have to be made up by
additional supply from the Middle East and potential traffic through the Canal
would increase accordingly.
The Evolution of the Tanker Fleet
5.        The composition and size distribution of the tanker fleet is given
in Table 3 for the years 1973 and 1978. It is based on existing tankers and on
orders which have been registered with ship yards. Over the next four years,
it is expected that total tanker capacity will almost double with the larger
increase in sizes of over 250,000 ton. This situation results from large
orders placed during the second and third quarter of 1973 following the abro-
gation of the import quota system in the US and resumption of growth in oil
consumption in Europe. Although it is expected that some orders will be can-
celled or delayed, it is currently accepted that there will be a large excess
of tanker capacity over the next few years which could be as much as 50 million
dwt despite accelerated scrapping and laying up. The number of tankers under
125,000 dwt that could pass through the Canal laden or in ballast is expected
to account for 35% of the total tanker fleet capacity component to 53% in
1973.
Tanker Costs
6.        The cost of shipping oil is made up of:  (i) capital costs of the
tanker which depend on the initial construction costs and of the return on
investment expected by the ship owner; (ii) fixed operating costs including
maintenance, manning and insurance; and (iii) voyage costs including fuel
costs, port charges etc. The main assumptions used in calculating the cost



ANNEX 6
Page 3
of shipping oil are given in Table 4 for different sizes of tankers. They
are based on studies prepared recently (Spring 1974) by Petroleum Economics
(Consultants UK) and SC Shipping Consultants (Norway).
Potential Traffic
7.        Potential traffic through the Canal has been estimated on the basis
of the size distribution of tankers on the major trade routes. This distribu-
tion results from technical parameters such as draft limitation at certain
ports of entry (US east coast) size of refineries and possible mix of crude
oils. The estimates rely on studies carried out by SC Shipping Consultants
(Norway) who have been following the tanker market for a number of years. The
consultants' results have been achieved by tracing and counting tankers on
various routes and are considered reasonable. It has been assumed that tankers
under 70,000 dwt would pass the Canal laden and in ballast, that tankers between
70,000 dwt and 100,000 dwt would pass the Canal in ballast only and that 75%
of tankers between 100,000 dwt and 125,000 dwt would pass in ballast.
8.        Potential traffic estimates are given in Table 5 and show that poten-
tial tanker traffic for crude oil will decrease from 40.5 million dwt in 1975
to 3.0 million ton in 1980 for laden tankers and from 143.0 million ton to
44.0 million ton for tankers in ballast. The main reasons for the decline
are: (i) the progressive disappearance of small size tankers (35,000 dwt to
70,000 dwt) which are gradually replaced by very large crude carriers; (ii)
the relative decline of Middle East exports to Europe; Middle East supply
which in 1975 is expected to cover some 70% of total European demand would
only account for 55% in 1980; and (iii) the construction and/or expansion of
pipelines connecting Middle East producers with the Mediterranean. However,
while crude oil traffic is expected to decline, products traffic is expected
to grow following the construction of large refining capacities in the Middle
East (Iran, Saudi Arabia...).  Products traffic is expected to grow from 11.0
million ton in 1975 to 25.0 million ton in 1980 for laden cargo and from 11.0
million dwt to 30 million dwt for tankers in ballast.
C. Bulk Traffic
9.        Bulk cargo shipping has undergone important changes since the closure
of the Canal. The improvement of mechanical handling equipment, the speciali-
zation of ports as well as increasing volumes of trade have promoted different
methods of shipping. Specialized bulk carriers are more and more frequent and
are plying on definite routes. The analysis of future development in bulk
commodity trading is based on studies carried out by various consultants,
Westinform (UK) and principally SC Shipping Consultants (Norway). The results
arrived at by these two firms are close and are considered reasonable. In
both cases, they are based on surveys made along different routes and on ship
tracking along these routes in order to determine the most likely pattern of
trade and the size of vessels most likely to be used on these routes.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
10.       The analysis was carried out as follows:
(i) identification of the major commodities (iron ore, pig iron,
steel manganese, bauxite, phosphate, sulphur, fertilizers,
salt, grain, soya beans, hogs and lumber, bulk and paper
and pulp);
(ii)  estimates of inter area trade from 1975 to 1980 for each
comodity by origin and destination;
(iii) estimates of the percentage of each trade which would be
affected by the reopening of the Canal; and
(iv) estimates of the distribution of bulk carriers by size groups
on each trade route and for the main commodities based on
physical observation of past ship movements.
11.       The results of the analysis summarized in Tables 6 and 7, show that
at the 1967 level of dues, bulk cargo traffic would grow from 33 million ton
in 1975 to about 40 million ton in 1980. Northbound and southbound traffic
would be divided in the ratio 60:40 in 1975 and 55:45 in 1980. No important
changes are expected in the type of commodities. Traffic in ballast would be
minimum since bulk carriers often operate on a triangular route to reduce in
ballast time. Total savings to shipowners would amount to US$53 million in
1975 and US$50 million in 1980.
D. Potential General Cargo Traffic
Liners and Tramp Vessels
12.       The evaluation of future liner and tramp vessel traffic presents
some problems since it cannot be based on the evaluation of the movement of
goods as for oil or bulk cargo. These vessels carry mixed general cargo
which is not identifiable and, therefore, the estimate of future traffic
is based on the expected number of ships passing the Canal. As for other
cargo, it was derived from actual ship movements in 1973 on routes that
would be affected by the reopening of the Canal (Europe - South East Asia,
North America - Middle East and Asia, S.E. Africa - Europe and North America)
13.       The results arrived and have subsequently been escalated at 6% p.a.
until 1980. This rate of growth does reflect pre-closure growth through the
Canal and post-closure growth on alternative routes. Although no detailed
forecast was made for individual routes, because of the lack of reliable basic
data, traffic has been projected by direction of trade i.e. southbound and
northbound. The results are summarized in Table 8 and show that liner trade
and tramp trade would account for respectively about 80% and 20% of total
general cargo trade and be about equally distributed between northbound and
southbound. The results are expressed in terms of Suez Canal Net Registered



ANNEX 6
Page 5
Tons (SCNRT) and were derived from a statistical analysis of the eqviivence
in SCNRT of various types of liners and tramp ships.
Container Ships
14.       Container transport appeared after the Canal was closed.  There is,
therefore, no experience in dealing with that particular form of transport.
An analysis was made by consultants of container traffic on various routes
which would benefit from the reopening of the Canal. The main trade routes
affected are from northern or southern Europe to the Far East, Australia,
India, Pakistan and the Middle East. The main problem in entrusting container
carrier traffic is to find an equivalence between the standard type measurement
(dwt and grt) and the Suez Canal measurement system.  Since conts1ner ships
did not exist in 1967, such equivalent cannot be estimated by statistical
methods and for the purpose of the analysis, it has been assumed that on gross
registered ton would be equivalent to 0.60 SCNRT. The results of the analysis
are summarized in Table 9 and show that container traffic is expected to in-
crease from 16 million SCNRT in 1975 to 26 million SCNRT in 1980, the traffic
being equally balanced between northbound and southbound.
E. Others
15.       It has been estimated that about 15% of the traffic will be vessels
which have not been accounted for. This has been added to the total potential
traffic which is summarized in Table 9.
F. Traffic Build Up
16.       It is expected that the Canal will be reopened at the end of the
first quarter of 1975.  It would, however, take some time for traffic to be
diverted to the Canal since shipowners may feel a certain apprehension as to
the safety of navigation and also because arrangements have to be made to
obtain new bunkering facilities, offices, etc. in the new ports of call. It
has, therefore, been estimated that traffic in the first year would be 40%
of the potential traffic and 80% the second year. The results are given in
Table 10.

APPRAISAL OF
THE REHABILITATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Savings in Shipping Costs through Reopening the Suez Canal
A. Introduction
1.        The reopening of the Suez Canal will considerably shorten sea routes
between North America, the Caribbean, Europe and countries located southeast
of Suez. Shorter distances will result in savings in shipping costs: (i) by
reducing capital and fixed operating costs per unit of cargo due to faster
turnovers of ships; and (ii) by reducing voyage costs and mostly fuel costs.
Savings, however, would be different for various type of ships and various
routes and have to be estimated separately (para. B).
B. Savings in Shipping Costs
Tankers
2.        Savings have been calculated on the basis of ship operating costs
(Annex 6, Table 4) and voyage parameters for the most representative size
groups and routes. The results are summarized in Table 1. Two assumptions
were made:
(i) Tanker market will remain stable over the next few years and
supply and demand would be balanced. Freight rates would then
reflect full cost recovery (capital and fixed operating costs).
(ii) The tanker supply will exceed the demand and freight rates will be
low for the next 3 to 5 years, and could be based, at least for
a while, on fixed operating costs recovery only.
As explained in Annex 6, it is likely that there would be an excess in the
tanker supply, if growth in oil demand slow down as it is presently expected.
However, any increase in oil demand would result in additional shipments from
the Middle East and would absorb some of the foreseen excess capacity.
Bulk Carriers, Liners, Tramps and Container Carriers
3.        Savings have been calculated on the basis of calculations made by
consultants (SC Shipping Consultants (Norway)) that are considered reasonable.
A summary of savings on the main trade routes for liners and tramp ships and
container carriers are given in Table 2 and 3 respectively.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
Global Savings
4.        Global gross savings (before payment of any Canal dues) are summa-
rized on Table 4 for each of the main categories. For tankers, savings based
on fixed operating costs have been taken into account. Table 4 also shows
global net savings after payment of Canal dues under the assumptions spelled
out in para 6 of Annex 19. They have been calculated taking into account the
reduction in the volume of traffic which would be induced by higher Canal
dues.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
No. 3821. Declaration 1/ Made By The Government of Egypt On the
Suez Canal And The Arrangements For Its Operation.
Cairo, 24 April 1957.
24 April 1957
In elaboration of the principles set forth in their memorandum
dated 18 March 1957, the Government of the Republic of Egypt, in accord with
the Constantinople Convention of 1888 2/ and the Charter of the United Nations,
makes hereby the following Declaration on the Suez Canal and the arrangements
for its operation.
1.   Reaffirmation of Convention
It remains the unaltered policy and firm purpose of the Government
of Egypt to respect the terms and the spirit of the Constantinople Convention
of 1888 and the rights and obligations arising therefrom. The Government of
Egypt will continue to respect, observe and implement them.
2.   Observance of the Convention and of the Charter of the United Nations
While reaffirming their determination to respect the terms and the
spirit of the Constantinople Convention of 1888 and to abide by the Charter
and the principles and purposes of the United Nations, the Government of Egypt
are confident that the other signatories of the said Convention and all others
concerned will be guided by the same resolve.
3.   Freedom of Navigation, Tolls, and Development of the Canal
The Government of Egypt are more particularly determined:
(a) To afford and maintain free and uninterrupted navigation for all.
nations within the limits of and in accordance with the provisions of the
Constantinople Convention of 1888;
(b) That tolls shall continue to be levied in accordance with the last
agreement, concluded on 28 April 1936, between the Government of Egypt and the
Suez Canal Maritime Company, and that any increase in the current rate of tolls
within any twelve months, if it takes place, shall be limited to 1 per cent,

ANNEX 10
Page 2
any increase beyond that level to be the result of negotiations, and, failing
agreement, be settled by arbitration according to the procedure set forth in
paragraph 7 (b).
(c) That the Canal is maintained and developed in accordance with the
progressive requirements of modern navigation and that such maintenance and
development shall include the 8th and 9th Programmes of the Suez Canal
Maritime Company with such improvements to them as are considered necessary.
4.   Operation and Management
The Canal will be operated and managed by the autonomous Suez Canal
Authority established by the Government of Egypt on 26 July 1956. The Govern-
ment of Egypt are looking forward with confidence to continued cooperation
with the nations of the world in advancing the usefulness of the Canal. To
that end the Government of Egypt would welcome and encourage cooperation be-
tween the Suez Canal Authority and representatives of shipping and trade.
5.   Financial Arrangements
(a) Tolls shall be payable in advance to the account of the Suez Canal
Authority at any bank as may be authorized by it.  In pursuance of this, the
Suez Canal Authority has authorized the National Bank of Egypt and is negotia-
ting with the Bank of International Settlement to accept on its behalf payment
of the Canal tolls.
(b) The Suez Canal Authority shall pay to the Governnent of Egypt 5 per
cent of all the gross receipts as royalty.
(c) The Suez Canal Authority will establish a Suez Canal Capital and
Development Fund into which shall be paid 25 per cent of all gross receipts.
This Fund will assure that there shall be available to the Suez Canal Authority
adequate resources to meet the needs of development and capital expenditure
for the fulfillment of the responsibilities they have assumed and are fully
determined to discharge.
6.   Canal Code
The regulations governing the Canal, including the details of its
operation, are embodied in the Canal Code which is the law of the Canal. Due
notice will be given of any alteration in the Code, and any such alteration,
if it affects the principles and commitments in this Declaration and is
challenged or complained against for that reason, shall be dealt with in
accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph 7 (b).
7.   Discrimination and Complaints Relating to the Canal Code
(a) In pursuance of the principles laid down in the Constantinople
Convention of 1888, the Suez Canal Authority, by the terms of its Charter,
can in no case grant any vessel, company or other party any advantage or
favor not accorded to other vessels, companies or parties on the same
conditions.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(b) Complaints of discrimination or violation of the Canal Code shall be
sought to be resolved by the complaining party by reference to the Suez Canal
Authority. In the event that such a reference does not resolve the complaint,
the matter may be referred, at the option of the complaining party or the
Authority, to an arbitration tribunal composed of one nominee of the complaining
party, one of the Authority and a third to be chosen by both. In case of
disagreement, such third member will be chosen by the President of the Inter-
national Court of Justice upon the application of either party.
(c) The decisions of the arbitration tribunal shall be made by a majority
of its members. The decisions shall be binding upon the parties when they are
rendered and they must be carried out in good faith.
(d) The Government of Egypt will study further appropriate arrangements
that could be made for fact-finding, consultation and arbitration on complaints
relating to the Canal Code.
8.   Compensation and Claims
The luestion of compensation and claims in connection with the nationali-
zation of the Suez Canal Maritime Company shall, unless agreed between the
parties concerned, be referred to arbitration in accordance with the established
international practice.
9.   Disputes, Disagreements or Differences Arising out of the Convention and
this Declaration
(a) Disputes or disagreements arising in respect of the Constantinople
Convention of 1888 or this Declaration shall be settled in accordance with
the Charter of the United Nations.
(b)  Differences arising between the parties to the said Convs-ntion ia
respect of the interpretation or the applicability of its provisions, if not
otherwise resolved, will be referred to the International Court of Justice.
The Government of Egypt would take the necessary steps in order to accept the
compuslory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in conformity
with the provisions of Article 36 of its Statute.
10. Status of this Declaration
The Government of Egypt make this Declaration, which re-affirms
and is in full accord with the terms and spirit of the Constantinople Conven-
tion of 1888, as an expression of their desire and determination to enable the
Suez Canal to be an efficient and adequate waterway linking the nations of the
world and serving the cause of peace and prosperity.
This Declaration, with the obligations therein, constitutes an in-
ternational instrument and will be deposited and registered with the Secretariat
of the United Nations.

Your Excellency,
The Government of Egypt are pleased to announce that the Suez Canal
is now open for normal traffic and will thus once again serve as a link be-

The Government of Egypt wish to acknowledge with appreciation and
gratitude the efforts of the States and peoples of the world who contributed
to the restoration of the Canal for normal traffic, and of the United Nations

basic principles relating to the Suez Canal and the arrangements for its oper-
ation. The memorandum contemplated a further detailed statement on the sub-

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Justification of the Suez Canal Authority's Euidpwent Pogrs4
A. General
1.        Since 1967 SCA has lost, because of the hostilities in the rogion,
some 6 dredgers, 10 tugs, 2 salvage vessels, 2 water barges, 3 floating cranes,
6 ferry boats, 2 floating hammers, 19 open barges, 15 pilot boats, and 25
service boats.
2.        Today, SCA has available for work or likely to be made available,
by suitable rehabilitation, the following floating equipment: 14 dvodgers, 7
hopper barges, 3 water barges, 2 floating hammers, 6 open barges, 10 tug
boats, 6 ferry boats, 6 pilot boats and 6 floating cranes.
3.        SCA sustained damage or loss of the following navigational aids:
33 long-tail light buoys, 76 spherical buoys, 189 light beacons, 402 bi-conic
buoys with lights, 15 bi-conic buoys with reflectors and 60 cylindrical buoys
with lights. In addition some 370 lanterns of various colors and flashing
sequences and 4,200 lead acid accumulators were lost.
B. Land Equipment
4.        SCA's land based equipment was as follows:

The program provides for a replacement of destroyed equipment and that which
is beyond economic repair either because of excessive damage or old age.
C. Dredgers
5.        The dredgers in the program will not be required for (nor could
they be made available in time) for the reopening of the canal. However, the
new dredgers would be available for dealing with the increased silt deposits
that will accrete when vessels again transit the canal. SCA intends to use
three new vessels, as available, for the soft digging of any canal expansion
and to leave the larger portion and the excavation in calcified rock to be
done by dredging equipment provided by contractors. Any surplus dredging
capacity over the above SCA's needs could be utilized on dredging the port of
Alexandria and reclamation works in the canal zone. The three new dredgers,
would in fact, replace the six lost dredgers and be more appropriate to SCA's
future needs.
D. Ferry Boats
6.        The ferry boats to be procured in the program will replace the six
vessels lost and three that are too old to be economically repaired.

APPRAISAL OF
THE REHABILITATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Suez Canal Dues and Future Revenue
A. General
1.        As explained in Chapter VII and Annex 6 and 7 a number of important
changes occured in the shipping industry since 1967. While most of the changes
occured in the transport of oil, dry bulk and general cargo were affected as
well. The future role of the canal has, therefore, to be evaluated in the
light of existing and potential markets which could be affected by its re-
opening. The volume of traffic which would pass the canal in the future depends
on two main parameters: (i) the physical condition of the canal, draft, width,
permissible length and speed; and (ii) the level of canal dues to be paid
by shipowners. Since this project is only concerned with the restoration of
the canal to its preclosure conditions, the physical conditions are well defined
(Chapter IV). Regarding the level of dues to be collected the question is
more complex since it is the first time that canal dues would have to be set
up after a long interruption of canal operations.
B. Unit of Measurement
2.        SCA has traditionally applied a single rate per Suez Canal Net
Registered Ton (SCNRT), a unit of measurement equivalent to 100 c.ft. of
space, whatever the type of the ship. Discounts were offered for ship in
ballast and surcharges were imposed to account for ship specifications over
and above Suez Canal permissible dimensions (beam, draft, length...).  While
this approach had the advantage of simplicity; once a ship is measured and on
records, billing was quite easy, it does present a number of difficulties for
the future. Traffic projections are derived from movements of goods and
expressed in metric tons, long tons, or deadweight tons, which have later to
be converted into SCNRT. This is uneasy since there are no real equivalence
between the various units. For the purpose of the study the following con-
version factor derived from statistical analysis has been used.

10/18,000 dwt.                                  1.75 dwt
Linear vessels
3/10,000 dwt.                                  1.30 dwt
10/18,000 dwt.                                  1.95 dvt
Container vessels                                 0.6  grt
These factors are approximate and indicate an order of magnitude. It is con-
sidered, however, that pending the results of more detailed studies thy wil
not introduce significant distortions in the evaluation of possible levels of
dues and of SCA's income.
C.  Taff Policy
3.        Traditionally transport rates are based on cost plus a reasonable
return on the capital invested and it has been the Bank policy to promote
such mechanisms in transport pricing policies all over the world.  In most
cases, the Bank was concerned that, if tariffs were not based on costs:
(i) the agency would not be financially viable and, therefore, would hAve to
be subsidized by the Government and/or the cQmmunity; and (ii) the alipcatiion
of scarce resources would be less than optimum.  In the case of SCk, ihe
problem is quite different, tariffs (canal dues) are not related to CoStS and
the agency has not only been financially viable but transferred to thet Gwveth-
ment important amounts of foreign exchange while financing a large part of ifs
expansion.
4.        To relate canal dues to costs would in this particular case be
impractical since SCA operates and maintains the canal but does not own the
waterway.  A cost based tariff would, therefore, only reflect the cost of
operations, as it would in railways if infrastructure were not accountqd for
in the determination of tariffs.  This could be remedied by valuing the canal
and accounting for its depreciation and a fair return on investment in the
determination of tariffs, but such an approach would not be practical, since
it would be extremely difficult to arrive at a fair value of the waterway.



AmNEX 18
Page 3
5.        Another approach which appears to be more manageable would be to
set canal dues at level(s) that would make the canal competitive with other
routes. Such an approach would be based on: (i) an analysis of the various
trades which could pass the canal either laden or in ballast (Annex 6);
(ii) of the savings achieved by shipowners (Annex 7); and (iii) of the future
prospects of the shipping markets. This approach, however, raises a number
of issues:
(i) since future prospects and saving might be different for various
type of shipping (tanker, bulk cargo and liner trade), it might
not be practical to have a uniform rate per SCNRT as previously;
(ii) savings in shipping costs would be different depending on the route
and basing canal dues on marginal savings would maximize traffic but
not necessarily SCA's income; and
(iii) what percentage of the savings should be appropriated by SCA, and
subsequently Egypt, what part should be kept by the shipowner as
an incentive to divert traffic and what part should be passed on
to shippers.
These questions are presently being investigated by SCA, which has decided to
hire consultants to carry out a traffic/tariff study.
D. Methodology Used
6.        For the purpose of the appraisal, the second approach was used and
two different cases were considered:
(i) traffic and SCA's income were estimated on the basis of 1967 dues
reevaluated by 1% p.a. according to the U.N. Delcaration of April
24, 1957 and expressed in 1967 monetary value. This is a conserva-
tive approach that will indicate the lower limit of SCA's income;
(ii) dues were estimated at three times, their 1967 level to reflect
the current opinion of the shipping community.
However, in each case, no distinction was made between transit laden or in
ballast voyage.
E. Projected Revenues
7.        The results are summarized in Table 1 which shows that in the first
case, traffic will be maximum and SCA's income will grow from LE 33 million
(US$82.5 million) in 1975 to LE 104 million (US$260 million) in 1980. In
the second case, traffic will be lower since on some routes shipowners would
not have any incentive to divert traffic to the canal but SCA's income will
be much higher growing from LE 53.3 million (US$133 million) in 1975 to LE
195 million (US$487.5 million) in 1980. The first assumption was retained
for the purpose of the financial evaluation.

Assumptions on which Suez Canal Authority's
Financial Forecasts are Based
The financial projections are based on the following principal
assumptions:
1.        Revenues have been derived using the traffic and tariff assumptions
discussed in Annexes 6 and 18.
2.        Constant 1973 prices for operating costs are assumed.  Salaries
and wages have been increased by 50% from 1975 to 1977, to allow for normal
increases which were not made during the closure of the Canal.
3.        The Government will take the necessary action to forgive the Gov-
ernment and Central Bank loans amounting to about LE 67.9 million at Decem-
ber 31, 1973.
4.        The existing fixed assets have not been further depreciated due to
the necessity of a complete revaluation. Depreciation on fixed assets to be
acquired has been calculated using the estimated economic lives of the assets.
5.        The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million (LE 20.8 million) will have
an interest rate of 8% p.a. for a period of 20 years, including four years of
grace.
6.        Other foreign exchange required will be borrowed at an interest
rate of 4.5% and 3% (Kuwait Loan and USAID Loan, respectively) for period of
17 years and 40 years respectively including two years of grace.
7.        Local currency borrowings in 1974, which include LE 10 million to
meet operating and debt service requirements, will be made through the Cen-
tral Bank at an interest rate of 4.5% p.a. for a period of 20 years, including
four years of grace.
8.        Local currency requirements for the project in 1975 and subsequent
years will be met from internal cash generation.
9.        Royalties paid to the Government will continue at 5% of transit
tolls revenue, and income taxes will continue to be assessed at the present
rate of 39.7% of net income. No income taxes will be payable in 1975 due
to the application of losses from the previous three years.



ANNEX 19
Page 2
10.       No attempt has been made to allocate the cash shown to be accumu-
lated on the forecast cash flow statements (Annex 20). It is a matter of
annual negotiation between SCA and the Government and will be either held
internally by SCA for future capital investments or distributed to the
Government.
11.       The first phase of the future expansion was included in the fore-
casts which assume 100% borrowing for 25 years including 5 years of grace at
6%, the first revenue from the expansion accruing in 1980.
