PHILIPPINES
MEDIUM SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested the Bank to assist
in financing irrigation development in the islands of Mindoro and Palawan.
The project would provide for the construction of irrigation facilities to
benefit about 38,000 ha of rice land, spread over seven irrigation systems.
The two islands are relatively unaffected by typhoons, are areas of immigra-
tion from the overcrowded islands of Luzon and the Visayas, and contain some
of the few remaining, easily developed substantial areas of irrigation
potential in the Philippines. The project would also support the Govern-
ment's policy of a more geographically balanced development program.
1.02      The project was prepared by the Project Development Department (PDD)
of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). This report is based on the
findings of a preappraisal mission in May 1979 comprising Mr. A.N. Khan and
Ms. V. Mackrandilal (Bank) and Messrs. R. Campbell and A. Yambao (consultants)
and an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. A.N. Khan, M. Cox, and Ms. V.
Mackrandilal (Bank), and Messrs. A. Yambao and G. Cazaux (consultants), which
visited the Philippines in September 1979. Messrs. E. G. Giglioli and R.
O'Sullivan assisted in writing the report.
The Agricultural Sector
1.03      Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy,
accounting for about one third of net domestic product, over one half of
total employment, and more than half of export earnings. Over 70% of the 9
million ha of land under cultivation is used for the production of cereals,
of which rice and corn are the most important. About 1.2 million ha are
irrigated. The remaining land is taken up by the major export crops: sugar,
coconuts, abaca, pineapples, and tobacco.
1.04      The performance of the agricultural sector is crucial in deter-
mining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly and
equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products is
limited by relatively low rural incomes. Although in recent years there has
been a substantial change in the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, the
problems of poverty and income distribution continue to be acute in rural
areas; of the 15 million people in the lowest 40% of the income scale, 12
million live in rural areas. To deal with this problem the Government has
initiated a number of programs designed to assist the rural poor.
1.05      A major Government objective is to increase rice and corn produc-
tion as a means of raising the income of small farmers and of attaining
national self-sufficiency in food grains. After experiencing substantial
deficits in the early 1970s, rice production grew by 5% p.a. during crop



-2-
years 1974-77 and the Philippines was able to provide for consumption solely
from domestic production during the crop years 1975-77. In 1978,
the Government exported 270,000 tons and built stocks to supply about four
months of domestic consumption. The major factors contributing to the recent
sharp rise in production appear to be the continued expansion of irrigated
area and the use of high yielding varieties on both irrigated and rainfed land
as well as a run of particularly favorable weather. With the continued growth
in population and incomes, the demand for rice is expected to rise by about
3.0% annually over the period 1978-90. Given average weather conditions, the
Philippines should be able to sustain an annual growth rate of 3.7% in produc-
tion and is expected to be, by 1985, in a position to export between 100,000
and 125,000 tons annually. By 1990 the Philippines could export from
350,000 to 375,000 tons.  Exports of this magnitude, about 3% of projected
world rice trade in 1990, could be accomodated without adversely affecting
prices. This would require an increase in irrigated harvested area of about
425,000 ha between 1977 and 1985 and an increase of about 200,000 ha between
1985 and 1990. World Bank-assisted projects for which financing has been
arranged or is contemplated would provide about 240,000 ha of irrigated
harvested area.
1.06      The Government recognizes that in order to increase production in
both irrigated and rainfed areas further improvements in supporting services
will be necessary beyond those initiated in recent years. In 1973, the
Government instituted a national program for supervised credit for rice
production, Masagana 99, which greatly increased the availability of produc-
tion credit and technical assistance, mainly to smaller farmers. However, the
levels of arrears under the program have been very high in the last several
years and as a result the credit coverage of the program has declined sharply.
The Government is aware of this problem and is presently reviewing a study of
the causes of the high arrears undertaken by the Technical Board for
Agricultural Credit under the provisions of Loan 1399-PH. In the meantime,
efforts are continuing to enable farmers to make the most effective use of the
lower level of inputs they are able to afford using their own cash and from
non-institutional sources of credit. The Government is also taking steps to
bring about improvements in the national extension service through the
recently initiated National Extension Project which is in part financed by
the Bank (Loan 1626-PH). The Bank is presently helping the government to
prepare a project to provide assistance to the agencies dealing with
agricultural research, crop protection, soils and agricultural economics.
1.07      Since 1969 the Bank Group has financed eleven irrigation projects
designed to increase rice production in the country. These projects - three
in Central Luzon, four in the Cagayan Valley of Northern Luzon, one on
Mindoro Island, one in the Visayas and two for smaller systems throughout



-3-
Northern Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao /1 - have set the pattern for the
type of irrigation rehabilitation, new construction, and operations needed
to increase rice production. The projects are providing improved irrigation
and drainage facilities, better road systems for efficiency of operation
and for the marketing of farm products, stronger supporting services to assist
farmers in adopting the new irrigation techniques needed to increase
production, and technical assistance and training to help the National
Irrigation Administration (NIA) expand and improve its irrigation program.
These projects would bring about substantial increases in rice production on
about 400,000 ha and would benefit over 200,000 farmer families, most of whom
are smallholders.
1.08      Work on the first Bank-assisted project, the Upper Pampanga River
Project (Loan 637-PH), is completed. Progress on all the irrigation projects
has been generally satisfactory and the NIA has proved itself to be a well
managed and technically competent organization. The total cost of the first
two projects was about 70% over appraisal estimates in the case of the
Pampanga project (Loan 637-PH) and 55% in the case of the Aurora-Penaranda
Irrigation Project (Loan 984-PH and Credit 472-PH) largely because of rapid
inflation following the oil price increase in 1973. However, as a result of
considerable increases in the projected world market price of rice and earlier
than anticipated irrigation benefits, the rates of return on both projects
have not changed significantly.
Prolect Formulation
1.09      The development of Mindoro and Palawan has lagged behind that of the
more populous and larger Luzon island. Mindoro is well endowed with land and
water resources and both islands have favorable climates being largely free
from typhoons. They are also relatively underpopulated and are areas of
active immigration from Central Luzon and the neighboring Visayas where
population pressures on land are intense. While NIA has had plans for the
development of the irrigation potential in Mindoro and Palawan for many years,
implementation has been delayed because of the need to give priority to the
/1  The Upper Pampanga River Irrigation Project (Loan 637-PH), Aurora-
Penaranda Irrigation Project (Loan 984-PH, Credit 472-PH), Tarlac Irri-
gation Systems Improvement Project (Loan 1080-PH), Mindoro Rural Devel-
opment Project (Loan 1102-PH), Magat River Multipurpose Project Stage I

traditional rice bowls in Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley and Mindanao. Irriga-
tion development in Mindoro and Palawan has been confined in the past to
private and/or communal schemes of 50 to 300 ha located on small streams. The
Mindoro Rural Development Project, initiated in 1975 with Bank assistance
(Loan 1102-PH), included provisions for the improvement and expansion of two
national irrigation systems of about 12,000 ha in Mindoro Oriental and helped
to focus attention on the island's irrigation potential. By 1978 the Mindoro
Project Office had identified an irrigable potential of about 70,000 ha spread
over the two island provinces. At-the same time the Region 4 Office of the
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) proposed a project for the
development of infrastructure in Palawan, including irrigation development.
As both islands are in the same administrative region, NIA decided to combine
the two sets of proposals into a Medium Scale Irrigation Project. The
proposed project, prepared by NIA's Project Development Department (PDD),
consists of the construction of seven new national irrigation systems covering
a total area of about 37,800 ha, with three systems and 22,000 ha in Mindoro
Oriental two systems and 5,800 ha in Mindoro Occidental, and two systems and
10,000 ha in Palawan.



THE. PROJECT AREA
General
2.01      The project would build seven irrigation systems with a total irri-
gable area of 37,800 ha on the islands of Mindoro and Palawan, which are
southwest of the main Philippine island of Luzon. These systems can be divi-
ded into three distinct subproject areas. The Mindoro Oriental subproject
includes three systems while the 1{indoro Occidental and Palawan subprojects
include two systems each. Mindoro is separated from Luzon by a sea crossing
of about 45 km. Palawan is some 300 km to the southwest of Mindoro (Map
14589). Both islands are rugged and mountainous with large areas of unin-
habited forest. Mindoro, with a land area of 10,250 sq km and a population of
about 550,000, is divided administratively into two provinces Mindoro Oriental
and Mindoro Occidental. Palawan, which has a land area of 15,000 sq km and a
population of some 350,000 forms one province, the largest in the Philippines.
Presently, rice is the main crop grown in the project lands. However, in
addition to some small areas of corn and tobacco scattered in the different
subprojects, there are 2,500 ha of old and low yielding coconuts in Mindoro
Oriental as well as 3,200 ha of uncultivated brushland in Palawan where the
project areas lie mainly within a Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) land
settlement. Population density in all three provinces is substantially below
the national average and per capita incomes range from 92% of the national
average for Mindoro to about 65% for Palawan. The population lives mainly in
the rural areas, but there are a number of small towns around the periphery of
both islands. In Mindoro the most important town is Calapan in Mindoro
Oriental where there is an important port and where banking, storage, and
processing facilities are to be found, as well as supplies of agricultural
inputs. In Mindoro Occidental similar facilities are available in the town of
San Jose. In Palawan the towns are generally smaller and the services are
less developed. Puerto Princesa on the eastern shore of the island is the
most important urban center.
Climate
2.02      Four distinct climatic types are found in the Philippines, depending
on the amount and distribution of rainfall. Three of these types, the first,
third, and fourth, prevail in the project provinces. The first type, found
in Mindoro Occidental, is characterized by a very pronounced wet season
between May and October and a dry season for the rest of the year; the third
type found in Palawan, is relatively dry between January and April and wet for
the remaining months of the year; while the fourth type, found in Mindoro
Oriental, has no maximum rainy period and no dry season. Average annual
rainfall varies from a low of about 1,600 mm in Palawan to nearly 2,200 mm in
Mindoro Occidental. There is little monthly variation in temperatures and
relative humidities throughout the year or between the three provinces. The
rainfall, together with river flows in the wet season, is generally adequate
for a single rice crop. Dry season cropping, however, entails a greater risk
and irrigation is essential to ensure a crop. A large proportion of the



-6-
typhoons that occur in the Philippines do not hit the three provinces directly
and pass through south of Mindoro island, sometimes touching the northern edge
of Palawan. Climatological data in a summarized form are given in Annex 1.
Topography Drainage and Soils
2.03      Although the three subproject areas are separated geographically,
they have generally similar characteristics. The proposed systems are located
on the coastal plains ranging in width from 4-5 km in Palawan to 10-15 km in
Mindoro Oriental. The plains are not continuous on either island and in
places the mountainous central ranges extend to the coastline. In Palawan the
gently sloping coastal plain abuts directly onto the steep slopes of the
central mountain spine of the island while in Mindoro the transition from
plain to mountain is less abrupt. The land is flat within the project area
with generally good surface drainage, except for the extreme lower reaches of
the rivers near the coast and in the vicinity of lake Naujan on the south-
eastern edge of the Mag-asawang Tubig system in Mindoro Oriental. This parti-
cular area also has a moderate incidence of schistosoniasis. Provision would
be made under the project to deal with the drainage problem. The rivers
serving the proposed systems are short, ranging in length from 10 km up to
70 km. Due to the short river lengths, steep slopes in the upper mountainous
range with abrupt transition to flat plains and very high seasonal variation
between wet and dry season flow, most rivers in IMindoro have developed wide,
abraided, gravel-filled channels over their lower reaches. Channel shifting
in these reaches is not uncommon.
2.04      Soils in the Mindoro subproject areas are variable, but loams and
silt loams, clay loams and clays of the Agustin, San Manuel, Quingua and
Tagulod series predominate. These soils are of alluvial origin, moderately
deep and generally have good internal drainage. Soils of the Agustin and San
Manuel series are brown, dark brown and grayish brown, loose and friable with
good fertility, good internal drainage and are suitable for diversified crops.
Soils of the Quingua and Tagulod series are silty clay loams and clays and are
of dark grayish brown to gray color with weak angular blocky structures,
sticky when wet and friable when dry, slightly acidic reactions, slow internal
drainage, occasionally low phosphoric acid specially in Mindoro Oriental,
adequate cation-exchange capacity and no salinity problems. The predominant
soil type in the Palawan subproject areas is a clay loam of the Bugsuanga
series. Soils of this type are developed from transported terrace soil
materials, are of shallow depths, and are of dark grayish brown color with a
weak, fine granular structure, good internal drainage, moderately acidic to
neutral reactions, fairly high organic matter, low phosphoric acid, adequate
cation-exchange capacity and no salinity problems. Preliminary results
obtained from 1975-79 rice production experiments on paddy soils in Palawan
indicate a deficiency in phosphorous. An application of about 40 kg/ha of
phosphoric acid, is recommended for these soils. The soils of the three
subproject areas are well suited for rice which has been grown on them for
many years.

2.05      Since 1972 the Government has pursued a program of agrarian reform
aimed at the transfer of land ownership to tenant farmers on rice and corn
lands. Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27), the basic legislation of the new
program, provides for the transfer to the tenant, whether sharecropper or
leaseholder, of up to 3 ha in an irrigated area and 5 ha in a rainfed area.
According to PD 27, the landlord may retain up to 7 ha if he tills the land
himself. Since there are some two million rice and corn farmers on about
4 million ha, of which less than 1 million ha are irrigated, there is little
prospect of achieving the 5 ha rainfed and 3 ha irrigated family farms nation
wide. The Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) completed the issue of land
transfer certificates to tenants for all lands in holdings over 24 ha in 1975.
In November 1974, the Government decided to proceed with the transfer of land
in holdings between 24 and 7 ha. In October 1976, the Government extended the
provision of PD 27 to holdings of less than 7 ha, belonging to landowners with
more than 7 ha of other agricultural land, or belonging to landowners with
residential, commercial or urban land from which they derive adequate incomes
to support themselves. At present it is not known how many landlords and
tenants would be affected by the new legislation.
2.06      NIA surveys show that about 11,600 farm families live in the project
area. More than 80% of these families live in Mindoro, mostly in the Oriental
province. In Palawan the average farm size is 5.2 ha, in Mindoro Oriental
2.8 ha, and in Mindoro Occidental 3.1 ha. The farm size distribution in the
three subproject areas is as follows:

In the two Mindoro provinces, most of the farms are between 2 and 4 ha.
There is more dispersion around the mean farm size in the less densely
populated province of Mindoro Occidental where farms of more than 7 ha
account for 10% of the farms and 26% of the area. In Palawan where the
subproject is located mainly within a land settlement managed by the



-8-
Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR), farm sizes are substantially larger than
in the rest of the project. More than half the farms with 55% of the area
are between 4 and 7 ha, and 15% of the farms with 34% of the area are bigger
than 7 ha. However, nowhere in the project areas does the average size
of the bigger than 7 ha farms surpass 12 ha.
2.07      According to MAR information, the 37,800 ha in the project area
are owned by 9,490 people (see Table 2.1). The pattern of land ownership in
the three subproject areas is similar except for Palawan where the degree of
skewness is slightly more accentuated. In this province 5% of the owners
have holdings greater than 12 ha and account for almost 20% of the area.
Presently, in the total project area almost 45% of the farmers own the land
they are farming and account for 55% of the area, the rest are tenant
farmers. The Palawan subproject area has the highest proportion of owner-
operators with 77% of the farmers and 87% of the land. Most of these are
settlers on the MAR land settlement schemes in Narra and Aborlan munici-
palities. Tenancy is widespread in Mindoro where it ranges from 35% of the
farmers with 40% of the area in the Mindoro Occidental suproject to 57% of
the farmers and 51% of the area in the Mindoro Oriental subproject. After
completion of the Government's land reform program some 23,600 ha or 63% of
the project area will be cultivated by 6,100 owner-operators equivalent to
53% of the farmers (see Table 2.2).   The remaining 5,500 tenants would
operate under a written lease arrangement. The incidence of tenancy would
remain high in the more densely populated Mindoro Oriental subproject.
While MAR expects to complete the issue of land transfer certificates and
the transformation of share tenancy into leasehold contracts by December
1980, it can realistically be expected that this process will be finished
when the project is completed in 1985.

Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.08      About 3,000 ha within the project area are currently irrigated, most
of which are in communal irrigation systems. In Mindoro, the systems were
built by NIA and are operated and maintained by the benefited farmers. The
two communal systems in Palawan were also built by NIA to serve the settlement
areas and are operated by MAR. The level of facilities in the systems is
generally poor and maintenance is inadequate. Rice is the only crop grown on
the areas presently irrigated.
Transportation
2.09      The central mountain range in Mindoro makes land communication
between the two provinces difficult and there are no current plans for provi-
ding a connecting link. An existing gravel road along the eastern coast is
being improved and transformed into a concrete surfaced national highway in
Mindoro Oriental. The coastal gravel road along the western coast in Mindoro
Occidental is in a poor state and impassable during the rainy season because
there are no bridges across the main rivers and streams. There are plans for
improvement of this road under a proposed Bank-financed rural road project. A
network of provincial roads in Mindoro connects various towns and villages to
the main coastal roads. The situation in Palawan is similar to Mindoro with a
coastal road on the eastern side passing through the project area and connec-
ting it to the provincial capital of Puerto Princesa. The service areas of
each system of the project are provided with acceptable access. The two
islands have sea access to Luzon through ports at Calapan and San Jose in
Mindoro and at Puerto Princesa in Palawan. Daily commercial air service to
Manila is available at the San Jose airport in Mindoro Occidental and Puerto
Princesa airport in Palawan, while Calapan in Mindoro Oriental is served
three times a week.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project proposed for Bank financing would include:
(a) construction of six diversion dams;
(b) construction of irrigation and drainage facilites and roads
on a total area of about 38,000 ha of currently rainfed
lands;
(c) construction of three new division offices and three new
field offices and extension of two existing division
offices and two field offices;
(d) provision of consulting services to assist NIA in design of
the diversion dams and major structures and in the training of
personnel for detailed topographic maps based on up-to-date
aerial photography;
(e) procurement of vehicles and equipment for project implementation
and operation and maintenance; and
(f) strengthening of the malaria control unit of the Ministry of
Health in Palawan.
The project also provides for (a) strengthening the existing NIA input-
output monitorinS' organization and expanding it to cover the national
irrigation systems in the Mindoro Rural Development Project (Loan 1102-PH)
and the project area; and (b) consulting services to evaluate the operation
and maintenance aspects of all national irrigation systems and to develop a
plan for their improvement.
Project Works
3.02      Diversion Dams.  New diversion dams would be built for six of the
seven irrigation systems. Diversion works for the Dulangan system in
Mindoro Oriental were constructed under the Mindoro Rural Development
Project (Loan 1102-PH) by intercepting the flow of the Bayog creek and
conveying it through lateral A of the Baco-Bucayao system to the eastern
bank of the Dulangan river. This lateral would be extended to the western
bank by a siphon 120 m long of 1.2 m dia. The diversion dams would be
ungated concrete weirs, 140-600 m long, and 1-2.0 m high with canal intakes
and sluice-ways. The principal features of the diversion works are
summarized in Table 3.1. A bridge would be provided across the diversion
dam of the Mag-asawang Tubig system in the Mindoro Oriental subproject,
which would serve the service area on both sides of the river and connect the

provincial roads passing through the system.  Existing diversion works of
communal systems within the proposed systems would be improved and
integrated with the project works.
3.03      Irrigation and Drainage Works.  The Mag-asawang Tubig system in
the Mindoro Oriental subproject would be served by two main canals. The
right main canal, 27 km long, would be constructed with a design capacity of
13.0 cu m/sec to supply a service area of 12,500 ha on the right bank. The
remaining area of 2,100 ha on the left bank would be served by the left main
canal, 18 km long, designed to carry 2.2 cu m/sec flow. The first 11 km of
the canals pass through steep topography with a 70 m drop, the right main
canal would be designed with 3 or 4 drops of 15 to 20 m height, which may be
used in the future to produce hydro-electricity. The main canal of the second
system, Bongabon in Mindoro Oriental would be 15 km long and designed to
carry a flow of 8.5 cu m/sec for a 6,000 ha service area.
3.04      The main canals of Mongpong and Caguray systems in Mindoro Occiden-
tal would be 8 km and 16 km long and designed to serve 2,400 ha and 3,400 ha
areas with a flow of 4.3 cu m/sec and 3.0 cu m/sec respectively.  An area of
about 1,500 ha located on the left bank of Mongpong system would be served
by lateral B. This would involve the construction of a siphon 1.5xl.5m size
across the Mongpong river. The Malatgao system in the Palawan subproject
would be served by two main canals. The right main canal, 11.4 km long, would
be constructed with a design capacity of 3.5 cu m/sec to supply a service
area of 2,600 ha on the right bank. An additional area of 250 ha on the
right bank would be served using the existing Taritien-Malatgao communal
irrigation system facilities. The left main canal, 13 km long, would be
constructed with a design capacity of 3.8 cu m/sec to supply a service area
of 2,800 ha on the left bank. The existing Manaili diversion dam of the
communal system would serve an additional area of about 350 ha on the left
bank.  The main canal of the second system, Batang-Batang in Palawan would
be 2.3 km long and designed to carry a flow of about 5.4 cu m/sec for a
4,000 ha service area. A 21 m high drop would be constructed at station
3+300 which may be used in the future to produce hydroelectricity.
3.05      Canals and laterals would be provided with water-regulating and
delivery structures such as checks and turnouts. Main canals and major
laterals with capacities exceeding 1.5 cu m/sec would be provided with water
measuring devices such as Parshall flumes, while laterals and sublaterals of
smaller capacities (less than 1.5 cu m/sec) would have constant head orifice
turnouts as measuring devices. Canals would be unlined except for short
lengths where the soils are erosive.
3.06      The Mag-asawang Tubig river in Mindoro Oriental overflows on both
banks and inundates about 3,000 ha in the lower part of the flood plain. The
area remains under water for about 3 to 5 months, so no wet season crop is
grown in the submerged area. However, a crop is grown during the dry season
from residual soil moisture and some rainfall. The area would be excluded
from the project as the provision of flood protection, involving the
construction of long, 3 to 5 m high dikes, would be uneconomical.



- 15 -
3.07      Gravel surfaced O&M roads would be constructed on the canal and
drain banks. Canals with a design flow greater than 5 cu m/sec, would be
provided with a roadway 5 m wide on both banks, if the service area is
on both sides of the canal, and on one bank, where the service area is on
only one side of the canal. In case of a roadway on both banks, only one
bank would be gravel surfaced. Canals with a capacity between 2 and 5 cu
m/sec would be provided with a 3.5 m wide roadway on one bank.  The roadway
along laterals with capacities less than 2 cu m/second and along some of the
major farm ditches would be a non-gravel, 2.5 m wide cycle or cart path.
However, as no roadway would be built along these waterways if they were
within 200 m of a parallel road, access to the laterals would be provided by
building 3.5 m wide connecting roads 400-500 m apart. About 70 km of 3.5 m
wide access roads would also be provided as links between the existing
and/or proposed major roads of the area and the canal O&M roads, and would
also serve as farm-to-market roads. Gravel surfacing would be provided on
some of the major existing farm-to-market roads. The main and secondary
drains built under the project would be provided with gravel surfaced O&M
roads of 3.5 to 5m width on one bank. The surfacing would be 20 cm thick
for all roadways. To allow continuous passage along the O&M roads, bridges
and/or culverts across the existing drainage channels would be built.
However, on major streams or rivers, the O&M roads would be connected to
existing bridges by short access roads instead of constructing expensive
multi-span bridges.
3.08      The proposed level of on-farm distribution and drainage is similar
to that being implemented in other Bank-assisted projects in the
Philippines. On-farm facilities would be provided for water deliveries to a
rotational area of about 50 ha. Farm turnouts would be provided for each 10
ha unit from which farm ditches, constructed as part of the project, would
convey water directly to most farms. Rice has been grown in the project
area for many years and the land is reasonably level and well laid out with
little fragmentation of land holdings; therefore no land leveling or
boundary realignment would be provided. However, the proposed area for the
Palawan subproject is a 10 year old settlement area which was cleared and
transformed into paddy fields. Settlers abandoned certain parts of the area
and left it uncultivated due to the lack of irrigation . The project would
provide for the clearance of brush land and some land levelling for about
3,200 ha in Palawan and the removal of coconut tree stumps for about 2,500
ha in Mindoro Oriental. Farm drains would convey excess water from each 10
ha unit to the main and secondary drains in flat areas. For more steeply
sloping areas, where the land gradient in the direction of flow is in excess
of 0.4%, the farms would drain from field to field, and consequently the
intensity of farm and collector secondary drains would be somewhat lower.
3.09      Working stations for Water Management Technicians (WMT) would be
built at a ratio of approximately one to each 500 ha of irrigated land in
the project. The stations would provide space for temporary storage and

drying of paddy. Gatekeeper quarters would be constructed at the major
checks and turnouts of main canals and at each diversion dam.
3.10      O&M Buildings.  Five division offices would be established at
Calapan and Roxas covering the Mindoro Oriental systems, at San Jose City
and Santa Cruz covering the Mindoro Occidental systems and at Narra covering
the Palawan systems. The construction of division facilites would include
offices, infirmary, staff quarters, guest house, laboratory facilities,
warehouse and workshop for repairs and maintenance of O&M equipment.
Existing facilities would be expanded at Calapan, Mindoro Oriental and Santa
Cruz, Mindoro Occidental. Three new field offices would be constructed,
which would be located in the town of Victoria in the Mindoro Oriental
subproject, Magsaysay in the Mindoro Occidental subproject and Puefto
Princesa in the Palawan subproject.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.11      All irrigation systems of the project would derive their water
supply from the unregulated flow of separate river sources, using their own
diversion and conveyance system. About 54% of the project area would be
supplied with water during the dry season.
3.12      None of the irrigation systems have any stream gauging at or near
the diversion point, except the Mag-asawang Tubig system in the Mindoro
Oriental subproject. For the four ungauged systems in the two Mindoro
subprojects, the long-term flows at each diversion point were developed by
using the streamflow of nearby river basins of similar physical character-
istics and adjusting them on an area basis.  Stream flow data of the
Mag-asawang Tubig and Baco-Bucayao rivers were used for the Bongabon and
Dulangan systems, the Bugsuanga river for the Caguray system and the
Mamburao river for the Mongpong system. The stream flow data for the two
systems in Palawan were generated using a rainfall-runoff relation developed
from the data of river basins in the nearby islands of Negros and Panay
which have similar physical characteristics and sizes. Short-term streamflow
data were extended back to 1949 and up to 1977 by the use of rainfall
records. The generated streamflows were found to be in reasonable agreement
with the concurrent actual streamflows wherever available. For those
systems, which have stream gauges located downstream of the diversion point,
the available stream flows were adjusted for upstream withdrawals. The
Dulangan system would utilize the excess flow of the Baco-Bucayao system
during the wet season and and additional water is expected from the spring
flowing into Bayog creek. A minimum flow of 1.0 cu m/sec was assumed on the
basis of 2.0 cu m/sec minimum flow observed from the two year record of
measurements of the Bayog creek at the point of the intercepting structure
built on lateral A of the Baco-Bucayao system.

3.13      Design Floods.  Flood frequency curves were developed for rivers
with adequate data in Mindoro island. For the systems in Palawan and those
with inadequate stream flow data in Mindoro, a regional flood frequency curve
was developed using streamflow and rainfall data from river basins in
Mindoro, Negros and Panay islands. Peak flood discharge with recurrence
frequency of 50 years would be used for the design of the diversion dams.
3.14      Water Demand.  Water requirements for the project were based on two
rice crops per year. It was assumed that transplanted rice using 120-day
non-photosensitive varieties in both the wet and dry seasons would be the
dominant crop in the project. Water requirements for rice in the three
subproject areas were based on the cropping calendar shown in Figure 5.1.
3.15      Rice land preparation and nursery were estimated to take 30 days
with water requirements for saturation, evaporation and percolation as shown
in Table 3.2. Flooding requirements to provide a minimum depth of water in
the field for cultivations in each season were estimated to be 20 mm
immediately after transplanting, followed by additional 50 mm about two
weeks later. Field percolation losses were estimated to be 2.5 mm/day in
Mindoro and 2.0 mm/day in Palawan. Evapo-transpiration rates were taken to
be equal to the computed evaporation rate, using the Penman method or the
observed class A pan evaporation, and effective rainfall was determined from
observed daily rainfall records and allowing water depth to fluctuate with
the growth of the rice plants and limiting maximum depth to 150 mm. The
overall irrigation efficiency was assumed to be 43% in the wet season and
50% in the dry season at full development, based on farm irrigation wastes
of 40% in the wet season and 30% in the dry season.
3.16      Seasonal and total annual diversion requirements are developed in
Table 3.2. Monthly water requirements of the three subprojects are shown in
Annex 5. Monthly water requirements and average river flows for all the
systems are shown in Table 3.3. Annual diversion requirements are estimated
to vary between subproject areas from 2.7 m to 2.4 m of which 1.1 m to 1.9 m
would be required in the dry season. The size of the irrigated area for
each system was determined using synthesized discharge records for the
27-year period 1948-75, and the estimated seasonal water requirements for
rice. The cropping calendar was chosen to maximize the use of rainfall
without exceeding local manpower constraints. No use of return flow was
assumed. Adequate water supply is available to meet the supplementary
irrigation demand of each system during the wet season. About 21,300 ha can
be irrigated during the dry season in the three subproject areas. The
currently irrigated areas and the irrigable areas selected for development
under the project are summarized below and given in detail for each system
in Table 3.4.

Although the future irrigable area for each system in the project was deter-
mined taking into account the water rights of existing users, assurances
were obtained from Government that the necessary water rights for both
existing and expanded areas would be granted to NIA and no other rights
except for domestic use which could adversely affect the project water
supply would be granted except by mutual agreement with the Bank.
3.17      Water Quality.  Tests of water samples taken from streams near the
proposed location of each system indicate good water quality with total
dissolved solids under 400 ppm. The waters are of low salinity, slightly
alkaline (pH 7-8) and free of toxic elements.
Status of Engineering
3.18      Project planning studies, designs and cost estimates for the
irrigation and drainage systems and associated works were carried out by
NIA. The basic layouts were prepared using 1:4,000 scale topographic maps
with 1.0 m contour interval. Strip surveys were made to prepare plans and
profiles of main and lateral canals and major drains for determining
construction quantities. Six sample areas, one in each system, of about
50-300 ha were used for the detailed layout of drainage and on-farm facil-
ities. The costs of drains and on-farm facilities were based on unit
quantity estimates for each item of work per meter for the drains and per
hectare for the on-farm facilities. These were obtained from sample areas
applicable to a particular system, for which designs were prepared.

Requirements for structures were determined according to basic irrigation
design practices. Operation and maintenance roads were based on canal
capacity and needs within the service area, and were checked in the field to
ensure that adequate access to project works would be provided. The
planning and design of the sample areas has been carried out in sufficient
detail to allow the rapid completion of final design and plans for the first
year of construction by June 1980. Sufficient investigations have been made
to ensure that suitable materials are available for construction of canal
embankments and maintenance roadways.
3.19      The topographic maps of 1:4,000 scale used in the sample area
studies were prepared by conventional ground survey methods. The
topographic maps of the service area on a scale of 1:4,000 would be prepared
using recent aerial photographs and the spot height identification survey
method. These maps would be used for detail planning and design of on-farm
facilities, as well as the distribution and drainage systems. NIA would
employ a consultant for a total period of about two years, in four to six
assignments of two to six months for the duration of the project, to assist
in the preparation of the maps and to train NIA survey personnel in new and
advanced survey procedures and photogrammetry. Provision would be made for
about 25 man-months of consulting services at an overall rate of US$8,000
per man-month, consisting of a billing rate of US$6,000 per man-month,
international travel expenses of US$800 per man-month, and local expenses of
US$1,200 per man-month.
3.20      Detail foundation investigation are underway for finalizing the
location of diversion dams and NIA expects to complete the design of
diversion structures for Bongabon, Caguray and Malatgao systems before
September 1980. NIA would employ consultants to review the foundation data,
hydrology, location and assist in the design of all diversion dams and other
major structures such as the drops in Mag-asawang Tubig and Batang Batang
systems and siphon across the Mongpong river. The project provides for
about 45 man-months of consulting services at an overall rate of US$10,000
per man-month, consisting of a billing rate (including home-office overhead)
of US$8,000 per man-month, international travel expenses of US$800 per
man-month, and local expenses of US$1,200 per man-month. Assurances have
been obtained that the consultants to be employed by NIA for assistance in
the design of the diversion dams and for the assistance in advanced survey
procedures and photogrammetry (para. 3.19), would be under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
3.21      Construction of the irrigation and drainage system would begin in
early 1981 with preconstruction activities starting in the middle of 1980
(see Figure 3.1). All project works are expected to be completed by
end-1985.

Input-Output Monitoring
3.22      The NIA is currently constructing and/or rehabilitating about
320,000 ha with Bank Group assistance and if the proposed project and the
completed Upper Pampanga River Project (UPRP) are included, this would
amount to 450,000 ha, providing a livelihood for about 240,000 families.  If
these projects are to be successful when NIA has completed their construc-
tion, besides attaining the projected cropping intensities, farmers must
reach the projected paddy yields of about 4.0 ton/ha. To do this on a
sustained basis, farmers must receive a sufficient and timely supply of farm
inputs, such as credit, seed, fertilizer, pesticide, labor, threshing and
drying facilities, and transport and marketing services. If these inputs do
not reach the farmers, the success of the entire NIA irrigation program
could be threatened.
3.23      A program of input-output monitoring was established under the
Chico River Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH) with the objectives of (a)
monitoring the flow and build-up of farm inputs in each project area before
and during each crop season, to give NIA sufficient warning of any shortfall
and allow it to take appropriate action; and (b) monitoring the size and the
recipients of benefit flows in each project area. This program has been in
operation in the UPRP service area for about three years, with useful
results. It was extended under the National Irrigation Systems Improvement
Project II (Loan 1526-PH) to the systems of NISIP I and II. The monitoring
personnel are under training, and a five-year agricultural development plan
for the chosen systems is being finalized.  It would be desirable to extend
this program to the systems of the l4indoro Rural Development Project (Loan
1102-PH) and the proposed project.
3.24      The program would be implemented in three phases.  Phase I, during
the first two years of project implementation, would cover the training of
monitoring personnel and preparation of five-year agricultural development
plans. Phase 2, extending over a period of two years, would implement
monitoring procedures on the Baco-Bucayao system of the Mlindoro Rural
Development Project. In Phase 3, the program would be extended to cover the
Pula river Irrigation System in Mfindoro Oriental and a minimum of three
systems, one in each subproject area during the last three years of the
implementation period. The program would be implemented under the direction
of the Farmers' Assistance Department of NIA who would coordinate closely
with the National Food and Agricultural Council (NFAC). The project
provides for 30 man-months of local consultants at an average cost of
US$3,000 per man-month to assist NIA in both the input and output monitoring
phases of the program.
O&M Study and Training
3.25      It is expected that by 1985, NIA would have about 800,000 ha of
upgraded national irrigation systems under operation. With the completion
of major irrigation development, NIA has to change its enphasis from



- 24 -
construction to operations and maintenance. The Government has requested
Bank-financed assistance in the preparation of a study which would evaluate
the present situation and develop a plan of action for improving the
operation and maintenance of all national irrigation systems. The project
provides for about 45 man-months of consulting services to assist NIA at an
overall rate of US$10,000 per man-month, consisting of a billing rate
(including home-office overhead) of US$8,000 per man-month, international
travel expenses of US$800 per man-month, and local expenses of US$1,200 per
man-month. Assurances have been obtained that NIA would prepare terms of
reference and an outline of the study to be financed under the present loan
and, after review by the Bank, that it would carry out the study with the
assistance of consultants, under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank. Funds would also be provided under the project for about 30 study
tours and training scholarships of three to five weeks duration in neighbor-
ing countries with projects of similar nature and about six post graduate
scholarships for one or two years duration. The scholarships and study tours
would be for the benefit of NIA staff working on design, construction,
operation and maintenance, input-output monitoring and agricultural aspects
of irrigation projects.
Strengthening of Malaria Control Unit in Palawan
3.26      Malaria is the leading disease in Palawan.  In the project area it
ranks second among the ten leading causes of morbidity and is a major factor
in reducing farm labor productivity. On average, incidence has been of about
50 cases per thousand population in the last 3 years. While malaria is also
present in the province of Occidental Mindoro, it is not endemic in any of
the project systems. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has an ongoing program of
malaria control in Palawan consisting of passive case detection, biological
control, chemotherapy and residual spraying of houses. However, due to lack
of financial resources and trained personnel the results have been discour-
aging. The major problems encountered have been inadequate coverage and
little cooperation of the local population. Some of the P. falciparum
strains are resistant to chloroquin treatment.
3.27      The project envisages a provision of US$400,000 to strengthen the
Malaria Control Unit in Palawan during a five year period. To achieve this,
the unit would concentrate its operations in the municipalities of Narra and
Aborlan, where the two project systems are located, and would carry out the
following major activities:
(a)  increase the residual spraying of houses to twice a year;
(b)  carry out weekly larvicide applications in selected breeding places;
(c)  expand biological control measures in selected areas; and
(d)  reinforce surveillance operations and enlist community acceptance
of program implementation through information campaigns.



- 25 -
3.28      The Malaria Eradication Service of MOH which is responsible for
monitoring and control of the disease in the affected area would direct the
program under the project. The field unit in Palawan is understaffed and
lacks logistical support facilities. The project would provide field labs,
equipment and vehicles and increased personnel. A separate control team
covering the two municipalities and based in Narra would be headed by a
senior malariologist with appropriate supporting personnel. Because of a
limited tenure of five years and location it is difficult for MOH to attract
qualified personnel at the Government civil service salaries. To overcome
this problem the personnel used by the project would be paid by NIA. An
assurance has been obtained that NIA and MOH would enter an agreement
acceptable to the Bank by December 31, 1980, for the implementation of the
malaria control component of the project. Provision would also be made
under the project for an information campaign to alert the population to the
dangers of the disease and to supply information on prevention and
treatment.
Cost Estimates
3.29      Total project costs are estimated at US$118.5 million, of which
US$55.3 million or 47% is foreign exchange. Project costs are based on
quantity estimates for feasibility designs and unit prices prevailing in the
Bank-assisted irrigation projects in mid-1980 adjusted to conditions in the
three subproject areas. Unit prices for equipment, materials and supplies
are based on recent quotations received by NIA. The Government exempts NIA
from paying taxes or duties for equipment, material and services procured
under foreign-assisted projects, so all the costs exclude such taxes. NIA's
costs for design and construction supervision are included under engineering.
All costs are indexed to a common level mid-1980, and this is the base cost
level for the project. A physical contingency factor of 15% was used for
all works. Costs due to expected price increases over the implementation
period amount to about 39% of the base cost plus physical contingencies,
assuming the following inflation rates:

Financing
3.31      The proposed Bank loan of US$71 million would cover 60% of the
total project costs and finance the full foreign exchange cost of the
project and about US$ 15.7 million of the local project costs. The
Government would provide the remaining P 351 million (US$47.5 million) to
NIA from annual budget appropriations.
Procurement
3.32      Equipment, vehicles, spare parts and supplies would be procured
after international competitive bLidding in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. A preference limited to 15%- of the c.i.f. price of imported
goods, or the customs duty, whichever is lower would be extended to local
marnufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Local procurement practices are
appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$20,000 each because
the advantages of international competitive bidding would be clearly
outweighed by the administrative costs involved. The total cost of such
items would not exceed US$400,000. Bank staff have reviewed the local
procedures and they are acceptable. There is adequate competition and
foreign firms can participate. A list of equipment requirements is given in
Annex 1.
3.33      Construction of the diversion dams, intake works and main canals
for the two irrigation systems in Mindoro Oriental (US$15.0 million) would
be the only project works suitable for international competitive bidding.
The remaining works on the project service area (US$45.0 million) would be
scattered over seven separate locations in three different provinces and two
islands. They would include the construction of laterals, sublaterals,
drainage system, access and service roads, on-farm facilities and OI
buildings for seven systems of the project, as well as the diversion dams,
intake structures and main canals of the four systems in Mindoro Occidental
and Palawan. In the case of Mindoro Rural Development Project (Loan 1102-PH),
NIA has experienced considerable difficulty in attracting bids for such
works and about 70% of the total works in that project are being implemented
by force account. Therefore, some civil works construction would be carried
out by force account. In previous Bank-financed irrigation projects, the
amount of civil works to be done by force account was limited to 40% of the
total cost, as lower limits were found to be unrealistic. An assurance has
been obtained that NIA would ensure that the aggregate amount of civil works
done by force account wiould not exceed 40% of the total cost of civil works
excluding those subject to ICB. Competitive bidding in accordance with
local procedures is appropriate for the balance of the work. Bank staff
have reviewed the local procedures and they are acceptable. There is
adequate competition and foreign firms can participate.

Disbursements
3.34      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment and 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and 65% for imported equipment
procured locally.  Disbursement for civil works would be 55% of certified
monthly progress payments or expenditures.  Disbursement for force account
works would be made against certificates of expenditure; the documentation
for works would show the quantities of major items of works accomplished and
the expenditure would be based on agreed unit rates. NIA would submit a
detailed unit rate analysis with supporting documents for Bank review before
December 31, 1980, and whenever any change in the unit rates is desired.
Disbursement for minor contracts (less than P 1 million) would also be
made against certificates of expenditure based on actual payments made to
contractors. The borrower would make available all documents related to the
force account expenditure for inspection by the Bank's supervision mission.
The project offices of NIA have the staffing and institutional capability to
provide such documentation in a satisfactory manner (Annex 4). For civil
works, contractors' mobilizatioa and equipment, disbursement would be at the
rate of 100% of foreign expenditare.  For consulting services and technical
assistance, disbursements would be at the rate of 100% of total costs.
3.35      It is expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31,
1986, approximately one year after the end of construction. An estimated
schedule of expenditures, a sem-.-qnnual disbursement schedule and a proposed
allocation of loan proceeds are given in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audit
3.36      The NIA is a Government agency and its accounts are audited
annually by the Government's Commission on Audit. Assurances have been
obtained that NIA would maintain separate accounts for the project and that
after audit by the Commission on Audit, the project accounts, together with
the auditors' comments and opinion on the certification of expenditure for
force account work, would be sen- to the Bank within six months of the close
of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.37      The principal health p-oblems in all three areas are protein
deficiencies in small children, enteric diseases and tuberculosis. The
proposed project would have little impact on these. The proposed drainage
works for the Mag-asawang Tubig system in the Mindoro Oriental subproject
would have a beneficial effect on the Schistosomiasis-infested areas of the
system. The area is also covere, bv the Schistosomiasis health control
program under the Mindoro Rural Development Project (Loan 1102-PH). Malaria
is prevalent in Palawan and parts of Mindoro. The Government program of
house spraying with residual insecticides is effective in Mindoro.  The
strengthening of the Malaria Control Unit in Palawan (para. 3.26) would help
to reduce the incidence of malaria in Palawan.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project IIanagement
4.01      NIA was created in 1964 and given responsibilities for developing,
operating and maintaining all national irrigation systems in the
Philippines. The Government finances NIA through the sale of bonds or from
appropriations. The agency is presided over by a board of directors; the
Administrator, who is appointed by the President of the Philippines, is
responsible for operations and management. NIA has recently been
reorganized in order to improve its capacity to deal with the requirements
of the Government's policy of irrigation development. The major foreign
assisted projects were previously under a Special Projects Organization
(SPO) headed by an Assistant Administrator who handled all project aspects
such as implementation, operation and maintenance and finances. Under the
new reorganization four Assistant Administrators handle these aspects.
However, the most crucial aspects of the implementation dealing with design,
procurement, and construction would be handled by the Assistant
Administrator for Development and Implementation. NIA is currently
responsible for 20 foreign-assisted major projects and has built up a
structure of staff which, with specialist consultant input where necessary,
is competent to implement large-scale projects.
4.02      NIA intends to use the Director of the Mindoro Rural Development
Project (Loan 1102-PH) as Project Manager of the proposed project. The Di-
rector is a senior NIA employee who was closely involved in the formulation
and preparation of the proposed project. The Rural Development Project is
approaching coiapletion and will, therefore, make fewer demands on his time.
The project area would be divided into five construction divisions, two in
Mindoro Oriental centered around Calapan and Roxas, two in Mindoro
Occidental centered on Santa Cruz and San Jose and one in Palawan centered
on Narra (Figure 4.2). The Project Manager would be assisted at the field
level by the five Project Engineers, one assigned to each division.
4.03      For O&M purposes, the entire project area of about 37,800 ha would
be administered by a single project manager (Figure 4.3). There would be
six support divisions, dealing with administration, accounting, equipment,
engineering, operations and agricultural aspects. The project area would be
divided into five Irrigation Districts with centers in Calapan, Roxas, Santa
Cruz, San Jose and Narra. Each district would be divided into 50 ha irriga-
tion units.  A ditchtender would manage two such units (100 ha), while a
Water Management Technician (WMT) would supervise five ditchtenders (500 ha).
A supervisor would be responsible for a water management division which
includes five WIfT's (2,500 ha). Two to five divisions would constitute a
zone under a superintendent. The Calapan District would have two zones and
there would be one zone in each of the remaining four districts.
4.04      At completion of the construction, about 76 WMTs would be required.
Most of the technicians would be newly recruited graduates in agriculture or
in agricultural engineering, although some may be promoted from the ranks of
competent and experienced ditchtenders. All tWMTs, whether directly recruited



- 32 -
or promoted to the post, would undergo a one-year training program in water
management, crop production and farmer organization at the training center
at Iloilo established under the Jalaur Irrigation Project (Loan 1367-PHl).
4.05      The malaria control program would be supervised from Manila by a
specialist from the Malaria Eradication Service (MIES) in the Ministry of
Health (MOH).  Actual implementation of the program would be undertaken by
the MES's field personnel in Palawan which would be strengthened under the
project. NIA would procure the equipment and supplies and pay the services
of additional personnel employed by Ml0T under a special memorandum of
agreement between NIA and MOH.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.06      Extension.  The National Food and Agricultural Council (NFAC) is
responsible for coordinating the activities of all agencies involved in food
crop production and is the body overseeing the implementation of the Masagana
campaign for increased rice production. The coordinating function of NFAC
at the level of individual irrigation systems woujld be carried out by the
provincial and municipal action committees. The number of farmers per
extension worker averages about 105 in the project systems. The technicians
are all graduates and come mainly from the Bureau of Agriculture Extension
(BAE) and the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Other technicians active in some, if not all, irrigation systems are from thte
Bureau of Soils, the Philippine National Bank, the Farm Systems Development
Corporation (FSDC) and the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR). The Ministry
of Agriculture is in the process of reorganizing the extension service and
improving its efficiency throughout the Philippines with Bank assistance
(Loan 1626-PH). The water management staff (para. 4.04) would be additional
to the existing extension personnel provided by the various Government
agencies.
4.07      Research.  In addition to the central research facilities provided
by the College of Agriculture of the University of the Philippines, the
International Rice Research Institute at Los Banos, and the BPI Maligaya Rice
Experiment Station in Nueva Ecija province there are several research
substations in the project area. The BPI conducts applied research in rice
variety trials and multiple cropping from a station in Victoria, Mindoro
Oriental and supports variety, fertilizer and multiple cropping trials in
Narra, Palawan in cooperation with the Japanese Overseas Cooperative Volun-
teers and the Palawan National Agricultural College at Aborlan. The Bureau
of Soils has soil laboratories in Palawan and Mindoro Occidental but they
are not completely equipped. The Bureau of Agricultural Extension operates
a regional demonstration and training center at Barcenaga. Mindoro Oriental.
4.08      Seed. At present the average seeding rate in the project area is
about 90 kg/ha with some farmers using as much as 120 kg/ha mainly because
of poor germination, damage to seedlings at transplant:ng, arid drought.  As
a result, a total of about 3,600 tons o. rice seed is required each year, most
of it is obtained by retention of or-farm production, though it is not
uncommon for farmers to purchlse seed from registered growers or from other



- 33 -
farmers wrho grow tlLe desired variety. In the future, assuming an assured
supply of high quality seed and water, it is estimated that the average
seeding rate will be about 50-60 kg/ha which implies that the project area
will require about 3,000 tons of seed annually. Assuming a replacement of
seeds every four seasons the average annual requirement of certified seeds
would be about 1,500 tons, in order to meet these requirements about 450 ha
would have to be devoted to certified seed production each cropping season.
No difficulties are foreseen in the distribution of seed or the establishment
of registered growers. Farmers in all three subprojects are well informed on
the new improved varieties and their characteristics, and readily purchase
the output of registered seed growers. Some improvements will be required
in the testing and certification of the seed growers' output. The seed
analysis laboratory in Mindoro Oriental, though not yet fully equipped, will
institute testing of seed produced by registered growers and help to
accelerate the distribution of high quality seed to farmers.
4.09      Fertilizer.  Present annual consumption of fertilizer in the three
subproject areas is about 1,000 tons in Palawan, 2,200 tons in Mlindoro
Oriental, and about 1,700 tons in Mindoro Occidental.  The nost conmonly
used fojriiulatiorls are urea, ammonium phosphate, 14-14-14 and sinilar
comapounds.  Ammonium sulphate is widely used in Mindoro Oriental.  Appli-
cation rates vary from 50 kg/ha or less in some rainfed areas subject to
flooding to 200-250 kg on better farms with reliable irrigation. Farmers
often use coTmpound fertilizers such as 14-14-14 due to ready availability,
lack of proper recommendations, and the belief that it is cheaper.
At full development it is expected that urea would be the major source of
nitrogen and triple superphosphate would be the phosphoric acid source.
Potassium is not considered necessary in the project areas. In terms of
nutrients, the average application per hectare for each crop would be about
80 kg of nitrogen and 40 kg of phosphoric acid in Mindoro Oriental and
Palawan. In Mindoro Occidental only nitrogen would be required at a rate of
80 kg per hectare. Annual fertilizer requirements at full development in
the project area would be about 10,000 tons of urea and 4,200 tons of
triple-superphosphate. The existing fertilizer distribution network is
adequate and could be easily expanded to neet increased demand in the future.
4.10      Agrochemicals.  Agrochemicals are readily available in the project
area and are widely used in nodest quantities. Survey results show that about
80% of the rainfed area and over 90%, of the irrigated area receive some
pesticide application. Average application rates are 0.6 qt/ha on rainfed
paddy and about 1 qt/ha on irrigated paddy. Farmers are also well-acquainted
with herbicides and about 50% of the rainfed areas and 60% of the irrigated
areas receive herbicide applications averaging 0.7 qt/ha.  Serious outbreaks
of insect pest and disease infestations are not common.  Extensive rat danage
has been reported for most systems at one time or another over the past 5
years. A rodent control component is included in the BPI-Cerman Surveillance
Programi which, armong other activities, trains plant pest control officers.
For the future the application rates of agrochemicals are not expected to
increase. Future demand of agroclhemicals due to increased area will he
easily r,wtt from existing sources within the subproject areas.



- 34 -
4.11      Farmers' Organizations.  As part of the Agrarian Reform program,
the Government, through the Ministry of Local Government and Community
Development (MLGCD), is promoting the formation of pre-cooperative farmer
organizations, based on a barrio or hamlet. The organizations would serve
as channels for the inflow of technical services, credit and inputs and as
assembly points for produce intended for markets. It is expected that these
organizations will eventually grow into full-fledged, formally constituted
cooperatives. This approach to cooperative organization fits in well with
the NIA effort to set up irrigators' associations based initially on the 50
ha irrigation units.
4.12      Credit.  Under the Masagana program the Government has eased
credit to small farmers, previously dependent on the landlords and private
lenders for their requirements. A system of uncollateralized "supervised
credit" is used, which includes the provision of technical services to the
borrower to ensure that recommended practices, such as variety, fertilizer
and agrochemical inputs are adopted. The Masagana credit program has run
into difficulties as a result of poor repayment of previous loans and is now
being reviewed by the Government with a view to devising means of overcoming
the current problems. Within the project area Masagana loans have been
provided to about 20% of the farmers. The mean size of loan was P1l,100/ha
or P 3,150 per farm. At full development it is assumed that 50% of the
farmers in the project area, covering about 60% of the land, would require
credit from official sources at the current maximum rate of P 1,400/ha.
On this basis, the annual requirements for the project area would be about
P 45 million (US$6.0 million) of which P 30 million for the wet season
and P 15 million for the dry season crop.

5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Pattern
5.01      In most of the project systems land preparation for the first or wet
season rice crop begins in May or June and transplanting is usually completed
by July, while the harvesting is done between November and January. The
second or dry season crop extends from December to June. The cropping
calendar for rainfed paddy is dependent on the arrival of the southwest mon-
soon which can vary by a month or more from year to year. A rainfed crop is
planted in the second season in parts of the Mindoro Oriental subproject,
usually in December or January. Almost all project land, whether irrigated or
rainfed, is planted to high yielding varieties. In the project area seedlings
are transplanted from field nurseries onto puddled fields. In addition to
rice, which is by far the most important crop in the area, there are small
areas of corn and tobacco and about 2,500 ha of old and low yielding coco-
nuts. All of these areas are expected to be cropped under rice once irriga-
tion is provided.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.02      In the absence of the project, significant changes in the cropping
patterns are not expected. The new irrigation facilities of the project
would permit the expansion of the irrigable area in the wet season from
3,100 ha to 37,800 ha. In the dry season the irrigation facilities and
better water management would increase the irrigated rice area from about
2,100 ha to 20,300 ha, thereby raising the overall cropping intensity from
106% to 154%. The greatest improvement in cropping patterns would be in
Palawan where about 3,200 ha of currently uncultivated land would be converted
to paddy fields.
Yields and Production
5.03      Without the project yields in the rainfed areas would increase at
about 0.8% per year, and at 1.0% per year in the presently irrigated areas.
These yield increases would be induced by an improved transportation infra-
structure, better availability of inputs and more effective extension ser-
vices. Improved yields with the project would be due mainly to a reliable
supply of water on the presently rainfed areas, together with better access to
institutional credit and inputs and improved extension service support.
Present and projected paddy yields are shown in Table 5.1. The projected
yields are already being surpassed by good farmers in the area, with reliable
water supplies. As a result of the project, paddy production would increase
from about 52,000 tons at present to an estimated 227,000 tons at full project
development in 1990 (Table 5.2). Lower yields have been projected for Palawan
than for Mindoro in consideration of the managerial difficulties involved in
changing from extensive rainfed cropping to a highly intensive irrigated rice
cultivation on the larger farms that exist in the area.

Cropping Calendar
5.04      The achievement of maximum benefits from irrigation is dependent on
strict adherence to a cropping calendar. A closely followed cropping calendar
also minimizes technical and organizational bottlenecks and facilitates
effective extension and water management. Calendars have been developed for
each of the sytems and are shown in Figure 5.1. Minor shifts are made from
existing practices to obtain maximum benefit from the available water and to
avoid harvest in months of heavy rain. The greatest adjustment is made in
Mindoro Oriental where the current calendar is brought forward by about two
months to maximize the dry season irrigable area. Typhoon damage to standing
crops is uncommon in the project area and therefore modifications in the
cropping calendars to avoid typhoon damage were not necessary.
Farm Mechanization
5.05      At present mechanized land preparation on the individual systems
ranges from less than 10% to about 50%-60%, and for the project as a whole it
is about 20%. The use of machines is more widespread in irrigated areas due
to higher farm incomes, easier access to institutional credit and the need for
tighter scheduling of operations. Both four-wheel (40-60 h.p.) and two-wheel
(8-15 h.p.) tractors are used. With the requirement for tighter scheduling,
better access, and increased cropping intensities in the future, it is esti-
mated that about 80% of land preparation would be done mechanically. Most of
the machinery would be owned by farmers and contracted out to neighbors. Some
equipment would be Government owned, such as the machinery operated by the MAR
Resettlement Unit at Narra, Palawan.
5.06      Manual harvesting by sickle is expected to continue in the future in
the entire project area. At present mechanized threshing is common throughout
the project area, ranging from 25% in some rainfed areas of Palawan to over
90% on the larger systems with existing irrigation on Mindoro. Overall about
75% of the harvest is threshed mechanically. Mechanized threshing is proj-
ected to increase in the future to cover 85% of the harvest. Current
threshing contract rates of 6%-7% of the volume harvested are assumed to
prevail in the future.
Drying Storage and Processing
5.07      Depending on weather conditions, harvested paddy may be allowed to
dry in the field for a day or two before threshing. After threshing the paddy
is sun dried on whatever suitable surface is available before being stored at
home or carried to market. A few portable mechanical dryers belonging to the
National Grains Authority (NGA) are in operation in Mindoro Oriental which
has an extended rainy season. Most of the larger rice mills have concrete
drying floors. Major NGA milling/storage centers have drying floors and
limited mechanical drying facilities. Existing drying arrangements are gene-
rally adequate for Palawan and Mindoro Occidental, but would require improve-
ment in Mindoro Oriental where difficulties are encountered due to excessively



- 39 -
wet paddy. For the future, additional drying capacity would be required in
all three project provinces. For Palawan and Mindoro Occidental, solar drying
would meet all needs, while in Mindoro Oriental some artificial drying
capability would be required because of the wetter climate.
5.08      Present storage capacity is adequate in the Palawan and Mindoro
Occidental subproject areas, but deficient in Mindoro Oriental. NGA plans to
increase the storage capacity in each subproject area over the next few years
to meet the projected production increase of 175,000 tons. Both the private
sector and the NGA are expected to make the necessary investments to accom-
modate the increased production. In the project municipalities there are
about 200 mills and hullers with a total annual capacity of over 300,000
tons of paddy, more than enough to handle the present area production of
about 270,000 tons. The milling capacity is evenly distributed throughout
the project area. In the future, however, incremental milling capacity
would be required to process the estimated additional 175,000 tons of paddy
to be generated by the project. No difficulties are anticipated in the
provision of expanded milling facilities since the private sector is
enterprising and has access to development financing earmarked for this type
of investment.

6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      A major Goverment objective has been to increase rice production
as a means of raising the incomes of small farmers and of attaining national
self-sufficiency in food grains. After experiencing substantial deficits in
the early 1970s, rice production grew by 5% p.a. during crop years 1974-77
and the Philippines was able to provide for consumption solely from domestic
production during the crop years 1975-77. In 1977/78, the Government
exported 90,000 tons and built up a supply of about three months. The 1978
end-of year stock held by the Government was about 260,000 tons and for 1979
it is expected to reach 400,000 tons. The good performance in the past
three years has been due mainly to an increase in yields brought about by
favorable weather. With the continued growth of population and incomes, the
demand for rice is expected to rise by about 3.0% annually. Based on a
projected growth of 3.7% in production and with average weather conditions,
the Philippines is expected to achieve sustained self-sufficiency by 1982
and to have a surplus of between 350,000 and 375,000 tons by 1990. With a
continuing effort to improve rice quality, the Philippines should have no
difficulty in exporting this surplus.
6.02      Mindoro and Palawan islands presently produce about 280,000 tons
of paddy in excess of their requirements. The surplus is mainly sold in
Southern Luzon and the Eastern Visayas. About 2,400 tons of project area
paddy were exported overseas in 1978 and it is expeced that about 16,000
tons will be exported in 1979. At full development a total surplus of about
450,000 tons of paddy, would have to be sold outside the islands of Palawan
and Mindoro. Most of it would continue to go to the Eastern Visayas and
Southern Luzon and some increases in overseas exports can be expected, as
quality of the product improves.
Prices
6.03      Since 1957, the Government has set an annual farm-gate support
price for paddy to encourage production and allow some purchases of paddy by
Government to build stabilization stocks. Responsibility for operating the
system through purchases in the market is vested in a statutory body, the
National Grains Authority (NGA). Through 1972, the farm-gate support price
for paddy and the domestic consumer price for rice kept pace with changes in
the world market price for rice.  Between 1972 and 1975, to keep domestic
prices down in the face of record high world market prices for rice, the
Government subsidized consumers by maintaining a low official ceiling price
for rice and a correspondingly low farm-gate price for paddy by sales of
imported rice on the domestic market below cost. Since 1975, the official
support price and the import parity prices have been practically the same.



- 41 -
6.04      According to the Bank's commodity price forecasts, the world
market price of Thai 5% broken rice is expected to rise (in constant mid-1980
prices) from US$430/ton f.o.b. Bangkok in 1980 to US$504/ton in 1990. The
quality of rice likely to be exported by the Philippines in the mid-1980s is
25-35% broken, which historically trades at a 30% discount from the price of
5% broken rice. On this basis, the world market price of Thai 25-35% broken
is expected to rise from US$270/ton in 1980 to US$350/ton in 1990. The
economic and financial paddy farm-gate price calculations are shown in
Table 6.1 for 1980 and 1990, the-year full development is reached.

Farm Incomes
6.06      Farm incomes have been prepared for Mindoro and Palawan showing the
most prevalent farm size in each area, representing the present condition of a
rainfed farm and showing how these farms would develop in the future with the
project. No farm model for presently irrigated land has been presented
since such lands are less than 10% of the total project area and never
surpass 15% of the area of any single subproject. The farm models are
summarized below and presented in detail in Annex 2.
Table 6.3: FARM INCOMES

Palawan: rice      5.0    3,450   22,700    465    3,070        2,605      430
6.07      The above farm models represent owner-operated farms which, after
completion of the land reform program, would represent 40% of the farms and
55% of the land. The remaining farms would be operated by leaseholders and,
after rent payment, the respective annual incomes on these farms at full



- 43 -
development would be lower than that from an owner-operated farm by from
about US$600 for a 2.5 ha farm in Mindoro, to US$1,290 for a 5.0 ha farm in
Palawan. Furthermore, in the initial phases of the project, some of the
owner-operators would still have to make payments for land acquired under
the land reform, and thus their incomes would be less than the figures shown
above.
6.08      For 2.5 ha farms, the average farmi size in the Ilindoro subproject,
the present per capita incomes range from US$35 for an amortizing owner on a
rice farm to US$80 for an owner-operator on a coconut farm. These incomes
are well below the per capita absolute poverty level of UJS$200 and vary from
6% to 13% of the estimated 1980 per capita GNP of US$600 for the
Philippines. With the project, the per capita incomes of these farms would
range from about US$195 for a leaseholder to US$295 for an owner-operator.
The leaseholders would almost reach the absolute poverty level while
owner-operators would surpass it by almost 50%. These incomes would still
range from 20 to 30% of the 1990 projected per capita GNP of US$975.
6.09      In Palawan, where the average farm size is 5 ha, present per capita
incomes vary between US$35 for an amortizing owner to US$80 for an owner-
operator, also substantially below the absolute poverty level. With the
project, per capita incomes would range from US$295 for leaseholders to
US$510 for owner-operators. Incomes of these farmers would, therefore, rise
above the 1980 absolute poverty level and range between 30 and 50% of the
projected 1990 per capita GNP.
6.10      These comparisons indicate that the project would increase incomes
of a large number of poor farmers in the project area and would help narrow
the income gap between the project area and other parts of the country, and
between urban and rural areas.
Cost and Rent Recovery
6.11      NIA has the authority to collect fees from users of irrigation
systems to finance operations and to reimburse construction fees.
Irrigation charges on national systems other than those which are assisted
by the Bank are 2.0 cavans (100 kg) of paddy/ha in the wet season and 3.0
cavans/na (150 kg) in the dry season. On Bank-assisted projects, the charge
of 3.5 cavans (175 kg) of paddy/ha in the wet season and 4.4 cavans (220 kg)
in the dry season, is to be achieved gradually over five years from
conpletion of construction.
6.12      Based on the above water charges, the rent recovery index was
examined for different farm tenures, types and locations. Indices have been
presented for owner-operated and leaseholder-operated 2.5 ha rice and
coconut farms in Mindoro and for 5 ha rice farms in Palawan.  The incre-
mental rent recovery index for the project beneficiaries ranges from 15% for
an owner-operator on a Mindoro rice farm to 40% for a leaseholder on a



- 44 -
Palawan farm. The high index in Palawan would be due to the lower le:el of
yields expected at full development (para. 5.03). The average incremental
rent recovery index is 20%. While these indices show that there would be
scope for further cost recovery, even at full development more than half the
farmers in the project area would be below the absolute poverty level, which
in the Philippines is a reasonable approximate value of the critical con-
sumption level. Taking the present value of the incremental water charges,
project costs, and annual 0&2I costs, the cost recovery index is 16%. The
index is smaller than those in other Bank-assisted projects in the
Philippines. This is due to the fact that the proposed project consists
primarily of construction of new irrigation facilities, while previous
projects have had large components aimed at rehabilitation of existing
facilities.
6.13      To ensure sound O&M practices and an equitable contribution by
beneficiaries toward recoaery of project capital costs, the following assur-
ances have been obtained:
(a) the NIA would make annual budgetary provision to supply the
funds necessary for O&M of the project works;
(b) irrigation fees would be levied to provide NIA with sufficient
funds to ensure sound O&M practices and to contribute towards
recovery of as much as possible of the investment cost within
a reasonable period, taking into account farmers' incentives
and capacity to pay. A gradual increase in irrigation fees
over a period of five years from completion of construction to a
level equivalent to about 3.5 cavans of paddy per ha in the wet
season and 4.4 cavans in the dry season would meet the require-
ment;
(c) the NIA would take all necessary actions to ensure full and
prompt collection of the irrigation fees; and
(d) the Government and the Bank would consult annually on the adequacy
of water charges and the collection thereof.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The provision of improved water control and drainage under the pro-
posed project and better agricultural supporting services would increase
yields on about 37,800 ha which are currently under rainfed cultivation or
limited irrigation. Rice would be the principal crop grown throughout the
project area, and about 5,700 ha of land presently devoted to coconuts,
and rough grazing or brushland would be converted to paddy fields upon the
a-vailability of an assured water supply.  Approximately 11,600 farm familiep;
and 900 laa,lless laborers' families, a total of about 74,000 people, would
benefit directly from the proceeds of increased production and consequent
employment. The annual demand for farm labor would increase by about 3
million man-days, equivalent to some 12,500 full-time jobs. Access to markel:s
would be enhanced in the project area by the improved and denser network of
roads that would be built along the canals and drains.  In the Palawan sub-
project area the project would contribute to an intensification of the malaria
control program aimed at reducing the disease risk for a population of 12,000
people. The project's per hectare construction cost of US$2,185, excluding
costs due to expected price increases, is in line with the costs of previous
Bank-assisted irrigation projects. The project would meet the Government's
objectives of increased food production and more balanced regional distribti-
tion of development at a capital cost of about US$7,170 per benefited farm
family. The cost of the malaria component would amount to about US$200 per
family in the endemic area. At full agricultural development the project
would result in rice exports worth US$61 million per year at the forecast
world market prices for rice. The net foreign exchange earnings would be
US$50 million per year after deducting the incremental costs of imported
fertilizer, chemicals and fuel.
7.02      Distribution of Benefits.  Farmers within the three subproject are:as
would benefit from the project roughly in proportion to the area of land they
cultivate in a given year. However, smaller farmers would tend to receive a
larger share than would correspond to their farm sizes as a result of
increased employment opportunities generated by greater cropping intensities.
About 90% of the benefits to be derived from the project at full development
.jould accrue to the target group which consists of 98% of the farm families
or about 68,000 people. In the Palawan subproject area, where the skewness in
land distribution is more marked, about 20% of the benefits would go to 6% of
the farmn families falling outside the target group.  However, the incomes of
these families are only marginally above the absolute poverty level.
7.03      Foreign Exchange.  The unit of account is uncommitted foreign
exchange in the hands of the Government, expressed in terms of local currency.
All tradeable components are valued directly in foreign exchange and converted
to local currency at the official exchange rate and adjusted for local trans-
port and handling. Specific conversion factors for a number of broad cate-
gories of goods and services produced or consumed by the project have been
used to express all nontradeable inputs and outputs in terms of the common
unit of account (Annex 2, Table 14).



- 47 -
7.04      Benefits.  Expected future yields, cropping intensities, and produc-
tion with and without the project are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6
presents the farm-gate prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank's
commodity price forecasts for rice and chemical fertilizers. Gross returns,
production costs, net returns (without accounting for labor) and labor
requirements per ha are given in Annex 2. Figure 5.1 shows the proposed
cropping calendar. Table 7.1 summarizes the foregoing information and gives
the expected benefits in the project area at full agricultural development.
7.05      Farm Labor.  As a result of the project, the demand for labor would
increase from 3.6 million man-days without the project to 6.4 million man-days
with the project. Presently, there are an estimated 11,600 farm families and
900 landless families in the project area. The average family size is 6.0,
from which two full-time workers are available, giving a total labor supply of
24,900 workers. Assuming an annual growth in labor force of 3% in Mindoro
Oriental, 4% in Mindoro Occidental and 5% in Palawan where immigration is
expected to accelerate moderately due to the relative abundance of land and
the oil exploration activities going on in the island, (compared to a
historical growth in population of 3.35%, 5% and 4.78% in each of these
provinces respectively, due to migration, and 2.5% for the country as a whole)
the total labor supply at full development in 1990 would amount to 35,000
workers. Assuming 20 days of work per month, the total available monthly
labor supply would be 0.7 million man-days in 1990 (see Table 7.2). An
examination of the monthly demand for labor (Annex 2, Table 7) shows that the
peak demand occurs between September and March. While for some of these
months shortages could develop in Palawan, it is expected that extra labor
would be supplied by the other agricultural areas in the island, where crop-
ping intensities would be substantially lower. Due to heavy underemployment
in the agricultural sector the shadow wage rate for rural workers in the
Philippines has been estimated at 52% of the ongoing market wage of P 10/day
or P 5.2/day. In order to convert it into border prices, a consumption
conversion factor of 0.84 was applied rendering an economic cost of labor of
P 4.4/day which bears the same relation to the ongoing market wage as was
found in previous irrigation projects. The incremental labor cost due to
the project would be P 12.3 million.
7.06      Investment Costs.  The total economic capital cost in border prices
is US$71.8 million comprising US$43.9, for the Mindoro Oriental subproject,
US$10.6 for the Mindoro Occidental subproject and US$17.3 for the Palawan
subproject. The annual O&M costs are on average US$40/ha for the project
areas. These capital cost figures include allowances for physical contingen-
cies, as well as US$400,000 for the malaria component in Palawan but exclude
price contingencies.
7.07      Development Period.  If work proceeds according to the implementa-
tion schedule, all the systems in the project would be completed in time for
the second crop in 1986. On some of the systems, especially the smaller ones,
benefits would be realized earlier, but for the purposes of the economic
analysis, it is assumed that benefits from the irrigation systems would begin
in the sixth year and continue increasing until the projected maximum is
achieved in 1990.



- 48 -
7.08      Economic Rate of Return.  On the basis of the foregoing
assumptions and discounting the costs and benefits over a 40-year period,
the economic rate of return of the project is 18% (Table 7.3). Rates of
return for the subprojects are 17% for Mindoro Oriental, 20% for Mindoro
Occidental, and 19% for Palawan. At a discount rate of 10%, the estimated
opportunity cost of capital in the Philippines, the economic net present
value of the project in 1980 is US$58 million.
7.09      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analysis was used to determine
which variables would be most crucial to the success of the project. In
carrying out the sensitivity analysis, two measures were developed for each
variable tested - the crossover value and the elasticity. The crossover value
is the value of the variable tested for which NPV discounted at 10% is zero,
and is a measure of how far the variable can differ from its most likely value
before the project becomes economically unacceptable. The crossover value may
also be interpreted as the value of the variable tested, beyond which the
economic rate of return would be below 10%. The elasticity is defined as the
percentage change in NPV discounted at 10% with respect to a 1% change in the
variable tested. It is a measure of the rate of change of NPV change for any
change of variable, at the most likely value of that variable./I
7.10      The numerical results are presented in Table 7.4, which shows that
the success of the project is mildly sensitive to low cropping intensities,
and to shortfalls in yield. The project is also sensitive to future world
market prices, which are beyond the control of the project. The probability
of these critical variations is discussed below:
(a) Yields. The crossover values of yields are about 25% below the
expected project yields at full development. The probability of
future yields falling below the crossover yields is low since many
farmers are already achieving the projected yield levels in neigh-
boring areas with reliable water supply. Also, the incidence of
typhoon damage is low in the area, a factor that depresses average
yields in other regions of the Philippines.
(b) Prices. The crossover value lies around 36% below the projected
level. This should give enough margin, especially if one considers
that the Philippines should be able to improve its export quality by
1990.
(c) Construction Costs. A cost overrun of almost 100% in real terms
is unlikely considering the simple nature of the works and NIA's
long experience with similar projects.
/I The elasticity generally changes for movements along the NPV-variable
curve.



- 49 -
(d) Economic Wage Rate. The economic rate of return is insensitive to
this variable since economic wages would practically have to
increase by almost seven times in order to make the project
uneconomic.
(e)  Cropping Intensity.  It is highly unlikely that this variable
would drop to 116% considering that present intensities without
irrigation in the project's existing rice areas are practically
reaching this intensity.
7.11      Risks.  No major problems of implementation are anticipated since
this would be the twelfth Bank-assisted irrigation project in the
Philippines and the NIA has developed considerable experience over the
period of association. However, a six-year implementation period has been
adopted to allow for the geographic dispersion of the project over three
provinces.

8.  AGREEMEN?S REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01       During negotiations agreement with the Goverrnjient was reached on
the following principal points:
(a)  NIA would prepare terms of reference aoid an outline of the O&M study
to be financed under the project and ifter revi..w by the Bank would
carry out the study with the issistance of consultants (para.3.25);
(b)  NIA and IHOi would enter an agreement acceptable to the Bank by
December 31, 1980, for the implementation of the malaria control
component of the project (para. 3.28); and
(c)  NIA would ensure that the aggregate amount of zivil workrs done by
force account would not exceed 40'% of .ne total cost of civil
works excluding those subject to ICB (para. 3.33).
8.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$71.0 million for - period of 21) years including 5 years

MEDIUM-SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
Accounting Procedures for Force Account Work and Minor Contracts
1.        Force account work for the proposed project would include
construction of drains, gravel surfacing of service roads along laterals,
on-farm development and construction of minor O&M buildings. In the past,
NIA has experienced considerable difficulty in attracting bids for drains as
the scope of such works is limited and the contractors in the Philippines do
not have proper equipment for drainage excavation. NIA also failed to
implement by contract works of such a scattered nature as minor structures
and surfacing of roads along laterals. On-farm development has the added
difficulty of execution on short notice to avoid the growing season and bad
weather. The estimated cost of force account works, including price
contingencies, would be about US$27.0 million. Allowing US$5.0 million to
finish incompleted contract works by force account would bring the total
amount to US$32 million. This would include US$7.0 million for procurement
of the force account equipment (by contract), US$5.0 million for procurement
of such construction materials as cement and reinforcements etc., (by
contract) and US$20.0 million for such expenditures as costs of labor, fuel,
lubrication and miscellaneous materials. Reimbursement for expenditures
from the US$20 million would be based on the statements of expenditure
procedure. The same procedure would be used for minor civil works contracts
(less than P 1 million, or US$140,000).
2.        Although NIA maintains accounts and keeps reliable records on the
status of force account works, it is simpler for the supervision missions to
verify the completed works then to scrutinize the details of accounts and
expenditures. Therefore it is proposed that the disbursement would be based
on a percentage of the product of quantities of the following major items of
work and agreed unit rates. Documentation to support disbursements would
identify the location of the completed works. The unit rates would be based
on the analysis for each item to be submitted by NIA with supporting
documents for Bank review before December 31, 1980. The detailed accounts
maintained by NIA would permit periodic revision of the unit rates as
necessary, on the basis of verification of actual expenditures. For minor
contracts subject to the statement of expenditures procedure, NIA would
retain copies of contracts, progress reports or invoices and evidence of
payments made to contractors for periodic review by Bank staff.

3.        NIA receives yearly budget allocations from the Government for each
project. The project office prepares a detailed work plan and assigns job
codes. Separate job codes are assigned for contract and force account works.
Detailed cost estimates are prepared for each job by the field offices with
headings for equipment use and time, major materials (centrally procured),
miscellaneous materials (locally procured), direct labor, fuel and lubricants
and engineering supervision. These cost estimates are subject to the review
of an auditor for the Commission on Audits (COA) attached to each Project

Office. The expenditure is incurred and monthly accounts are submitted by
each field office to the Project Office. All payment vouchers and monthly
accounts are reviewed by the Auditor. The accounting section of the Project
Office verifies expenditures for each job code against the estimated cost
and submits to the Central Office a summary of expenditure with copies of
payment vouchers. NIA's central office prepares the withdrawal application
using the monthly summary for each project.
