IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
LIVESTOCK SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Credit 1725 GUI)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Livestock Sector
Rehabilitation Project (LSRP) for which IDA Credit 1725-GUI in the amount of SDR 8.5 million
(US$9.8 million equivalent) was approved on July 8, 1986 and made effective on July 7, 1987.
The original closing date of December 31, 1992 was extended three times to
December 31, 1995. The Credit was fully disbursed and the final disbursement took place on
May 22, 1996.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. P. Bono (Consultant) with the support of Mr. Noel
Chabeuf, Task Manager, and reviewed by Messrs. Jean Paul Chausse, Technical Manager, Africa
Region Agricultural Group 11 and Cornelis de Haan, Livestock Advisor, Agriculture and Forestry
Systems Division, Agriculture and Natural Resources Department. The ICR is based on material
in the project files and the findings of the Bank's final supervision/completion mission to
Guinea. The Borrower's representatives, particularly the Director and staff of the National
Livestock Directorate, worked very closely with the mission providing information and views
that are reflected in the mission's Aide Memoire in Appendix A. The Borrower contributed to
the ICR by providing its own evaluation of the Project's execution, which is included in
Appendix B.
The ICR was sent to the project's co-financiers for comments, but none were
received.

Introduction
1.           The Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (LSRP) was prepared at the request
of the new Government that took office in Guinea in 1984. The lessons learned from the
cancellation of the Livestock Development Project (Credit 1063 GUI, approved in September
1980 and canceled three years later) were incorporated in the LSRP. IDA's involvement in the
LSRP was seen as essential in helping the Government implement its new economic strategy and
contributing to growth in an economy undergoing restructuring. The Government's new policy
direction and changes were in line with IDA's recommendations as elaborated in the Agricultural
Sector Review.I Poor animal health is the main constraint to livestock productivity and growth
on which about 160,000 families or 30% of Guinea's rural population depend. Under the
previous Government, the livestock sector suffered discrimination and harassment; 10% of the
herd had to be sold at a fixed, below market, price through the State Cattle Marketing Agency,
ENCOBE. Many herders emigrated and others hid their animals in forests to avoid taxation and
forced sale to ENCOBE.
Project Objectives
2.           The major objectives of the LSRP were to increase the productivity of cattle
herds and improve the living standards of cattle-herding families. Three basic components were
included in the project:
Report No. GUI-4627, 1984.



- iii -
(a)   support for the privatization of the livestock service through the establishment of
herders' associations; creation of the Veterinary Input Supply Center (CAVET;
Centrale d'Approvisionnement Veterinaire) for the production, purchase, and
distribution and sale of livestock inputs; and the provision of a pilot credit
component to establish private veterinarians, animal production farms, herders'
associations, and a system for the distribution of livestock inputs;
(b)   strengthening of a reduced public National Livestock Directorate (DNE) by
constructing or renovating the central livestock department and network of 33
field offices, laboratories, training centers, and purchasing of vehicles; and
(c)    provision of technical assistance (TA) and training.
3.    ~      Total project costs were estimated at US$22.2 million; cofinancing was provided
by the Banque Arabe pour le Developpement Economique en Afrique (BADEA) for US$4.5
million, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE, now Caisse Francaise de
Developpement) for US$3.8 million, and Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for US$1.4
million.
4.           The objectives were pragmatic, clear, and well-adapted to the prevailing
conditions in the country, i.e., ineffective Government services, poor operational budgets, and
inadequate infrastructure. Herders were not organized and were basically distrustful of the
Government since they had been continuously harassed by the previous regime. Inputs were
generally scarce and of poor quality. Before the LSRP was started, the cattle marketing
monopoly of ENCOBE was abolished and prices were liberalized. During implementation of the
LSRP, staff of DNE was reduced by two-thirds to 600 and a relevant training program was
carried out at all levels. The LSRP was demanding for the implementation agency, although it
was not overly complex since the different components were interrelated. The only risks that
might have affected the project's success were resistance to implementation of the DNE staff-
reduction program and herders willingness to participate in the LSRP. Neither of these risks
proved to be a serious threat as project management was able to cope with them successfully.
DNE was the implementing agency.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.           The most important achievement was the creation of 240 herders' associations
and the training of more than 1,000 veterinary auxiliaries, the majority whom belong to herders'
families. The construction program at DNE, as well as the purchase of vehicles and an intensive
staff training program, contributed to building an efficient team both at headquarters and in the
field. Efforts were made to privatize the veterinary profession and establish the parastatal
CAVET and an Atelier for Mineral Licks (APILEC; Atelier de Piere A Lecher). However, these
institutional-building components did not achieve their objectives and the institutions are soon to
be privatized. An important achievement was the restoration of trust between the herder
community and the Government. This trust was instrumental in the return of a large number of
herders who had fled the country during the tenure of the previous regime. More than 600,000
head of cattle are estimated to have returned to Guinea as a result of the new Government's
liberalization policy.



- iv-
6.           The project was positively affected by the Government's steady commitment to
its objectives and the exemplary relationship maintained between the Borrower and co-
financiers. Joint supervision missions were systematically carried out and the LSRP evolved
into a national sectoral "umbrella" program with the participation of a number of donors and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
7.           The project, however, suffered some serious setbacks because of delays in the
provision of counterpart funds. At one stage, this problem posed serious consequences for the
vaccination program. Other obstacles to implementation included bureaucratic procedures and
the excessive time required for approval of essential legislation. Implementation delays were
also caused by setbacks in the construction program. The closing date had to be extended three
times to accommodate an expanded program for the organization of herders' associations.
8.           The in-depth dialogue between the Bank and the Government before project
preparation, which led to the identification of key problems, such as cattle marketing and DNE's
excessive bureaucracy, was particularly useful in paving the way toward smooth implementation.
Two Project Preparation Facility (PPF) allocations helped in designing buildings and purchasing
vaccines as part of start-up activities, and in carrying out the selection of DNE staff. Bank
performance at appraisal, considering the serious problems it had to face, was satisfactory. The
financial package was appropriate and the amount adequate. The credit component suffered
from the beginning due to the lack of a credible institution to carry out this component. The
Project's initial disbursement period was also unrealistically short.
9.           The Government in general and the Ministry of Agriculture in particular
followed the recommendations made of the supervision missions. However, DNE was powerless
to change some of the procedures that affected disbursements, such as the availability of
counterpart funds. It had also, at one stage, problems with the timely delivery of some audits.
The implementing agency complied with the major Credit covenants. It made good use of
technical assistance and applied most of the studies' recommendations.
10.          Overall, the LSRP was successful in achieving its objectives. The outcome is
likely to be sustainable because of Government's commitment to the Project's objectives, and
because the basis for financial autonomy is being established with herders paying partially or
fully for cattle vaccinations and other services. Cattle drenching is now fully paid for by their
owners. The herders' associations are well on the way to becoming financially autonomous.
11.          Actual project costs were US$24.6 million, as against US$22.2 million
estimated. The difference can be explained by higher than estimated operating costs, training
and equipment purchases. Actual project financing by IDA was US$11.45 million (US$1.65
million more than estimated, primarily because of the depreciation of the US$); CCCE US$3.8
million (same as estimated); BADEA US$4.75 million (US$0.25 million more than estimated);
FAC US$1.3 million (US$0.1 million less than estimated); and Government US$3.3 million
(US$0.7 million more than estimated).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
12.          Project outcome was satisfactory; its physical, institutional, and economic
objectives were achieved despite the difficulties encountered at the beginning.  The
macroeconomic changes introduced by the new regime were instrumental in opening up a



v -
dialogue between the herders and DNE.  The training program  helped promote a better
understanding of the problems affecting the livestock sector and gave a certain measure of
independence to carry some of the animal health program, such as vaccinations, drenching, and
animal disease prevention. Technical assistance was an essential element in the success of the
LSRP; the transfer of experience from the Central African Republic (CAR) in organizing the
herders' associations is a good example.
13.           Future project operations will concentrate on completing divestment of
commercially viable productive activities and services from the Government to herders
associations and private veterinarians and on developing other professional organizations of
herders, butchers, poultry and pig producers, and livestock traders and constructing small
abattoirs and village cattle and poultry markets. Finally, DNE's normative functions will be
strengthened by designing sectoral policies, epidemiological surveillance, data collection, and
analysis.
14.           The most important lessons leamed from the LSRP are the following: (a) an
appropriate macroeconomic framework is essential to achieving success; (b) sound project
identification and preparation are helpful in recognizing the major difficulties likely to be
encountered during implementation; (c) the frequency and regularity of supervision missions and
their composition, as in the LSRP, of technical specialists and representatives of Co-financiers
contributed significantly to successful project implementation; (d) a full and frank dialogue
between the Bank and the Government, particularly in respect of DNE, was constructive and
helped to obtain successful project outcomes; (e) training can play a key role in upgrading skills,
as it did in this case for both the DNE and herders; (f) the mid-term review can be very helpful in
making midcourse changes during implementation, as it did in the LSRP to reorient some project
components, particularly those related to the herders' associations and the emphasis on animal
husbandry and nutrition; the successful turnaround of relations between the herders and livestock
services is a major accomplishment of the LSRP and also a major factor in the likely
sustainability of the Project's achievements; and (g) the problem that will require particular
attention in the future is the timely availability of counterpart funding; without a proper solution
to this bottleneck, successful project implementation will be difficult.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
LIVESTOCK SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1725-GUI)
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.           Introduction
1.           The Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (LSRP) was prepared at the request of the
new Government that took office in Guinea in 1984. The lessons learned from the cancellation of the
Livestock Development Project (Credit 1063 GUI, approved in September 1980 and canceled three years
later) were incorporated in the LSRP. The involvement of the International Development Association
(IDA) in this project was seen as essential in helping the Government implement its new economic
strategy and contributing to growth in an economy undergoing restructuring. The Government's new
policy direction and changes were in line with IDA's recommendations as elaborated in the Agricultural
Sector Review.  Poor animal health was the main constraint to livestock productivity and growth on
which about 160,000 families or 30 percent of Guinea's rural population depended. Under the previous
Government, the livestock sector suffered discrimination and harassment; 10 percent of the herd had to
be sold at a fixed, below market price through the State Cattle Marketing Agency (ENCOBE). Many
herders emigrated to neighboring countries, while others hid their animals in forests to avoid taxation
and forced sale.
B.           Project Objectives
2.           The major objectives of the LSRP were to increase the productivity of cattle herds and
improve the living standards of cattle-herding families. Greater productivity of cattle herds was to be
achieved through simple measures such as vaccinations against common cattle diseases, provision of
medicines and mineral licks, and upgrading of livestock husbandry and veterinary support services. The
project was to help create an environment conducive to the privatization of livestock services and
provision of inputs.
3.           The project included three basic components:
(a)    Support for the privatization of livestock service through the establishment of 45
herders' associations to enable them to employ their own agents for simple animal health
treatments and sale of livestock inputs. On average, each association would include
2   Report No. GUI-4627, 1984.



2
about 700 herders, owning about 7,000 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats; and support
was to be provided to them for an initial supply of livestock inputs and through the
creation of the a Veterinary Input Supply Center (CAVET; Centrale
d'Approvisionnement Veterinaire), at Conakry, for the production, purchase,
distribution, and sale of livestock inputs. Since private sector interest in marketing
livestock inputs was limited at the start of the LSRP, the Government was mainly
responsible for the operations of CAVET, but it was expected that the herders'
associations especially would begin to participate as soon as CAVET became an
attractive operation. A small pilot credit component was included for the establishment
of private veterinarians, animal production farms, herders' associations, and distribution
of livestock inputs;
(b)    Strengthening of a reduced public livestock service by renovating and constructing
facilities at the central National Livestock Directorate (DNE; Direction Nationale de
l'Elevage), including a diagnostic laboratory, 22 Prefectoral Livestock Services (SPEs;
Service Prefectoral de I'Elevage) field offices and training centers, and provision of
equipment, vehicles, and basic materials to DNE, SPEs, and 320 Livestock Posts (PE;
Poste d'Elevage) for the annual national vaccination campaigns against common cattle
diseases; and
(c)    Technical assistance (TA), which included 19 staff years of internationally recruited
resident specialists and about 39 months of short-term consultants to assist in project
implementation, carry out studies, and prepare a possible follow-up project. The training
sub-component included the establishment of a training center in Labe with a capacity
for 40 trainees to attend refresher courses and to provide training for about 240 staff and
livestock agents appointed by the herder's associations.  Fellowships for external
training was to be provided for high-level staff of the National Directorate of Livestock
(DNE).
The most important components were the upgrading of livestock services (US$4.5 million), technical
assistance (US$4.0 million), livestock inputs (US$2.4 million), and training (US$2.3 million). Total
project costs were estimated at US$22.2 million; cofinancing was provided by the Banque Arabe pour le
Developpement Economique en Afrique (BADEA) for US$4.5 million, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE, now Caisse Fran,aise de Developpement) for US$3.8 million, and Fonds d'Aide et
de Cooperation (FAC) for US$1.4 million; the Government for US$2.6 million; and the beneficiaries for
US$100,000.
4.            Although one of Government's objectives was to increase the availability of animal
products, principally meat and milk for the urban population, other important goals were to improve the
monetary income of herders by increasing the offtake rate and to protect the national herd against major
animal diseases. An earlier project with the same objectives (Livestock Development Project, Credit
1063-GUI, for SDR 13.3 million), effective in July 1981, encountered major counterpart financing and
implementation problems from the beginning. Perhaps the most serious problem that affected the
viability of the previous project was the marketing system that required herders to sell 10 percent of their
animals at a very low official price. This, together with the vaccination tax, discouraged herders from
participating in the project, and the IDA credit was canceled in 1983. Very little was achieved and the



3
principal disbursement was for TA However, after the change in Government in 1984, ENCOBE was
dissolved and IDA was requested to consider a new project with the same objectives as the earlier one,
but in a better economic environment. The new project was appraised in June 1986 and became effective
in July 1987.
5.            Project objectives were pragmatic, clear, realistic, and well-suited to tackling ineffective
government services because of poor personnel management, very limited operational budget,
inadequate infrastructure and derelict equipment and vehicles. Herders were not organized and worse,
many of them had abandoned the country because of the repressive environment, poor cattle prices,
arbitrary marketing systems, and constant harassment through excessive taxes. The veterinary profession
was generally poorly trained and its services, provided through the Government, were generally of low
quality. Inputs were scarce and their supply unreliable.
6.           In a situation in which the majority of Government services were overstaffed, plagued
with bureaucracy, and deprived of any effective operational means, the project initially placed heavy
demands on DNE as implementing agency. Although the project included several subcomponents, its
design was not overly complex, as all of them were interrelated. The risks mentioned in the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) that might have affected the project were the implementation of the staff
rationalization program and the willingness of livestock owners to participate in the LSRP. Neither
became an issue during project implementation. The issue of timely counterpart funding was not
considered a risk factor.
C.           Achievement of Objectives
7.           The strengthening of a reduced public livestock service was substantially achieved
through a cornprehensive training program implemented both nationally and overseas, a building
program for headquarters and field offices, the purchase of vehicles, and establishment of a training
center at Labe. DNE management and administration were effectively supported with the continuous
presence of high-quality technical advisers and the establishment of a monitoring unit. As a condition of
Credit effectiveness and in line with the country's new macroeconomics policies, DNE staff was reduced
by two-thirds, after a rigorous and transparent test program. This resulted in the dismissal of 1,200
unqualified people. Another condition of effectiveness was the dissolution of ENCOBE, which resulted
in the instant liberalization of livestock marketing.
8.           The sectoral objectives were obtained first through the successful creation of some 240
herders' associations that are increasingly involved in the design and implementation of livestock
development activities at both the regional and local levels. The original concept in the SAR was that of
45 herders' association with 500 members each; this concept was reconsidered during the mid-term
review, when the concept of a family or kinship-size association was adopted instead. This led to the
establishment of some 240 herder groups with a total membership of 7,000 herders. The creation of
CAVET opened a national market for veterinary pharmaceuticals. Although it was instrumental in
supporting the initial development of a private veterinary profession, CAVET failed to keep up with the
growing demand for veterinary products and in the end became a bottleneck instead. Furthermore, the
Atelier for Mineral Licks (APILEC, Atelier de piere a lecher), which was designed to address recognized
needs for livestock mineral supplements and which had received steady support from donors, appears to
have outlived its usefulness. APILEC was technically justified as a tool to combat mineral deficiencies

and improve livestock productivity, but it failed to achieve commercial viability because of its inability
to respond to consumer purchasing patterns.
9.           Institutional development was one of the most difficult components to implement, but it
was achieved substantially by reducing DNE staff numbers, augmenting DNE's infrastructure and
logistics, and improving standards for professionals and field agents, mainly through training. The
establishment of the herders' associations was a major achievement, and they are functioning
satisfactorily despite initial difficulties. The absence of an enabling regulatory framework and a
financial support system delayed the establishment of private veterinarians. Institutional problems
manifested themselves in the operations of the Banque pour le Commerce et 1' Industrie de la Guin6e
(Commercial and Industrial Bank of Guinea), the on-lending agency. Implementation of the credit
component became possible only after a suitable financial operator was identified and appropriate
procedures agreed upon.
10.          The physical components, including the construction and rehabilitation of the DNE and
field offices, suffered delays mainly because of difficulties by the Government in meeting BADEA's (the
major financier of the building component) loan disbursement conditions. This led to some cost
escalation and scaling back of the construction program. Construction of the Labe training center and
rehabilitation of the Kindia vaccine laboratory were also delayed somewhat. But, overall the building
program was carried out satisfactorily. Vehicles were purchased on time, and repair and maintenance
problems were resolved despite some initial difficulties.
11.          Improvement in the country's general sociopolitical conditions produced:
(a)    the return of a large number of herders who had earlier fled the country;
(b)    liberalization of cattle marketing; and
(c)    restoration of trust between herders and the Government, yielding more reliable
livestock data.
All these factors contributed to higher recorded livestock figures: 2,177,325 head of
cattle recorded in the December 1995 official census, versus 1,100,000 officially recorded at project
appraisal in 1985. It is estimated that repatriation and the end of under-reporting that had been caused by
fiscal and political pressures accounted for about 500,000 to 600,000 of the increase in the number of
cattle head, while the rest is attributable to herd growth, averaging 2.5 % annually over eight years, in
response to improved animal health and technical support. An economic rate of return (ERR) of 18%,
compared with 16% estimated at appraisal, was computed on the basis of preliminary census data.
D.            Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors Subject to Government Control
12.          Implementation was positively affected by Government's commitment to achieving the
project's objectives as seen in its adherence to sound socio-economic policies and the exemplary
cooperation between the Borrower and Co-financiers, as well as among the latter. This was reflected in
the systematic implementation of joint supervision missions throughout project implementation.
Another result of this close cooperation was the gradual evolution of the LSRP into a national sectoral



5
"umbrella" program  under which all bilateral and multilateral projects were accommodated and
coordinated.
13.          On the other hand, the project suffered, especially during 1989-92, because of the
increasingly acute shortage and late release of counterpart funds, even though the financial commitments
made by Government at appraisal were eventually exceeded. The delays in financing led to increased
construction costs for the building and remodeling of DNE headquarters, laboratories, training center,
and field offices and implementation delays of about two years.
14.          Difficulties in communications between BADEA and the Government also delayed the
construction and rehabilitation program. Bureaucratic procedures slowed implementation, especially the
cumbersome procurement and lengthy custom clearance processes that often took almost ten months.
15.          Performance of DNE, the implementing agency, was satisfactory. DNE's two directors
over the implementation period were technically competent and fully committed. The administrative and
finance directors, however, were less well-suited to their positions and had to be replaced several times.
Until the appointment of the current manager three years ago, heavy reliance was placed on TA, which
was both timely and of good quality. Nevertheless, the LSRP closing date had to be extended by three
years, largely because of delays in implementing the decisions made at the mid-term review and the shift
to a greater focus on creating the herders' associations. The studies envisaged at appraisal were carried
out as planned and the results were of substantive value
E.           Project Sustainability
16.          The LSRP is likely to be sustainable because: (a) the Government is committed to the
Project's objectives, which were mostly achieved and produced a financially and technically viable
operation;  the streamlined and strengthened livestock services have gradually evolved into an
"umbrella" program, establishing a level of control and coordination at the national level of all livestock
operations, whether financed bilaterally or multilaterally; (b) the social impact of the project is
significant in having created the herders' associations that have demonstrated their capability to organize
national events (the Boke cattle fair) and significantly contributed to the financing of their development;
(c) cattle owners are now paying all or part of the animal vaccination costs and are paying fully for the
treatment of calves; the coverage attained by the project is expected to expand in the near future, even
though Government's timely delivery of its financial contribution remains erratic; and (d) project
sustainability will be strengthened with the implementation of a follow-on operation approved by IDA in
April 1996, the National Agricultural Services Project (Cr.2839-GUI).
F.           Bank Performance
17.          Bank performance was satisfactory during project identification, preparation, and
appraisal because staff evaluated realistically Government's commitment, weakness of the implementing
agency, and the need to completely overhaul the DNE. The Project's design, although complex, was
sound and consistent with the need to have an integrated sectoral approach with different but closely
interrelated components that had to be implemented simultaneously. Project risks were recognized early
and did not pose serious problems during implementation. The financial package was appropriate and
adequate. Experience gained with the previous IDA-supported livestock project (Credit 1065-GUI)



6
helped to produce a sound project and the fruitful dialogue that the Bank and the Government maintained
over the period of one year was useful in exploring key issues such as the liberalization of cattle
marketing, reduction of DNE staff, and privatization of some services. A Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) financing for US$ 350,000 paid for architectural services for the design of buildings, a base line
survey of the livestock sector, the cost of vehicles for a vaccination campaign, and a study of financial
procedures and control. Another PPF financed the tests and personnel selection at DNE, as well as a cost
analysis study for inputs and services. Project preparation was financed from funds for the previous
project and was carried out by a consulting firm with the participation of local staff and assistance from
the Bank. Livestock sector problems were clearly defined together with a possible development strategy.
All the major aspects, technical, financial, economic, and institutional were well covered, with the
exception of the social aspects, which were not given very high priority, and the environmental ones,
which were practically ignored. Bank assistance in the pre-appraisal totaled 48 staff weeks with the
participation of livestock specialists, financial analysts, economists, and others.  Appraisal was
completed within 37 staff weeks.
18.          In general, the performance of Co-financiers was also satisfactory, although delays were
experienced in meeting BADEA's conditions of effectiveness because of tardy answers from BADEA's
Khartoum head offices, which resulted in an increase in the cost of building headquarters facilities.
Cofinancing for some operational expenses was provided by the CCCE/CFD to keep operations on track
when counterpart funds were late in being released.
19.          The LSRP required a considerable amount of supervision, which was satisfactorily
conducted. An average of two to three missions a year, totaling 136 staff weeks, was required and
generally included two or three people, predominantly technicians (livestock specialists and
agronomists) who dealt efficiently with complex financial, institutional, and legal issues, and spent
about 10-12 days in the field per mission The cofinancing agencies, mainly CFD and FAC, participated
systematically in the supervision missions. When certain problems became acute, such as those caused
by the periodic delays in provision of counterpart funds, quick interventions by the Bank and other Co-
financiers, particularly the European Union, averted the crises.  The quality of supervision was
satisfactory, although it suffered from a lack of staff continuity. Only in the last three years has
supervision been carried out by the same team.
G.            Borrower Performance
20.           The design of the LSRP reflected Government priorities and strategies to rehabilitate a
sector that had been seriously undermined by the previous regime. During implementation, although the
Ministry of Agriculture in general, and the DNE in particular, supported the project objectives and
followed very closely the suggestions of the joint Bank/Co-financiers supervision missions, the official
bureaucracy and the extremely complex administrative procedures caused some of the serious
implementation delays. For example, they were responsible for jeopardizing vaccination campaigns and
putting at risk serious efforts made in earlier years to control Rinderpest and Contagious Bovine
Pleuropneumonia (CBPP). The credit component suffered because a credible institutional solution was
not found despite vigorous efforts made by DNE, the Bank, and Co-financiers.
21.           The institutional and the physical objectives were the most important targets met during
project implementation, and were closely followed by the social ones. The implementing agency, with



7
few exceptions, complied with the major Credit covenants, particularly those relating to institutional
changes and effective management and staffing. Project implementation progress was adequately
reported. Government, in general, followed the advice of the Bank and Co-financiers particularly in
critical areas, such as finance, administration, and procurement. DNE was almost powerless in resolving
the counterpart funding problem and required strong support from the Bank and the Co-financiers. It had
difficulties in ensuring the timely delivery of audits, and these were often qualified. It made a good use
of the TA and, in most cases, it implemented the results or findings of the studies financed under the
LSRP.
H.    Assessment of Outcome
22.          The project achieved all of its major objectives, in spite of its complex design and the
problems that originated outside DNE. DNE did not have any experience in managing projects such as
the LSRP, and had to find its way in a sector, the participants of which were distrustful of Government
intervention.  Although herders were prepared to adopt the simple practices of vaccination and
drenching, it took major effort in terms of logistics and persuasion to consolidate the technical messages.
The establishment of the herders' associations had mixed results at the beginning. Following the mid-
term review and the establishment of the linkage with the Central African Republic (CAR) National
Livestock Project, which was noteworthy for its achievements in this field, LSRP objectives were
reassessed and a new approach was adopted that produced successful results. Delays were experienced
in implementation because of: (a) the socio-political situation at the beginning of implementation and
the complete change in vision and culture that the project implied; b) delays in the availability of
counterpart funds during the second half of the implementation, which in turn resulted in delays in
funding operational expenses out of the IDA Credit; and (c) bureaucratic hurdles, partly inherited from
the previous regime, partly resulting from a high turnover of senior staff, particularly at the Ministry of
Finance and Planning, involved in processing financial documents.
23.          The privatization of veterinary services became successful in 1996, when the enabling
legislation (Code de l'Elevage) was enacted, allowing private veterinarians to establish themselves
independently and to participate in the vaccination campaigns under the "mandat sanitaire."
24.          Although no environmental impact assessment was made at the time of appraisal, the
survey carried out for the appraisal of the National Agricultural Services Project, clearly indicates the
positive impact of livestock development on the environment.
25.          Poverty alleviation was not included explicitly among the original project objectives. It
was, however, achieved through implementation of the village small ruminants and poultry vaccination
components, which benefited the poorest among the rural population.
26.          Actual project costs were US$24.6 million, as against US$22.2 million estimated. The
difference can be explained by higher than estimated operating costs, training and equipment purchases.
Actual project financing by IDA was US$11.45 million (US$1.65 million more than estimated, primarily
because of the depreciation of the US$); CCCE US$3.8 million (same as estimated); BADEA US$4.75
million (US$0.25 million more than estimated); FAC US$1.3 million (US$0.1 million less than
estimated); and Government US$3.3 million (US$0.7 million more than estimated).

27.           The minimum requirement for a satisfactory project is a net present value that is positive
when flows are discounted at 10% for a major portion of the investment. Yearly operating costs were not
available. The mission adopted the operating-cost time series used at appraisal, converted into constant
values, using the 1987 inflator (1.305). Production of meat was estimated by the increase in the off-take
rate from 10.4% in year nine (1994) to 11.5% in year twenty (2005) Milk production was estimated
following the same criteria ( see Tables 9A and 9B in Part II, Statistical Annexes).
28.           A farm gate price of US$ 0.80 per kilogram (kg) cattle liveweight and US$ 0.40 per liter
of milk, based on current data, was used in the economic analysis. In calculating LSRP's ERR, only the
direct quantifiable benefits, i.e., meat and milk production, were taken into account. Based on the above
assumptions, the ERR was estimated at 18% (see Tables 9A and 9B in Part II, Statistical Annexes.).
1.            Future Operation
29.           A future operation would be based on the following premises:
(a)    Complete Government divestment of commercial productive activities through their
transfer to herders' associations and private veterinarians, particularly with respect to the
privatization of CAVET and APILEC and contractual arrangements with private
veterinarians for their participation in vaccination campaigns, through the "mandat
sanitaire."
(b)    Develop professional organizations for butchers, livestock traders, and poultry and pig
producers, for example, as well as provide support to their organizations through
planning and construction of infrastructure, such as small slaughterhouses and stock
marketing.
(c)    Further strengthen DNE in its public service functions-- design and supervision of sector
policies -- through data collection, processing, and analysis, particularly in the field of
epidemiology and diagnosis, as well as gathering socioeconomic information; and
improve DNE's ability to support professional organizations by increasing its TA and
training resources and capacity.
J.            Key Lessons Learned
30.           The most important lessons learned from the LSRP are the following: (a) an appropriate
macroeconomics framework is essential to achieving success; (b) sound project identification and
preparation are helpful in recognizing the major difficulties likely to be encountered during
implementation; (c) the frequency and regularity of supervision missions and their composition, as in the
LSRP, of technical specialists and representatives of Co-financiers contributed significantly to successful
project implementation; (d) a full and frank dialogue between the Bank and the Government, particularly
in respect of DNE, was constructive and helped to obtain successful project outcomes; (e) training can
play a key role in upgrading skills, as it did in this case for both the DNE and herders; (f) the mid-term
review can be very helpful in making midcourse changes during implementation, as it did in the LSRP to
reorient some project components, particularly those related to the herders' associations and the
emphasis on animal husbandry and nutrition; during the latter half of project implementation, contacts



9
between Guinean herders and organized herders in other countries, such as the CAR, were instrumental
in promoting the development of herders associations; and (g) the problem that will require particular
attention in the future is the timely availability of counterpart funding; without a proper solution to this
bottleneck, the success of any project in Guinea will remain in doubt, an important lesson learned from
the LSRP.
31.            An overoptimistic approach regarding the institutional capacity of the Government,
particularly its ability to provide counterpart funds, was at the origin of several crisis that endangered the
project's achievements.  The estimated disbursement period did not coincide with the country's
disbursement profile and resulted in the need for three successive annual extensions. A more realistic,
longer disbursement period should have been adopted or the project should have been simplified.

Economic Analysis
Capital Costs used in the Economic Analysis are current US$ disbursed by financiers by year converted
into 1995 constant US$ using the USA Consumer Price Index; see table 9A. Replacement and



20
maintenance costs from year 10 onwards have been assumed to represent 5% of the total amount
disbursed from year I to 9.
Livestock Inputs capital costs from year I to 9 are included in the capital costs. Livestock inputs running
costs from year 10 onwards have been assumed to be those estimated at appraisal but adjusted to current
values using the 1987/88 inflator (1.305).
Yearly actual operating costs were not available; the mission used the operating costs time series used at
appraisal but converted into constant values by using the 1987/88 inflator (1.305).
Physical production of meat has been estimated by an increase in the off-take rate from 10.4 at year one
to 11.5 at year twenty. Incremental milk production has been estimated following the same criteria (see
table 9B).
Prices
A farmgate price of US$0.8 per kilogram of liveweight has been used in the economic analysis.
Milk price used in the analysis is US$ 0.4/liter.
In calculating the Project's economic rate of return, only the directly quantifiable benefits, i.e. meat and
milk production of cattle herd, were taken into account.
Based on the above assumptions the ERR was estimated at 18%. Net Present Value was estimated at
10,360.7,at 12% Opportunity Cost of Capital.
Sensitivity Analysis
The effect on the Project's economic rate of return under various sensitivity tests is as follows:
Costs                    Benefits                   ERR %
Plus 10%                 Unchanged                   15
Plus 20%                 Unchanged                    13
Less 10%                 Unchanged                    21
Unchanged                Plus 10%                    21

Mamoudou Diallo, Directeur National et le Docteur Seny Mane, Directeur Adjoint, ainsi que, A partir du
13 Novembre, de M Noel Chabeuf, Charge du Projet a la Banque Mondiale.
2.                   La mission s'est rendue a Kindia, Dabola, Labe, Gaoual, Boke et Kamsar pour
visiter les actions conduites par la DNE et ses partenaires (Vetrinaires sans Frontieres, Projet
Transhumance), et rencontrer des groupements d'dleveurs constitues dans les differentes regions. La
mission a visite la foire de l'Elevage A Boke.
3.                   La mission exprime ses plus vifs et plus sinceres remerciements A Madame le
Ministre de ]'Agriculture, de l'Elevage et des Eaux et Forets pour les facilites logistiques apportees par la
DNE, la collaboration efficace et cordiale de ses cadres et la qualit6 des informations foumies.
OBJECTIF DE LA MISSION:
4.                   L'objectif de la mission est de rediger un rapport representant le bilan
institutionnel, technique et financier du Projet au moment de sa cloture. Il s'agit d'un exercice commun
entre l'emprunteur et la Banque, dont la presente mission ne represente que la deuxieme etape, la
premiere etant la preparation par la DNE d'une serie de documents. Le rapport de mission sous forme
provisoire sera adresse au Gouvemement Guineen pour observations et pour etre complete par la partie
relative au point de vue du Gouvernement sur le deroulement du Projet. Le rapport final d'achevement
du Projet sera constitue de l'ensemble de ces contributions.
CONSTATATIONS DE LA MISSION:
Constatations d'ordre g6n6ral:
5.                  Bien que ce Projet ait ete concu et ait debute dans des conditions macro-
economiques et socio-politiques peu favorables, les objectifs initiaux, pourtant relativement ambitieux,
ont e  atteints. Parmi les acquis techniques du Projet A l'issue de huit ans d'execution on peut souligner
particulierement les elements suivants:

(a)    la formation de 237 groupements d'e1eveurs sur 1'ensemble du territoire;
(b)    la consolidation des structures operationnelles de la DNE a travers (i) la
formation, (ii) I'achat de vehicules et (iii) la construction ou la rdhabilitation
d'une partie des bureaux locaux ( siege, SPRA et postes);
(c)    la distribution d'intrants pour l'elevage;
(d)    un important programme d'assistance technique;
(e)    la realisation des campagnes nationales de vaccination contre les grandes
epizooties qui touchent maintenant un demi million de bovins.
6.                    Les sacrifices considerables consentis par le Gouvernement au debut du Projet
en particulier pour la reduction des effectifs de personnels de la DNE, conjugues avec un effort soutenu
et tres rationnel de formation ont porte leur fruits. Ceci se manifeste dans la qualite des services fournis,
parfaitement percue par les beneficiaires, en particulier les groupements d'eleveurs, et les partenaires de
la DNE, qu'il s'agisse des Bailleurs de Fonds ou d'autres organisations (administrations, ONG, etc.). La
mission a pu constater la qualite de la contribution de la DNE a la preparation du PSA II, et a beneficie
elle meme d'un appui tres apprecie notamment pour la preparation des documents de fin de Projet.
7.                    Le Projet a bdneficie d'une cooperation exemplaire, continue et intense de
1'ensemble des Bailleurs de Fonds qui s'est manifestee des le partage des financements des differents
volets lors de l'evaluation, s'est poursuivie par des supervisions conjointes (FED, CFD, FAC, IDA), et
des interventiosn ponctuelles des uns ou des autres dans des periodes critiques (suspensions de
decaissements ou manque de fonds de contrepartie) pour assurer la continuite des activites du Projet.
8.                    Bien qu'entrepris a une epoque oui il etait difficile de determiner avec certitude
les priorites pour le developpment du sous secteur, le Projet permet a l'isssue de 8 ans d'etablir de facon
claire une strategie de developpement appuyee sur des donnees concretes. II dispose aussi de messages
techniques clairs en ce qui concerne la protection du cheptel national ainsi que l'integration de
I'agriculture et l'elevage et le developpement des filieres specialisees (aviculture, porciculture, lait).
CONCLUSIONS DE LA MISSION:
9.                    La continuation de l'effort porte sur le secteur de l'elevage s'effectuera dans le
cadre du PSA II. Ceci correspond a une option fondamentale commune du Gouvemement et des
Bailleurs de Fonds. Au moment de la cloture du PRSE, la DNE dispose d'une avance de plusieurs annees
par rapport aux autres directions du MAEF en matiere de competence technique et administrative,
comme cela a et constate lors de la preparation du PSAII. II apparait donc essentiel que les soucis de
coordination ne portent pas atteinte a la specificite des actions relatives a l'elevage.

10.                  La mission est confiante dans I'aptitude de la DNE et de ses partenaires
representants des eleveurs a concevoir et mettre en oeuvre les evolutions de la politique d'e1evage qui
s'avereront necessaires a I'avenir.
1I.                  La mission prevoit d'envoyer le projet de rapport d'achevement en langue
Fran9aise dans le courant du mois de janvier 1996. La contribution du Gouvernement sera attendue six A
sept semaines apres reception du document. Le rapport final sera pret un mois plus tard, soit, en principe,

Appendix B
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The project review from Borrower's perspective was spelled out on January 18 by the
Secretary General of the Ministere de l'Agriculture, de l'Elevage et des Forets in the following extract of
a speech delivered at the Ministry's New Year celebration:
" En ce qui conceme l'Elevage, permettez moi, Madame le Ministre, de rappeler
sommairement les conclusions de la mission d'achevement du projet qui s'est deroulee du 10 au 21
Novembre 1995; "Le PRSE a e  le mieux reussi parmi les programmes de restructuration de l1'levage
finances par l'IDA en Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre...pour citer M. Percival Bono, specialiste de
l'elevage, consultant de l'IDA. Puis il ajoute qu'au moment de la cl6ture du PRSE, la DNE dispose d'une
avance de plusieurs annees par rapport aux autres directions du MAEF en matiere de competences
techniques et administratives, comme cela a deja et constate lors de la preparation du PSA Il. Il apparait
donc essentiel que les soucis de coordination ne portent pas atteinte a la specificite des actions relatives A
l'elevage. La mission est confiante dans l'aptitude de la DNE et de ses partenaires representant des
eleveurs A concevoir et A mettre en oeuvre les evolutions de la politique de l'elevage qui s'avereront
necessaires A l'avenir. Fin de citation".
A mon humble avis, ces citations seraient suffisantes pour presenter le bilan de cette
direction.
Neanmoins, je voudrais citer quelques actions de portee nationale:
*  Le recensement national du cheptel; en attendant la saisie des cahiers de recensement, les resultats
globaux se presentent comme suit: 207.235 eleveurs, 2.186.954 bovins, 609.978 ovins, 738.436
caprins, 44. 729 porcins, 614 equins et 138 asins. Ces resultats denotent une augmentation
significative des differentes especes de 1988 A 1995 A 66,84% pour les bovins, 58,35% pour les
ovins, 63,76% pour les caprins, 115,67% pour les porcins, avec un accroissement des eleveurs de
8,9%.
*  La vaccination de 380.000 bovins contre la PPCB et 350.000 contre la DNCB, de 105.000 ovins et
caprins contre la PPR et de 44.000 volailles.
*  La realisation de 14 infrastructures de commercialisation du betail et de ia viande, la collecte de 110
tonnes de coton-graine, 52 tonnes de sous produits agricoles stackes, 50.000 animaux tatoues,
1'encadrement de 567 eleveurs de bovins, le contr6le de qualite de 116.000 carcasses de bovins,
16.000 carcasses de petits ruminants et 900 carcasses de porcins, l'octroi de 88.626.000 GNF A 18
promoteurs dans le cadre de la privatisation, 102 Millions de GNF A 18 promoteurs, toutes filieres
confondues, dont 12 Millions de subventions ont ete accordes dans le cadre des credits pilote PRSE,
la formation de 700 auxiliaires d'elevage et 500 eleveurs en sante animale et l'organisation de la
foire nationale de l'Elevage A Kolaboui sous votre presidence d'honneur, constituent la synthese de
quelques realisations de terrain.
Enfin, 76 agents ont beneficie de 3 sessions de formation au CFEL de Labe, 9 cadres ont beneficie de
stages A l'exterieur et 4 cadres ont participe A des voyages d'etudes A l'exterieur. This statement clearly
indicates the very positive assessment of project achievements by the Borrower's representative.
