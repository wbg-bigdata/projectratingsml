Odffienitw TeroE    From the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to GoPunjab on IDA
terms. From GoPunjab to the executing agencies under the fol-
lowing terms and conditions: (a) to WASA, GMC, SMC and MDA for
revenue earning assets (water supply and sewerage investments)
at an annual interest rate of 11  with a repayment period of 25
years including six years of grace; (b) to WASA, LDA, LMC, GMC,
SMC and MDA for all other investments including pilot projects
at an annual interest rate of 4S with a repayment period of 25
years including six years of grace; and (c) to the above agen-
cies for studies, technical assistance and training on a grant
basis. ODA financial assistance to GOP and GoPunjab will be a
grant, which will be passed on to WASA by GoPunjab on the same
terms and conditions as the IDA credit.
The overall goal of the project is to assist GoPunjab to pro-
vide Lahore and three other Punjab cities with a strong frame-
work for economic growth and development through improved
municipal management and resource mobilization, while meeting
basic shelter and service needs of the underprivileged and
protecting the urban environment. The project would finance
priority investments of the GoPunjab urban development program,
and comprise three groups of components: (a) in Lahore,
(i) upgrading of local urban services and cultural asset con-
servation of 130 ha within the Walled City and area upgrading
of 415 ha of low-rise developments in North East Lahore, to
benefit 250,000 people; (ii) city-wide incremental investments
to improve, rehabilitate and extend water supply,



- ii -
sewerage, sewage treatment, stormwater drainage and road
maintenance; (iii) traffic, road safety and bus services improve-
ment and support; (b) in three intermediate Punjab cities
(Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan), area and Walled City upgrading
of 190 ha (to benefit 50,000 people), and investment studies; and
(c) technical assistance for systems improvement in the municipal
finance and property tax sys- tems; project management; sector
institution training and strengthening; and preparation of future
investments in the Punjab cities. Equipment and technical
assistance for water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment would
be parallel-financed by ODA. The project would be implemented
over an eight-year period beginning in FY88. The total project
cost is estimated at US$145.2 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$47.1 million. The project represents
about 25% of the annual urban development expenditure for Lahore,
and an average of about 20X for the other cities.
and Risks        Area and walled city upgrading in Lahore will provide enhanced
development prospects for 250,000 people. Developments in the
three intermediate cities will meet short term shelter and
industrial infrastructure needs, strengthen city management, and
will provide GoPunjab with replicable experience for future
province-wide developments. The main beneficiaries of area
upgrading investments will be low income groups, mainly women and
children. The project will produce widespread urban environment
improvements through pollution reduction measures and urban
services upgrading, and will contribute to poverty alleviation
while enhancing economic growth. The project's principal risks
are associated with the implementation capacity of the executing
agencies and their ability to achieve cost recovery. The project
would minimize these risks by providing (a) measures and resources
for improving technical performance, local resource mobilization,
and cost recovery of key urban institutions in Lahore; (b) tech-
nical assistance in preparing and implementing area upgrading
schemes; and (c) strengthening and modernizing financial manage-
ment in the project cities. Technical aspects of the project are
conventional and do not pose significant risks. Political risks
for the project are associated with the commitments of GoPunjab
and the municipal corporations to levy increased water supply and
sewerage tariffs, since consumers may be reluctant to pay more
than the present subsidized rates. Assurances have been obtained
that the authorities recognize these risks, and are prepared to
resist the related pressures.

PAKISTAN
STAFP APPRArAL REPORT
PUNJAB URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
L BACKGROUND
A. Urban Develot in Pakistan
1.01     Thirty percent of Pakistan's 102 million people have annual incomes
which are below the absolute poverty level, defined as US$140 per capita. The
population growth rate is about 3.12 p.a., and the overall literacy rate 26S.
Industrial development and associated employment opportunities have caused
Pakistan's urban population of 31 million to grow at 4.11 per annum on average
between 1972 and 1981. compared to rural population growth of 2.12 per annum
during the same period. Continued growth at similar rates is expected, which
will result in an urban population of about 58 million (401 of total popula-
tion) by the year 2000. In order to maintain needed economic growth, urban
centers will be required to play an increasingly important role in economic
development by providing essential services, especially to the industrial and
agricultural sectors. The productive employment of a rapidly expanding urban
labor force will require substantial additions to urban infrastructure and
shelter. The adoption of mechanized and capital intensive methods in tha agri-
cultural sector will continue to reduce the demand for rural labour, driving
the displaced workers to urban areas for employment.
t
1.02     Urban population growth has far exceeded the provision of basic urban
services and infrastructure. Water supply is inadequate in most cities;
sewerage and solid waste disposal are generally inadequate; ineffective storm-
water disposal frequently causes major economic disruption and environmental
damage. Insufficient provision of serviced land and housing for more than
half of urban household formation has given rise to growing squatter or
"katchi abadi" settlements.
1.03     A number of issues should be addressed, as outlined below, in order
to avoid constraint of economic growth by (a) the inability of cities to
efficiently deliver essential services; and (b) the misallocation of the
limited resources available.
Urban Management
1.04     The performance of the public sector in providing urban infrastruc-
ture and services in Pakistan has been uneven. Targets for implementation of
land development and slum upgrading schemes have not been realized. Implemen-
tation capacity needs to be strengthened to meet the needs of the growing
population and to catch up with service deficits. Municipal capital expendi-
tures are budgeted only a year at a time, usually with insufficient regard for



-2-
subsequent fiscal impacts. Investment priorities should be given greater con-
sideration, and planning for financing capital projects should be strengthened.
In addition, increased attention should be paid to the financial and institu-
tional requirements of operating and m_intaining facilities, and local govern-
ments should develop greater capacity for managing services. Management
information system should be improved in order to identify problems and allow
timely intcrvention, and accounting systems should be strengthened to increase
their usefulness in controlling activities and in identifying the costs of
public sector activities.
Land Development
1.05     Though progress has been made on this recently, unnecessarily high
engineering and planning standards for land, housing and infrastructure have
resulted in development costs which are unaffordable to the great majority of
city dwellers and thereby have contributed directly to the proliferation of
slums. There is a need to review and revise the planning standards in order
to better utilize public funds and to extend housing and urban services to a
larger proportion of urban households, especially lower income groups. The
problem is aggravated by inequitable credit policies, uneconomic interest
rates, and requirements for downpayments and land tenure which have placed
formal housing finance out of reach of the majority of urban households.
Cumbersome land acquisition procedures, and methods for land development and
allocation limit access of low income householders to serviced sites. On many
area development schemes, plots are acquired as investments, and the housing
stock does uot increase. The recent repeal of the 1973 Land Acquisition Act
should bring about some of the improvements needed, and public sector organiza-
tions will have to acquire land at market prices under the 1894 Land Acquisi-
tion Act. However, while making prices more open to market forces, one effect
could be to restrict housing and area development by public authorities due to
shortage of funds.
Local Resource Mobilization
1.06     Even with reduced standards, the investments needed to cope with
urban growth will be enormous. In the late 1990s, about US$500 million will
have to be invested annually (about 2S of GDP) to fully meet the infrastruc-
ture and housing needs of the growing urban population. This compares with an
estimated development expenditure of US$174 million in FY86 and a projected
expenditure of US$265 million in FY87. Additional funds will also be required
to reduce present deficiencies in urban infrastructure. Although part of this
investment will be financed directly by both private and institutional
investors, the demands on the public sector to mobilize the remainder needed
will be substantial. Urban governments will be required to finance most
services - both investment and operations and maintenance costs - with
locally-generated funds, because budget transfers from the provincial govern-
ment will not be available in the long run. In formulating programs tu
mobilize additional local government revenues, officials should focus on:
(a) increasing revenues from existing taxes and charges, including
octroi ^', property tax, and vehicle taxes; and (b) expanding reliance
U/ A form of local customs duty or entry tax levied on goods entering urban
areas.



on direct recovery of the costs of providing urban services through charging
for water supply, sewerage, plot development, slum upgrading and public
transport.
Government Programs
1.07     Government of Pakistan (GOP) does not currently have a stated urban
development policy. However, housing development policy as stated by the
Prime Minister is that every shelterless person should have a living place
where "he can reside with a sense of possession and peace of mind". Urban
development is undertaken by provincial Housing and Physical Planning
Departments (HPPDs), a number of specially-created development authorities,
municipal authorities and by local govero4ent; the Federal Environment and
Urban Affairs Division plays a coordinating role. GOP is addressing the
issues raised above through a series of initiatives. Financial allocations of
Federal and Provincial resources are made annually through the Annual Develop-
ment Program (ADP), and channeled through the HPPDs and municipal and develop-
ment authorities. In some cases such as Karachi, additional "special" funding
or non-ADP allocations are made to the sector. The Prime Minister's Five
Point Program plans to commit Rs 3,500 million (US$206 million) between 1986
and 1990 to improve katchi abadis to serve about 5.5 million people. The
Prime Minister has recently announced a further program to create one million
homes for the shelterless. The Seventh Plan is expected to focus more sharply
than before on urban development. However, 3ector policy needs strengthening
and urban development programs will need careful formulation in order to meet
the growing needs effectively.
B. Urban Development in the Puniab
The Province
1.08     The Punjab is an alluvial plain of 205,000 square kilometers traversed
by five major rivers (the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlaj). Pakistan
has four provinces: Sind, Punjab, Baluchistan and North West Frontier. The
Punjab is the most populous, with an estimated population of about 56 million
(June 1987) of which 17 million or 30% live in urban areas. The greatest popu-
lation concentration is in Lahore (estimated population 3.7 million). Unlike
the other provinces of Pakistan, Punjab has a number of large and rapidly
growing cities including Faisalabad (1.4 million), Gujranwala (1.0 million),
Sialkot (0.4 million) and Multan (0.9 million) that have become centers of
rapid economic growth through industrialization and provision of services and
marketing facilities to the agricultural sector. The province is divided into
eight administrative divisions, and has an extensive network of power lines,
roads, railways and irrigation canals. Irrigated agriculture has up to now
been the main economic activity in the Punjab.
1.09     Rapid population and urban growth have caused a severe strain on the
cities. Services are inadequate, land needed for urban development is scarce
and city administration is not able to keep pace with the growth. The pro-
vincial government believes that growth can be supported and promoted in the
secondary cities as well as Lahore, reducing pressure on the capital while



- 4 -
improving services and economic efficiency province-wide. Also, the scope for
local resource mobilization should be broader if opportunity is taken to
develop province-wide programs.
Urban Development Institutions in Puniab
1.10     Five Government of Punjab Departments play a major role in urban
development. The Planning and Development Board (P&D) evaluates public
investment programs and controls the Annual Development Program (ADP) funding
allocation. The Housing, Physical and Environmental Planning Department
(HPEPD) undertakes physical and investment planning, provides technical
leadership and administers the development authorities. The Transport Depart-
ment controls the main supplier of public transport, Punjab Road Transport
Corporation (PRTC), and regulates the industry. The Local Government and
Rural Development Department (LGRD) oversees local authority activities, and
the Excise and Taxation Department (E&T) administers the excise and taxation
system, collecting and distributing property tax to the local authorities.
C. The City of Lahore
1.11     Lahore, the capital of the Punjab, is located on the east bank of the
river Ravi, situated on the vast Punjab alluvial plain close to the border
with India (IBRD Map 19964). The city's origins date back more than a
thousand years. From an old fort on the banks of the Ravi and seat of the
local Hindu rulers, it became a fortified city under the Afghans and Turks,
and spread beyond the walls to include a number of suburbs and gardens. The
city flourished as a regional center umder the Muhgals in the seventeenth and
early eighteenth centuries but fell into decline in the ensuing huneted years.
It was taken over by the British in the mid-nineteenth century and became an
important industrial and commercial center. Many of its historical landmarks
still exist, particularly the Walled City and Muhgal forts, although many are
in a serious state of overcrowding and physical deterioration. Because Lahore
is the historical and cultural heart of Pakistan, there is keen interest
throughout the country to preserve its religious and architectural heritage,
and arrest the environmental damage and decay, which the project will address
(paras. 4 and 8 of Annex 1).
1.12     Lahore's population growth has averaged 3.72 per annum over the past
decade giving rise to a sprawling, rapidly expanding city of 3.7 million
(June 1987) with a crowded historical center, and low density settlements on
the outskirts; densities in the Walled City average 1,100 persons per hectare.
The city's population is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 3.72
in 1982-1990, 3.4% in 1991-2000 and 3.0% in 2001-2010. Growth is physically
constrained to the north and west by flood protection bunds along the Ravi.
The total area is about 1,800 sq. km. Average annual rainfall is 490 mm,
two-thirds falling July through September. Mean monthly temperatures range
between 12 degrees and 34 degrees C. The city is low-lying and flat, which
causes many areas to be flooded in the rainy season.
1.13     Lahore has well-developed agricultural service and manufacturing
activities and a substantial pool of skilled manpower and entrepreneurial
talent. It is the country's major center for textiles, carpets, engineering



and machinery industries, many of which are relatively small-scale. The
metropolitan area provides employment to about 1.1 million people, the major
source of urban emp!oyment in the Punjab. The surrounding urban system,
including the intermediate cities, is relatively well-integrated, but the
region needs improvements in transportation and comiunication between urban
centers.
Administration and Finance in Lahore
1.14     Planning and land development in the Lahore Metropolitan area is the
prime responsibility of the Lahore Development Autbority (LWA), which falls
under the Department of Housing, Physical and Environmental Planning (HPEPD),
GoPunjab. The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), an autonomous agency under
LDA, is responsible for the provision of water supply, sewerage and storuvater
drainage collection and disposal. Municipal services in the urban area are
provided by the Lahore Metropolitan Corporation (LMC, area 404 sq. km) and the
Cantonment Board (area 87 sq. km). LDA coordinates the planning and develop-
ment of essential urban services by other agencies, including the provision of
electricity by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and natural
gas distribution by SUI Gas. HPEPD also has responsibility for environmental
protection and control.
D. PuAiab Interediate Cities
1.15     The cities of Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan are three of the most
important and most rapidly growing secondary cities in the Punjab, with the
following characteristics:
Mid-1987    Estimated Current Annual
Population           Growth Rate
Gujranwala                     1.0 m              7.3S
Sialkot                        0.4 m              4.7%
Multan                         0.9 m              3.62
The three cities have obsolete master plans (dating back to 1971), and are
faced with similar problems of rapid population growth taking place in uncon-
trolled and unplanned manner, and further constrained by an inability to
generate sufficient municipal resources for adequate services.
1.16     Gujranwala owes its rapid growth to being located on the Trans-Asia
Grand Trunk Road, and its strategic position in the agricultural heartland of
the Punjab. The city has a strong manufacturing base in iron, eteel, electri-
cal goods and ceramics and provides services for the adjacent agricultural
sector. Gujranwala has a small walled city.
1.17     Sialkot is located close to the Pakistan/India border. The city
dates back at least 1,500 years as a local capital, and is known for its light
manufacturing industry, particularly sporting goods and stainless steel sur-
gical instruments; most output is exported. City growth has probably been
restricted due to proximity to India; the city was involved in defensive
engagements during the 1965 war.



1.18     Multan is the major city of southern Punjab.  It has long been a
cultural centre and historic city, and was captured by Alexander the Great in
327 BC. Major rail and road links pass through the city. It has a rich
architectural heritage, including a classic but densely populated Walled City
of some 100 hectares. Due to lack of services and maintenance and inadequate
drainage and sewerage, part of the building stock in the Walled City has
deteriorated badly. The city is a major service and marketing centre for the
agricultural industry and has a strong tanning industry. Considerable growth
took place in Multan following partition of the subcontinent in 1947, and it
has remained an important city since. There are a number of smaller but
rapidly growing cities in the Punjab which will play an increasingly important
role in economic development. The most important are Sargodha, Sahiwal,
Bahawalpur and Rahim-Yar-Khan.
E. Service Levels
1.19     Investment in service institutions  in Lahore has been significant
over the past decade. However, the city's growth has continued to exceed
capacity to keep pace with requirements, and all services are deficient.
Water supply in Lahore is from pumped groundwater. The WASA supply area
covers about 3.1 million (83X) of the 3.7 million population, of which an
estimated 2.5 million are supplied by WASA and 0.6 million make their own
arrangements (private tubevells and hand pumps-there are very few public
stand posts) or are unserved.  The remaining 0.6 million (17X) are served by
other agencies (including the Railways and the Cantonement Board). Average
per capita usage is about 81 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) gross, includ-
ing losses, estimated at about 402. In high density areas, usage is about 50
gped after losses. Supplies have, over the past two to three years, become
intermittent in parts of the city due to wastage (such as excessive consump-
tion by non metered consumers) and inadequate maintenance due to shortage of
funds. In spite of this, the Lahore water supply is among the better ones in
the region. Per capita consumption is high mainly due to (a) availability;
(b) religious use; and (c) wastage by domestic consumers.
1.20     Sewage and sullage (greywater) disposal is through a mixed system,
comprising sewers, combined sewers, sullage collection drains and storm drains.
Flows are pumped into the River Ravi, or gravitate (with pumping in times of
flood) through sullage collectors to the river. An estimated 90% of the
population have access to disposal systems which fall under WASA; however less
than half of the flows are piped, the balance flowing through open channels
and in places mixed with stormwater, presenting a major health hazard. Much
of the present piped sewerage system is old and requires rehabilitation,
particularly in the central area of Lahore. WASA is working towards separat-
ing flows where it is economic to do so.
1.21     Secondary and tertiary stormwater drainage in Lahore has been badly
neglected. A recent study of major road-related drainage found that most
facilities were non-functional due to poor construction and/or being badly
clogged and in some cases damaged due to lack of maintenance, or did not
connect to the trunk system. This is particularly noticeable in the city
during periods of rain when many streets are flooded with consequent com-
mercial disruption, damage and losses.



- 7 -
1.22     Solid waste management presents a major challenge to the LMC, given
the congested traffic conditions and poor drainage. However, under the ongoing
Credit 1348-PAK, LMC is investing in vehicles, equipment and improved facili-
ties to handle solid waste, and it has recently streamlined its labour
management practices. These changes will improve service levels. Also, urban
services in 50 ha of the Walled City were improved under Credit 1348-PAL. In
the remaining 130 ha of the Walled City, buildings are decaying and living
conditions are extremely congested and unhealthy due to constrained access,
inadequate sewage and garbage disposal, and poor water supplies.
1.23     Over the past decade, the rapid growth in population and vehicle
ownership in Lahore has steadily worsened traffic congestion. Total vehicle
registrations have increased from 14 per 1,000 inhabitants to over 35 per
1,000 inhabitants (cars have increased from 7 to 12 per 1000). Congestion is
particularly bad in central areas, with peak hour delays of 20-30 minutes.
Also, the mix of motorized traffic and the slower animal-drawn vehicles and
bicycles is a major factor contributing to congestion. Many parts of the
system have rpached capacity, whereas on main reads traffic is projected to
grow at between 7 and 8.51 p.a. Improper designs of road links and intersec-
tions cause disorderly conditions, and, on any given day, over 50S of the
traffic signals may be out of order. Traffic safety is poor and driver
behavior often undisciplined, which is further aggravated by poor signing and
road marking. In 1985, 232 persons were killed and an estimated 14,000
injured by traffic accidents in Lahore. The rate of fatalities per 10,000
registered vehicles is over 10 times higher than in major cities of indus-
trialized countries. The deterioration in traffic conditions and poor road
safety contributes to economic loss and considerable disruption to city
efficiency.
1.24     Shelter demands are substantial.  The current estimated growth in the
requirement for new housing in Lahore is 22,000 residential plots per year,
and the present housing backlog is 130,000 units. LDA provided some 60,000
residential plots over the last ten years, and the private sector an estimated
20,000 plots; LDA intends to provide 40,000 serviced plots over the next five
years (8,000/yr) and the private sector about 15,000 plots (3,000/yr). There
will be a shortage of about 300,000 plots in the year 2,000 due to limited
financial resources, in spite of considerable efforts by LDA and the private
sector. In the three intermediate cities, housing backlogs are equally
serious.
The Intermediate Cities
1.25     Services in the intermediate cities have not kept pace with develop-
ment, and planning and municipal administration have lagged behind city
needs. The current estimated service levels are as follows:



Guiranwala         Sialkot              Multan
Water Supply              25S access to     25X access to       50S access to
piped supply      piped supply        piped supply
Sewerage                 20S piped;         50S piped;          751 have access
balance open      balance open        to open drain or
drainage          drainage            piped system;

Traffic                  very heavy         heavy congestion   congestion
congestion
Serviced Housing
Land                   not available      not available       not available
1.26     Water supply is from tubewells; where public supplies are not avail-
able, handpumps or private tubewells are installed. Sewage is collected
either ia limited piped systems (which are in many cases blocked through poor
maintenance or dumping of solid waste) or in open drains, and pumped or gravi-
tated to fields, water courses or open spaces. There is no sewage treatment.
Stormwater flows are generally combined with excreta disposal flows.  Storm-
water disposal presents a major problem in all three cities.  The corporations
operate solid waste collection systems; equipment is lacking, and tipping
sites where available have limited life spans.
1.27     The poor water, sanitation and solid waste services are responsible
for major inconveniences and unsanitary conditions, and contribute to ill-
nesses such as dysentery and hepatitis (affecting children in particular),
loss of productive capacity, and environmental damage. Traffic congestion
affects goods distribution and productivity of buses and minibuses.
1.28     Master plans and investment programs need updating.  Before this can
be done, base mapping, which is badly out of date, will require improving.
The other intermediate Punjab cities of Sheikhpura, Sargodha, Sahiwal,
Bahawalpur and Rabim-Yar-Khan, though smaller, have similar problems. GoPunjab
and the local authorities have decided that a start should be made in the
immediate future to begin to address these problems through mapping, master
planning, and investment programming interventions, coupled with improved
local resource mobilization to finance the improvements.
F. resource Mobflization and Cost Recovery
1.29     Lahore has been relatively unsuccessful at resource mobilization.  In
FY86, the equivalent of about US$11 per capita was levied for services. This
compares with US$14 in Karachi in FY84, but is less than half that of compar-
able East Asian cities. In the 1980s, octroi growth has been poor, and water
and sewerage rates and charges have decreased in real terms. In the



- 9 -
intermediate cities, where services are provided, tariffs are inconsistently
applied and bear little relationship to costs or service levels. The total
excise and property tax collection in Punjab between FY83 and 86 declined in
real terms per urban inhabitant from Rs6l to Rs59 per capita (in FY83 terms).
Numerous inconsistencies and anomalies exist in the current property tax
procedures. Bus fares are heavily subsidized, and the PRTC and Lahore WASA
are two of the major causes of GoPunjab's increasing budget deficits.
1.30     Until recently, a major lost opportunity for local resource genera-
tion had been in land pricing, where land developed by LDA was acquired below
market value according to the 1973 Land Acquisition Act, and sold on a "no
profit/no loss" basis; this caused developed land to be sold well below market
value, undercutting the private sector, and yielding capital gains to a few at
the cost of the public sector. The 1973 Act has now been repealed, and land
now has to be purchased at market price, which will create tinancirg diffi-
culties for the development authorities. The project will address these
resource mobilization and cost recovery issues through policy changes and
improvements in financial management skills (paras. 4.03-4.07).
G. Role of DDA in Pakistan's Urban Development
1.31     IDA involvement in Pakistan's urban development has taken the form of
support for projects in Karachi and Lahore; sector work; dialogue on urban
issues at the national, provincial and local levels; and studies on urban
management, housing finance, and national human settlements policy. The objec-
tives of IDA involvement in the sector is to help strengthen local agencies,
increase local resource mobilization, and promote the adoption of more effi-
cient systems for providing urban infrastructure and services. In the past,
city-specific projects have been the primary means of pursuing this objective.
1.32     The first two credits in the sector financed water supply and sewer-
age improvements in Lahore. The first, a US$1.75 million credit (Cr. 106-PAK),
became effective in 1967; the Second Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and
Drainage Project, a US$26.6 million credit (Cr. 630-PAK), became effective in
1976. The principal objectives of these projects were to assist the develop-
ment of a financially sound water and sewerage agency for metropolitan Lahore,
improve levels of service, and help prepare an urban project. The Water and
Sanitation Agency (WASA), established in 1977, successfully completed the
second project, and although its initial financial performance was disap-
pointing, it later improved through an operational action plan prepared in
1982, incorporating specific steps and objectives for operational and finan-
cial improvement (see Annex 2, para. 13). The agreed performance targets were
subsequently achieved, as reflected in the recently prepared Project Comple-
tion Report (Report No. 6204). WASA has, however, fallen short of its
financial objectives for the past two years due to GoPunjab reluctance to
increase tariffs.
1.33     In 1984, a US$25 million credit (Cr. 1374-PAK) for improvement of
Karachi's bulk water supply system became effective. As in Lahore, the
project supports the strengthening of an autonomous water and sewerage agency
for metropolitan Karachi. During project preparation, the Karachi Water and
Sewerage Board (KWSB) was established and an operational action plan was



- 10 -
devised for the new agency. The plan is currently being implemented satis-
factorily on technical matters; financial performance is below target due to
tariffs not being increased.
1.34     IDA's first credit for a multi-sector urban project in Pakistan, the
Lahere Urban Development Project, also became effective in 1984. The US$16
million credit (Cr. 1348-PAK) finances: (a) upgrading in Lahore's Walled City;
(b) sites and services development; (c) improvements to solid waste manage-
ment; and (d) housing finance.  The project objectives are to demonstrate
low-cost shelter policies, to arrest the decay in urban living conditions, and
to strengthen the two project implementing agencies, the Lahore Metropolitan
Corporation (LC) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA). The House
Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) is included as a project intermediary,
providing finance to low-income beneficiaries for house construction and
repair. Implementation has proceeded slowly on the area development and
housing finance components. The Walled City upgrading was completed satis-
factorily, and progress on solid waste management improvement is adequate. The
area development component has been delayed due to land acquisition
difficulties.
1.35     IDA's second credit for a multi-sector urban project, the Karachi
Special Development Project (KSDP) was provided in late 1985. The US$70
million credit (Cr. 1652-PAK) finances a series of subsector interventions in
Karachi, combining specific institutional and financial measures with physical
improvements in water supply and sewerage, flood control and stormwater
drainage, transportation, katchi abadi upgrading, solid waste management and
improvements to resource generation and municipal management. Strengthening
of the project agencies (the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board - see para. 1.33
above; the Karachi Municipal Corporation; the Karachi Development Authority;
the Karachi Transport Corporation and Government of Sind) is a key component
of this credit, which is parallel-financed with the Asian Development Bank
(ADB). Implementation of the IDA-assisted components is proceeding, and
agency performance is satisfactory.
1.36     The principal lessons learned through these projects are that (a)
project agencies generally do not have the authority to increase tariffs and
charges, and provincial authorities have demonstrated a lack of willingness to
make necessary increases; (b) implementation capacity has been over-estimated
during preparation; and (c) executing agencies need technical and management
strengthening to be more effective at service delivery and city management
this should be done as an integral part of project implementation. These
lessons should be taken into account in new lending operations.
H. New Juitatives
1.37     The Bank's sector assistance strategy builds on past work and focuses
on selected policy issues. Emphasis will be placed on developing the policies
and institutions needed to effect large scale implementation of concepts
proven in earlier, smaller-scale operations. Emphasis will also be placed on
investment programming and capital budgeting in order to improve the alloca-
tion of resources among municipal functions such as transport, land develop-
ment and water supply. The allocation of roles for local governments,
parastatal organizations and private enterprises in supplying particular



- 11 -
services will be examined, and institutional arrangements will be developed to
allocate capital assistance to these institutions as required in order to meet
demands for services most efficiently. The use of national and provincial
apex organizations to appraise, help finance and supervise local investments
will be considered as a long term option. Assistance to the two largest
cities will continue, but in addition, assistance will be offered increasingly
to intermediate cities, particularly in the Punjab and Sind Province. At the
national policy level, the Bank will draw upon the results of past sector work
in providing advice on resource mobilization and utilization related to
housing, urban transport and municipal finance.
1.38     GoPunjab is facing major challenges in the urban sector.
Rapidly-growing cities have serious service deficiencies and need continued
support and institutional strengthening to adapt to rapidly changing
circumstances. The cities represent opportunities for economic growth and
political stability. Lead institutions are in place, and with improved
management and focused programs, are well suited to continue to implement
development programs. GoPunjab has identified mechanisms to improve local
resource mobilization, and thereby decrease the reliance on federal and
provincial resources, which currently contribute significantly to the budget
deficit.
1.39     An urban investment program for the Punjab together with specific
policy initiatives, was prepared in outline in mid-1986 by GoPunjab. It has
subsequently been refined, drawing on lessons learned from ongoing
Bank-assisted programs (see para. 1.36), and designed to support urban-driven
economic growth. In addition to investment in Lahore, a start would be made
with pilot investments in three intermediate cities. This preparation and
refinement has involved participation of all the sector agencies, and has been
coordinated by the GoPunjab Planning and Development Board (P&D). The pro-
posed investments would support a city-wide series of manAgement, institutional
and paysical improvements phased to correspond to institutional capacity, set
in a framework of strengthened policies for resource mobilization.
1.40     Project formulation has been undertaken closely with the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom. ODA assisted in
preparing the project, and will, subject to completion of their normal pro-
cessing requirements, finance a part of it under parallel financing
arrangements.
EL THE PROJECT
A. Obieetives
2.01     The project objectives are to assist the Government of Punjab
(GoPunjab) to:
(a) improve technical, financial and management performance of key
urban institutions in Lahore, and strengthen local government
institutions in Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan;



- 12 -
(b) improve cost recovery in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan,
achieving efficient and sustainable resource utilization;
(c) demonstrate the value of coordinated area upgreding;
(d) reduce urban services deficits in water supply, sewerage and
drainage, traffic control and shelter;
(e) improve the quality of life and productive capacity of the urban
poor, and protect the urban environment; and
(f) prepare the framework for a futaire Punjab intermediate cities
project.
2.02     The project would enable GoPunjab to achieve these objectives through
investments at provincial and city level in water supply and sewerage; storm-
water drainage; transportation; area upgrading and conservation; and financial
management. The project will combine financial and institutional improvements
in parallel with physical investments in new works, infrastructure rehabilita-
tion and upgrading consistent with the objectives. The project would reduce
the dependence of local governments on transfers from the federal level, help-
ing contain the growth of fiscal deficits. Technical assistance, human
resource development and studies will play a key role at both provincial and
executing agency level, strengthening capacity and providing a framework for
improved city services and economic growth.
2.03     Lahore is Pakistan's second city and together with the larger cities
in Punjab (Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan) plays a central role in the economy.
Improving the management of urban institutions, mobilizing local resources,
managing effective cost recovery systems, and extending basic services to
cities and towns outside the major metropolitan area would require long-term
efforts and sustained support from both the Federal Government and IDA. The
project would play an important role in IDA's country strategy through improved
resource mobilization and providing infrastructure services essential for
industrial and economic growth. The physical investments would have a signi-
ficant, positive impact on the urban environment, reducing pollutant sources
and improving treatment and disposal.
B. Description and Cost Estimates
2.04     The project will finance priority investments of the GoPunjab urban
development program and will comprise of three groups of components:
(a) for Lahore: (i) upgrading of local urban services (water,
sewerage, stormwater drainage, roads and footpaths, street
lighting) and cultural asset conservation of 130 ha within the
Walled City and area upgrading of local urban services of 415 ha
in North East Lahore to benefit some 250,000 people;
(ii) city-wide incremental investments to improve, rehabilitate
and extend water supply, sewerage, sewage treatment, stormwater
drainage and road maintenance; (iii) traffic, road safety and
bus services improvement and support;



- 13 -
(b) for three intermediate Puniab cities Gujranwala, Sialkot and
Multan, area and Walled City upgrading of local urban services
and related infrastructure (water, sewerage, stormwater
drainage, roads and footpaths, street lighting) in 190 ha to
benefit some 50,000 people, and investment studies; and
(c) trainina and technical assistance for improvements in the
municipal finance and property tax systems; project management;
sector institution training and strengthening; base mapping; and
preparation of future investments in the Punjab cities. Equip-
ment and technical assistance for water supply, sewerage and
sewage treatment would be financed by ODA.
2.05     In parallel with these investments, GoPunjab will implement institu-
tional and financial improvements in the sector agencies to increase urban
services efficiency and increase local resource mobilization through enhanced
water and sewerage charges and property tax.  A detailed description of each
component is provided in Annex 1, and summarized in Table 1, Annex 1, which
also lists: (a) the agencies responsible for implementing the components; and
(b) the associated institutional and financial improvements.
2.06     Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at
Rs 3,295 million (US$145.2 million equivalent) excluding interest during
construction. The foreign exchange component is Rs 1,070 million (US$47.1
million) or 32S of total project costs. Taxes and duties are estimated at
Rs 140 million (US$6.2 million). Summary estimates are given in Table 2.1,
and detailed estimates are shown in Annex 2. Full details are contained in
the project file. :
2.07     The base cost estimates of t1e project components reflect price
levels prevailing at end-1987. The estimates have been based on preliminary
and in some cases final designs, and generally on the costs of recent similar
works carried out in Lahore and elsewhere in the Punjab. In a few cases, the
Government Schedule of Rates has been used and updated to reflect prevailing
recent tender experience. Estimates for materials, equipment and vehicles are
based on recent quotations from manufacturers. Design and supervision costs,
including departmental costs, are generally estimated at 7% of the cost of
works. Physical contingencies of 101 have been allowed for civil works, and
5S for equipment and services.
2.08     Price contingencies for foreign costs are based on international
inflation estimates of +5.7%, +5.5%, +2.0%, and +1.02 for years FY87 through
FY91, respectively, and +3.0% thereafter. Domestic inflation rates are
estimated at +7.51, +7.01, +6.01, +6.0% for years FY88 through FY91, respec-
tively, and +3.0% thereafter. Price contingencies have been calculated in
accordance with Bank guidelines and amount to 23.21 of the total estimated
project rupee cost.
C. C-rrent Investment Levels
2.09     Investments in urban infrastructure are financed mostly by property
tax, property transfer tax, octroi, water and sewerage tariffs and provincial
government allocations through the GoPunjab Annual Development Program (ADP).

The current level of urban infrastructure public sector investment in Lahore,
is about Rs 900 million/year. Average annual investment in the project at
1987 prices will add about Rs 300 million. Given that the projected annual
investment is likely to remain at about this level during the peziod FY8s
through FY96, the project would finance about 252 of Lahore's total annual
development expenditure. The proportion in Gujranwala would be 202, in
Sialkot about 35X, and in Multan about 62. These investment levels are
considered to be within the financial capacity of both the executing agencies
and GoPunjab, and manageable by the constructior. and professional services
industry. The investments would contribute to improving service levels; the
resource mobilization and cost recovery programs would enhance revenue in the
medium term for the province and the agencies.
D. Financing Plan

External financing will be provided by IDA (US$90 million) and in parallel by
ODA (US$19.9 million).  This US$109.9 million will finance 762 of the esti-
mated project cost total of US$145.2 million or 792 of the total net of taxes
and duties. It will cover 1002 of foreign exchange costs and 642 of local
costs. ODA will finance equipment and technical assistance for the Lahore
WASA under parallel financing, as an integral part of the project. IDA will
assist in financing the remaining components. GoPunjab will provide the
estimated remaining US$35.3 million for the project, and to the extent neces-
sary, an estimated US$9.6 million of interest during construction to WASA.
2.11     The flow of funds planned is shown in Annex 3.  The IDA credit of
US$90 million will be made available to GOP on standard IDA terms. The ODA
Development Grant of US$19.9 million (equivalent to about UKE 11.5 million)
will be a grant to GOP. Both will be passed on to GoPunjab on the terms and
conditions on which they were received. GoPunjab will pass on the project
funds of US$145.2 million as follows:
(a) US$11.9 to the Project Management Unit (PMU) for (i) mapping and
planning and financial studies; (ii) project management and
training; and (iii) future project preparation.
(b)  US$7.5 million through the PMU for the execution of: (i) area
developments in Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan.



- 16 -
(c)  US$1.2 million through the PMU to: (i) the Department of Excise
and Taxation for execution of property tax enhancements; and
(ii) the Punjab Road Transport Corporation for execution of
management and operational strengthening activities.
(d) US$77.1 million to the Lahore WASA for: (i) improvements to
water supply, sewerage, sewage treatment, and storowater
drainage; and (ii) technical assistance and studies. Of this,
US$19.9 million equivalent will come from the ODA parallel
financing.
(e)  US$44.4 million to the LDA for execution of: (i) Walled City
upgrading and conservation; (ii) large scale area upgrading
(N.E. Lahore); (iii) traffic engineering and transport improve-
ments and studies; (iv) technical assistance in upgrading
traffic and financial planning; (v) mapping and future project
preparation.
(f) US$3.1 million to the LMC for: (i) road rehabilitation and
drainage equipment and (ii) technical assistance in plant
operations and maintenance, and in financial management.
2.12     The proceeds of the IDA credit will be passed on by GoPunjab under
the following terms and conditions: (a) to WASA, Gujranwala Municipal Corpor-
ation (GMC), Sialkot Municipal Corporation (SMC) and the Multan Development
Authority (MDA) for revenue earning assets (water supply and sewerage) at an
annual interest rate of llS with a repayment period of 25 years including six
years of grace; (b) to WASA, LDA, LMC, GMC, SMC and MDA for all other invest-
ments including sewage treatment and pilot projects at an annual interest rate
of 42 with a repayment period of 25 years including six years of grace; and
%c) to the above agencies for studies, technical assistance and training on a
grant basis. Design and supervision costs of project components will be
included in items (a) and (b) as appropriate. GoPunjab will bear all foreign
exchange risks. ODA financial assistance to WASA will be passed on to WASA by
GoPunjab on the same terms and conditions as the IDA credit. GoPunjab ori-
ginated funds will be passed on to the agencies on the same terms and condi-
tions. The signing of subsidiary loan agreements between GoPunjab and the
implementing agencies will be a condition of Credit Agreement effectiveness.
HL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Management and Execution
Prolect Management Unit
3.01     Overall project management, monitoring and coordination would be
undertaken by a Project Management Unit (PMU), established within the Housing,
Physical and Environmental Planning Department (HPEPD) in collaboration with
the Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRD) of GoPunjab. The
PHU, which would be an integral part of HPEPD, would monitor 4iplementation of
the operational action plan (para. 3.05) and the achievement of cost recovery



- 17 -
targets and policy measures. It would, as part of HPEPD, in collaboration
with the respective directorate, execute provincial-level studies, coordinate
trairing and ensure project-wide quality, consistency and performance.  The
PMU would routinely update each agency's work schedule, coordinate operations
among the agencies, ensure the timely availability of resources, maintain
records of disbursement applications and payments, and prepare periodic
reports for review by IDA and Government. The PMU would be responsible for
the preparation of possible future projects in the Punjab and the preparation
of a Project Completion Report (PCR) within six months of the closing date of
tne proposed Credit. The PMU would be staffed by a Director General, already
appointed, supported by directorates of Engineering (from HPEPD staff), and
Finance and Administration (from LGRD) with 6 senior professional staff backed
up by 30 clerical and support staff. It would work closely and integrally
with existing HPEPD units (Public Health Engineering, and Housing and Physical
Planning). Project management and public finance advisory consultants would
be appointed to support the PMU during the first four years of implementation.
3.02     Policy and technical guidance on implementation would be provided by
the interdepartmental PUDP Policy Committee (PPC), which has been set up by
the GoPunjab Planning and Development Board (P&D) in conjunction with the PMU
in the HPEPD with representation from the line departments and the executing
agencies. The PPC, chaired by the Chairman of the P&D, would be the PMW and
project-level review body.
Execution Responsibilities
3.03     The execution of each project component would be undertaken by the
following agencies:
Executing        External

- 18 -
3.04     The technical assistance includes technical support to project agen-
cies, a number of major consultancy studies, base mapping and preparation of
future investments. It would be provided by consortia of local and interna-
tional consultants, since local consultants do not have all of the specialist
personnel required. The remaining detailed engineering, bid document prepara-
tion, procurement and project site supervision would be undertaken by the
agencies with assistance from consultants. Local consultants have been found
to perform adequately for many kinds of engineering work; however, procurement
experience has proved unsatisfactory in some cases and specialist expertise
would be required for some components. It is estimated that about 50X of the
design and supervision work would require consultants who would mainly be
local firms in consortia with international firms.
Operational Action Plan
3.05     The implementation of physical improvements and policy measures would
follow a number of key dates for taking specific policy actions and completing
particular physical improvements. These actions and improvements are grouped
into an Operational Action Plan (OAP-details in the Project File) which would
(a) enable the monitoring of the physical progress of PUDP; and (b) assist the
achievement of its policy objectives. Agreement was obtained from the execut-
ing agencies at credit negotiations that: (a) the targets and dates contained
in the OAP are realistic and will be met; and (b) during project implementa-
tion, the OAP would be reviewed annually and updated in agreement with IDA.
Implementation Status
3.06     Final designs and bid documents are complete or in an advanced stage
of preparation for the first two years implementation of area upgrading in
N.E. Lahore, traffic engineering, and stormwater drainage, covering some 201
of civil works. Final design of water supply reticulation is complete, and
preliminary engineering complete for stormwater drainage and sewerage treat-
ment. It is expected that contracts of US$4 million for the first phase of
area upgrading in N.E. Lahore, and for road, water supply and stormwater
drainage improvements, will have been awarded by June 1988. The PMU has been
established, and its Director General and senior staff appointed. Terms of
reference for major technical assistance and consultancy design assignments
have been prepared and reviewed. Consultants proposals will be invited in
late FY88. It is expected that most of the major assignments will have com-
menced by late-1988.
B. Implementation Schedule
3.07     Project implementation is expected to take eight years, with final
commissioning of some minor items before the end of the ninth year. This is
shown in Annex 5 (scheduling completion June 30, 1996). While some Punjab
agencies have shown themselves to be efficient in execution and should be
supported in aiming for a shorter period, unforeseen delays have been allowed
in calculating price contingencies, and in making the financial analysis and
the economic evaluation, based on the implementation schedule shown in
Annex 5. This is considered reasonable based on recent experience with the
urban sector in Pakistan and on GoPunjab performance to date.

C. Procrmeut
3.08     Procurement for all IDA-assisted components would take place in
accordance with che Bank Guidelines. ODA-assisted compotents in WASA would be
procured in accordance with ODA guidelines. Civil works contracts would
generally be awarded through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures which
do not preclude international participation. Technical assistance and major
consultancy services would be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants. Contracts for specialized vehicles and equipment
would generally be awarded under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) pro-
cedures. Existing local (LCB) bidding procedures of the implementing agencies
have been reviewed. While the review showed that the procedures generally
ensured adequate competition, encouraged economy and efficiency and did not
preclude foreign bidders from participating in locally advertised bidding,
other aspects of the procedures of the various agencies require strengthen-
ing. Time for bid submission, evaluation criteria to ensure the highest
ranking (evaluated) responsive bid wins and not necessarily that bid with the
lowest price, and public bid opening arrangements would need to be made con-
sistent with the Bank's guidelines. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that Bank procurement guidelines will be complied with, and that for
LCB, particular attention will be given during project execution to the
aspects noted above.
3.09     Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.1 below.  Con-
tracts of about US$63.1 million would be awarded through LCB, while contracts
for about US$18.4 million would be awarded through ICB.
Civil Works
3.10     The estimated cost of civil works is US$69.8 million inclusive of
contingencies. The civil works for the sewage treatment plant would be pro-
cured through ICB (estimated at US$10.2 million). The balance of the civil
works would be procured through LCB, since foreign bidders are not expected to
be interested because of the small, scattered nature of the works. Works
would be grouped into packages of about Rs 20-30 million (averaging approxi-
mately US$1.2 million equivalent) to try to attract the large, experienced
local contractors, and avoid the administrative costs that the processing of
numerous small contracts would entail. Prequalfication of contractors will be
carried out by all agencies for contracts in excess of Rs 5 million (US$0.3
million equivalent at time of appraisal). For components including area
upgrading, Walled City upgrading, water supply, drainage, and sewerage
improvements where construction can be phased incrementally, contracts would
comprise a one- or two-year time slice of the longer-term programs; there
would be an estimated 50 main civil contracts.

3.11     The concept of area development has been applied in the design of the
area upgrading components. For implementation, these components would be
grouped in 'area' type rather than 'service' type civil works contracts in
order to: (a) minimize the period of disruption; (b) maximize the impact of
the completed improvements; (c) improve coordination; and (d) involve only a
one-time reinstatement of road surfaces. For the large trunk infrastructure
works where various subsector works (water supply mains, drainage channels and
sewerage and road rehabilitation works) are to be constructed in the same area
through different agencies, the PMU would ensure that project works are con-
structed together and in proper sequence.
Vehicles and Equipment
3.12     A sum of US$25.1 million equivalent inclusive of contingencies is the
estimated cost of goods, specialized vehicles and equipment to be procured.
Of this amount, equipment costing US$8.2 million is to be procured in ten
packages through ICB under Bank Guidelines, principally for road maintenance
and traffic signals. A margin of preference of 5l of CIF value of imported
goods or the applicable customs duty and import taxes, whichever is lower,
would be extended to domestic manufacturers in bid evaluation. For the



- 21 -
ODA-assisted components, contracts for equipment and materials totalling
US$13.4 million will be awarded under ODA procurement guidelines, while con-
tracts for equipment totalling US$3.5 million will be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding. This includes such items as office machinery and
road safety equipment, in relatively small quantities which would not attract
the interest of foreign suppliers. Credit proceeds will not be disbursed
against conventional non-specialized vehicles, as under GOP regulations these
are reserved procurement items.
Design, Supervision, Training, and Technical Assistance
3.13     Consulting services and technical assistance would be procured from
firms and individuals with qualifications acceptable to IDA and in accordance
with agreed terms of reference; consultants shortlists and terms of reference
would be subject to prior review by IDA. The cost of consulting services and
incremental in-house design and supervision costs, technical assistance and
training is estimated at US$31.2 million inclusive of contingencies. Of this
sum, a total of US$6.5 million, the technical assistance requirements of WASA,
would be funded by the ODA and procured according to ODA guidelines.  Part of
this technical assistance will be a twinning arrangement whereby WASA will
enter into a long term arrangement for support and training with a British
water authority/consultant consortium. The remaining consulting services,
technical assistance and training (US$21.9 million) will be for the other
implementing agencies and the PMU, and will be procured in accordance with
Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. US$19.1 million of this would be
for technical assistance, planning studies and major mapping work. This
includes 790 local and 650 international man-months direct technical assist-
ance. US$2.8 million would be provided for consultants (local or local with
international collaboration) undertaking design and supervision to be locally
procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines. US$2.8 million would be provided
to cover incremental in-house agency design and supervision costs.
Contract Review
3.14     For IDA-assisted components, equipment contracts above Rs 5 million
(US$0.3 million), and civil works contracts above Rs 10 million (US$0.6 mil-
lion) would be subject to prior review by IDA. This arrangement would cover
about 801 of the total value of all IDA-assisted equipment and contracts.
Post review of the remainder would be undertaken. All agencies have agreed to
base bid documentation on the World Bank Sample Bidding Documents.  The PMU
will play a lead role in document standardization and procurement monitoring.
Procurement review of ODA-assisted components would follow ODA guidelines.
D. Land Acquisition
3.15     A sum of US$12.9 million equivalent has been estimated for the cost
of land acquisition. Most of the components do not require land; for those
that do, some is already in the ownership of the implementing agencies or com-
prises small parcels (such as for tubewell sites). A large area of land in
two sites is required for the sewage treatment plant facilities. Consultants
studies funded by ODA have shown waste stabilization ponds to be the most
effective solution to sewage treatment for Lahore on both technical and



- 22 -
economic grounds. Through the project, 616 hectare (ha) of land outside the
flood protection bund will be acquired for the proposed South West (Multan
Road) Sewage Treatment Plant and inlet channel, and 44 ha for the future
Shadbagh Sewage Treatment Plant and feed culvert in North East Lahore. This
land is being acquired by GoPunjab in preparation for the project to ensure
that treatment can be undertaken in an orderly phased manner. Before negoti-
ations, the two sites were declared "Controlled Areas", the first step in
acquisition proceedings. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a) acquisition proceedings have been initiated; (b) notification required
under the 1894 Land Acquisition Act has been completed; and (c) provision will
be made for securing possession and preventing subsequent uncontrolled squatter
occupation of the sites. Land acquisition would not present relocation issues
as there are no permanent dwellings in these areas.
E. Operations and Mintenane
3.16     Executing agencies which undertake the construction of project com-
ponents will obtain prior agreement with future owner agencies on component
design and specification, and the latter will assume responsibility for opera-
tion and maintenance of assets once completed. Facilities constructed by one
agency for which maintenance responsibility is with another will be handed
over in an orderly and finished state to the maintaining agency. This coordi-
nation and transition will be managed by the PMU (para. 3.01). Assurances
will be obtained at negotiations that agencies will assume responsibility for
maintenance of their components.
F. Disbursements and Spechd Acecounts
3.17     On the basis of the proposed implementation schedule (Annex 5 and
para. 3.07), disbursements would continue for nine years. This is consistent
with the regional disbursement profile, and with GoPunjab's budgetting and
planning process. Disbursements from the IDA credit would be made net of
duties and taxes on the following basis:
(a)  79% of expenditures for civil works;
(b)  1002 of foreign expenditures, or 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory), for goods and equipment procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB);
(c)  50% of expenditures for goods and equipment procured through
local competitive bidding (LCB); and
(d)  100l   of expenditures on consultants services, incremental
in-house agency design and supervision costs; technical assist-
ance and training; and PMU costs.
3.18     Disbursements will be fully documented except for payments for
locally procured items of equipment costing US$50,000 or less and civil work
contracts of US$100,000 or less. Such disbursements will be made against
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), the documentation for which will not be
submitted to IDA but retained and made available during the course of project
revXew missions. It is estimated that US$18 million will be disbursed through



- 23 -
SOEs. Retroactive financing will be provided to cover eligible local rupee
expenditures up to Rs 70 million incurred after June 1987.
3.19     To ensure that project activities are carried out promptly, the
Government will open and maintain in US dollars Special Accounts with the
National Bank of Pakistan for (a) GoPunjab, (b) LDA, (c) WASA, (d) LMC. and
(e) MDA, to facilitate expenditures by each executing agency. The opening of
the account will be done in accordance with procedures and on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to IDA. Most IDA-financed expenditures will be made through
the Special Account. The initial total deposit by IDA into the Special
Accounts will represent IDA's estimated share of expenditures for four months.
Replenishments will provide for four months expenditures and be made on the
basis of withdrawal statements submitted by the executing agencies. The PMU
will coordinate the management of the special accounts. Disbursements are
projected to continue until March 31, 1997, the proposed Credit Closing Date,
i.e. four quarters after the end of the expected eight-year implementation
period. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 6.
G. Accounts and Audits
3.20     Separate project component accounts will be maintained by each of the
executing agencies involved, giving breakdowns for land acquisition; civil
works; vehicles and equipment; consulting services, technical assistance and
training. The project expenditures will be accounted for separately by cate-
gory for each fiscal year. The PMW (para. 3.01) will have the responsibility
for collecting project accounts from the executing agencies, reviewing them
and arranging annual audits by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The
annual audits of project accounts including SOEs, Special Accounts, and Pro-
ject Accounts for all implementing agencies will be submitted to IDA within
six months after the close of each fiscal year.
3.21     LDA, WASA, LMC, GMC, SMC, and MDA will prepare and submit to IDA
within six months after the close of each fiscal year fully audited accounts
for the agency covering all operations, undertaken by auditors to the satis-
faction of IDA.
H. Monitoring. Evaluation and Reporting
3.22     Each executing agency will submit brief monthly progress reports to
the PMU, which will make recommendations on any corrective actions considered
necessary to ensure that project component objectives, implementation sche-
dules and budget Limits are met. Based on the monthly reports and its own
supervision and controls, the PMU will prepare quarterly reports on the pro-
gress of the project highlighting any major problems and suggestions for
overcoming them. The quarterly reports setting out physical and financial
data regarding each component, will be submitted to the interdepartmental PUDP
Policy Committee (PPC) and IDA within one month following the end of each
reporting quarter. For the first two years, the PPC will formally review PUDP
every six months, and thereafter at least annually unless progress is below
expectation, in which case more frequently.
3.23     The PMU will establish reporting formats and monitoring indicators,
and will develop evaluation techniques to measure progress in meeting



- 24 -
physical, financial, institutional and program goals, and ultimately to
measure project achievements, all to be acceptable to IDA. The monitoring
procedures and format will be periodically reviewed with IDA and updated as
necessary. The PHU will prepare a draft Project Completion Report (PCR) at
the end of the project.
L Project Accounts
3.24     GoPunjab will open, replenish and maintain project accounts for the
executing agencies, through which GoPunjab funds will be channeled. GoPunjab
will also make the necessary arrangements to ensure that funds and other
inputs are available in a timely manner for the ODA-financed components.
IV. FUTURE FINANCES AND AFFORDABLUITY
4.01     Central to meeting project objectives is the requirement to provide a
better framework than presently exists for both resource mobilization and cost
recovery. The costs of the project's water supply and sewerage components
will be recovered directly from beneficiaries through water and sewerage
tariffs and charges. Investment costs in other areas of infrastructure and
Walled City upgrading will be recovered indirectly through property taxes
which accrue to the municipal corporations and the Lahore WASA. The costs of
investments comprising conservation, technical assistance and studies will be
recovered indirectly through GoPunjab taxes. Annex 3 summarizes the recovery
mechanisms.
4.02     The project design aims to improve provincial and municipal resource
mobilization by increasing revenues through (a) increased service coverage;
(b) improved levels of service which will increase property values and hence
property tax revenues; (c) property tax collection improvements (see
para. 4.08); (d) implementing and effectively managing economically efficient
water and sewerage tariffs (see paras. 4.03 to 4.06); and (e) property tax
enhancement (see para. 4.08). Measures to reduce expenditures in the project
agencies will also improve municipal resources. The principal measures will
be: improved budgetting and cost control; management and systems improvement,
particularly in WASA, LDA and MDA; and market-oriented land pricing by LDA and
MDA.
A. Water and Sewerage Charges - Lahore
4.03     Water supply and sewerage costs in Lahore will be recovered through a
broad-based enhanced tariff. Over the past five years, WASA has suffered from
poor provincial fiscal policy under which tariffs have declined in real terms;
this has led to the poor financial position of WASA. GoPunjab has decided to
rectify this tL-.ough the project, aiming to restore WASA's long-term financial
viability. Agreement was obtained at negotiations, that a phased tariff and
financial restructuring package will be implemented. The financial package
will comprise: (a) increasing tariffs annually by approximately equal annual
percentages through FY91 to achieve for FY91 and subsequently maintain at
least a 3.52 rate of return on revalued fixed assets in operation; (b) restruc-
turing WASA's capital by converting to equity by end-FY88 at least 332 of



- 25 -
WASA's long-term debt; (c) from FY92 onwards, the tariffs will be adjusted
annually by the amount of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) percentage increase
during the previous year plus a minimum of 7.5X, to enable WASA to contribute
cash from internal operations to reach a positive cash position by FY95, and
meet at least 10 in FY96 and at least 20X in FY97 and beyond of its three-year
(defined as past, estimated current, and estimated subsequent year) moving
average annual capital investment requirement. The tariffs will be set to
ensure that basic services are affordable to all income groups, and that
existing tariff inconsistencies are eliminated. A sewerage rate will be
implemented for all consumers who have access to sewerage, as a surcharge on
the water bill. The existing sewerage rate for bulk consumers will increase.
Sewerage rates will be levied on consumers who use private water supplies but
the WASA sewerage system. Drainage charges will increase, and for the first
time an acquifer charge will be levied on private tubewell abstractions.
Revenues will grow by about 272 p.a. through FY91, while costs wll increase
by less than 192 p.a., based on the efficiency improvement program proposed.
Financial projections for WASA are provided at Annex 8.
4.04     Domestic metered connections currently pay Rs 3.20 per 1,000 gallon,
which will increase by 302 to Rs 4.16 with the first increase. The comparable
commercial consumer rate will increase by 851 from Rs 4.70 to Rs 8.70 per
1,000 gallons. The average unmetered connection currently pays Rs 418 per
annum [Rs 35 per month] which will increase by 302 to Rs 543 per annum [Rs 45
per month]. An increased sewerage surcharge will be added to each, giving
Rs 4.64 per 1,000 gallons for domestic metered, Rs 9.70 per 1,000 gallons for
commercial metered and Rs 605 per annum [Rs 50 per month] for the average
unmetered connection. Subsequent annual increases thereafter (through FY96
and beyond) will be 152 for domestic, and 302, eventually being reduced to 202
for commercial consumers. It is estimated that water supply accounts for
about 502 of current WASA expenditures; production costs are thus about Rs 2.6
per 1,000 gallons delivered. The proposed adjustments to the tariff over the
next five years combined with WASA system and management enhancements (see
Annex 4, paras. 9-15) will improve economic efficiency and equity, while
keeping services affordable (see para. 4.10).
4.05     WASA will continue to receive its share of property tax revenue as a
contribution to stormwater drainage provision. Linking the WASA tariff
adjustments to the CPI after FY91, and granting WASA the authority to adjust
tariffs within limits in combination with rigorous performance targets, will
reduce the need for financial allocations from GoPunjab.
B. Water and Sewrage Charges - lntermediate Cities
4.06     Current tariffs bear little relation to supply costs or service
levels.  There is no consistent water and sewerage charging policy in the
Punjab.  Tariff adjustments will be implemented in Gujranwala, Sialkot and
Multan.  The levels will be established in consultation with LGRD and P&D, and
will aim to achieve equity while achieving full cost recovery. Agreement was
obtained at negotiations that the three cities will prepare, in consultation
with IDA by not later than end-FY90, and thereafter implement an improved
dated program satisfactory to IDA for levying water and sewerage charges
related to supply costs. Improvements to the accounting and financial manage-
ment systems will enable the tariff program to be implemented. Financial
projections for the Intermediate Cities are provided at Annex 11.

C. Cbes for Area U       Dpadg and Traffic Infstruture
4.07     In North-East Lahore and in the areas to be upgraded in the inter-
mediate cities, properties are generally owner occupied, or if not developed,
have been sub-divided into small lots. In the Walled City of Lahore,
owner-occupancy is over 85X. Currently, many water connections are illegal or
unrecorded, and wastewater flows haphazardly disposed of with no means of
charging the source. The impact of environmental, health and service level
improvements will be substantial. Water and sewer services will be greatly
improved, and householders will be charged. Other infrastructure costs will
be recovered indirectly through property taxes and municipal charges, and
charges by LDA on sales from its development portfolio. Agreement was
obtained at negotiations that IDA and MDA will adopt a land pricing policy
which will (a) achieve and maintain an overall financial surplus and
(b) include provisions for financing non-revenue generating investments while
achieving an overall financial surplus (see also Annex 7). Financial pro-
Jections for IDA and MDA are provided at Annexes 7 and 10, respectively.
D. Property Tax
4.08     The vital role property tax plays in providing municipal resources
will be supported through the project. Base mapping will greatly improve the
data base for tax assessment and collection, and pilot programs will explore
the scope for property tax efficiency improvements and strengthening. Only
372 of properties in Lahore currently pay tax due to exemptions; all public
buildings including those owned by medical, religious and educational institu-
tions are exempt.   The identification and removal in stages of many anomalies,
inconsistencies and inequities identified during project preparation together
with improved working conditions and staff training will give further scope
for enhancement. Property values are reassessed every five years; assessed
values typically increase by about 502. It is estimated that property tax
revenue could increase by at least 202 (or Rs 70 million) annually for the
first three years of the program. The proposed Metropolitan Management and
Finance Study will further assist in identifying resource mobilization options,
and explore rationalization of service provision responsibilities. Financial
projections for LMC are provided at Annex 9.
E. Bus Fares
4.09     PRTC is currently making strenuous efforts to reduce revenue leakage
and improve operational efficiency. The technical assistance component in the
project will assist GoPunjab to prepare a strategy for public transport
including resource mobilization.
F. Affordability
4.10     The most significant increase in charges which consumers will have to
bear directly will be in water and sewerage tariffs. From published data and
GoPunjab statistics, current household income levels in Lahore are estimated
to be as follows: (a) lower quartile-Rs 1300/month; (b) median income-Rs 1950
per month; and (c) upper quartile-Rs 3450/month. The data probably under-
estimate actual income from all sources, and are thus considered to be



- 27 -
conservative. Consumers can be expected to be able to pay between 3 and 42 of
income for water and sewerage services. For services to be affordable to the
lower quartile income group, bills in 1988 should be less than Rs 52 per
month. Bills with the increased combined tariff will be less than Rs 50 per
month for 772 of households. In upgrading areas, where property tax is paid,
it is typically between Rs 10 and Rs 30 per month-this could increase by up
to 202 or Rs 6 per month, which is less than 0.5S of income. Where property
taxes are not paid, the increase in outgoings will be about Rs 10-15 per month
or less than 1S of household income. The impact of the increase in property
tax will be relatively minor to the lower income groups. The very poor social
groups are catered for through the Zukat Mustahaqeen system of Islamic charity,
and are thus ensured basic needs.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RLSKS
A. Economic Evaluation
5.01     Economic rates of return have been calculated for components with
meaningfully quantifiable benefits including water supply, sewerage, storm-
water drainage, traffic engineering and area upgrading. These components
represent 82% of the project's cost, and have an average rate of return of
202. The project would also yield significant non-quantifiable benefits.
Water. Sewerage and Stormwater DrainaRe
5.02     Quantification of all of the benefits of the water supply and sewer-
age investments is not practical, and incremental revenue has been taken as
the most practical indicator of benefit. Parts of the program (such as meter
replacement or installation, and main rehabilitation) would give very high
rates of return. Much of the sewerage system is a combined system, and hence,
investments would have benefits greater than stormwater drainage improvements
(see below).  The latter give rates of return of about 22X.  The estimated
rate of return on the incremental water and sewerage investments would be at
least 111.
5.03     The direct benefits of stormDater drainage improvements would be
savings in vehicle user costs; savings in property and road maintenance costs;
reductions in commercial disruption; savings in sewage pumping costs and in
seasonal pumping from low lying areas. The rate of return from these benefits
is estimated to be 22X. Non-quantifiable indirect benefits would include
major environmental improvements, reducing insect breeding grounds leading to
improved public health; upgrading of property value; reduced losses of produc-
tive time; and reduction of damage to underground telephone lines.
Area Upgrading
5.04.   Area upgrading in North East Lahore and the intermediate cities would
give benefits of increased property values and increased property rentals.
Property value increases would also yield capital profits and increased pro-
perty taxes. The North East Lahore pilot scheme showed that service improve-
ments encouraged at least 501 of households to invest in property



- 28 -
improvements, giving further property tax revenue gains and housing stock
improvements. The rate of return considering only the increase in rental
income is estimated to be 171 in Lahore, and of a similar magnitude in the
intermediate cities. Significant unquantifiable benefits of improved health
and productivity would also accrue, principally to lower income groups in the
upgraded areas in Lahore and the three intermediate cities.
5.05     The benefits of the Walled City upgrading and conservation would be
improvements in property and hence rental values, and major environmetal
improvements. The rate of return considering only the increased rental income
is estimated to be 162 for these investments. Other potential benefits include
restoration of commercial activity in abandoned areas, and the restoration of
housing stock, which is at a premium in the Walled city; of less tangible
value is the benefit to society at large of bringing back to use historically
important cultural assets. Not undertaking the upgrading and pilot conserva-
tion program would continue the loss to Pakistan of items of religious, cul-
tural and architectural value, and of housing stock.
Traffic and Transport
5.06     The traffic and transport component has been designed to improve
traffic flow and safety in the road transport corridor. Alternative road and
traffic investments were ranked according to cost (to account for agency
implementation capacity); improvements in carrying capacity; and impact on
traffic management strategy, traffic safety and public transport. Major
benefits considered were time savings and fuel savings (valid in central
areas). For the typical larger link road improvements, rates of return were
between 53% and 802; for typical traffic improvement schemes the rates of
return were over 50X. It is estimated that, not including safety improvement
benefits, the rate of return of the traffic and transport component would be
in excess of 50%. There would be additional benefits of higher service
levels, greatly improved safety, and improved and less polluted urban enviro.a-
ment and lessened congestion.
5.07     The benefits of rehabilitation and maintenance improvements to the
road systems would principally be reduced vehicle operating costs and reduced
travel time. Rates of return for typical improvements were found to be in
excess of 552, usually over 100%.
B. Impact on the Poor and on Women
5.08     The area and Walled City upgrading in Lahore, Gujaranwala, Sialkot
and Multan in the project, which accounts for 15% of project costs, would
directly benefit low income communities, including those below the poverty
threshold level. The water supply, sewerage and drainage component would,
through improved coverage and carefully designed tariffs, meet basic needs of
the poorer groups. City-wide investments (improving traffic and support to
the Punjab Road Transport Corporation) would also indirectly benefit these
groups. Women and children who bear the brunt of household level deprivation,
and are the most exposed to the hazards of poor water supply, exereta disposal
and drainage, would be the main project beneficiaries.



- 29 -
.
C. Evinenta  Imp
5.09     The inadequate stormwater drainage, sewerage, and solid waste
disposal systems in the project cities are creating an increasingly deteri-
orating and noxious environment. Raw sewage flows through ill-defined
watercourses partially clogged with decaying solid waste, creating risks of
acquifer pollution and health hazards. The broad infrastructure investment
programs, including the first sewage treatment facility in Lahore, would
reduce pollution and yield significant environmental improvements. The River
Ravi would act as a receiving body for sewage effluent flows. Sewage treat-
ment would aim at preventing river dissolved oxygen levels falling below 2
milligrams per litre, regarded as a minimum level to support aquatic life,
while maximizing the river's treatment potential.
5.10     Project components would have substantial positive environmental
impact. The sewage treatment and storm drainage components would yield the
most improvements; provision of water supply, sewage collection and road and
footpath paving would create an improved public health environment. In the
intermediate cities, though investments are localized in pilot upgrading
projects, urban quality of life would improve significantly. The project
focus on upgrading in the intermediate city schemes as well as in Lahore would
give broad-based cost-effective environmental improvements.
D. Risks
5.11     The principal risks are the capacity of the executing agencies to
implement a project of this complexity, and the ability of GoPunjab and the
municipal corporations to achieve cost recovery. The project would address
these risks by providing measures and resources for: (a) improving technical
performance, local resource mobilization, and cost recovery of the partici-
pating urban institutions; (b) technical assistance in preparing and
implementing area upgrading schemes; (c) strengthening and modernizing finan-
cial management in the project cities; and (d) project management. Technical
aspects of the project are conventional and do not pose significant risks.
The PMU has been created and given strong administrative and technical backing
in order to lead management and coordination. Political risks would be posed
to GoPunjab and the municipal corporations by their commitment to levy
increased water supply and sewerage tariffs, since customers may be reluctant
to pay more than the present subsidized rates. Assurances would be obtained
at credit negotiations that the authorities recognize these risks, and are
prepared to deal effectively with them.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During the credit negotiations, agreements were obtained from the
Government of Pakistan, GoPunjab, and the implementing agencies that:
(a) project implementation will be carried out in accordance with an
agreed Operational Action Plan, which will be annually reviewed
and updated in consultation with IDA (para 3.05);



- 30 -
(b) terms and conditions of funds flow, counterpart financing, and
relending will be acceptable to IDA, and counterpart funds will
be made available (paras. 2.10 to 2.12);
(c) the PMU will send quarterly progress reports to IDA within one
month of the end of each quarter (para 3.01);
(d) the proposed financial package for WASA will comprise: (i) annual
tariff increases by approximately equal annual percentages
through FY91 to achieve for FY91 and subsequently maintain at
least a 3.52 rate of return on revalued fixed assets in opera-
tion; (ii) restructuring WASA's capital by converting to equity
by end FY88 at least 33X of WASA's long-term debt; and
(iii) from FY92 onwards, the tariffs will be adjusted annually
by the amount of the Consumer Price Index percentage increase
during the previous year plus a minimum of 7.5S, to enable WASA
to contribute cash from internal operations to reach a positive
cash position by FY95, and meet at least 10% in FY96 and 202 in
FY97 and beyond of its three-year (defined as past, estimated
current, and estimated subsequent year) moving average annual
capital investment requirement (paras. 4.03 to 4.05).
(e) GoPunjab will prepare and implement before end-FY89 a program to
ensure WASA has the proper authority to carry out day-to-day
operations (Annex 4, para. 14);
(f) a dated program satisfactory to the Association to enhance water
and sewerage charges will be implemented in Gujranwala, Sialkot
and Multan by not later than beginning FY91 (para. 4.06), which
will aim to achieve full cost recovery in the respective cities;
(g)  land required for sewage treatment plant facilities in Lahore
(Multan Road and Shadbagh) through 1997 will be in Goverment
possession by not later than December 1988, and thereafter main-
tained in full possession (para. 3.15);
(h) LDA and MDA will adopt a land pricing policy which will ensure
an overall financial surplus, and will include provisions for
financing non-revenue generating investments (para. 4.07);
(i) adequate arrangements and procedures will be implemented to
ensure that assets constructed under the project are effectively
operated and maintained by the sector agency responsible
(para. 3.16); and
(j) project executing agencies will remain adequately staffed
throughout project implementation (Annex 4).
Conditions of credit agreement effectiveness were agreed to be:
(a) the signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between Government of
Punjab and LDA, WASA, LMC, GMC, SMC and MDA;



- 31 -
(b) project approval by the Executive Comeittee of the Nati@ial
Economic Council (EMNEC); and
(c) fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of
the funding agreement with ODA.
6.03     Having reached the above agreements with GOP, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 65.9 million (US$90
million equivalent) on standard terms with 35 years maturity. The borrower
would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

36 km of new and replacement distribution mains would be constructed in paral-
lel with a wastage reduction program, to selectively strengthen supply at
growth points, concentrating on revenue generation and service level mainte-
nance. Leak detection and repair programs would complement the distribution
system enhancement. Consumer metering would be extended and the central work-
shops rehabilitated, including provision of spares and equipment for rehabili-
tation and improved maintenance practices. Some 37,600 new meters would be
financed by ODA (para. 5) replacing about 18,800 existing broken meters and
metering some 18,800 additional consumers; matering will rise from 17Z of
connections in 1987 to about 21Z in 1992. The existing reservoir in the
Walled City would be renovated, a high-level reservoir of 4,500 cubic meters
constructed in northern Lahore, and the local supply area monitored to esta-
blish improved system management practices. The component would increase
supply to meet city growth, reduce operations and maintenance costs, increase
revenue, and improve service levels and water quality.
2.       Sewerage -WASA (US$10.1 million).  The sewerage system in central
Lahore is in need of rehabilitation, and in filling is required to meet city
growth of recent years; thus a series of incremental investments have been
identified, mainly in the older and also more crowded and poorer areas.  Some
116 km of trunk sewers and laterals (1,750 to 225 mm dia) would be constructed
in six service districts and two pump stations to serve northern and northeast
Lahore (designated Khokar Road and Mamood Bhooti). In the central sewerage
district, extensive rehabilitation would be undertaken and the Main Outfall
pump station extended. Sewer system maintenance capacity would be strength-
ened through the provision of equipment and standby generators provided at
select pump stations. The component would reduce operations and maintenance
cost and improve service levels, revenue and access to sewerage. A study and
pilot field trials of low-cost sanitation options would be undertaken.
3.       Stormwater Drainage -WASA (US$10.5 million).  The Lahore stormwater
drainage system has deteriorated badly in places, portions of trunk collectors
are missing due to haphazard and uncontrolled development, many parts are
overloaded, and secondary and tertiary drainage systems have not been
1/ Excluding design and supervision, (US$4.4 million) physical and price
contingencies.

constructed or not connected to the primary system. Some 115 km of storm-
drainas would be constructed, remodeled or rehabilitated, working in six drain-
age zones. A major pump station would be constructed at Siddiquipura and a
number of small low lift pump stations for low lying areas; in parallel with
the drainage program and the traffic engineering component (see para. 6) would
be a road gully construction program to improve road drainage, and a study to
establish the scope for separating sewerage and sturmwater flows.
4.       Sewage Treatment-WASA (US$19.8 million).  Lahore has no sewage
treatment-after meandering through the city (in open drains in many cases),
sewage is pumped over the flood protection bund into the River Ravi, causing
environmental damage and creating health hazards.  Stabilization ponds have
been identified as the cost-effective technical solution for the climate.
Treatment is required in two locations, in south west Lahore (Multan Road) and
northern Lahore at Shadbagh. A sewage treatment plant providing primary
treatment comprising anaerobic ponds covering 75 hectares would be constructed
at Yultan Road, together with conveyance channels and a pump station; the land
for constructing secondary treatment for 1997 flows would be acquired at this
site (see para. 3.15). The land for future anaerobic ponds and access chan-
nels at Shadbagh would be acquired under the project and pumping capacity
expanded; sewage would in the interim be pumped into the Ravi untreated at
Shadbagh.  Later an anaerobic pond treatment plant would be constructed at
Shadbagh and secondary treatment ponds at Multan Road.
5.       Technical Assistance and System Rehabilitation Equi   ent-WASA
(US$15.7 million). In WASA, the physical plant and many aspects of management
systems have suffered from shortage of funding; in particular, financial allo-
cations for operations and maintenance have not kept pace with requirements
over the years and many of the assets are badly deteriorated. Management and
technical skills, and commercial practices have been unable to grow to meet
service obligations. ODA would finance an investment package designed inte-
grally with the above program focusing on institutional strengthening and the
provision of specialized rehabilitation equipment. The institutional
stren-gthening would comprise:
(a) consultancy services through twinning over a five-year period
with a water utility and associated sector specialists in the
United Kingdom to provide (i) strengthening of management,
operations and maintenance, and project planning and engineer-
ing; (ii) support to WASA in-house design and construction
supervision activities for the WASA PUDP investment program; and
(iii) financial and computer systems improvements.
(b) consultancy services to assist system improvements through
(i) WASA system mapping; and (ii) a feasibility study, pilot
field trials and detailed engineering design and supervision of
a rehabilitation program for the central sewerage district; and
(c) detailed engineering design and construction supervision of
(i) the Multan Road sewage treatment plant; (ii) rehabilitation
of existing sewage pumping stations (civil, electrical and mech-
anical); and (iii) electrical and mechanical plant at two new
pump stations (Khokar Road and Mamood Bhooti).



- 34 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 7
The rehabilitation equipment would comprise the following items for incorpora-
tion into the physical investment programs described above (paras. 1-4):
(a) mechanical and electrical plant for sewage pumping at the two
treatment plant (Multan Road and Shadbagh) pump stations;
(b)  mechanical and electrical plant for rehabilitation and equipping
of sewage pump stations at Main Outfall, Gulshan E Ravi, Multan
Road, Khokar Road, and N. East Lahore (Mamood Bhooti);
(c) equipment to support the rehabilitation of water supply, sewer-
age and drainage operations including vacuum trucks, sewer
cleaning and sludge handling equipment, and office equipment; and
(d) supply of 9.6 km large diameter (750 through 450 mm dia) ductile
iron pipes and specials, and some 37,600 water meters for bulk
supply system management and improved consumer metering.
Detailed costs are shown in Annex 12.
6.       Traffic and Transport-TEPA/LDA (US$18.1 million).  The increasingly
congested traffic conditions in Lahore would be improved by the implementation
of a 70 km comprehensive road link program including the provision of traffic
signals, intersection channelization, road medians, selective road widening,
bus lanes, bus bays, street lighting, and pedestrian and non-motorized facili-
ties. This would be supported by selected intersection improvements including
channelization, pavement marking and traffic signing, improving safety condi-
tions of pedestrians and bicyclists, and bus and service vehicle access to
poorly-served areas, together with road-related stormwater drainage.
7.       Area Upgrading - Northeast Lahore-LDA (US$5.8 million).  Many parts
of Lahore have developed without adequate infrastructure but with well defined
and registered property boundaries, and skeletal services. Population densi-
ties are high, income levels low and environmental conditions very poor.
Large areas of this type exist in northern Lahore. To gain experience in
extensive upgrading, building on pilot work undertaken through Credit
i         1348-PAK, a phased program has been prepared for Northeast Lahore.  Upgrading
some 415 ha, to benefit about 150,000 people in six phases, would include
provision at minimum standards of affordability of piped water supply to
individual houses, stormwater drainage, sewerage, solid waste collection and
disposal, surfacing of gallisl' and secondary streets, street lighting and
community facilities.  Considerable emphasis would be placed on community
participation throughout implementation.
8.       Walled City Upgrading Phase II and Conservation-LDA
(US$7.0 million). Fifty hectares of the Walled City were successfully
upgraded through Credit 1348-PAK (designated Phase I). Phase II, in the
remaining 130 hectares, would comprise: (a) upgrading of water supply,
1/ Streets or walkways too narrow for vehicular access.



- 35 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 7
sewerage, stormwater drains, paths and roadways, electricity and street light-
ing, related secondary and trunk infrastructure, and traffic management; and
(b) improvements to leak detection and repair, and solid waste collection.
Typical construction details are shown in Annex 11. Conmunity participation
would be central to implementation, monitoring and evaluation. An innovative
pilot conservation program would comprise: (a) repair and restoration of
selected buildings and areas of historical and architectural value, to serve
as demonstrations and gain conservation experience; (b) restoration, repair or
construction of eight schools and two commtunity center facilities; and (c) a
program of information and technical assistance to householders in building
repair and on-site infrastructure improvements. Stormwater, sewerage, roadway
paving and conservation would bring local environmental quality improvements.
Parallel-financing outside the project is being sought by GoPunjab with IDA
support from the Aga Khan Trust to complement the investment in Phase II.
Pilot conservation and technical skills are being sought through a collabora-
tive agreement (outside the project) with the Smithsonian Institute in the
U.S.A.
9.       Road and Drain Maintenance-LMC (US$2.1 million).  LMC capacity and
equipment to undertake roads and drainage maintenance is inadequate. A
modest-sized investment would modernize plant and equipment including hot mix
plant, paver, tipper trucks, loaders and rollers and essential spare parts.
Consultants would prepare bid documents and assist with procurement. This
would be complemented by technical assistance to strengthen: (a) works manage-
ment and operation capacity, and on-the-job training; and (b) planning, pro-
gramming financial management and budgeting capability (see para. 17). Main-
tenance workshops are being improved under Credit 1348-PAK.
10.      Pilot Upgrading and Environmental Drainage Scheme in Guiranwala
.-CMC/HPEPD (US$2.1 million). Services are inadequate in much of this rapidly
growing and industrially important city. The project would finance through
upgrading the provision (to minimum affordable standards) of piped water,
sewerage, stormwater drainage, solid waste management, road paving, and street
lighting in the Katchi Pumpwali community (45 ha) benefiting some 16,000
people. In addition, reclamation and drainage would be undertaken of a stag-
nant and putrified pond in Katchi Pumpwali (some 20 ha), yielding major
environmental improvements through removing insect breeding grounds and a
highly polluted and putrid pond, and giving badly-needed public open space.
Municipal accounting systems and water and sewerage billing systems would be
updated, including provision of modernized equipment (see para. 13).
11.      Pilot Upgrading Scheme in Sialkot-SMC/HPEPD (US$2.5 million).  Hous-
ing land with adequate services is not available, and in many densely popu-
lated parts of the city, large numbers of low income households live in very
poor conditions. The project would finance the provision through upgrading to
minimum standards of affordability of piped water, sewerage, stormwater drain-
age, solid waste management, road paving and street lighting at Fateh Garh
Road. The 115 ha site would serve about 25,000 people. Improvements would be
made to municipal accounting and water and sewerage billing systems, including
provision of modernized equipment (see para. 13).

12.      Pilot Walled City and Area Upgrading in Multan-MDA (US$0.5 million).
Services in the densely populated and historic Walled City of Multan (101 ha)
are inadequate, and the fabric of many commercial, domestic, and culturally
important structures is crumbling. In addition, many outlying housing areas
do not have basic services. A pilot program to be undertaken in close colla-
boration with the Multan Municipal Corporation (MMC) would provide improved
piped water, stormwater drainage, road paving, street lighting and solid waste
management, together with related off-site trunk infrastructure in 4.5 ha of
the Walled City (population of 5,500) and to 6 ha in the low income housing
area of Usman Pura (population of 2,000). To gain experience in city renewal,
a pilot program of renovation and conservation of selected buildings in the
Walled City would be undertaken. Improvements would be made to the municipal
accounting and water and sewerage billing systems of MMC and MDA, including
provision of modernized equipment (see para. 13).
13.      Project Management and Sector Training-HPEPD (US$4.2 million).
Effective project management, aimed at ensuring that project goals, are
expeditiously achieved in parallel with manpower skill building for sustain-
ability and replicability, is central to project success. Recognizing the
complex interrelationships between agencies involved in the urban sector, a
strong Project Management Unit (PMU), drawing staff from LGRD and HPEPD would
be formed. The Director General, PMU, would be supported by technical and
administrative directorates with support staff and support facilities and
equipment. The PMU would be supported for about four years by an advisory
consultants group (60 local and 96 international man months) providing
specialist expertise in: (a) project management and municipal finance; and
(b) engineering design and construction management. The PMU would manage and
execute 28 man-years of project-related training in municipal finance and
financial management; engineering design methods; site supervision procedures;
and project preparation, appraisal and management.   The thrust of training
would be through on-the-job skills building, with working level study tours to
broaden experience. The PMU would execute, with the help of consultants, the
detailed design and supervision of pilot projects in Gujranwala and Sialkot,
and improvements to municipal accounting and water and sewerage billing sys-
tems in the three intermediate cities.
14.      Property Tax Streamlining (E & T) (US$0.5 million).  Improvements to
local resource mobilization in Lahore and the other project cities would be
achieved in part through enhancements to the property tax system, which pro-
vides essential municipal revenues. The project would finance studies,
technical assistance and consultancy services, and equipment and facilities
modernization to upgrade property taxation records, and streamline collection
procedures and accounting for receivables. Anomalies in the existing regula-
tory framework will be identified, and improved management information systems
designed and implemented, including the use of microcomputers. Pilot programs
of improvement would be started in Lahore and in two taxation districts.
These studies would be assisted by consultants (six local and six interna-
tional man-months). Logistical support facilities to enhance tax collection
would comprise specialized vehicles and equipment for collection and enforce-
ment, office equipment including microcomputers, training equipment and office

Page 6 of 7
refurbishment. Training for middle management and supervisors would be both
on-the-job and through study tours on valuation, tax assessment, collection
and administration procedures.
15.      Institutional Strengthening of LDA (US$1.8 million).  Strengthening
LDA would be provided through tailored technical assistance to the Traffic
Engineering and Planning Agency (TEPA), the Upgrading and Conservation Unit
(UCU) and to senior management. The newly-formed TEPA would require 144 local
and 57 international man-months technical assistance in traffic management and
planning, signals engineering, urban transport policy planning, and investment
programming. Local consultant support would also assist in engineering design
and document preparation, in which TEPA skills are limited. The UCU would
require 64 local and 40 international man-months training and developing
upgrading and conservation program management skills. To improve LDA pricing
and cost recovery strategies, investment planning, and capital budgeting, and
to enhance the efficiency of project implementation, 48 local and 24 interna-
tional man-months of technical assistance would be required. This work would
build on the double entry bookkeeping system currently being implemented. The
technical assistance inputs would include on-the-job training for both higher
and operational level staff, and support equipment.
16.      Support to Puniab Road Transport Corporation - PRTC
(US$0.5 million). Technical assistance would comprise 12 local and 48
international man-months to upgrade skills in system operation and main-
tenance, together with strategic investment programming and financial
management. Public transport strategies would be evaluated and the optimal
role for the public sector identified.
17.      LMC Finance and Maintenance Operational Strengthening - LMC
(US$0.5 million). To effectively implement the road rehabilitation program,
24 man-months of a works engineer would provide training and skills transfer
on roads equipment maintenance, program design and project preparation, and
cost control. To enhance fitiancial and budgeting capacity and strengthen cost
control and planning, 48 local and 12 international man-months would be pro-
vided.  The accounting system and support equipment would be modernized and
extensive on-the-job training undertaken.
18.      Base !.tapping - HPEPD and LDA (US$4.0 million).  Project preparation
has shown the base mapping in Lahore and the intermediate cities to be inade-
quate for investment program design and preliminary engineering. To provide a
solid basis for planning and development (see also para. 2.29), base mapping
of Lahore and the eight Punjab intermediate cities would be undertaken.
19.      Multan Development Study and Investment Preparation - MDA
(US$0.9 million). Development in Multan has taken place in the framework of
an outdated master plan, poor mapping and limited data. Consultancy services
(estimated 120 local and 60 international man-months) would: (a) revise the
existing master plan; prepare action-oriented medium-term structure plans;
(b) undertake feasibility studies and preliminary engineering of priority
investment projects for city-wide infrastructure, area upgrading, conservation

of historic assets, area development, and transportation; (c) undertake
detailed engineering design and documentation of selected investment projects;
(d) evaluate the financial and administrative systems of MMC and prepare an
improvement action program (see para. 13); and (d) assist MDA monitor and
evaluate pilot Walled City and area upgrading schemes.
20.      Puniab Urban Strategy and Investment Planning - HPEPD/PMU
(US$1.6 million). Urban investments anticipated over the next decade will
require a logical framework within which to meet strategic goals. This
component would provide consultancy services (estimated 216 local and 108
foreign man-months) which would: update master plans for Gujranwala, Sialkot,
Sargodha, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Sheikhupura and Rahim Yar Khan; for each city
prepare action-oriented phased medium-term investment plans; and complete
feasibility studies, inclusive of preliminary engineering, of priority invest-
ment projects for city-wide infrastructure, area upgrading, area development,
transportation, solid waste collection and other urban services; and assist
the monitoring and evaluation of pilot schemes in Gujranwala, Sialkot, and
Multan. A study of Metropolitan Management and Finance in Punjab undertaken
in parallel would consider strategies for (a) integrating investment planning,
physical planning and budgeting; (b) increasing local level agency resource
mobilization to enable expanded urban services to be self-sustaining; and
(c) improving agency coordination. The study would evaluate financial, admini-
strative and management options, and prepare an action program of improvements.
21.      Future Project Preparation - HPEDP/LDA (US$3.1 million).  To meet the
projected growth for services and consequent investment programs, the project
would provide for detailed engineering and preparation of the next tranche of
urban investments identified for the early 1990s. PMU would be responsible
for preparation and appraisal, acting as a project intermediary. LDA would be
the lead agency for Lahore investments.
22.      Training (costs provided for under each technical assistance and
consultancy assignment). Cost-effective human resource development is one of
the project objectives. Training has been designed integrally with each com-
ponent, and would be achieved through: (a) on-the-job training; (b) technical
advisors placed in agencies in line positions on a fade-out basis; (c) consul-
tants working within agencies; and (d) topic-oriented study tours and training
programs for line staff.  The PMU would coordinate and monitor performance.
Consultants terms of reference would incorporate responsibilities for training
and skill transfer to agency staff.

PUNJAB URBAN DEVELOPMET PROJECT
JuwlmDentln Agnies
A. Project Manapemet Unit (PFU)
1.       The PMU (para. 3.01) will play the lead role in the project in ensur-
Lug (a) inter-agency coordination is achieved; (b) all requisite approvals are
obtained at the planning and design stage; (c) quality control and consistency
is *aintained during execution; and (d) an orderly transfer made of assets,
and maintenance responsibility assumed.
B. Lahe Deelvemet AutbOdty (LA)
2.       The LDA is a statutory authority created under the LDA ACT of 1975 to
replace the Lahore Improvement Trust. Board membership includes the Chief
Minister of the Punjab (Chairman), the Director General (chief executive
officer), the Ministers of Local Government and Rural Development (LGRD), and
Rousing Physical and Environmental Planning (HPEPD), the Chief Secretary
GoPunjab, the Chairmen of the Planning and Development Board, four GoPunjab
Departmental secretaries, the Mayor of Lahore, the managing director of WASA,
the chairmen of Lahore Municipal Committees and 2 members of the Provincial
Assembly. LDA has the authority to create agencies such as the Water and
Sanitation Agency (WASA) which is autonomous but under the IDA Board
(para. 9). LWA will implement the components of area upgrading in N.E. Lahore
and in the Walled City, the conservation activities in the Walled City, and
the *raffic engineering and transport component through the recently formed
T-A';ic Engineering and Planning Agency (TEPA).  It will receive technical
. Jstance to strengthen TEPA, (para. 5) and the Upgrading and Conservation
t. (para. 6), and its development scheme financial management and pricing
yolicy (para. 8).
Functions and Organization
3.       LDA is broadly charged with development planning and implementation,
land development and provision of housing in the Lahore metropolitan area. It
is responsible for the formulation and administration of building regulations,
maintenance of the famous parks and gardens of Lahore, and indirectly through
WAS for water supply, drainage and. sewerage (para. 9). The Act gives LDA
virtually unrestricted development powers within the Lahore metropolitan area,
including exclusive rights to the extraction of groundwater within the area;
tubewells installation requires the permission of LDA. WXA comprises nine
directorates (metropolitan planning, administration, finance, land develop-
ment, engineering, estate management, katchi abadis, coordination and imple-
mentation, and horticulture) and 2 agencies WASA and TEPA. Excluding WASA,
there are currently some 250 professional and 1,700 nonprofessional staff, and
a large casual staff (principally in the horticultural directorate).
4.       Since its formation, LDA has played an aggressive and leading
development role in Lahore, undertaking extensive housing, area development,



- 44 -
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 15
and traffic engineering and road schemes. It has a major role in the ongoing
Lahore Urban Project (Credit 1348-PAK) through implementing the Gujjapurra
sites and services scheme and Phase I of the Walled City upgrading, and has
led GoPunjab's preparation of PUDP.
5.       Traffic Engineering and Planning Agency (TEPA).  TEPA was created in
mid-1987 with responsibilities for traffic engineering in metropolitan Lahore,
and sole authority to procure, install, operate and maintain traffic control
devices. Staff comprises those in the previous LDA Traffic Directorate, which
was active in planning and implementing traffic engineering schemes. TEPA
will execute the traffic component of PUDP, and undertake planning, design and
bid document preparation for traffic management schemes; procurement and con-
struction supervision of civil works will be undertaken by the LDA Engineering
Directorate which has both the capacity and requisite experience. Site super-
vision will be done by consultants. Existing TEPA staffing (10 professional
and 14 nonprofessional) is not adequate for the expanded workload; additional
senior professional staff will be recruited and technical assistance, train-
ing, and equipment provided to TEPA through PUDP to strengthen capacity during
the agency's early years. TEPA will liaise closely with road safety authori-
ties, to ensure that allocations are made to Lahore from the recently approved
IDA-financed Fourth Highway Project (Loan 2814-PAK).
6.       Upgrading and Conservation Unit (UCU).  Planning, design and execu-
tion of area upgrading is the responsibility of the Directorate of Metropolitan
Planning (DMP) under the Chief Metropolitan Planner. To handle the expanded
workload of PUDP, and in particular the specialized pilot conservation activi-
ties proposed, LDA has created an Upgrading and Conservation Unit which will
implement the components of Walled City upgrading and conservation, and the
North East Lahore upgrading. The Unit will comprise some 30 professional
staff mainly from LDA, who will specialize in this field, drawing on the
experience of Phase I of Walled City upgrading and the galli upgrading pilot
project undertaken during project preparation. The planning, research work,
and site supervision of the on-going Gujjapura scheme will continue under the
Chief Metropolitan Planner: area development schemes will continue under the
Engineering Directorate. LDA does have limited experience in area upgrading,
but no experience in conservation; technical assistance will be provided
through PUDP to strengthen the Unit and put in place the skills for sustained
long-term programs. A high-level Conservation Steering Committee has been
formed by GoPunjab, to provide an overview of Walled City Conservation.
Finance
7.       LDA is implementing a double entry system of accounting using con-
sultants financed under Credit 1348-PAK. As this work is advanced but not
complete, analysis of their financial position is based on notional current
and capital accounts (see Annex 7). Main sources of current account income
are fees, departmental charges and interest; expenditures on current account
are for salaries, debt service and operating costs. Current expenditures
generally exceed current income by about 30%. On capital account, sources of
funds are mainly from sale of land, development charges, grants (ADP and
provincial and national assembly member funds) and loans. Capital flows tend



- 45 -
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 15
by nature to be lumpy and irregular; however the capital account has shown a
cumulative surplus over the last two years, and a surplus is projected for
FY87. The system of accounting does not provide information for adequate
planning, budgeting or project management and cost control.
8.       LDA has been profitable to date, though not necessarily economically
efficient. Of concern is that up to now development land has been acquired at
well below market price (under the 1973 Land Act, now super^eded) and on
deferred payment terms. LDA could thus sell developed plots on a "no
profit/no loss" basis, cover costs and still be competitive with the private
sector who could not acquire land below market value. The legal framework for
land development is now the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, subsequent legisla-
tion having been recently repealed. Under this Act, to commence acquisition
proceedings, the full cost of land to be acquired (based on the average price
of similar land during the previous year) must be deposited. An analysis of
their current development plans shows that profitability is highly sensitive
to small changes in sales price or development costs. LDA financial projec-
tions and sensitivity analysis are shown in Annex 7. This stresses the need
for: (a) improved market analysis and pricing policies; and (b) more rigorous
program planning, budgeting, financial and project management than before.
The LDA Finance Directorate will implement this through the project, with the
help of technical assistance. IDA will also be responsible for indirect cost
recovery for non-revenue earning LDA assets created through PUDP. Recovery
will be from charges made on area development schemes.  This will require LDA
to adopt a land pricing policy that will (a) create and maintain an overall
surplus on combined current and capital accounts and (b) include provision for
financing non-revenue generating investments.
C. Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA)
9.       WASA was set up as an autonomous agency under the LDA (Amendment) Act
1976, as a self-accounting entity empowered to operate and maintain water
supply, sewerage and drainage systems within Lahore and to charge for ser-
vices. WASA has the same board as IDA; the managing director serves as chief
executive officer. The Board meets formally at least annually. Day to day
operations of WASA are governed by Appointment and Conditions of Service
Regulations 1978, and the Delegation of Powers regulations issued by LDA.
WASA will execute the water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment, and
stormwater drainage and disposal components of PUDP.
Organization and Functions
10.      Under the managing director are two deputy managing directors, one
for operations and maintenance, and one for engineering, and directorates of
administration, financing, revenue and evaluation. The operations and
maintenance activities comprise two geographically based operations director-
ates, and a maintenance directorate. Engineering activities comprise two
construction directorates, a planning and design directorate and a stores and
procurement directorate. Professional level staff totals about 500 (165 in
administration and finance), and nonprofessional 3850 (520 in administration
and finance). A directorate has been formed and staffed for implementation of
PUDP.

11.      WASA responsibilities for providing and maintaining services to
Lahore are extensive. The city has for historic reasons a partially combined
sewerage system; WASA has responsibility for stormwater drainage management,
which is complex given the geographical configuration of Lahore being low
lying and flat, surrounded by a flood protection bund. WASA thus has to
liaise, plan and manage in close coordination with all city agencies to avoid
damage to services and ensure adequate operations. If solid waste is impro-
perly disposed of by a householder or LMC it generally ends up in the storm
drainage or sewer system; if roads are constructed without adequate drainage,
the sewer system gets overloaded. WASA ability and authority to deal with
these problems logically is essential to the economic functioning of the city.
Finance
12.      WASA receives revenue for water sales, sewerage charges, 42.52 of the
annual property tax receipts (to contribute to sewage, sullage and stormwater
services) and interest. Revenues for FY87 will be about Rs 185 million
(though they should be considerably higher-see subsequently) and capital works
of some Rs 130 million will be completed. Assets in operation at end FY87
were estimated to be valued at some Rs 2.0 billion - WASA is one of the
largest revenue-earning institutions in Lahore. WASA has 195 tubewells
supplying the city entirely from groundwater, with an original installed
capacity of about 290 million gallons per day (mgd), pumping about 220 mgd
(FY87) to serve about 2.5 million people, including 5 mgd for commercial,
industrial and horticultural use.  Gross average demand is estimated to be 81
gallons per capita per day including losses of about 402.  Water is delivered
and billed to the following connections:
1986/87 Average   -
No. of         Net Demand
Connections        (mgd)
Domestic:  Metered                            34,900             25
Unmetered                         215,700           109
Commercial/Industrial:  Metered                9,800            <13
Unmetered             1,300            <incl above
Religious and Charitable: Unmetered            1,900              2
LMC/LDA, incl. public standposts               1,900              9
Total Water Connections           265,500            158 mgd net
(220 mgd gross)
Unmetered properties are charged on the basis of annual rental value (ARV) of
the property, which is the basis for property tax (para. 49) in six bands of
increasing value. Larger domestic properties (ARV greater than Rs 721) and,
in theory, all commercial and industrial premises are metered, with a minimum
quarterly charge. Meter rental and connection fees are also charged. WASA
manages and maintains an extensive network of sewers, sullage/stormwater
drains and pump stations. Given the mixed nature of the sewer and storm drain-
age system, it is estimated that over 902 of the population is connected to a
WASA sewer or sullage collector/stormdrain system. There is no data available



- 47 -
ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 15
on the number of sewer connections. There are however some 550 bulk sever
connections. There are over 200 private tubewells in Lahore; wastewater flows
from these consumers are disposed of by WASA at no charge (this will be recti-
fied under the amended tariff (see para. 4.03). Details of water demand and
supply are shown in Anaex 8.
13.     WASA's tariff structure was set up in 1977, based on consultants
recommendations of 1975. There have been four increases since 1977, (in
October 1980, July 1981, July 1983 and July 1984). The 1984 increase varied
been 1.5 and 2.5S. The increases have been unbalanced and tariffs for metered
connections use are still below those recommended in 1977; the bulk of charg-
ing is still done on the basis of 1977 ARV values due to a GoPunjab ruling.
WASA has made numerous applications to GoPunjab to raise tariffs but has not
been permitted to do so; this has resulted in WASA being in a very poor finan-
cial position. The ROR covenant in Credit 630-PAK was renegotiated from an
original 61 on revalued fixed assets to a reduced target of 2.11 in FY83 (1.1l
was achieved) rising to 3.51 by FY86 (1.51 was achieved). A negative ROR and
cashflow are projected for FY87, making no contribution to capital require-
ments. WASA is also responsible under Credit 630-PAK's Credit Agreement for
foreign exchange risk on outstanding loans. As currently structured WASA is
not financially viable as an autonomous entity, nor is there a basis on which
economic efficiency or social equity of service delivery can be achieved;
further investments to meet Lahore's economic growth, or even maintain exist-
ing assets are not possible without financial restructuing.  WASA has no
equity (or service free capital base) and is funded principally by GoPunjab
long-term loans.
*  14.   Under direction of GoPunjab, WASA has undertaken a major review of
its financial position, and with the help of consultants (financed through
Credit 1348-PAK), proposed an amended tariff and financial restructuring
package aimed at restoring their financial viability. Details are shown in
para. 4.03. In addition, WASA will embark on a major program to improve
operational and management efficiency, which will be required to meet both
production and financial targets. Existing Delegation of Powers require
updating to reflect current organization responsibility and service obliga-
tions. GoPunjab will also, through the project, further explore how to
improve WASA's authorities required for day-to-day operations. Agreement was
obtained at negotiations that: (a) an adequate, equitable and sustainable
tariff and financial restructuring package to achieve financial viability will
be implemented (see para. 4.03); (b) GoPunjab, will prepare and before
end-FY89 implement a program to ensure WASA has all proper authorities to
carry out day-to-day operations. The historic and projected financial
position of WASA is shown in Annex 8 which shows that the proposed tariff
package would restore WASA to financial viability. WASA accounts are not
consolidated with the LDA accounts.
15.      WASA will be responsible for a major investment program financed
through PUDP, while maintaining public service, and regularly increasing
tariffs. Investments will focus on revenue gain, rehabilitation and infilling
to improve operational efficiency and services; without the latter, tariff
increases will not be easy to sustain against public pressure. The project



- 48 -
ANNEX 4
Page 6 of 15
will, therefore, include technical assistance and organizational strengthen-
ing, in addition to physical investments in tubewells and tubewell rehabilita-
tion, water supply and sewer reticulation and rehabilitation, sewage treatment
and stormwate: drainage.  The technical assistance will focus on the core
activities of (a) management and finance; (b) operations and maintenance; and
(c) engineering design and construction through training and support to the
WASA engineering directorate. The financial system will be improved, includ-
ing computerization of billing and collection systems, and updating of
management information systems. The proposed investment (US$77.1 million) is
considerable; however, combined with the tariff and management/technical
assistance package, it is within the capacity of WASA, will improve service
coverage in Lahore, and restore WASA to financial viability.
D. Lahore Metropolitan Corporation (LMC)
16.      The LMC is an autonomous body operating under the Punjab Local
Government Act 1975, and the 1979 Punjab Local Government Ordinance. It is
directed by an elected mayor and council under the Secretariat of Local
Government and Rural Development (LGRD).  Elections were last held in 1983 to
elect the mayor and a house of 115 councillors, and the next elections are
scheduled late 1987.  LMC will execute the road rehabilitation and tertiary
storm drainage component of PUDP.
Functions and Organizations
17.      LMC is responsible for providing a wide range of services within the
municipal area including: (a) maintenance, repair, and construction of roads
and streets; (b) control of encroachments; (c) fire fighting; (d) provision
and maintenance of street lights and road signs; (e) primary education;
(f) maintenance of tertiary open drains; (g) health and sanitation, including
solid waste collection and disposal; and (h) recreation (parks) and social
welfare.
18.      Many of these services are provided by the LMC; however, LMC also
contracts other agencies to provide some services including WAPDA (street
light maintenance) and LDA-TEPA (traffic signal maintenance and road con-
struction). WASA has responsibility for provision of primary drainage which
is done in liaison with LMC.
19.      LMC has some 12,750 employees, of which 7,000 are in the sanitation
department, 750 in Octroi, and the remaining 5,000 providing the other ser-
vices; FY87 current income was budgeted at Rs 429 million. The corporation is
organized into seven departments under the Chief Corporation Officer, who
handles administration and secretariat, namely (a) engineering (firefighting,
street lighting, roads, construction works, building control, parks, solid
waste collection); (b) education (administration of LMC schools and other
educational matters); (c) veterinary (operation and maintenance of slaughter
houses); (d) medical (public health measures, administration of medical esta-
blishments; (e) social Welfare and Public Relations (administration of the
welfare establishments and publications); (f) accounts (budget and finance);



- 49 -
ANNEX 4
Page 7 of 15
and (g) taxation (all revenues). Solid waste collection and disposal has
receutly been transferred to the engineers' department from medical to
streamline management.
20.      Road maintenance capability is limited and many secondary roads and
streets with their related sidewalks and drainage structures are in a badly
deteriorated state. This gives rise to widespread damage to goods and
vehicles, particularly in the rainy season when commercial activities are
badly disrupted. The project will provide equipment for road rehabilitation
and maintenance, and technical assistance and training in maintenance
management.
Finance
21.      LMC operates on a cash-based accounting system.  The annually pre-
pared budget is the principal instrument of financial planning and expenditure
control. Internal audit is performed by a provincial Local Fund Audit Depart-
ment. While the system is effective in controlling expenditures it do-:s not
provide an adequate basis for financial policy making and reporting; LMC
wishes to improve the system but lacks the staff to do so. Funds are there-
fore provided under the project to employ consultants to assist LMC upgrade
its financial systems.
22.      In 1986/87, LMC budgeted current income of Rs 427 million was from
Octroi (632), property tax (132), transfer tax on property (82), rents and
interest (52) and other municipal sources such as markets and taxi registra-
tion charges (111). It in addition was budgeted to receive Rs 38 million from
capital grants (mainly for the MNA/MPA program). These figures are consistent
with the earlier year trends.  Lahore property tax income is shared between
WASA (42.5X), LMC (42.5X) and the Department of Excise and Taxation 152 (to
cover collection charges).  Octroi is the main source of LMC income, and while
there has been some growth in recent years, LMC octroi rates have not been
increased since 1975 and per capita collections are at FY83 levels in real
terms.  Octroi is collected by contractors appointed annually by auction,
which may account for the poor performance.
23.      Salaries and staff costs represented about 75% of recurrent costs in
FY87. Total current expenditure amounted to Rs 288 m, and the surplus of
current income over current expenditure (Rs 139 m) together with Rs 6 m from
reserves made up the contribution to capital expenditure of Rs 145 m. Total
FY87 capital expenditure amounted to Rs 183 m, with major components of
expenditure on roads (Rs 65 m), sanitation (Rs 30 m) and drainage (Rs 25 m).
24.      The forecast for the immediate future is that, unless revenues are
increased, the level of LMC's investment will need to be curtailed. Even if
octroi rates are raised by 251, only the Project expenditure prevents per
capita investment in 1988/89 falling back to the levels of the early 1980s.
(At this level LMC would be spending less on development per head than any of
the three intermediate cities in the Project expect to spend in 1987/88).
Without increases in revenues, investments may fall by a further 50% below
these levels. The projected financial position of IMC is shown in Annex 9.



- 50 -
ANNEX 4
Page 8 of 15
Based upon the 1985/86 real per capital investment levels in major services,
the forecast illustrates the shortfall in investment funds that occurs betv'en
FY89 and FY92 (assuming PUDP to be additional).
25.      Nevertheless, LMC's modest participation in the project of Rs 70 m
over a three-year period is considered affordable. The capital expenditure
components of the project amount to Rs 58 m spread over FY89 and FY90, less
than 5S of LMC's projected income and 161 of projected capital expenditure
during this period. The technical assistance is funded as a grant to LC and
is not a financial burden. Presently LMC has no outstanding long term loan
liability, and the maximum debt service commitment of PUDP is forecast to be
only 2S of LMC's operating surplus.
E. Puniab Road Transport Corporation (PRTC)
26.      The PRTC was formed in May 1985 by the merger of the Punjab Urban
Transportation Corporation (PUTC) and the Punjab Road Transport Board (PRTB).
The corporation operates under the Companies Ordnance of 1984, is owned
two-thirds by the Federal Government and one-third by GoPunjab, and directed
by a Board and managing director who is chief executive officer.  PTRC will
implement a technical assistance component aimed at strengthening financial
p1anning, and operations and maintenance.
Functions and Operation
27.      PRTC is responsible for providing urban and intercity bus services in
the Punjab. However, the statutory role and objectives outlined in its
Articles of Association are vague as is government policy on urban transport.
This has hampered PRTC.  There are five departmental directors responsible for
finance, technical, operations, procurement and stores, and personnel and
administration. PRTC has had six different managing directors over the past
six years, these changes causing disruption and a lack of continuity. The
urban wing provides in-city transport services in Lahore, Rawalpindi/Islama-
bad, Faisalabad and Multan. The intercity operation provides service between
the main centers. In spite of an extensive network of depots and maintenance
facilities, generally less than 50% of the 1,730 bus fleet is generally opera-
tional at any time, due to age and poor maintenance of the vehicle fleet. In
1986, the operation provided the following services:
Urban         Intercitr        Total
Passengers         - no.                  77.4 m          19.1 m         96.5 m
Students           -  no.                39.4 m            2.2 m         41.6 m
Total ridership    -  no.               116.8 m           21.3 m        138.1 m
Miles travelled    -  km.                 35.3 m          31.4 m         66.7 m
28.      In Lahore, PRTC carries about 452 of bus passenger traffic and a
similar proportion in the other cities; however, the intercity operation
services less than 52 of the traffic. PRTC provides subsidized travel to
students which is a major loss of revenue, and difficult to control.



- 51 -
ANNEX 4
Page 9 of 15
29.      Staff totals about 13,000, of which 4,750 are in urban operations in
Lahore. While overall manning levels are excessively high, transport manage-
ment, planning and financial skills are very limited and morale is low. The
trade unions are very influential in PRTC, and are seen as a continuing
bottleneck to improve productivity and efficiency. Current manning ratio of
1:13 needs to be substantially reduced. The Government of Sweden has sup-
ported a technical assistance program in PRTC during the past 5 years.
Finance
30.      Ninety-eight percent of revenue is from passenger income; expenditure
is principally on vehicle operating expenses (58X) and payroll costs (372).
Revenues have hardly grown since 1983, due to (a) Government reluctance to
increase fares; and (b) serious revenue leakage, (estimated to be 36% in FY87,
reduced from over 502 in FY86). On FY86 revenue of Rs 300 million, PRTC made
a loss of Rs 192 million before and Rs 290 million after financial charges and
depreciation. Cumulative deficits will exceed Rs 2 billion by the end of
FY87. This poor financial position has persisted for a number of years,
accounting for shortage of funds for operations and in particular spare parts
and equipment required to maintain the fleet. The deficits have been made up
by allocations from the Provincial Government. PRTC has substantial long term
indebtedness (mainly to GoPunjab) and is in excess of Rs 1 billion behind in
debt service. Though merged, financial information is still maintained
separately for the urban and intercity operations.
31.      PRTC meets an important need in urban transport; however, a clear
policy defining the respective responsibilities of public and private sector
is needed before any major investment should be considered by IDA. Despite
the poor financial position and undefined status of urban public transport
policy, since PRTC meets transport needs in particular of the lower income
groups, the project will finance a small technical assistance component,
focussing on (a) improving financial planning and developing a corporate
strategy including a Public Transport Strategy study and a strategic invest-
ment program for PRTC; and (b) operations and maintenance improvements.
F. HousinL Physdel and Environmental Planning Deuerment
32.      The Housing, Physical and Environmental Planning Department (HPEPD),
created by the consolidation of the Housing and Physical Planning Department
(HP&P) and the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), is one of the
major technically based agencies of GoPunjab. The Department falls under the
Minister of HPEPD and is headed by a Secretary, to whom a Director General and
a Chief Engineer report.
Functions and Organization
33.      The principal functions and responsibilities of HPEPD are (a) prepara-
tion of regional master plans and outline development plans in areas where
there are no Development Authorities; (b) preparation and implementation of
area development schemes; (c) planning, preparation and implementation of
urban and rural water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes; (d) formulation
and implementation of environmental pollution prevention and control policies;



ANNEX 4
Page 10 of 15
and (e) administrative control of development authorities and improvement
trusts. Development authorities in Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad are thus
under HPEPD. Staff comprises about 300 senior professional and 3,000 junior
and non-professional staff (excluding the authorities).
34.      HP&P based in Lahore, has responsibility for the provision of low
income housing, and physical planning, and has over the past 15 years
developed over 100,000 plots, and undertaken extensive urban and regional
physical planning studies. HP&P is responsible for allotment of plots
developed through its schemes on a "no profit no loss" basis, according to
agreed criteria. The impact of the repeal of the 1973 Land Act on HP&P
operations has yet to be established, but will probably make land development
more difficult (see para. 8).
35.      PHED implements the planning, design and construction of urban and
rural water, sewerage and drainage services (except those schemes falling
under development authorities), together with water quality and environmental
pollution control, and industrial waste treatment and disposal. Executive
engineers are posted in most districts of the Punjab. Schemes are handed over
to local bodies on completion, though in practice this has proved difficult in
many cases, where local bodies have refused to take over schemes or lacked the
capacity to operate and maintain services although PHED provides technical
advice and overview of operations and maintenance. In FY86, PHED completed 43
urban schemes serving 0.5 million people, and 137 rural schemes serving 0.3
million people. Service standards and consequently costs are high, limiting
the impact and coverage of investment programs.
36.      The Project Management Unit (PMU) (see para. 3.01) will be located in
HPEPD; it will be able to draw on the manpower and influence the practices of
HPEPD, contributing experience gained through the project. The formulation of
an urban sector investment program for the intermediate cities, and prepara-
tion of base mapping through the project will further strengthen HPEPD. The
preparation of future investment programs will be undertaken more effectively
than in the past, being able to draw on a broad experience base, blending
planning, engineering and financial skills. The central environmental pro-
tection role of HPEPD would ensure that GOP policy would be consistently
promoted through the project. Environmental protection activities are still
limited and the project would indirectly strengthen HPEPD in this area.
37.      Training in current approaches to manpower development and low cost
provision of infrastructure has been limited in HPEPD; this was highlighted
during project preparation. The two departments (HP&P and PHED) tend to work
independently. The project will assist in reducing the different approaches
to development between the planners and engineers; project focus on these
items will enhance sector capacity.
Finance
38.      HPEPD is responsible for the largest component of the GoPunjab Annual
Development Program (ADP) expenditure budget (Rs 1,580 million or 23% of total
ADP in FY87). The importance of prudent program design, selection of cost
effective standards and sound budgetary control and project management in all



- 53 -
ANNEX 4
Page 11 of 15
the many complex operations are one of HPEPD priorities. The technical, mana-
gerial and financial intervention proposed through the project coordinated by
the PMU will help meet these priorities.
G. Mult8n Develooment Authority (MDA)
39.      The MDA is an autonomous agency under HPEPD, governed by the Punjab
Development of Cities Act 1976; when established in October 1976, it absorbed
the assets, schemes and liabilities of the Multan Improvement Trust, and staff
and schemes of the Multan Public Health Engineering circle. Chief executive
is the Director General and Board Chairman is the Chief Minister of the
Punjab; Board membership is also drawn from the Multan Municipal Corporation
and the Provincial Assembly and GoPunjab departments. The MDA will execute
components comprising pilot upgrading and conservation in 4.5 ha of the Walled
City, pilot upgrading of some 6 ha of katchi abadi, together with planning and
investment preparation studies for Multan, and improvements to the financial
accounting system.
Functions and Organization
40.      MDA has responsibility for development planning and implementation
including area development (housing and commercial) katchi abadi and slum
improvement, building control, road development, water supply and sewage
disposal within the Multan Metropolitan Area which covers some 362 sq. km.
MDA has a staff of 750 in four main directorates: finance and administration,
engineering, estate management and town planning. The active Planning
Directorate has executed a number of roads, water and sewerage, and housing
schemes over the past five years. It operates and maintains the Multan water
supply and sewerage system on an informal agency basis on behalf of the Multan
Municipal Corporation. MDA has requested GoPunjab to create a separate Water
Supply and Sanitation Agency under MDA; currently, GoPunjab do not intend to
implement this to avoid proliferation of organizations. The Planning Direc-
torate was responsible for preparing the project component, and will play the
ieaa roie in execution.  ionsuitants wiii  ue eubactv Lu  ltdezt"'  tb.e  la=3 
and investment preparation studies, and for assisting in preparing final
designs and bid documents for the upgrading activities.
Finance
41.      For FY87, MDA budgeted expenditure of Rs 13 million on revenue
account (80% from departmental charges) and forecast an operating deficit of
Rs 1.50 million. Expenditures are mainly on staff costs and overheads. FY87
development expenditure for the year is projected at Rs 189 million, princi-
pally on housing schemes and infrastructure projects; these are largely
balanced by development receipts from GoPunjab, special grants and deposit
works (projected at Rs 166 million in FY87). Annex 10 shows a more detailed
financial overview of MDA, together with financial projections. MDA currently
has a Rs 24 million debt to GoPunjab, and is owed some Rs 9 million by the
Multan Municipal Corporation for water and sewerage operations. Finances will
be strained during the next three years until revenue from the main ongoing
development project (Shah Gardez Town) builds up; a development account sur-
plus is projected by FY91. The relatively small capital investment (Rs 12.5
million) through PUDP over a three-year period represents only 3% of the

Page 12 of 15
1986/87 development receipts and is considered to be within the financial
capacity of MDA to service.
H. Coixorations of Guirn=Wla.8 Sialot and Multau
42.      The municipal corporations fall under the Ministry of Local Govern-
ment and Rural Development (LGRD), and operate under the Punjab Local
Government Ordinance (1979).  Corporations are generally constituted for
cities defined as urban areas with a population greater than 500,000. The
Municipal Corporations of Gujranwala (GMC), Sialkot (SMC) and Multan (MMC) are
directed by elected houses of mayors and councilors; an appointed chief cor-
poration officer is the principal administrative officer. The corporations of
Gujranwala and Sialkot will, through HPEPD, implement and take over maintenance
of pilot area upgrading schemes, and improvements to financial accounting
systems. Multan will take over the maintenance of pilot schemes implemented
by MDA, and implement improvments to their financial accounting system.
Functions and Organization
43.      The corporations are responsible for most aspects of city management,
administration, service provision and development including primary educa-
tion. However, responsibility for planning and implementing city growth and
infrastructure including water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage in
Sialkot and Gujranwala lies with provincial-level authorities (Public Health
Engineering Department, under HPEPD). In the case of Multan, the MDA has
development responsibility, (see para. 40). Katchi abadi and slum improvement
is a municipal responsibility though GoPunjab has recently created a depart-
ment to tackle this problem from a provincial level. Sui Gas (where available)
and WAPDA provide and maintain their respective services.  Operations and
maintenance is a municipal responsibility; technical advice and support is
provided to GMC and SMC by PHED for water supply, sewerage and stormwater
drainage maintenance. Streetlighting is maintained by WAPDA on an agency
basis. MDA undertakes water and sewerage maintenance work in Multan on behalf
of MMC. The corporations are responsible for planning, constructing and main-
taining city roads and streets; major road infrastructure is a provincial or
national level responsibility. Solid waste collection and disposal system in
the three towns are important city-level responsibilities which require
upgrading (which will be done a pilot basis through the project).

45.      Through the project, the corporations will strengthen the technical
and operational manpower in their engineering departments. These strengthened
departments will initially undertake implementation of the pilot programs in
collaboration with HPEPD (Public Health Engineering Department) and then move
on to improve operat:ons and maintenance.  GMC and SMC have expressed interest
to GoPunjab in forming development authorities; current GoPunjab thinking is
that further fragmentation of development responsibility should be avoided in
the Punjab cities.
Finance
46.      The corporations receive revenue from octroi, property tax, property
transfer tax, property rentals, water and sewerage charges and other municipal
fees and taxes. Receipts from each source based on the estimated FY87
out-turn are shown below:
Guiranwala        Sialkot        Multan

Octroi and property taxes are major sources of revenue. The corporation bud-
geting process aims to balance revenues and total expenditures assuming an
underlying revenue trend. The corporations are not equipped to undertake plan-
ning and budgeting based on city wide service and management requirements, but
recognize the need to do so. While octroi rates (which are under the control
of the corporations) have been increased over the past few years (Sialkot has
made regular increase; Gujranwala sporadic increase but in Multan increases
have been small), revenues have not kept pace with city requirements, causing
a deterioration in services as the cities have grown rapidly. Water and sewer
charges have been haphazardly applied, bearing little relation to cost or
service level. The financial position of Gujranwala and Sialkot is satisfac-
tory, particularly given the potential for continuing octroi growth, property

tax enhancements and the levying of meaningful water and sever charges.
Gujranwala has a loan outstanding of Rs 10.5 million; Sialkot has no major
loans outstanding. Gujranwala and Sialkot have adequate financial capacity to
service the proposed pilot investments, and to subsequently maintain the
schemes.
47.      Multan appears to be in better financial position than the other two
cities. However, the MMC outstanding debts to MDA need settling, and service
deficits and a backlog of city maintenance need to be caught up over the next
five years, to meet economic growth needs. Accounts are maintained on a
single-entry cash basis; management information to assist the council and
administration is not readily available. Investment decisions are conse-
quently taken largely on grounds of political or social expediency. Annex 11
shows a financial overview of the three cities, together with financial
statements.
48.      The pilot projects to be financed through PUDP will upgrade currently
unserviced communities, strengthen primary water sewerage and stormwater
drainage infrastructure, and give the corporations current experience in these
areas. In parallel, long-term investment strategies will be prepared, and
improvements made to corporation financial management systems, including
implementation of user charges for water supply and sewerage.
L Excise and Taxation Department (E & T)
49.      The Excise and Taxation Department (E & T) in the Government of
Punjab is responsible for collection of excise duty and property taxes, and
for drug control and enforcement. Property tax, governed under the Punjab
Immovable Property Tax Act 1958, is one of the principal revenue sources for
local government, and after deduction of 15% for collection charges, generally
goes to the municipal authorities to finance the provision of urban services
(in Lahore 42.52 goes to WASA).
Functions and Organization
50.      The Department is administered by a Secretary, and Director General.
The Punjab is divided into geographically-based Excise and Taxation divisions
(Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Multan, DG Khan, Sargodha, Faisalabad and
Bahawalpur). There are in addition sections dealing with drug related activi-
ties, administration and accounts, and appeals. Staff comprises approximately
10 senior level officers, 50 excise and taxation officers (who act as collec-
tors), 150 assistant taxation officers, 650 inspectors and 2,040 constables,
clerical, and support staff, totalling some 2,900. The Lahore Division is the
largest, with 700 staff including 14 excise and taxation officers. Property
tax is paid on an assessed annual rental value (ARV) which is assessed every
five years, based on size, location, and physical condition of the property.
Assessments are hand delivered, and tax is paid half-yearly. In Lahore,
taxable properties are distributed as follows:

51.      E & T are a major collector of revenue for GoPunjab and their activi-
ties represent an important means of resource mobilization. Table 2 below
shows the extent of these resources:

Other Taxes                      370           27            17.51
This represented about 501 of provincial tax receipts for FY87, highlighting
the central role of E & T. Fifteen percent of the tax collected by E & T is
retained, and the balance (Rs 1182 m in FY87) goes to finance city services:
While property tax has grown in current terms, there has been almost no growth
in real terms per urban inhabitant given the rapid growth of the cities
(3.5-71 p.a.). Numerous tax anomalies, exemptions and inconsistencies have
undermined the equitable application of property taxes and prevented revenue
growth, leading to poor urban services and a massive shelter backlog. Record
keeping is manual, and administration and management of the system is very
difficult given the substandard facilities and working conditions. Management
information is not readily available. Systems and methods in practice have
not had the advantage of recent review or modern technology, and E & T
management consider that there is considerable scope for streamlining and
improving assessment, management, and collection, and productivity. The
project will finance (a) modernization of equipment, facilities and record
keeping; (b) pilot programs to explore tax enhancement and streamline collec-
tion strategies and methods; (c) campaigns to improve public relations and
understanding of the role of property tax; and (d) manpower development
through on-the-job training and study tours.

PAKBTAN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
PUNJAB URBAN DEVELOPMET PROJECT
Lahore Devlomenqt Authority (LDA) - Financial Projections
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW OF LDA
1.       LDA generates recurrent income from charges for building permits,
from plant hire and property leases, from interest on investments and from a
number of minor miscellaneous sources. In FY87, Rs 59 million were raised in
this way. The amount was insufficient to meet recurrent expenditures, which
totalled Rs 82 million in FY87, or Rs 62 million net of costs which were
capitalized, and this led to a current account deficit of Rs 3 million. LDA
has had a current account deficit each year since FY85.
2.       LDA's financial strength is derived from its development activities.
In FY87, LDA's capital income amounted to Rs 421 million. Of this,
approximately 40% resulted from development of housing schemes, 352 from other
land development activities including funds for slum upgrading, and the
remaining 25% from the Annual Development Program (ADP) and other sponsored
development programs. The capital expenditures in the year of Rs 428 million
included reinvestment in further housing land development (402), expenditures
on ADP and other sponsored development (302), expenditure on slum upgrading
and miscellaneous items (221), and the balance of 82 was spent on city-wide
infrastructure development schemes sponsored by IDA itself. In total, just
over 60% of LDA's FY87 capital expenditure is financed by LDA's own
revenue-generating activites-principally its housing scheme developments.
3.       The PUDP program, amounting to Rs 1,008 million ($44.4 million) over
seven years, will be financed 881 by loan, the balance being technical
assistance which is grant aided. The debt service commitment arising from
this loan is estimated to reach a peak of Rs 84 million ($3.7 million) in
FY95. In order to service this debt, finance any additional current account
deficits, and continue to expand its program of development of social
infrastructure, it is necessary for LDA to continue to enhance its
revenue-generating capacity.
4.       This is planned to be achieved through increasing the surplus that
LDA earns on its housing developments by increasing the scale and efficiency
of the program, and by revising the pricing policy for land sales. It is
estimated that by FY92, land sales will account for over 501 of LDA's capital
income, and over two-thirds during the period FY94 through FY97.

ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 2
5.       Until now, development land has been acquired at well below market
price (under the 1973 Land Act, now superceded) and on deferred payment
terms. LDA could sell developed plots on a "no profit/no loss" basis well
below market value, and still cover its costs. Under current legislation,
land must be acquired at prevailing market prices. This change emphasizes the
need to LDA to adopt a more commercial approach to its land development. It
adds further to the costs and risks of land development, and these factors
need to be fully reflected in LDA's land sales policy.
6.       The assumptions underlying the financial forecast (which are
explained in detail in the Project File) envisage that on average, including
the surplus generated on commercial plots within housing developments, LDA's
future schemes should generate a surplus of 76S over costs, at base prices.
This assumption produces a financial forecast showing continuing growth in
reserves, after providing for construction finance, throughout the project
period. This forecast is, however, highly sensitive to changes in sales
prices and development aosts. If either 102 lower sales prices or 20Z higher
development costs occur, the forecast shows a deficit in reserves still
continuing at the end of the project period.
7.       The assumptions adopted in the forecast have been discussed and
agreed with LDA officials with a knowledge of the Lahore land market and the
demand for housing plots. Confirmation will be sought during negotiations
that LDA should adopt a land pricing policy which includes an allowance to
finance non-revenue generating investments. The LDA technical assistance
program includes six man-years of assistance to study and implement
improvements to pricing policies and cost recovery, improvements to
develyo.ent programming and implementation efficiency, and financial
management strengthening. On this basis, the PUDP investment by LDA is viewed
as being affordable.
8.       The forecasts are in Tables 1-3 attached to this annex.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
PUNJAB URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Intermediate Cities - Financial Projections
FINANCLAL OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT INTERMEDIATE CMES
1.       In each of the cities of Sialkot, Multan and Gujranwala, the octroi
tax is the largest single source of municipal income. Some 75S of total
current income is generated by three sources: octroi tax, property tax and
property transfer tax.
2.       The three intermediate cities collected approximately the same amount
of octroi per head of population in FY81. In the period through FY87, real
terms per capita yields have increased by 3.52 and 2.52 per annum in Sialkot
and Multan, but have declined in Gujranwala.
3.       Total current income collection per head is highest in Sialkot.  It
has grown by an average 4% per annum since 1980/81, and is now, at Rs163, over
one-third higher than equivalent collections in Lahore. Collections in Multan
have also grown at 41 per annum in real per capita terms since 1980/81, and
although no real growth has taken place since 1984/85, collections are still
101 higher than in Lahore. Total current income yields in Gujranvala, on the
other hand, have fallen by just over 1% per annum, measured on the same basis,
and in 1987/88 amount to only 601 of Sialkot's budgeted yield.
4.       Current expenditure (excluding debt service) is dominated by staff
costs which amount, in 1987/88, to Rs44 per head, or 451 of operating
expenditure in Sialkot, Rs7O or 701 in Multan, and Rs41 or 621 in Gujranwala
(Equivalent figures for Lahore are Rs72 or 771).  Real per capita current
expenditure has increased in all intermediate cities, and it now represents
some 601-65% of total expenditure in each of the cities.
5.       Of the intermediate cities, only Gujranwala has any existing debt
service commitment. Its 1987/88 debt service was only 91 of the surplus of
current income over operating costs, and was therefore covered more than 11
times.
6.       Capital expenditure has, to date, been financed almost wholly from
internal sources. The 1987/88 level of expenditure, on a per capita basis, is
Rs66 in Sialkot, Rs46 in Multan and Rs43 in Gujranwala (Lahore spent some Rs5O
per capita in 1986/87, and can finance approximately the same in 1987/88).
Both Sialkot and Gujranwala have maintained, with one or two years'
exceptions, approximately a constant level of capital expenditure since
1980/81. Multan, however, has increased its level of investment (on a real
per capita basis) from only Rs7 in 1980/81, to a peak of Rs66 in 1986/87.

ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 2
It would appear that in recent years this level of expenditure has only
been made possible by extensive depletion of reserves, which now appear to
be exhausted. Finance for future investment by Multan Corporation would
thus appear to be tightly constrained.
7.      Definitive information is not available about the level of monies
owed to, and by, the municipal corporations, so it is not possible to form
a comprehensive view of their financial status. Neither Sialkot nor, as
noted above, Multan appears to have substantial reserves (regulations
require a year end balance of 52 of current income, but both coporations
appear to expect a small deficit balance at the end of 1987/88).
Gujranwala appears to maintain reserves at a level higher than would be
warranted by cash flow requirements, but the existence of this level of
reserves arises from calculations of past expenditures, rather than from
audited accounts. We are however satisfied that there are not major
unreported debts.
8.      The impact of project expenditure is illustrated by reference to
1987/88 levels of activity. In Sialkot. project investment rises to Rs33
per head (base prices) in 1990-91, or 502 of the level of the capital
program in 1987/88. The associated debt service, deflated to 1987/88
prices, is covered five times by the surplus of 1987/88 current income over
operating costs in the year of maximum debt charges (1994/95). In
Gujranwala, the Project represents less than 25S of current capital program
activity, and resultant debt service (at its maximum) is covered ten times
by the 1987/88 surplus. The sum of 1987/88 budgeted debt service on
existing loans and the maximum project-related debt service would still be
covered five times by the 1987/88 level of surplus. There is no direct
project investment in Multan Municipal Corporation.
9.      The projected financial statements appear in Tables 1-6 attached to
this annex.
