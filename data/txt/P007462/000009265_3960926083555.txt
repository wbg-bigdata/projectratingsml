JAMA,ICA
PUILIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR ADJUSTMENT OPERATION
LOAN SUMARY
Borrower:                    Jamaica
Amount;                      US$20.0 million.
Terms:                       Payable in 17 years, including a grace period
of 4 years at the standard variable interest
rates
Loan Description:            The proposed loan would be in support of the
Government's program of structural adjustment;
it would enhance the actions taken under the
first three SALs by further improving overall
fiscal performance. More particularly the
proposed operation will assist the Government
to address: (i) monitoring and control of
public enterprises; (ii) improved operating
balances of public enterprises targeted; (iii)
elimination of intergovernmental arrears, and
(iv) a reduction In the size and scope of the
public sector. The loan would finance Imports
of raw materials, intermediate goods, non-
luxury consumer goods, capital equipment and
spare parts*
Disbursement Estimate:       The loan would be disbursed in two tranches.
It is anticipated that the first tranche of
US$10 million vould be disbursed soon after
loan effectiveness. The second tranche of
US$10 million would be released subject to a
review of the adjustment program to be held
within six months from loan effectiveness.
Risks:                       The success of the Government's adjustment
program faces certain risks. The pace of
future economic recovery is dependent upon a
variety of oxternal factors beyond the
Government's control. Tourism can exhibit
significant year to year volatility. Further,
domestic and foreign investor confidence can
be affected by a variety of factors outside of
the economic incentive framework and this
could influence the pace of the public
enterprise divestment program and the response
of producers to the changing tariff and trade



- li -
regime. Finally, much will depend upon the
administrative capacity and comlitment of the
Government to carry out the adjustment
program. In this latter case the Government
has demonstrated a willingness to take
politically difficult economic actions. In so
doing, it has continued to enjoy a significant
measure of national support. As a result, the
risks associated with the project are
acceptable.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR A
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
1.       I submit the following report and recomendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$20.0 million to Jamaica for a Public
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan. The loan would have a term of 17 years
including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY1
Introduction
2.       An Economic Report entitled "Economic Situation and Public
Investment' was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1985.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.       Since Jamaica became independent in 1962, the nation has
experienced three distinct phases of economic performance. Each phase has
been determined by events in the foreign sector accounts and has followed a
course determined largely by the character of domestic reactions to those
events. The first of these, which lasted through the 1960s and somewhat
beyond, was an era of strong growth of real output. The main factors were
domestic financial stability coupled with direct foreign investment in the
bauxitelalumina and tourism sectors. During this period the nation enjoyed
a steady accumulation of foreign capital and productive facilities.  Some
of the growth of production was from newly-established import-substituting
industries, and their relative inefficiency proved harmful later in the
decade as unemployment began to climb. Nevertheless, key Jamaican prices
were relatively stable and moved in a pattern that was broadly consistent
with price movements internationally.
4.       The second phase was very nearly the opposite of the first.  Early
in the 1970s, production began to fall. Sharp increases in Jamaica's
petroleum import bill occurred, but were more than compensated by rising
bauxitelalumina related earnings. The public sector grew rapidly as
Government attempted to boost employment   Domestic monetary and credit
expansion accelerated, local prices diverged from international prices, and
a sharp erosion of physical and financial capital occurred. Finally, the
structure of incentives became increasingly biased toward the production of
nontradable goods and services rather than production for export.
1/ Parts I, II, III and IV of this report and of the President's Report
for the companion Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment loan are
identical.



-2-
Recent Developments
5.       In 1980, the country entered a third phase when the Jamaican
Government launched an ambitious economic recovery and adjustment program,
alimed at restoring economic growth and correcting the structural imbalance
in the external accounts. To this end, since 1981 the Government has
entered a series of arrangements with the International Monetary Fund and
has received three structural adjustment Jo#ns from the World Bank. This
recovery program has been hampered by adverse external events. When the
initial stabilization and structural adjustment program was formulated in
1981/82, Jamasca was exporting about 12 million tons of bauxitelalumina
with gross export earnings of about US$669 million, or 752 of total
merchandise exports. The assumption that this level of output would be
maintained proved to be seriously wrong. By 1985 it became evident that
the fall in volume and earnings, to about US$280 million, was not a
temporary phenomenon, but a reflection of more fundamental problems within
the sector and the worldwide oversupply situation.
6.       The decline in the bauxite/alumina sector in Jamaica has provided
a graphic illustration of the openness of the economy, and its
vulnerability to the external sector. The modest real growth that was
recorded in the early 1980's, was offset by nogative growth in 1984 and
particularly the sharp decline of 4.2S in 1985. However, the problems of
the mining sector mask the real adjustments that have occurred in the
economy over the recent past. Agriculture, manufacturing and tourism have
all displayed growth since 1981. Tourism in particular has recovered very
rapidly to become the country's leading foreign currency earner, and with a
12% increase in stopover visitors in 1986 has been a major contributor to a
restoration of real positive growth. This is estimated to be about 2.22 in
1986. In addition, there has been a significant fiscal adjustment in the
past year, with an estimated overall fiscal deficit of 9.42 of GDP. This
compares to a range of 132 to 222 for the previous five years. This fiscal
adjustment has been due to a variety of reforms that have been undertaken
since FY82183, and which are now becoming effective. First, there has been
a significant improvement in tax revenue, as a result of increased fuel
taxes accruing to the Government following the oil price declines, improved
tax administration and higher stamp duties on Imports. Second, there has
been substantial restructuring and reduction of both current and capital
expenditures of the Central Government. Third, there has been continued
improvement in the financial performance of the public enterprises due
primarily to increased tariffs for the major utilities. In addition, over
the past three years, the structural composition of the overall public
sector deficit has been changing. While very dramatic reductions in the
Central Government's deficit have been achieved, the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ)
has incurred heavy deficits as a result of foreign exchange losses arising
out of the large devaluations. For example, the deficit of the Central
Government and public enterprises declined from 14.52 of GDP in FY81/82 to
an estimated 8.81 of GDP in FY85186, but Bank of Jamaica losses--which were
negligible in FY81/82--rose to 7.12 of GDP by FY85186 thereby reducing the
apparent fiscal adjustment.
7.       Furthermore, progress has been made in restoring viability to the
balance of payments. The substantial devaluations of the J$ in 1984 and
1985 have caused the import level to fall back, and this now stands below



- 3 -
the level recorded In FY80181. More recently, the decline in International
oil prices has resulted in a sain of about US$100 million in FY86187,
equivalent to about 42 of GDP. This has also enhanced the cost
competitiveness of the bauxitelalumina sector which uses oil fired
smelters. On the export side, there has been significant growth In teurism
revenues, with a doubling of net receipts over the past six years. Non-
traditional exports outside the CARICOM market have grown from US$80
million in FY80181 to US$144 million in FY85186, with a strong Incr.awe
(about 502) for the two years following the major devaluations in early
FY84/85. This rapid growth disappeared in 1Y86187, due possibly to the
maintenance of the exchange rate of J$5.50 to US$1.00 and the consequent
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate by about 12 to 142 by
December, 1986. Under the present Stand-by program with the IHV (see
para 12), the Government has implemented a scheme for manufactured exports
providing for a duty rebate of 7.52 in FY87188, and this Is expected to
restore the momentum in growth of non-traditional manufactured exports.
Restoration of earlier export levels for traditional products (sugar and
bananas) has been disappointing; however, the ongoing rehabilitation
program for the banana industry is now progressing well, with exptorts in
1985 twice the level recorded in 1980.

8.       With these developments, the current account of the balance of
payments has improved significantly. Provisional estimates suggest a
deficit of about 7.5 of GDP in FY86187, about half the level recorded In
the previous two years. Simultaneously, however, there has been a
substantial build-up in external debt, to US$3.5 billion (151S of GOP) as
of March 31, 1987.  Though much of thl' external debt has been accumulated
on reasonable terms, the decline in export earnings has resulted in a steep
rise in the debt service ratio, to a level of 72S before rescheduling, or
about 51X after rescheduling for FY86/87. The World Bank now holds 14.82
of debt outstanding and obligations owing to the IMF are equivalent to 3652
of quota as of March 31, 1987.

The IMF and the Trigartite Mission
9.       Jamaica has entered into four separate arrangements with the IMF
since 1980, an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in March 1981, a
one-year Stand-by covering FY84185, a 22-month Stand-by approved in June
1985t and the present Stand-by program which was approved in March 1987.
Coinciding with the decline of bauxite/alumina exports, Jamaica has had
severe difficulties in maintaining compliance with the stabilization
program. The main reasons for this have been due to over-optimism
concerning the level of expected foreign exchange earnings including the
disbursements of external assistance, the lack of speedy reaction by
Government authorities to changed circumstances, and some slowness in
implementing agreed adjustment measures.
10.      After the failure to attain the targets under the third IM?
arrangement in September 1983, the Prime Minister requested the Managing
Director of the IMF, in cooperation with the President of the World Bank
and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) to mount a tripartite 'fresh eyes' mission to Jamaica
to review the situation, and identify policies which would be expected to
reestablish economic growth. The mission visited Jamaica in January-
February 1986, and presented its report to the Government In mid-April
1986. The most important conclusions of the mission were as followss
(i)  the macro-policy mix was inappropriate.  In particular, the
report found that monetary policy was too tight, and that the
exchange rate ws consequently being repressed to the
disadvantage of exporters. Furthermore, the mission emphasized
that inadequate progress had been made on fiscal policy. Thus,
it recommended a program of major fiscal adjustment to reduce
the crowding out of private sector investment and the relaxing
of exchange rate policy to promote export diversification and
sustainable growth;



(it) to achieve fiscal adjustment, a major contribution should be
sought from the public enterprises, both through Improved
financial performance and through divestment;
(ili) in addition to a lesser emphasis on tight monetary policy,
instruments of monetary policy should be reformed in such a way
as to remove bias against the private sector;
(iv) the trade and Incentives system, though improved over the whole
structural adjustment period, still was In need of reform to
remove remaining anti-export biast
(v) programs to protect the poor during the period of adjustment
deser-ed support, but should be adequately targeted, rather
than in the form of generalized subsidies; and
(vi) continued high levels of external assistance would be required
and justified if Government were to undertake a major
adjustment effort, and much of this assistance would need to be
concessional policy-based assistance, disbursing as balance of
payments support.
11.      The Government accepted the medium-term objectives proposed, but
expressed reservations about the implied pace of adjustment and the use of
further exchange rate devaluations. As a result, the 22-month Stand-by
with the IMF, which was inoperative since March 1986, was cancelled in July
1986. However, by December 1986, agreement was finally reached on a new
Stand-by to run from March 1987 to March 1988. During the recent intensive
policy dialogue with the IMF and the Bank, the Government has reduced its
public investment plans and implemented further revenue measures, with the
result that the overall fisca deficit for FY86187 has declined
significantly to about 9.42 of GDP. In addition, balance of payments
performance has proven to be better than projected by the Tripartite
Mission, mostly as a result of better than foreseen tourism revenues, lower
service payments, and a lower oil bill.
12.      The new Stand-by arrangement addresses some of the issues
identified above in para 10(i), more specifically, the need for further
fiscal adjustment and monetary policy reforms. It also contemplates
exchange rate adjustment, siould the planned increase in foreign reserves
not materialize, and limits wage increases and inflation to protect
competitiveness. This Stand-By arrangement and the Compensatory Financing
Facility (CFF) purchase for SDR85.0 million and SDR40.9 million
respectively, will support a further reduction in the overall fiscal
deficit to 5.42 of GDP in FY87/88. In addition, monetary policy is to be
closely monitored, with a programed growth in broad money of 102. In the
balance of payments, the current account deficit is targeted to further
improve in FY87188, recording a deficit of about 6.32 of GDP. The proposed
sector adjustment loan, along with the companion Trade and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan would help address issues (ii), (iii) and (iv). The third
member of the Tripartite Mission, USAID, is assisting the Government in
formulating a program to address issue (v) through the introduction of a
food stamp and other targetted subsidy programs. Finally, the Bank, as
Chairman of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development



- 6 -
(COCED), is coordinating external assistance to Jamaics to address issue
(vi). The two proposed sectoral operations would form an integral part of
the external assistance to be mobilized In support of the adjustment
program.
PART II - PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
Introduction
13.      Three structural adjustment loans (SALs) have been made to Jamaica
by the Bank since 1982, for a total of US$190 million together with
structural reform efforts undertaken with the assistance of USAID.
Nevertheless, in 1987 Jamaica's economic situation demands that additional
adjustment and further structural policy reforms be taken to restore longer
term viability &nd sustained growth. The scope of reforms already
undertaken was designed on the basis of a set of assumptions about the
external environment which have proved to be incorrect. This relates in
particular to ssumptions concerning the bauxite/alumina sector. Indeed,
if net earnings from the bauxite/alumina sector had been the same in
FY85186 as in FY80181, and assuming the same degree of policy reform, then
the current account deficit on the balance of payments would have been 8.4S
instead of 14.21 of GDP and the fiscal deficit would been 7.32 instead of
15.9S of GDP. The amount of adjustment required to restore viability and
growth to the Jamaican economy has therefore been a moving target, with the
attainment of objectives always being steps ahead of the most recent
adjustment program.   However, recent improvements in Jamaica's balance of
payments and fiscal accounts, together with an improved internati. -al
outlook for the bauxite and alumina sector provide a better basis for the
,ountry to take advantage of the reforms already undertaken. The previous
structural adjustment mesasures have laid a good basis on which to build the
next phase of adjustment. The policy reforms that were carried out under
the first three SALs are described in Annex III. Of particular importance
are the moves to a more realistic exchange rate, removal of distortions in
the trade regime, reforms of the tax system, reforms of public investment
programming, Improved public enterprise performance5  nd rejuvenation of
the agricultural sector. Details of the main reforms that have been
carried out to date are outlined below.
The Foreign Exchange Allocation Mechanism
14.      The foreign exchange allocation mechanism has evolved gradually
from a tightly controlled, restrictive fixed market regime, to a flexibly
managed system. In 1980, there was a fixed exchange rate of J$1.78 -
US$1.00, and official foreign exchange was allocated administratively, in
conjunction with the Import licensing regime. This has evolved, through a
variety of interlm foreign exchange allocation systems, to the present
auction system, which permits bidding by all potential users of foreign
exchange. Under the new exchange arrangements, the Jamaica dollar
depreciated in real effective terms by about 452 from the third quarter of
1983 to the third quarter of 1985. After a further drop in October 1985,
when the exchange rate briefly reached J$6.40 per US dollar the authorities
stabilized the exchange rate at J$5.50 per US dollar in November 1985 by
increasing supply to the auction. This managed auction system has
continued in place to the present.



15.      The Government believes that the real effective depreciation that
has occurred since 1983 is sufficient to improve export competitiveness and
that a return to a fully floating system would be highly destabilizing at
this time, with a high risk of social disturbance. However, the ability of
the 6overnment to maintain the present nominal exchange rate is crucially
dependent upon its success in bringing the fiscal deficit down, keeping
monetary growth under control and ensuring that nominal wage adjustments
economy wide are modest. Under the present IMF Stand-by arrangement, the
Government is committed to allow the exchange rate to adjust further in the
event the FY87188 reserve targets are not being met, or the real effective
exchange rate appreciates significantly.
The Trade Regime
16.      At the start of the program in 1980, there was a rigid import
licensing system covering all imports, backed by some 364 specific
quantitative restrictions (QRs) which offered strong domestic protection.
Together with the overvalued exchange rate, these were considered the main
sources of anti-export bias in the economy. In January 1982, the first set
of 60 QRs were removed as a first step in a five-year program to gradually
eliminate all such restrictions. Import licensing has been progressively
liberalized, such that by April 1984, most raw materials and capital goods
were removed from licensing. In April 1985 licensing was abolished on all
Imports and the remaining QRs were removed, except for those items imported
by the Jamaica Commodity Trading Company (JCTC), items restricted for
security reasons and for some agricultural items. While this was two years
ahead of schedule, it does not appear to have caused severe dislocation,
although a limited number of processed agricultural products were
subsequently placed again on the QR list.
The Financial Policy Reform Program
17.      It was recognized early in the adjustment process that the capital
market had an important role to play in the economic recovery program.
Under the Technical Assistance Loan (Loan No. 2106-JM) which accompanied
the first SAL, a study of the capital market and any constraints to its
enhanced performance was commissioned. Upon completion of this study, it
became evident that these questions were linked to broader issues within
the financial sector, and the Governmont requested the Bank to undertake a
financial sector study. This wa undertaken at the beginning of 1985 and a
report ws presented to Government in April 1985. It examined four main
areass (i) monetary policy; (ii) interest rate policy; (iiI) housing
finance policies and (iv) capital market development. This study forms the
basis for the financial sector component of the proposed Trade and
Financial Sector Adjustment loan; the bulk of reforms considered necessary
have already been taken.
Tax Reform
18.      In 1983 the Government launched a major research exercise with
assistance from USAID to develop a comprehensive tax reform program. This
vork was essentially completed in mid-1985, at which time the Government
established a Parliamentary Commission to examine its findings and make
recommendations for implementation. The Government introduced in January



1986 a revised personal income tax; a revised property tax system in July
1986 and a revised corporate income tax in lanuary 1987. The next step is
the introduction of a General Consumption Tax to replace most existing
indirect taxes by May 1988.
19.      The reform is far reaching.  Under the previous personal income
tax, the initial threshold for taxes was about US$500 per year and the
maximum rate of 562 applied on income over US$2,500 per annum. The result
of this was pervasive evasion, with ever increasing percentages of income
being received in non-taxable form, such as housing and travel allowances.
The sweeping reform introduced in January 1986 raises the initial tax
threshold to about US$1,500 per annum, and taxes all income, including that
received in kind and interest income at a flat rate of 33-1132. The reform
achieves four main aims: (a) the poor are relieved of any income tax
burden; (b) the incentives to work are increased by reducing high marginal
rates; (c) the tax base is broadened by eliminating tax exempt income; and
(d) tax administration is greatly simplified. The revised corporate income
tax also represents a substantial advance on the previous system. The tax
rate was reduced to 33-1/3% (from 452), with increased provisions for loss
carry forward and adjustment of investment and depreciation allowances. As
a result of these reforms, tax revenues from income have increased by 27Z
in FY85186 and are expected to increase by a further 30% in FY86/87.
20.      The present system of indirect taxes (excise duties, consumption
duties, retail sales taxes and other selective taxes and stamp duties) is
highly complex, particularly when both excise and consumption duties are
levied on the same goods at the same level of production. There is an
excessive number of rates, many of which require frequent legislative
action to adjust. Finally, there is limited taxation of services despite
their growing importance in the economy. The Committee on Tax Reform
finalized the preliminary report on adjusting this situation in July 1986,
and a General Consumption Tax to replace all of these indirect taxes is
expected to be enacted soon. This tax will have a much broader base, with
a greatly reduced number of rates, and exemptions only on some basic
commodities and exports. While the revenue impact would be neutral, it
would reduce distortions, simplify the system and increase tax buoyancy.
In addition, introduction of the General Consumption tax will help in the
implementation action of further steps of the Tariff Reform program. This
would ensure that both imports and domestically produced goods receive
equal treatment with respect to indirect taxation.
Public Enterprises and Fiscal Adlustment
21.      A major stated aim of the Government, since the commencement of
the country's present structural adjustment exercise, has been to reduce
the size of the public sector in the economy via sale or lease of assets
and to improve the financial performance of both the Central Government and
the public enterprises. Some progress has been achieved. The Government
has embarked upon an Administrative Reform Program, with World Bank
assistance (Loan No. 2423-JM), a major component of which has been a phased
introduction of performance budgeting and improved financial management
systems. Central Government current expenditure in relation to GDP has
declined steadily throughout the adjustment program from 32.1% of GDP in
FY81/82 to 27.7% in PY85/86, notwithstanding an increase in interest
expenditures on external debt, equivalent to 3.0% of GDP. This adjustment



- 9 -
has been brought about by a decline in wages, following substantial labor
retrenchment in FY84185 and FY85186, particularly in local government and
in the temporary, non established work force. There has also been a
reduction in real wages of the public work force. Nominal wage increases
averaged 11% and 152 in FY84185 and FY85186, respectively, while price
inflation was about 272 and 26% in both years. In addition, there has been
a steady decline in current transfers to support a variety of urban
services, including the elimination of the subsidy for the provision of
rural water, which is now covered by increased water tariffs of the
National Water Commission. Simultaneously, there has been a steady decline
in Central Government capital expenditures from about 122 of GDP in FY81/82
to about 5% in FY85186. These reductions have affected the supporting
economic infrastructure, particularly roads and the maintenance of the
capital stock in the health and education sectors; this declining trend
however, was forestalled in FY86187.
22.      Within the context of the structural adjustment program, attention
has been focused on the 18 largest public enterprises. Of these, the
Banana Company has been divested and the sugar industry Is presently
undergoing restructure and reorganization; the remaining sixteen
enterprises are the subject of the proposed sector adjustment operation.
In FY80/81, the consolidated operating surplus of this targeted group Was
J$4.5 million (on sales of over J$1.5 billion), or O.1S of GDP with net
transfers of J$147.2 million (3.0% of GDP) from the Central Government.
Large losses were recorded in the National Sugar Company, National Hotels
and Properties, Air Jamaica and the Jamaica Omnibus Service (since
dissolved). This poor performance continued to FY82/83. In general, the
poor consolidated operating results in the period FY80181-FY82/83 arose
primarily from a failure to adjust prices, at a time when capital and
overall expenditures were increasing rapidly. To remedy this, a number of
pricing measures were introduced in FY83/84. In November 1983, water and
sewerage tariffs were increased by an average of 67%; electricity tariffs
were raised by an average of 40% in January 1984 to reflect the higher cost
of fuel and petroleum product prices; the latter were also raised in mid-
1983, with gasoline prices rising by 50%. These measures, together with
further improvements in operating efficiencies, had the desired beneficial
results, and the operating surplus for FY83/84 improved to J$197.6 million
(2.92 of GDP); not transfers from Central Government declined to J$115.7
million (1.7% of GDP). Further price adjustments occurred in FY84/85 for
water (69%), electricity (542), telephone services (502 to 1002), basic
foods (45Z to 1602), and petroleum products (232), with the result that the
consolidated surplus improved to J$370.4 million (4.0% of GDP); Central
Government transfers declined marginally in relative terms. This
improvement continued in FY86/87; the estimated operating surplus is
expected to reach J$1227.3 million, equivalent to 9.62 of GDP.
23.      The Government is committed to continue its efforts.  The hotel
leasing program is now completed, with the result that operating losses of
the National Hotels and Properties have been eliminated. Two publicly-
owned sugar factories are being reorganized, with a view to production of
ethanol for export, and the remaining operations being brought under a
foreign management contract. The National Sugar Company has been replaced
with a debt free holding company, with past accumulated losses to be
absorbed by the Central Government. The Banana Company, as noted, has been
divested, and other entities have been targeted for similar treatment. The



- 10 -
Jamaica Broadcasting Company, for example, is to be radically altered with
a variety of Its facilities to be leased to private sector operators. The
broadcasting company has improved both service and financial viability.
Finally, the water utility has been reformed and restructured with a
resultant improvement In the quality of service.
The Public Sector Investment Proxram
24.     A major effort has been made to improve the quality of the
preparation, execution and monitoring of the public sector Investment
program (PSIP). The main features of the revisions to the PSIP system have
been: the establishment of a rolling three-year investment programs
greater balance in the program with the emphasis being placed on oconomic
infrastructure and support for the export effort; the introduction of a
monitoring system, which produces quarterly progress reports; the
establishment of an inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the Prime
Minister, to approve the PSIP and individual projects; the application of
more appropriate project selection criteria within sectors, and the
integration of the PSIP process with the budget process, such that the
first year of the PSIP is now identical with the capital formation
component of the budget.
Structural Adiustment and Poverty Alleviation
25.      Successive governments in Jamaica have attached considerable
importance to the alleviation of poverty over the past twenty years and
progress has been achieved. Life expectancy at birth has risen (presently
72.5 years at birth); calorie intakes average about 1202 of daily
requirements; there is universal access to primary education and about 852
of the population has access to safe water. However, the pervasive
transformation and structural adjustment of the economy over the past six
years, has affected income distribution, poverty and the quality and
quantity of government services. A Household Expenditure Survey was
completed in early 1985, and results suggest that real consumption has
fallen since 1975, as the economy has stagnated. However, there has been a
moderate decrease in income inequality suggesting that adjustment has been
spread throughout the economy. In addition, there has been an increase in
the self employed, particularly in non-agricultural areas, and a decline in
Government employment. Progress has been made in reducing unemployment,
however, the level is still high, and estimated to be between 202 to 232 of
the work force. The Govertment operates a variety of public assistance
programs to support the poorest sections of the community. There is a food
stamp program, a school lunch program, and a special nutrition program for
groups at high risk of malnutrition (pregnant women, lactating mothers and
pre-school children). The Government also subsidizes the prices of certain
basic foodstuffs through the pricing policy of JCTC. In addition, there
are a variety of Government agencies designed to improve vocational
training for school leavers. Under the two proposed sector sdjustment
operations, the reforms that will be undertaken are not expected to create
greater hardships for the poorer sections of the Jamaican comunity.
Reforms in the public enterprise sector should help to improve efficiency
over the medium term, thereby reducing costs and Improving the level and
quality of services provided. Furthermore, explicit efforts are to be made
to review the food subsidy programs to ensure that the targetted benefits
accrue to those most in need. Under the proposed Trade and Financial
sector adjustment loan, the tariff reform program is to be phased gradually



- 11 -
over a period of four years, and in recognition of the need to mitigate
some of the social costs of adjustment, no basic foodstuffs are included in
those groups of zero tariff items which will have a positive tariff applied
by March 1988. In addition, the whole tariff reform program is designed to
allow the economy to become more competitive in those areas of production
which tend to have relatively high laborlcapital ratios. Therefore, in the
medium term, as the tariff reform progresses, the pace of job creation
should increase significantly, 1- .efitting the presently unemployed and
future school leavers.
PART III - PROSPECTS FOR THE JAMAICAN ECONOMY - 1986187 - 1990/91
26.      The economic outlook for the Jamaican economy is dependent upon
timely policy action, to reduce the fiscal deficit considerably over the
next two to three years, and to adjust the exchange rate system, should
dowastic cost and price inflations exceed that prevailing in Jamaica's
m-jor trade partners and competitors. With these key reforms, and with the
adoption of the reform programs to be supported by this and the
accompanying Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment loan, a major
contribution will have been made to a restoration of growth and balance of
payments viability. However, this growth will continue to be dependent
upon large inflows of concessional assistance from donors, especially over
the next three years but at a reduced level compared to the period 1983 to
1985. Furthermore, given the debt burden facing Jamaica, and the extent of
the structural imbalance since the collapse of bauxitelalumina exports, it
is expected that only a modest increase in living standards can be achieved
before FY90/91.
The Domestic Sector
27.      Given the present tighter financial situation which will inhibit
public sector investment growth, it is considered unlikely that GDP growth
will be as high in FY87188 as in FY86187. However, this growth should pick
up steadily to reach about 3.51 in real terms per annum by 1992. To
achieve these higher growth rates, consumption should increase modestly
over the next four years (at about 1.51 per annum). This will require that
the present tax effort is maintained and that monetary policy is conducted
in a manner that ensures a modest growth of consumer credit. If
consumption increases faster, resources for investment will be preempted
and the prospects for growth will worsen.
28.      A program of sustained growth and adjustment must be based on
increased domestic savings. If, after a period, the average savings rate
does rise, this would lay the groundwork for further growth and for future
increases in consumption. The program of adjustment is predicated on gross
domestic savings increasing by about 8.5 per annum, in real terms, from
1986 to 1991, such that the ratio of domestic savings to GDP would increase
from 8.7% in FY86/87 to 14.81 in FY90/91. Under this scenario, marginal
savings rates, both public and private, must increase over the next few
years, with public savings accounting for about 341 of total domestic
savings by 1990.



- 12 -
29.      The reduction in the public sector deficit in the first year is
assum-d to be accomplished mainly through increased Central Government
reveaues resulting from additional tax measures and a maintenance of
present tax receipts from oil products, and declines in expenditures from
the postponement of non-priority investments and improved public enterprise
management. Subsequent Improvements are predicated on modest growth in
current expenditures, continued improvements in public enterprise
performance, as well as revenues obtained through divestiture. Such
Improvements in the public sector would permit the overall public sector
deficit (including the BOJ) to decline from an estimated 9.4% of GDP in
FY86187 to 2.21 in FY91192.
30.      This scenario of growth and adjustment can be realized only if the
ratio of total investment to GDP rises from 12.42 to about 16.0% by
FY91192. The growth in public sector investment is expected to be modest
such that by FY91192, this investment would be about 9.0% of GDP. While it
might be desirable to raise that rate, there is little room for maneuver
within the Central Government budget, given the large interest payments.
With this projected level of GDP and investment, a modest decline in
unemployment of about 3 to 42 should occur primarily through growth in
labor-intensive export oriented activities. Projections for the domestic
accounts are shown in Table 4.
31.      The leading sector for the economy over the next decade will be
tourism, followed by continued growth in non-traditional manufacturing and
agriculture, and as such investment should be concentrated in these areas.
Very little growth is projected in the bauxitelalumina and sugar sectors,
however, as the banana rehabilitation program continues, it is projected
that banana output should double by 1990, with more modest growth
thereafter. Given that there is considerable underutilized capacity in the
economy and that the ratio of private to public investment will increase,
it is expected that the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) will
decline over the next five years to reach about 4.8 by FY91192. The levels
of investment shown in these economic projections are based on this ICOR
assumption, which is similar to that assumed by the Tripartite Mission's
report.
The External Accounts
32.      Exports of goods and non-factor services are projected to grow at
3.12 a year in real terms, from FY85186 to FY90191. This overall growth
rate includes a higher growth rate of 121 a year in constant prices for
non-traditional exports outside CARICOM; an increase in tourism earnings of
8.8% per year; and a small growth of other exports. It can be argued that
the decline in the bauxite sector has been arrested and that some small
growth can be expected in the future, especially if oil prices do not
increase significantly. Imports are projected In the scenario to grow
slightly lower than the growth rate of GDP. Despite import substitution
efforts, particularly in agriculture, the economy, and especially exports,
will continue to depend on significant amounts of Imported capital goods
and raw materials. These growth projections are based upon the continued
existence of a competitive exchange rate. As such, careful monitoring of
the real effective exchange rate will be necessary with prompt adjustments
being made when appropriate.



- 13 -
33.        Significant improvements are projected in the current account
balance relative to GDP (from a deficit of 14.22 of GDP in FY85/86 to a
deficit of 1.0% of GDP by FY90/91) and in the debt/GDP and debt/export
ratios. Annual flows of foreign capital to the public sector are projected
to decline over the next decade, after FY87/88, both In gross and in net
terms. However, because of the large amounts of annual amortization of
existing debt, even modest net capital inflows must involve large gross
financing. The requirement for balance of payments support will decline
after FY88189 to a level in FY90/91 nearly half that required in FY85186.
In addition to new capital Inflows, substantial debt rescheduling, both by
commercial banks and official creditors, amounting in total to about US$460
million, is also assumed to continue through 1989/90. Beyond 1990 there
would be no need for further rescheduling. The scenario assumes that
private capital inflows over the period will remain constant at about US$50
million per year. Whether this materializes or not will depend greatly on
Jamaica's exchange and interest rate policies, as well as other factors
that influence decisions on foreign equity investment, such as the presence
of the proper regulatory framework and the absence of exchange controls.

34.        Under this projection framework, and on the critical assumption
that Jamaica successfully continues with the main macroeconomic reform
program described above, the external financing gap is closed for FY87/88.
For FY88/89 to FY91/92 there is an external financing gap equivalent to
about 3.53 of GDP (about US$105 million), which will need to be filled by
balance of payments support by traditional multilateral and bilateral
sources, as well as, if possible, by new donors.    Assuming this flow of

external resources is forthcoming, together with the maintenance of project
aid flows at levels similar to that pertaining over the past three years,
the country should be considered creditworthy. Jamaica is continuing to
receive substantial financial assistance from the IMF, bilateral donors and
other multilateral development banks. The Government of Jamaica has
recently concluded rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club on March 5,
1987 and with the commercial banks on March 10, 1987. The situation,
however, is not without risks. The Bank's exposure in Jamaica is high at
14.8% of debt outstanding and disbursed, and this exposure will increase
with the two proposed sector adjustment operations to about 15.52 of debt
outstanding and disbursed.  However, the economic projections, together
with the attendant financing plan, indicate that this exposure would
decline from 1988 on, to about 132 of debt outstanding and disbursed by
1995, and IBRD debt service is expected to decline from 6.4% of exports in
1987 to 4.2Z by 1995.
35.      The projections outlined above are cautious and the growth targets
achievable. It should be noted, however, that the economy is still
vulnerable to external shocks, particularly with regard to major increases
in oil prices or to disruptions that affect the gre.ith of the tourist
sector. Should either of these events occur, then the balance of payments
could deteriorate rapidly, which would aggravate the already significant
debt service burden and reduce the pace of GDP growth. Furthermore, the
balance of payments is very sensitive to changes in the prices of bauxite
and alumina. If prices decline by 102, below that presently projected,
then the current account deficit in FY90191 would be US$46 million higher
(equivalent to 1.52 of GDP) and the cumulative financing gap from FY88/89
to FY90191 would increase by US$130 million. These vulnerabilities
indicate that the country's medium-term economic framework and overall
creditworthiness can change rapidly and as a result will require continued
monitoring.  In particular, prior to second tranche release, compliance
with this medium-term framework, and its attendant external financing plan,
will be reviewed.

PART IV - CONTINUING THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS
The Proposed Sector Adjustment Loans and the Macroeconomic Framework
36.      Achievement of the growth and balance of payments targets proposed
is contingent upon a continued program of structural reform which the
proposed Trade and Financial Sector and Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment
loans are designed to support. While broader issues related to monetary,
fiscal and exchange rate policies are being pursued in the context of the
present Stand-by arrangement with the IMF, the two sector adjustment loans
are designed to improve the incentive framework facing exporters and
improve the operational efficiency of public enterprises. The
interrelationship between the two proposed sector adjustment loans and the
stabilixation program are very close, with each depending on the success of
the other. The choice of the two sectors follows in natural sequence the
prior reforms undertaken. The reform program undertaken in FY87188 would
provide a solid foundation for other needed reform measures. In
particular, future attention would be directed toward further restructuring
of the public enterprise sector and to measures necessary to improve the
agricultural sector's performance. Furthermore, as the tariff reform
progresses in the second and third years, attention would be directed
toward the industrial sector to facilitate the transition to a more
competitive, and less protected, trading environment.
The Proposed Sector Adjustment Loans and Relations with the IMF Arrangement
37.      The two proposed sector adjustment loans would be both supportive
of and dependent on policies agreed to as part of the framework underlying
the arrangement with the IMF. Inherent within the present Stand-by
arrangement is the goal of a further reduction in the overall fiscal
deficit, strengthening of the international reserve position and avoidance
of a rapid appreciation of the real exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar.
In particular, if the real exchange rate appreciates significantly without
appropriate adjustment of the nominal exchange rate, then the reforms in
the trade and tariff regime would be much less likely to encourage the
development of exports, and would be likely to result in further
dislocation in the manufacturing sector, with imports replacing domestic
production. Similarly, it will be much harder to achieve reforms in the
financial sector if the fiscal deficit remains high. Clearly, one
implication of the removal of bias against private sector interest rates
and of the goals of the financial sector reforms, will be higher rates to
the public sector but if the fiscal deficit is not controlled then crowding
out of the private sector could increase.
38.      The two proposed sector adjustment loans would also contribute to
the achievement of the targets of the program with the IMF:
(i) Fiscal deficit: of the projected fiscal improvement about
half would come from the reduction in oil prices and
improvement in tax administration and most of the balance
in FY87188 would come from improved savings of the public
enterprises and divestment under the action programs of the
proposed sector adjustment loan;



- 16 -
(11) Financial volley: the revised financial policy being
supported by the proposed Trade and Financial Sector
Adjustment loan would be directly supportive of the broad
macro economic framwork, and would improve monetary
management in general;
(iII) Balance of _spments: the achievement of viability in the
balance of payments is critically dependent on the growth
of non-traditional exports, and this In turn is dependent
upon reform In the tariff regime and the general incentives
to export implied by these reforms.
39.      Ultimately, however, the crucial interdependence of the two
proposed sector adjustment loans and the IMF arrangement comes from their
collective impact on the restoration of growth. Without economic growth,
the prospects for success In any of the programs are severely dampened, not
only because of the political and social difficulties that would result,
but also because of the nature of the economy. Jamaica is and will remain
import dependent, and the achievement of viability in the balance of
payments will be determined to a large extent by the ability of the economy
to generate new exports and to control the fiscal deficit. The proposed
aggregate set of policies, both macro and sectoral, are designed to
provide room for private sector aetivity, and to expand nontraditional
exports with growth being centered on those areas which will contribute to
the achievement of longer-term viability.
Policy-Based and Proiect Lending 2
40.      There continues to be a close relationship between the Bank's
policy-based lwnding and traditional project lending. Two of the ongoing
projects have particular relevance to the Public Enterprise Sector
Adjustment loan: the Water Supply and Sewerage Technical Assistance and
Rehabilitation Loan (2423-JM) is addressing the financial and technical
performance of the National Water Commission; and the Public Administration
Reform Project (2433-JM) is addressing the management of the public sector
in general, and of the Ministry of Finance in particular. In addition, the
ongoing Industrial Credit Project (2294-JM) and Exports Crops Project
(2414-lM) are providing credit to the sectors that trade reform is designed
to encourage.
41.      Several projects which are expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors for approval in the coming months will continue this
process. The proposed Second Sugar Rehabilitation Project is designed to
address the efficiency of the public sugar sector, thus improving public
finances, as well as rationalizing the amount of land utilized for sugar,
and releasing good land for the development of nontraditional export crops.
The proposed Population and Health Project and the Fourth Education Project
would contain components which would examine the financing of the health
and education sectors, and design cost recovery programs in these sectors.
Finally, the proposed Fourth Power Project would not only continue to
improve the infrastructural base for development, but also concentrate on
the efficiency of the power generation company, with the aim of lowering
the unit cost of electricity production.
2/ Full details on past Bank lending were distributed to the Board, in the
Country Brief dated March 31, 1987.

Loan Amount and Cofinancing
42.      It is proposed that the Public Enterprises Sector Adjustment loan
and the Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment loan should be for US$20
million and US$40 million respectively. Both loans would be made available
in two equal tranches. This compares to the amounts of US$75 million,
US$60 million, and US$55 million for SALs I-III respectively. No
cofinancing is envisaged for this loan. The two proposed sector adjustment
operations together would represent about 5.51 of Jamaica's import
requirements in FY87/88, about 92 of Jamaica's gross financing needs, and
about 251 of net public capital financing needs over the current fiscal
year.
PART V - ISSUES AND ACTION PROGRAMS IN THE PROPOSED
PUBLIC ENTERPRISES SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Background to the Public Enterprise Sector
43.      Since the early 1970s, the size and the role of the public sector
in Jamaica expanded rapidly, to encompass a wide variety of economic
functions. The pace of this expansion, together with a general decline in
Government administrative capacities, has meant that a precise
documentation of the variety of statutory boards, agencies and enterprises
has been difficult. A Government study conducted in 1982 lists 537
separate statutory bodies, inclusive of wholly or partially owned
producti7e enterprises. This register was admitted to be incomplete, but
does include in excess of 200 public enterprises, some 230 statutory boards
and a variety of other agencies and entities, some of which only exist on
paper.
44.      The range of activities of this public enterprise group is
extensive. In addition to normal public utilities, they include: financial
services, transportation and production activities in bauxite/alumina,
sugar, bananas, meat, winter vegetables, cement, garments, shoes, hotels,
furniture and commodity trading. While exact quantification is difficult,
estimates for 1984 suggest that public enterprises accounted for about 21%
of GDP, 11 of employment, 112 of investment and held about 192 of the
country's capital stock. The reasons for this expansion in both size and
activity during the 1970. is a reflection of the previous government's
policy to promote the role of the state in the economy, create employment
during a time of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, and expand social
and economic services.
45.      The financial performance of most public enterprises has not been
good, but as noted in Part II, progress has been made by the Government in
the context of past structural adjustment loans. The operating surplus of
the 16 largest enterprises has improved significantly and there has been
considerable progress toward improved levels of operational efficiency.
The Government has steadily improved its monitoring capacity, and, through
individual management audits carried out and supervised by the National
Investment Bank of Jamaica, set out a variety of rehabilitation action
programs for individual enterprises. In May 1984, a Public Accounting



- 18 -
Commission was established to ensure that auditors' reports were completed
in a timely fashion. Furthermore, the Government has undertaken a
rationalization program for the entire public sector, which has resulted In
a reduction in the number of public entities. Some entities which have
been eliminated include agricultural marketing organizations, enterprises
in the sugar sector, livestock companies, the National Development Agency
(which managed government construction projects), community rent tribunals,
parish tariff authorities, several tourism promotion entities, subsidiaries
of the Agricultural Marketing Corporation and the Jamaica Industrial
Development Corporation, several manufacturing companies, an airline
catering service, the Montego Bay Bus Company and the Jamaica Omnibus
Company. In early 1980 it was estimated there were 643 public entities.
By May 1985, this number had declined to 534, including a reduction through
liquidation or sale of assets of 22 public enterprises. This does not
include the sale of 12 individual banana packing plants.
46.      Despite these reorganization and adjustment efforts,  considerable
scope still exists for further improvements. The proposed Public
Enterprise Sector Adjustment loan would seek to bring about these
improvements on three broad fronts. First, the proposed loan would
encourage and support the Government's stated aim to reduce the size of the
public sector in the economy via sale or lease of assets. Second, the
proposed loan would improve the legal framework necessary to enhance
supervision, control and monitoring by the Central Government. Third,
while the proposed loan would aim to achieve a targeted overall savings
improvement on the larger public enterprises in Jamaica, it would do this
via an in-depth analysis of the operations of the individual enterprises
and related action programs. Since October 1985, additional fiscal savings
of J$478 million have been realized in the targeted sixteen enterprises as
a result of the operational and financial measures taken. This is
equivalent to about 12% of Government revenues.
Divestment
47.      Since 1982 the Government has repeatedly stated its policy of
divesting publicly owned companies, but few concrete results have been
achieved. The main area of success has been in the leasing of hotels to
the private sector, but even in this case, Government has retained
ownership. Indeed, some major acquisitions have even occurred, including
the petroleum refinery and Montego Bay Freeport. In 1985 the Government's
divestmant policy has been revived. The stated strategy is to divest all
commercial operations, except for the traditional utilities, and the
communications and transport sectors. A special secretariat has been
established within the National Investment Bank of Jamaica to carry out
valuation exercises and arrange for sale or lease of publicly owned
companies referred to it by the Government. At the present time, they have
been given 45 such companies, and actions are well advanced on at least
half of these. Eighteen companies of this group have either been sold or
leased by December 1986. Of particular importance was the sale of 512 of
the shares in the National Commercial Bank by public subscription. The
remaining 491 of the shares are to be sold in 1987. The success of this
privatization has given a boost to the Government's divestment policy. The
Government has since issued a Cabinet approved Divestment Policy Paper,
which demarcates the criteria for selection of enterprises, the methods to
be used for disposal of assets and overall elements of the policy.



- 19 -
Fuzthermore, a tentative list of a further 47 enterprises to be divested
has been compiled, with a preliminary estimate of asset values in excess of
J$300.0 million. Given the estimated absorptive capacity of the economy, a
quantified program for divestment has been drawn up, which indicates that
in FY87188, a further 20 enterprises will be divested subject to the
satisfactory conclusion of negotiations that are presently underway. This
pace of progress is considered ambitious, particularly, given the
uncertainties surrounding the domestic economy's absorptive capacity and
the search for foreign investors; if completed, however, 50% of all public
enterprises would have been privatized by March 1988.
48.      Action Program.  A condition of second tranche release would be
satisfactory progress in achievement of the Government's stated divestment
program for FY87188, with completed divestment of at least J$150.0 million
of public enterprise assets.
Supervision and Monitoring of Public Enterprises
49.      The individual enterprise reforms outlined below are an attempt to
bring about an immediate, short-term improvement in overall financial
performance in order to improve the public sector fiscal balance and
reduce credit demands on the banking system. They do not, however, address
the more fundamental, sector-wide problems of the public enterprises in
Jamaica. In most instances, financial difficulties of individual firms are
a manifestation of deep structural problems in the economy. The rapid
growth and diversity of Government's role in the economy over the past
decade has placed demands upon the central administration that it has not
been able to meet. The Ministry of Finance in particular, has found it
difficult to maintain adequate control and monitoring, due, in part, to a
lack of suitably qualified staff, but also to the lack of a clearly defined
system and procedure for this financial control function. The
proliferation of statutory boards and public enterprises has often resulted
in public entities with unclear organization policy guidelines, with the
result that effective financial control is almost non-existent and many
enterprises have been able to incur contingent liabilities and initiate
loan negotiations outside of the normal public sector capital budgeting
procedures. A public enterprise unit has been established within the
Ministry of Finance to improve financial monitoring of the public
enterprise sector. However, given its present staffing, this unit is
unable to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the upper management
echelons of the larger public enterprises. Furthermore, the appropriate
role for the various sector ministries, to which a particular public
enterprise is nominally responsible, has, in most instances, not been
adequately defined. Clearly, to effect more enduring, longer term reforms,
emphasis must also be placed on broader sector-wide reforms that will
define the future operating relationships between the Government and the
public enterprises.
50.      Under the World Bank financed Public Administration Reform Project
(Loan 2423-JM), the Government of Jamaica is endeavoring to improve overall
public sector management and administration, with particular regard to
budgetary and financial matters. The Government has already taken action
to strengthen the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Organizational changes have
been made with appointment of a Budget Director, Controller General
(auditicontrols) and an Accountant General/Treasurer (cash management).



- 20 -
Systmo are presently being designed for an Integrated financial management
program whieh should be completed by the end of 1987. A Financial
Manag emnt Refors Task Force has been establiohed, including a public
enterprise control working group In August 1984. Deliberations of this
group are continuing, and a preliminary draft of findings aad
recaoendstions l under reviev and discussion. These preliminary findings
suggest, besides specific Inadequacies of Individual enterprises, that
overall public sector financial management ti wesk, with a lock of
enforcement of performance requirements, accountability and appropriate
planaing and progress reportitg. Furthermore, these generic problems are
aggravated by interventions In day to day management by Board members, or
other parts of the Government, that further confuse the Issu*s of
appropriate responsibility or accountability.
51.      In part, thes  difficulties are a manifestation of the legal
framwork under which the enterprises operate. Some operate as privato
enterprises under the Companies Act, others under specific enabling
legislation, with the result that there Is a great diverslty In reporting
requirements. The Compaoles Act does not provide a definition for the
enterprises of reporting requirements, responsibilities and functions of
the Ministry of Finance and appropriate line Minlstries, composition of
Boards, and audit criteria, which should be different for companles which
are utilising public rosources and implementing Government policy. In
early 1986, the Government of Jamaica, with assistance from the
International Centre for Public Enterprises in Developing Countries,
undertook a review of tho whole concept of inter-relationships between the
Public Enterprises and agencies of Government. This review wa completed
in June 1986, and concluded that It would be desirable in the Jamaican
context, to lnitiate a Public Enterprises Law. While such a legislation
would retain most, if not all, of the provisions of the present Companies
Law, it would include clear guidelnes with respect to prescribing specific
financial reporting procedurs and formats and establish the requirement of
periodic consultation with the MOP to compare agr ed budgetary targets with
performance. Furthermore, It will provide a means by which the public
enterprise sector can conform to the overall public sector financial
management system that is being put In place.
52.      Action Pror m. The Goverrment of Jamaica has approved the
Issuance of drafting instructions that are satisfactory to the Bank for the
proposed Public Enterprise Law which is expected to be enacted by March,
1988. A copy of these drafting instructions are sbown In Annex II. The
Govetiment of Jamaica has also 0mproved the resources avallable to the
Public Enterprises Division of the Ministry of Finance, Including
appointment of a Deputy Financial Secretary to facilitate the overall
monitoring capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Further, a
decision has been made to allocate financial supervisory responsibility
between the Ministry of Finance and the National Investment Bank of Jmaica
(NIBJ), to the effect that NIBJ would take over responsibility for those
enterprises scheduled for divestment.  It would be a condition of second
tranche release that a draft of this Public Enterprise Law satisfactory to
the Bank would have boen presented to Parliament for consideration.
The Information Base on Public Entergrisos
53.      In conjunction with past GoverAment efforts to Improve Its
capacity to monitor and supervise public enterprises, a variety of ad hoc
attempts have been made to develop a listing and inventory of assets and



- 21 -
liabilities of these enterprises together with adequate income statements.
A comprehensive evaluation, however, has not been done and the lack of this
information inhibits the Government's ability to control the overall public
enterprise deficit, to rationalize the scope of activities of the public
enterprise sector and develop a longer term divestment strategy. The
Government recognizes the need for such a comprehensive accounting
exercise, however, in-house capabilities to undertake such a study are
limited. Nevertheless, the various major accounting firms in the country
are equipped and able to complete such an undertaking with limited external
assistance.
54.      Action Program.  Terms of reference, satisfactory to the Bank,
for this inventory of assets and liabilities (see Annex II) have now been
finalized and the respective consultant accounting firms appointed. A
condition for second tranche release would be completion of this accounting
consolidation and analysis. In addition, prior to second tranche release,
the Government would prepare a program, satisfactory to the Bank that would
outline actions to be taken for all of the public entities included in the
invencory of assets and liabilities. This program would specify
Government's intent with regard to liquidation, divestment, and financial
and managerial restructuring for each enterprise.
Intersovernmental Arrears
55.      A number of public enterprises encounter significant cash flow
difficulties due to late, or non-payment of charges for services rendered
to Central Government departments or other public enterprises. In the
past, budget allocations for some public entitities have not been
sufficient to meet these variety of charges, with the result that arrears
have accumulated between them. Furthermore, the need to borrow from
domestic banking sources to meet these liquidity difficulties, has meant
that costs have been inflated and pricing decisions distorted. These
difficulties and distortions have been recognized by the Government, with
the result that the Government has embarked upon a major reform of the
financial budgeting and control systems in the public sector. Since April
1986 budgeting and control procedures have been substantially revised, and
special provisions have been made to progressively eliminate accumulated
arrears. Within the targeted group of enterprises, the following
provisions have been made:
(a) With effect from April 1986, a schedule for elimination of
Air Jamaica landing fee arrears to the Airport Authority has been drawn up.
This involves the payment of about J$230,000.00 per month by Air Jamaica to
the Airport Authority, over a period of 48 months. This schedule has been
adhered to;
(b) With effect from 1st April, 1987, a schedule for elimination
of all arrears owing by the various Government ministries and departments
to the National Water Commission hs also been drawn up. This involves the
payment of J$2.1 million per month, over a period of 24 months.
Finally, procedures have been put in place to ensure that all Government
departments remain current in monthly billings to the National Water
Commission, the Jamaica Public Service Company, the Jamaica Telephone
Company and the Jamaica International Telecommunications. These include a



- 22 -
revised warrant system which has been introduced as part of the development
of the integrated financial management system and adequate budgetary
provisions for the payment of utility charges.
56.      Action Program.  It would be a condition of second tranche release
that (i) all intergovernmental arrears have been reduced to below 60 days
outstanding, (iI) and that the above schedule for the Airport Authority and
the National Water Commission is being adhered to, and (iiI) that the
Central Government remain current in monthly billings to NWC, JPS, JTC and
Jamintel.
Individual Enterprises - Situation. Prospects and Action Programs
Transportation
57.      Within this group, five public enterprises have been targeted --
Air Jamaica (AJ), Airports Authority (AA), Port Authority (PA), Jamaica
Merchant Marine (JM) and the Jamaica Railway Corporation (JRC).
58.      Air Jamaica operates in a very competitive air traffic
environment. Yields per seat mile on Air Jamaica's route structure remain
relatively low, as corpetitors offer, and are able to price, their Jamaica
services on a variable cost recovery basis. In this context, therefore, it
is crucial that Air Jamaica maintain the highest standards of operational
efficiency. Substantial progress has been made in this. For the first
time in over ten years, a positive operating balance (current balance
excluding depreciation) was achieved in FY85/86. The company's management
recognizes the need to concentrate its efforts on further operational
Improvements and a gradual increase in the yield per revenue passenger
mile. In this context, it is seeking to increase aircraft utilization and
reduce service on unprofitable routes, and in April 1986 completed reviews
of the Cayman Islands and Haitil/San Jose routes. This review indicated
that the former route made a sufficient contribution to warrant
continuation; but not the latter. These improvements are expected to
increase the company's operating balance in FY86187 to U$44.0 million from
J$21.6 million in FY85186. There is also a small government-owned domestic
airline (Trans Jamaica Airlines -- Transjam) that is not profitable or
viable given its present route structure and non-integration with Air
Jamaica's operation. The Government has decided that this domestic airline
will be divested.
59.      Action Program - Air Jamaica.  A variety of actions have already
been undertaken to improve the operating efficiency of this enterprise,
including a review of marginal routes culminating in the termination of the
route to Haiti. In addition, following discussion and review, for the
fiscal year 1987188, Air Jamaica has reduced its proposed investment in
transportation equipment by an amount equivalent to J$22.0 million. To
further improve the company's cash flow position, Air Jamaica has received
Ministry of Finance approval to renegotiate lease arrangements on its wide
body fleet, to cover a longer lease period. This would realize annual
liquidity improvements of between US$2.0 to US$3.0 million. Prior to
second tranche release, Air Jamaica would have completed this lease
renegotiation. Also, Transjam would have been divested; should this not
prove feasible in the time available, the Bank should be satisfied that all
adequate actions for its divestment would have been made.

60.      The finaacial performance of the Airport Authority has improved
significeantly over the past two years (FY84185 and FY85186), generating
operating surpluses of J$7.3 million and J$6.8 million respectively. This
Improvement has been due to rising traffic and the fact that landing and
terminal fees are charged at US$ rates. It Is expected that this
lmprovement should continue such that by FY88/89 this operating surplus
should reach J$10.0 million. Very little room exists for increases In
landing and terminal fees, as these are presently at the highest levels In
the region. The Authority does encounter liquidity problems due to past
arrears for landing fee charges to Air Jamaica. Further, the Government
loan account with the Airport Authority has been regularized, via a
restructuring of the Airport Authority's capital base. This Involved a
conversion of J$54.6 million of Government of Jamaica debt into equity, and
consolidation of the remaining J$53.6 million in a specific loan at 8%
interest per annum, with a 5 year grace period and a 20 year repayment
period. Interest is to be capitalized during the grace period. These
conversions were completed with effect from June 1986.
61.      Action Program - Airport Authority.  The Government has raised the
airport departure tax by 100l to JS$40.0, which should realize a further
J$25.0 million in FY87/88 to the Central Government. A schedule for
elimination of Air Jsmaica landing fee arrears has been completed, and the
airline is remaining current for new charges. Prior to second tranche
release, we would seek verification that this agreed schedule of arrears
elimination has been adhered to.
62.      The Port Authority is a statutory body responsible for overall
supervision of Jamaica's ports. Besides general cargo traffic, Kingston
has a major container transhipment terminal facility that has proven to be
highly successful and profitable for the Port Authority. Danger exists,
however, that with development of a similar transhipment facility in
Panama, Kingston's transhipment business could decline dramatically. Much
will depend upon the Kingston facility remaining cost competitive. The
Port Authority has generated operating surpluses every year since 1980 and
these have been rising continually. In FY86/87 the operating surplus was
J$54.0 million and is expected to be at the same level in FY87188. In
order to expand the Kingston Free Zone, and establish a new one in Montego
Bay and further enhance port facilities, the Port Authority has prepared an
ambitious investment program for FY85186 to FY88189 of some J$187.0
million, of which J$86.6 million will need to come from local sources.
63.      Action Program - Port Authority.  Following review of the
Authority's original investment program, this has now been reduced to
J$123.6 million for the period FY85/86 to FY88/89, resulting in a planned
savir3 of J$63.4 million. Further, in FY87188, provision has now been made
for the payment of corporate taxes and import duties, which is projected to
amount to about J$15.0 million. Prior to the second tranche release, the
financial results of the Port Authority would be reviewed to ensure
conformity with the investment and taxation targets.
64.      Jamaica Merchant Marine.  JMH was established In 1975, and in 1977
joined with the Jamaica Banana Producers Association to form a subsidiary,
JM Atlantic Line, primarily to convey bananas to UK/Europe, returning with
general cargo. The range of services was expanded in the early 19809 to
include grains and general cargo traffic from the US. At present, IM



- 24 -
operates two ships which are supplemented by charter vessels. Despite the
sale of one ship in 1986, the financial position of the entity is critical,
with projected income levels unlikely to make a contribution towards
required interest payment and depreciation. Long-term debt stands at
approximately J$47.0 million, equity is a negative J$1.3 million and
working capital is a negative J$4.1 million at the end of FY84185. At the
present time, JMM is technically bankrupt, with the result that drastic
action is needed if this company is to continue in operation. Given the
very uncertain future of JMM, meaningful projections cannot be derived
until specific policy actions have been decided upon.
65.      Action Protram - Jamaican Merchant Marine.  As noted, steps have
already been taken to dispose of one ship (the Montego Bay II). Prior to
second tranche release, the Government would have completed, and have
received Cabinet approval, of a national shipping policy paper. This study
would address all the options available for ensuring the shipment of
Jam&ica's imports and exports by the cheapest and most efficient means.
Further, this study would delineate the options available to restore
financial viability to JMM, such that a decision may be reached as to the
enterprises's future existence. Should this review by the Government and
the Bank indicate that the sustained operations are not viable then this
enterprise would be liquidated.
66.      The Jamaica Railway Corporation.  JRC is a Government owned
railway system, primarily to transport bauxite for processing, with some
passenger and freight traffic. The economic viability of JRC is open to
serious question, and, with the declining levels of bauxite production over
the past few years, operatin losses have occurred, requiring Central
Government transfers to remain financially viable. The operating deficit
in FY84185 was J$5.8 million. This result does not include interest
payments on outstanding Government guaranteed debts. In 1984, efforts to
improve efficiency were undertaken, which included cutting staff by over
401 and increasing passenger fares by 36S. Despite these measures, the
financial position of JRC was far from secure, and the Government of
Jamaica undertook a review of policy options for continued operation which
was submitted to Cabinet in March, 1986. It was decided to continue with
operations, following a management reorganization and employment of a new
general manager and marketing manager; a renegotiation of the bauxite
carriage charges which raised rates by about 140% over those pertaining in
1984; institution of a voluntary redundancy program and Central Government
assumption of all of JRC's existing commercial bank overdrafts. These
measures have improved JRC's viability, and an operating surplus of J$21.7
million is expected in FY87188.
67.      Action Program - Jamaica Railway Corporation.  The management and
Government review of JRC's policy options and operating scenarios has
concluded that the variable costs of operations are now being covered and
as such, JRC should continue in operation. However, the Government will
undertake a regular quarterly review of financial results to ensure that
the planned improvement in financial performance in fiscal year 1987188 is
being realized. Prior to second tranche release, this situation would be
reviewed to verify actual financial results for the first nine months of
FY87188. Should the improved operating surplus not materialize, all
necessary action for its privatization and/or liquidation of loss
generating services will be taken.

Utilities
68.      The two enterprises targeted within this group, the Jamaica Public
Service Company (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC), are
presently receiving World Bank project assistance. JPS has received three
loans from the Bank (Loan No. 454-JM, 1966, $22.0 million; Loan No. 1516-
JM, 1978, $20.0 million; and Loan No. 2188-JM, 1982, S30.5 million)
designed to expand and update generation, transmission and distribution
capacities. Under these loans, technical assistance and training
components have been incorporated, with a strong emphasis upon an
institutional strengthening program. In the past, JPS's power service has
been unreliable and inefficient due to frequent power outages resulting in
a lack of adequate maintenance and management practices. JPS9s efforts in
recent years, in conjunction with Bank assistance, have led to significant
quality and efficiency improvements in the power service. The heat rate
(BTUIfKWH) a measure of generating efficiency, has improved significantly
from 15267 in 1982 to an estimated 11560 in 1986, and minutes
lost/customers, a measure of reliability, has fallen from 7060 in 1982 to
2387 in 1985. This has been reflected in an improved financial
performance, with a steadily Improving rate of return on assets employed
and operating margin. The cash operating balance (current balance
excluding depreciation) was J$2.3 million (in FY81182 on sales of J$261.3
million. This improved to J$133.1 million (on sales of JS625.9 million) in
FY84/85, to J$175.2 million (on sales of J$801.5 million) in FY85/86, and
to JS285.0 million (on sales of JS734.0 million) in FY86187. It is
expected that this operating balance should reach J$309.0 million (on sales
of JS801.0 million) in FY87/88.
69.      Action Proeram - Jamaican Public Service Com,any.  A tariff study
was completed in May 1986. Prior to second tranche release, the new tariff
structure, based upon the results of this study, would be implemented in a
manner acceptable to the Bank which would affect the operating balances
from FY88189 onwards.
70.      The National Water Commission.  NWC is still encountering
considerable difficulties which are being addressed with assistance from
the Bank's Water Supply and Sewerage Technical Assistance and
Rehabilitation Project (Ln # 2422-JM). This operation has made progress
toward an Improvement of operations, however, a variety of fundamental
problems remain. There is a lack of top to middle managers available to
run the entity. A recruitment drive to Identify suitable technical and
managerial staff has only been partially successful. The uncompetitive
salary structure remains one of the main $mpediments. Furthermore, the NWC
Board plays an important role in day to day operational decisions, with the
result that the decision making process is very slow and management does
not have sufficient authority to carry out its responsibility. Finally,
NWC continues to operate with severe liquidity problems. This shortage of
funds arises from a combination of factors, including the recent merger of
highly subsidised parish water supply operations with NWC, collections
arrears from Government entities, inadequate Government budget allocations
and the failure of tariffs to keep up with rising costs.
71.      Action Program - National Water Commission.  Water tariffs were
adjusted by 88S on January 1st, 1986, which will significantly improve the
Commlssion's financial situation.  To alleviate the necessity for large



- 26 -
single tariff adjustments in the future, it has been agreed by the
Government that NWC tariffs will be adjusted on a semiannual basis, with
the sixe of the adjustment to be determined by an index of the change of
prices of the Commission's major inputs. This was introduced with effect
from April 1st, 1987, with the first adjustment due on October 1st, 1987.
Prior to second tranche release, as part of the regular supervision mission
of the aforementioned Water and Sewerage project, a review of this system
of price adjustment would be completed to ensure that appropriate tariff
adjustments have been made. Also, before second tranche release the NWC's
management and higher technical staff salary structure would be revised to
conform more closely to the salary scales in other public enterprises. The
above and other general management difficulties would be addressed in the
context of the provisions of the newly proposed public enterprise statute
and the ongoing provisions of the World Bank Water Supply operation. The
Government has also drawn up a schedule of arrears elimination that will
improve NWC's liquidity problems, and reiterated its comnituet to ensure
that all Goverument ministries and departments remain current in monthly
billings. Therefore, prior to second tranche release, a review of the
arrears will be made to ensure that the agreed schedule is being adhered
to.
Telecommunications
72.      While there has been a steady improvement over the past five years
in the quality, reliability and accessibility of telecommunication services
in Jamaica, further improvements are necessary to meet consumer demand
(with over 40,000 applications pending on December 31st, 1985) and support
economic development efforts, particularly in tourist areas. Extensivo
delays still occur in the rectification of technical faults, with about 352
of technical faults requiring more than a week to clear. Overall, the
sector does not now have a staff surplus, but efficiency would be enhanced
by restructuring, new procedures, further training and reassignment of
staff. The sector is served by two companies: the Jamaica Telephone
Company (JTC) and Jamaica International Telecommunications (JAMINTEL),
reporting to the Minister of Public Utilities and Transport. These two
companies integrate their operations through a cooperation agreement.
However, for the sector to develop, closer cooperation and coordination Is
desirable, particularly with regard to engineering and planning of capital
installations to achieve a minimm cost network plan. The cost and revenue
sharing agreement between them is also in need of review, which would be
addressed in the proposed tariff structure study.
73.      Action Program - Telecommunicationo Sector.  The Government has
decided to merge the two telephone companies in order to bring about a
speedier improvement in operational efficiencies, such as installation of
new domestic connections, improvements in the spoed of rectification of
technical faults and further training and roassignment of staff. Prior to
second tranche release, the necessary holding company will have been
established. In addition, the Government plans to privatize the sector and
prior to second tranche release, private placement of 102 of the shares
will have been completed.
74.      Jamaica Telephone Company.  JTC is the largest ontity in the
sector and is responsible for domestic service. The Government owns 912 of
shareholding. The overall financial position of the company is weak,



- 27 -
primarily as a result of a four year period (from March 1980 to July 1984)
when rates were not adjusted. Local call and installation charges were
raised by 502 in July 1984. This has improved the situation, with
estimated net income after taxes in 1986 (fiscal year January to December)
of J$160.O million. This compares to a net income of J$23.5 million in
1984, yielding a return of 4.5S on fixed assets employed. The working
capital position of the company is not good. The difficult liquidity
situation is, in part, caused by the large accounts receivable
(approximately J$80.0 million on August 31, 1986), a significant proportion
of which is owed by other parts of the public sector. The JTC's proposed
investment program for 1986 and 1987 is large, with estimated expenditures
of J$112.0 million in FY86/87, up from J$86.2 million and J$31.5 million in
FY84/85 and FY83/84 respectively. From an engineering viewpoint, this is
considered necessary (both exchange installations and the cable networks
are occupied to about 96Z), however, the phasing of the programs could be
lengthened to conform to global fiscal exigencies. With regard to the
tariff structure, past experience has shown that the demand for local
services is price elastic and, at the present time, across the board
increases are not considered appropriate. However, preliminary analysis
suggests that specific adjustments in the structure of rates would be
operationally and financially desirable. Measures to be considered include
initial installation deposits, time and zone differentials in the local
networks and higher fixed installation charges.
75.      Action Program - Jamaica Telephone Comany.  Terms of reference
for an overall tariff study have been completed and the study has been
initiated. This study would be completed by October, 1987 and a revised
tariff structure based on the study and agreeable to the Bank would be
implemented prior to release of the second tranche.
76.      Jamaica International Telecommunications.  JAMINTEL is responsible
for gateway facilities for the various kinds of international
telecommunications traffic. The Government owns 511 of the shareholding,
the remainder owned by a foreign private sector tolecoumunications firm.
The company is in a very strong financial position, with an estimated net
income after taxes for FY86/87 of J$39.0 million. The liquidity position
is also very strong, with a current asset to current liability ratio of 2.5
at the end of FY85/86 and strong additions to working capital over the past
two years. Quality and reliability of service is high, which is downgraded
overall because of the inadequacies of the local networks. The company
contemplates a considerably expanded capital investment program (J$45.7
million in FY86/87 and JS27.1 million in FY87188, as compared to J$7.1
million in FY84/85), which could be financed from internally generated
funds. Some doubt exists as to whether this would be appropriate in the
present fiscal climate and whether the plans are sufficiently coordinated
with JTC's capital programs. Tariffs were adjusted for the first time in
six years in July 1984, when they were increased by 1002. Despite this
adjustment, devaluation of the Jamaica dollar against other foreign
currencies in 1985 has distorted the US$ cost of outgoing calls as compared
to incoming. As a result, a further adjustment in international call rates
of about 50X was made effective as from the 1st of April, 1987.
77.      Action Proaram - Jamaica International Telecommunications.  In
early 1986, the Government imposed a 101 sales tax on both international
and local calls, which is expected to realixe J$24.0 million in FY86/87.



- 28 -
The Cabinet has reviewed JAMINTEL's investment program and has presented to
the Bank a revised budget and financial forecast that reduced the capital
program of JAMINTEL. Prior to second tranche release, international
callZng and correspondent charges would have been reviewed in the context
of the tariff study presently under way, and adjustments satisfactory to
the Bank would be made in line with the recomendations of this study.
78.      Jamaica Broadcastina Corporation.  Jamaica Broadcasting
Corporation operates AM and FM radio stations and the domestic television
service. In the past, the company has not operated profitably, with
profits from the television service being insufficient to cover the losses
of the various AM radio stations. The Government has already initiated a
program to rectify the situation. Over the past year, staff have been
reduced, and the Government has announced plans to lease the AM facilities
to the private sector and also the morning segments of the television
service. The FM station Is to remain a public service, following
operational improvements. In the longer term, it Is envisaged that the
full TV service will be leased to the private sector.
79.      Action Proaram - Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation.  The Government
has completed a detailed timetable for the leasing of the AM transmission
equipment and the morning television segments. Prospectuses have been
prepared, with invitations to tender going out by the end of June 1987.
The Government expects that operations by the lessees will commence by
December 1, 1987. Prior to second tranche release this leasing and
divestiture program would be completed in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank.
Trading
80.      Jamaica Commoditv Trading Comoany.  JCTC is one of the largest
public enterprises in Jamaica, with estimated revenues in the 1985186
fiscal year of J$1.2 billion. The enterprise is solely responsible for the
importation of certain designated items, which include basic foods,
fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, lumber and, since 1984, automobiles. Prior
to 1983, the company had generated modest surpluses and sought to improve
operating efficiencies. However, since 1983 and the declining exchange
value of the J$, the JCTC has encountered severe problems due to
insufficient price adjustment of major commodities. In FY84185,
substantial foreign exchange losses were recorded, resulting in a net loss
of J$97.0 million, compared to a surplus of J$31.0 million in 1982. This
situation was further aggravated in FY85/86, requiring subsidies from the
Central Government of J$148.4 million, in order to cover operating losses
in both fiscal years. In addition, in 1984/85, Government introduced a
food stamp program to assist the neediest parts of the population, at an
annual cost of J$68 million. The situation has not improved in 1986. The
deficit for FY86187 is J$67.0 million, and it should be noted that this
result includes proceeds from the sale of automobiles that were obtained
under a US$42.0 million line of credit. This allotment of motor vehicles
will be entirely sold by the first quarter of FY87/88, with the result that
cross subsidization from this source will not be available in the next
fiscal year. As a result, substantial adjustments in basic commodity
prices will be necessary, the magnitude of which will be dependent upon the
external exchange values of the J$. A mechanism must be created that
allows for automatic adjustment of commodity prices, on a periodic basis,



- 29 -
in conformity to the external exchange value of the J$ in FY87188.
810 Action Proaram - Jamaica Coauoditv Tradina CGMoany. The
Government has agreed that a surplus target of 2.02 of gross soles,
inclusive of direct subsidies no higher than those pertaining In FY86187
(J$80 million) after all expenses (including Interest) should be sought in
FY87/88. To achieve this, there vould be a quarterly review of the surplus
achieved, with appropriate price adjustments, If necessry, to ensure that
the annual target will be met. JCTC would be given discretion on the mix
of product pricing. It would be a condition of second tranche release that
this surplus target is being met, and If not, that prices wmuld be adjusted
in a manner sufficient to realize the surplus target. It should also be
noted that JCTC has already restructured subsidies on powdered milk and
will discontinue the domestic processing of soybean meal. These two
measures above should realize an overall saving of J$33.0 million in
FY87188. Also, prior to release of the second tranche, a wider review of
JCTC's overall pricing policy wuld have been completed, which would
include an assessment of the impact of the policy on overall domestic
agricultural development and determine the most fiscally efficient method
of providing food subsidies to the poorer members of the Jamican society.
Agreement would be reached between the Govornment and the Bank, on the
implementation of the results of this study. Satisfactory terms of
reference for this study have been presented to the Bank (Soe Annex 1I).
Petroleum Sector
82.      Jamaica's energy requirements are supported by imports of oil and
petroleum products, which account for about 402 of total annual imports.
These imports are purchased by the Petroleum Corgoration of Jamaica (PCJ)
with the necessary refinery activity being undertaken by its subsidiary,
Petrolam. In general, the Government policy is to pass the full cost of
oil through to consumers at intermediate and final product stages. A
special fuel subsidy to the electricity utility was abolished in May 1984.
The Petrojam notified price Is indexed to the Venezuelan market price, to
which is then added appropriate local costs and taxes. This price is
quoted in US$. As part of the IM? 1985/86 Stand-by, an Accord Fund was
established, with a maximum targeted annual accrual to this fund of J$100
million, with provision for automatic adjustment of prices should the
three-month moving average of these flows fall below the set minimum of
J$65 million. It should be noted that within the context of tbls pricing
policy and the Accord Fund, there is discretion with regard to the pricing
of the overall product mix. LPG and keroseno prices, for example, contain
an element of cross subsidy from other products. The financial performance
of PCJ is crucially affected by the foreign exchsage valuo of the Jamaican
dollar and a prompt adjustment of domestic pump prices. As tho Accord Fund
is presently established with a maximum and mintmam not flow rate, price
adjustment in an environment of a deprociating Jamaican dollar will occur
in a step-wise fashion, and the magnitude of the adjustment may be quite
severe.   This may not be the most socially desirable method of pump price
adjustment. Another difficulty concerns the levol of subsidy applicable in
the pricing of kerosene and LPG. As it presently stands, these prices are
creating an adverse distortion in the consumption of petroleum products,
with the mixing of kerosene with gasoline, for examplo.
83.     Action Protram - Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica. The Goverument
has approved a more simplified pricing formula for petroleum products, with



- 30 -
a phased elimination of the cross subsidies between products (See Annex
II). Prior to second tranche release, a review of this pricing formula
will be undertaken with full adjustment of product prices being made in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank.
Miscellaneous
84.      Of the three public enterprises targeted in this group, the Urban
Development Corporation (UDC) is the most important in terms of capital
expenditure and the range of its activities. UDC, formed as a statutory
authority in March 1968, was established to give greater impetus to urban
and town development throughout Jamaica. The Corporation's objective was
to serve a more tggressive, catalytic development role In the areas of
housing, urban renewal and infrastructural development in tourist areas.
It undertakes economic and social feasibility studies, compilation of
architectural and ongineoring plans, and project management  In general,
UDC is efficiently managod, with the result that the enterprise is often
asked to undertake functions that were not envisaged lin its original
mandate (for example, development of a fish farming complex In Hellshire).
Over the past five years (FY80181 to FY86187) the Corporation has generated
a modest surplus every year. Its capital expenditure program for FY86187
and FY87188 is ambitious (J$176.3 million and J$215.4 million
respectively), about 402 of which is ongoing, with already established
sources of external funding (IDB). A further 302 Is accounted for by joint
venture construction and development activities in certain tourist areas
with private sector lnvestorIoperators. These have not, as yet, been
identified. Of the romainder, a significant proportion are coumercial
housing and condominium developments which are designed to be self-
liquidating. Within the conte2t of the present fiscal climate, it is clear
that those parts of the Investment program requiring Central Government
loan and grant transfers must be phased over a longer time span.
85.      Action Prosram - Urban Develowment Corporaton. A revised
investment program has been completed, which includes primarily externally
financed projects. This new program reduced the capital expenditures in
FY86187 and FY87188 by J$69.3 million and J$44.4 million respectively. In
addition, UDC's comiercial building activities will be reduced by J$32.0
million in FY87188. No further conditionality for UDC is included in this
operation, however, prior to second tranche release a review will be made
of the investment program to ensure that the agreed targets are being
realixed.
86.      National Hotel and Proyerties.  NHP is a holding company
subsidiary of UDC, designed to oversee the operations of Government owned
hotels. Up to FY83/84, UHF generated substantial operating losses,
however, the Goverrment, over the past few years, has been undertaking a
program to lease all properties owned by W.P As a result of this program,
NHP at present only operates one hotel (the Oceana in Kingston). The
conclusion of these leasing arrangements, together with the general
recovery in tourist arrivals, have lproved NHP's financial performance.
The cash operating balance has turned from a J$33.7 million deficit in
1Y81/82 to a surplus of J$21.1 million in FY85/86 and J$22.0 million in
PY86/87. All lease contracts are denominated in US$, hence devaluations of
the J$ have a positive impact upon revenues, which is partly offset by the
Increased cost of external debt service.



- 31 -
87.     Action Proram - Nat ional Hotels and Pronertieo.  The agreed
budget for FY87188 shove continued improvement, with a targeted cash
surplus of JS8.0 million. As a result, all debt service should be met from
tho enterprise.' resources, with no Central Government transfers necessary.
Further, there would be a phused reduction In the Gove rnmnt loan account
of JS20.0 million during this fiscal year. Satisfactory performmace toward
these budgeted targets would be a second tranch. roloaso condition.
Further, prior to release of the second trancha, a detailed action program
for Hotel Ocoana, that Includes cash flow projections would be completed.
Should these projections indicate, that as a hotel it will be unable to
generate revenue sufficiont to cover operating costs, thean the Government
will taeo action to sell the building.
88.      National Housina Corporation.  NRC constructs low- to medium-
income housing and made a modest surplus of J$0.9 million in FY86187 from a
deficit position of J$2.3 million in FY81182. The present high Interest
rates in the country, and the increaso in construction costs, has reduced
the demand for housing and, as a result, NBC Is slowing down the pace of
its construction In order to avoid an inventory accumulation. Furtiermore,
in response to this trend, the Corporation is expanding its revenue base by
offering a range of professional services, particularly to the Ministry of
Construction. NBC has oncountered liquidity problems due to the large
amount of reetivables owing by the National Housing Trust (stated to be In
excess of J360.0 million), on which no interest Is being accued.
89.     Action Proaram - National HousinA Corooration.  There has been a
reconciliation of all balances outstanding between NBC and the National
Housing Trust. Furthenmore, It haa been agreed with the National Housing
Trust that interest will be charged on any outstanding balances in the
future. Prior to second tranche, a review would be undertaken by the Bank
to ensure that the agreod Interest charges and payments are paid.
PART VI - THE PROPOSED LOAN
Loan History
90.     As noted in paragraph 13 above, the Bank has provided throe
Structural Adjustment Loans since 1982. This has led to an litensive
policy dialogue between GoverAment and the Bank on a broad range of
macroeconomic issues, and the Bank has provided a considerable amount of
import financing to Jamaica during this period of severe economic
difficulties. The progress achieved under the thre SALs was described in
Part II of this report, and the proposed Sector Adjustment Loan reinforces
the reform programs undertaken within these loans   It wsm initially
apprsased in January 1986 and reappraised in August and September, 1986.
Negotiations took place In Washington in April 1987, and the Jamaican
delegation wa led by Dr. Headley Brown, Governor of the Bank of Jamaica.
Loan Dscritit
91.      The proposed loan would consist of two tranches of US$10 mdllion
and would finance a wide variety of general imports, lncluding raw
materials, intermediate good., non-luxury consumer goods, capital equipment
and spare parts, subject only to a negative list of prohibited items.



- 32 -
92.      The matrix in Annex III summarizes the policy actions that were
taken prior to Board presentation and those that will have to be taken
prior to the release of the second tranche. A discussion of these is
contained in Part V, and in the Government's Development Policy Statement
which is included at Annex II.
Disbursement
93.      The first tranche of the loan is expected to be disbursed soon
after loan effectiveness and the second tranche after it has been
determined that the policy actions that have been taken are satisfactory.
Such determination is expected to occur within six months after loan
signature. The Bank of Jamaica, the country's Central Bank, would be
responsible for the coordination and collection of relevant documentation
and preparing withdrawal applications under the loan. Disbursements for
the entire loan are expected to be completed within twelve months of loan
effectiveness.
94.      Because of the financing plan of the present Government
stabilization program, which Includes balance of payments support from
other multilateral and bilateral sources, retroactive financing to January
1, 1987 of the US$10.0 million equivalent first tranche is proposed. To
simplify disbursement, only invoices with a minimum value of US$10,000
equivalent would be eligible for financing. Disbursements would be made
against full documentation, except that for contractsIpurchase orders
valued up to US$50,000 equivalent relating to eligible imports, statements
of expenditure (SOE) would be authorized. The mintmum value for SOEs
submitted would be US$250,000 equivalent, for which the detailed
documentation evidencing expenditures would be retained by the Bank of
Jamaica and made available for the required audit and also inspection by
the Bank.
Procurement
95.      Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for
financing. For all purchases under US$5 million, private firms would
follow normal commercial practice and public sector importers would follow
standard government practices, which ensure reasonable prices. All
purchases exceeding US$5 million would be through international competitive
bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines, except for petroleum imports
which would be acquired through Jamaica's existing advantageous
arrangements.
Records and Auditing
96.      The Bank of Jsmaica would maintain separate records and accounts
of all transactions under the loan. All such accounts would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the auditor's
report would be submitted to the Bank not later than four months after the
end of each Jamaican fiscal year. Audit reports would include a separate
opinion with respect to the disbursement requests submitted to the Bank on
the basis of SOEs and state whether such requests have been effected in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.



- 33 -
Monitoring
97.      The progress of the government reforms in the public enterprise
sector and of the measures supported by the proposed operations would be
closely monitored through regular supervision, including continued close
cooperation with the INF. A specific supervision mission would review
compliance with the conditions for release of the second trsnche.
Risks
98.      The Government's adjustment program faces certain risks.  The pace
of future economic recovery is dependent upon a variety of external factors
beyond the Government's control. Tourism can exhibit significant year to
year volatility. Further, domestic and foreign investor confidence can be
affected by a variety of factors outside of the economic incentive
framework and this could influence the pace of the public enterprise
divestment program and the response of producers to the changing tariff and
trade regime. Finally, much will depend upon the administrative capacity
and commitment of the Government to carry out the adjustment program. In
this latter case the Government has demonstrated a willingness to take
politically difficult economic actions. In so doing, it has continued to
enjoy a significant measure of national support. As a result, the risks
associated with the project are acceptable.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
99.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

President

PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR
ADJUS.ThNT LAN
DEVELOPmENT POLICY STATEMENT
1.       The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) requests tho World Bank (IBRD) to
provide a loan of US$20.0 million as a Public Enterpriso Sector Adjustment
operation In support of the continuig process of reform and efficiency
liprovement of the public enterprise sector In Jamaica, which in turn,
foram part of the overall structural adjustment progrs_e for thc Jamaican
Public Sector Reforns
1.       An Integral goal of the structural adjustment progr_e undertaken
by the GOJ since 1981, ha been to mprove the overall fisca performance
of the public sector and improve further the efficiency of the provision of
government services. In this context there has ben a contractio In the
alsi of Central Government admlnistration, development and implematation
of a tighter planning and management process for p-blic sector lvestment
expenditure and implementation of performance budgeting and improved
financial management system. With regard to the public enterprise sector,
the Government ha directed all public enterprises to pursue financial,
pricing and operational policies which are consistent with financial
viability and the provision of an effictent service to consmrs. The
Government has embarked upon a divestmet progri_e, In which all but one
of tho Government hotels have been leasd to the private sector, a number
of comercial copani-es sold, Including the recent privatlastion of the
country's largest commerclal bank in December, 1986, and roorganviation of
the sugar and banana industries.
2.       A11 these actions have brought about a significant lmprovement in
public sector savings and a reduction In the overall fiscal deficit. The
overall public sector deficit was reduced from 192 of GDP In fiscal year
1981182 about 132 of GODP in fiscal year 1985/86 and given the reforms
undertaken In 1986, some of hich are discussed below, this overall deficit
is expected to decline further to about 6.42 of GDP in fiscal year 1986/87.
Despite this progress made, it Is recognized that considerable scope
remains for further improvements, particularly in the public enterprise
sector to ensure that the need for Central Government budget subsidies has
boen entirely eliminated and surpluses are generated in an amount
sufficient to cover debt service requirements and contribute appropriately
to their respective investment programmes.
Public Enterurise Sector Reform Proaraum_e
3.       From the 1st of January, 1986, the GOJ has selected a target group
of fifteen of the larger public enterprises for specific action programaes
to Improve financial performence and overall operating efficiency. In
addltion, the Government has embarked upon an enhanced divestment
progrome, preparing selected public enterprises for sale or lease to the



ANNEX II
Page 2 of 8
_40 -
private sector. Finally, the Government has embarked upon a programe of
comprehensive reform of the mechanisms available to control and monitor the
performance of all enterprises in the sector. Details of this reform
programme are discussed below.
A. Supervision and Monitoring of Public Enterprises
4.       A variety of individual enterprise reforms has been undertaken
since the start of Jamaica's structural adjustment prograsme in 1981. As a
group, these reforms have contributed to an improvement In overall public
sector fiscal performance and reduced credit demands on the banking system.
In 1980181 these enterprises as a whole, including the National Insurance
Fund generated internal surpluses of J$154 million or 2.92 of the GDP as
their contribution to their Capital expenditure and debt service. In
1986187 the internal surplus of the group is projected at $1393 million to
fund a capital programme of $1124 million and leave a surplus of $270
million. They do not, however, address the more fundamental, sector wide
problems of public enterprises in Jamaica. In many instances, individual
firm finacial difficulties are a manifestation of much deeper structural
problems in the economy. In particular, the rapid growth and diversity of
Government's role in the economy has placed demands upon the central
administration that have been difficult to meet. The Ministry of Financo
and Planning In particular, has found it difficult to maintain adequate
control of necessary monitoring due, in part, to a laek of suitably
qualified staff, but also to the lack of a clearly defined system and
procedure for this financial control function. The past proliferation of
statutory boards and public enterprises has often resulted in public
entities with unclear organization policy guidelines with the result that
effective financial control has been difficult. A Financial Management
Reform Task Force was established under the Administrative Reform
Programme, in August 1984, and while deliberations are continuing,
preliminary findings suggest, besides specific inadequacies of individual
enterprises, that overall public sector financial management is not
sufficient to ensure enforcement of performance requirements,
accountability and appropriate planning and progress reporting among the
enterprises.
5.       In part, these difficulties are a manifestation of the legal
framework under which the enterprises operate. Some operate under
Jamaica's Companies Act, others under specific enabling legislation, with
the result that there is a great diversity in reporting requirements.
Therefore, in early 1986, the GOJ, with assistance from the International
Centre for Public Enterprises in Developing Countries, undertook a review
of the whole concept of inter-relationships between the Public Enterprises
and agencies of Government, to examine the present practice of supervision,
control and evaluation exercised by such agencies over Public Enterprises.
This review was completed in June 1986, and concluded that it would be
desirable in the Jamaican context, to initiate a Public Enterprises Act.
In furtherance of this, the GOJ has approved the issuance of drafting
instructions to the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, based upon the outlines
shown in Attachment 2 of this letter in December 1986. This Public
Enterprises legislation has been included in the Legislation Programme of
the Government for fiscal year 1987/88.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 8
-41* -
6.       In addition to reforms in the legislative environment surrounding
the public enterprise sector, the GOJ has improved the resources av liable
to the Public Enterprisoes Division of the Ministry of Finance, Including
appointment of a Deputy Financial Secretary to facilitate the overall
monitoring capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Planing.
7.       Fiaally, in order to improve further the information base
available for Central Government monitoring, the GOJ, through the Committee
for Public Accountability, and with assistance from local audit firms, vill
compile an inventory of the assets and liabilities of Public Enterprises as
of March 31, 1986. The terms of reference of this financial survey are
shown in Attacbment 3, ond the study will be completed by October, 1987.
Following completion of this inventory, the Government will prepare an
action plan with a view for these enterprises to Improve efficiency,
through, inter alia, managerial and/or financial restructuring, disposal of
ssets, divestment or liquidation.
B. DIvestment of Public Enterprises
8.       The GOJ has embarked upon a comprehensive privatisation of
appropriato public enterprises, utilizing a Technical Secretariat within
the National Investment Bank of Jamaica and a Divestment Committee which
identifies the most effective means of privatisation, conducts negotiations
and submits to the Cabinet appropriate reco _endations. By December, 1985,
the Cabinet had approved for privatisation forty-five entities of which 18
have either been sold or leased by December, 1986. Of particular note was
the sale of 51S of the shares of the National Comercial Bank (MCB) by
public subscription. This share offer which was completed in December 1986
was oversubscribed by 1751, with just over 30,000 applications. This Is
the largest number of persons to have supported a share issue in J_maica,
extending the number of shareholders of Companies listed on the Stock
Exchange from 3,000 to 33,000 and has contributed to a revitalization of
the local Stock Exchange. The sale of the remainig 492 of NCB is expected
to be completed this year. During the fiscal year 1987188, it is expected
that 20 enterprises will be divested subject to the satisfactory conclusion
of negotiations that are presently underway, and that a minI:mm of J$150.0
million of assets will have been divested by December 1987.
C. Intergovernmental Arrears
9.       As noted earlier, the GOJ has embarked upon a major reform of the
financial budgeting and control systems in the public sector. In the past,
budget allocations for some public entities have not been sufficient to
meet charges from other governmental bodies, particularly utilities, with
the result that arrears have accumulated between them. Since April 1986,
budgeting and control procedures have been substantially revised, and
special provisions have been made to progressively eliminate accumulated
arrears. Within the targeted group of enterprises the following provisions
have been made 
(i) with effect from April, 1986, a schedule for elimination of Air
Jamaica landing fee arrears to the Airports Aut.orlty has been
drawn up. This involves the payment of J$230,. (15.00 per month
by Air Jamaica to the Airports Authority, over a period of 48
months;



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 8
- 42- -
(ii) with effect from the 1st April, 1987, a schedule for
elimination of all arrears owing by the various government
ministries and departments to the National Water Commission
(NWC) has been drawn up. This involves the payment of J$2.104
million per month, over a period of 24 months.
Finally, procedures have been put in place to ensure that all government
ministries and departments remain current in monthly billings by NC, the
Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSCo), the Jamaica Tolephone Company (JTC)
and Jamaica International Communications (JAMINTEL).
D. Specific Public Enterprise Actions
10.     Air Jamaica.  A complete review of the airline's route structuro
has been completed, which has resulted in adjustments to time schedules and
termination of the Jamaica to Haiti route. In order to improve the
enterprise's liquidity, the Ministry of Finance and Planning has granted
permission for Air Jamaica to initiate discussions to renegotiate the
leases on its videbody jet aircraft with a view to lengthening the lease
period. It is expected that these reneg tiations will be completed by the
end of December 1987. In addition, for L.he fiscal year 1987188, Air
Jamaica has reduced its proposed inves. aent in transportation equipment by
an amount equivalent to J$22.0 million. Finally, the GOJ will seek to
transform Trans Jamaican Airlines (Transjam) into a profitable company by
December, 1987, with a view to subsequent privatization.
11.     Airports Authority.  In order to improve the financial viability
of this Authority, the airport departure tax was raised from J$20 to J$40
per passenger with effect from the 1st January, 1986. This departure tax
will be reviewed periodically. In addition, during 1986, the GOJ undertook
a restructuring of the Airports Authority's capital base. This involved a
conversion of J$54.6 million of GOJ debt into equity, and consolidation of
the remaining J$53.6 million into a specific loan at 82 interest per annum,
with a 5-year grace period and a 20 year repayment period. Interest is to
be capitalized during the grace period. The effective date for these
conversions is 24th June, 1986 These measures described above, together
with the planned elimination of landing fee arrears owing to the Airports
Authority, have greatly improved the enterprises' financial viability and
future prospects.
12.     Port Authority.  A review of the Port Authority's pricing
structure and investment programme has been completed. In fiscal year
1986187, provision was made for the Port Authority to pay corporate taxes
and import duties which are projected to realize about J$15.0 million.
Throughout fiscal year 1987188, a periodic review will be made of the Port
Authority to ensure that the taxation targets are being met, and that the
revised investment programme is being adhered to.
13.     Jamaica Merchant Marine. The financial position of the Jamaica
Merchant Marine (JMM) is precarious and the GOJ has undertaken to
thoroughly review this entity's operations. By November 1987, the
Government would have completed, and the Cabinet approved, a national
shipping policy paper. This study would address all the options available
for ensuring the shipment of Jamaica's imports and exports by the cheapest



ANMEX II
Page 5 of 8
and most efficient means. In addition, this study would delineate the
options availablo to restore financial viability to JMf, such that a
decision may be reached as to the enterprise's future existence. In the
interim a laid up ship was disposed of in 1986.
14.      Jamaica Railway Corporation.  Prior to 1984, the financial
viability of the Jamaica Railway Corporation (JRC) bad been continually
eroded, particularly given the declining levels of bauxite production.
Operating losses have been large, requiring periodic Contral Government
transfers to enable the Corporation to remain financially solvent. In
1984, efforts to Improve efficiency were undertaken, which included cutting
staff by over 402 and increasing passenger fares by 362. Despite these
measures the financial position of JRC was far from secure, and the GOJ
undertook a review of policy options for continued operation, which was
submitted to Cabinet in March, 1986. It was decided to continue with
operations, following a management reorganization and employment of a new
general manager and a new marketing manager; a renegotiation of the bauxite
carriage charges which raised rates by about 1402 over those pertaining in
1984; institution of a voluntary redundancy programme and Central
Government assumption of all JRC's existing commercial bank overdrafts.
These measures have improved JRC's viability, however the GOJ will
undertake a regular, quarterly review of financial results to ensure that
the planned Improvement in financial performance in fiscal year 1987/88 is
being realized.
15.     Jamaica Telephone Company. The Government has continually sought
to Improve the financial strength and the operational efficiency of the
provision of domestic telephone services in Jamaica. In July 1984, local
call and installation charges were raise4 by 502, and the investment
programme has sought to expand and upgrade the country's telephone network.
A further rate adjustment of 552 on overseas calls has taken effect from 1
April, 1987. In addition, preliminary analysis suggests that specific
adjustments in the structure of rates would also be operationally and
financially desirable. Therefore, the GOJ is to undertake vith the
assistance of appropriate consultants, an overall tariff study that would
focus upon the entire tariff structure (the terms of reference of which are
shown in Attachment 3). This study will comuence by July 1987, and should
be completed by November 1987. Following review of this study's
recommendations, the Jamaica Telephone Company (JTC) will introduce a
revised tariff structure.
16.      Jamaica International Telecommunications.  As with JTC above,
Jamaica International Telecommunications (JAHINTEL) rates were adjusted in
July 1984, and in April 1987. In addition, the tariff study discussed in
paragraph 16 above, will review the adequacy of international calling and
correspondent charges. Based upon the conclusions of this study presented
by November 1987, these charges will be adjusted where appropriate. The
GOJ has decided to create a holding company that would merge the two
telecommunications companies. By December 1987, this holding company will
have been formed, with a private placement of about 102 of its shares.
17.      Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation.  In the past, the Jamaica
Broadcasting Corporation (JBC) has not operated profitably, with profits
from the television service being insufficient to cover the losses of the



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8
-44 -
various AM rsdlo stations. The Government has already initiated a program
to rectify the situation. In 1986, st-ff had been reduced, end tho
Government has announced plans to lease the AN facilitlee to the private
sector end lso* the morning segments of the television sorvice. The
Government of Jamaica has prepared a timetable for the leasing of the AM
facilities. In the case of JBC TV the proposal now ts to divest Its
commercial operations. Divestment will be by way of sale of license to a
private sector entity to operate a privato TV station. A portion of JBC*s
present TV equipment will be loosed to this privato entity. The
substantially scaled down JBC TV will be trwanformed Into a purely
educational channel.  Preparation of prospectus  nd Invitation to tender
should be completed by the end of September 1987.
18.      Jamaica Commodity Tradina Com,any. The Jamaica Comodity Trading
Company (JCTC) is one of the larger public enterprises in Jmaieca, and ls
sololy responsible for the Importation of certain basic foodstuffs, pharmac
eutlcals, and since 1984, automobiles. This enterprise has boen utilized
a. a vehiele for subsidizing basic foodstuffs, either through cross
subsidization between products imported or by direct Central Government
subvention. For FY87188, the GOJ has set a surplus target for JCTC
equivalent to 22 of gross sales, inclusive of direct subsidies no higher
thma those pertaining in PY86187, after all expenses (including interest).
JCTC's financial performance will be reviewed on a quarterly basls to
ensure that this annual target will be met, with appropriato commodity
price adjustments, If necessary. In addition, JCTC has already
restructured subsidies on powdered milk and will discontinue domestic
processing of soyabean meal. These two measures alone should reallse an
overall saving of J$33.0 million in FY87188. Also the GOJ is to undertake
a wtder review of JCTC's overall pricing policy, which would Include an
assessment of the Impact of this policy on overall domestic agricultural
development and determine the most fiscally efficient method of providing
food eubsidies to the poorer members of the Jamaican society. The terms of
roterence for this roview are shown in Attachment 4, and the study will be
complated by November 1987.
19.      Jamadca Public Service Comoany.  This electricity generating
public enterprise has made substantial progress In the quality and
efficiency of servico. Furthermore, there has been a steady improvement in
finapc$al performance, with an estimated operating balanc of about J$195.0
million in FY86187 comparod to J$2 3 million In FY81J82. To further
consolidate on this progress, the GOJ, with assistance frop external
consultants, undertook a tariff study, vhich wa completed in t.y 1986.
20.      Petroleum Coruoration of Jamaica.  This public enterprise is the
sole tmporter of oil and petroloum products, and through its subsidiary
Petrpjam, undortakes the necessary refinery activity. It is Government's
poll¢y to pass the full cost of oil through to consumers at intermediate
and final product stages, and In this context a special fuel subsidy to the
electricity utility was abolished in May 1984. In addition, the Government
has approved a more simplified pricing formula for petroleum products, with
a phased elimination of the cross subsidies between products. Details of
this pricing policy are shown In Attachment S.
21.      National Wator Commisson. The GOJ has undertaken a major program
to consolidate the country's water supply services Into one entity, and to



ANNU II
aje 7 - of 8
ensure the financial viability of this public enterprise. As part of this
consolidation process, tho water prowlsion services of tbe parish cou;ncll
have been subsumed into the National Vater Coommision (NMC) management has
been reorgeanied and redundant staff have been laid off whetr appropriate.
On lst January, 1986, water tariffs were ralod by 881 to *nsure NNC'
financial solvency. To further consolidate on these reforms, the GJ has
agreed that NWC water tariffs will be adjusted where necessary on a semd-an
nual basis as from April 1987, with the slse of the adjustment to be
determined by an lndex of the change of prices of the enterprise's major
inputs. The first roview of this new price adjustmnt system will be
September 1987. In addition, NWC's liquidity problem have been lessened
by the schedule of arrears elfinlation outlined in paragraph 10 above, and
the Goverrment's comitment that all Government  Minstrios and departments
remain current In monthly billings by all public enterprise utiltltes.
Finally, the GOJ will review the salary structure of the higher management
and technical staff of the MC, and make appropriate adjustment tn order
that this structure conform more closely to the salary scales in other
public enterprises.
22.      Urban Develogment Corporation. The GOJ recognises that in the
context of the present fiscal climate, the large investment progrem of this
public enterprise will havo to be extended over a longer time frame. As
such a revised investment program has bean completed, which icludes
primarily externally financed projects, and the entity's commercial
building ctivitieos will be reduced by J$32.0 million in FY87188.
23.      National Hotels and Proierties.  Following the successful program
of leasing of Government hotel properties, the financlal performance of
this enterprise has Improved from a cash operating deficit of J$24.5
million in PY81182 to a surplus of about J$32.0 million in 1Y86187. This
performance Is expected to be maintained In FY87/88, with the result that
no Central Government transfers will be necessary, and that there will be
a phased reduction In the Government loan account of J$20.0 million durint
this fiscal year.  In additlon, by October 1987, National Rotels and
Properties will present to the Government a detailed action program for
Hotel Oceana, that includes cash flow projections. Should these cash flow
projections indicate that as a hotol it will bo unable to generate revenue
sufficient to cover operating costs, then the Government will take action
to either privatise or put to alternative use.
24.      National Rousint Corporation.  In order to overcome the liquidity
problems encountered by the National Rousing Corporation (NBC), the
Government has reconciled all balances owing by the National Housing Trust
to NRC. Furthermore, It has beon agreed with NBC, that Interest will be
charged on any outstanding balances In the future.
25.      This program of policy reforms embarked upon since January 1986 is
designed to both facilitate the GOJ's drive to reduce the overall fiseal
deficit end have a lasting Impact upon the public enterprise sector's
financial performnce. This reform effort is fully consistent with the
overall thrust of the GOJ's Structural Adjustment Program, and It io
expected that the momentum of reform In the public enterprise sector will
continue throughout the life of Jmaica's Structural Adjustment efforts.
In view of the measures already taken, and those planned throughout 1987,
the 600 would appreciate your favourable consideration of its request for a

The ncrporation of entities deemd to be Public      prises
2.         Udier this principle the Legislation will provide for the definition
of Public literprises.  mbis will relate to those entities which are owed and
controlled by the Goenment and which the Minister of Finance by Order declares
to be Public    rises   r  the Act. Wtere such an Order is made this Duld
muw  that suuh an entity must be i    red  under the Public  erprises Act.
3.         The Act should then provide ir a model form of mmwwarKtw  and
assoXsaticn or objects and functions and details pertaining to the Board, the
Office of the Public Eterprise, their reSpibilitiLa. apxXintet. r0wal
etc. It will also be necessary to provide for the capitalisation of each entity
declared to be a Public Enterprise and the vesting of all its shares in the
Acoauntat General. It will also be necessary for the Act to provide for the
Miniter t^- be aepowered to make a vesting Order under the Act vesting all the
assets and liabilities of the entity in Utk newly  c  red  Public Enterprise.

caanies previously incorporated under the Crmpanies Act subject to the
saving of its assets and liabilities bieng vested in th- new Public Enterprise
as pointed out above and with an appropriate declaration which maintains the
rights of all enitities against the new Public Eiterprise created in succession
to the old entity (which wtuld have been either a company under the CXaianies
Act or statutory oDrporation under its separate Act of Parlia   t). lhius the
new incorpoation under the Public Enterprises Act wust also be capable (in
addition to the wind-up arrangfsnnts under the C:mpanies Act as indicated above)
of effecting a repeal of the appropriate Statutory Corporation Act under which
the entity as previously existing was in     rated.
4.         On policy grounds it would be as_umed that incorporation under the
Public Enterprises Act would only apply to those entities which it was decided
would remain penvanently under Government ownership and oontrol within the
Public Sector. Hawever, since policy may change fram time to time  i, would
be necessary to provide under the Act for the reversal of such a position and
thus either for the outright liquidation or winding-up of a Public Enterprise
under the Act and/or its reincorporation under the Ccyparies Act or by separate
Act of Parlianxt with the appropriate VMr-tinrj Orders in rclation to existing
claims on the assets and liabilities of such an entity. Accordingly, what is
envisaged as existing as Goverrmunt entities would be those entities incorporated
-under the proposed Public Enterprises Act, along with those other Govecrnnntal
entities not brought under the Act and therefore continuing to exist under the
C3mpanies Act or as separate oorporations under Act of Parliament.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR RATES 4 TARIFFS STUDY
A.   BACKGROUND
The Jamaica Telephone Company has the sole responsibility for public
telecomunication services vithin Jamaica, and joint responsibility
vith JAMINTEL for international services from within Jamaica to
overseas.
Revenue from the provision of these services currently fall under the
following main areas:
1)      Telephone local calls
2)      Telephone toll calls
3)      Telephone international calls
4)      Telex local calls
3)      Telex international calls
6)      Subscriber lines
7)      Customer equipment
8)      Private wire
9)      Data circuits (leased)
10)      Packet Switched Data Usage (Local and international)*
B.   JTC'S POLICY RE RATES & TARIFFS
The philosophy of the Company is that consistent with other utilities, the
objectives of any pricing mechanism to be Instituted in the telephone
industry should achieve the following:
(i)     Optimisation of efficiency in the usage of the System:
Since telephone plant requirements are based on peak hour traffic,
to achieve optimisation in the usage of the system, the method of
pricing should be such that peaks are shaved and valleys filled.
This evening out of excessive peaks will enable expensive plant to
be used more efficiently and so ensure maximum usage per plant
investment.
(ii)    Create Equitable rates:
Building to a peak which cannot be controlled or influenced by
pricing, results in extra costs on the whole system. However,
basic fairness suggests that those who contribute to those costs
should be made to pay. Ideally, this should be achleved by
* To he 4ntroduced during 1986.



-71 -
making the rates for each type of service pay for the cost of
providing the service and provide the required return. Hovever,
It may be difficult to achieve this In all cases, since a soervice
may be deesed essential but cost cannot be covered without high
charges to the customers. Therefore, the rates may have to be
set low and a part of the cost recovered through higher rates for
other services.
(1ii)   Consistent with (i) and (ii) above, the Company is committed to
the following pricing strategies:
(a)    'Local' Call charges should be usage sensitive and dependent
on 'Time'.( It is planned to introduce Local Message Metering
In Kingston during 1936).
(b)    'Toll' and 'International' call charges should be usage
sensitive and dependent on 'Distance' and 'Time'.
'Time' in the above includes both 'Duration' and 'Time of Day'.
(iv)    Provide a reasonable return on Investment:
It is essential that to remain bouyant the Company should make a
reasonable return on Investment.
C.    THE "TERMS OF REFERENCE"
Based on the guidelines outlined in A and B above, the 'Terms of Reference'
for the Rates and Studies are as follows:
1.      To analyse all relevant data, and develop analytical techniques
for computing tariffs for the various revenue centres identified
in A, i.e.
a)     Techniques for deriving tariffs for Custom Equipment
b)          n         n       n    n         Line Changes
c)          n       n      n       n     n  Local Usage (Telephone)
d)          n         n       n    n        Toll usage (Telephone)
e)          n         n       n    n         International usage (Telephone)
f)          n       n      n       n        Local usage (Telex)
g)          "                                I n  n  n  lnternational usage (Telex)
b)          n              " n           "  Private Wire Charges
1)          "       n      ,       n     n  Data Circuits (leased)
j)          n       n              " n       Packet Switched Data
usage (local and international)

2.      Where there is a revenue sharing between J.T.C and JAMINTEL for
overseas services, a recommeided technique for division of
revenue is required.
3.      Where such rates are sensitive fluctuation in exchange rates
(J$ vs US$), recommendations for dealing with this is required.

MBmIH96s RoR cOPINu WInl PomTY IN TM
JMICAN 
Cabinet has approved a Study, to be carried out under the auspices
of the Planming Institute of Jamaica, aimed at examining the food staup and
generalised subsidy programne currently in place, with a view to making
transparent the strengths and weaknesses, the extent of coverage, prmbl
of inpleentation and the eoocmiic costs of the prograne both direct and
indirect. Ihe Study shall, in addition, examine other possible incrme
support mechaniss and shall evaluate then in light of:
i)  the high umniploaent levels existing;
ii) the relatively low family inr=s for families in
Jamaica, inclusive of the critically and nmarginally
poor, as well as aspiring lower middle income
families;
iii) the desirability of raising the level of food self
sufficiency and inptoved delivery of health
(nutrition) education and social welfare services
particularly to the lawest groups of the inoome
distribution.
r3D~!1VBS OF THFE STUDY
2.       7he Study shall -
i) evaluate the inpact of the food staup progranm in
light of the price escalations since its inception;
ii) evaluate the inpdimnts experien  with resect
to the food stanp programe;
iii) evaluate the cost of the programme in tenns of
camestic production foregae;
iv) evaluate the nutritional benefits of the progrem
in tenns of calorie content and protein content per
dollar of expenditure on local and basic foods
inclusive of the food staw items;
../2



- 74 -
v) exmine and report on the fimctinin  of the
current subsidy programes, indicating tle extet
of the subsidy in aggregate and in individual scbos.
This examination should indicate the price inpact that
wwvld follow the removl, phased or otherwise, of the
arrent subsidy and how this wuld further affect the
critically and the marginally poor and aspiring lower
middle inc    families;
vi) examnine other rachnisms for providing inoao  support
or poverty alleviation. In this connection those
mechanians should be discussed with specific reference
to the experienoe in other thrd world ountries, in
addition to trends and issues currently aerging in the
developed countries with respect to these mnhnis
vii) examine and evaluate Goverruent's basic foods pricing
policies in light of the Goverrment's desire to
encourage caiestic agriculture and to irease the
country's food self sufficieny;
viii)  make reerdaticns, in the light of the above
analysis, for more effective targettig of food
subsidy progranme. mhese ribns should
present the array of optios that might be available
and make an assessment of the fiscal costs of each
option, cupared to the ooverage of the food subsidy
progra,re.

PETROLEUM PRICING STRUCTURE
The pricing structure for petroleum products is build up from a
number of components involving the refinery billing price and trade
margins. Refinery 'illing price includes the es-refinery price, tax and
subsidy.
Subsidy no longer exist for LPG and in the case of kerosene, a
marginal subsidy is placed on domestic kerosene used by the very poor in
the rural areas.
The refinery price is set by Government and Is based on regional
market prices which are published in a daily bulletin known as Platts
oilgram. This bulletin quotes prices for petroleum products by regional
exportsl Trintoc in Trinidad, Shell and Texaco Traders and PDVSA
Venezuela. The average of these prices for each product is taken as the
Caribbean Panty Price for the refinery, provided this average is not too
significantly different from market price in the U.S. Gulf. These spot
market prices are used to adjust downward the Caribbean parity in those
instances where the spot market is more reflective of the regional prices.
To the ex-refinery price is added the cost of transporting the product,
terminalling fee and cost of distributing the product to the marketing
companies.
The principle behind the setting of the refinery price is that
product prices at this level should cost no more than had they been
imported.

Trade margins consists of marketers margin, haulage contractors
margin and retail margin. These margins are set by government for all
controlled products. Adjustments which may be necessary from time to time
are based on the need to provide the industry a return on
revalued/depreciated assets and capital employed.
In each sector of the trade, adjustments are made ors the basis of
computing an average whicE is derived from data submitted to government by
each company comprising the particular sector.
