pxbi-ctivsn
D-ccr1R&1on3      The main objective. of the project are: (a) to finance a
program of small municipal works ln the area of urban
infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation; (b) to promote
local private contractors and consulting firms in project
execution; (c) to improve, through execution of the works
financed by the project, the individual skills of the
workers to be employed and the corporate competitiveness of
the firms that will carry out works so as to develop their
capacity to respend to increased opportunities for
sustained employment after completion of the project; (d)
to create, at least temporarily, substantial new employment
in urban areas as rapidly as possLble using the private
sector; (e) to review existing public worcs management
ocedures and recast them with the intent of speeding up
threr implementation and overall performance; and (f) to
demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects and
test the procedures that will enable the public sector to
commision such projects.
The componerts of the proposed project ares (a) a program
of public facility and infrastructure rehabilltation and
maintenance in urban areas to be carried out under
labor-intensive schemes by local contractors; (b) a package
of services related to work organization, management, and
labor force traLning to be offered on a voluntary basis to
the local contractors who will be awarded contracts under
component (a); (c) a supervlison and monitoring component
in order to closely monitor the progress of the project and
to  prepare  the  transition  toward  locallY  supported
wnployment of the target grouP; (d) a selective audit of
public works programs to identify bottlenecks and design
system improvements  and  (e)  a package of consultant
services related to a training program 'or the
beneficiaries and engineering flrms on ths preparation of
feasibility studies 4nd tachnical project proposals, and a
program aimed at increasing grassroots participation ln
urban Lnfrastructure maintenance.
The main criterLa for subproject eligibility are: (a) the
subproject should have a proven economic and social utility
(i.e., for economic subprojects, the rate of return shall
be no lus than that whlch is applied to the Public
Investment Program and for social projects (schools,



- iLL -
elinics, etc.) th- project shall be the least-cost
0olutLon I, and be ra dy for executlon without reruirLng
substantLal detalled *ngineerLngg (b) the subproject
lrplementatlon should not roquire the use of sophLstieated
equip mnt and should be achLevable through labor-Lntenslve
methods (i.e., wtth labor, as a percentage of the total
coat, amounting to at least 20 peroent); (c) preference
will be given to those subprojects whiLe are likely to
Lmprove the skills of the workers Lnvolved and/or expose
the contractor to an experience that would give him an
advantage for future activities; (d) the subproject must
fall wLthin the list of eligible "worka" or "services"
activitles established by the Agency. Xn order to assure a
primary  focus on urban  asset rehabilitation,  lt was
necossary to split the allocation of funds between works
and services based on a 60/40 ratio.  Such a mechanism
would protect the majority of project funds from being
spent on menLal service activities that do not contrlbute
to buLlding the skilas of the local constructLon industry
firms. The Agency will submit for IDAIs a roval, prior to
effectiveness, a -list of subprojects for the first year of
preject execution amc nting to a total of US$4.78 million.
Also, the Agency will submlt for IDA's approval a second
and a third batch of subprojects totalling US$4.78 million
each no later than September 15, 1992 and September 15,
1993 respectively. Su projecto whose eatimated cost will
exceed CFAF 100 million (US$400,000 wlll be subject to
IDA's review and approval prior to final selectlon by the
Executing Agency.
Ju4tiftiption
and Rinkst        The project will assist municipalities and "collectivit6s
localeo" to carry out useful investments in the
rehabLlitation and maintenance of public infrastructure.
it will help the private sector, especially the small firms
in construction-related industries that will be engaged to
execute the works.   It will create employment as these
firms will hire laborers and technicians to fulfill thelr
contracts.   It will promote the local engineerLng and
archltectural consulting industry whlch will provLde
subproject deaign and supervision servicee. The project
wil1 also help the Government in the area of contract
management. It will demonstrate the efflicency of prLvate
sector  approaches  and  procedures  in  public  works
management. The ultimate direct beneficiaries wlll be the
low-paid temporary workers in the buildlng and constructlon
trades.
The maln risks arise from the poseible inability of Burklna
Faso's economy to develop enough stable job opportunities
at the and of the project perLod, leading to pressure froc
the Government to extend the project beyond its inLtLal
three years.  This risk cannot be addressed withln the
proposed project but should be alleviated lf the ongolng
adiustment program li Lmplemented successfully. The rLsk
will also be reduced by the development of stable
infrastructure maintenance programs that are being
developed under Bank-supported urban and transport
projects. Another risk ls that there might be pressure for
contlnued employment for those who would beneflt from the
program to take the form of their being hLred by local
govrnm nts when the program ends.  Such contlnuation of
employment would jeopardiLz efforts of publlc sector
management improvement, lncludlng restrLctions on personnel
hlring, implemented during the recent years by the central
and local governments. Lastly, the control of proper use of



- iv -
funds is more difficult with such a program than wlth
regular lnvestment projects. The LmplementLng arrangments
established during projiot preparatLon and appraisal and
contained  ln a Proesdures Manual  (Anasx 2),  whlch ls
attached to the Conventlon entered Lnto by the Government
and the Agency, have been carefully deuigned to addmass
this rLsk. As a result, project selectlon wlll be carried
out accordlng to economlc crlteria and approved by the
Assoclatlon.    PLnarcLal  management  wlll  be  closely
monltored through sLA-monithly audlts of the Agency's
operations.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPOET
I   THE ECONOMIC AND SQCIAL CONTEXT
A.  Recession. Unemoloymen,. and Urbaniz tio
1.01     Burkina Faso's record for the decade of the 1980. is one of
upheavals.  The country has known two coupo d'itat and one attempted coup
in that decade.  The socio-political unrast, couplad with drought, rainfall
fluctuations, and the fall in world market prices for it. main agricultural
export commodities (cotton and groundnut oil have contributed to neduce
its competitiveness. For example, between 1972 and 1989, Burkina Faso saw
a 50 percent decline in its terms of trade.
1.02     A detGriocat;.ng public finance situation ensued as political
turbulence created constraints, making it difficult to reduce domestic
demand. The 3 7 percent real annual growth rate of GDP reached between
1986 and 1990 has not been translated into real investments. Budgetary
discipline has not been obserasd and scarce resources have been used for
non-budgeted outlays. From 1986 to 1990, consumption grew at almost the
same rate as GDP and domestic savings remained at a level equivalent to
3.8 percent of GDP in 1990. As a result, foreign aid has financed an
average of 84 percent of total government outlays.
1.03     In the meantime, Burkina Faso'o economic structure underwent some
changes during the 1980s, indicating the diminution of agriculture and the
rise of ser%ices.  In 1980, agriculture contributed 39.9 percent to GDP
while industry and services contributed 18.8 percent and 36.4 percent
respectively.  In 1990, it has been estimated that agriculture constituted
30 percent of GDP while industry and services contributed respectively
23 and 42 percent. Also, the financial crisis has reduced investments in
urban areas while the diminishing contribution of agricul.ture has
reinforced rural-urban migration. With higher population growth and a
small modern sector, the social effects of the crisis have been the most
visible at the urban level.
1.04     According to the last population census of 1985  Burkina Faso has
a population of 8.3 million representing an average density of 30 persons
Per square kilometer as compared to 20 in 1975.  It has been estimated that
by the year 2000, Burkina Faso will have a population of 12 million. The
population of Burkina Faso is very young. Forty-five percent is less than
45 years old, 52 percent is between 15 anl 64 years old and 3 percent is
over 65 years old. The bulk of the labor force, estimated at about 3.8
million, works in agriculture (82 percent), industry (13 percent), and
services (5 percent). In the past 30 years (1960-1990), there has been a
small increase in birth rates (from 49 to 51 percent), a marked decrease in
death rates (from 32 to 19 percent), and an increase in life expectancy
(from 32 to 48 years). Theae figures highlight the demographic forces at
work that have led to serious tensions in the labor market.  Intensive
scrutiny further reveals that the most important dimension of this
demographic trend is the fact that youth mortality has been reduced by a
factor of 2.5 in the past 30 years (from 225 to 98).
1.05     The modern sector in Burkina Faso employs only a fraction of the
labor force. The majority works in the informal sector which contributes
about two-thirds of the value added in commerce, transportation, and
communications, and about 40 percent in the industrial sector. The average
informal sector worker corresponds to the age structure of the population.
He/he is young and has little education. According to the 1987 survey
done by the Office National de la Promotion do l'Emploi (ONPE) in
Ouagadougou, 60 percent of these workers are between 20 and 40 years old.
Eighty percent of informal sector workers are illiterate, 15 percent have
completed primary school, and 3.7 percent have completed secondary school.



2-
Eighty-two percent doclared themselves *elf-empioyed, a percent are ln an
apprenticeship program, and 4 percent are employers.  There exists a great
deal of labor mobility ir the informal *sotor but the group of *employers"
is made up of those who declared that they have been working for mnre than
five years in their preosnt activity.
1 .)6    A high population growth rate of 3.3 percent and lntonse rural-
urban mlgration have dramatlcally increased urbanization in the 1980s. The
capital city, Ouagadougou, which had a small population of 276,000 in 1980,
has more than doubled in population, reaching 600,000 in 1990. This
population represents 40 percent of the urban population. Bobo-Dioulasso,
the other large urban agglomeration, accounts for another 25 Percent of the
urban population and has seen its population increaae to 300,000 since
1980.  Th  labor force growth of these urban areas has not been matchetd by
job creation. For a long time, the traditional outlet for the youngest
strata of the urban population has been emigratlon to neighboring COt-
d'IvoLr- and Ghana.  These workers sent remittances equalling 6 perient of
GDP for the 1986-1990 period.
1.07      Despite the development of the formal sector since 1960, the
informal sector continues to contribute 80 percent of  he growth of the
secondary and tertiary sectors to GDP. Micro-enterprises play an important
role in that sector where employment creation is taking place. Howev- -,
despite its importance, both in terms of contribution to growth and
employment, the Go; ernment has pursued a policy of subsidy to large lmport
substitution industries and of relative neglect toward the informal sector.
The Investment Code favors new and capital intensive industries and gives
them all kinds of incentives ranging from tax holidays on imports of raw
materials to abatement on profit for five years.
1.08     The unemployment situation in th'e urban areas of Burkina Faso is
very acute. The two traditional outlets for demand of labor (secondary
private sector and public sector) are unable to satisfy the flow of new
entrants to the labor market.  The modern sector of light industries is not
labor-intensive and does not create many jobs, while th  public sector is
saturated. According to a survey of the labor markets in the three largest
cities (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, and Koudougou), carried out by ONPE in
1987, there were 31,974 demands for only 5,470 offers or a coverage ratio
of demand to supply of 17 percent. The situation was worse in Ouagadougou
where for a total of 22,147 demandv there were only 3,288 offers, or a
coverage ratio of 14.8 percent. Since then, things have worsened due to
intense rural-urban migration. The ONPE survey indicates that compared to a
total of 50,089 informal sector workers identified in Ouagadougou, there
were only 28,000 civil service employees, while the modern private sector
had 23,570 employees.
1.09     Urban unemployment has been rising, especially as the policy
environment has not been conducive to private investment and output growth
because of too many regulations and controls hindering productive activity.
Estimated unemployment figures range from 11 to 25 percent, depending on
whether or not the informal sector is taken into consideration in the
methodology used for the calculations. Urban unemployment is further
aggravated by the return of many former emigrants. The possibilities of
the emigration safety valve for Burkina Faso to neighboring Cote d'Ivoire
and Ghana are dwindling. The recession in those countries has led to the
return of many migrants to urban areas and to a drop in the level of
remittances from US$192 million in 1986 to US$164 million in 1990. This
last level of annual remittances for 1990 remains significant as it exceeds
the combined earnings from cotton, gold and livestock exports estimated at
US$130 million annually.
1.10     In trying to deal with the economic crisis and rising
unemployment, the Government applied populist policies whose not economic
effect has been to worsen the centr government's deficit to an average of
12 1 percent over the period 1986-' ). Even after corrective measures, in
1990, the deficit was estimated a,  percent of GDP.  Also, internal as
well as external arrears have built up. Cumulated domestic and external



-3-
arrears were built up to an *stimatGd CFAF 83.4 billion at the and of 1990.
Current account deficits have been running at an average of around
14 percont of GDP between 1986 and 1990. It Is expected that deolininrg
terms of trade and a rising debt service ratio wil1 tend to worsen the
economic situation.
1.11     The recession has negatLvely afticted urbanization in the sense
that the central government has not been able to help the municipalities
supplv some basic services in terms uf infrastructure malntenance and
rehabilitation. Street curbs, storm dralnage cleaning, sidewalk
construction, culvert refitting and cleaning, garbage collection, road
maintenance are some of the urban public services affected by the lack of
remourcee of local gov*rnments. A shortage of government funds is
preventing needed public investment in maintenanco of school, clinLer -d
government buildings, all important elements tha%t create a conduclve
environment for private invoestment and employment expansion.  The
postponement of these investments is likel? to have a crltical impact on
sanitary and educational conditlons that w11 reduce the productlvlty of
labor and general economic growth. It is in this regard and in order to
alleviate the phycical decay in urban areaso especlally in Ouagadougou,
that the Government is eager to complement ito adjustment efforts with a
program of labor-intensive small urhan public works.  such a program will
also contribute to Ouagadougou's and other citilo' efficiency and
attractiveness for investors.
B.  G ernMent'e Policy and Undertakingj
1.12       In light of the gravity of this situation, the Government has
decided to adopt a set of auaterity measures to deal with the internal and
external imbalances and to stabilize the economy. Of utmost importance in
this regard are the negotiations that the Government has undertaken with
the World Bank and IMF to start serious reforms to ad ust the economy. A
structural adjuotment program war appraised in March 1991 and a donors,
conference is planned for late May in Geneva. Its effects are likely to
be: (a) improving public sector resource management; (b) allocating
resources for actione dealing with the poor and the disadvantaged;
(c) creating an environment conducive to greater private sector growth.
1.13     The Government has acknowledged its limitations in the area of
economic policies, inatitutioral arrangements, and management, and is
willing to implement the policy reforms necessary to make the critical
changes that will affect the conditions of the poor. Changes in the area
of reduction of the public wage bill, cost recovery, data collection,
privatization of public enterprises, trade reforms, etc., have been
identified in the SAL Action Program as levers that can make programs for
the poor more effective but also more efficient. It is in th-i regard that
actions have been identified to improve public resource management through
restructuring and refocussing current expenditurea and better programming
of public invoatment. In addition, the new Government has decided to adopt
a more liberal stance toward the private sector. The proposed Public Works
and Employment Project is considered by the Government as an element of its
effort to promote private sector development and employment. It li
expected that the use of labor-based technlques will be extended to other
projects in the urban and transport sectors.
1.14     Employment creation is one of the priorities identLfied by the
Goveriment for its second Five-year plan. The Government intends to carry
two kinds of action towards this objective. The first is by making new
investments to raise the level of national output and to keep it growing at
an annual rate of 4 percent. The second is by giving incentives to the
private sector to use more labor-intenaLve methods to generate more jobs.
Considering an unemployment base rate of 25 percent in 1990, an employment
growth rate of 3.8 percent and a population growth rate of 2.7 percent, t
has been projected that the unemployment rate can be reduced to 16 percent
by the year 2000. The unemployment rate can go down to 13 percent by the
year 2000 if the annual employment growth rate increases to 4.2 percent.

1.15     The Goverrnmont has boen examining various programs to deal with
the growing unemployment problem and appointed a coordinated group under
the Mtnist re d' stat A la Prdoidence. supported by UNDP and other donors,
thio group haf come up with several reconmondetiono suuh as the proposod
Public Works and Emplobment Project and the creation of a Fod n2noL d
l_emn1lo_ (FNE - Nationid Employment Fund), an agency to provlde toehnical
assistance to private entreprsneurn. Also, the Government, through the
ONPE, has experimented with employment promotion schemes  rsing labor-
intensive public worse in the rural areas.  Between 1981 and 1987, the ONPE
.-ployed 805,000 man/days or 3,200 jobs uO.ng a 250 day/year basis.  This
proqram was f..nanced by UNDP and the Inte. .ational Labor Office (1WO) for
an amount of 550 million CFAF, of which 52 percent went for the cost of
labor.
1.16     The proposed project exemplifies the new relationships between the
Government and the private sector. It is geared toward the needs of a
pecific stratum of tho private secror (the building and construction
industry) that has been adversely affected by the recession.  Through the
private sector, the project alao addresseo tne needs of the urban work
force that will be h red by the private firms to execute the works. The
proposal of the Government to name the Agency that will execute the
propoanS project "Paso Baara" i.e., building the fatherland, reflects the
attempt to combine traditional values with a willingness to lnnovaue and to
introduce management systems capable of expanding the production function.
C.  The Construction Industry:  Performance And ConstraAint
1.17     In order to better understand the characteristics of the
construction indusary, a survey of the target enterpi>.ses was undertaken to
uncover the constraints currently faced by them in connection with the
labor regulatory framework, credit availability, and public sector
contracting and contract administration. In particular, the survey was
aimed at obtaining a description of the enterprises themselves, including:
(a)   overall financial position (fixed capital, working capital,
short- and long-term debt, taxes owed, amounts owed by
Government)7
(b)   managerial aspects (qualifications of management and
workera, proportion of cost overruns and implementation
0ela .i in recent contracts, overall orientations of the
enteri -se in connection with public works); and
(c)   employment by category (indefinite contract, fixed-term
contract, daily laborers) and any hiring/firing p.!actices
worth noting.
1.18     The results of the survey indicate that, on the supply side, the
construction industry is almost totally dominated by the pr ivate sector,
while on the demand side, the public sector is predominant in Burkina Paso.
1.19     Generally, during the 1980'a, the construction industry followed
the curve of political events. From 1977 to 1982, the constructlon industry
ohowed an average growth rate of value-added of 8.5 percent per annum.
From 1982 to 1985, activities fell by 8.5 percent per annum. From 1985 to
1987, the growth rate of value-added bounced back to 9.8 percent. in 1985,
the enabling environment became more difficult as a result of new
regulations concerning investments, housing and urban development,
especially for the private sector. The enactment of a law against housing
rent collection in order to incite investments in agriculture or
manufacturing, led to a drop in the contribution of the construction
industry to the gross domestic product. This contribution reached then a
low of 5 percent as compared to the current 8 percent in 1990.
1.20      In 1987, the Government reversed its policy on private
construction and embarked on a construction program for moderate income
housing known ao Cit&o An II, An III, An IV et 1,200 dwelling units.



- 5 -
Coupled with other activities much as road pavinag and the building of the
Cam longa and Bagr- dame, the now atmoophero of liberal ization has led to a
revitallzatLsl  of the private construciyon industry. For the econd phaoe
of the 1,200 dwelling units construction program which started in March
1989, the supply response was evident in the presentation of tendore by a
total of 161 firms.  Eighty-six of these fLrms were qualified and
participated in the construction of 960 units which were completed in
November 1989 for a total cost of 5,350,000,000 CPAP.
1.21     The construction industry is estimated to have a current sales
volume of approximately 60 billion CPAF. Thio figure accounts for both the
formal and the informal sector. The 100 or so modern enterprises registered
in the former must be added to the 1600 micro-entrepreneurs or self-
employed tradesmen in the latter to arrive at the full understanding of the
composition and capacity of the construction industry. In the last three
years, as a whole, the construction industry has shown a qrowth rate of
approximately 4 percent. But from 1985 to 1990, the growth rate of the
formal oector was higher than that of the informal sector. While in 1985,
the formal sector contributed 38 percent of the sales volume of the
construction industry, in 1990 this figure rose to 51 percent. The large
investments of the Government mentioned earlier account for this growth. In
1985, it was estimated that there were a total of 11,073 persons working
primarily in the construction industry out of which 8,709 were working in
urban areas and the rest in rural areas. A second group of 8,629 working in
the construction industry as secondary activities was divided between 979
in urban areas and 7,650 in rural areas. The group of workers in the
construction industry includes masons, carpenters, plumbers, electricians,
paint3re, laborers, etc.
1.22     The wage bill in total construction cost varies depending on
whether the worxs are done in the formal or informal sector. Public works
done with labor intensive techniques reveal that at least one-third of
costs are distributed as salaries. In a similar project done in Senegal
and executed by the Agence d'Ex6cution des Travaux dtInt6r6t Public contre
le Sous-emploi (AGETIP), experience indicates that the wage bill
constitutes 37 percent of total construction costs. Based on the above, it
is possible to work with the hypothesis that the wage bill in total
construction cost is in a range starting from a low 20 percent and reaching
a high 40 percent depending on the formality or the informality of the
firms used to carry the works. In an urban pilot project located in the
city of Kaya, the ILO has arrived at a ratio of 37 percent for salaries in
total project costs, at a market wage rate of 600 CFAF per day. In any
case, the cost of labor is decided by the market between willing buyers and
sellers of labor.
1.23     By all accounts, the construction industry is dominated by the
public sector. Most contracts come from the Ministry of Equipment and are
for works ranging from paved roads, unpaved roads, road maintenance, feeder
roads, housing construction and transportation of construction materials.
There are also other ministries, government entities and local governments
or the technical services of municipalities that contribute to demand for
public works to be executed by small construction-related firms. This is
especially the case for municipalities whose budgets are too small to
undertake large works of sanitation, water supply, and rehabilitation. For
example, in 1990, the Haut Commissariat of Kad iogo, which is composed of
the five commune of Ouagadougou, only had an investment budget of 321
million CFAF (US$ 1.3 million) allocated respectively for public building
rehabilitation (11 million CPAF), road repair and cleaning of the urban
drainage network (200 million CFAF), garbage collection (60 million), etc.
The town of Bobo-Dioulasso, is facing a similar situation with a communal
budget evaluated at 200 million CFAF to finance everything from
construction of achools and clinics, garbage collection, to road and
gqseral infrastructure maintenance.
1.24     The structural adjustment reforms are likely to affect
particularly the constructlon industry as the Government will. not be able
to carry a strong investment program in infrastructure construction and in



- 6 -
the building construction area. As a consequence, it is posasble that
several "contr8leurs de travaux" and engLneer. from the public sector might
be lald off. They should be able to establlsh themselves on theLr own and
serve as maltres d'oeuvres under the proposed project.
1.2S     The domestlc constructlon lndustry is beoet by a number of
constraLnts that hamper lts expansion capacity and Lts abllity to
rtLcLpate ln the constructLon and malntenance of intrastructure. Even
for works whlch do not requlre high quallficatlons and could be effLcLently
carried out under labor-intensLve technlques by local small fLrms, most of
theme firms cannot be awarded or even bid for contracts under Government
projects, for two main reasons:
(a)   thelr low lovel of sophLst .cation with respect to adminietrative
and flnanclal management "kes it difficult for them to submit
acceptable proposals and to give evidence of their fulfilling the
demanding admLniLtrative requirements in accordance with the
cumbersome procurement procedures in force for publlc contracts;
and
(b)   current delayo experienced by contractors for being paid through
the Government's adminiLtrative procedures are measured in months
ln the best cases, and too often in years; only large firms with
substantial working capital can afford to awaLt payment for such a
long time.
The project is designed to address the Lssues that have been identified as
constraLnts in the areas of access to financing and training, as well as
with respect to simplifying bidding procedures and reducing pay-ment delays.
D. The Bankls Previou Role
1.26     Burkina Faso is one of the target countries of the regional Social
Dimensions of Adjustment program (SDA), the objectives of which are to
measure the effects of adjustment on households' standards of living,
especLally among the poorest segment of the populatLon and to propose
specifically tailored programs to alleviate strain on those most vulnerable
to the eff2'cte of adjustment policies. in this framework, a number of
surveys in the areas of agriculture, household consumption, health,
nutrLtion, demography, women condition, etc. are being planned for the
period 1991-1995. These various surveys will contribute to making available
needod data for the design of effective programs to alleviate the burden on
certain strata of the population.
1.27     In addition, the Bank has financri two urban projects in Burkina-
Faso.  The First Urban Project (Cr. 766-BUR) was approved in March 1978 and
completed on December 31, 1985. This US$10.8 milllon project, supported by
a US$8.2 IDA Credit (Cr. 766-BUR), successfully launched Government
upgrading and estes and services programs in Oua adougou and Bobo-Dioulasso
under the auspices of a project unit created wLt iLn the Ministry of
Iquipment, Directorate of Urbanism and Housing. The project took over six
years to complete, nearly twice the appraLial estimated time, due to a
Protracted debate on infrastructure standards, and water supply and housing
credit components, amounting to less than 20 percent of pro ect costs,
waLch were not implemented. Cost recovery and institutional objectives in
the urban and housing sectors were mi;t and the project had a significant
impact on urban policy and development in Burkina Faso. The project
resulted in the zupgrading of 438 ha (over 7,000 dwelling units), 97 percent
of the appraisal esiicmate  and 250 ha of serviced sites (4,500 units), four
tlmes more than the appraisal eatimate.
1.28     The Second Urban Project (Cr. 2067-BUR) was approved in
September 1989, became effective in September 1990 and is just beginning
execution. ThLi US$38.5 million project supported bv a US$22.2 IDA Credit
li focussing chiefly on iLifrastructure rehabilitation and on institutional



development and policy reform, such as the strengthenLng of municipal
functions and finances, including the revlsion of MuniCLpal and tax laws.
1.29     The proposed project, in focussing specifically on the building
and construction tradem, offer. small-scale Lnfrastructure work. that will
complemnt the very limited (due to flnancial constraints) *ot of larger-
scals works financed under the Second Urban Project. Subsequent Oank)
financed projects in the urban and transport sectors will benefit from the
enhanced capacities ct domestic contractors and consultants, as well as
from utreamlined procedures for contract management.
1.30               E          from  *tneal.  In order to help solve contract
management bottlenac   an  -o create smployment, IDA financed a similar
Public Works and Em,-Ljroyent Project in Senegal where an agency with private
status named AGETII has been created and is implementLng a labor-inteneive
civil works program. he project was declared effective on March 7, 1990.
AGETIP is currently  loementing a total of 110 small projects for a total
of CPAF 2.344 million.  WETIP 'ias constituted a filo of 100 mattres
d'oeuvre (consulting engIneers8 ancn 400 contracting f'.rms, some of which
are currently implementing ; Ir-ojects. The performance of AGETIP is
highly satisfactory, especiol X a& it has been able to complete the
execution of 53 projects and pes contractors in ten days instead of the 30
days required in the Manual oJ  Procedures guiding the works of the agency.
The projects implemented by AGETIP have gonerated a total of 433,000
man/days or approximately 3,000 jobs for a seven months period. Experience
has shown an employment ratio of 37 percent, higher than the estimated 33
percent used in project planning.
A. Project Objeitive.
2.01     The main objectives of the project ares
(a)   to finance a program of small municipal works in the area of urban
infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation;
(b)   to promote local private contractors and consulting firms in
project execution;
(c)   to improve, through execution of the works financed by the
project, the individual skills of the workers who will be employed
and the corporate competitiveness of the firms that will carry out
works so as to develop their capacity to respond to increased
opportunities for sustained employment after completion of the
project;
(d)   to create, at least temporarily, substantial new employment in
urban areas as rapidly as posi.ble using the private sector,
thereby stimulating small local private contractors and consulting
firms;
(-)   to review existing public works programs and recast them with the
intent of speeding up their implementation and overall
performance; and
(f)   to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects and
test the procedures that will ensure the public sector's ability
to commission such projects.
In pursuing these objectives, the following conditions should be
fulfilleds
(a)   avoiding any increase in civil service employment;



(b)   combining low cost and high visibllity;
(C)   supporting but not replacLng other development programol and
(d)   using transparent but expeditious and flexible procedures for
*ubproject bidding, appraisal, contracting, and dieburoemente.
B. Proiect Decri1tion
2.02     The components of the proposed project ares
(a)   a program of public facility and infrastructure rehabilitation and
maintenance in urban areas to be carried out under labor-inteneive
schemes by local contractors;
(b)   a Package of services related to work organization, management,
an;  labor force training to be offered on a voluntary basio to the
local contractors who will be awarded contracts under component
(a);
(C)   a supervision and monitoring component in order to closely monitor
the progress of the project and to prepare the transition toward
locally supported employment of the target group;
(d)   a selective audit of public works programs to identify bottlenecks
and design system improvements; and
(e)   a package of consultant services related to a training program for
the beneficiaries and engineering firms on the preparation of
feasibility studies and technical projoct proposals; and a program
aimed at increasing grassroots participation in urban
infrastructure maintenance.
2.03     An Executing Agency will be created to execute component (a) of
the project. The Agency will have a Board consisting of representatives of
the Twin City Association of Burkina Faso, the Construction Labor Union,
the Syndicate of Construction Firms, and Association of NGOs. The Agency
will serve as a model for other public agencies in terms of achieving low
costs and efficient work methods. It will have a small staff includ.ng an
Executive Director assisted by one Financial Director and one Technical
Dirsctor. The activities of the Executing Agency will be guided by a
Procedures Manual outlining the policies and procedures to be followed in
the conduct of its activities (see Annex II).
Imolementation of a Program of Labor-intensive Civil Works Suboroiects
2.04     The subprojects to be executed under component (a) will be
submitted by local overnments as well as by central and local branches of
the c _ tra _ Ger n Ment. The Executing Agency (see para 2.19 et. seq.)
will appraise the proposed subprojects, checking their eligibility in
regard to precise criteria which are listed in para II-4-3 of the
Procedure Manual. In the subproject selection process (Procedures Manual,
paras II-3 and II-4), the following criteria will be followeds
(a)   the subproject should have a proven economic and social utility
l.ee, tor econ=.ic subprojects, the rate of return shall be no
leos than that which is applied to the Public Investment Program
and for social projects (schools, clinics, etc.) the project shall
be the least-cost solutionl, and be ready for execution without
requiring substantial detailed engineering;
(b)   the subproject implementation should not require the use of
sophisticated equlpment and should be achievable through labor-
intensive methods (i.e., with labor, as a percentage of the total
cost, amounting to at least 20 percent);



-
(c)   if competinq wlth other subprojects for funds avaLlable during a
gLven perod, an ellglble subproject should have a higher rate of
return (and/or a demonstrated hlgher intangLble benefit
generatLon) than its competitoras
(d)   presfsrence wlll be given to those subprojects whleh are likely to
improve the skills of the workers involved and/or expose the
contractor to an experiLnce that would give him an advantage for
future actLvLtiesi
(a)   the subproject must fall within the 1L.t of elLgible "works" or
"services" activities mentioned below;
(f)   the subproject activities on site wlll start in less than three
months from the time of adjudication;
(g)   employment created by the subproject will be for a time period
greater than two weeks;
(h)   presence of at least two qualified enterhrises for the type of
works and ln the geographical area in which the project will be
executed;
(i)   the benefLicary has confirmed its financial and technical capacity
to maintain the works; and
(j)   the project is not financed by another donor; and
(k)   project has not been eliminated from the public investment program
(PIP). Although municipal expendLtures are not included in the
PIP, the criteria for sub-project selection under the project will
be equLvalent to those used for project selectLon in the PIp.
2.05     Eligible subprojects are expected to include (but not be limited
to) construction and repair of urban infrastructure and public facilities,
street and drainage network cleaning (especially sand and garbage removal),
as well as services to the population, such as garbage collectlon
(especially ln remote or difficult-to-access areas where the existing waste
management system is not effective). Provided that the eligibllity
criteria are met, eligLble subprojects will fall into two categories. The
first category of subprojecto--urban works-to which at least 60 percent of
funds will be allocated, include:
(a)   works for draLnage of low-lying areas, underground water mains,
observation platforms, cesspools, channel headers, retaining
walls, etc.;
(b)   minor infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation works (fillLng
in ravLnec, laying out sidewalks, repair of gutters and small
sanitatLon works);
(e) works like those under category (b) carried out on a recurrlng
basis and requirLng work program organization (e.g., fillLng in
potholes);
(d)   construction of simple buLldLngs such as schools or dispensaries;
(o)   repair of public buildings: this category is subdivided ln
accordance with the specialized labor involved (plastering and
painting, carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, roofing,
finishing, minor masonry work);
(f)   demolitLon of condemned buildings and recovery of materials;
(g)   clearing of brush and terracing works (road shoulders,
embankmento, gabiono) requLrLng construction based on pre-
establlshed plans; and



- 10 -
(h) works of water and soll conuervatLon.
The second category of subprojacts--urban servlces--to whlih at most
40 percont of all funds wlll be allocated lncludess
(a)   specLfic works for cleanlng public property: removal of sand from
roadways, cleanLng of draLnage dltcehs and gutters, garbage
collectLon, etc.
(b) works Like those undor category (a) carried out on a recurrLng
basls and requLrLng work program organlsatLon; and
(c)   plantLng and park workc.
In order to assure a primary focus on urban asset rehabllitatlon, it has
been necessary to splLt the allocatLon of funds between works and servlces
based on a 60740 ratio. Such a mechanLsm protects the majorLty of the
funds of the project from belng spent on menlal servLce activitLes that do
not contribute to buildlng the skills of the local constructlon lndustry
firms.
2.06     The Agency will submit for IDA's approval, prlor to offectLveness,
a llt of subprojects for the first year of project executLon amountLng to
a total of US$4.78 million (para 3.03(b)).  Also, the Agency wlll submit
for IDA's approval a second and a thlrd batch of ubprojects totalling
US$4.78 milllon each no later than September 15, 1992 and September 15,
1993 respectLvely   Subprojects whose estimated cost wlll exceed CFAF 100
million (US$400,000) will be subject to IDA's revlew and approval prlor to
flnal selectLon by the Executlng Agency (para 11-4-2 of the Procedures
Manual). The Agency will, however, carry out the regular appraLsal
procedure prior to submittlng the project and the appraisal report to IDA
for approval.
2.07     Once a subproject has been selected, the public agency which has
submLtted lt ("the benefLcLary") will enter lnto an agreement ("Convention
d  maltrAfe    u         dolf da u) with the Executlng Agency, accordIng to a
pro-established model which is attachod to section II of the Agency's
Procedures Manual. Thli agreement will lnclude Later alia the followLng
provisions:
(a) the Executing Agency is substituted for the beneficiary for the
whole execution of the subproject and has full authority, on
behalf of the beneficiary, to select the contractors, sign the
contracts, supervLse the works, acknowledge delivery, and pay
contractors;
(b)   the subproject is flnanced by the Executing Agency, on the basis
of the funds made available to lt under the project, and therefore
is addltlonal to the beneficLary's own capital budget or
Lnvestment program. The beneflciary wlll not be requested to
reLmburse the cost of the subproject;
(c)   the beneficlary pledges the respon:lbllity for the ongolng
malntenance of the subproject; in case of non-compliance wlth thls
clause, the boneficiary wlll not have access to the Agency's
financlal resource, until the sltuatlon is rectLfied; and
(d) provisions have also been devised to take care of possLble
litigatLon upon delLvery of the completed work to the
bon rLeLary.
2.08     In order to start up actual project lmplementatlon without delay
after effectlveness, a fLrst sample of ellglble subprojects has been
reviewed and approved by IDA. Flve oubprojects ranqing from CFAF 21
mllion (US$82 b00) to CFAF 77.5 million (US$310,000) will be carrled out
as subproject* wlth flnanclng provLded by a second PPF advance. These fLve
subprojeots comprise:



- 11 -
(a)   pavement, rehabilitation, and maLntonance of mLnor streets;
(b)   buildLng small damsp
(a)   rehabilitatiCn of a publLc buLlding;
(d)   cleaning of the urban draLnage network; and
(e)   garbage collection.
These subprojects represent fLve of the maLn categorLes of work to be
carrLid out under the project (Annex 2, SectLon II').
2.09     An important feature of the project i the Executing Agency's
dLibursoment procedure.  As polnted out above (para 1.25), a xane-qua-non
for small-scale enterprLses to be able to undertako works comnLsoioned by
publlc agencLes wlthout endlng up in bankruptcy is that diabursement
procedures be devised to avold the delays that are commonplace with regular
public procedures. Initial advances to contractors executing the works
will be given in exchange for a bank guarantee or a bond covering
100 percent of the amount of the advance that, ln any case, will not be
more than 20 percent of the total amount of the contract. Payments will be
echeduled accordLng to the terms and conditions set in Annex 2, Section V.
Furthermore, inltlal advances to the consultant engineer and the contractor
wlll be paLd in a tLmely manner and Ln a cashable form. For bld
preparations, the consultant englneer wlll be pald a maximum of
five percent of the estLmated coat of a subproject. For supervision and
monitoring, the engineer will be paid up to a maximum of five percent of
the total amount of the works.  Iti1 expected that the majorLty of the
enginsering services wlll be provlded by Burkinab& firms, thus helplng to
strengthen the local consulting industry. The private legal status of the
Executing Agency will allow the director to dlrectly order payments, by
slgning checks and transfer orders, wlthout beLng submitted to numerous
clearances and without belng obllged to surrender actual executlon of
payments to a Treasury officer ("prInclpe de la Bdparation de 1lordonnateur
et du comptable").  In order to glve incentives to the Executing Agency to
dLsburse quLckly and not be tempted to invest lts cash instead of paying
its contractors, timely payment of contractors, not exceeding 30 days
between work completion and payment, is considered as a key evaluatlon
criteria of the performance of the Agency.
A PackacQ of Technical,assistance Offered to.Contractors
2.10     This component aims at Lncreasing the technlcal and managerial
caacLty of small- and medLum-scale BurkLnab& contracting fLrms ln the
building and construction trades. The rationale behlnd this component is
twofold:
(a)   most firms in the target group are expected to show weaknesses, in
terms of management work organlzation, and technlcal skills,
which mlght jeopardize the succeesful implementatLon of the
subprojects that they will be commLssioned to carry out: the
provliion of some technLcal asslitance to contractors is deemed an
effective way to address thie risk; and
(b)   conversely, those flrms which are going to be awarded contracts
under the proposed projects may be expected to be comparatively
more effLcient than others, if the .electlon process is effective.
Therefore, wlth a view to strengthenLng comparative advantages
lnstead of randomly spreadLng aselitance over the whole lndustry,
these fLrms deserve more than others; to be supported to improve
the overall effLcLency and competLtLveness of the industry.
Three subprograms are proposed under this component:
(c)   a business adminLitratLon and fLnancial management program
Lntended for entrepreneurs and thelr administratLve staff;



- 12 -
(d)   a work organization program primarily designed for foremen; and
(a)   various technical training courses to improve the skills of basic
workers.
2.11     All three  ubprograms will be very practical and will take the
form of on-the-job :asistance and training. Potential beneficiaries will
be free to accept or refuse this form of assistance, except in cases where
technical assistance will be demed indispensable for successful
implementation of the subproject and will therefore be a condition of
contract award (para 3.02 (a)). A prellminary version of the training
program is found in Annex 7. This preliminary version wao discused at
negotiations and will be finalized no later than six months after
effectiveness.  Similar programs will be st up for tho implementation of
the proposed Transport Sector Adjustment Project, and coordination of
training components will be organized.
PrZaQiegM. Hnit:ring
2.12     The monitoring component will broaden the scope of the regular
supervision of any Bank pro ect.  Given the wide margin of independence and
initiative which is deemed  nstrumental to ensure tho Executing Agency's
efficiency and effectiveness, clooe and continuous           supervision and
monitoring are sosential to prevent the Agency from misusing its autonomous
decision power. Moreover, the many innovative features of the proposed
roject call for provisions enabling the Government and the donors to
3intly monitor progress of the project toward the proposed objectives and
to take expoditious measures if they assess that some misconception has
prevailed in the project design and that there is a danger of the
objectives being missed. The Borrower and IDA will meet at least twice a
year during the three-year period of project execution to exchange views
with regard to the progress of the project and subprojects, the management
of the Agency's operations, the performance of its personnel, includlng key
personnel, the performance by the Agency of its obligations under the
Convention between the Government and the Agency, and particularly the
procurement practicea and procedures being followd by the Agency pursuant
to the Procedures Manual. In order to make relevant information available
for the above-mentioned meetings, consultant services (e.g., management and
financial audits of the Executing Agency, studies of the impact and
performance of already Lmplemented subprojects and performance of
procurement procedures) will be identified and agreed upon with the
Government by regular supervision missions and wll be commissioned by the
Agency upon request by the Government in order to deliver findings and
recommendations in a timely man.ner for the above meetings.
Public Works Contract Manaaement Audit Study
2.13     This component will consist of a study and audit of the Public
Investment Program to uncover the bottlenecks in procurement, contractIng,
works supervis on, paents, and audits that impede project implementation
A para 2.01(e).  In PYB9, the Burkina Public Investment Program had a
iseburement ratio of about 50 percent for project lending. The study and
audit, to be carried out by a private firm, will help the Government to
document problem areas and will at the sam time demonstrate the benefits
of alternative procedures and contract administration methods that
emphasize efficiency and transparency used bi the Public Works Employment
Project.  The terms of reference for the audit were agreed with IDA at
negotiations (para 3.02(d)). It was also agreed at negotiations thats
(a)   within six months of the conpletion of the study and not later
than January 31, 1993, the Government will present to the Bank for
its comments an Action Plan to adopt the changes recommended by
the study and to determine how they will be implemented; and
(b)   the Government will subsequantly implement the agreed Action Plan,
no later than July 31, 1993.

TrALning Proaorm frBnfcaisAnd Enaineere Firms.
2.14     This component would provide oupport to the beneficiaries and to
local engineering firms to prepare the feasibility studies and technical
project proposals that will be submitted to the Executing Agency for
funding. The submission for IDA's approval of the program for the
implementation of this component is a condition of Projeoct effectiveness
(para 3.03 (e)).
9smarnots ParticinatIon Proaram
2.15     This component will help organize a program to increase grassroote
participation in urban infrastructure project maintenance. This program
will diseminate information (using the local languages, logos, appropriate
colora and music) to the chefs de quartier, neighborhood committees and to
the tAcherons and micro-entrepreneurs to increase their awareness of the
project as a whole and to increase the level of responsibility that the
community feels with respect to project works. In this framework, a number
of activities will be periodically organized to increase public awareness
and support for the project. At the beginnin , these activities will
include an information seminar to distrIbute documentation and to sensitize
the population on the project, a meeting of the general assembly of the
Agency, and a week-long campaign in the media. These activities will be
repeated at appropriate intervals to reinforce the messages. The objective
of this effort is to improve communLcatLon between the grassroots and local
authorities so that the former are consulted on projects that affect their
neLghborhood, before they are presented to the Agency for funding and
implementation. This is particularly important ln the case of garbage
collection and sewer cleaning, where grassroots partLcipation can make a
difference in terms of public hygiene. This component will be contracted
out to specialized firms under the overall management of the Executing
Agency.  The initial seminar will be financed under the second PPF, and a
detailed plan for follow-up activities will be presented to the
AssocLatLon no more than six months after project effectiveness (para 3.02
(a)).
C. Rationale for Bank group Involvement
2.16     The Government of Burkina Faso is faclng a serious fiscal deficit
that is straining Lts public investment capacity. In order to improve this
situation, it has committed itself to apply a series of measures and carrv
out certain reforms to correct the external and internal imbalances. WhiL.
preparlng a structural adjustment program whose aim is to improve public
sector resource management, the Government approached IDA to undertake a
program of small urban infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation works
that would complement the more extensive works being carried out under the
Second Urban Project. Municipalities have a whole list of projects ranging
from street paving, road maLntenance, drainage rehabilitation, refurbishing
schools and clinics, etc., that cannot be funded because of the diminution
of public investment brought by the austerLty resulting from the economic
crisie. While having a long-term beneficial impact on economic growth, the
execution of these needed urban works will also contribute in the short
term to employment creation in the construction-related trades. Because
the project provides the opportunity for the private sector to grow and to
demonstrate its capacity to implement efficiently and effectively public
programs, it will support the reforms that are being undertaken at the
macro level. IDA knows the urban sector and, buildIng on Lts experience in
eimilar projects in Senegal and Niger, can help the Government to support
the municipalities to achieve theLr primary task of cleaning and
iaintaLinng roads and drainage systems, collecting garbage, bulldlng and
rehabilitatlng ochools, dispensarLes, and other small economic and social
infrastructure.

2.17     A first US$600,000 PPF advance was granted to finance project
preparation which included:
(a)   a survey of the target firms  intended to provide information
needed for deslgnling ligibility criteria and implementation
arrangements and to claseify engineering firms and contractors in
terms of capacity and specialty;
(b)   the hiring of a law firm to look into the appropriate legal status
for the Executing Agency and to make roposals ln relation to the
Agency's organization, procedures, and bylaws;
(c)   the short-term consultant services in various fields (law,
engineering, accounting, organization, etc.) needed for project
preparation;
(d)   the preparation of a listing of eligible works to be executed, as
well as a listing of engLneerin and construction firm to serve
as supervisors and contractors in line with the recomnendations of
the Manual of Procedures of the Agency;
(a)   the preparation of bidding documents and engineering designs for
the first five pilot subprojects;
(f)   a mission of Burkinabb officials to Dakar to acquaint themselves
with a similar organization called AGETIPI and
(g)   a study of the participation and involvement of the population in
the identification and routine maintenance of the public works to
be executed under the project.
2.18     The liroject appraisal took place from March 23 to April 9  1991.
Drafts of the Procedures Manual and the Convention, which were reviewed
during appraisal, have been submitted to IDA, and were fLnalized during
negotiatione (para 3.01(a)). Candidates for the position of Executive
Director were reviewed during appraisal. A candidate for the position of
Director has been selected by the Government and approved by IDA (para 3.01
(bM). He accompanied the delegation at negotiations held in May 1991. He
ha started working as a consultant for the project and will work full-time
starting June 1, 1991. A draft of the Agency's Procedures Manual has been
completed and submitted to IDA. The Procedures Manual was reviewed and
agreed upon at negotiations (paras 3.02(b) and is attached to the
Ov I  to be entered into by the Government and the Agency.
2.19     A second PPF advance of US$900,000 has been granted in order to
execute five pilot subprojects, hire the staff of the Executing Aqency,
fine-tune implementation arrangements (includlng accounting procedures) and
fund the initial phase of the grassroot participation program before full-
scale launching of the project.
S. Proiect Coot and Flnanging plan
2.20    Proiect Cost.  The project cost is estimated at US$22.2 million
equivalent (CFAF 5.5 billion net of taxes and dutis) out of an overall
program (including cofinancing) of US30 million.  Th  estimated foreign
exchange component is US$4.5 million or 20 percent of the total cost. Base
cost estimates are in mid-1991 prices. Annual inflation rates have beon
*stimated as follows:

2.21     Since the volume of local works under tl. first component will be
adjusted according to available funds, price contingencies have not been
appliod to the estimated local cost of Component (a) which comprise  79
percent of total base costs.  Price oontingencLes on tho remaining small
components amount to 1 percent of base costs. A summary of cost estimates
is presented in Table 2.1. Detailed project costs are provided in Annex 3.

2.22        hnLnZgan.  The proposed IDA credit of US$20 million will
finance 6  percent of project costs not of duties and taxes.  Thli  will
cover approximately USD3.9 million of foreign costs and US$20.45 aillion of
local costs.  All subproects to be carried out by the Executing Agency
will be exempt from d arect duties and taxes.  A US$2.2 million local
contribution will be provided to the Executing Agency from Government
budgetary resources to finance new subprojects (in addition to those
financed by IDA and other codonors). It was agreed at negotiations that
the Government will$
(a)   cause the Executing Agency to execute new subprojects to the
aggregate value of US$2.2 million equivalent before December 31,



- 16 -
1994, of which subprojects totalling the equivalent of at leaat
US$730,000 would be completed by December 31, 1992. Additional

2.23     The implementing arran ements are deemed critical for effective
fulfillment of the project's ob ective:  the Executing Agency will be
created as a not-for-profit entity with private legal status, fulfilling a
condition for project effectiveness (para 3e03 (a)). Considering the
linkages of this project with two other projects, i.e., the urban and the
transport projects, the Agjency is likely to become a general contractor
performing project execution for a fee. It is expected that the
improvement in municipal finances resulting from the urban project and the
road works coming out of the transport project create the demand for the
services of the small entrepreneurs whose capacity will be strengthened
through the project. In this regard, the Agency is likely to become an
"Agence de Ville" (town ageacy), executing works for the municipalities
financed by their own budget, as the example of AGETIP in Senegal is
beginning to suggest.  Such an agency will be able to avoid the cumbersome,
slow, and inefficient procedures that public institutions are obliged to
follow for calling for bids, awarding contracts and disbursing, and which
result in d        discrimination against small contractors.  The Agency's
operating procedures and internal organization were carefully and precisely
designed during project preparation and appralsal and are contained in a
Procedures Manual that will be attached to the Q          to be entered
into by the Government and the Agency for the execution of the project. A
condition of project effectiveness is that the Convention be signed by the
Borrower and the Executing Agency (para 3.03(c)),  As described above
(paras 2.04 to 2.08), the Procedures Manual will include:
(a)   eligibility criteria for selecting subprojects submitted by local
and central administrations for implementation under the proposed
project;



- 17
(b)   procoduroe for selecting contractors, calling for bids, and
awarding contracts;
(C)   dioburoement proceduresl and
(A%   internal organization for work supervision, control, and delivery
of complotoo works.
2.24     In order to ensure expeditious implementation of the program, the
Executing Agency will have full authority--and will not be submitted to any
p_ftl clearance--for carryng out the whole process of project execution.
In particular, the public institutions which will propose subprojects will
have to surrender their authority for execution of the subpro3ect up to
delivery of completed works. In return, they will get the works financed
by the project in addition to their own investment budgets.
2.25     The Executing Agency will be submitted to close ex st
supervision by the Government and will have to furnish detailed activity
reports every other month. The Governament and IDA will meet at least twice
a year during the period of project execution to exchange views
comprehensively on the project execution performance. Resources of the
Executing Agency will be replenished only upon presentation of properly
documented records of the use of funds.  The above-mentioned meetings
between the Gorernment and IDA may result in proposing and implementing any
measure that will be deemed useful to ensure actual fulfillment of the
project's objectives, ircluding hiring and dismissal of the Agency's staff.
2.26     The professional experience of the Agency's staff shall be
acquired mainly from private sector. Any staff member from the public
sector would have to resign or be placed on "leave without pay* status
before accepting a position in the Agency. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from the Government concerning its responeibilities to ensure
that any change in the director of the Executing A.gency will be acceptable
to the Association (para 3.02(g). The compensation offered to the staff
will be high enough to make it attractive to top-level professionals. The
Agency Directcr was selected and participated in negotiations. He is a
Burkinabg with private sector experience.
2.27     The creation of the Executing Agency and the recruitment of the
Executing Agency staff, in particular its General Director, its Technical
Director and Financial Director with the qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Association, are conditlons of effectiveness (para
3.03(a)).
2.28     The project will be executed over a period of three years.
G. Prg2uraMgnt
2.29     The procurement procedures according to which the Executing Agency
will select contractors and award contracts are another important feature
of the project. They were discussed during appraisal. They were agreed
upon with the Government at negotiations (para 3.02 jh)), and included in
the Agency'e draft Procedures Manual (Sections III and IV).
2.30     The Agency will maintain a roster of contractors eligible for
Local Competitive Bidding (LCB).  Prior to effectiveness, the Agency will
be required to broadly advertise a cell for applications to initlate this
roster.  The Executing Agency at she beginning of its activities will
select an initial list of eligible contractors and engineering firms
according to procedures acceptable to IDA and splled out in Section III of
the Procedures Manual. When applying for ragistration, the contractors
will provide once and for all the adminlitrative data regarding the firm
and a list of references. Applications will specify the category or
categorios of works for which the firm applies (according to a pre-
established list of categories provided in para 111-1 of the Procedures
Manual), the geographical area in which the firm is prepared to carry out
works, and references relative to the types of works sought. IDA will



-18 -
review and approve this inLtial valeation a:sd satisfy itself that the
rocodures agreed upon at negotiations within the Procedures Manual have
goon satisfactorily follwowd. This pr-qualiflcation of eligible
contractors and engineering firma is a condition of effectlveness
(para 3.03(d)). Th roster will stay open during project execution so as
to allow add tional applications at any t). e   Larg  firms using modern
equipment are not likely to be interered by the typ  and site of most
subprojeote proposed, but they are not precluded from participation in the
process.  The purpose of preregistration will be to detrmine the
contractors who can demonstrate their ability to carLy out the proposod
labor-intensive works effectiFely and will, therefore, be eligible to bid.
Besides the fulfillment of administrative and legal requirements, the
firms' references will be aritical for them to be preselected. Later on,
actual performance of the contractors who are awarded contracts by the
Agency will provide the basis for the Agency to reassess their registration
and upgrade or downgrade it.

2.31      The target group of firms for technical assistance comprises
rimarily small-scale enterprises, which are more likely than lare ones to
id for labor-intensive projects. However, given the low level or
sophistication of these firms in regard to administrative and financial
management, they are currently discriminated against by the procurement
procedures in force for public contracts.  This is one of the basic reasons
why it has be3n deemed necessary to establish a special agency, with
prlvate legal status, to implement the project. Basically, the objective
of the standard procurement procedure is to ensure fair competition among
eligible contractors without requiring from them the preparation of a
complex proposal, including detailed calculations of price. The coro of
the procurement procedure will be local advertisement among registered
contractor of a proposed contract for a given subproject.  All contractors
registered in the roster for the category of works and the area concerned



- 19 -
by the subproject will be Lnvited to bid. The contract, whlch will be
written in simple language and will describe the scope and nature of the
works, proposes a reference price with some straightforward explanations
about its calculation (unit prices and quantitLes). Contractors will be
invited to bid by way of dlicounts either on the total prlce or on the unit
prLeas. Among eligible bidders, the winner will be selected on the baLsi
of the proposed discount and other criteria (such as timeliness of
performance)--if any is specified in the bldding documents--and invited to
sign the proposed contract. The contract awardlng commlttee, composed of
the Agency's Dlrector General, Technical and FinancLal Directors
(para IV 1-2 of the Proceures Manual) will have full authority to select
the winner. However, it will have to justify in writlng ln the minutes of
the meeting, and in reference to the expicit criteria isted ln the
bidding documents, any decision not to select the lowest bid. The
contracting awarding committee will open the bids in public and the bLddLng
firms or their representatives can be present at that meeting. For all
contracts for which there are less than five bidders or for contracte wLth
an eotimated cost equal to or greater than CPAF 62.5 million (US$250,000),
the awarding committee will submit its decision to IDA for approval prior
to notifying the winning bidder.
2.32      It is anticipated that all the civil works contracts will be
below CFAF 100 million (US$400,000). In case any contract is higher than
this value, International Competitive Bidding proceduro (ICE) wIll be
followed for such procurement.
2.33      Consultant services for training, technical assistance, and
project monitoring will be procured according to IDA guidelines, spelled
out in Guidelines Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrovers and by Ahe
World Bank as Executing Agency. A summary of the consulting services
required is given in Annex 8.
2.34      These procurement procedures have been used for one year under a
similar project ln Senegal and have worked well. As in the Senegal
project, only parallel financing is envisaged. Should joint fLnancing
occur, it will be done in accordance with IDA Guidelines.
H.   D1A ,fl
2.35      The proposed IDA Credit Lb vxnicted to be totally dLsbursed by
January 30, 1995, Disbursements will be made on the basis of 100 percent
of total expenditures for the Asnoclat -es share of civil works and
100 percent for all other categories. The Government will dLiburse 100
pourcent against its share of civil workA contracts, equivalent 'o 10
percent of the sum of civil works finang 14 jointly by IDA and by the
Government. This procedure has been seleU 7ed to ensure the independence of
the Executing Agency in making payments t4 contractors, who have had very
bad experiences with         u odisburseme-  procedures.  To ensure that
the Association does not disburee all of i % contribution wLthout
correspondinc action by Government, a condiV'on has been devised to permlt
the AssociatLon to sumpend disbursements a: the end of the flrst and second
years, should the Government have failed t) make its contribution.

accounts will be maintained by the Executing Agency. These accounts will
be audited at the end of each of the first two quarters, and every six
months thereafter by independent auditors acceptable to IDA according to
terms of reference agreed by IDA. Auditors will express separate opinions
on statements of expenditures. The terms of reference for auditors were
agreed at negotiations (para 3.02(e)). The setting-up of an operational
accounting system and the selection of the auditors are conditions of
effectiveness (para 3.03(e)). Project accounts and auditors' reports will
be submitted to IDA within one month of the close of each of the first two
quarters and thereafter within two months of the close of each semester.
The Executing Agency will submit progress reports every other month and
prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR) within three months of the
closing date. It was agreed at negotiations that there will be a mid-term
review of the management of the operations of the Executing Agency, the
performance by the Executing Agency cf its obligations under the Convention
(including procurement procedures), and the performance by the Executing
Agency and Implementing Enterprises of their respective obligations under
Subproject Agreemento, to be carried out by the Association and the

K. Environmental IM2act
2.40        Works to be financed under th- projet will be small and
scattered and their cumulative impact on th physical environment is
expected to be minor.  May of the ellgible subprojects, both works and
services, will have a not positLve impact on th  urban envlronment.  Thin
is particularly true of subprojects such as soll and water conservation
works, draLnage improvements and terracing, sanitation improvements,
planting and park works, and solid waste collection. All subprojects will
be consistent with the Strategic Agenda for Improving Urban Living
Conditions that will be executed under the soon to be completed Burkina
Faso National Environmental Action Plan. The project is classified am
Category C.
L. EconoMic_AnlJyjis
2 41        Although the justification of the project cannot be expressed
solely in terms of economic feasibility, an economic analysis will be
carrLed out for a sample of typical subprojects on the basis of a
comparison of discounted economic costs and benefits over time. Specific
benefits depend on the type of subproject, but include among other things:
(a)     reduction in vehicle operating costs (in the case of urban road
maintenance or rehabilitation subprojects);
(b)     reductions in the cost of services, in the case of labor-
intensive garbage collection which would otherwise be
undertaken by more mechanized technologies; and
(c)     avoided cost of reconstruction (in the case of subprojects
involving maintenance or rehabilitation of infrastructure
and/or buildings that would otherwise deteriorate).
In the cases of road rehabilitation and construction of drainage canals,
economic rates of return have been calculated at 12 and 27 percent
respectively. Annex 6 presents the details of these analyses.
M.  Benefits
2.42      The project will assist municipalities and "collectivit6s
locales" to carry out useful investment in rehabilitation and maintenance
of public infrastructure. It will help promote the private sector,
especially the small firms in construction-related industries that will be
engaged to execute the works. It will create employment as these firms
will hire laborers and technicians to fulfill their contracts. It will
promote the local engineering and architectural consulting industry which
will provide subproject  upervision services.  The project will also help
the Government in the area of contract management. It will demonstrate the
efficiency of private sector policies and procedures in public works
msanagemen.tw The ultimate direct beneficiaries will be the low-paid
temporary workers in the building and construction trades. Since these
work er tnd to spend their wages close to home, substantial multiplier
effects on the local economy can be expected, although they cannot be
quantified. Indeed, the focus of the project is further justified by the
fact that the targeted industry (building, construction, maintenance, and
urban services)--more than any other industry--hires and dismisses labor
according to contract opportunities. This maxLmizes the probability that
an increase in the industry's activity will actually result in an increase
in employment. The proposed project is justified by indirectly securing
other development and structural adjustment objectives through its
contribution to the creation and maintenance of a favorable climate for the
Government to continue pursuing adjustment policiee. The prcoject will also
help the Government in the area of program management. It will demonstrate
the possibility of efficient private sector management in public works
execution.



- 24 -
2.43        Given the individualistic nature of private-coctor, and
especially construction industry, wage setting, it ie not possible to be
pr-ese about the number of jobs that will be created.  An estimate has
n made based on survey results concerning the market clearing wage rate
for willing buyers and sellers in the labor market in Burkina Faso. The
observed weighted-average wage rate on formal sector construction siteo is
CFAAF 34,250 per month. Informal sector wage rates for labor-intensive
urban projects are observed to average CFAI 13,200 Per month. If we assume
that one-third of the subprojects will be executed by formal sector firms
and two-thirds by informal sector firms, the estimated one-third of civil
works costs that will be distributed as wages would result in about 3,900
persons being put to work for the seven month construction season for each
of the three years of project execution.
2.44    The main risks arise from the possible inability of Burkina Faso's
economy to develop enough stable job opportunities at the end of the
proj ect period, leading to pressure from the Government to extend the
project beyond its initial three years. This risk cannot be addressed
with in the proposed project but should be alleviated if the ongoing
adjustment process is implemented successfully. The risk will aloo be
reduced by the development of stable infrastructure maintenance programs
that are being developed under Bank-supported urban and transport projects.
Another risk is that continued employment for those who would benefit from
the program should not take the form of their being hired by local
governments when the program ends. Such continuation of employment would
jeopardize previous efforts of public sector management improvement,
including restrictions on personnel hiring, implemented during the recent
years by the central and local governments. Last, the control of proper
use of funds is more difficult with such a program than with regular
inveatment projects. The implementing arrangements will be carefully
designed to minimize this risk. As a result, project selection will be
carried out according to economic criteria and approved by the Association.
Financial management will be closely monitored through oix-monthly audits
of the Agency's operations.
III.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01    The following were fulfilled prior to negotiations:

amdliorer ausui le cadre de vie.
Calcul d'lndicatemrs
1.    Main d'oeuvre
Le poste main d'oeuvre ressort & 6,335,300 FCFA, soit 23.6% du co8t du projet. Un chef
superviseur, 42 ouvriers, 27 sp6cialistes travalleront sur le chantier avec un total de 152
hommes/mois, etalds sur 3 mois.
2.    Ddlai d'&ude et de demarrage
Les ddlais d'Etudes sont maltrisables mais les ddlais de ddmarrage ddpendent des procddures
de mise en place de l'agence qui supervisera l'exdcution du projet. Dans tous les cas, la restauration
durera 3 mobs I partir du ddmarrage effectif du chantier.
OpportunitE eonomique
Nul doute que la valeur d'une nouvelle construction de mait4  de meme capacite s'6lbverait
& plus de 270 millions. L'administration de l'H6pital avait envisagE une extension pour la
construction d locaux des services techniques: (a) un bloc technique; (b) des salles d'accouchement;
et (c) des salles d'opdration, pour une estimation de plus de 100 millions de francs CFA. La
refection coote 26,786,823 FCFA et cela permettra de recreer des conditions sanitaires agrdables de
travail et de sejour mais la ndeessitd de construire les extensions pour services techniques s'impose,
afin d'augmenter la capacitd d'hebergement en libErant les salles et bureaux occupds presentement.
Les services tehniques actuels occupent des salles qui n'Eaient pas conques pour cela, ce qui
pose le problbme des normes hospitalieres qui ne sont pas respectdes.
La matrnit fait partie de l'Hopital dont elle dEpend de la gestion. Les recettes de la
maternitd sont donc gdres dans l'ensemble par l'H6pital.
Copendant, pour information, voici les tarifs appliques & la matemitd de 1'H6pital Yalgado

Bnficlirg: Haut commissariat du Kadiogo   NM: Enlbvement des
ddchets solides
Description technique
Le manque de moyens humains et matriels dans le domaine de laassaisement,a epour
consequence, la concentration d'ordres mdnagbres dans presque tous les quartiers de la ville de
Ouagadougou, et plus particulibrement aux abords des barrages.
Ces ordures menageres menacent gravement la qualitd des eaux et la sante des populations.
Le projet consiste I I'evacuation de ces tas d'ordures, vers des depots bien choisi de la ville,
en particulier le bas-fond du secteur 27.
Les travaux se ddrouleront en plusiours phases:
(a)    enlbvement des dldments importants (ferrailles d'automobiles, troncs
d'arbres, etc.);
(b)    piochage des tas compacts;
(c)    chargements manuels des dechets;
(d)   transports des dEchets vers les dEpotoirs choisis;
(e)    nettoyage des sites.
Une stratdgie de haute intensitE de main d'oeuvre sera appliqu6e pour crEer le maximum d'emplois.
ElEments du oofit
Le coOt total de I'opdration test, pour l'enlbvement des ordures dans les secteurs (12, 11, 10,
19, 7, 8, 16) reprdeant 6737 mn, est estimE h 21,892,691 FCFA. Les travaux s'Echelonneront sur
une pdriode de 3 mois, et occuperont pendant cede pEriode 69 personnes. L'ealbvement journalier
sera d'environ 112 m3 et ndcessitera 4 camnions de 6 n'.
Pour les opErations futures du mOme type, la crEation de PME en la matibre avec des
charreltes I traction animale comme moyen de transport, cr6era un nombre plus important d'emplois.

Ciads d'lndcataurs
Le coat de la main d'oeuvre est estin  & 6,811,958 FCFA sur un coOt tot du projet de
21,892,691 soit 37.3%. Cette main d'oeuvre non spdciisde servira essetillemet au ramasage
et chargement des ordures. Le transport Eant assurE par camion pendant une durde de 3 moDs, le
dElai soubaitd (3 mois) pout l'enl&vement des ordures ndcessite obligaoirement des beanes comme
nmoyens de transport. Dans l'hypothWse de dElais, plus importans, we partie de ces ordures pourra
Ote ealevEe par des charrettes & traction animale.
OppwtunitE Economique
L'enl&vement des ordures le long des barrage de la vile de Ouagadougou, en una ndcessitd
incontournable. En amdliorant la saE  des populations, le projet acrottlra leur pacipa ion aux
t*cdes do ddveloppement. En crdant des emplois il paricipera au dEveloppme  socio-6oonomique
des couches les plas defavorisEes de la population (69 emplols pendant 3 mobs sok 4,140 h/j). En
outre le projet apportera la preuve que l'accumulaton des ddchets n'est pas une fatalite, et quo leur
Elimination ameliore I'environnement et le cadre do vie. I favorisora la creation de PME pour
I'enlbvement des ordures dont l'accmulation doviendra Inaccpble pour les populations.

plan d'action pour sa mise en oeuvre.
F.ORMAII
Les ledments composant l'aspect formation sont regroupes sous le single IFAT (Information,
Formation, Assistance Technique) car les trois aspects seront souvent imbriques.
TINEQMAlQ
Une joumee de type grand public" devrait suffire pour presenter:
(a) le projet TIPE
(b) les procedures appliqudes pour les marches,
(c) l'appui A attendre de l'Agence et des partenaires.
11 ne semble pas que des frais de participation soient I demander. On notera seulement les
personnes et entreprises qui assisteront a la seance mais aussi celles qui veulent se lancer dans
I'operadon. Un Oventuel questionnaire I ce sujet pourrait Wtre remis en seance, a rendre de suite ou
A retourner & l'Agence sous huitaine.
1I conviendra d'examiner sous quelle dgide (ministbre, Chambre de Comnmerce) cette
manifestation sera placee. L'important est surtout qu'elle soit tres largement annoncde.
Si des erntreprises n'avaient pu participer pour diverses raisons, cette journde sera
repEtEe 15 jours plus tard.
EORMAIJQN
Chefs d'entreprlse
Les cycles seront I deux niveaux:
- entreprises dEj& structurdes
- entreprises artisanales ou assimildes (cycle allege en contenu et duree)
Deux volets principaux:
- gestion et organisation generale de l'Entreprise
- techniques BTP (dont application des principes de gestion et organisation A la
particularit4 de ce secteur d'activitE)
Selon le niveau: 12 & 15 sdances de deux I trois heures en salle, & la cadence d'une
ou doux sdances par semaine, soit une durde moyenne de trois mois.

Pour les ouvriers. I perfectionner, il conviendra de trouver les ateliers adaptes
(Etbllsemit de l'Enseignement Technique, Centre de Porfectionnement de I'Artisanat, ....)
Une difficulte importante, dans un pays qui ose avouer I'analphabWtisme des masses
laborieuses, est de dispenser une formation I des personnes illettrdes ou au niveau educatif faible,
sinon nut. Cela plaids en faveur de l'application de methodes trbs actives de pure Formation
Professionnelle, point dvoque par ailleurs. II n'empeche que les methodes les plus sophistiquees se
heurtent toujours I I'analphabetisme.
On peut imaginer, aprbs discussion avec l'lnstitut National d'Alphabdtisation, qu'une
action d''lhabtisation fonctionnell BTP pourrait ameliorer la situation. Les fomateurs sont
disponibles. Un specialiste extdrieur (UNESCO) aiderait I mettre au point un cours special. Si trois
mois peuvent suffire I la preparation, six mois I la realisation (300 heures de cours) on travaillerait
I partir de 1993 avec une population beaucoup plus apte a recevoir une formation et surtout a la
poursuivre ultErieurement.
Maitre-d'oeuvre, architectes, cabinets d'ing6nlerie
Cette action relbve plus de l'information que de la formation, s'agissant d'impliauer
ceux qui auront un r8le important A jouer pour la rdussite du Projet.
Cinq ou six sdances en reunion-discussion d'une demi-journee, peut-etre moins,
devraient suffire pour motiver, montrer le rOle technico-p6dagogique I jouer, envisager comment
mieux faire passer l'information auprbs des entrepreneurs et des chefs de chantier.
La durEe peut se justifier si les interessds sout *preneurs' d'aspects techniques BTP
quo certains paraissent vouloir approfondir.
Assistance Technique
On a vu qu'elle etait presente tout au long des cycles de formation, lors de la phase
d'application sur le terrain des acquis et lors des sEances en salle.
Elle sera renforcEe par les mattres-d'oeuvre dans leurs relations avec les entreprises.
Elle s'exercera ensuite sous coordination de l'Agence, I titre ondroux, chaque fois
qu'uno enteprise souhaitera recevoir un appui particulier pour I'exEcution de travaux.
Pour crtains marchEs, on peut imaginer que des seances - rejoignant l'aspect
information - setient organisdes pour apporter des precisions techniques sur tel type de marchE.
Un des domaines important de ce volet concermera l'assistance a la creation
d'ontrepriso. Des dtudes ulterieures montreront silfaut organiser des journdes d'etude ou un cycle
spEcial de formation sur ce thtme.
Tcahlquu PEdagogiques PrlvilEgides
L'ensemble dtu programme est plact sous le signe de l'amdlioration des compEtences
(ou des qualifications") d'adultes dej& engages dans la vie active.

11 s'agit moins d''ccrottre ses connaissanCes que d'a etacjE  ou fQnctions
soul un autr ange, donc se remettre en cause, perdre ses habitudes, modifier son comportement,
changer....
Un expose "tres intEressant" sur le planning des travaux ne sipnifie pas que I'auditeur,
mOme s'il a "tout compris" se lancera pour en faire un le lendemain....
De tel dvidences et lieux comnmuns en matibre de FORMATION sont bons a rappeler
devant les pratiques observeos ou les points de vue exprimds.
C'est le cas, par exemple, lorsque l'Enseignement Secondaire Technique envisage un
vaste programme de formation continue sans paraltre, semble-t-il, preoccupe de l'approche toute
diffdrente que cela suppose: dispenser un savoir a 40 jeunes en quete d'un diplome, donc en "terrain
neuf", n'a aucune commune mesure avec le perfectionnement de 12 adultes dans un metier qu'ils
maltrisent (ou pensent maltriser) peu ou prou et I qui on va demander de revoir leur fa&on de faire
(du savoir au savoir etre en passant par le savoir faire).
C'est un peu le cas, aussi, quand le Centre de Formation des TP veut lancer le
"perfectionnement', le "tecyclage', la 'formation continue' (termes distincts curieusement choisis
selon le crittre de la duree...) avec des intervenants extdrieurs, par exemple techniciens dans un
ministbre, dont on se demande comment le "cours" peut porter effet, sinon celui d'une satisfaction
intellectuelle.
Sans pouvoir developper ici, on rappelera: methodes actives, partant du reel, du
concret I i'abstrait (et non linverse) et participatives....
Cela va jusqu'au vocabulaire k oublier: professeurs, cours, dlbves, notes, Ecole,
travaux pratiques... et meme seminaires (mot impropre, s'agissant de colloques, symposium ou tout
simiplement de journees d'etude ou journees d'information), en faveur de cycles, seances de travail,
rEunion sur le tas, sessions, rencontres, participants, evaluations, animateurs....
Cela touche:
- les horareM: parfois en fin de journee, apres la fatigue et les soucis du travail accompli,
en tenant compte pour un 'petit" chef d'entreprise de la necessite de mettre en route le travail
du matin et de revenir le soir pour controle et nouvelles directives ou consignes.
- la dg    deux heures en salle constituant un maximum pour des gens de terrain;
- Ies moyens: tableaux, panneaux, maquettes, films, diapos, etc...;
- la cadenc ou friguence, laissant le temps d'assimiler (preference aux formules de une ou
deux seances par semaine);
- le travail sur le tas - Aller sur le chantier d'un collegue puis en faire la critique etant plus
profitable (mais non traumatisant grace au talent de l'animateur) qu'un gdndralement releves
sur les chantiers;
- l'aide I I'application sur le lieu do travail.

Me'we pour les seances d'infonmation et les taches d'assistance technique mais
particulierement pour la "FORMATION", il conviendra de rester vigilant vis-a-vis des intervenants
et de leur mdthode pddagogique (d'ob l'intdret d'un expert en formation mattrisant aussi la

MISE EN OEUVRE
Pour rendre des entreprises aptes a maltriser des travaux, la stricte logique voudrait
qu'on le fasse dans une phase antriieuie A l'attribution de ces travaux.
Cette logique n'est pas applicable puisque, entre autres imperatifs, ce sont les
entreprises retenues qui bdndficieront de la formation.
On doit donc s'attendre a voir attribuer les premiers marchds aux entreprises les plus
avancees.
Les entreprises sdlectionnees, ou prd-s6lectionndes ou au moins ddtectees comme
potentiellement capables tireront profit de la formation pour les marches ulterieurs.
L'action IFAT sera donc lancee gn mOme =21 que le Projet TIPE, et tout de suite
de fagon intensive, avec une montee en puissance rapide d&s les six premiers mois. La gestion de
l'operation sera difficile, car plusieurs cycles simultanes se chevaucheront pour le seul volet
Formation, sans nuire au volet Information prealable et au volet Assistance Technique a mettre
rapidement en place.
L'apogee du volet IFAT se situera en deuxieme partie de la premiere annee. 11 se
poursuivra en regime de croisiere au cours de la deuxieme annEe. Il se poursuivra en rdgime de
croisiere au cours de la deuxitme annee, consacrde plus fortement I l'Assistance, tandis que se
preparera l'action de la troisieme annee, plus spdcialement devolue A la decentralisation, c'est-a-dire
en Province.

cycles pour personnel technico-admmnistratif et pour personnel exEcutant
Le temps ddvolu A la mission n'a pas perwis d'Etudier l'action possible en Province
mnoyens potentiels paraissant exister I Bobo-Dioulasso; actions d'ONG, missions, centres privds
dans d'autres villes et meme en milieu rural, dont les prestations pourraient etre mises I contribution.
On peut estimer que les cycles pour chefs d'entreprise et pour l'encadrement peuvent
aisement se d6centraliser, s'agissant de disposer d'une salle et de transporter du matdriel pddagogique.
Pour le personnel d'exEcution, il conviendra d'&Udier les structures d'appui possibles
(college technique, centre de Perfectionnement des artisans urbains I Bobo-Dioulasso, etc....)
La formule de "chantiers-Ecole" pourra se ddvelopper dans cette phase de
decentralisation, la rentabilitE de formation itindrante at autres camion-ateliers Eant douteuse.
Sur le plan quantitaif, on peut estimer trbs grossibrement k:
40 A 50 le nombre de chefs d'entreprises concerndes;
60 et 80 les chefs de chantier et chefs d'dquipe
100 et plus le personnel d'exEcution et le personnel technico-administratif
Ces chiffres seront I revoir et I actualiser en fonction du nombre de marchEs offerts et des rdactions
favorables I la suite des journdEs d'information.

Gestion el ReponsabilitE
La diversite, le chevauchement et l'intensitd de to ites ces actions appellent une
coordination, une "orchestration" au sein meme de l'Agence.
L'idde mattresse consiste & commander les actions de formation I des intervenants
agissant en sous-traitance.
En l'absence de structure d'appui extdrieure, la formule consiste A crder dans
l'Agence une 'cellule"IFAT, chargde d'administrer ce programme:
- planning des actions
- orientation des missions des assistants techniques internationaux et des consultants,
formateurs et assistants techniques nationaux
- coordination de leur action
- choix des intervenants
- lancement des actions
- contrOle de leur impact
- dvaluation et rdamenagements
- dtablissement des coats
- reglement des honoraires et vacations, etc.
11 semble qu'cn puisse se contenter d'une structure lEgere, avec un coordonnateur
appuyd par un expert international (pour deux ans) assistd d'un collaborateur et d'une secrdtaire.
La cellule tiendra la liaison avec le responsable de la communication.
Elle sera placde hors hidrarchie, sous l'autoritd du Directeur GEneral de l'Agence.
Contr6le - Evaluation - pErennitE
Hors l'impulsion que la cellule IFAT donnera I ce volet, son role essentiel est de
cQntr6Ie, sous les aspects:
- timing par rapport au ddroulement du Projet TIPE qu'il faudra suivre et savoir r
- addquation des actions aux lacunes rdelles des entreprises qu'elles sont sensdes combler
- quald des prestations des intervenants
- coats estimds et coats effectifs - analyse des ecarts - correctifs budgetaires.
Les visites frdquentes aux bdndficiaires, los rencontres en cours de formation, les
questionnaires d'dvaluation devront ouvrir la voie I des infldchissements des actions pour les ajuster
de mieux en mieux aux objectifs.
La cellule IFAT pourra ainsi concerter avec les intervenants et les bdneficiaires d-s
seances de reprise, des compldments aux cycles mends, voire le lancement d'actions non prdvues a
l'origine.

methodes utilisdes devraient, ayant montrd leur efricacitd, avoir valeur d'exemple et fre exploitds
dans d'autres secteurs.
Dans l'immediat ddjA, on sait qu'un schema voisin de ce programme est envisagE pour
le Projet Sectoriel de Transport.
Si une synchronisation s'avtre possible, certains dlements de l'Assistance pourraient
se combiner entre ces deux projets.
