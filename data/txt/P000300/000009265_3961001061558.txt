MEMORANDUM ANp REOOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BURKINA PASO
FMR A PUBLIC WOMKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed credit to Burkina Faso for the equivalent of US$20.3
million to help finance a project for public works and employment. The credit
would be on standard IDA torm with 40 years maturity. The Government of Burkina
Faso will contribute US$2.2 million ar 10 percent of the IDA Credit.
2.          Backgzond. Burkina Faso's record for the decade of the 1980s is one
of upheavals. The country has known two coups d'dtat and one attempted coup in
that decade.   The socio-political unrest,  coupled with drought, rainfall
fluctuations, and the fall in world market prices for its main agricultural
export commodities (cotton and groundnut oil) have contributed to reduce its
competitiveness.   For example, between 1972 and 1989, Burkina Faso saw a
50 percent decline in its terms of trade.
3.          Meantime, Burkina Faso's economic structure underwent some changes
during the 1980s, indicating the diminution of agriculture and the rise of
services. In 1980, agriculture contributed 39.9 percent to GDP while industry
and services contributed 18.8 percent and 36.4 percent respectively. In 1990,
it has been estimated that agriculture constituted 30 percent of GDP while
industry and services contributed respectively 23 and 42 percent. Also, the
financial crisis has reduced investments in urban areas while the diminishing
contribution of agriculture has reinforced rural-urban migration. With higher
population growth and a small modern sector, the social effects of the crisis
have been the most visible at the urban level.
4.          According to the last population census of 1985, Burkina Faso has a
population of 8.3 million representing an average density of 30 persons per
square kilometer as compared to 20 in 1975. It has been estimated that by the
year 2000, Burkina Faso will have a population of 12 million. The population of
Burkina Paso is very young.   Forty-five percent is lses  than 45 years old,
52 percent is between 15 and 64 years old and 3 percent ts over 65 years old.
The bulk of the labor force, estimated at about 3.8 million, works in agriculture
(82 percent), industry (13 percent), and services (5 percent).   In the past
30 years (1960-1990), there has been a small increase in birth rates (from 49 to
51 percent), a marked decrease in death rates (from 32 to 19 percent), and an
increase in life expectancy (from 32 to 48 years).
5.          The average informal sector worker is young and has little education.
According to the 1987 survey done by the Office National de la Promotion de
l'mploi (ONPl) in ouagadoagou, 60 percent of these workers are between 20 and
40 years old.   Eighty percent of informal sector workers are illiterate,
15 percent have completed primary school,  and 3.7 percent have completed
secondary school.    Eighty-two percent declared themselves  self-employed,
8 percent are in an apprenticeship program, and 4 percent are employers. There
exists a great deal of labor mobility in the informal sector but the group of
"employerw is made up of those who declared that they have been working for more
than five years in their present activity.
6.          A high population growth rate of 3.3 percent and intense rural-urban
migration have dramatically increased urbanization in the 1980s. The capital
city, Ouagadougou, which had a small population of 276,000 in 1980, has more than
doubled in population, reaching 600,000 in 1990. This population represents
40 percent of the urban population.   Bobo-Dioulasso, the other large urban
agglomeration, accounts for another 25 percent of the urban population and has
seon its population increase to 300,000 since 1980. The labor force growth of
these urban areas has not been matched by job creation. For a long time, the
traditional outlet for the youngest strata of the urban population has been
emigration to neighboring C6te d'Ivoire and Ghana.    These workers  sent



-2-
remittances equalling 6 percent of GDO for the 1986-1990 period.
7.          The unemployment situation in the urban areas o! Burkina Faso li very
acute. The two traditional o-itlets for demand of labor (secondary private sector
and public sector) are unable to satisfy the flow of new entrants to the labor
market. The modern sector of light industries is not labor-intensive and does
not create many jobs, while the public sector is saturated. According to a
survey of the labor markets in the three largest cities (Ouagadougou, Bobo-
Dioulasso, and Koudougou), carried out by ONPI in 1987, there were 31,974 demands
for only 5,470 offers or a coverage ratio of demand to supply of 17 percent. The
situation was worse 'n Ouafadougou where for a total of 22,147 demands there were
only 3,288 offers, or a coverage ratio of 14.8 percent. since then, things have
worsened due to intense rural-urban migration. The ONPE survey indicates that
compared to a total of 50,089 informal sector workers identified in Ouagadougou,
there were only 28,000 civil service employees, while the modern private sector
had 23,570 employees.
8.          Urban unemployment has been rising,  especially as the policy
environment has not been conducive to private investment and output growth
because of too many regulations and controls hindering productive activity.
Estimated unemployment figures range from 11 to 25 percent, depending on whether
or not the informal sector is taken into consideration in the methodology used
for the calculations. Urban unemployment is further aggravated by the return of
many former emigrants. The possibilities of the emigration safety valve for
Burkina Paso to neighboring C8te d I Ivoire and Ghana are dwindling. The recession
in those countries has led to the return of many migrants to urban areas and to
a drop in the level of remittances from US$19' million in 1986 to USS164 million
in 1990. This last level of annual remittances for 1990 remains significant as
it exceeds the combined earnings from cotton, gold and livestock exports
aetimated at US$130 million annually.
9.         pRationale for IDA Involvement.  The Government of Burkina Paso is
facing a serious fiscal deficit that is straining its public investment capacity.
In order to improve this situation, it has committed itself to apply a series of
measures and carry out certain reforms to correct the external and internal
imbalances. While preparing a structural adjustment program whose aim is to
Improve public sector resource management, the Government approached IDA to
undertake a program of small urban infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation
works that would complement the more extensive works being carried out under the
Second Urban Project. Municipalities have a whole list of projects ranging from
street paving, road maintenance, drainage rehabilitation, refurbishing schools
and clinics, etc., that cannot be funded because of the diminution of public
investment brought by the austerity resulting from the economic crisis. While
having a long-term beneficial impact on economic growth, the execution of these
needed urban works will also contribute in the short term to emplcyment creation
in the construction-related trades. Because the project provides the opportunity
for the private sector to grow and to demonstrate its capacity to implement
efficiently and effectively public programs, it will support the reforms that are
being undertaken at the macro level. IDA knows the urban sector and, building
on its experience in similar projects in Senegal and Niger, can help the
Government to support the municipalities to achieve their primary task of
cleaning and maintaining roads and drainage systems, collecting garbage, building
and rehabilitating schools, dispensaries, and other small economic and social
infrastructure.
10.         2roioct Obiectives.  The wain objectives of the project aret (a) to
finance a program of small municipal works in the area of urban infrastructure
upgrading and rehabilitation; (b) to promote local private contractors and
consulting firms in project execution; (c) to improve, through execution of the
works financed by the project, the individual skills of the workers who will be
employed and the corporate competitiveneLJ of the firms that will carry out works



so an to develop their capacity to respond to increased opportunltLos for
sustained employment after completion of the project; (4) to create, at least
temporarlly, substantial new employment in urban area. as rapidly as possible
using tho private sector, thereby stimulating small local prLvate contractors and
consultLng firms (e) to revLow exlstlng public works programs and recant them
wlth the lntent of speedlng up theLr implemntatLon and overall performancel and
(f) to demonstrate the foeasblilty of labor-intensive projects and test the
p.:ocedures that will ensure the publie sector's abilLty to commLisson such
projects.
11.         Proin2t DescrLtLon. The components of the proposed project are:
(a) a program of public facility and infrastructure rehabilltation and
maLntenance in urban areas to be carried out under labor-lntensive achemes by
local contractors; (b) a package of servicee related to work organization,
management, and labor force training to be offered on a voluntary basis to the
local contractors who wlll be awarded contracts under component (a); (c) a
supervLoLon and monltorlng component ln order to closely monitor the progress of
the project and to prepare the transltlon toward locally supported employment of
the target group; (d) a selective audit of public works programs to LdentLfy
bottlenecks and design system Lmprovementsl and (e) a package of consultant
services related to a training program for the beneficiaries and engineerLng
firms on the preparation of feasLbility studLes and technical project proposals;
and a program aimed at increasing grassroots participation in urban
infrastructure maintenance. This is an innovative component aimed at increasing
the uommitaent of neighborhood residents to the Lnfrastructure that is beLng
rehabllitated in thelr immediate envlronment. Thls will facliLtate the future
maintenance of the facilltLes.
12.        Aareed Actions.  The Executing Agency wlll be created prlor to
effectiveness. Its statutes and bylaws were discussed and approved during
negotiations. Also durlng negotiations, agreements with the Government were
reached on the detailed operational guidelines of the agency, including, Later
alJa, the *ligibility criterla of the subprojects to be included ln the program
and the procurement procedures. The followLng actiong, aimed at enuring rapid
start-up of the project, are conditions of effectivenest  (a) the ExecutLng
Agency will be staffed by a Director General, a Technical Director, and a
Financial Dlrector with qualLfications and experlence acceptable to the
Association; (b) the Executing Agency shall have selected a flret-year program
of subprojects whose aggregate estimated cost is equlvalent to US$4.8 m$illon or
more, and the Assoclation shall have approved the selectLon of such subprojects;
(c) a Convention has been signed by the Borrower and the Executing Agency; (d)
the Executing Agency has prequalified an initial list of enterprLses and
*       engineering flrms; and (e) the ExecutLng Agency has set up an operatlonal
accountLng system and has selected audltore acceptable to the Assoclation, and
(f) has submitted for approval to IDA the traLning program for the beneficLarLes
and engLneering firms.
13.        Snnvironmental Aaiectn . Works to be financed under the project will
be small and scattered and their cumulative impact on the physical environment
is expected to be minor. Many of the ellglble subprojects, both works and
servicees, will have a net positive impact on the urban envlronment. Thli is
partlcularly true of subprojects such as soil and water conservatLon works,
drainage improvements and torracing, sanitation improvements, plantlng and park
works, and solld waste collection. All subprojects will be consistent wlth the
strategic Agenda for Improving Urban Living Conditlons that will be executed
under the soon to be completed Surkina Faso Natlonal EnvLronmental Action Plan.
The project is claseLfLed as Category C.
14.        *efLdta. The project wlll assLit municipalities and "collectLvit6s
locale" to carry out useful investments ln the rehabLiltation and maintenance
of public infrastructure.  These inventments either wlll have satLifactory



- 4 -
ecoomic rates of return (estimated at 12%) for road reconstruction and 27% for
drainage canals) or, in the case of social infrastructure such as schools and
clinics, will constLtute least-cost construction solutions. It will help the
private sector, especially the amll firms in construction-related industries
that will be engaged to execute the works. It will create employment as these
firms will hire laborers and technicians to fulfill their contracts. It wlll
promote the local engineering and architectural consulting industry which will
provide subproject design and supervision servico. The project will also help
the Government in the area of contract management. It will demonstrate the
effleiency of private sector approaches and procedures in public works
management. The ultimate direct beneficiaries will be the low-paid temporary
workers in the building and construction trades.
15.         Riskg. The main risks arise from the possible inability of Burkina
Paso's economy to develop enough stable job opportunities at the and of the
project period, leading to pressure from tho Government to extend the project
beyond its initial three years.  This risk cannot be addressed within the
proposed project but should be alleviated if the ongoing adjustment program is
implemented successfully. The risk will also be reduced by the development of
stable infrastructure maintenance programs that are being developed under Bank-
supported urban and transport projects. Another risk is that there might be
pressure for continued employment for those who would benefit from the program
to take the form of their being hired by local governments when the program ends.
Such continuation of employment would jeopardizse efforts of public sector
management improvement, including restrictions on personnel hiring, implemented
during the recent years by the central and local governments. Lastly, the
control of proper use of funds is more difficult with such a program than with
regular investment projects. The implementing arrangemeto established during
project preparation and appraisal and contained in a Procedures Manual, have been
carefully designed to address this risk. As a result, project selection will be
carried out according to economic criteria and approved by the Association.
Pinancial management will be closely monitored through six-monthly audits of the
Agency's operations.
16.         Recommendatin  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
