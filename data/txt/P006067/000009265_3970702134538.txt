MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
FOR A NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND WATER SUPPLY ANID
SEWERAGE REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Water and Sewerage
Corporation of The Bahamas for the equivalent of US$10.0 million is submitted
for approval.  The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of The
Bahamas and would have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB),
the European Investment Bank (EIB) and ttc. National Insurance Board (NIB) of The
Bahamas would co-finance the project.
Background.
2.        About 90% of the population of New Providence Island is adequately
serviced by water supply, as a result of major water infrastructure improvements
undertaken in the past lecade in meeting tourism and household demands.
Currently the total water production capacity is about 6.5 million imperial
gallons per day (MIGD). Sewerage service is limited to the Nassau area and only
about 12% of the population of New Providence are connected to the sewerage
system. The remaining population uses on-plot disposal devices, including
septic tanks which, because of the high water table, could contaminate the
ground water. Water quality is also jeopardized by high salinity caused by
overabstraction of the well fields. Both the water supply and sewerage.systems
are very old and, because of inadequate maintenance, are in need of repairs or
replacements. Furthermore, unaccounted-for water is estimated at 46%, which is
high; equally high are the water rates (average US$10.97 per 1000 imperial
gallons in 1985).
3.        The water supply and sewerage sector is under the responsibility qf
the Ministry of Works and Utilities (MOWU), which, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), formulates national sectoral policies.  In
1976 the Government established the Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) to
replace the Water Supply and Sewerage Department in the MOWU. Its present
responsibilities are limited to providing services on New Providence Island. It
has currently a staff of about 331. In 1976 the Bank made a loan of US$10.0
million to WSC (Loan 1320-BM) for water supply and sewerage development. The
project was co-financed by CDB and local commercial banks. The project had as
its goals: to alleviate the water shortage in New Providence, and to help
develop WSC during its formative stages. It was completed in 1982, about three
years behind schedule, principally because of delays in initial project
execution while the newly established corporation was being organized, and
delays in the award of contracts due to modifications in the project design.
The project was nevertheless successful in relieving the chronic water shortages
which threatened the vital tourism sector, and in bringing about substantial
improvements in WSC's organization and operations. Nevertheless, WSC still has
institutional shortcomings which will be addressed by the proposed project.
4.        Project Objectives.  The main objective of the proposed project would
be to continue to improve WSC in the key areas of management and finance and to
promote system reliability and performance through the rehabilitation of
deteriorating facilities and by improvements in their operation and maintenance.

5.        Project Description.  The project, to be carried out over eight years,
would have the following major components:
Part A. Water supply tehabilitation through:
(i) rehabilitation and improved operation of well fields in New
Providence; (ii) relining or replacement of transmission and
distribution pipes; (iii) installation of new mains, and (iv) related
engineering services.
Part B.  Water importation improvements through:
(i) reconstruction of a seawall and repairs to the loading dock at.
Morgans Bluff on Andros Island; (ii) rehabilitation and improved
extraction of water from Andros Island well fields; (iii) replacement
of the fendering system at the Arawak Cay terminal in New Providence
and provision of an additional storage facility; and (iv) related
engineering services.
Part C. Sewerage rehabilitation through:
(i) replacement of sewers in downtown Nassau; (ii) conversion of a
malfunctioning vacuum sewerage system in two housing subdivisions;
(iii) improvements to sewage disposal facilities; and (iv) related
engineering services.
Part D. Acquisition of various equipment including meters,
construction and maintenance equipment, and installation of telemetry
and controls at pumping stations.
Part E. A comprehensive progiam of technical assistance and training.
This program will help bring about in the near term further
improvements in WSC's corporate structure and management, which should
lead to increased efficiency in the provision of the corporation's
services, as well as provide the basis for long-term resource and
environmental planning. The program would include, inter alia,
institutional rehabilitation, operational improvements covering
commercial, engineering, and maintenance functions of WSC, the
formulation and implementation of an adequate tariff structure, the
reduction of the unaccounted-for water in the system, and sector
development studies including development of strategies to meet the
medium- and long-term water demand of New Providence, as well as the
development of an action plan to guide sewerage system construction in
the medium term.
6.        The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$33.5 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$21.4 million (64Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule
are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in The Bahamas are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Three maps showing project locations are also attached. The
staff appraisal report, No. 6156 b - BM dated September 22, 1986, is being
distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project objectives are
consistent with the Bank's strategy to assist The Bahamas in developing its
manpower skills and in addressing critical institutional and developmental
issues in key sectors of the economy. A well-functioning water supply and



-3-
sewerage system is vital to the health of the populatiorn and of the tourism
industry, on which the economy of The Bahamas is critically dependent.
8.        Agreed Actions.  To ensure that the proposed project will be
implemented efficiently, WSC has agreed to maintain competent personnel at the
project implementation unit. In addition, the Government has agreed to provide
US$11.0 million in equity funds to WSC in a timely manner to help meet the cost
of the project. To implement programs for the strengthening of its management
and operation, WSC will complete studies, discuss the findings and
recommendations with the Bank and present action plans for implementation of
agreed recommendations as follows:  (a) management audit by June 1987; (b)
commercial and engineering operations by March 1988; (c) tariff study and
unaccounted-for water program by May 1987; and (d) shipping performance and
monitoring program annually not later than October 31.  The water and sewerage
sector studies are scheduled to be completed by early 1989. To ensure WSC's
continued financial viability, it has agreed to: (i) maintain a financial
working ratio of not more than 75%, and not incur additional long-term debt
unless it has a debt service coverage of at least 1.5; (ii) reassess its
financial and operational performance annually and, in consultation with the
Bank, propose measures to meet the agreed financial covenants and perforamance
targets; and (iii) consult with the Bank before expanding its service area.
9.        Justification.  The benefits under the proposed project would
accrue from increased efficiency and resulting cost savings, as well as improved
quality of water and better water supply and sewerage service. The project
would also contribute to a cleaner environment and help prevent the outbreak of
waterborne diseases. Most of the New Providence population served by WSC would
benefit from the project. By 1994, an additional resident population of about
51,000 would share the project's benefits, an increase in coverage from 90% to
94% as a result of the physical improvements and expansions to be undertaken
under the project. The proportion of the urban poor with access to safe water -
through direct connections is expected to increase from 49% in 1986 to about 78%
by project completion. Due to the nature of the project not all of the benefits
can be quantified reliably. However, based on the estimated cost savings
resulting from the increase in efficiency and better system management, the
project would have an indicative economic rate of return of about 15%.
10.       Risks.  The main project risk lies In the multiplicity of project
activities, and in WSC's ability to absorb and implement in a timely manner the
results of the various technical assistance studies. Without a timely follow up
the projected cost savings would not be realized. This risk should not be
overrated however, considering the commitment of WSC's top management to the
project objectives. Project risks would also be reduced by consultant
assistance, training, and annual reviews between WSC and the Bank.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Dtrectors approve the proposed loan.

Country Brief
(for circulation with
Report No.P-4388-BM
COMMONWEALTH OF THE BAHAMAS
I. THE ECONOMY
1.       A country economic report entitled "The Commonwealth of The
Bahamas Economic Report" (Report No. 6027-BM, dated March 24, 1986) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on April 1, 1986. The attached
Annex contains the basic country data.
Recent Economic Developments
2.       Historically, the economic fortunes of The Bahamas have been
significantly influenced by political and economic events in Europe and the
United States. The economy is an open one, with a strong service sector
orientation, reflecting the country's geographic position and lack of
significant natural resources. Since the widespread advent of air travel
in the 1930s, the country has entered into its most sustained period of
economic development, based upon a fuller exploitation of the country's
tourism potential.
3.       At present, tourism accounts, directly and indirectly, for about
35% of GDP, and provides employment for over 40% of the working population.
Tourism promotion has been vigorous, with considerable Government resources
devoted to what has become a very sophisticated tourism marketing effort.
To this development has been added, since the early 1960s, successful
creation of an international finance center, taking advantage of taxation
and foreign capital movements legislation introduced in the United States
and Europe. This sector employs about 900 workers; its contribution in
local expenditures in 1983 was in excess of B$40 million. Foreign
investment has played a crucial role in the country's economic de-elopment,
particularly during the 1960s, when GDP growth averaged 9.0% per arnum. It
has been estimated that during this period, direct private foreign
investment, excluding the financial sector, exceeded one billion US$, most
of which was in the tourist sector, although there have also been some
significant investments in petroleum refining and manufacturing,
particularly chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
4.       The robust economic performance recorded in the 1960s was not
followed in the 1970s for a variety of reasons. Economic recession abroad,
particularly with regard to the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, and
temporary uncertainties occasioned by the attainment of independence in
1973, served to reduce investment in the country's leading sectors.
Nevertheless, by the end of the decade, the economy had recovered rapidly,
led by strong growth in tourism from the United States and renewed growth
in construction activity, both residential and in the tourism sectors. The
number of stopover visitors rose sharply by 22% in 1978 and by 14% in 1979,



2-
-1
which undoubtedly influenced investor expectations with a doubling of
construction starts in 1978 and again in 1979. This recovery continued in
the 1980s, with real GDP growth of 7.51, 3.2% and 6.41 in 1982, 1983 and
1984, respectively.
5.       While tourism is the predominant sector, there have been important
developments in other sectors as well. In addition to the financial sector
(para. 4), the Government attaches considerable importance to an expansion
of domestic agriculture; however, the various programs introduced over the
past decade have had mixed results. Total agricultural and fishing
activities still account for less than 5% of GDP, and only about 101 of the
acreage that is suitable for tillage is at present being utilized. A
variety of impediments inhibit this sector's growth. Local labor is
expensive and scarce, domestic marketing arrangements are deficient, and
policies with regard to foreign investment in the sector are unclear. The
manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 10% of GDP, is mostly of the
enclave-type and is concentrated in Grand Bahama. The Government is
endeavoring to expand the sector and has recently established a Free Zone
in New Providence.
6.       The impact of the recent economic growth on employment is
difficult to judge. Employment information in The Bahamas is deficient, as
the last year in which a labor force survey was conducted was in 1979. The
unemployment rate at that time was estimated at 14.3%, with a labor force
participation rate of 45.9%. It has been estimated that employment during
1980-84 has increased at an average annual rate of about 4%, which (when
compared to a rate of population increase of 2.1% per annum) suggests that
substantial progress has been made in the reduction of unemployment.
Overall, employment growth has been most rapid in the hotel sector,
although there was also a substantial rise in Government employment in 1981
and 1982. In general, wage rates in The Bahamas are high, when compared to
other paucs of the Caribbean, and in many categories are similar to those
which prevail in the United States, particularly the Southeast. However,
given the lack of any progressive personal income tax, the distribution of
wage income may be somewhat more skewed. The economy continues to suffer
labor shortages in certain critical areas, including artisans in the
building industry, qualified accounting personnel, professional and
technical personnel, particularly in computer services and automobile
repair. There has been immigration from other Caribbean countries,
particularly from Haiti, which tends to add to the or-orkforce at the lower
skill and wage levels, although the precise number of these immigrants is
not known.
7.       Following a relatively high inflationary period from 1977 to mid-
1981, prices have steadily declined in The Bahamas, tending to closely
follow those of the United States, the country's principal trading partner.
After declining to an annual rate of 2.8% in mid-1984, the pace of annual
price rises increased during the second half of the year to 4.5%.
Inflation remained moderate in 1985. The largest fall in price inflation
has been in the food category, most of which is imported from the
southeastern United States. The rate of decline of consumer durable and
non-durable price rises has not been as great and may, in part, reflect
high concentration within the import and distribution sectors, which in
turn may have impeded the "passing on" of the price moderation in imported
goods.



-3-
Balance of Payments
8.       The nominal value of the Bahamian dollar is maintained at par with
the United States dollar. As a result, the nominal effective exchange rate
of The Bahamas has appreciated significantly over the past four years (1981
to 1985), reflecting the rise in the United States dollar. Over this
period, the real effective rate of the Bahamian dollar (utilizing relative
consumer price indices) is estimated to have appreciated by 27%. Since the
latter part of 1985, however, this appreciation trend has reversed.
Despite this long period of appreciation, the current account and resource
balances have improved continually since 1981. In 1983, the current
account balance became positive for the first time in five years and
reached 1.4% of GDP in 1984. This general improvement is a result of a
substantial improvement in merchandise exports in 1982 (25.8% increase) due
to rapid growth in the pharmaceutical industry in Grand Bahama and an
increase in exports of alcoholic beverages. In 1983 and 1984, the further
improvement in the current account balance was due to the rapid growth in
tourism receipts, reflecting the robust economic growth in the United
States. This growth in tourism receipts has more than offset the rise in
imports due to the growth in domestic economic activity.
9.       The balance of payments of The Bahamas exhibits a number of
characteristics that are common to the region. First, The Bahamas has
historically exhibited large negative trade balances, counteracted by large
net inflows on the service account as a result of tourism revenues.
Second, the large amount of foreign investment that has occurred,
particularly in the development of the tourism sector, has meant that
factor service payments and investment income paid abroad have been large,
averaging 10.2% of GDP over the past eight years. As a result, the current
account, and the resource balance, is subject to significant short run
volatility following the volatility of tourism visitor arrivals and
investor expectations. Furthermore, while import levels will adjust to
lower economic activity, they tend to do so with an appreciable lag.
Consequently, considerable emphasis is placed by the Central Bank on
monitoring and control of the balance of payments. In particular,
considerable attention is directed at domestic credit creation and the
consumer credit component of this. This policy emphasis is necessary,
given the openness of the economy and the lack of fiscal policy instruments
that may serve to depress demand during periods of lower foreign earnings.
Public Sector Finances, Public Debt
10.      The consolidated financial position of the public sector has
improved since 1982. The overall deficit of the public sector declined
from B$68.0 million (5% of GDP) in 1984 to BS46.0 million in 1983 and to a
surplus of B$51.0 million (3% of GDP) in 1984. This improved performance
reflects four developments: (i) reduced capital expenditures following the
completion of major hotel construction projects; (ii) a significant
improvement in the performance of the non-financial public corporati6ns;
(iii) modest growth in current expenditures; and (iv) buoyant tax revenues,
particularly from duties relating to imports for the tourism sector. The
1985 budget indicated a continued improvement in public savings to reach
$37.0 million (a 38.8% improvement over 1984). However, due to increased
capital expenditures, particularly by the Central Government in public
works, education and health, the overall surplus is expected to decline.



-4-
This budget reflects further moderation in the rate of growth of current
expenditures and a 22% increase in current revenues due to a variety of
new measures included in the budget. These measures included a 2.5%
increase in basic customs duties (excluding basic foodstuffs); an increase
of 5 cents per gallon in the tax on gasoline; and increased user fees at
airports and hospitals. In addition, improved administration and tax
collection efforts are expected to increase the revenue yield of the
existing tax structure. Indications by mid-1985 suggest, however, that the
planned increase in revenue collections may have been optimistic, and
current and overall surpluses are expected to be smaller. To some extent,
this shortfall will be compensated by lower capital expenditures, which, at
B$102.0 million, represented an ambitious program, particularly for the
Central Government portion of the total.
11.      Substantial progress has been made by the Government in the
provision of health care and education over the past decade. Expenditure
on education rose from about 11Z of Government expenditure in 1955, to a
peak of 25% in 1974, declining to about 17% in 1984. In the early 1970s, a
large expansion of secondary schools and teacher accommodations occurred in
the Family Islands,1 which substantially improved the availability of
education to poorer sections of the community. Furthermore, there has been
a steady decline in the student-to-teacher ratio, which, for the system as
a whole, was 34 to 1 in 1976 and 21 to 1 in 1983. Despite this improvement
in coverage of the educational system, the quality of the system requires
further enhancement. With regard to health care, life expectancy has
consistently improved and the crude death rate declined form 6.5 per 1,000
in 1970 to 5.0 per 1,000 in 1980. Available hospital beds and medical
personnel/patient ratios have steadily improved over the last decade and a
comprehensive system of child innoculation had achieved in excess of 902
coverage by 1985.
12.      Total foreign currency debt of the public sector increased by
nearly US$130.0 million in 1981 and 1982, primarily as a result of two
loans to finance a large hotel-casino complex for the Government-owned
Hotel Corporation. As a result of this 127% increase, total foreign debt
stood at 16.25% of GDP at the end of 1982. However, as the hotel project
approached completion in 1983, new foreign borrowing by the pablic sector
was reduced and, by the end of 1984, total debt outstanding had declined by
9.1% to US$209.3 million, or 12.3% of GDP. A major factor in this decline
was large principal payments on outstanding obligations by the public
sector corporations. In particular, the Electricity Corporation repaid
over US$15.0 million, about US$10.0 million of which was ahead of schedule
as a result of a significantly improved cash flow position. Historically,
the external debt service ratio of The Bahamas has been very low by
international standards, fluctuating between 3% and 6% of exports of goods
and services, and at about 8% to 10% of Government revenues. The large
borrowings in 1981 and 1982 have not, as yet, changed this situation,
although there will be a more significant burden in 1986 and 1987 as the
Government begins repayment of the debt incurred on behalf of the Hotel

(pop. 135,000) and the Grand Bahama (pop. 25,000), that form the
archipelago of The Bahamas. The four largest among these islands are
Eleuthera (pop. 9,470), Andros (pop. 8,845), Abaco (pop. 6,500) and
Long Island (pop. 3,860).

Corporation, with debt service payments rising to US$62.0 million and
US$57.0 million, respectively. Nevertheless, given the strong economic
performance recorded in 1985, no extraordinary difficulty is to be expected
and the overall debt service ratio should increase only marginally in these
two years.
Development Issues, Growth Prospects
13.      Notwithstanding these positive economic achievements, there are a
number of significant difficulties. Economic growth and development has
not been uniformly distributed throughout the country, with most of the
advances being made in New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. As a
result, migration, particularly to New Providence (Nassau), has caused
social and infrastructural difficulties. Furthermore, the very open nature
of the economy, together with the strong reliance on one major sector
(tourism), has made the economy vulnerable and imparts a strong volatility
to economic performance on a year to year basis. This overall
vulnerability is recognized by the Government, and a variety of initiatives
have been undertaken over the past decade to diversify the country's one-
sector dependency. While these efforts may serve to reduce this volatility
in the long term, in the interim considerable vigilance is necessary,
particularly with regard to developments in the balance of payments and the
expansion of domestic credit. in this context, medium term economic policy
may be broken into four broad objectives. First, there is a need to ensure
that the cost competitiveness of the country's leading sectors is not
eroded. This will require continued efforts to moderate wage demands and
to encourage efficiency improvements in both the distribution system and
the provision of utility services. Second, greater attention needs to be
focused upon the regional distribution of future growth. The
infrastructure needs and economic opportunities available in the Family
Islands require special attention. Third, given the high percentage of the
population under sixteen years of age, and the projected volume of school
leavers, appropriate job creation still remains a high priority. Finally,
given the increasing sophistication of the economy, the operating
efficiency of the whole public sector will require continued upgrading.
Administrative procedures need to become less time-consuming, with enhanced
interactions between the various components of Government, especially as it
relates to foreign investment.
14.      The general outlook for the Bahamian economy remains quite
positive, largely on the basis of the projected growth in tourism (stopover
visitors). This growth will depend largely upon the growth in the United
States economy and, given estimates for this growth and historic
elasticities, it is projected that the Bahamian economy should grow by an
annual average rate of about 4.0% over the next five years. From 1990
onwards, there should be a steady rise in net external reserves, reaching
the equivalent of 12.1 weeks of imports by 1995, from a low of 6.4 weeks in
1983. Such an improvement in the reserve position, however, will depend,
i-n part, upon the flow of public and private capital. The latter has
exhibited considerable volatility in the past. If the various Central
Government revenue enhancement measures bear fruit, public sector
performance should continue to improve, with a positive Central Government
current account balance rising to 2.3% of GDP by 1990, and remaining at
this level thereafter. Given known Government investment plans, external
debt is expected to remain quite modest, at about 2.8% of GDP by 1995, with

very low external debt service of about 0.5% of exports of goods and non-
factor services.
II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.      The Bahamas joined the Bank in 1973.  Since then, it has received
three Bank loans in a total amount of US$22.8 million. Given that most of
the financing requirements of the country could be met by other sources,
Bank lending emphasized less a transfer of resources than addressing
critical institutional bottlenecks which impeded the development process.
Thus, the Bank's lending operations focussed on helping development of
manpower skills and strengthening of major developmental institutions in
key sectors of the economy.
16.      The first Bank loan of US$10 million in The Bahamas was for a
Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 1320-BM), approved by the Executive
Directors in July 1976. The project was designed to alleviate New
Providence Island's severe water shortage and sewerage problems (through
barging of water to New Providence from the neighboring Andros Island), and
to strengthen (operationally and financially) the Government's newly
created Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) as a strong and effective
sectoral institution. Despite some delays in its completion (and some
design changes), the project was successful in relieving New Providence
Island's chronic water supply shortages and the WSC has become a much
improved organization. Nevertheless, this vitally important sector still
has serious shortcomings and the proposed fourth Bank lending in The
Bahamas for the New Providence Island Water Supply and Sewerage
Rehabilitation Project would continue the Bank's assistance in this sector,
including further institutional development of the WSC.
17.      The second Bank loan of US$7.0 million was made for a Vocational
and Technical Education Project (Loan 1962-BH), approved in March 1981. It
included financing for an industrial training center, 12 senior high
schools, the College of the Bahamas, a hotel training college, and
technical assistance. While some project components have been completed,
or are near completion, the execution of the project as a whole has been
delayed by about one year, compared with the appraisal estimate. When
completed, the project will contribute significantly to the development of
vocational and technical manpower in the country.
18.      The third Bank loan of US$5.8 million was for an urban development
project (Loan 2089-EM), approved in February 1982. The project included
slum upgrading at the Grants Town location adjacent to Nassau, together
with helping the Bahamas Agricultural and Industrial Corporation to carry
out its task of promoting The Bahamas as a desirable location for
industrial investment (a part of the Government's policy of economic
diversification). Under the slum upgrading component, inrvision was made
for housing, urban public services, community facilities and technical
assistance. The industrial promotion component included technical
assistance, start-up costs, training and industrial park upgrading. While
the implementation of the industrial component has been on schedule, the
execution of the slum upgrading component has been slow, mainly due to
difficulties of coordination among the various ministries concerned and to
delays in land acquisition.

19.      In addltion to direct Bank lending, The Bahamas has benefited from
the Bank's lending to the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). Out of Bank
loan proceeds, CDB made two loans to The Bahamas, one in 1979 in an amount
of US$2.3 million and the other in 1986 in an amount of US$2.0 million,
both to The Bahamas Development Bank for agricultural/industrial credit.
20.      The Bank, through its economic reviews, has maintained its
dialogue with the Government on matters concerning economic policies and
development priorities. Under the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in
Economic Development (CGCED), it has also convened informal meetings of
multilateral donors for discussion of The Bahamas' financial and technical
assistance requirements. While the country's overall development strategy
and development policies are basically sound, its developmental
institutions, which are relatively young, need further strengthening and
could benefit from the Bank's technical guidance through project financing
and technical assistance. In early 1984, the Bank approved a graduation
program for The Bahamas (R-84-31, dated February 13, 1984) which provides
for a phase-out period for Bank lending from FY85 through FY88, with a
lending program of two projects involving total commitments of US$20
million and technical assistance in selected areas to be identified. The
Bank's graduation strategy has been discussed with the Government, which
indicated that it accepts, in general, this strategy, but that it would
have liked to receive a larger amount of assistance from the Bank during
the phase-out period than indicated above. We felt that the commitment
limit should not be altered at that time. The Government also wanted to
consider further the sectors in which Bank assistance would be most useful.
Subsequent to this, it was agreed with the Government that the two projects
to be financed by the Bank would consist of the proposed New Providence
Island Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation project, and a New
Providence port development project.  Recently, the Government requested
that Bank financial assistance be provided for a second education project
instead of the port project.
