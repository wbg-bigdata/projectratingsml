INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED CREDITS
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FlOR
THE DACCA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT AND
THE CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on proposed
development credits in amounts in various currencies equivalent to US$13.2
million and US$7.0 million respectively to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,
on standard IDA terms, to help finance the Dacca Water Supply and Sewerage
Project and the Chittagong Water Supply Project. These Credits would
replace credits of the same amounts (net of cancellations) to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan for the same projects (Credits Nos. 41-PAK and 42-PAK
of August 1963) on the basis set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of my Report and
Recommendation to the Executive Directors dated September 15, 1972 on the
Second Chandpur Irrigation Project (IDA/R 72-77).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
(dated September 25, 1972) was circulated on October 13, 1972 (R72-230).
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        The operations of the Bank Group in Bangladesh are described in
Part II of my Report and Recommendation referred to above. Since that
report, we have signed agreements with Bangladesh for a US$50 million
reconstruction imports program credit and five credits totalling US$62.3
million replacing amounts included in previous credits to Pakistan for the
same projects. Annex II gtves the status of Bank Group Operations in
Bangladesh.
PART III - THE PROJECTS
4.        The proposed credits would help finance improvements in water
supply and sewerage services in Dacca, the capital of Bangladesh with an
estimated population of close to 1 million, and water supply services in
Chittagong, which is the principal port of Bangladesh and a developing
industrial center, with an estimated population of 550,000. Credits Nos.
41-PAK for US$26 million equivalent and 42-PAN for US$24 million equivalent
were made on August 16, 1963 to help finance water and sewerage projects in
Dacca and Chittagong respectively. Due to difficulties in project execution



and higher than expected costs, it was agreed with the Government that
the original projects had been too ambitious, and in 1969 the projects
were revised and the credit amounts were reduced to US$13.2 million for
Dacca and US$7.0 million for Chittagong. The reductions in credit amounts
were mainly due to the utilization of ground water instead of developing
more expensive river water sources, together with a more gradual rate of
expansion of water and sewerage services in Dacca, and the reduction in
size of the surface water treatment and pumping facilities and the elimina-
tion of the sewerage component in Chittagong. Construction of facilities
included in the revised projects proceeded reasonably well until 1971 when
implementation was impeded by the disturbances which culminated in the
emergence of an independent ]3angladesh. The Government has now requested
new credits of US$13.2 million for Dacca and US$7.0 million for Chittagong
to reactivate these projects. In July 1972 a mission visited Bangladesh
to reappraise these projects,, and project summaries, as well as technical
notes describing the findings concerning the Dacca and Chittagong projects,
are attached as Annexes III, IV, V and VI, respectively.
5.        The principal works included in the water portion of the Dacca
Project as revised in 1969 were 26 tubewells, improvements in an existing
surface water treatment plant to double its capacity, 114 miles of water
distribution piping, 3 or 4 1.0 IMg elevated water storage tanks, 15,000
to 20,000 new water connections, 21,000 to 34,000 meters, and 1,500 public
street hydrants. The sewerage portion of the Dacca Project included a new
treatment plant, pumping stat:ions, and about 100 miles of sewers. The
project also included provision for engineering and management consultant
services, staff training programs, equipment and tools, and workshops and
stores facilities. The project to be financed with the proposed credit
would remain fundamentally the same as the 1969 revised project except that
(i) to meet increased water demand resulting from population increase and
industrial growth, and because new areas were added to the jurisdiction of
the Dacca Water and Sewerage Authority, the number of tubewells to be
financed from the project would be increased from 26 to about 46 and the
mileage of water distributiorL pipe would be increased from 114 miles to
about 170 miles; (ii) to cover new areas in the Authority's jurisdiction,
the mileage of sewers to be financed would be increased from 100 miles to
about 150 miles and one addit.ional pumping station would be built; and
(iii) only three 1.0 IMg elevated water tanks would be constructed, with
the proposed fourth tank either deferred or replaced by smaller low level
tanks. The water supply portion of the project is now about 75 percent
completed and the sewerage portion is about 45 percent completed. Due to
the changes indicated above and cost increases since project reappraisal
in 1968, the total cost of the project has increased from US$33.5 million
to US$41.6 million (with abou.t half of the increase resulting from additional
works and half resulting from cost increases). The proposed credit would
finance (i) notional repayment of amounts previously disbursed under Credit
No. 41-PAK (about US$6.0 million), thus debiting Bangladesh with this amount;
(ii) project expenditures incurred prior to December 29, 1971 for which
IDA has not made disbursement (about US$0.7 million); and (iii) about 40
percent of the cost of completing the project. The latter item includes



-3-
the reimbursement to Sweden for such disbursements as may have been made
under an interim credit which is financing foreign expenditures on the project
prior to effectiveness of the proposed new credit (about US$600,000 equivalent).
6.        The principal works included in the Chittagong Project as revised
in 1969 were 8 to 14 tubewells, an iron removal plant, a small surface water
treatment plant and related facilities, a 6.0 IMg reservoir, 72 miles of
water distribution piping, 10,000 to 12,000 new water connections, and 800
to 1,000 public street hydrants. The project also included provision for
engineering and management consulting services, staff training programs,
equipment and tools, and workshops and stores facilities. The project
as now proposed is basically the same as the 1969 revised project, except
that (i) because of industrial growth and population increase, the mileage
of water distribution pipes financed from the project would be increased
from 72 miles to 107 miles; and (ii) due to the water production from ground-
water in greater quantities than could have been safely predicted prior to
the drilling of the wells, the construction of the surface water treatment
plant and related facilities would be deferred (except for site development
and the access road); however, the project would include the preparation
of the final designs for the treatment plant so that it can be constructed
when needed. The project is now about 60 percent completed. Due to the
changes indicated above and to cost increases since project reappraisal in
1968, the cost of the project has increased from US$18.1 million to US$23.8
million. The proposed credit would finance (i) notional repayment of amounts
previously disbursed under Credit No. 42-PAK (about US$3.3 million), thus
debiting Bangladesh with this amount; and (ii) about 40 percent of the cost
of completing the project. The latter item includes the reimbursement to
Sweden for such disbursements as may have been made under an interim credit
which is financing foreign expenditure on the project prior to effectiveness
of the proposed new credit (about US$200,000 equivalent).
7.        In both cases, the proposed credits would finance about 30 percent
of total costs of the projects. Although the impact of recent international
monetary adjustments (the devaluation of the U.S. dollar and the movement of
the Taka from 7.28 to 7.7 per U.S. dollar) is difficult to assess with
precision at the present time, it is estimated that the net impact on
remaining project costs will be very slight. The increase in the dollar
value of the foreign costs of the project likely to result from the dollar
devaluation will be offset by the reduction in the dollar value of local
costs resulting from the change in the Taka/dollar exchange rate. While
the percentage of remaining local currency expenditures financed by the
credits is likely to be reduced slightly, the percentage of total remaining
project costs financed by the credits will be essentially unchanged. If
the impact of these monetary developments should exceed current expectations
and significantly reduce the share in local currency financing provided by
the credits, the Association would be prepared to consider providing further
support for these projects under future lending anticipated to the water and
sewerage sector in Bangladesh.



- 4 -
8.        Disbursement under the proposed credits would be made against the
full foreign exchange costs for supply contracts, the full ex-factory costs
of any supply contracts awarded to local firms after international competi-
tive bidding, the total cost:s of consulting services, the foreign exchange
cost of training programs, and in the case of Dacca about 25 percent of the
costs of remaining civil works contracts for installation of water and
sewerage pipes, and in the case of Chittagong about 15 percent of the costs
of remaining civil works contracts for the installation of water pipes, a
booster pumping station and an elevated storage tank. Construction and
supply contracts which have not previously been awarded are expected to be
signed during 1973 following international competitive bidding. For supply
contracts, local manufacturers will be given a margin of preference equivalent
to 15 percent or the actual import duty, whichever is lower. Construction
of both projects is expectecd to be completed by December 31, 1974.
9.        The Dacca Water and Sewerage Authority and the Chittagong Water
and Sewerage Authority were both established in 1964 as conditions of
effectiveness of our credits. Both Authorities are managed by Boards
including representatives of local interests, but the majority of members
of the Boards are appointed by the Government. The Authorities are not
truly autonomous since budget, capital investment programs, changes in
water or sewerage rates, andl any other matters of policy require approval
of the Government. Progress in the creation of competent public utility
organizations has been slower than anticipated. While there has been
some improvement, major efforts are still required to strengthen management,
operations and finances. While engineering staffs are now adequate in
numbers and technical training, many would benefit from additional practical
training. The accounting staffs still need strengthening, and attempts are
being made to recruit additional qualified accounting personnel. The
proposed projects include funds to finance the foreign exchange costs of
approved staff training programs.
10.       The Authorities have had a long history of financial difficulties
and have not been able to meet the financial performance covenants of the
1963 Project Agreements. The Authorities have always found it difficult
to maintain a satisfactory level of collections, but the situation
worsened considerably during the period of political disturbances. It is
expected that cash collections over the next few years will be sufficient
to meet cash operating expenses, but that the Authorities will have to rely
upon the Government to provide the full local contribution to project
costs, and that the Authorities will not be able to meet their debt service
obligations to the Government. However, due to previous accounting defi-
ciencies and the disruption caused by the civil disturbances, reliable
information about past financial performance is not available and no
recommendations can be made concerning the appropriate steps to improve
the position until there is sufficient information to enable financial
forecasts to be made. It has therefore been agreed that independent
accountants would be employed to review the Authorities' accounts and assist
in preparing financial statements, including a balance sheet, for the year
endirng June 1972 which would be submitted by June 30, 1973.  It has also



been agreed that audited accounts for the year ending June 30, 1973 would
be submitted by December 31, 1973. Based upon this information agreement
would be reached no later than the end of 1974 on water and sewerage rates,
which together with other financial targets will enable the Authorities to
meet within a reasonable time the standards of financial performance included
in the previous agreements. Agreement would also be reached no later than
the end of 1974 on a feasible schedule for debt service payments from the
Authorities to the Government. Meanwhile there would be a moratorium on
debt service on Government loans to the Authorities. The Government has
also agreed to provide all sums required by the Authorities to carry out
the projects, and that, in the unexpected event of a deficit in cash to meet
operating expenditures, the Government would take action to provide the
required additional funds to the Authorities.
11.       Upon completion of the projects continuous on-premise water
service would be available to 70 percent of the population in both Dacca
and Chittagong, with the rest of the population served by public street
hydrants. This represents substantial progress since the projects were
initiated, at which time only about one-third of the population was provided
with any public water services, and the major part of the population had
to rely on inadequate and expensive private facilities which constituted
a serious problem to public health. The lack of adequate water supplies
also was a deterrent to commercial and industrial development. In Dacca
sewerage services would become available to about 60 percent of the popula-
tion, as compared to 10 percent when the project was initiated. While
the establishment of efficient and financially viable water and sewerage
organizations has been slower than anticipated, there has nevertheless
been some progress, brought about in part by the training and technical
assistance provided under the projects. Although close project supervision
will continue to be required to alleviate important organizational and
financial problems, the accomplishments to date in improving the quality
of water and sewerage services can still be considered as a valuable contri-
bution to the development of Bangladesh.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
12.       The draft Development Credit Agreements between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Reports of the Committees
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the texts of resolutions approving the proposed credits are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. Subject to the comments set forth
in paragraph 10 above with reference to financial covenants, the provisions
of the draft Development Credit Agreements conform substantially to the
provisions of the prior Development Credit Agreements with the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and incorporate the relevant provisions of the
Project Agreements with the then Province of East Pakistan. As previously,
there will not be separate Project Agreements with the two Authorities.



- 6 -
13.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credits would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
14.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credits.

C. Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 339, Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; $25.o Million Credit
Tof October lc', 1972; Closing Date June 30, 1976.
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973.   Implemen-
tation of the original project, financed under Credit No. 228-PAK of 1971,
did not commence prior to the suspension of disbursements. The Government
has now set up the central organization for the project, and task forces
for the execution of the sub-projects are being assembled. Sites for cyclone
shelters are being selected, tenders for construction have been invited,
and the Project Coordinator is hopeful of completing sixty shelters
before the onset of the monsoon season. On the primary roads sub-project,
surveyors are in the field determining alignments and making detailed
assessments of work quantities. On the Cyclone Warning sub-project, the
sub-project manager is finalizing specifications of equipment which must
be imported to strengthen the meteorological stations serving the coastal
area. Other sub-projects (inland water transport, telecommunications,
feeder roads, and coastal fiLsheries) are less advanced. A supervision
mission now in the field is reviewing with Government the actions required
to expedite implementation of these sub-projects.
Cr. No. 340;  Chandpur Irrigation II Project; $13.0 Million Credit of
Oct,ober 15, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1977.
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. When
work on the project, previo-usly financed under Credit No. 184-PAK of
1970, was suspended in 1971, the major project civil works were about
half completed. The contractor manufacturing equipment for the regulators
had also made substantial p.rogress. Interim financing by Sweden has allowed
reappointment of project consultants, resumption of construction and rene-
gotiation of the contract for manufacture and installation of the equipment
for the regulators.
Cr. No. 341   Tubewells Pro-ject; $14.0 Million Credit of November 6, 1972;
Clssing Date December 31, 1976.
The project is also being assisted by a $6 million credit
from Sweden and a $6 milliorn grant from Canada. The IDA and Swedish
eredits became effective on January 17, 1973. The project was originally
financed by IDA Credit No. 200-PAK of 1970 and credits from Sweden and
Canada. Bids for -the drilling of project wells had been received in
1971 but no contracts were awarded due to the disturbed conditions.
Interim financing from Sweden has permitted reappointment of project
consultants and retendering. Bids have been received for well drilling
and supply of pumps and engines for the wells, and contracts are expected
to be awarded in the next few weeks. Contracts have been awarded
for required vehicles and miscellaneous equipment.

progress of projects inececution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Cr. No. 343   Telecommunications Project; $7.3 million Credit of
November 15, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1975.
Credit became effective January 17, 1973. The project
was originally financed as part of Credit No. 145-PAK of 1969, and
goods and services valued at about US$2.2 million were received in
Dacca prior to suspension of disbursements. Orders had also been
placed for the remaining equipment now to be financed under Credit
No. 343, and the suppliers are understood to be prepared to resume
work at the original contract prices.
Cr. No. 345   Reconstruction Imports Project; $50.0 million Credit
of November 30, 1972; Closing Date August 31, 1974.
Credit became effective January 30, 1973. The Govern-
ment has prepared a statement allocating the proceeds of the credit
among the various eligible categories of expenditure, taking into
account funds expected to be available from other sources of assistance.
Disbursements are expected to commence shortly.
Cr. No. 353   Small-Scale Industry Project; $3.0 million Credit of
January 19, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976.
Not yet effective. The project was originally financed
by IDA Credit No. 192-PAK of 1970.   By December 1971, when disbursements
were suspended, 28 sub-projects had been approved and $2.19 million had
been allocated to these projects. Work has now begun on reactivation
of the interrupted sub-projects and canvassing for new sub-projects.

TECHNICAL NOTE ON DACCA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Credit 41-PAK for US$26 million was made to Pakistan on August 16,
1963 to help finance a water supply and sewerage project in Dacca.   The
project is being carried out by the Dacca Water and Sewerage Authority
(WASA) which was established for this purpose. The project was substantially
revised in 1969 by eliminating the large surface water treatment plant and
long transmission main and the Credit was reduced to US$13.2 million.
1.02      After the project was revised, construction made good progress
until the political disturbances in March 1971. Despite adverse conditions,
work has continued since then with the exception of the war period in
November and December 1971.
1.03      The war seriously disrupted the construction program, but for-
tunately no significant interruption of water supply occurred. On December
29, 1971, the Association, after consultation with the Government of Pakistan,
suspended disbursements for the project, after the disbursement of US$6.0
million equivalent under the Credit. As a consequence, foreign suppliers
interrupted deliveries of materials. Latterly, the Government of Bangladesh
has supplied the local currency required for the construction program but
from December 29, 1971 until June 1972 no foreign currency was available.
In June 1972, the Kingdom of Sweden agreed to provide an interim credit to
finance urgent expenditure under this project and other interrupted IDA
projects.
1.04      With a view of extending a Credit to Bangladesh to enable it to
complete the project financed under Credit 41-PAK, a mission comprised of
Messrs. P. Jacob, C. Spangler and E. Greenwood visited Bangladesh from
June 28, 1972 to July 19, 1972 to reappraise the project. This report is
based on the mission's findings after discussions with Government, the
Authority and the engineering consultants and also after inspecting the
project and operating facilities in Dacca. An IDA credit of US$13.2 million
equivalent to Bangladesh is proposed to replace the US$13.2 million credit
(41-PAK) to Pakistan.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   Dacca
2.01      The population of Dacca was estimated at about 650,000 in 1969.
It is difficult to estimate the present population. During the war many
people left Dacca but it is assumed they have now returned. In addition
many people have moved into Dacca looking for employment and there are many
now living in temporary "squatter" type shelters. WASA estimates that the



- 2 -
1973 population would be about 1.0 million people. Dacca is now the capital
of the country and its central position in regard to transport and government
will contribute to an accelerated rate of growth.
2.02      At the time of the original project in 1963 water was supplied
from drilled wells through 16 separate systems. In the old city a surface
water treatment plant took water from the Burhi Ganga River. Additions had
been made to the plant from time to time, but most of the equipment had
deteriorated and extensive repair and rehabilitation was required. Water
from the various sources was pumped into about 20 elevated storage tanks about
60 feet high and from there, released to the distribution system, usually a
few hours in the mornings and evenings. About 200 miles of mains from 2"
to 16" in diameter delivered water to the consumers. The sewerage facilities
consisted of about 86 miles of sewers, six intermediate pumping stations and
the main Narinda pumping station discharging to an overloaded treatment plant
located just east of the city. The Dacca Municipal Committee was responsible
for water and sewerage within the Municipality and the Directorate of
Public Health Engineering (DPHE) for the suburbs.
B.   Project History
2.03      The original project (1963) provided for a new large surface water
treatment plant on the Lakhya River, about 21 miles of large transmission
mains, about 157 miles of distribution system piping, a 3.0 IMg elevated
tank, about 23,000 new connections and 37,500 meters. The sewerage component
consisted of about 150 miles of lateral sewers for 10,000 new connections,
about 19 miles of primary sewers from 2 to 4-1/2 feet in diameter, 3 large
intermediate pumping stations, new pumping facilities at a new treatment
plant and an outfall to the Burhi Ganga River below Dacca. A new autonomous
Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) was to take over from the Dacca
Municipal Committee and DPHE all water and sewerage in the metropolitan
area. The project also included engineering and management consultant
services, and some equipment and tools and workshop facilities. This project
which was estimated to cost US$55 million equivalent, was too large and
complex and required too rapid expansion of WASA's operations. The project
was revised in 1969 and reduced in scale by about 32%.
2.04      The revised project deferred the new surface water treatment plant
and provided instead for about 26 new large tubewells, improvements and
modifications of the old surface water plant to double its capacity, about
114 miles of distribution piping, three or four 1.0 lMg high level elevated
tanks and modification of most of the low level tanks, 15,000 to 20,000 new
connections, 21,000 to 34,000 meters and 1,500 new or rebuilt public street
hydrants. The sewerage component was modified by reducing the length of
lateral and main sewers to about 100 miles and constructing seven small
pumping stations instead of three large ones. The main pumping station and
treatment works remained the same except for changing the outfall from the
plant to the river from a pipe to an open channel. The provision for
engineering and management consulting services was increased, a training
program was added to the project, and the provision for equipment, tools,
workshops and stores facilities was expanded.

C.   Present Status of Works
2.05      In spite of the political disturbances in 1971, considerable
progress was made on the overall project, and it is now about 60% completed.
26 new tubewells have been drilled and new 2.0 cusec pumps have been
installed in seven and five of these are now in operation. Ten other new
wells are operating with smaller 1.0 cusec temporary pumps. Other old
wells have been rehabilitated. The equipment for the modification of the
old surface water treatment plant has been delivered and the work on
rehabilitation is starting. The three high level 1.0 IMg elevated storage
tanks are about 95% completed. Almost all of the water distribution pipes
are installed, about 11,000 new connections have been made for a total of
about 28,000 of which about 12,000 are metered. No progress has been made on
improving the public street hydrants in the old city. The sewerage component
of the project has not progressed as well as the water supply. About 40%
of the laterals, main sewers and intermediate pumping stations have been
completed. The main lift station and treatment facilities are about 70%
completed and about 2,400 new connections have been made for a total of about
11,000.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Description of the Project
3.01      From the proceeds of the proposed US$13.2 million credit, US$6.0
million would be used to reimburse IDA for disbursements under Credit 41-PAK,
and about US$0.7 million would be used to meet commitments for services
performed prior to the suspension of the credit, leaving US$6.5 million to
complete the project and to reimburse Sweden for disbursements made under
interim financing arrangements (see para 3.09). The project would remain
basically the same as provided for under Credit 41-PAK as revised in 1969
(Appraisal Report No. TO-363d dated September 27, 1968) and described in
paragraph 2.04 above. However, after detailed review with WASA and its con-
sulting engineers (Messrs. Parsons & Company, a U.S. firm of consulting
engineers) the following modifications have been discussed and agreed with
the Government:
(a)  In order to meet the water needs of new areas not
previously the responsibility of WASA and the increasing
domestic and industrial demand, the number of tubewells to
be financed from the project would be increased from 26
to 46 and the distribution pipe to be financed from the
project would be increased from about 114 miles to about
170 miles;
(b)  Only three elevated water storage tanks of 1 IMg capacity
each should be completed, and the proposed fourth high level
tank in the old city area should be deferred. Instead four
smaller (about 100,000 gallons capacity) low level tanks



may be constructed if the measures taken by WASA to
control wastes through public street hydrants are
effective; and
(c) In order to meet the sewerage needs of new areas not
previously the responsibility of WASA, the length of sewers
to be financed under the project would be increased from
about 100 miles to about 150 miles and the number of
pumping stations would be increased from seven to eight.
A complete project description, taking into account the above modifications,
is given in Appendix I.
3.02      The US$6.5 million available for the completion of the project
would be used to finance the completion of those parts of the old project
as are urgently required and the construction of the additional facilities
described in paragraph 3.01. Continuation of efforts to develop WASA into
an adequate organization for efficient operation would also be part of the
project. Taking into account the proposed modifications in the project,
the works yet to be accomplished are:
A.   Water Supply
1.   The completion of the 26 tubewells and the construction
of 20 additional wells.
2.   The rehabilitation and modification of the old surface
water treatment plant.
3.   The installation of about 55 miles of distribution
system and the continuation of street hydrant, service
connection and metering programs.
4.   The completion of the three 1.0 lMg elevated storage
tanks and the possible construction of four small
low-level tanks.
5.   The purchase of land for the additional tubewells and
elevated tanks.
B.   Sewerage
1.   The completion of sewers under construction, the
rehabilitation of old sewers and construction of
additional sewers.
2.   The completion of the intermediate pumping stations,
the rehabilitation of several old ones and the
construction of an additional one.
3.   The completion of the main sewage pumping station,
the stabilization pond and the discharge channel.



-5-
4.   The continuance of the connection program.
5.   The purchase of land for one additional intermediate
pumping station.
C.   Buildings and Equipment
1.   The completion of stores facilities, workshops,
and provision of equipment and vehicles.
The part of the project already completed and the work still to be carried
out are shown on the attached maps.

/a   Project costs were computed before the recent dollar devaluation and
at a time when the Taka/U.S. aollar exchange rate was 7.28. Since that
time the dollar has been devalued (increasing the dollar value of
foreign costs) and the Taka/dollar exchange rate has risen to 7.7
(decreasing the dollar value of local costs). The net impact of these
developments is difficult to quantify with precision at the present
time, but they are expected to have only a negligible impact on remain-
ing project costs.



-7-
3.05      As regards physical and price contingencies, discussions were held
with local officials engaged in public works and the WASA staff and the
consulting engineers. The cost estimates include provision of physical
contingencies of 20% to take into account unforeseen technical difficulties,
possible changes required in the rehabilitation of the surface water
treatment plant and construction problems encountered during the monsoon
season. The estimate also includes a price contingency at 10% per annum.
Import duties and sales taxes are included in the local currency costs.
3.06      The following table shows the estimated project costs from the
1968 appraisal to the 1972 reappraisal. The estimated cost of the works
to be constructed under the 1968 project are considerably Ligher than was
estimated by the 1970 supervision mission. However, the elimination of
one large elevated water storage tank and the re-routing of a trunk sewer
has resulted in the cost to complete the present works being a little less
than the 1970 cost estimate. The additional elements of distribution pipe,
wells and sewers make up the additional cost of US$4.5 million equivalent
that increases the overall costs.

Total cost reappraised project          41.6
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
3.07      All remaining contracts will be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding. The civil works contracts are expected to be
won by local contractors. The supply contracts still to be awarded are for
well supplies and pumps, distribution system piping, service connection
supplies, additional sewage pumps, pipes and fittings and maintenance equip-
ment and tools. The supply contracts are expected to be won by foreign
suppliers. However, local manufacturers will be given a margin of preference
of 15% or import duties, whichever is lower, as allowed under Credit 41-PAK.
3.08      Disbursements will be against 100% of the C.I.F. costs of imported
goods, 100% against the ex-factory cost of any supply contracts awarded to
local manufacturers on the basis of international competitive bidding, the
foreign exchange costs of training and the total costs of consultants'
service. It is estimated that the above would require about US$5.2 million



-8-
of the US$6.5 million balance available to complete the project. The remain-
ing amount of US$1.3 million is proposed to be disbursed against about 25%
of the cost of civil works contracts for the installation of water mains and
sewers. An estimated schedu:Le of disbursements is at Appendix 2.
3.09      To enable the project to be carried out without delays pending
reactivation of disbursements from the Association, the Government of Sweden
is providing funds through SI]DA for foreign exchange expenditures under an
arrangement with the Government and the Association. The funds provided
under this arrangement should be adequate to meet expenditures incurred
prior to the effectiveness of the proposed new credit.
D.   Engineering and Construction
3.10      The contract for the services of the consulting engineers is being
negotiated at present with Messrs. Parsons & Co,, who have been working on
this project. It is proposed that two expatriate engineers will be assigned
to Dacca to direct the work. The consultant's local staff will be respon-
sible for the design and the supervision of mechanical installations. The
WASA engineering staff will be responsible for the construction of the
distribution system and the operations. This arrangement is satisfactory.
3.11      The remaining supply contracts and the main construction contracts
are likely to be awarded during 1973. Construction of the project is expected
to be completed by December 31, 1974. The closing date for the credit would
be June 30, 1975.
IV. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The water supply portion of the project as revised in 1969 is
about 75% completed. The rehabilitation of the old water treatment plant
and the construction of the three large elevated storage reservoirs is
necessary in order to fully uttilize the works already completed. The
additional wells and distribution system are required to meet the increasing
demand. The project when completed should permit continuous on-premise
water service to about 70% of the population, with the rest being served
by public hydrants.
4.02      The sewerage portion of the project as revised in 1969 is only
about 45% completed. The completion of the collection system, pumping
stations, and treatment facilities is required to be able to fully utilize
the works already under construction. The additional collection system and
intermediate pumping station will permit the collection of sewage from
parts of the city, such as the cantonment area which have recently become
the responsibility of WASA. The project when completed should permit the
sewerage services to be available to about 60% of the population.
4.03      The demand for water and sewerage services will continue to increase
now that Dacca is the capital of an independent country, as well as the



-9 -
main government, commercial and business center.   Unless both parts of
this project are completed, the existing sanitary conditions will deteriorate
with definite adverse implications with regard to the public health of the
city.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
A.   Management and Organization
5.01      The Dacca Authority (WASA) was established under the East Pakistan
Water Supply and Sewerage Ordinance, 1963. WASA was intended to be a
largely autonomous, financially viable public entity, the policy of which
was to be controlled by a Board including representatives from local govern-
ment, the Provincial Government and private interests, while the daily busi-
ness was to be managed by a Chairman, functioning as a general manager. The
former Government, however, exercised control over day-to-day operations to
a much larger degree than was consistent with this concept, resulting in the
Chairman of WASA functioning as an administrator. Frequent changes of senior
personnel contributed to the weakness of the Authority.
5.02      Since the formation of Bangladesh, WASA reports to the Ministry
of Public Works and Urban Development instead of the Ministry of Local
Government. It has not yet been decided whether there would be any modifi-
cations in the Ordinance creating the Authority, and it is too early to say
what influence the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development will
bring to bear on the Authority. However, the Ministry expressed its
approval of the concept of financially viable autonomous authorities for water
and sewerage operations. In view of the extensive shortage of experienced
managerial personnel available in the sector, some thought has been given to
the advantages of a larger Authority encompassing both Dacca and Chittagong
and possibly other cities, but no decision has been taken. The Government
has agreed to consult with the Association before taking any action modifying
WASA's area of jurisdiction.
B.   Operations and Staff
5.03      Generally, the number of staff employed is excessive for the
present level of operations. Because of labor unrest, it has been extremely
difficult to reduce the staff. However, it is expected that the problem
of excess staff can be solved in the future if WASA's operations expand
without proportionate staff increases.
5.04      WASA's engineering staff is adequate in numbers and technical
training. However, too much work, including that of a routine nature, has
been carried out by consultants. Not enough attention has been given by
WASA's engineers to everyday work relating to operations; in particular,
the quality of supervision requires improvement. The progress made should
be reviewed during supervision of the project. WASA's engineers could also
benefit from on-the-job experience working with the consultants.



- 10 -
5.05      The commercial and accounting staff requires strengthening.    The
senior position, that of commercial manager, has been vacant for some
months. The function of chief accountant is carried out by an accounts
officer who returned to Dacca recently, after a long absence. The accounts
officer performs the functJion on an acting'basis only pending the hoped
for return of more senior accounting personnel who had been working in
Pakistan. Efforts are being made to recruit a qualified person as commercial
manager.
5.06      WASA should insti:tute a staff training program including on the
job training as well as some overseas training. An amount of $50,000 has
been included in the credit: to finance the foreign exchange costs of such
training in accordance with a training program acceptable to the Association.
Progress of the training program would be reviewed regularly during super-
vision of the project.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A.   Background
6.01      WASA has been plagued by a long history of serious financial and
accounting problems, including an inability to achieve a satisfactory measure
of financial viability; a lack of timeliness and accuracy in financial
reports; a lack of financial control; poor collection performance and defects
in basic recordkeeping. The last auditor's report, which covered FY 1970,
contained major qualifications including reservations relating to fixed
assets and depreciation, stores, the collectibility of receivables, the
recording of revenues, possible billing omissions and the maintenance of
some of the records. Financial and accounting problems have been due mainly
to a lack of experienced personnel in WASA.
B.   Water Rates and Collections
6.02      The present water and sewerage rate schedule was introduced in
November 1966. Unmetered connections are billed on the basis of the annual
rental value of properties. Metered sales are at a flat rate of TK 2.00
(US$0.27) per 1,000 gallons for domestic sales and a flat rate of TK 4.00
(US$0.55) per 1,000 gallons for commercial and government sales. Industrial
sales are at a reducing scale for higher levels of consumption. Sewerage
charges for properties having water and sewerage connections are equal
to water charges.
6.03      WASA has always found it difficult to maintain a satisfactory
level of collections, and receivables at June 30, 1970 equaled 1.6 times the
revenues for FY 1970. Lack of sufficient Government support for revenue
collection efforts has contributed to the Authority's difficulties.
C.   Short Term Financial Requirements
6.04      Reliable information about past financial performance is not
available and meaningful financial forecasts cannot be made from available



- 11 -
financial information. Financial statements are not, therefore, included
in this report. It is probable that cash generated from operations during
the project implementation period FY 1973 to FY 1975 will be sufficient to
cover cash operating expenses. Cash from operations cannot, however, be
relied upon to provide any contribution towards project costs and Government
has agreed to provide funds needed to complete the project.
6.05      On this basis, the financing plan for the completion of the project
is as follows:
FY1973 to FY1975
Source of          Millions              Millions of
Finance            of Takas              US$ equiv.          Percent
IDA                   47.3                     6.5               38
Government            78.7                    10.8               62
Total           126.0                    17.3              100
6.06      As a prerequisite for setting future financial performance
standards, a thorough review of the Authority's accounts will be carried
out by competent auditors and audited financial statements made available
as soon as possible. Selection of auditors is already under way and Govern-
ment approval is expected shortly. After the auditors are appointed, a
review of WASA's accounts will be made and financial statements for the
year ending June 30, 1972 including a balance sheet as at that date will be
developed to provide a firm basis for preparation of future financial state-
ments. Government has agreed to make available to the Association these
statements by June 30, 1973. For FY1973 and future years, Government has
agreed that audited accounts will be submitted to IDA promptly after the end
of each financial year.
D.   Long Term Objectives
6.07      WASA has never been able to meet the financial performance
covenant in the 1963 Project Agreement. This covenant requires that water
and sewerage rates be set at a level sufficient to cover (a) operating
expenses, including interest and depreciation; (b) principal payments on long-
term indebtedness to the extent they exceed depreciation; and (c) year-
to-year extensions and a reasonable part of the costs of major extensions.
6.08      During the project implementation period FY1973 to FY1975, although
water revenues are not expected to be sufficient to meet the rate covenant
mentioned in paragraph 6.07, as mentioned earlier, there is a fair probabi-
lity that cash collections will be sufficient to meet cash operating
expenses. However, Government has agreed that, if this is not the case,
it will meet the deficiency. Government has also agreed that by no later
than the end of 1974, when reliable financial information about the two
proceding years' operations is expected to be available, in consultation with
the Association, water rates will be reviewed and financial targets set for
WASA which will enable it to meet the financial performance covenant within
a reasonable time.



- 12 -
6.09      WASA's audited balance sheet at June 30, 1970 shows that total
assets of TK 144.3 million are largely financed through government loans
of TK 113.2 million. Until WASA's financial position is strengthened,
and its accounting difficulties overcome so that reliable forecasts can
be made, it would not be realistic for WASA to assume any debt service
obligations. Government has agreed to a moratorium on debt service on
its loans to WASA until the end of FY1975, and that by no later than the
end of 1974, it will decide to what extent its interest in WASA should be
in the form of debt, and it will also agree upon a plan acceptable to the
Association for debt service payments by WASA to Government, which will
include the proposed credit to be made available to WASA.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      It is recommended that the proposed development credit of US$13.2
million equivalent be made to the Government of Bangladesh to permit comple-
tion of the Dacca Water Supply and Sewerage Project.

(a) A financial statement and balance sheet for the year
ending June 1972 will be submitted by June 30, 1973,
and for 1973 and future years audited accounts will be
submitted promptly at the end of each financial year
(para 6.06).
(b) The Government will cause WASA to set rates no later
than the end of 1974, in consultation with the Association,
which together with other financial targets would enable
WASA to meet the financial performance convenant set forth
in paragraph 6.07 within a reasonable time (paragraphs
6.07 and 6.08).
(c) The Government will relend the proceeds of the credit

TECHNICAL NOTE ON CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Credit 42-PAK for US$24.0 million equivalent was made to Pakistan
on August 16, 1963 to help finance a water supply and sewerage project in
Chittagong. The project is being carried out by the Chittagong Water and
Sewerage Authority (WASA) which was established for this purpose. The project
was substantially revised in 1969 mainly by eliminating the sewerage component
and the credit was reduced to US$7.0 million equivalent.
1.02      After the project was revised good progress was being made until the
political disturbances in Mar-h 1971. Despite adverse conditions work has
continued since then, although at a slower pace, with the exception of the
war period in November and December 1971.
1.03      The war seriously disrupted the construction program, but fortunately
no significant interruption of water supply occurred. On December 29, 1971,
the Association, after consultation with the Government of Pakistan suspended
disbursements for the project after the disbursement of US$3.3 million under
the credit. As a consequence, foreign suppliers interupted deliveries of
materials. Throughout the construction program, the Government has supplied
the local currency required, but from December 29, 1971 until June 1972, no
foreign currency was available. In June 1972, the Kingdom of Sweden agreed
to provide an interim credit to finance urgent expenditure under this project
and other interrupted IDA projects.
1.04      With a view of extending a credit to Bangladesh to enable it to
complete the project financed under Credit 42-PAK, a mission comprised of
Messrs. P. Jacob, C. Spangler and E. Greenwood visited Bangladesh from
June 29, 1972 to July 19, 1972 to reappraise the project. This report is
based on the mission's findings after discussions with Government, the
Authority and the engineering consultants, and also after inspecting the
project and operating facilities in Chittagong. An IDA credit of US$7.0 mil-
lion equivalent to Bangladesh is proposed to replace the US$7.0 million
credit (42-PAK) to Pakistan.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   Chittagong
2.01      Chittagong's population was estimated at 360,000   in 1969.  It is
now believed that the population is closer to 550,000 including large numbers
of people who have moved into the city in the last six months with the hope
of finding employment. Chittagong, which is the principal port of Bangladesh,
is a developing industrial center with a steel mill, oil refinery, soap works,
tanneries, a large number of light industrial plants and the railroad and



- 2 -
Port Trust facilities. At present, business activity has been reduced by
disruptions in rail, road and river transportation caused by the war. However,
when normal transportation is restored, Chittagong's industrial and business
activity is bound to experience an accelerated growth.
2.02      The water supply prior to the construction of the present project
comprised a number of old drilled wells of various capacities. Several
wells supplied water to an old iron removal plant located near the center
of the city.  These wells supplied water to five small elevated storage
tanks which furnished water for short periods in the mornings and evenings.
The better homes had roof storage tanks while the poorer homes stored water
in containers or obtained water from nearby small tubewells with hand pumps.
Many individuals had their own wells as did most industries including the
Port Trust and the railway.
B.   Project History
2.03      The original project, which was appraised in 1963, included a
surface water treatment plant with an intake on the Halda river, transmission
mains, distribution system, elevated storage, service connections, meters
and some public sanitary facilities. A sewerage component included lateral
and main sewers, pumping stations, treatment works and outfall. The project
also included engineering and management consultant services and some equipment
and tools and work shop facilities. This project, then estimated to cost
US$47.7 million equivalent, was found to be too ambitious and required too
rapid an expansion of WASA's operations. The project, therefore, was re-
vised and reduced in scale by about 58% in 1969.
2.04      In the revised project, the design and construction of the sewer
system was deferred because of very high costs due to construction problems.
The revised project included a small surface water treatment plant and a small
scheme to collect and divert industrial wastes away from the intake areas.
In addition, ground water was to be developed from a well-field comprising
8 to 14 tubewells. In order to improve the quality of the ground water,
iron removal facilities were included in the revised project. The revised
project also included about 72 miles of water distribution pipes, a 6 lMg
storage reservoir, 800 to 1,000 new or rebuilt public street hydrants, and
about 10,000 to 12,000 new water connections.   The provision for engineering
and management consulting services was increased, a training program was
added to the project, and the provision for equipment, tools, workshops, and
stores facilities was expancied.
C.   Present Status of Work
2.05      Considerable progress has been made on the revised project in spite
of the disturbances during 1971. Ten wells have been drilled of which five
are now in service and the transmission mains and distribution pipes are
in use. The iron removal facility and booster pumping station are under
construction. About 700 street hydrants have been installed but only 50%
of them have been connected to the distribution system. About 2,000 house



-3-
service connections have been made of which 1,870 are metered. All major con-
tracts under the project revised in 1969 have been awarded except for the 6.0
IMg storage reservoir and the surface water treatment plant. Land has been
purchased for the surface water treatment plant and some site development
work is underway.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Description of the Project
3.01      From the proceeds of the proposed US$7.0 million credit, US$3.3
million would be used to reimburse IDA for disbursements under Credit 42-PAK,
leaving US$3.7 million to complete the project and to reimburse Sweden for
disbursements made under interim financing arrangements (see para 3.09).
The project would remain fundamentally the same as provided for under
Credit 42-PAK as revised in 1969 (Appraisal Report No. TO-369d dated
September 27, 1968) and described in paragraph 2.04 above. However, after
detailed review with WASA and its consulting engineers (Messrs. Parsons &
Company, a U.S. firm of consulting engineers) the following modifications
have been discussed and agreed with the Government:
(a) At the time of the 1969 revision the amount of groundwater
which could be produced from the project tubewells could
not be fully determined, and the project included in
addition to the tubewells a surface water treatment plant,
together with an intake from the Halda River, and facilities
to divert industrial wastes to a point downstream from the
intake. It has now been determined that sufficient water
can be obtained from the well-field to meet expected water
demand for the next five years. Moreover, the optimum size
and design of the surface treatment plant and related
facilities should be based upon present analysis rather than
the information available at the time of the 1968 reappraisal.
Therefore the surface water treatment plant and the related
intake and waste diversion facilities will be deferred to the
next stage of the program. Meanwhile the site development
work for the treatment plant and the access road currently
under construction will be completed, and the project will
also include the preparation of detailed design for the
surface treatment plant and related facilities.
(b) In order to meet the increasing water demand, about
35 additional miles of main and distribution pipe will be
installed in rapidly growing residential and industrial
areas, increasing the piping to be financed from the project
to about 107 miles.
A complete project description, taking into account the above modifications,
is given in Appendix I.



- 4 -
3.02      The US$3.7 million available for the completion of the project
would be used to finance the completion of those parts of the old project
and the construction of new facilities as are urgently required. Con-
tinuation of efforts to develop WASA into an adequate organization for
efficient operation would also be part of the project. Taking into account
the modifications in the project described in paragraph 3.01, the works yet
to be accomplished are:
(a)  the completion of the 13 tubewells, the iron removal
facility and the booster pumping station;
(b) the construction of about 35 miles of mains and distribu-
tion pipe, and the continuation of the installation of
street hydrants, service connections and meters;
(c) the construction of the 6.0 IMg Battali Hill reservoir;
(d)  the completion of the construction of workshops and stores
facilities and provision of equipment and vehicles; and
(e) the purchase of land, completion of access road and site
development work and the preparation of the detailed design
for the surface water treatment plant and related facilities.
The part of the project already completed and the work still to be carried
out are shown on the attached map.
3.03      The disbursements from IDA Credit 42-PAK up to December 29, 1971,
by categories are as follows:
Amounts in US$
(a) Tubewells, treatment facilities, pumps
storage tanks, buildings                    328,430

3.05      As regards physical and price contingencies, discussions were
held with local officials engaged in public works and the WASA staff and
the consulting engineers. The cost estimates include provision of physical
contingencies of 20% to take into account unforseen technical difficulties,
possible changes required in the design of the iron removal plant and
construction problems encountered during the monsoon season. The estimate
also includes a price contingency at 10% per annum. Import duties and
sales taxes are included in the local currency costs.
3.06      The following table shows that the estimated project costs are
now about US$1.7 million equivalent higher than was estimated during the
supervision mission in October 1970. Cost increases since 1970 and additions
to the planned distribution system, would normally have caused this figure
to be much higher, but these were largely offset by deferring the water
treatment plant and the associated industrial waste diversion scheme.
1/   Project costs were computed before the recent dollar devaluation and
at a time when the Taka/U.S. dollar exchange rate was 7.28. Since that
time the dollar has been devalued (increasing the dollar value of foreign
costs) and the Taka/dollar exchange rate has risen to 7.7 (decreasing the dollar
value of local costs). The net impact of these developments is difficult
to quantify with precision at the present time, but they are expected to
have only a negligible impact on remaining project costs.

C.   Procurement and Disbursement
3.07      All remaining contracts will be awarded on the basis of internation-
al competitive bidding. The remaining civil works contracts, with the exception
of the contract for the installation of the service reservoir, are expected
to be won by local contractors. The supply contracts still to be awarded
are for the service reservoir, distribution pipes and accessories and
certain workshop and maintenance equipment. These contracts are expected
to be won by foreign suppliers. However, local manufacturers will be given
a margin of preference of 15% or import duties whichever is lower as allowed
under Credit 42-PAK.
3.08      Disbursements will be made against 100% of the C.I.F. costs of
imported goods, 100% against thle ex-factory cost of any supply contracts
awarded to local firms on the basis of international competitive bidding,
the foreign exchange costs of training and the total costs of consultants'
service. It is estimated that the above would require about US$3.3 million
of the US$3.7 million balance available to complete the project. The remain-
ing amount of US$0.4 million is proposed to be disbursed against about 15%
of the cost of construction contracts for the booster pumping station, major
distribution system extensions and the storage reservoir. An estimated
schedule of disbursements is at Appendix 2.
3.09      To enable the project to be carried out without delays, pending
reactivation of disbursements from the Association, the Government of Sweden
is providing funds through SIDA for foreign exchange expenditures under an
arrangement with the Government and the Association. The funds provided
under this arrangement should be adequate to meet expenditures incurred
prior to the effectiveness of the proposed new credit.
D.   Engineering and Construction
3.10      The contract for the services of the consulting engineers is being
negotiated at present with Messrs. Parson & Co., who have been working on
this project. It is proposed that two expatriate engineers would be assigned
to Chittagong to direct the work. The consultants' local staff would be



responsible for the design and the supervision of mechanical installations.
The WASA engineering staff would be responsible for the construction of the
distribution system and the operations. This arrangement is satisfactory.
For the detailed design of the surface water treatment plant, consultants
that are specialists in this field will be employed.
3.11      The remaining supply contracts and the main construction contracts
are likely to be awarded during 1973. Construction of the project is ex-
pected to be completed by December 31, 1974. The closing date for the
credit would be June 30, 1975.
IV. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The water supply project as revised in 1969 is about 60% completed.
Unless the iron removal facility, the service reservoir and distribution
system are also constructed the works completed thus far cannot be fully
utilized. The construction of the Battali hill reservoir is necessary to
ensure continuous water supply to the population. The project when completed
would permit continuous on-premise water service to about 70% of the popu-
lation. The rest of the population will be served by public hydrants.
4.02      Water demand in Chittagong has been increasing rapidly due to an
increase in population. Apart from this it is expected that industrial
demand would increase appreciably as Chittagong's importance as a port
increases. Unless the project is constructed water demand cannot be met
and the existing water supply will further deteriorate with part of the
population having to use water sources that pose a continuing health hazard.
4.03      The future demand of the city will require the utilization of a
surface water source. The present well field would have to be supplemented
in about five years' time. By preparing the detailed designs for the
surface water treatment plant at this time, construction can start during
1975 and the plant should be in production by 1978.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
A.   Management and Organization
5.01      The Chittagong Authority (WASA) was established under the East
Pakistan Water Supply and Sewerage Ordinance, 1963. WASA was intended to
be an autonomous, financially viable public utility, the policy of which
was to be controlled by the Board, including representatives from local
government, the provincial government and private interests, while the
daily business was to be managed by a chairman, functioning as a general
manager. The former Government, however, exercised control over day-to-day



- 8 -
affairs to a much larger degree than was consistent with this concept,
resulting in the chairman of WASA functioning merely as an administrator.
Frequent changes of senior personnel contributed to the weakness of WASA.
5.02      Since the formation of Bangladesh, WASA reports to the Ministry
of Public Works and Urban Development instead of the Ministry of Local
Government. It has not yet been decided whether there would be any modifi-
cation in the Ordinance creating the Authority, and it is too early to
say what influence the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development will
bring to bear on the Authority. However, the Ministry expressed its
approval of the concept of financially viable autonomous authorities for
water and sewerage operations.   In view of the extreme shortage of
experienced managerial personnel available in the sector, some thought
has also been given to the advantages of a larger Authority encompassing both
Chittagong and Dacca and possibly other cities, but no decision has been
taken. The Government has agreed to consult with the Association before
taking any action modifying WASA's area of jurisdiction.
B.   Operations and Staff
5.03      Generally, the number of staff employed I.s excessive for the
present level of operations. Because of labor unrest, it has been extremely
difficult to reduce the staff.   However, it is expected that the problem
of excess staff can be solved in the future if WASA's operations expand
without proportionate staff increases.
5.04      WASA's engineering staff is adequate in both numbers and technical
training. However, its performance and especially the quality of supervision
requires improvement. This is indicated by high water losses, often poor
quality water and the dependence on consultants for much of the work relating
to connections and routine extensions. Most of the public street hydrants
now have faucets but about half of these are not yet in operation. These
should all be put in service and an intensive effort should be made to
educate the consumers not to waste water. Surveys need to be made of house
fixtures and roof tanks to repair leaks and stop wastage. As more elements
of the project are completed and become operative, WASA should be able to
divert its staff from construction supervision to operations management.
This should lead to improvement in operations in the future. The progress
made would be reviewed during supervision of the project.
5.05      Unlike the engineering staff, the accounting staff needs to be
strengthened by qualified and experienced people. The commercial manager
has adequate training and experience to fill the position effectively. He
is handicapped, however, by inadequate supporting staff. Attempts are
being made to recruit a senior accounts officer to strengthen the staff.
5.06      WASA should institute a staff training program including on the
job training as well as some overseas training. An amount of $50,000 has
been included in the credit to finance the foreign exchange costs of such



- 9 -
training in accordance with a training program acceptable to the Association.
Progress of the training program would be reviewed regularly during super-
vision of the project.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A.   BackRround
6.01      WASA has been plagued by a long history of serious financial and
accounting problems including an inability to achieve a satisfactory
measure of financial viability; lack of timeliness and accuracy in financial
reports; lack of financial control; inadequate auditing services; poor col-
lection performance and defects in basic record-keeping. The last audit
covered FY 1970 and, although the auditors' report revealed the need for
many accounting adjustments, strong doubts exist as to the quality of the
audit work. Financial and accounting problems have been due mainly to
the lack of experienced personnel in WASA referred to earlier (paragraph
5.04).
B.   Water Rates and Collection
6.02      The present water rate schedule was introduced in November 1966.
Unmetered connections are billed on the basis of the annual value of
properties. Metered sales are at a flat rate of TK 2.00 (US$0.27) per 1,000
gallons for domestic sales and a flat rate of TK 4.00 (US$0.55) per 1,000
gallons for commercial and government sales. Industrial sales are at a
reducing scale for higher levels of consumption. Revenues from the present
water rates are expected to be adequate to cover cash operating expenses
but will not also cover debt service.
6.03      WASA has always found it difficult to maintain a satisfactory
level of collections, and receivables at June 30, 1971 exceeded revenues
for FY 1971. The extent to which domestic billings, especially for the
last year, can be collected is difficult to predict. Accounts are paid
at local banks, but detailed collection reports have not been submitted
to WASA for some time because of staffing difficulties experienced by
t'hLese banks.
C.   Short-Term Financial Requirements
6.04      Reliable information about past financial performance is not
available and meaningful financial forecasts cannot be made from available
information. Financial statements are not, therefore, included in this
report. It is probable that WASA's water revenue collections during the
project implementation period FY 1973 to FY 1975 will be sufficient to meet
cash operating expenses. Cash collections cannot, however, be relied upon
to provide any contribution towards project costs and Government has agreed
to provide the funds needed to complete the project.
6.05      On this basis, the financing plan for the completion of the
project is estimated as follows:



- 10 -
FY 1973 to FY 1975
Source of        Millions of       Millions of
Finance            Takas           US$ equivalent       Percent
IDA                26.93                3.7              42.0
Government         39.44                5.4              58.0
Total         66.37                9.1             100.0
6.06      As a prerequisite for setting future financial performance
standards, a thorough review of WASA's accounts will be carried out by
competent auditors and audited financial statements made available as soon
as possible.  Selection of auditors is already under way and Government
approval is expected shortly. After the auditors are appointed, a review
of WASA's accounts will be made and financial statements for the year
ending June 30, 1972 including a balance sheet as at that date will be
developed to provide a firm basis for preparation of future financial
statements. Government has agreed to make available to the Association
these statements by June 30, 1973. For FY 1973 and future years, Government
has agreed that audited accounts will be submitted to IDA promptly after
the end of each financial year.
D.   Long-Term Objectives
6.07      WASA has never been able to meet the financial performance
covenant in the 1963 Project: Agreement. This covenant requires that water
and sewerage rates be set at: a level sufficient to cover (a) operating
expenses, including interest: and depreciation; (b) principal payments on
long-term indebtedness to the extent they exceed depreciation; and
(c) year-to-year extensions and a reasonable part of the cost of major
extensions.
6.08      During the project: implementation period FY 1973 to FY 1975,
although water revenues are not expected to be sufficien!t to meet the rate
covenant mentioned in paragraph 6.07, cash collections are expected to be
sufficient to meet cash operating expenses. However, Government has
agreed that, if this is not the case, it will meet the deficiency. Govern-
ment has also agreed that by no later than the end of 1974, when reliable
financial information over the preceding two years is expected to be
available, in consultation with the Association, water rates will be reviewed
and financial targets set for WASA which will enable it to meet the
financial performance covenant within a reasonable time.
6.09      At June 30, 1971, WASA's total assets are estimated at TK75
million. These assets are 'Largely financed by Government loans amounting
to about TK 70 million, including the IDA Credit 42-PAK relent to WASA.
Until the accounting problems of WASA are resolved and its financial
position improves, it will not be possible for WASA to assume any debt



- 11 -
service obligation. Government has agreed to a moratorium on debt
service on its loans to WASA until June 30, 1975, and that by no later than
the end of 1974, it will decide to what extent its interest in WASA should
be in the form of debt, and it will also agree upon a plan acceptable to
the Association for debt service payments by WASA to Government, which will
include the proposed credit to be made available to WASA.
VII. RECO1MENDATIONS
7.01      It is recommended that the proposed development credit of US$7.0
million equivalent be made to the Government of Bangladesh to permit comple-
tion of the Clittagong Water Supply Project.
7.02      The following conditions under Credit 42-PAK which are still
applicable without modification hiave been agreed to by the Government:
(a) The Government will provide W4ASA with all sums required
for carrying out the project (paragraph 6.04).
(b) The Government will cause W9ASA to employ contractors and
consultants acceptable to the Association on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association.
(c) The Government will cause WASA not to incur any long-term
debt, unless net revenues during a preceeding 12-month period
exceeded 1.25 times the maximum debt service requirement.
(d) The Government will cause WASA not to incur short-term debt
except in the ordinary course of business for working capital
purposes.
(e)  The Government will cause WASA not to undertake functions
other than water supply and sewerage without prior consulta-
tion with the Association.
(f) The Government will inform the Association of any proposal
to change the Chairman of WASA and give the Association a
reasonable opportunity to express its views on the proposed
candidate for this position.
(g)  Upon project completion, the Government will use its best
efforts to cause the Chittagong Port Trust and the facilities
in Chittagoing of the Bangladesh Railways to obtain their
potable water supply from WASA.
7.03      The following conditions under Credit 42-PAK which are still
applicable with necessary modifications have been agreed to by the
Government:



- 12 -
(a) A financial statement and balance sheet for the year ending
June 1972 will be s;ubmitted by June 30, 1973, and for 1973
and future years audited accounts will be submitted promptly
at the end of each financial year (paragraph 6.06).
(b) The Government will cause WASA to set rates no later than
the end of 1974, in consultation with the Association, which
together with other financial targets would enable WASA to
meet the financial oerformance covenant set forth in para-
graph 6.07 within a reasonable time (paragraphs 6.07 and 6.08).
(c) The Government will relend the proceeds of the credit to
WASA on terms and conditions to be agreed between the Govern-
ment and the Association no later than the end of 1974 (para-
graph 6.09).
7.04      In addition, the fo:Llowing assurances have been obtained from
the Government:
(a) It will consult with the Association before taking any action
modifying WASA's area of jurisdictiou (paragraph 5.02).
(b) It will meet any cash deficiencies in WASA operations
(paragraph 6.08).
(c)  It will agree to a moratorium on debt service on its loans
to WASA until June 30, 1975, and by the end of 1974 agree
to a feasible schedule for debt service payments from WASA
to the Government (paragraph 6.09).
