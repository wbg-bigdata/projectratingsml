                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has reached a disbursement rate of 70% of loan proceeds and approximately all loan resources are committed under existing works and consultant contracts. The loan is
                         currently scheduled to close on November 30, 2012. Given that some key works contracts with associated social development and resettlement activities are expected to still be
                         under implementation by then, the Borrower and the Bank discussed an extension of closing date of 11 months until October 31, 2013 to enable the conclusion of key activities. The
                         Borrower is preparing the necessary documentation for Federal Government approval.
