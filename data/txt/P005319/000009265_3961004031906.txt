MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the equivalent of US$20.0 million
to finance a Health Management Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of twenty years, including a five year grace period.
2.         Macroeconomic and Sector Backoround. Jordan has a small population, a
limited resource base and an economy that is highly dependent on the prosperity of the oil-rich
countries of the region, notably through remittances from Jordanians working in oil-producing
countries, grants from these countries' goverments, and intra-regional exports. The slow-
down in economic activity in the region in the mid-1 980s led to a decline in Jordar's GDP and
per capita income along with large budgetary and balance of payment deficits during the latter
years of the decade. In 1989, the Government responded by implementing a structural
adjustment program supported by the Bank and the IMF. The program was being successfully
implemented when the Gulf crisis intervened, severely exacerbating Jordan's economic
difficultles through a combination of lost grants, remittances, export and transit trade
eamings, and an influx of about 300,000 returnees from neighboring countries. Following the
crisis, the Govemment has resumed the adjustment process with the support of the
intemational community. During 1992, economic performance substantially exceeded
exppctations. Reflecting a boom in housing construction (based on inflows of returnee
savings) and a strong recovery in agriculture and manufacturing, GDP is estimated to have
grown by over 11 % and the budgetary deficit fell sharply. Over the medium term, the
Govemment plans to maintain its stabilization and adjustment efforts as a basis for
restructuring the economy in order to secure sustainable long-run growth. Inter alia these
efforts include reduction of the budgetary deficit from a projected 8% of GDP in 1993 to 5%
by 1998. Achieving this target will depend critically on containing the budgetary burden of
publicly provided services, including services (such as health and education) designed to
maintain and enhance Jordan's strong human resource base. This in turn implies substantial
improvements in the efficiency of service providers such as the Ministry of Health (MOH),
which is the main institutional source of primary and hospital care in Jordan, especially for
poor and vulnerable groups.
3.         Jordan spends a large proportion of its GOP and government budget on health
care (over 8% in both cases). As a result, health conditions have improved substantially over
the years and health indicators compare favorably with those for other countries in the region.
Life expectancy at birth has risen from 49 to 67 years since 1965, and infant mortality has
fallen from 1 14 to 51 per 1,000 live births. Further improvements are now potentially at risk,
however, owing to the combination of constraints on increased expenditures and population
pressures. Although the population growth rate has fallen substantially in recent years,
reflecting a nearly 30% decline in fertility rates and a nearly 50% increase in contraception



-3 -
practices since 1977, the natural rate of increase remains a high 3.2%.
4.          Continued improvements in the health status of the population are also put at
risk by qualitative shortfalls in MOH services. In the primary care sector, while access is good
(with about one primary health care (PHC) center per 6,000 population), the quality of
services is low, largely owing to inadequately trained professional and support staff, and unit
costs are high, reflecting underutilization (patients prefer treatment at hospital out-patient
departments, whose staff are perceived to be superior). Primary care centers are especially
weak in the area of family planning (they account for 12% of contraceptive distribution while
they cater to over 45% of women), again reflecting poorly trained staff. The MOH hospital
network suffers from inadequate facilities and maintenance, and weakness in key services
such as emergencies. MOH tees contribute little to cost recovery, are inequitable as between
different client groups, encourage patients to bypass primary care facilities, and are poorly
collected. Finalhy, MOH is inefficiently organized and lacks the management systems and
expertise tc operate its services effectively, while its capacity to develop medium term
strategies is hampered by inadequate information systems and planning capacity.
5.          Project obiectives. The project is designed to enhance the health status of the
population through (a) qualitative improvements in MOH primary and hospital services, and
(b) reform of MOH organization, management, finances and planning capacity.
6.          Proiect descriotion. The project has the following five components: (a) service
upgrading (US$5.4 million base cost), for training PHC doctors, nurses and midwives with
special emphasis on Maternal and Child Health (MCH)/family planning, educating the
population about the appropriateness of using PHCs as first points of contact for health
issues, strengthening hospital management systems and training managerial staff, and
establishing a decentralized hospital management system at a pilot site; (b) facilities
improvement (US$15.7 million base cost), for selectively renovating and equipping MOH
facilities at one hospital, master-planning a second and upgrading emergency services at five
others, and improving MOH maintenance and storage services and facilities; (c) Organization
and management (US$2.2 million base cost), for reorganization of the central and regional
administration of MOH, decentralization of management of day-to-day service delivery, a study
of MOH staffing, training of managerial and administrative staff, and developing management
information systems at central, regional and facility levels; (d) financing and cost recovery
(US$1.2 million base cost), for a study of early cost recovery measures (with safeguards for
the poor), helping MOH to develop a more rational fee structure over the medium term, and
improving operations of the MOH health insurance fund (in the immediate short term, the
Government has agreed to a series of preliminary fee adjustments that will raise MOH cost
recovery by 10% and establish a gradient between primary care and hospital outpatient
charges to increase utilization of PHCs as first point of contact); (e) long-term planning
(US$0.8 million base cost), for studies of the health status and epidemiological trends in the
population, and of the feasibility of a national health insurance scheme.
7.          Project Cost and Financina. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$30.0 million equivalent. The World Bank loan will finance US$20.0 million. The
Government of Jordan will finance US$7.6 million, and the remaining US$2.4 million will be
supplied by co-financiers, for foreign technical assistance. Retroactive financing of up to
US$0.5 million will be included for costs incurred prior to loan signing but after September 30,



-4-
1992, on equipment and specialist services necessary for timely project start-up. Schedule
A provides a project cost breakdown and financing plan. Schedule B shows amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement. A timetable of key project processing events
appears in schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Jordan is given in schedule
D.
8.         Project imDlementation. The project will be implemented by the Ministry of
Health. A Project Implementation Unit will coordinate all project activities and report directly
to the Secretary General of the MOH.
9.         Proiect sustainabilitv. The project aims at improving productivity in the MOH.
Primary care upgrading will not generate additional recurrent costs. Hospital rehabilitation
works will not create additional hospital beds, and costs resulting from operating new
maintenance centers will be more than compensated by fewer breakdowns and less
equipment outage. Cost recovery measures will increase non-budgetary financing for MOH
recurrent costs, and shift demand from costlier hospital care to less expensive PHC services,
thus saving recurrent costs.
10.        Lessons from Drevious Droiects. Previous Bank lending experience in the sector
mainly comprises a FY86 Primary Health Care project, now near completion, which has
expanded access to preventive and primary care services. Though reasonably successful, this
project has not significantly improved primary care delivery, mostly because its training
component was not strong enough and the implementation unit in charge of its coordination
was not integrated in MOH's activities. Both lessons have been incorporated in the present
project.
11.        Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank's assistance strategy includes
supporting Jordan's efforts to maintain and develop social services, especially for poor and
vulnerable population groups. MOH is the main provider of health care for such groups.
Upgrading care while containing costs will involve major efficiency enhancement in service
provision. The Government has already initiated a reform process to introduce such
enhancements.
12.        Aareed actions. Prior to negotiations, the Jordan Cabinet approved a by-law
giving force to the reorganization of the MOH. During negotiations, assurances were received
about the timing of MOH reorganization, timely completion of studies of MOH staffing and
cost recovery measures, implementation of the two long term studies financed under the
project, and commitment by the Government either to secure project cofinancing or secure
other resources in a timely fashion to cover any project cofinancing not pledged by
cofinanciers as of August 31, 1993. A condition of effectiveness will be that the Project
Implementation Unit be established with terms of reference, organization and staffing
acceptable to the Bank.
13.        Environmental aspects. The project has been placed in environmental Category
C: "no appreciable environmental impact". Provision has been made in the project design for
the proper disposal of sanitary, medical and laboratory waste, and for the most economical
use of water resources.



-5-
14.        Proiect Obiective Categories. The project will improve health conditions in
Jordan through MOH service upgrading, while containing budgetary costs. It will easo
strengthen MOH's sector management and planning capacity.
15.        Prolect Benefits. Training PHC doctors and nurses and midwives will raise the
quality of primary care in general, and of mother and child health/family planning services in
particular, helping to further reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, and to
increase rates of contraception use. Upgrading maternity and surgical services in the largest
hospital in the Northem Region will eliminate present unsanitary conditions, and help reduce
rates of infection, morbidity and mortality. Training emergency service staff and improving
their equipment will improve the treatment and reduce the adverse after-effects of
emergencies. Improved maintenance services will reduce equipment breakdowns and yiek,
net savings in costs. Enhanced MOH management (including devolution of decision-making
to the regional and facility levels) will improve the quality and responsiveness to client needs
of day-to-day grassroots service delivery. The sector financing component will help lay the
basis for containing public expenditure while improving equity. The project will also help MOH
develop an efficient administrative structure and prepare a long term strategy for the sector.
Finally, the project will enhance the welfare of thie poor, who are disproportionately high users
of MOH services.
16.        Risks. The main risk relates to the ability of MOH to carry out its administrative
reform and decentralization program in an effective and timeiy manner. In addition, improved
management and grassroots service delivery will depend critically on upgrading the human
resources irvolved; and it may prove difficult to realize necessary improvements in cost
recovery during a period of austerity. These risks will be mitigated by (i) the careful design
of the content and timetable for MOH reorganization, Cabinet approval of the reorganization
program, and advance sensitization of staff to it; (ii) the project's substantial program of
managament and staff training at all levels and (iii) the inclusion of safeguards for the poor in
the project study of cost recovery options.
17.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive. Directors approve it.
