Jordan University Hospital (JUH).
Hospital utilization figures may be lower than the actual figures due to a reputed under reporting of private hospitals.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
HEALTH  NAuGEMET PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Proiect Suuary
Borrower:             Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Beneficiarv:          Ministry of Health (MOH)
Amount:               US$ 20 million
Terms:                Repayment in 20 years, including 5 years grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate.
Objectives &          Objectives. The project is designed to enhance the health status of the
Description:          population through (a) qualitative improvements in MOH primary and hospital
services, and (b) reform of MOH organization, management, finances and
planning capacity.
Description. The project has the following five components: (a) service
upgrading (US$5.4 million base cost), for training of Primary Health Care
Center (PHC) doctors, nurses and midwives with special emphasis on Maternal
and Child Health (MCH)/family planning, educating the population about the
appropriateness of using PHCs as first points of contact for health issues,
strengthening hospital management systems and training managerial staff, and
establishing a decentralized hospital management system at a pilot site; (b)
facilities improvement (US$15.7 million base cost), for selectively renovating
and equipping MOH facilities at one hospital, master-planning a second and
upgrading emergency services at five others, and improving MOH maintenance
and storage services and facilities; (c) Organization and management (US$2.2
million base cost), for reorganization of the central and regional administration
of MOH, decentralization of management of day-to-day service delivery, a study
of MOH staffing, training of managerial and administrative staff, and developing
management information systems at central, regional and facility levels; (d)
financing and cost recovery (US$1.2 million base cost), for a study of early
cost recovery measures (with safeguards for the poor) helping MOH to develop
a more rational fee structure over the medium term, and improving operations
of the MOH health insurance fund (in the immediate short term, the
Government has agreed to a series of preliminary fee adjustments that will raise
MOH cost recovery by 10% and establish a gradient between primary care and
hospital outpatient charges to increase utilization of PHCs as first point of
contact); (e) long-term planning (US$0.8 million base cost), for studies of the
health status and epidemiological trends in the population, and of the feasibility
of a national health insurance scheme.



Benefits:               Training PHC doctors and nurses and midwives will raise the
quality of primary care in general, and of mother and child health/family
planning services in particular, helping to further reduce maternal and infant
mortality and morbidity, and to increase rates of contraception use. Upgrading
maternity and surgical services in the largest hospital in the Northern Region
will eliminate present unsanitary conditions, and help reduce rates of infection,
morbidity and mortality. Training emergency service staff and improving their
equipment will improve the treatment and reduce the adverse after-effects of
emergencies. Improved maintenance services will reduce equipment
breakdowns and yield net savings in costs. Enhanced MOH management
(including devolution of decision-making to the regional and facility levels) will
improve the quality and responsiveness to client needs of day-to-day grassroots
service delivery. The sector financing component will help lay the basis for
containing public expenditure while improving equity. The project will also
help MOH develop an efficient administrative structure and prepare a long term
strategy for the sector. Finally, the project will enhance the welfare of the
poor, who are disproportionately high users of MOH services.
Risks:                  The main risk relates to the ability of MOH to carry out its administrative
reforn and decentralization program in an effective and timely manner. In
addition, improved management and grassroots service delivery will depend
critically on upgrading the human resources involved; and it may prove difficult
to realize necessary improvements in cost recovery during a period of austerity.
These risks would be mitigated by (i) the careful design of the content and
timetable for MOH reorganization, Cabinet approval of the reorganization
program, and advance sensitization of staff to it; (ii) the project's substantial
program of management and staff training at all levels and (iii) the inclusion of
safeguards for the poor in the project study of cost recovery options.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROJECT
I. MACROECONOMIC AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Macroecononiic Setting
1.01        During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Jordan achieved high rates of GDP growth,
averaging 8% in real terms between 1978 and 1983. Growth slowed during the middle and the late
1980s as the price of oil fell and the economies of neighboring countries, towards which much of
Jordan's productive activities are targeted, stagnated. As a result, the balance of payments
deteriorated and the budget deficit rose to 21 % of GDP in 1989. Devaluation of the Jordanian Dinar
resulted in a sharp rise in prices, against a background of growing unemployment.
1.02        In 1989, the Government adopted an adjustment program supported by an IMF
standby and a US$ 150 million World Bank Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan. The
program emphasized correction of macroeconomic imbalances and policies and institutional reforms to
stimulate growth. The adjustment was being successfully implemented when the Gulf crisis erupted.
The crisis had a severe effect on the Jordanian economy in terms of lost grants, exports, remittances,
and transit trade earnings. In addition, about 300,000 Jordanians who used to live and work in the
Gulf returned to Jordan. While some of the direct incremental budgetary burden of the additional
services (housing, transportation, health, education, etc.) needed for these "returnees" was offset by a
FY92 World Bank Emergency Recovery Loan and bilateral assistance, the crisis exacerbated Jordan's
already difficult medium-term prospects.
1.03        Following the Gulf crisis, the Jordanian Government has resumed its strategy for
restoring macroeconomic balances and structural reform through changes in incentives and
strengthening of institutions to increase and diversify exports, more effective operation of Jordan's
infrastructure, and a more efficient investment program. The strategy also includes a substantial
deficit reduction effort, that will require inter alia, more efficient and cost-effective delivery of
publicly provided services (including those in the social sectors). At the same time, the Government
is committed to maintaining a low-cost social services network (social safety net) for the poor.
1.04        Although economic performance in 1992 has substantially exceeded expectations, with
an estimated increase in GDP of over 11 % and a substantial reduction in the deficit, further reduction
in budgetary pressures will be needed in the coming years. Meanwhile, total health sector
expenditures, public and private, are estimated at 8.5% of GDP, a very high figure for a middle
income country.



-2 -
Public sector expenditure on health amounted to about JD90 million in 1991, or 8.4% of Government
expenditures, and about 3.7% of GDP. As part of the ongoing adjustment process, costs will have to
be contained against a background of rising demand and needed service improvements: hence the need
to manage public sector health interventions more effectively and to improve cost recovery and sector
financing measures.
B. Health Conditions and Population Policy
1.05        Health Status. The health of the Jordanian population has improved significantly
during the past quarter century: life expectancy at birth increased from 49 years in 1965 to 67 years
in 1990, and infant mortality fell from 114 to 51 per 1,000 live births. This compares favorably with
other countries of the Middle East, and with countries with similar per capita GDP (weighted
averages of 64 and 55, respectively). Maternal mortality (40 per 100,000) is also low for a country
with Jordan's high total fertility rate (para 1.08). Despite Jordan's recent economic difficulties,
expanding health care provision has helped maintain the health status of the population.
1.06        Health Risk Changes. Chronic and degenerative diseases and injuries among adults
are rising (as documented by hospital mortality data and visits to primary care facilities), reflecting
health risk changes linked to the ageing of the population, industrialization and urbanization. The
incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancers and injuries is also rising, and is a growing concern for
the health system as the proportion of the population aged over 65 is expected to increase from
today's 2.4% to over 6.8% in 2025. Still, communicable diseases continue to take a high toll in
morbidity and mortality, especially in rural areas and in infants and children under the age of five.
The three main reasons for PHC visits are diseases of the respiratory system (33%), infectious and
parasitic diseases (14%) and diseases of the digestive system (10%).
1.07        Nutrition. Malnutrition was not an issue in Jordan before the Gulf crisis, but with a
combination of falling incomes and rising prices making it difficult for vulnerable families to meet
their basic needs, nutrition has become a problem in some areas of the country. A national survey
undertaken by the MOH at the end of 1991 showed that, although the diet of average Jordanian
children meets or exceeds the recommended daily allowances (RDA) for most nutrients, 16% of
children were chronically malnourished (stunted), and 1.6% were acutely malnourished (wasted). In
many cases, malnutrition reflects problems (such as early discontinuation of breast feeding, chronic
diarrhea, or intestinal worms), that can be resolved through improved primary care and grassroots
information and education programs.
1.08        Population and Family Planning. Jordan has historically had a very high population
growth rate, averaging about 3.9% per annum between 1970 and the early 1980s, gradually falling to
a currently estimated 3.2%. Figure 1.01, which gives comparative data on growth rates for Jordan
and other countries in the region, shows that Jordan compares favorably with neighboring countries
but less well with the countries of the Maghreb and Egypt. The total fertility rate has fallen
substantially in recent years, from 7.7 in 1976 to 6.6 in 1983 to 5.7 in 1990. Rates for comparable
countries include 6.1 in Algeria, 5.5 in Iran, and a substantially lower 4.1 in Tunisia and Egypt.

1.10          Until recently, there was no official Government policy on contraception and family
planning, but the situation is changing. In view of the present economic and demographic situation,
the Government has made the reduction of population growth an explicit policy goal, and an MOH
policy statement issued in February 1992 identifies promotion of efficient family planning activities as
one of its priorities. The lead role in family planning is played by the private sector, however;



-4-
private doctors, clinics and hospitals accounted for 60% of all modem contraceptive usage. Within
the public sector, family planning is one of the responsibilities of MOH's Directorate for Primary
Care, but its role has hitherto been limited (accounting for about 12% of IUD insertions and 9% of
pill prescriptions), despite the fact that these items are readily available at MOH's extensive network
of primary health care centers (para 2.03). The limited role of the public sector appears to reflect
poor staff training and outreach rather than shortages of facilities or equipment, coupled with some
resistance to family planning among MOH's relatively less well off and less well educated clientele,
especially in rural areas. The Government also supports the family planning activities of NGOs,
some of which have strong links with the Crown, such as the Queen Alia Fund and the Noor Al-
Hussein Foundation. Family planning activities are also supported by UNFPA and USAID, among
other donor agencies (para 2.27). Further informad.ion on population and family planning is given in
Annex I.
II. ISSUES IN HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY AND MANAGEMENT
A. Health Service Provision and Institutional Framework
1. The Private Sector
2.01          Jordan's private
health care sector accounts for a                        Health Expenditure
high and rising proportion of                                 (  of GDP)

2.01), and employs an important
proportion of Jordan's health                  a ................................................................

private sector attracts both                                      . ..   --................ ..
general practitioners (GPs) and
specialists, and the fees they  
charge range from JD1 or JD2

Although these fees are about ten
times those in the public sector,
demand for what is perceived to                                  rt  flOl
be superior private sector care is
high: thus, the private sector accounts for nearly 40% of all first contacts in the primary care system
and over 50% of specialized ambulatory care. The private sector also accounts for a substantial
proportion of hospital beds (over 25%) and this percentage is expected to rise with increased
investment in private hospital facilities by medical professionals who have returned to Jordan in the
wake of the Gulf War.

(1991)

substantial role played by the private
* .      _....                   .                          sector, MOH remains the main

_  Tot.L. n.bern       Fi-t* ..tor                   hospitals", MOH disposes of
substantial financial and human
resources. Estimates for 1992 put
the MOH budget (i.e. the direct
MOH burden on the national budget, not including resources drawn from health "insurance" finds,
see para 2.21) at just over JD 76 million; abcut 70% of the budget (JD 53 million) was for recurrent
costs, and about 60% of recurrent costs were for the wages and salaries of MOH's staff of over
16,000 (para 2.16).
B. Health Care Coverage and Utilization
1. Primary care
2.03           MOH operates an extensive primary health care network, consisting of 214 Village
Health Clinics (VHCs) 274 Primary Health Care centers (PHCs, about 40% of which also include
dental clinics), 161 Maternal and Child Health Care centers (MCHs, most of which are now
integrated with PHCs), and 18 Comprehensive Care Centers (CHCs, which offer normal primary care
services plus some in-patient capacity and specialist services on an intermittent basis). With about
one center per 6,000 population, and with an average patient travel time to the nearest clinic of 30
minutes, this represents a high density system by international standards. In addition to the MOH
network, UNRWA operates 21 primary care centers and 30 special care clinics for Jordan's nearly
one million Palestinian refugees. Finally, as already noted, the private sector is already active in
primary care, accounting for nearly 40% of all initial patient contacts; private practice is mainly
confined to urban areas, however, and caters to better-off Jordanians who can afford much higher
private sector fees.
Hospital care is also provided by a separate network of hospitals for the military and their dependents operated by the
Royal Medical Services (RMS), and by Jordan University Hospital (JUH). An experimental merger of hospital
services provided by MOH, RMS and JUH initiated in 1988 was abandoned in the face of institutional and
professional resistance in 1990, and management was restored to the previous providers.



-6 -
2.04          A large proportion of public sector patients seek primary care at MOH hospitals
rather than at PHCs. Outpatient departments (OPDs) are overcrowded with self-referred clients,
leading to a high outpatient visit ratio of 300 per 1,000 population per year. The ratio rises to 500
per 1,000 if emergency room visits are included; a recent (end 1991) survey of Irbid hospital
emergency cases showed that less than 25 % of all "emergency" cases required the advice of a
specialist, and only a minority of those led to the admission of the patient, suggesting that many
patients used emergency room visits essentially to obtain primary care. Patient preferences for
hospitals over PHCs reflects both a widely held belief that hospitals are "better" than primary care
facilities, and a concern about the quality of PHC staff (which is often lower than that of hospital
personnel: para 2.15). Reflecting continuing patient preference for hospital-based primary care, even
allowing for the inconvenience and delays involved in traveling to and waiting at heavily overcrowded
outpatient departments, many primary care facilities of all kinds are under-utilized. As a result, about
60% of PHC doctors see under 15 patients a day. With under 5 million contacts, the MOH primary
care system has a very low level of annual usage per unit of population (less than 1.5, where an
average of 3 would be expected).
2.05          PHCs are also responsible for public health activities not directly related to patient
care and health data collection/information systems at the local level. Public health activities (pest
control, water safety, sanitation, food quality control, etc.) are usually performed by technicians at the
PHC level, under the supervision of the doctor in charge. These activities tend to be both over-
staffed and poorly managed, as PHC doctors are not trained to oversee them. Health data are
collected at all levels of the primary care system. They include both qualitative and quantitative
information, which is usually processed to the local health directorate level. An emergency reporting
system exists at this level, allowing the fast mobilization of resources in the event of epidemics.
However, most of the data are simply collected for onward transmission to the MOH (Directorate of
Planning). There is hardly any analysis at, or feedback of information to, the local level, the data
collected are frequently not sufficiently utilized at the central level, and epidemiological reporting is
difficult to use as the classification of diseases is too wide and ambiguous2'. Finally, no standard
forms exist for handling patient personal data at the primary care level, and the exchange of
information between primary care facilities and hospitals is deficient.
2. Hospital care
2.06          Hospital care is provided by 18 MOH hospitals, a separate network of 8 military
hospitals managed by the Royal Medical Services (RMS), Jordan University Hospital (JUH), and
about 26 private sector hospitals. Although the medical care provided in MOH hospitals is usually
correct, the quality of care in the RMS, JUH and private sector hospitals is generally higher than in
MOH facilities.
2.07          Table 2.01 below provides a summary of the number of hospital beds in 1991. As
the table shows, the Northern region is substantially under served in terms of beds per unit of
population compared to the Midlands and Southern regions. This imbalance will remain even if all
currently projected additional construction up to the year 2,000 is implemented. In addition to this
2  No degree of gravity or specificity is attached to a disease; for example, a benign cough, an acute respiratory
infection in a new-born, asthma, silicosis or chronic bronchitis are all categorized as "diseases of the respiratory
system".



absolute imbalance, the main MOH hospital in the Northern Region, Princess Basma Hospital, is in a
serious state of disrepair and cannot properly serve the population of its catchment area. Its surgical
wards and operating theater are obsolete and their design does not allow for efficient infection
control. Its maternity wing is located in a converted housing building, located several miles from the
rest of the hospital, and operates in poor conditions of hygiene and safety.

million on recurrent costs and an additional JD16.5 million on capital items - a total budget for the
year of over JD47 million, or 62% of the total MOH budget of JD76.2 million.
2.09        MOH hospitals have neither independent budgets nor proper accounting systems.
Hospital directors have virtually no decision making power. They cannot spend more than US$ 15 on
their own authority; they must refer all but the most junior personnel decisions to the Director of
Hospitals at MOH headquarters; they cannot take steps to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness
of their hospitals without the approval of higher authority; they cannot change the allocation of beds
between specialties, reorganize support services, or allocate staff or money on their own initiative.
Furthermore, despite the hospital network's large total staff, most MOH hospitals are small in size
(12 of the 18 hospitals have between 10 and 86 beds); average length of stay (3.1 days) and
occupancy rates (60.2%) are low, and costs are high.
2.10        In addition to being used as primary care facilities (para 2.04), emergency services
are often unable to handle real emergencies. Facilities are located in degraded and badly located
buildings, their design is inadequate, their equipment primitive (sometimes oxygen bottles and basic
equipment are missing) and their personnel are insufficiently trained. MOH has performed a study of
hospital emergency services, and has found that services were wholly inadequate in five of Jordan's
twelve largest hospitals.

3. Maintenance
2.11         Hospital buildings are often in serious state of disrepair, and building maintenance
services are poorly equiped and organized. As regards equipment maintenance, most preventive
maintenance and repairs are contracted annually by the MOH to the Royal Scientific Society (RSS).
However, RSS does not train end-users, and their contract does not include a performance clause
defining appropriate time-based maintenance schedules. Highly sophisticated equipment (nuclear
medicine, CT scanners, dialysis equipment) is maintained by manufacturers, and dental equipment is
maintained by a MOH unit. Maintenance at the primary care level is usually deficient.
2.12         Equipment maintenance problems, especially at hospitals, are complicated by other
factors. Because of the large number of health care providers, the wide range of suppliers
represented in Jordan, and automatic selection of the lowest priced items, medical equipment is
diverse (increasing maintenance costs) and its selection is often inappropriate. Some equipment items
are too sophisticated (and costly) for the need they are supposed to cover, or for the level of user
training. Duplication is common within and among facilities. For instance, over twelve CT scanners
are available in Amman, some of them performing less than five tests per day (the break-even
threshold for a scanner is usually over 20 tests per day), while others are out of service for want of
spare parts.
2.13         There is no planning at MOH for "heavy equipment"3", nor is there adequate sharing
of sophisticated medical technologies between the public and private sectors. The private sector tends
to invest in more sophisticated technology in order to increase its client base and fees charged, and
the MOH does not intervene efficiently in that process through price regulation or quality control,
although its department of Health Insurance (para 2.21) has to pay for civil servants who are
hospitalized in the private sector. MOH equipment purchases are both overly centralized at the
Ministry level and unduly fragmented within the Ministry (at least four MOH Directorates share parts
of the responsibility for purchasing). Spare parts procurement is also performed at the central level,
leading to excess inventories of spares for certain equipment while other equipment may lie idle for
months, as hospital directors have no authorization to buy spares or supplies locally. Lacking
systematic inventories of equipment, and in the absence of budgetary and planning procedures (para
2.09), hospitals have grown accustomed to submitting annually inflated lists of equipment and spares
in the hope that some of their needs might be covered by the supply they receive. As a result, they
receive and store equipment they do not need, while some of their units must operate under severe
handicaps for want of critical spares or equipment.
C. MOH Orianization and manafement
1. Management structure.
2.14          MOH suffers from serious organizational and management deficiencies which in turn
have led to inefficient and low quality service provision. Despite the existence of local health
3  'Heavy equipment" is usually defined as expensive and sophisticated equipment likely to require additional physical
and human investment and creating expensive recurrent costs. Such heavy equipment may include CT Scanners,
radiotherapy equipmnent, etc. In several countries, their installation requires a MOH authorization.



-9-
directorates, management is over-centralized at MOH headquarters in Amman. Similarly at
headquarters, despite a plethora of departments, decision-taking is heavily centralized at the level of
the Secretary General and the Minister. There is little accountability and delegation of authority
below these highest levels of management. The Minister personally approves the hiring of any staff
with earnings of over JD 90; all other recruitments must be made by the Secretary General. Financial
authority is similarly centralized, with, e.g. local health directorates' authority to authorize
expenditures limited to JD 100 (US$ 150). Meanwhile management information and accounting
systems are extremely weak; most accounting procedures are manual and computers are scarce even
in financial departments. Lack of accountability, overlapping task assignments and unclear job
descriptions for units of management and the individuals working within them have further
compounded the problems facing the Ministry in administering the services for which it is
responsible, and have produced a decision-making environment that is slow and ineffective.
2. Staffing
2.15        Ouality of MOH Personnel. The quality of MOH medical staff is adversely affected
by income discrepancies between the public and private sectors, and between different groups of
public sector practitioners (with military and University doctors receiving higher pay than MOH
doctors). As a result, MOH tends not to attract the most talented doctors; many practitionners in
PHCs in particular have received what is perceived to be as inadequate training overseas in countries
with professional standards and levels of patient care that may differ substantially from those expected
by Jordanians. In the hospital sector, although over 100 doctors have graduated in hospital
management from Jordan University, only a very few MOH hospital directors have had any formal
training in management. The quality of MOH nursing staff is also uneven: while some highly
qualified nurses are available in the hospital sector, primary care facilities mostly rely on "practical
nurses", i.e. nurses without any real training, whose contribution to health care delivery is at best
marginal, and on whose training PHC doctors spend a sizeable amount of their time.
2.16        Staffing Levels. MOH has a very large staff for its client population. Administrative
staffing is particularly heavy, amounting to about 3,200 persons, or 20% of total staffing. Hospital
staff (6,800) account for just over 40% of the total, while the underutilized primary care network
accounts for another 6,200 staff or nearly 40%. PHC staffing consists of 700 doctors, 300 associated
professionals (specialists, dentists, pharmacists), about 3,700 paramedical staff and about 1,500 non-
qualified ancillary staff. Applying a generally accepted ratio of 3 paramedical and ancillary staff per
professional provides an indication of the substantial overstaffing in the system. The combination of
overstaffing and low quality both adds substantially to MOH's costs and hinders badly needed service
upgrading.
D. Costs and Fdnancing
2.17        Health Sector Costs. Total public and private sector spending on health care
increased from 6% of total GDP in 1979 to 8.5% in 1991 (see fig.2.01 page 4), and public sector
expenditure increased from 3.1 % to 3.7% of GDP over the same period. The private health care
sector accounts for more than 50% of total sector expenditure (about half of this private expenditure
is accounted for by purchases of pharmaceuticals). In the public sector, user fees (para 2.19) and
deductions from civilian and military employees' salaries (para 2.21) offset some of these costs, but



- 10 -
over 80% of the estimated JD 90 million cost of public sector care in 1991 came directly from the
budget.
2.18          Hospital expenditures represent an important proportion of the MOH budget: in 1992,
they are expected to absorb 58% of recurrent expenditures and 71 % of capital investment (see Table
2.02). The cost per day of hospitalization is higher in MOH facilities than in the private sector,
suggesting poor management of MOH physical and human resources. MOH primary care per-patient
costs are also high, partly reflecting the underutilization and overstaffing of primary care facilities.
The crude average cost per PHC contact (through doctors or nurses) is JD 3.0. Even if comparisons
are not totally legitimate (the public sector has to finance non-patient related activities with its
recurrent budget), this cost figure is higher than the fees (JD 1.0 to JD 2.0) charged for a visit to a
GP in the private sector, where medical incomes are much higher.

2.19          Revenues. The existing system for user fees is inefficient and inequitable (see Annex
II for further information). MOH hospitals are free for civil servants and military personnel and their
dependents who are automatically enrolled in officially sponsored health "insurance" funds (para
2.21); hospital services are also free for the poor, the disabled and blood donors. RMS hospitals also
provide care for military personnel and their dependents free of charge. Other patients must pay fees,
but the tariff system is primitive: surgical procedures have three prices for minor, medium and major
surgery, and many procedures are priced below their actual cost. Nevertheless, many fee-paying
patients have less ability to pay than civil servants or military personnel (see below and Annex II).
PHC visits are also free to participants in civil service and military "insurance" schemes along with
the poor, the disabled and blood donors. Military personnel and dependents pay an extremely low fee
for drugs in primary care facilities. They represent over half of PHC contacts (i.e. far more than
their share of the population), and the structure of tariffs probably plays an important role in this high
proportion. Civil servants and their dependents, blood donors and disabled citizens, and the poor pay
a little more. Other patients pay fees for visits and the full price of drugs. Most of these latter
individuals have limited resources and no health insurance coverage. Many of them work for the



Government (and thus suffer from low public sector wages) but are not classified as civil servants
(and thus do not benefit from preferential fee levels).
2.20        Because both charges and collection rates are low in MOH facilities (cost recovery
totaled JD 3.9 million in hospitals and JD 1.6 million in primary care in 1991), total fees amount to
only 11 % of total recurrent costs of JD 53 million. Hospital fees have not been updated for years,
and this contributes to the poor efficiency of the cost recovery system. Controls are few, and
facilities directors have no power to recover unpaid bills. This leads to many "free riders" taking
advantage of the system.
2.21        Health Insurance. (see also Annex II). Public sector health insurance does not exist
as such in Jordan, but the term is used by the Ministries of Health and Defense to describe funds
collected from civil servants and military personnel, and earmarked for health care. Civil servants
pay a premium, which is collected by the Department of Health Insurance of the MOH; these premia,
totaling JD 4.1 million in 1991, and the fees recovered in health facilities, JD 5.5 million in 1991,
comprise the non-budgetary resources of the MOH. Military personnel also pay a premium to a fund
managed by the Royal Medical Services (RMS). Neither scheme has assets, neither is based on
actuarial or risk analyses, and both only cover a marginal share of costs. There is also a discrepancy
between the two schemes, whereby the level of contribution for civil servants is 2% of basic salary
with a ceiling contribution of JD 8.0 per month, but military personnel pay a contribution amounting
to only 1 .1 % of their basic salary, with a ceiling contribution of only JD 1.5 per month.
E. Planning and Policy Makidn
2.22        In principle, MOH is responsible for setting health policies for the Kingdom. In
practice, however, the Ministry has tended to operate reactively and as one among several day-to-day
service providers; it has developed almost no capacity for strategic planning and development of new
approaches to Jordan's health needs in the 1990s and beyond. MOH's planning function was part of
a Directorate of Training and Planning until February 1992, when a separate Directorate was
established. Planning for investment has hitherto focused almost entirely on basic quantitative
analysis, with inadequate consideration of recurrent costs, qualitative aspects, or longer term issues or
needs.
F. Government and Bank Strategies for the Sector
2.23        Because of Jordan's difficult medium term economic situation, the current 8.5% share
of health expenditures in Government expenditure may be hard to maintain. The macroeconomic
outlook over the next 5 to 10 years constrains increased per capita budgetary expenditure in all areas
including health, while population growth (aggravated by the impact of returnees) remains a burden
for the health system. At the same time, however, both Government and Bank strategies at the
national and sectoral levels emphasize the need to maintain and enhance the quality of service
provision in the human resources sector, including health, and to ensure the access of the poor to a
basic network of social services.
2.24        The Bank has agreed to work with the Government on formulating a new overall
strategy for the social sectors, including health, as a basis for future policy development and



- 12 -
investment. Meanwhile, the Government has sought the Bank's help in undertaking urgent health
service enhancements in the short term while undertaking major organizational and managerial
reforms designed to improve the efficiency and quality of MOH health care provision over the longer
term. The proposed project both supports existing Government and Bank strategies for service
improvement with cost containment, and is expected to be in line with any new initiatives likely to
emerge from the social sectors strategy exercise. Finally, the project enhances the quality of the
social safety net for Jordanians unable to afford private sector care.
2.25        Previous Bank Lending in the Sector and Lessons Learned. The only stand-alone
Bank operation in the health sector is the US$13.5 million Primary Health Care Project (Loan 2531-
JO of April 1985). This project (to close in May 1993) supports refurbishing of 9 existing PHCs and
the establishment of 25 new ones, together with the conversion of 4 existing PHCs into CHCs. In
addition, funds were provided for strengthening community health, population and nutrition
education, and for project evaluation and research. The project is virtually complete but has faced
problems in under utilization of facilities, and is expected to have an undisbursed balance of US$ 4-5
million by the Closing Date. Key lessons learned from that operation and taken into account in
designing the proposed project are: the need to focus far more attention on upgrading of service
quality through staff training, as opposed to expanding facilities networks; and the need to overcome
problems of delayed and haphazard equipment delivery through integration of project management
into the day-to-day operations of the Ministry under the overall guidance of the Secretary General.
2.26        Other operations with components supporting the health sector include: (i) the FY82
Fourth Education Project (Loan 2068-JOR), which financed the construction of a training institute for
nurses, midwives and medical technicians in Irbid; (ii) the FY85 Second Urban Development Project
(Loan 2587-JOR), which financed the construction of two health centers; (iii) the FY85 Manpower
Development Project (Loan 2633-JOR) which supported the establishment of a training center for
health personnel in Zarka; and (iv) the FY91 Emergency Recovery Project (Loan 3306-JOR) which
provided some financing for additional medical personnel and maintenance services in the wake of the
Gulf Crisis. Progress on these projects has been satisfactory.
2.27        Role of Other Donors. The health sector in Jordan is being supported by several
bilateral donors and multilateral agencies, including the EC, USAID, GTZ, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA
and UNRWA. The EC has financed the construction of PHC centers in the Kerak Directorate and
supports water and environment related activities with beneficial public health implications. USAID
has financed several programs to help reduce population growth, including an ongoing program of
social marketing of birth spacing; it has also supported the training of primary care nurses, and has
started implementing a family health program. GTZ has financed the establishment of the Medical
Equipment Training Center at King Hussein Medical Center, which trains medical maintenance
technicians for both the military and civilian hospital services. UNICEF is sponsoring a range of
mother and child oriented programs, and supports various NGOs in primary care and family planning.
It has started (in 1992) a family health program, to be developed over the next five years. WHO has
set up a Regional Center for environmental health activities in Jordan. UNFPA supports the
expansion of MCH and family planning activities, and plans to help establish a new population
census. UNRWA has an important role in primary and specialized care (see para 2.03), and supports
health-related education activities targeted towards Palestinian refugees.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
1. Objectives
3.01        Proiect objectives. The project is designed to enhance the health status of the
population through (a) qualitative improvements in MOH primary and hospital services, and (b)
reform of MOH organization, management, finances and planning capacity.
2. Description
3.02        The project will finance technical assistance, fellowships, training, teaching
equipment, health facility construction and renovation, computer hardware and software, and medical
and office equipment, for the following five components:
(a) A service upgrading component (US$5.4 million base cost, paras 3.04 - 3.09);
(b) A facilities improvement component (US$15.7 million base cost, paras 3.10 - 3.14);
(c) An organization and management component (US$2.2 million base cost, paras 3.15 - 3.20);
(d) A financing and cost recovery component (US$1.2 million base cost, paras 3.21 - 3.26);
(e) A long term planning component (US$0.8 million base cost, paras 3.27 - 3.32).
3. Status of Project Preparation
3.03        A substantial amount of work on the project has been undertaken by an MOH Reform
Action Group. As a result, components (a) and (c) are ready for implementation. Component (b) is

VI (Equipment financed under the project), VII (Salt hospital pilot program), VIII (Terms of
Reference for engineering services), IX (Organization of maintenance services), X (Reorganization of
the Ministry of Health), XI (Terms of Reference for the study of MOH staffing), XII (Terms of
Reference for the study of MOH fees), XIII (Terms of Reference for the study of epidemiological
trends and health priorities) and XIV (Terms of Reference for the study of health financing and
universal health insurance coverage).



- 14 -
B. Project Components
1.    MOH Services Upgrading
(Estimated base cost: US$5.4 million)
3.04        Objective. To enhance the quality and cost-efficiency of primary and hospital health
care service delivery, by: (a) upgrading the primary care system, emphasizing family planning and
mother and child health, prevention and community health (including out-reach activities); (b)
introducing new management procedures in MOH hospitals which will allow for cheaper services,
increased productivity and better quality of care; and (c) informing the population about the
appropriateness of using PHCs as the first points of contact with the health care system in order to
increase use of primary care services and reduce the pressure on hospital OPDs, and about other
major health issues, including those related to family planning.
3.05        Description. The main portion of this component will reorganize MOH primary
health care services and upgrade their staff. Under the reorganized structure, primary care and public
health services will be managed and monitored by three new Health Authorities to be established at
the regional level rather than from MOH headquarters, but with the central level retaining
responsibility for planning, training and policy making (paras 3.16 and 3.17). Medical services will
be shared between PHCs and CHCs, while the role of VHCs will be reassessed, with a view to
closing VHCs with the lowest utilization levels or performance standards. PHCs will integrate all
remaining self-standing MCH centers and doctors will be required to perform outreach activities
towards the population (family planning, health education, home calls, enhanced involvement in
schools, etc.). Community involvement in PHC management will be formalized, with active
participation of municipal authorities in the administration of the centers. CHCs will rely on the
services of full-time GPs and will also draw on the services of part-time hospital specialists, whose
working conditions will be improved during the first year of the project in order to make their
practice in CHCs more attractive and rewarding. CHCs will be able to deal with emergencies (and to
perform normal deliveries), but their in-patient function will disappear, as they are not organized for
round-the-clock service to patients.
3.06        PHC centers, which are the backbone of the primary care system, will be under the
responsibility of general practitioners, with a specialization in family and community health, and will
no longer be in charge of activities they are not able to monitor, such as water, food and sanitation
monitoring. These "non patient-related" activities will be under the direct responsibility of the three
new Regional Health Authorities. The general practitioners (GPs) charged with managing PHCs will
be expected to provide at their centers comprehensive mother and child health, family planning and
preventive care services, along with basic epidemiological information gathering. The new emphasis
put on family planning by the MOH (the new MOH charter explicitly mentions population control as
one of its priorities: para 1.10), and upgrading of MCH/FP to the level of a Directorate under the
MOH reorganization (para 3.16), will be reflected in increased family planning efficiency at the
grass-roots level of primary care centers. In order to improve the capacity of PHC staff, MOH will
launch a major retraining program for 540 PHC GPs and 400 PHC nurses and midwives emphasizing
MCH/FP, which will take advantage of the well-established training programs operated by the
University of Jordan and the Institute for Specialized Nursing Studies (Annex III).
3.07        In order to overcome management problems at MOH hospitals (para 2.09) and
improve service provision, the project will support a new decentralized hospital management system.
------------_



- 15 -
Under this system, all MOH hospitals will be placed under the authority of directors fully trained in
hospital management, responsible for the preparation and execution of their budget and accountable to
the three new Regional Health Authorities. The new system will give individual hospital directors the
authority to reallocate bed use, appoint and manage personnel, spend part of their budget on their
own authority and retain a portion of locally generated revenues. Management committees will be set
up to advise each hospital director in the course of his duties. Hospital management support systems
financed under the project will include a management information system and systems for financial
planning, budgeting and cost accounting, personnel management, clinical records and maintenance.
These systems will be developed during the first two years of the project in a pilot demonstration
hospital (Salt hospital), which will later be used as a center of development and training for
implementation of the new systems at other hospitals. Annex VII describes in detail the pilot
program and plans for its replication.
3.08        Improvement of primary care services and expected changes in the structure of fees
charged in health far.ilities (para 3.23) are designed to change clients' perceptions of the relative roles
of primary care and hospital services, with the aim of improving PHC utilization rates and reducing
pressure on hospital OPDs (para 2.04). Nevertheless, MOH considers that specific efforts need to be
made to improve communication with the public at large on this issue; hence, specific information,
education and communication (IEC) programs will be developed during the second year of the project
and implemented during the third and fourth years of the project, designed to convey the message that
it is appropriate, both in terms of quality of care and cost, to use MOH primary care facilities as a
first contact point with the health system. Specific IEC programs will also be developed for primary
care facilities on topics such as family planning, sexually transmitted diseases, tobacco consumption
and nutrition.
3.09        Activities to be financed. The project will support the quality improvement of public
sector health facilities through: skills upgrading of medical, paramedical and managerial personnel
through local training (US$3.1 million) and fellowships abroad (US$0.1 million); primary care and
hospital management equipment such as computers and software (US$1.0 million); technical
assistance to training institutions and to Salt hospital (US$1.1 million); and a series of information,
education and communication programs (US$0.2 million).
2.     MOH Facilities Improvement
(Estimated base cost: US$15.7 million)
3.10        Objective. To improve the quality of hospital services through (i) the rehabilitation of
seriously substandard facilities at the most important hospital in the Northern Region, and master-
planning for the main MOH hospital in the Midlands, (ii) the upgrading of emergency services at five
other hospitals and (iii) provision of new maintenance and storage facilities, reorganization of
maintenance services, and creation of a maintenance management system.
3.11        Description. (i) Hospital rehabilitation. This subcomponent will address the problem
of hospital obsolescence and unsanitary conditions in the Northern region (para 2.07) by supporting
the rehabilitation of Princess Basma Hospital in Irbid as follows: construction of a new building on
the hospital site, to include maternity and general surgery departments, renovation of circulations
between existing departments; and upgrading of some medical equipment (see Annex VIII). Princess
Basma hospital (a) is a priority case in tenns of obsolescence of its facilities, (b) has a large



- 16 -
catchment area and serves a population of over half a million, (c) is not in competition against private
hospitals and, (d) is located in an area where the bed/population ratio is particularly low (para 2.07
and table 2.01). In the Midlands area, the Government of Jordan wishes to upgrade Al Bashir
hospital in Amman. Al-Bashir hospital has undergone several partial upgradings during recent years,
and buildings have been added on the site in an unplanned fashion. Future developments for this
public hospital (the largest in Jordan) are being considered by the MOH, but can only take place after
a comprehensive master-plan taking into account population and activity projections, land availability,
technology assessment, catchment, etc. for the hospital. The project will finance that study, which
will require the services of a foreign consultant.
3.12         (ii) Emergency Services. At present, MOH hospital emergency services tend to be
overcrowded with outpatients who use them as a primary care facility, (para 2.04), with the result
that real emergencies do not receive adequate care. In addition,the efficient operation of emergency
services in some areas is hampered by lack of adequate personnel, equipment and organization (para
2.10). The project will help re-target emergency services towards actual medical and surgical
emergencies, through stricter screening of emergency cases and introduction of a triaging function in
emergency rooms. The efficiency of services will be improved through provision of better equipment
and operation of emergency services and improved circulations for patients. The MOH has conducted
a preliminary study of medical emergency services, and has identified five hospitals4' in need of
emergency room upgrading and equipment improvement, which will be financed through the project.
The project will also support specialized training for emergency room personnel, based on a detailed
curriculum which will be available by the start of project implementation.
3.13         (iii) Maintenance and Storage. The project will help handle the maintenance problems
identified in paras 2.11-2.13 by supporting the improvement of facilities and equipment maintenance,
and medical equipment storage through the construction and equipment of 12 hospital maintenance
workshops in the larger MOH hospitals (hospitals of less than 50 beds would not be covered), and of
two regional maintenance centers (which will also take care of maintenance needs at smaller hospitals
and primary care facilities), one covering the Northern region and one covering the Midlands and
Southern regions, together with training for specialized engineers and technicians. This sub-
component will help reduce the need for costly new investment (and thus improve cost-efficiency of
hospital and primary care operations) and strengthen local capacity to maintain and manage medical
equipment. Hospital workshops will handle general maintenance of buildings, undertake day-to-day
maintenance of medical equipment, keep basic spares (bulbs, fuses, etc.), and help improve the
general availability of equipment in MOH hospitals. Decentralized Maintenance Divisions in the new
Regional Health Authorities will set up a national maintenance management system designed to keep
inventories of equipment, centralize technical documentation, manage basic stocks of spare parts, and
establish a system of preventive and routine maintenance, including repairs of simple equipment.
Maintenance of sophisticated equipment will remain under the responsibility of the Royal Scientific
Society and/or private sector firms as at present, but the project will finance training and consultancy
services that will establish new policy and operational guidelines to enhance the quality of these
4   The MOH survey concluded that the five following hospitals needed major upgrading of their emergency room
facilities and equipment: Jerash, Zarqa, Ajlun, Abou Obeida and Madaba. In Ajiun hospital, it has been decided that
a master-plan of the facility would be needed before any decision be taken regarding additional constructions and
services upgrading. The project would finance this master-plan.

"external" maintenance services. Annex IX provides details of maintenance tasks at the different
levels of the new MOH organization.
3.14        Activities to be financed. The project will finance the construction and rehabilitation
of Princess Basma hospital (US$11.3 million), rehabilitation of emergency units in five hospitals
(US$0.6 million), and construction of maintenance workshops in 12 hospitals and of two regional
maintenance centers cum medical equipment warehouses (US$1.0 million). It will also finance
imported equipment for these facilities (US$2.0 million), together with local training for emergency
room personnel and maintenance personnel (US$0.5 million) and overseas fellowships for
maintenance personnel (US$0.2 million) and some foreign specialist services (US$0.1 million).
3.    MOH Organization and Management
(estimated base cost: US$2.2 million)
3.15        Objective. To enable MOH to become an effective policymaking, management and
planning agency, and to devolve day-to-day operation of MOH services to the regional level.
3.16        Description. This component will help overcome the managerial weaknesses
summarized in para 2.14 by supporting a reorganization of the Ministry of Health that emphasizes
improved management and planning at the center and greater operational authority at the regional
level. Under the reorganization (which has been approved by the Jordanian Cabinet), five major
functions will remain at the central level, under the responsibility of Assistant Secretaries General: (i)
policy planning, (ii) administration and personnel management, (iii) services and supplies
management, (iv) quality control and assurance and, (v) technical and professional affairs, in charge
of policy-oriented and/or specialized programs (such as family planning, environmental and
occupational health, pharmacy, etc.). Day-to-day management of health services provided to the
public (primary care, including MCH/FP and community medicine, public health and hospital care)
will be devolved to the regional level. Management support systems will be developed at the central
and decentralized levels: new personnel management systems (including job descriptions and
personnel records), management budgeting and financial planning systems, accounting systems,
medical record systems, etc. will be introduced in order to improve decision making, and improve the
span of control at all levels of the MOH administration.
3.17        Under the new organization, three Regional Health Authorities will be created (in the
North, the Midlands, and the South), each under the responsibility of a Regional Assistant Secretary
General. The regional level will be in charge of administration and control of primary care and
Hospital services organization and monitoring of the referral system between the primary and
hospital levels and management of public health services. This structure will avoid the present split
between primary and secondary care (at present, PHCs are controlled by 16 Health Directorates in
Govemorates, whereas hospitals report to the MOH headquarters Directorate of Hospitals), and help
establish a "continuum of care" for patients. It will also improve the efficiency of public health
services by placing them under a competent Regional authority instead of making PHC doctors
responsible for them as at present. Each regional authority will have Directorates for primary and
public health, hospitals, planning and finance, administration and personnel, supplies, and
technical/professional affairs.



- 18 -
3.18        Annex X gives additional detail on MOH reorganization: implementation will be
phased in a series of steps during the first two years of project implementation. Transitional
arrangements for the regionalization process have already been worked out by the MOH, and the
duties and responsibilities of Assistant Secretaries General have already been defined. During
negotiations, assurances were given that the reorganization would be implemented in line with the
Project Implementation Schedule (Annex XVI) and completed by March, 1995. (para 6.02(a)).
3.19        As part of the reorganization, MOH will also address staffing and personnel
productivity issues through a study to be completed during the first eighteen months of project
implementation. The study will explore a range of options, including (a) reallocating currently under-
utilized personnel in Health Directorates to positions where their skills could be better used, (b)
retraining staff to improve productivity, (c) reducing hiring for clerical and intermediate positions and
(d) improving the capacity of the personnel function to deal with contractual staff (and reduce
redundancies through attrition and non-renewal of some contracts). Agreed terms of reference for the
study are given in Annex XI. During negotiations, assurances were given that the staffing study will
commence by September 30, 1993 and that, by January 31, 1995, its findings will have been
reviewed by the Government and the Bank and a timetable for implementing agreed recommendations
will have been determined by the Government and the Bank (para. 6.02(b)).
3.20        Activities to be financed. The project will support the reorganization of MOH
through the provision of fellowships abroad for key MOH personnel (US$0.4 million); technical
assistance in public administration and management (US$0.8 million); and office equipment at the
central and regional levels (US$1.0 million).
4.    MOH Financing and Cost Recovery
(Estim.ted base cost: US$1.2 million)
3.21        Obiective. To reduce the dependence of health sector financing on the budget, to
contain the escalation of health care costs in the public sector without threatening access of the
population (and especially the poor) to the health care system, and to improve the organization and
management of the MOH health insurance fund.
3.22        Description. This component will support (a) interim improvements in cost recovery,
to be implemented during the project, based on a study of short term options for reducing distortions
and inequities in the current structure of fees, selective fee increases and improved fee collection. (b)
better administration of MOH's health insurance fund, mainly through training of personnel and
improvement of information processing technology and, (c) new initiatives to evaluate unit costs of
MOH services and develop a rational new systemwide fee structure in line with them.
3.23        Although cost recovery in MOH health facilities exists in principle, the structure of
fees collected is both illogical and inequitable (Annex II), with the result that it provides incentives for
patients to seek hospital care rather than attend primary care facilities, encourages undue prescription
and use of drugs, and has the perverse effect that some less well off patients end up paying more than
some better off categories of the population. Furthermore, the absence of mechanisms and incentives
for health facilities to recover costs means that even existing fees are often not collected. MOH has
already (i) designed an incentive plan for doctors and health facilities that should improve fee
collection in the medium term and (ii) raised charges in hospitals to patients who do not pay civil



- 19 -
service or military health insurance premia, in order to decrease the burden these patients represent
on the MOH budget. The Government and the Bank have also agreed that MOH should take further
early steps to rationalize the structure of fees and improve cost recovery by amending charges in the
primary care and hospital sectors in order to (a) create a gradient of fees between primary and
secondary care, and (b) protect the poor against the effects of higher charges to patients, on the basis
of a study (see agreed terms of reference in Annex XII) to be completed during the first eighteen
months of project implementation. Meanwhile, the Government has agreed to a series of preliminary
fee adjustments, that will satisfy conditions (a) and (b) above while raising MOH cost recovery by an
initial 10%. During negotiations, assurances were given that the cost recovery study will commence
by August 31, 1993, so that by January 31, 1995, its findings will have been reviewed by the
Government and the Bank and a timetable for implementating agreed recommendations will have been
determined by the Government and the Bank (para 6.02(b)).
3.24        The project will also support improved management at the MOH Directorate of Health
Insurance, which manages fees recovered in health facilities and collects health insurance premiums
from civil servants. At present this Directorate has an outmoded management and accounting system,
and lists of insured personnel and their dependents are not computerized (its computerized equipment
can only be used to produce "insurance cards"). Hence, coverage overlaps are frequent. The project
will help implement a system that will make it possible to keep track of beneficiaries covered by the
MOH scheme and remove double coverage (see Annex II). The project will also help improve the
management of beneficiary expenditures covered by the Directorate of Health Insurance (especially as
regards fees charged by the private sector) and its participation in covering operational expenses of
MOH facilities.
3.25        This component, together with the implementation of adequate management
procedures in MOH health facilities, will allow the MOH to study unit costs of procedures, both
preventive and curative, in primary care centers and hospitals. This analysis will in turn allow MOH
to develop a rational structure of user fees on which to base programs of cost containment in the
health sector over the medium term.
3.26        Activities to be financed. The project will finance overseas fellowships (US$0.1
million) and foreign specialist services (US$0. 1 million) in cost analysis and health insurance,
together with computers and software for MOH's Directorate of Health Insurance (US$1.0 million).
5.    MOH Long Term Planning
(Estimated base cost: US$0.8 million)
3.27        Objectives. To help MOH to design a long term health strategy for the country, by
(a) providing better information about and analysis of expected health priorities for the population and
(b) exploring options for improving health sector financing, including the possible development of a
national health insurance scheme.
3.28        Description. The project will support two major studies designed to support strategic
planning in the health sector: the first study will identify epidemiological patterns in the population
and determine priority actions to be recommended in the medium and long term; the second study
will propose alternative health financing policies and determine the feasibility of introducing a



- 20 -
comprehensive national health insurance scheme and identify prerequisites and steps for its
implementation.
3.29        Jordan's health care system as a whole (public and private) is facing major challenges
because of growing epidemiological diversity as a consequence of declining fertility, better control of
infectious diseases and increased chronic diseases among adults. In order to adapt the health system's
response to these problems during and beyond the 1990s, Jordanian health planners need to undertake
an epidemiological and economic analysis of major disease trends and issues, evaluating the cost-
effectiveness of alternative intervention strategies in order to make well-founded recommendations to
the Government about future prevention and treatment strategies and costs. Jordan lacks information
about most major non-infectious diseases, and its capacity in epidemiological and economic analyses
needs strengthening. The project will support a study (see agreed terms of reference in Annex XIII)
of new epidemiological trends in Jordan and of how the health system reacts to them, which will
build a stronger base for health policy design in the future. The study will be undertaken by study
teams appointed by MOH with the help of the Jordanian Department of Statistics and foreign technical
assistance to be provided under the project.
3.30        The second study will analyze the present system of financing health care in Jordan,
and will determine the feasibility of a national health insurance system for the whole Jordanian
population (existing schemes are summarized in Annex II). It will determine: the acceptable levels of
expenditure per unit of population, its distribution between insurance financed funds and co-payments;
the types of preventive and curative interventions to be covered and at what level (prevention,
primary care, hospital care, rehabilitation, long-stay institutions, drugs, etc.); the type of cost control
measures that will be necessary to keep the system operating and their influence on the public/private
mix of health delivery, the level of health insurance premiums and the way they should be calculated
(i.e. based on salaries, actual income, or some alternative measure) and managed (i.e. through the
normal channels of public administration, a new public sector corporation, or a mix of public and
private management). Agreed terms of reference are provided in Annex XIV. This study will be
performed under the leadership of the Ministry of Planning, with inputs from Jordan University, the
Social Security Corporation and the MOH Directorate of Health Insurance, and with foreign technical
assistance to be provided under the project.
3.31        Methodology development for the first study will be undertaken during the second
year of project implementation with the assistance of the Department of Statistics. The second study
will commence at the beginning of the second year of the project implementation. Preliminary
findings will be available for Bank review and comment by October 1996 for the first study, and by
May 1997 for the second, allowing, if appropriate, the introduction of some of the findings into the
mid-term review of the Bank project and subsequent stages of implementation. Final reports will be
available by the end of the fourth year, and two national seminars will be organized at the beginning
of the fifth year to review the findings of the two studies, discuss their proposals, and make
recommendations to the Government regarding health planning priorities, investment programs and
insurance schemes. During negotiations, assurances were given that the studies will be conducted in
line with the terms of reference in Annex XIII and XIV and the above timetable, and by teams
acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.02(c)).
3.32        Activities to be financed. The project will finance local experts in epidemiological
surveying (US$0.1 million), overseas fellowships in epidemiology and health insurance administration
(US$0.2 million), foreign specialist services in epidemiology and insurance study methodology



- 21 -
(US$0.2 million), computers and software for both studies and vehicles for the epidemiology study
(US$0.3 million).

through financing for training, fellowships, specialist services and equipment is expected to account
for US$ 2.2 million equivalent, or 9% of base costs. Support for improvement of MOH financing
and cost recovery consisting of funding for training, fellowships, specialist services and office
equipment is expected to cost US$1.2 million or 5% of base costs. Long Term studies, including

Note: Itras may not add to total due to rounding
4.04          Basis of Cost Estimates. Costs of the construction and renovation of the Princess
Basma Hospital and emergency units are based on reviews of recently awarded contracts for
comparable facilities at the new (1991) Al Tafileh MOH hospital and at the 1992 extension of the
private Palestine Hospital in Amman. Equipment costs for all major pieces of hospital equipment
have been estimated on the basis of priced equipment lists and specifications. Other equipment costs
have been calculated on the basis of mission estimates. Technical assistance unit costs (US$16,000
per man-month of specialist services and US$ 2,500 for fellowships) have been estimated on the basis
of recent prices for comparable technical assistance in the Primary Health Project (Loan 2531-JO) and
the Human Resources Development Sector Investment Loan (Loan 3106-JO). The man-month costs
of specialists include housing, relocation costs, salaries, subsistence, office services, fees, overheads
and recruitment costs. Detailed descriptions of the project's training and technical assistance
components are given in Annexes III, IV and V. Base cost estimates reflect prices as projected for
the time of negotiations (February, 1993).
4.05          Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component of base costs was
estimated as follows: (a) civil works construction and rehabilitation: 57%; (b) medical and office
equipment: 90%; (c) foreign specialist services: 72%; (d) fellowships: 95%; and (e) local training:
0%, and local consultancy: 9%. These percentages have been determined by: (a) estimating the



- 23 -
indirect foreign exchange of construction; and (b) assuming that all equipment will be imported.
Including contingencies, the resulting foreign exchange component is estimated at US$18.2 million, or
about 61 % of total costs.
4.06        Customs Duties and Taxes. Project costs include an estimated US$1.2 million in
indirect taxes on locally procured civil works and goods. Equipment and goods imported directly for
use by Government ministries are exempt from duties and taxes.
4.07        Construction Costs and Areas per Hospital Bed. Based on recent construction
works for equivalent buildings, the cost per square meter has been estimated at JD300 for "non
technical" buildings (such as workshops), and JD400 for "technical" facilities (new hospital
buildings). Rehabilitation costs have been estimated on the basis of JD200 per renovated square
meter. The areas for hospital beds in the maternity and part of the surgery wards for Princess Basma
Hospital have been calculated on the basis of 60 sqm per bed, a low average for a hospital of that size
(between 200 and 300 beds). This includes all technical, administrative and general services.
4.08        Contingency Allowances. Project costs include an allowance for physical
contingencies (US$2.5 million), equal to 10% of total base costs. Price contingencies between
negotiations (February 1993) and the end of project implementation are estimated at US$2.1 million
equivalent, or 8% of base cost plus physical contingencies. International inflation rates are estimated
at 3.8% throughout the project period. Local inflation rates are estimated at 4.5% for 1993 followed
by annual rates of 4.4% for 1994, 4.3% for 1995, and 4.0% thereafter.
4.09        Recurrent Costs. The project's focus on management, productivity and efficiency
improvements means that it will have a positive effect on recurrent costs (which will be substantial in
the case of some components) in terms of providing improved services from the same or smaller
amounts of resources.
- the MOH reorganization component will save recurrent costs by reducing the number of regional
administrative offices and rationalizing the use of headquarters and regional administrative staff.
Computerization of management systems should also produce net savings.
- the primary and hospital care upgrading component includes redistribution of staff at PHCs and
should also save recurrent costs, by increasing both demand and productivity at PHCs and thereby
reducing demand for costly hospital services. Higher demand for PHC services might increase
recurrent costs for laboratory and X-Ray services and drugs, but the health financing component (see
below and Annex XII) will offset this effect by higher fees and better fee collection.
- the facilities improvement component will not create additional hospital beds, as the construction
of new buildings in Princess Basma Hospital will involve transfer of wards from one building to
another and the provision of new surgical facilities to replace existing unhygienic ones. The present
personnel ratio of nearly 4 staff per bed is sufficient and no additional personnel will be needed to
operate the rehabilitated facility. Facilities improvement at Princess Basma hospital is likely to
increase demand and hence the bed occupancy rate, the resulting incremental recurrent costs (about
JD 130,000 a year at an 80% occupancy rate) will be small and will be offset by improved fee
collection. The additional recurrent costs generated by the introduction of regional maintenance
centers will amount to about JD 80,000 a year and will be more than compensated for by fewer



- 24 -
breakdowns and less equipment outage resulting from better preventive and curative maintenance and
better management of spare parts.
- the sector financng and cost recovery component will help raise non-budgetary financing for
recurrent costs. A better targeted fee policy will help decrease the population's demand for hospital
services and encourage more appropriate referrals, thus leading to savings in recurrent costs.
- the two long term studies will not require additional MOH recurrent costs for implementation. In
terms of outcomes, the health insurance study will be targeted towards containing recurrent costs in
the future and finding better and increasingly non-budgetary ways to finance them. The study of
epidemiological patterns and health priorities might lead to the creation of additional research capacity
within MOH over the medium term, but this will not significantly raise recurrent costs.
B. Proiect Financmng.
4.10        The project financing plan is shown in Table 4.03. Including contingencies, the
proposed Bank loan of US$20.0 million will finance about 67% of total costs. Parallel cofinancing of
US$ 2.4 million, provided in grant form, will finance about 8% of total costs, and the Government
contribution of US$7.6 million will cover the remaining 25 %.
4.11        Retroactive financing. In order to permit the MOH to complete final equipment
lists, to facilitate the completion of appropriate technical assistance arrangements, and to facilitate the
further development of project preparation activities, retroactive financing of up to US$0.5 million
will be included to cover the cost of equipment and specialist services necessary for timely project
start-up. Retroactive financing will be limited to expenditures incurred prior to loan signing but after
September 30, 1992.
4.12        Cofinancing agreements. The European Community would provide technical
assistance needed for the Salt pilot experiment. Technical assistance for the epidemiological study
would be financed by USAID through the supply of a CDC consultant. The German GTZ would
provide technical assistance for the implementation of MOH reorganization and management
improvements. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs would finance technical assistance in the field
of biomedical maintenance through the supply of fellowships for engineers and technicians and for
expert services in the organization of regional maintenance centers. The British ODA would finance
fellowships in health management through the British Council. The Finnish cooperation would
support technical assistance in the field of primary care and family planning training. The total
cofinancing pledges represent the equivalent of US$2.4 million. All cofinanciers have agreed to
provide funding on a parallel basis. During negotiations, assurances were received that, by August
31, 1993, the Jordanian authorities will provide the Bank with evidence indicating that the
Government of Jordan will either secure the necessary cofinancing or secure other resources to cover
any amounts of the project cofinancing not pledged by cofinanciers, in line with the implementation
schedule of the project (para 6.02 (d)).

C. Project Implementadon.
1. Procurement.
4.13          Contracts for building works will be packaged to the extent feasible on a regional
basis. Invitations to bid on medical equipment have been grouped into six major packages of goods,
each of which could be provided by one supplier. Items suitable for International Competitive
Bidding (ICB), will be procured in accordance with the Bank's May 1992 "Guidelines for
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (para 4.29), and will account for about 94% of
the total value of building works and equipment. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) is expected
to be used for the award of building contracts, estimated to cost more than US$2.0 million each, and
for equipment bids exceeding US$200,000 each. Basic bidding documents used in earlier Bank-
financed projects and acceptable to the Bank will be used for all bidding. In comparison of bids for
equipment to be procured through ICB, domestic manufacturers will be allowed a preferential margin
of 15%, or the existing customs duty whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. prices of competing imports.
Under ICB procedures, invitations to bid and the proposed award of contracts will be reviewed by the
Bank prior to final award decisions. It is estimated that this review will cover about 75% of the value
of medical and office equipment contracts (US$ 6.3 million equivalent) and about 80% of civil and
building contracts (US$8.6 million). The remaining 25 % of medical and office equipment and
civil/building contracts will be subject to selective post award reviews of about one in four contracts.
4.14          Construction Procurement. Under Jordanian law, all construction in excess of JD
100,000 must be carried out under the aegis of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). A project
architect (para 4.26(b)) will coordinate procurement activities between MPW and MOH.



- 26 -
4.15        Equipment Procurement above JD 2,000 is the responsibility of the General Supplies
Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) through Local Competitive Bidding. In the Bank's
Primary Health Care Project (Ln 2531-JO), a procurement officer of that department worked within a
Project Implementation Unit in the MOH to improve coordination. This proved to be satisfactory in
the previous project, and similar arrangements will be made under the proposed project to ensure
satisfactory coordination between MOF and MOH (para 4.26(d)).
4.16        Procurement Methods. Table 4.04 summarizes project procurement arrangements.
4.17        Exceptions to ICB are expected to be as follows:
(a) Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). will be used for small works (rehabilitation of
emergency departments -- estimated to cost less that US$0.4 million each and aggregating
about US$1.6 million), for rehabilitation works at Princess Basma Hospital as the activities to
be financed are discontinuous (US$2.0 million), and for small amounts of diverse equipment
costing less than US$200,000 in each package and aggregating about US$0.9 million.
(b)   Limited international Bidding (LIB) will be used where there is only a limited number of
suppliers. This type of procurement will be limited to an aggregate of about US$0.4 million
worth of goods.
(c)  International and Local Shopping (minimum three quotations) will be used for procuring
goods costing less than US$50,000 in each contract, subject to an overall ceiling of US$0.4
million for this type of procurement and a limited amount of d;-ect contracting where
proprietary equipment and spare parts are requested.
(d)   Procurement of Technical Assistance.
(i) With respect to consultancies for project hardware design (buildings and built-in medical
equipment, for a value of about US$0.4 million), MPW will select consultants in accordance
with criteria and procedures to be agreed with the Bank and in line with the Bank's Guidelines
for the use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency (para 4.29). To ensure adequate coordination among designers of hardware
components, two local consultants, one in hospital design, and the other in hospital equipment
installations, will be retained for a period of about twelve months each to provide advice at
critical stages throughout the project period.
(ii) MOH will package overseas specialist services and fellowships to be financed under the
project (i.e. in connection with MOH reorganization and upgrading of planning capacity,
improvement of hospital management and budgeting systems, and the two project studies) into
packages to be financed by donors under cofinancing agreements (para 4.12). Consultant
selection will be in accordance with principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank. Bank
financed contracts will be on the basis of Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, and will be reviewed by the
Bank prior to award for contracts over US$100,000 equivalent each. The Bank will review
Terms of Reference and curricula vitae of consultants for contracts financed under cofinancing
arrangements.



- 27 -
(e)    Procurement of local trainine. It is envisaged that the comprehensive local training program
for PHC staff and hospital managers will be undertaken under the auspices of specialized
health centers (for GP and management training), and the Institute of Specialized Nursing
Studies (for nurse and midwife training). Training services will be contracted directly from
with the training institutions involved.

4.19         Maintenance. Maintenance issues are discussed in para 2.11-2.13 and project
initiatives to improve building and equipment maintenance are described in para 3.13 and Annex IX.
4.20         Status of Procurement Preparation. Construction and rehabilitation of civil works
have been fully costed and detailed architectural design work (financed by the project) will be
undertaken inmmediately following Loan effectiveness. All equipment lists have been completed.
Technical specifications will be produced by MOH and reviewed by the Bank prior to tendering.
Technical assistance packages have been fully defined, draft terms of reference and tender documents
for engineering studies have been finalized (Annex VIII), and proposals will be invited immediately
following Loan effectiveness.
2. Disbursements.
4.21         The proposed project is expected to be implemented over a period of about 6.5 years,
with completion of all project activities by June 30, 2000. The Bank Loan is expected to be fully
disbursed six months thereafter: the closing date will therefore be December 31, 2000. Table 4.06
provides the disbursement schedule. The disbursement profiles for Jordan do not include a category
for health projects. The proposed disbursement profile is comparable to the standard disbursement
profile for Jordan, and is somewhat shorter than the Bank-wide profile for health projects (see Annex
XV).

Disbursements will be made against:
(a)    75 % of total expenditures on construction and rehabilitation;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported goods and ex-factory expenditures
for locally manufactured goods;
(c)    100% of foreign expenditures for technical assistance.
4.22         Disbursements against goods and services exceeding US$100,000 equivalent will be
made against normal documentation. Disbursements against contracts below that level will be made
on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), available for examination by Bank supervision
missions.



- 29 -
3. Special Account
4.23        To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish, maintain
and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account in the Central
Bank of Jordan to which the World Bank will make an initial deposit, equivalent to US$1.2 million
(about 4 months' withdrawal from the loan). The Special Account will be replenished as appropriate
when the undisbursed balance of the account falls below an amount equal to 50% or less of the
amount of the Special Account. Withdrawal applications will be supported by appropriate
documentation.
D. Proiect Management and Supernision.
4.24        Local Management Responsibilities. The proposed project will be managed and
implemented by the MOH. Overall management responsibility will rest with the Secretary General of
the MOH, assisted by experienced Project Advisers on health management and finance issues, and a
Professional and Management Development Unit (PMDU) to be created under the reorganization of
the MOH (see Annex X) to take over from the existing Reform Action Group. The Project Advisers
(whose qualifications will include experience in organizing and managing the finances of large health
systems and public sector administration) will be recruited externally under the technical assistance
component of the proposed project, for a period of 24 man-months.
4.25        Project implementation will be handled by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
headed by the Chairman of the PMDU. Establishment and staffing of the PIU will be a condition of
effectiveness of the Loan (para 6.01). The unit's responsibilities will include coordination of all
project activities, working with and obtaining feedback from project institutions, and monitoring,
evaluation and reporting to MOH management and the World Bank. A detailed project
implementation schedule is provided in Annex XVI.
4.26        Staffing: The PIU will include the following staff:
(a)    A Liaison Officer, responsible for ensuring coordination of project training and technical
assistance among MOH departments, the new Regional Health Authorities (para 3.17) and
project supported institutions;
(b)    A Project Architect, responsible for coordination of building designs, tendering, and
supervision between the MOH, the Ministry of Public Works, the end users and the designers
(para 4.14). To assist the project architect in carrying out his/her duties, the project will
include provision for about twenty four man-months of intermittent support by an experienced
outside local consultant architect with special expertise in the health field;
(c)    A Facilities and Maintenance Engineer, responsible for: (i) coordination between building
designs and equipment layouts; (ii) development of inventories and procedures for equipment
acquisition and maintenance; and (iii) coordination with respect to equipment and maintenance
matters between the Royal Scientific Society (RSS), the MPW, the MOH, the users and the
designers. To assist the engineer in carrying out his/her duties, the project will include



- 30 -
provision for about twelve man-months of intermittent support by a local facilities and
maintenance engineer fully acquainted with the current state-of-the-art in medical technology;
(d)    A Procurement Officer, (on secondment from the General Supplies Department, Ministry of
Finance: para 4.15), responsible for coordinating the preparation of tender documents, and
organizing and evaluation of tenders for equipment procurement in collaboration with staff of
the PIU, relevant MOH departments and the Ministry of Finance;
(e)    A Project Accountant, responsible for maintaining project accounts (including the Special
Account: para 4.23), preparing payment vouchers, preparing financial statements and progress
reports, and arranging for having project accounts audited in accordance with Government
and Bank requirements;
(f)    A Project Secretary, fluent in Arabic and English, will provide support functions for the
above staff.
4.27         Accounts and Audits. The Project Implementation Unit will maintain separate
accounts for the project and will prepare semi-annual progress reports on the proposed project.
Project accounts including the Special Account will be audited in accordance with the March 1982
Bank "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank", by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank (see terms of reference in Annex XVII), and the Bank
will be provided within six months of the end of each fiscal year with an audit report of such scope
and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on
disbursements against a certified statement of expenditures (para 4.29).
4.28         Bank Supervision. As noted above (para 4.26), the PIU will be responsible for
working with project institutions, and for monitoring and evaluating project implementation. The PIU
will compile semi-annual project progress reports based on its monitoring/evaluative activities, which
will be provided to the Bank as a basis for regular supervision of the project. Bank supervision
missions will be timed to take place 4-6 weeks after receipt of each semi-annual report, so as to
afford the opportunity for a comprehensive review of progress and any problems identified in the
report. This will imply ten half-yearly supervision missions over the project's expected lifespan,
starting six months after effectiveness. These missions will require the services of two staff members
per mission, drawn from the following: the task manager, an architect, a health training specialist, a
health financing specialist, and an epidemiologist, and will have an average duration of two Jordanian
working weeks (12 days) plus travel time. Because of the need to ensure timely start-up and
appropriate coordination of project components during the early stages of implementation, a project
launch mission and an additional three smaller missions will be scheduled for three, nine and 15
months after effectiveness. These missions will consist of the task manager plus an implementation
specialist and will have an average duration of one Jordanian working week (6 days), plus travel time.
A mid-term review of progress will be held at the beginning of the fourth year of implementation.
Based on this supervision plan, total supervision costs will be US$240,000 over the project's lifespan.
E. Conditionalities.
4.29         During negotiations, assurances were given (i) that procurement of goods and services
will be undertaken in line with Bank Guidelines, (ii) that disbursements against statements of



- 31 -
expenditures are adequately audited, and (iii) that project accounts, including the Special Account,
will be maintained and audited in line with Bank Guidelines by an independent auditor acceptable to
the Bank, and that audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of
each project year (para 6.02 (e)).
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits.
5.01        Project Benefits. Training PHC doctors and nurses and midwives will raise the
quality of primary care in general, and of mother and child health/family planning services in
particular, helping to further reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, and to increase rates
of contraception use. Upgrading maternity and surgical services in the largest hospital in the
Northern Region will eliminate present insanitary conditions, and help reuuce rates of infection,
morbidity and mortality. Training emergency service staff and improving their equipment will
improve the treatment and reduce the adverse after-effects of emergencies. Improved maintenance
services will reduce equipment breakdowns and yield net savings in costs. Enhanced MOH
management (including devolution of decision-making to the regional and facility levels) will improve
the quality and responsiveness to client needs of day-to-day grassroots service delivery. The sector
financing component will help lay the basis for containing public expenditure while improving equity.
The project will also help MOH develop an efficient administrative structure and prepare a long term
strategy for the sector. Finally, the project will enhance the welfare of the poor, who are
disproportionately high users of MOH services.
B. Risks.
5.02        The main risk relates to the ability of MOH to carry out its administrative reform and
decentralization program in an effective and timely manner. In addition, improved management and
grassroots service delivery will depend critically on upgrading the human resources involved; and it
may prove difficult to realize necessary improvements in cost recovery during a period of austerity.
These risks will be mitigated by (i) the careful design of the content of and timetable for MOH
reorganization, Cabinet approval of the reorganization program and advance sensitization of staff to
it; (ii) the project's substantial program of management and staff training at all levels and (iii) the
inclusion of safeguards for the poor in the project study of cost recovery options.
C. Environmental Assessment.
5.03        The project has been placed in environmental category C. Provision has been be
made in the project design for the proper disposal of sanitary, medical and laboratory waste, and for
the most economical use of water resources. The project includes the supply of incinerators,
equipment for laboratory waste treatment and training of personnel for their operation and
maintenance.

VI. AGREEMEENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01        A Condition of effectiveness for the proposed project will be as follows:
that the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established with staffing, organization and terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank (para 4.25)
6.02        During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a) MOH reorganization will be implemented in line with the Project Implementation
Schedule (Annex XVI) and completed by March 1995 (para 3.18);
(b) the MOH cost recovery study and the MOH staffing study will commence by August 31,
1993 and September 30, 1993 respectively, and that by January 31, 1995, their findings will
have been reviewed by the Government and the Bank, and a timetable for implementing
agreed recommendations will have been determined by the Government and the Bank (paras.
3.19 and 3.23);
(c) long term planning studies will be conducted in line with the terms of reference in
Annexes XIII and XIV, by study teams acceptable to the Bank (para 3.31);
(d) by August 31, 1993, the Jordanian authorities will either secure the necessary cofinancing
or provide the Bank with evidence indicating that the Government of Jordan will secure other
resources to cover any amounts of the project cofinancing not pledged by cofinanciers, in line
with the implementation schedule of the project (para 4.12).
(e) (i) procurement of goods and services will be undertaken in line with Bank Guidelines,
(ii) disbursements against statements of expenditure will be adequately audited, and (iii)
project accounts, including the Special Account, will be maintained and audited in line with
Bank Guidelines by an independent autitor acceptable to the Bank, and provided to the Bank
within six months of the end of each project year (para. 4.29).
6.03        Subject to the above conditions, the project would provide a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$20 million to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for a term of 20 years including a grace
period of five years.

ANNEX I
Population and family planning
1     Introduction
1.1          The population of the East Bank territories of Jordan was reported to be 587,000 in
1952. It was estimated to have reached 900,000 in 1961, and the second population census, realized
in 1979, showed a population size of 2.1 million (including 4.2% foreigners residing in Jordan).
Projections for subsequent years (assuming a zero net migration) led to a 3.1 million population in
1990, 5.6 million in 2010, stabilization occurring at the beginning of the 21st century at a level of
about 13.2 million. The Gulf crisis has forced a revision of the hypothesis of a zero net migration,
and the National Population Commission has produced a population estimate of 3.453 million for the
end of 1990, including part of the "returnees" evacuated from the Gulf. Until the next census, due to
occur before 1995 with support from UNFPA, population figures may lack precision, mostly because
of the variable status of immigration according to the political situation. In November 1992, the
Government gave a new estimate for 1991 of 3.88 million.
1.2          Such increases in the total number of the population point towards a very high growth
rate, partly attributable to a high fertility rate: the total fertility rate (TFR) was more than eight
children per woman in the 1960s, one of the highest figures in the world. Since the beginning of
population control activities in the early 1970s, TFR has declined to 7.7 in the 1971-1975 period, 6.6
in the 1980-85 period, and 5.6 in the 1986-1990 period. The mean number of children ever born to
women (15-49 years old) declined from 3.6 in 1976 to 3.1 in 1983 and 2.9 in 1990', and the rate of
natural increase of the population has gone down to about 3% per year. Overall fertility levels in
Jordan have declined by about 27% between the early seventies and the late eighties2. This decline
was helped by changes of the age at marriage, a lower nuptiality (the proportion of ever married
women 15-49 years of age was about 52% in 1990, from 66% in 1976 and 56% in 1983), and a
growing use of contraceptives.
1.3          Since independence, the distribution of the population has changed, with the urban
population (68%) more than doubling since 1950, and important in- and out-migrations. Political
events have let to three major in-migration streams: the first after 1948 was around 400,000, the
second after 1967 was about 350,000, and the third after 1990 was estimated at about 300,000.
Despite such population shocks, Jordan managed to achieve a high health status for its population,
with a crude death rate falling from 26 per thousand in 1950 to 6 per thousand during the 1985-1990
period, and an infant mortality rate decreasing from 160 per thousand live births in 1955 to 51 in
1991.

1.4          Awareness of population problems and need to control its growth appeared in the
early 1970s, and the first cooperation program with UNFPA started in 1976. However, official
endorsement of a population policy only came in 1988 when King Hussein first alluded to the
necessity of family planning in Jordan, and 'although population factors have been identified as
important issues to the country's economic growth and social progress, the Government has yet not
adopted an explicit population policy"'.
2      Main actors and achievements to date
2.1           Assessment of population evolution and awareness of population programs have
increased since 1975. The 1979 census led to the development of population competencies at the
Jordanian Department of Statistics. Three major fertility surveys have been undertaken since 1976
with results that can be compared: in 1976, 1983 and 1990, the latter with the help of the Institute for
Resource Development and the MOH. Demographic indicators are widely used and most

Government departrnents keep population data, and some use them as a basis for their mission, such
as the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Environment. Jordan
University has developed a Department of Population Studies, which trains high level demographers
and performs research activities. Yarmouk University has developed a course on IEC in family
planning and participates in research activities in this field. A National Population Commission has
been created, with an aim of coordinating most population related activities, and its General
Secretariat is directly linked with the throne.
2.2           An important role is played by various NGOs, both in family planning and in
promotion of women in development. The very active Jordanian Association for Family Planning and
Protection operates eight family planning clinics (three in Amman), and is the source of 30% of
modern family planning methods distributed in the Kingdom. Women in development activities are
supported by Queen Alia Fund (which sponsors the National Population Commission) and the Noor
Al Hussein Foundation, which also support famnily planning activities.

education of the population, the                :( fertility

Government and in the families (see                                  '--   '-, Z
table 1). This has in turn sharply          _                b.,
lowered fertility figures during the
last 15 years (figure).
2.4           The private health
care sector is strong in Jordan, and it performs a growing part of family planning activities, mostly
with the involvement of general practitioners, gynecologists and midwives. A high density of private
pharmacies makes contraceptives available all over the country, and a 1992 Yarmouk University
study' has showed that since the Gulf crisis contraceptives are better displayed and their use is on the
rise.
2.5           The Ministry of Health plays a relatively minor role in birth spacing activities, as they
are not placed under the supervision of one single authority with the consequence that there is no
strong focal point for family planning activities. Nevertheless, all primary care centers have
contraceptives available, have personnel with some form of awareness of family planning, and

perform mother and child health activities. Advertisements for family planning programs, breast
feeding and child nutrition can be seen in all PHCs. Still, such population related activities can be
much more actively developed in the MOH, as in spite of a large number of health centers and
hospitals all around the country, it provides only a minor fraction of family planning advice and
material.

prograrns, training, etc.), USAID supports several programs (social marketing of birth-spacing,
farnily health services, data collection and population policy), the World Bank and the ECC have
supported the extension of primary care facilities with an emphasis on MCHIFP activities, and
UNICEF and WHO also support MCHIFP (training, support to IEC programs, expansion of out-
reach activities in the case of UNICEF). Several bilateral cooperation agencies also support or intend
to support MCH/FP programs in Jordan, and the IPPF has a long term program of support to the
Jordan Association for Family Planning and Protection.

3     UNFPA recommendations for a podulation strategy
3.1          In 1991, a large UNFPA mission visited lordan to review population policies and to
prepare a five year action plan. Its recommendations, which were fully supported by the World
Bank, aimed at reducing population growth to about 2.8% by the year 2,000 and to reach a
replacement fertility level before 2,030. A set of recomrnendations was developed on a range of
topics, including data collection, demographic training and research, population policy development,
MCH/FP, women in development, information, education and commnunication, and environment
control.
3.2          Most recommendations involved bodies outside the health system, such as the
Directorate of Statistics (data collection), the Universities (training and research), the National
Population Commission (information, education and communication), and several Ministries (Ministry
of Social Development, Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Environment, Ministry of
Industry, Ministry of Education). UNFPA is setting up a comprehensive cooperation program with
these various entities to support policy making and target-setting in the area of population control.
3.3          The UNFPA review also evaluated the MOH, emphasizing on its weak points: the
absence of targets for Family Planning in national health policy, the lack of focal point in the MOH
for family planning activities, insufficient provision of MCH/FP in PHCs, lack of adequate training
for MCH/FP and PHC personnel, lack of a health service statistics system for the MCHIFP program.
Recommendations included: (i) setting goals and indicators for FP programs, (ii) strengthening the
management of MCHIFP at the central level of the MOH and giving due emphasis to MCH/FP in its
organizational structure, (iii) improving the quality of services provided in MCH centers, (iv)

coordinating with the private sector in the delivery of MCH/FP services, (v) implementing a national
training plan for MCH/FP for medical and paramedical personnel already in service, (vi) expanding
the method-mix in MCH/FP programs and (vii) improving the national IEC program.
3.4          UNFPA plans to provide direct support to training (revision of curricula and
introduction of safe motherhood and FP elements in the curricula) with some technical assistance,
support to the MOH (training and technical assistance) in introducing injectables and Norplant in
selected hospitals, expansion of NGO involvement and support to IEC, in coordination with other
donor agencies.
3.5          The present project would implement most of the other recommendations made for the
expansion of MCH/FP activities in the MOH. The new organization of the MOH already provides
for a central Directorate for MCH/FP, and the implementation of a new management information
system would allow such a Directorate to monitor and control the delivery of MCH/FP services.
This new organization would also improve the relationship between MOH and the other health care
providers (other public providers and the private sector). Improvement of services would be achieved
through a major retraining program for primary care personnel (including MCH/FP personnel), both
medical and paramedical, and it is expected that such a program would both increase enrollment into
and decrease drop-out from family planning programs.

ANNEX I I
HEALTH INSURANCE AND COST RBCOVIRY
L     U zlth insurance
At present, four systems of social protection involving health insurance schemes coexist in
Jordan. They are widely different and the populations they cover are of unequal size. Most health
care costs are still financed by Government spending and patients'out-of-pocket expenditures, and the
existing third party schemes are of little importance.
(a)    The Social Security Corporation
The Social Security Corporation (SSC) is financed by premiums paid by those employed in
the formal private sector. Contributions are made both by enterprises (10% of the payroll) and
employees (5% of the payroll), on the basis of salary. The Social Security program finances (i)
retirement pensions (plus temporary and permanent disability indemnities and death indemnities) and
(ii) medical expenses created by work injuries and occupational diseases. Medical care for such
injuries and diseases is mostly dispensed by private sector health care providers, and the SSC already
faces problems associated with controlling costs charged by providers (checking that procedures are
appropriate and have actually been prformed, checking on prices charges, etc.).
There is currently no comprehensive health insurance scheme at the Social Security
Corporation, but a project is under study to create a health insurance system in order to cover hospital
costs of private sector employees, as the charter of the SSC specifies that such a scheme is within the
scope of the corporation. The turnover of such a system has been estimated to amount to 20 million
JD, but this figure is probably not appropriate. A study is under way at the Jordan University' to
determine how the SSC should handle such a scheme. The population covered by such a system
would amount to about 1 million (about 200,000 employees and their dependents), of which at least
20% already have some other form of health insurance coverage.
No actuarial analysis has yet been performed, and cost control requirements for the survival
of such a system have not been determined. Although this project is in its early stages, it has
received a wide support from several administrative and political bodies, as it responds to a widely
shared belief in the desirability of broadening the health component of the social safety net and of
alleviating some of the burden put on the Government budget.
'The Higher Council for Sciences and Technology is also participating in
the feasibility study of a health insurance scheme within the SSC.



- 40 -ANNEX I I
Page 2 of 6
(b)   The Private Health Insurance Systems
Large companies usually provide their employees with some form of health insurance, either
through contracts signed with professional insurance companies, or on an in-house basis (in the form
of a pro-paid package considered as a 'health fund" managed by the company, such as Arab Potash or
the Arab Bank). Health insurance packages usually include strict limitations on yearly expenditures,
dependents coverage and type of provider.
Contracts usually cover the risk of hospitalization and ambulatory care, usually in Jordan
only. Insurance companies are not usually effective in controlling costs generated by the private
providers of care to the enterprises they cover'. In-house health funds", usually do not have
underwriters, although they hire 'medical advisors" who are supposed to check both the actual need
for and amount of medical expenses incurred by their personnel.
(c) Mllitary Health Insurance
This is not an insurance system per se, since payments are not connected to individual risks.
It is an additional source of financing for the Royal Medical Services, for which it provides about
14% of the budget (about 3 million JD per year). Premiums for this system are paid by all military
personnel (1.1% of the basic salary with a ceiling contribution of 1.5 JD per month); the level of
these premiums is lower than that paid by civilian Government employees (see below). This
discrepancy has been a major obstacle to the merger of the two public sector health insurance
schemes.
Contributors to the military health insurance are granted free health care in RMS facilities:
this is not the case for civilians, who have to pay user fees.
(d)    Civilian Health Insurance
This system is also not a health insurance scheme as such, but manages funds earmarked for
the Ministry of Health in addition to direct budgetary funding. Eligible civil servants and their
dependents participate in that fund, and are given a card awarding them free treatment in MOH
hospitals and lower user-fees in MOH prinary care facilities (see below). Many individuals
employed bny the Government are not eligible and therefore not covered, however (such as
contractual agents, for instance). Funds are collected by the Civilian Health Insurance system
(Directorate of Health Insurance of the MOH). Premiums amount to 2% of the basic salary (not
including grants and indemnities), with a ceiling contribution of 8 JD per month.
The Directorate of Health Insurance collects about 5 million JD yearly from premiums, but its
coverage data base is manual and it admits that some premiums might not be collected. Payments
2 Insurance companies have reported that their health insurance schemes
create lossos, and they propose them to their large clients only as part of a

transportation, etc.)



- 41 -                    ANNEX II
Page 3 of 6
made by the Directorate include purchase of drugs and small equipment for MOH facilities,
contributions to the Jordanian association of hemodialysis, payment of fees to private sector facilities
when a public servant is hospitalized (an agreement has to be issued by the Directorate of Health
Insurance before such an hospitalization3), payment of fees to RMS hospitals (when a civil servant is
hospitalized), and payment of an annual fee to Jordan University Hospital (against the right for civil
servants and their dependents to use a certain number of beds at JUH4).
(e)   Multiple coverage and poor management
Although the four above systems are the only ones termed insurance schemes, other schemes
exist: Jordan University provides the equivalent of an insurance scheme to University employees,
students, and their dependents (a yearly fee gives them the right to free treatment in JUH), UNRWA
provides medical services5 to Palestinian refugees at a highly subsidized price, and some private
'preferred provider schemes have been tested by Islamic Hospital and Palestine Hospital.
The above described insurance systems cover citizens according to their workplace, but they
also generally cover their dependents6. Multiple coverage is frequent (civil servants with near
relatives in the army, retired military working as civil servants or in the University, a civil servant
who is also a Palestinian refugee, etc.), and present systems do not make it possible to track them.
The Directorate of Health Insurance cannot even keep a list of recognized dependents of the civil
servants it covers.
As none of the insurance schemes has an efficient way of identifying costs and of controlling their
escalation, they have tended to promote the development of wasteful practices, especially in the
private sector.
3 In case of emergency hospitalization, the Directorate of Health
Insurance requests a MOH hospital doctor to visit the patient and check that
him condition required immediate hospitalization. The procedure is complex,
time and energy consuming, and seems not to be very effective.
4 This agreement is regularly questioned by JUH, which contends that the
amount paid by the Directorate of Health Insurance is too low and does not
cover coutu incurred by JUH.
5 UNRWA services include primary care, specialized care (such as
diabetes control), mother and child health and some hospital care.
6 The definition of a dependent may vary from one system to another.

Charges and Cost Recovery in MOH Facilities
(a)   in primary care facilities
The system is complex, and costs that are recovered do not cover actual expenditures made by
the MOH. A zoning system covers the whole country, and citizens are supposed to attend the
Primary Health Care Center of the zone they belong to. They are given a 'white card", which tells
them what zone they belong to (this system is the basis of definition for PHC catchment areas).
Amounts paid by patients vary according to their compliance with this zoning system.
(i)   Inside the zone
- Patients belonging to the civilian insurance system (civil servants and their dependents)
receive free diagnostic services (visits to a doctor or/and nurse and laboratory tests). They have to
pay for their drugs on the basis of 0.2 JD per 'line" (item) of the prescription. An exception is made
for antipyretics such as acetylsalicylic acid, which cost only 0.05 JD. It should be noted that the
price is the same whatever the quantity prescribed: 100 tablets cost the same as 5 tablets, for
example, as long as they are ordered by the prescribing doctor. Drugs are purchased at the PHC's
pharmacy. If they are not available, the patient may procure them at the private pharmacy of his
choice and the amount is reimbursed by the MOH.
- The poor, i.e. those who hold an indigent card delivered by the Ministry of Social
Development, pay the same amount as "insured" civil servants.
- Among the non-insured, disabled patients (with an appropriate card) and blood donors (with
another appropriate card) are also treated as "insured" civil servants.
- Patients who pay into the Military Insurance system (army personnel and their dependents)
benefit from a very favorable arrangement. Diagnostic services are also free for them, and they pay
only 0.10 JD for the whole prescription they receive, however many items it includes and whatever
the cost of drugs it represents.
- Non insured patients who are neither poor, disabled or blood donors pay 0.30 JD for
diagnostic services, and pay the full cost of drugs. This cost is determined by an official price list
maintained by the MOH.
(ii)   Outside the zone
- If patients belonging to the civilian insurance scheme, and these who receive the same
treatment (the poor, blood donors, the disabled) leave their zone, they are required to pay what the
non insured pay whithin their zone.
- The non insured pay double fees when they leave their zone.



43 -                        ANNEX 1I
Page 5 of 6
- Military personnel and dependents seem to keep their advantages regardless of the facility
the attend for primary care.
(ill) Consequences of this system
a.    Attendance at the PHC centers
Statistics about patient attendance reflect the drawbacks of this system. Military personnel and
their dependents account for about half of the visits to PHC centers (47.1 %), though they represent
only about 30% of the population. Insured civil servants (6.8%) and their dependents (19%) account
for about a fourth of all visits. The poor account for 3.2% of visits, although their proportion of the
population is well over 10%. Finally, 24% of visits are made by paying patients. These probably
represent the less well off share of the non insured, who usually attend the private sector facilities.
As OPD visits in military hospitals are also usually overcrowded (1,000 to 1,200 visits per
day in Irbid military hospital, for instance), it seems that the military population (including
dependents) consumes far more than the average level of medical services. This overuse of medical
care seems at least partly to reflect price distortions.
b.    Efficiency of cost recovery
On average, PHCs collect about 50 to 80 JD per day. Many patients who are able to pay do
not do so but, given the level of fees, the cost of controls would probably be higher than the amounts
that could be recovered from them. Total cost recovery in the primary care system amounts to about
1.6 million JD.
(b)    Cost recovery in MOH hospitals
The zoning system does not apply to hospitals. In principle, patients are not supposed to
enter the hospital system without prior formal referral from a PHC doctor. In practice, self-referrals
are common place (even though PHC doctors sign referral transmission sheets very freely, sometimes
without examining the patient).
Civil servants and their dependents, poor people, dependents of military personnel, disabled
citizens and blood donors are treated free in MOH hospitals. Military personnel and their dependents
are treated free in military hospitals: while MOH hospitals would also accept them, very few attend
MOH hospitals in practice, as quality of care at military hospitals is considered much better.
Other categories of patients pay fees, but charges are nominal: for instance, a delivery costs
12 JD in a MOH hospital (against about 75 JD in a private facility). A visit to a specialized doctor (it
it is not free) costs 1.5 JD in a MOH OPD unit, compared with 6 JD in the University hospital.



- 44-                     ANNEX II
Page 6 of 6
Total fees recovered by MOH hospitals amount to 3.9 million JD (compared with a hospital
recurrent budget of 30.9 million JD in 1992). The fact that hospital fees have not been updated for
the past 20 years contributes to the poor efficiency of the cost recovery system. Furthermore, the
structure of fees does not adquately relate charges to actual costs: for instance, surgical procedures
are broken down into three categories (minor, medium and major surgery), and all operations have to
fit into one of these categories, for each of which a single price is charged7.
The current system is also burdened by 'free-riders' takdng advantage of it. MOH hospitals
have no right to refuse patients who can pay (or to charge them more than the official price). The
combination of overall low fee levels, compounded by free-riders, leads to MOH hospitals sometimes
being too crowded to accomodate 'insured' civil servants. In such a case, the MOH has to pay for
the treatment provided in the private (or Army or University) hospital, to which the individual has
had to be referred. The arrangements regarding tariffs are not clear, a for instance the relationship
between the civilian health insurance and the JUH is based on a contract rather than on a fee-for-
service basis.
Multiple 'health insurance' coverage is very frequent, many patients being entitled to attend
MOH, RMS, or JUH hospitals. Such people have an instutional right to overuse hospital services
with serious consequences for the finances of the hospital system and on the accessibility of the
population as a whole to hospital care.
On the other hand, many people (some of which are employed in Government service) have
no coverage at all and have to pay the full price of health services they receive while living not far
above the poverty line. Such is the case for people employed on a daily or monthly basis by the
Government (such as drivers, janitors) often for a very low salary.
In summary, the basis of a cost recovery system exists in Jordan, but as currendy operated, it
raises relatively little revenue, is complex to administer, and contains substantial inequities.
7 This system has serious consequences for price negotiations with the
private sector; with the latter tending to lnrist that an operation be
upgraded from on- category to a more expensive one, instead of discussing ways
of improving procedures and detailed prices. Under-priced operations are left
to the public sector; alternatively, private hospitals will try to recuperate
their "loss" with additional fees (surgeon visits, anaesthetint, drugs and
equipment)

ANNEX  III
LOCAL TRAINING
This Annex describes the local training activities to be financed under the proposed
project by main project component. The total of local training activities, showing providers, main
elements of curriculum, duration of training, number of trainees and phasing by project years, is
summarized in the table at the end of this Annex.
1.     Improve the quality of primary health care (PHC), mother and child health/ramily
planning (MCHIFP) and the management of hospital services
A major retraining program for medical and paramedical staff will be financed through the
project. This training would be developed in two phases: Phase I (six months) would comprise
curriculum development, mobilization of trainers, and selection of priority criteria for the selection of
trainees; Phase 2 would consist in re-training PHC GPs, nurses, midwives, and medical secretaries.
*       ZDuring phase 2, about 120 medical doctors would be retrained on a part-time basis over a six-
month period in each project year, for a total of 540 trainees over the project's lifetime. The main
training topics would include family planning (with an emphasis on information, education and
communication, and outreach approaches), mother and child health, family health, community health,
epidemiology, health center administration and accounting; the Ministry of Health has developed
training expertise in some health centers (such as El-Hashemi CHC in Amman), and the training of
GPs will take place in these centers, which will receive additional training equipment through the
project (see Annex VI).
-       Nurses and midwives working in Drimary care facilities would also benefit from additional
training, which would be provided by the Institute for Specialized Nursing Studies, which has
developed a special training program in primary-care for paramedical personnel". This training
includes a major family planning component. During Phase 2, the Institute would train up to 80
paramedical staff annually, or about 400 for the duration of the project;
S       Specialized training in medical records systems would be created by the MOH in the Amman
School of Nursing; it would be linked to the training program for medical secretaries.
Specialized training for medical secretaries would be developed at one of the country's
nursing schools. This training would be open to MOH secretaries (one year) or "practical nurses"
This Institute has been cmeted on the site of AIBashir Hospital in Ammon, with the usistac of a USAID progam.
which has just been renewed for 2 more yean. The curiculum is highly saisfactory, but several of the nures
trmined in the Institute have been hired in hospitals instead of being used in PHCr. MOH is now corrunitted to
developing incentives to rtin such tmined personnel at the primay cam level.

(two years). A curriculum has been developed and logistics for training would be organized by
project implementation. This specialized training is expected to train 25 medical secretaries per year
(i.e. about 125 for the duration of the project).
A special management training program for Salt hospital administration Dersonnel will be
implemented. This training will be provided on the site of Salt hospital by a foreign consultant
during the first three years of the project for a total of 70 man-months. Further practical training in
hospital management for hospital administrators would also take place in Salt hospital, while
theoretical training would remain at Jordan University.
2.     Improve the availibility and efrectiveness or hospital services
*       Jordan University would develop a special course in auxiology (medical and surgical
emergencies) for emergency room medical doctors, with the assistance of the Royal Medical Services
(RMS). This six month course would train six doctors every year during years 2-4 of the project.
Practical training would take place in MOH and RMS hospitals
Medical maintenance engineers and technicians would receive two months training courses at
the Amman maintenance training facility" (about 60 man-months for maintenance centers and 120
man-months for hospital workshops over the lifetime of the project). Seminars on maintenance
organization would be organized in the second and the fourth years of the project.
Initial training of technicians and medical personnel in charge of handling the medical
equipment to be procured through the project would be included in the equipment package, and would
be the responsibility of equipment suppliers.
3.     Improve cost recovery and health frn9ncing
Training in Health Insurance will be provided for staff of the Dirctorate of Health [nsurance.
Local training would be provided by Jordan University, through programs in health management and
economics.
*       Training in the use of computer equipment supplied through the project would be undertaken
by suppliers.
This technical school hs been remzod with the usistuace of MrZ. und taim medical rnintawce technicias. for
both the mdituy and civilian health systems. The level of training is adequaz. and this school has agreed to orgairze
refrsher cours for medical maintenance techniciua under the project.

ANNEX VI
EOUIPMENT
This Annex describes the medical and office equipment to be financed under the
proposed project by main project component.
1.    Improve the Ouality of primara of health care (PHCI. mother and child health/family
planning (MCH/EP) and the management of hospital services
*      The project would provide training equipment for health centers selected as training sites and
materials (books, slides, etc.) for programs targeted towards doctors and paramedical personnel;
*      Computers, typewriters, and educational equipment would be financed for the organization of
specialized programs (medical records technicians, medical secretaries);
The project would finance manuals and periodicals for PHC, MCH/FP and public health at
each of the newly created directorates for primary care in the new Regional Health Authorities;
3      A management information system would be developed in Salt hospital during the six first
months of the project, and the project would finance associated computers, software, and office
equipment.
e       bThe project would also finance computers and printers in 2 PHCs and 1 CHC in the Salt area
(primary care facilities attached to Salt hospital as a referral center).
2.    Improve the Availability and Effectiveness of Hospital Services
*     The project would finance the construction and rehabilitation of Princess Basma hospital,
rehabilitation of emergency units in five hospitals, and construction of maintenance workshops in 12
hospitals, three regional maintenance centers and medical warehouses. It would also finance imported
equipment for these facilities, as follows: (i) in Princess Basma Hospital, equipment would include
radiology, laboratory, obstetrics, emergency and operating room equipment; (ii) in the five new
emergency departments, equipment and first aid medical equipment would be supplied, together with
advanced communication equipment (radio-transmitters); (iii) general maintenance equipment and
workshop tools would be supplied in the 12 hospital workshops, together with information support
technology, while regional maintenance centers would receive equipment for the maintenance of
electrical, electronic and mechanical medical equipment.

Page 2 of 2
3.    Improve the Managerial and Planning Capabilities of the MOH
*     The decentralization process would require better communications within each region, among
regions, and between regions and the central level. The project would finance the purchase of fax
machines and other communication tools during the two first years of implementation.
*     Once a management information system has been designed, computers and software would be
financed by the project at the central and regional levels.
4.     Improve Cost Recovery and Health Financing
*      The project would finance computers and software for the Directorate of Health Insurance,
so as to permit the development of a data base of civil servants and their dependents (in order to trace
and elimenate multiple coverage), accounting of premiums and expenditure, and statistical data
analysis, actuarial analysis and mathematical modeling.
5.    Improve the long term planning of the health system to meet the needs of the population
*      the project would finance micro-computers and software, printing equipment, and periodicals
for the epidemiological study. The computers would be used for survey analysis, and at a later stage
for the determination of health priorities.
the project would also finance micro-computers and software (covering financial analysis,
actuarial analysis, data-base management) for the health insurance study.

ANNEX VII
HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT COMPONENT
SALT PILOT SITE
1.           In order to improve management effectiveness and service provision at MOH hospitals,
the project will support MOH's new decentralized hospital management policy.
2.           Salt hospital has been selected as the pilot site for the development and implementation
of the new policy. A new organizational structure will be established; on-site training programs in office
management, human resources, medical records, budgeting and planning will be created; and a complete
management information system will be developed and implemented.
3.           The pilot program will take place during the three first years of the project. After
evaluation of the results at the pilot site, the new management system will be extended to all MOH
hospitals. Salt hospital will also be used as a training facility for the Jordan University Health
Management Program, as this program is currently geared toward theoretical aspects of hospital
management and lacks practical training. This program will be strengthened by including part time
faculty with substantial hospital experience and a substantial amount of student internship as part of the
degree requirement.
Salt pilot experiment
Present situation
4.           The current management structure of Salt hospital consists of one Hospital Director
supported by two assistants: a technical manager and an administrative manager. There is little
devolution of responsibility or delegation in the decision making process. The director and his assistants
are physicians, and the director also holds a degree in hospital management administration. The technical
manager is responsible for all the non-patient care departments.  The administrative manager is
responsible for the follow-up of accounts, personnel and administrative relations with the Directorate of
Hospitals. Most of patient care services are directly under the responsibility of the Director.
5.           Current management systems are weak and do not use computers. Arrangements for drug
dispensing, cash collection and the manual tabulation of dispensed medications are time consuming,
ineficcient and sometimes inaccurate. The present systems do not provide statistical reporting and
analysis, which the input of some computerized systems would provide. In addition, such technology
would also provide a data base for analyses of key aspects of the hospital operations, such as bed
occupancy by service, length of stay by service and by type of patient, readmission rates, operating room
activities, etc.



- 63 -                      Annex VII
Page 2 of 12
6.           The financial function is rudimentary, consisting of manual billing and collection, with
no effective budgeting function. The human resources function consists of a personnel department, which
has no responsibility for hiring, firing, promoting, training, transferring or disciplining staff. All such
functions are currently handled at the central level of the MOH Directorate of Hospitals. In such a
management vacuum, employees do not have a clear picture of their responsiblities, how their
performance is measured and evaluated, or what career path may exist for them.
7.           No official or unit is currently designated to handle patient and community relation
problems. Fifteen percent of the expected revenue from cost recovery remains uncollected but there
exists no efficient system of legal aid to support hospital management taking legal action to recover
unpaid charges and fees when and where appropriate. Further, since fees collected by the hospital are
not retained for local use, there is little incentive for local collection of unpaid bills.
8.           In-house medical committees exist for some important clinical practice areas, but there
is no centralized group in the form of a Medical Staff Council or Hospital Medical Committee to plan,
oversee and monitor medical performance and doctors' issues. There is no supervision of the quality of
care provided by medical and paramedical staff; peer reviewing, permanent training and best practice
dissemination are not handled formally.
9.           The current management process lacks a structure for effective decision taking. It relies
heavily on an informal networks, top-down decision taking and crisis management. There is a dearth of
accurate and timely information on patient visits, types and volumes of procedures, and there is no
planning process: no maintenance plan has been made, inflated annual requests for equipment are sent
to the Directorate of Hospitals regardless of priority needs (most are turned down, and often the equiment
items which are delivered do not correspond to actual critical needs), there is no hospital master-plan,
and in the absence of a budget, financial planning is non-existent.
10.          The management of day to day operations needs to be strengthened. This mnst be
complemented by a sound strategic and operational planning function. Planning is at present centralized
at the Ministry level in the Directorate of Planning and the Directorate of Hospitals, and does not deal
appropriately with local situations.
Proposed Organization
1l.          The proposed organization (as in Fig. 1) increases the span of control from two to five
commands below director level. Greater responsibility is therefore delegated to a wider group of
managers at all levels and functions are grouped in a more coherent manner. This also provides a
structure to facilitate improved communication within and outside, the main departments. The five main
functional groupings are: Out-patient Services; In-patient Services; Technical Services; Support Services;
and Financial Affairs.
12.          Some additional explicit functions such as Human Resources, Budgeting, Medical Staff
Affairs, Material Management, Patient and Community relations, and Research and Planning are
recommended to strengthen further the existing hospital management system further. These functions
would be allocated among the five managers (see Fig. 1).

Page 3 of 12
Proposed Education and Training Program
13.          Starting at the beginning of the second year of the project, Salt hospital managerial staff
will have access to scholarship to learn hospital administration and management overseas. During the
first year, an evaluation of training requirements will be done with the help of the foreign technical
assistance, and training sites will be selected.
14.          Health Management Systems at the hospital level will require skill development in office
management, budgeting and planning, personnel management, and the development of semi-computerized
departmental systems. The office management component would include organizing skills, time
management principles, and work area management skills. These skills would strengthen day to day
management practices at all levels. Budgeting and planning skills development would complement
operational and strategic capabilities. The terms of reference for the foreign consultants, who would
provide training in these areas, are provided at the end of the Annex.
Implementation issues and considerations
15.          The implementation of the proposed training and education program, installation of the
computerized management systems, evaluation of the Salt experiment and replication of the Salt
experience to other MOH hospitals calls for specific but different roles to be played by the technical
assistance personnel assigned to this component (see Annex V): a resident management systems consultant
and other foreign technical specialists and the Salt hospital director. It calls for development of an
implementation strategy that utilizes coordinated actions by these key individuals (terms of reference are
attached at the end of this Annex). This strategy will be developed in the early stages of the pilot
program, and cornmunicated to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).
16.          The liaison officer of the PIU (see para 4.26 of the main report) will act as coordinator
with the personnel and foreign specialists at Salt hospital. He will help the hospital director in his role
as the principal change agent during the implementation and replication of Salt management systems to
other MOH hospitals. The resident management system consultant, in addition to being an advisor to
the Salt director, would oversee completion of consultancy services for management information systems
and management techniques He will develop and monitor indicators of management efficacy for the
hospital and will also develop training program and schedules for replication of the Salt pilot experience
in other MOH hospitals.
Improving the referral system in Salt area
17.          At present, PHC activities are under the responsibility of the health directorates of the
Governorate, which means that VHCs, PHCs and CHCs centers are under the control of the local
directors of health, while the Hospital Director is presently under the control of the Directorate of
Hospitals in MOH headquarters.
18.          In 1990, the estimated population for Balqa governorate was 235,000, of which the town
of Salt and 'suburbs" comprised 162,850 inhabitants. This urban population remains the main catchment
area for Salt hospital (160 beds).



- 65 -                      Annex VII
Page 4 of 12
19.          For reasons not directly related to health management, Balqa govemorate was fragmented
into three health regions:
- Balqa Directorate: this directorate is in charge of Salt, Arda district, and Zavy district. This health
directorate is the most important as its estimated population amounts to nearly 200.000 inhabitants. Salt
hospital is the only public hospital to serve this area, but it includes a number of primary care centers.
- South-Shuneh Directorate: the population was estimated at 28.000 inhabitants in 1992; there is one small
24 bed hospital in this district, along with 4 PHCs and 5 VHCs.
- Der Alla Directorate: it has a population of 33.000; health facilities are represented by 1 Comprehensive
Health Center (CHC), 4 Primary Health Care centers (PHC) and 4 Village Health Centers (VHC).
20.          Proposals have been put by the Balqa Health Director and the Director of Salt Hospital
in order to improve the primary car.-hospital referral system. These proposals would be developed
during the pilot program and would lead to recommendations to the MOH as regards the organization of
the referral system under the new administrative organization.
21.          Rules and regulations to be established. Except for emergency cases, patients should
first pass though the filter of the existing primary care referral system (VHCs, PHCs, CHCs) before
being referred if needed to the hospital. Patients who still bypass this referral system and go directly to
the hospital OPD would have to pay an additional charge. A list of criteria for patient admission would
be established for each type of health facility.
22.          Detailed file for each patient. A detailed file would be established for each patient and
maintained by respective health facilities. The name of the GP in charge of the patient would be given
together with any condition or long term treatment, if appropriate; in case of referral, the name of the
specialist and the treatmnent prescribed would appear on the file. After discharge from the hospital, the
patient would be referred back with his hospital file to the GP who in charge of his casc. This file would
be considered as a "referral form' and would be developed during the pilot program. Foreign consultants
providing technical assistance to Salt hospital would liaise with the staff in charge of training for medical
records technicians for the development of such forms.
23.          Motivation of medical and paramedical staff. There is a need to develop responsibility
and accountability of staff at all the levels of the referral system. In spite of the "zoning system" (Annex
II) which provides financial incentives to patients who refer to the primary care facility closest to their
home, it is important to increase the motivation of personnel in order Lo make them keen to attract
patients to their center. An incentive plan to improve the motivation of medical and paramedical staff
would be developed during the pilot program.
Guidelines for Evaluating the Salt pilot experiment
24.          The terms of reference of the resident management system consultant call for developing
job descriptions for all job categories/titles at the Salt Hospital. He would not only ensure that this task
has been completed for all employees but also that these job descriptions provide clear, concise and
reasonable descriptions of each employee's duties. This can be accomplished through reviewing all job
descriptions for all job categories, surveying personnel for their perception of work envirenment,
receiving feedback from hospital managers and supervisors, and distributing and evaluating a
questionnaire for patients.



- 66 -                      Annex VII
Page 5 of 12
25.          The evaluation of the Salt pilot experiment will be based on a group of variables which
will be combined into an averall aggregate measure of effectiveness. The final aggregate measure will
draw on both indicators of the performance of the hospital as a health facility, and the completion and
quality status of the following five components of the pilot program: 1) implementation of a new
organization structure, 2) development of personnel management skills, 3) development of planning
capacity, 4) development of operations management skills at the administrative level, 5) development and
successful implementation of computer systems.
26.          For each component or sub-component, a measurement instrument such as a survey or
a questionnaire would be developed and completed with support of the technical assistance program
before the end of the second year of the project, comprising appropriate directly measurable indicators,
showing the degree and quality of completion. If possible, the instrument should also measure how
effectively the Salt employees have learnt relevant sets of skills.
27.          Indicators of hospital performance would include bed occupancy, average length of stay,
readmission rate, mortality rate, post-operative infection rate, etc. and would include an evaluation of
medical efficiency (development of peer reviewing and medical audit procedures are part of the pilot
program), which would be determined by the medical staff.
28.          Based on the evaluation, a final judgement on the Salt experiment's success would then
be made and communicated to the Project Implementation Unit. The broad criterion for success would
include both a high completion rate for each evaluation component and also a high level of satisfaction
with the education and training program. The hospital director and the resident management system
expert will produce a report for the PIU at the end of the experiment period. This report will be
submitted to the Bank and to the Minister of Health for review.
Replication of the Salt pilot management system experiment to other MOH Hospitals:
29.          After completion of the Salt pilot experiment and outcome of its evaluation, a
recommendation would be made by the PIU to the Minister of Health on replicability of the system to
other MOH hospitals. If the results of the Salt pilot management systems evaluation are positive and
without any major problems, a similar implementation program can be developed for replication. The
project includes provision for financing additional training for hospital managers in other facilities to
prepare them for a successful replication of the system developed in Salt. In order to accommodate
differences between different hospitals, the program contents should be individually tailored. For
replication, the Salt hospital will be used as a training site for hospital management staff.
30.          The education and training program for replication and the training schedule will be
developed by the resident management system consultant to reflect the Salt hospital experience. The
program should be modular so that it can be concurrently used at more than one place at a time.
Requirements for the organization of training sessions in Salt hospital for managers from other facilities
will be determined by the consultant by the end of the second year of the project.
31.          For example, as part of replication, job descriptions for all job categories have to be
completed. The manager in charge of human resources in Salt hospital would be a resource person for
replication and training in this area. During the pilot program, foreign consultants will determine how



- 67 -                      Annex VII
Page 6 of 12
this individual would develop a plan to ensure replication of job descriptions for all MOH hospitals and
develop training programs that would upgrade the employee management systems skills of supervisors
and managers. Proposals will be made to link practical experience gained in Salt hospital with the
program in hospital management taught in Jordan University.
32.          The development and implementation of the computerized management systems would
be undertaken under the guidance of the foreign management information systems specialist, who would
develop a training schedule and a work plan that would ensure implementation of similar departmental
systems at other MOH hospitals. A task force should be formed at a national level to oversee replication
of such systems for each hospital, so that organization, management and outputs of management
information systems in Jordan public sector hospitals remain coherent and comparable. This task force
should include MOH hospital directors, data processing managers and MOH executive, at the central and
regional levels, and should be given the authority to establish norms regarding hospital mangement
information systems.

World Bank Health Management Project will help the Government improve the quality of health care and
the productivity of public sector health care delivery while rationalizing and containing sector
expenditures. This project will support MOH reorganization, increase hospital service availability and
efficiency, improve the level of cost recovery, finance long-term studies, and improve the quality of
primary and hospital care. Under this last component, a decentralized hospital management system is
to be established. The Salt hospital has been designated as the pilot site for a 'showcase installation' of
a new management system later to be duplicated throughout the MOH hospitals.
Under the proposed pilot scheme, the Salt hospital management structure would be
reorganized and management systems would be upgraded from a manual system to a partly computerized
system for admissions, billing, patient accounting, x-ray, lab, pharmacy, and a medical records
department.
The Consultant's tasks:
During the first two years, the management system consultant would be in a "resident"
position in Salt hospital, as a direct adviser to the Director, and he would assist in the development of
the new hospital management system. During the third year, he will help with the evaluation and the fine
tuning of the pilot program and propose measures to prepare the replication of the system to all the MOH
hospitals. During the last year, he will oversee the implementation of the new system in all MOH
hospitals. Details terms of reference are given only for the first two years, as the subsequent content of
the assignment would be greatly influenced by the results of the pilot program. Detailed terms of
reference for the third and fourth year would be proposed by the resident management system consultant
to the Project Implementation Unit, and be submitted to the Bank and the Minister of Health for approval.

Page 8 of 12
The tasks for the first two years would include:
1.           Prepare job descriptions for all positions in consultation with functional managers within
the hospital. This should also include review, and appropriate revision of the recently prepared job
descriptions of the top management posts in the hospital, already completed as an initial exercise. This
component is expected to be finalized during the first six months of the program.
2.           Design programs and provide training in office management skills development; employee
management skills development and communication skills. The office management skills component
would include organizing skills, time management skills and work area management skills. The employee
management skills component would include employee performance measurement, motivational skills and
employee discipline skills. This component should be developed as modular workshops to train
employees at the administration department of the hospital. These modules would later be used in other
MOH hospitals. This component is expected to take about one year.
3.           Provide in-house development and training on Budgeting for all functional managers,
enabling them to carry out this process for the ensuing year on their own. The budgeting component
must include the fixed and variable portions where patient volume or tests or both affect work load. It
should also include budgeting for capital equipment, office supplies and any continuing education needs.
During the training, emphasis should be on the process as opposed to the final budget. It should also
include a short seminar on planning so that managers can appreciate the use of budgeting as a planning
tool. This component is expected to take one year. During the second year, the resident management
system consultant would help develop utilization of the budget and development of financial analysis in
the hospital.
4.           Develop and implement hospital relations (including patient relations and community
relations) program to address the crucial need for improving contacts between care providers and patients
and for developing community relations to enable the hospital to meet the community's health care needs.
Train a person to assume responsibility for this function within the hospital. This component is expected
to take six man-months and to involve the design of communication tools with local authorities and
representatives of the population.
5.           In consultation with managers, develop and implement productivity and quality statistics
to provide hospital management with information vital to operations management. An example for
pharmacy might include: statistics on the number of prescriptions filled; number of lines filled; number
of lines not filled; waiting time for patients during prescription filling etc. This component should take
about one year and a half, with concertation seminars organized every four to six months.
6.           Conduct workflow improvement analysis in all direct and indirect patient care areas using
a Flow process chart to enable improved care delivery. Using 80/20 rule, select only those activities that
are predominant in patient care. This component should take place during the first year, so that
improvements in productivity can be measured at the earliest possible stage.
7.           Provide training in medical records transcription to enable technicians to code correctly
discharge diagnosis, and provide future capability for standardized hospital stay summary reports.

8.           The consultant should have a graduate degree in Hospital Management systems with at
least ten years experience in the design and application of management systems in the health sector,
including several years as a Hospital Director for a general hospital.
9.           The consultant would work closely with the Salt hospital Director during the first two
years pf the poject, and with the head of the Project Implementation Unit in the MOH during project
years 3 and 4. During the term of his assignment at Salt hospital, he will be in the position of advisor
to the Hospital Director. He should be fluent in English and/or Arabic. The total duration of the
assignment is 48 months.

JORDAN
HEALTH NANAGEXZNT PROJECT
PRINCESS BASNA HOSPITAL CONPONENT
SELECTION OF ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES
1.    Selection of Consultants for the Princess Basma Hospital. The appraisal mission for the
proposed project reached agreement with the MOH and the responsible section in the Ministry of Public
Works (MPW) on the principles and modalities of the selection of consultants under the above project
component. It has been agreed that the selection of consultants would be restricted to an open invitation
from the pool of MPW's highest grade pre-qualified consultants, which currently is limited to nine well
qualified firms. It was also agreed, that the selection would be done in accordance with the principles
that are elaborated in the appended Letter of Invitation and Terms of Reference (which were prepared
during the appraisal mission and have been discussed with MOH and MPW), stressing the need for
coordination of all aspects of the consultancy over time, and high levels of technical excellence in all
fields related to the design, organization and coordination of hospital construction with hospital equipment
selection, installation and maintenance. In summary this means that:
o     A single consultancy consortium would be responsible for all aspects of the task, both in
terms of technical knowledge across all the required specializations, and also over time
by choosing the same consortium for the duration of the task from the preparation of
schematic designs through tendering, supervision of contractors, and until handover
inspections of completed buildings, equipment and maintenance systems;
o     The consultants would only be selected from firms that can demonstrate competency and
coordination abilities in all the required consultancy fields by organizing an appropriate
comprehensive consultancy consortium for the purpose of the project;
o     The technically best qualified consortium of firms with the best technical proposals and
staffing deployment would be put at the best advantage in the selection process by
ensuring that it would be awarded a high technical score, and that any technically weak
proposal would be rejected;
o     The weight of the technical scores (75%) would far outweigh the weight of the financial
scores (25%), and that the integrity of the technical evaluation would be maintained by
carrying out the technical and the financial evaluations strictly independent of each other.
2.    The appended detailed Instructions to Bidders and Terms of Reference give the necessary further
information.

ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES
Instructions to Bidders
1.   These Instructions to Bidders invite all consultants in Jordan who have been pre-qualified and
classified in the highest competency grade to submit a technical proposal for architectural and engineering
(including medical engineering) design and supervision services that the MOH will require in the near
future. The Terms of Reference for these services are spelled out in an attachment to this invitation.
The other eight Jordanian firms in this category have also been invited to submit their technical proposals
for these services.
2.    It is the intent of the Government to have these proposals evaluated by a panel of technical experts
solely on their technical merits before evaluating the financial proposals for these services, which will
remain undisclosed until completion of the technical proposals. The final evaluation and selection of the
winning bid will be done in accordance with a composite formula covering the relative merits of the
technical and financial proposals as further explained in para S. below. It is the intent of the Government
to award the entire consultancy assignment as one contract to a consortium of consultants, who can
provide the design, tendering and supervision phases of the whole project, including all its architectural,
building engineering, medical engineering, training and maintenance aspects. For accounting and
evaluation purposes, you are nevertheless requested to submit itemized prices for each phase of the
consultancy assignment, including separate estimates of fees and reimbursable expenditures for each
phase. Your submitted financial proposal must be stated in current prices: any price escalation clauses
under the contract will be subject to negotiations with the winning bidder.
3.     If your proposal is successful, you will be expected to sign a contract with the Government,
using the World Bank's Sample Form of Contract for CONSULTANT'S SERVICES (March 1989)
as the base contract.
4.    Please note that any manufacturing or construction firm with which you may be associated will
not be eligible to participate in any project resulting from or associated with the consulting assignment.
5. Background. The Government of Jordan is applying for a loan from the World Bank, equivalent
to about US$20 million towards improving the public health sector in Jordan through a number of
interventions to be implemented by the Ministry of Health (MOH). A portion of the loan amount will
be used for the construction of new hospital facilities and improvement to existing facilities, including
the necessary architectural and engineering services, at the Princess Basma Hospital in Irbid. As
explained in more detail in the attached TORs, the Princess Basma Hospital is a general purpose hospital,



- 77 -                      ANNEX VIII
Page 3 of 10
which currently contains 282 beds in overcrowded and unsanitary facilities. The project proposes to: (a)
reconstruct these facilities in new structures (as a modem general hospital) on the existing hospital site;
and (b) convert and refurbish the existing facilities into fully functional hospital facilities, including a
maternity ward of about 80 beds.
6.    In order to help the panel of technical experts conduct their evaluation, you are requested to
submit the information required to evaluate the items in para 7. The numbers in brackets at the end of
each sub-paragraph (totalling 100) indicate the weight that will be given to that particular item in the
technical evaluation.
7.    Technical Evaluation.
I. General Experience In the Field of the Assignment (35S
(a)    The number of years that your firm has been in operation in the field of architectural and
engineering design and supervision, and a list of major assignments that your firm has
undertaken over the past five years, and the nature of these assignments (5).
(b)    Fields of technical expertise offered in-house by your firm (including the availability of
CAD), and lists of associated firms (including their qualifications) that you would
propose to engage if your firm lacks in-house expertise to undertake some of the required
consultancy tasks (5).
(c)    Your firm's experience with hospital designs and supervision in Jordan and abroad,
including in particular experience with coordination of hospital construction with the
installation of medical equipment (25).
II. Adequacy of the Progosed Work Plan in Responding to the TORs (25):
This evaluates the merits of your proposal in responding to the TORs, especially the items
discussed in its para 5(a) - A Comprehensive Work Plan. This would be judged from three
aspects:
(d)    Adequacy of Plans aimed at Minimizing Operational Disruptions for the Hospital During
Project Implementation (5).
(e)    Adequacy of Plans to Improve Economy and Efficiency of Project Designs, Equipment
Selection, Tendering and Supervision for the various inputs into the Project (10).
(f)    Coordination Plans among the Various Technical Disciplines, both at the Design Stage
and at the Supervision Stage (10).

(h)    Competence of other Key Staff (20).
8.    The scores of the technical evaluation will not be tallied until the financial proposals have been
invited. At the time of opening the financial proposals, the technical scores for each proposal, awarded
by the technical evaluation panel will be averaged. Proposals scoring less than 60% will be rejected as
being non-responsive. The remaining proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the formula: Tn x
75% + Fn x 25%. In this formula, Tn is the average technical score for each firm. Tn is computed
as follows for each firm:
The technical score of firm n
Tn = -                          x 100
The highest subitted technical score
Frn is computed as follows for each firm:
The lowest submitted responsive bid
Fn =    -                     x 100
The financial submission of firm n
The contract will be awarded to the firm receiving the highest score under the above formula.
9.    You (and your competitors) are invited to submit your proposal in a sealed envelope to:
Include a clear name and address (ocation) here.

ARCHEMCTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.    Background. The Government of Jordan is applying for a loan from the World Bank equivalent
to about US$20 million towards improving the public health sector in Jordan through a number of
interventions to be implemented by the Ministry of Health (MOH). A portion of the loan amount will
be used for the construction of new hospital facilities and improvement to existing facilities, including
the necessary architectural and engineering services, at the Princess Basma Hospital in Irbid. The
purpose of these terms of reference (TORs) is to define the architectural and engineering (including
medical engineering) services that the MOH will require from the firm or consortium of firms that will

of the consultants and contractors during the construction, including the staffing
requirements therefore, both during the design phase and at the supervision stage. This
narrative would be complemented by a bar, or GANTT chart, showing the timing and
relationships between and among the various tasks. This work plan (to be periodically
updated during project implementation by the successful consultancy consortium) would
be an elaboration of the initially agreed work plan, that is being submitted by the
consultants as a part of its original bid for the consultancy assignment.
(b)    Building Designs and Coordination of Buildings and Equipment. This would entail

OUII   MANAGMNeNT AND MAINTENANCE
Presentation
1.           Maintenance and equipment management activities provide the basis of effective
planning for medical technology, procurement, storage and distribution of equipment. At present, the
Ministry of Health subcontracts maintenance activities (both preventive and curative) to the Royal
Scientific Society (RSS) for most MOH hospital equipment. As a result, and despite the high quality
of RSS services, equipment items are often immobilized for long periods and their availability is low.
Moreover, MOH is highly dependent on the RSS and is not able to build its own technical expertise
or to develop effective planning for the procurement of new equipment. Finally, MOH has no direct
control over the costs of maintenance and cannot use them as a basis for technical specifications of
new equipment, and maintenance resources are not directly available to end-users, which prevents
them from establishing priorities in the allocation of resources. The project will help the MOH
develop its own expertise in terms of equipment management and maintenance through staff training
and institutional reorganization.
Pro2osed organization
2.           The new organization of the Ministry of Health will gather all the equipment-related
tasks that are scattered in different directorates under the authority of the Assistant Secretary General
for services and supplies. This organization will be functional at the national level and operational at
the regional (Regional Directorate of supplies and maintenance) and local levels.
3.           The functional level will be under the direct authority of the Assistant Secretary
General in charge of services and supply. Its main tasks will be to:
o     Design medical equipment plans with the Assistant Secretary General for planning;
o     Define typical equipment lists to be used as guidelines for planning;
o     Organize hospital technology assessments;
o     Coordinate hospital equipment needs and allocation;
o     Define specifications for equipment procurement and tender evaluation;
o     Evaluate recurrent costs related to new technologies;
o     Follow up international standards and establish national guidelines for equipment
installation, safety procedures and protection of the environment;
o     Reallocate equipment according to documented needs;
o     Decide on the elimination of used or obsolete equipment;
o     Supervise, coordinate and set objectives for the two Regional Maintenance Centers;
o     Design a maintenance strategy and an inventory policy using a standard nomenclature;
o     Follow-up national maintenance contracts with RSS and suppliers;
o     Define preventive maintenance plans with regional centers;



- 86 -                            Annex IX
Page 2 of 2
o     Establish a national database for equipment and maintenance;
o     Follow-up international standards for maintenance;
o     Assess technical personnel qualifications and quantitative needs, and liaise with
training facilities for engineers and technicians.
4.           The regional operational level will consist of two Regional Maintenance Centers: one
in Irbid for the Northern Region and one in Yajouz (near Zarqa) for the South and the Midlands.
Each center will be responsible for mobile and fixed equipment, and maintenance of buildings. A
method and programming office will supervise the technicians. Fellowships, training and technical
assistance for these centers are described in Annexes Im, IV and V. The Regional Centers will:
o     Draft proposals for the purchase of equipment and spare parts.
o     Propose equipment reallocation.
O     Propose the elimination used or obsolete equipment.
O     Manage a regional equipment inventory.
O     Perform second level maintenance in hospital and health centers.
O     Train hospital technicians.
O     Train end users.
O     Supervise maintenance contracts with suppliers.
O     Commission new equipment.
O     Manage spare equipment pool.
O     Maintain as-built drawings of facilities.
O     Maintain equipment documentation and manuals.
5.           The local operational level will consist of hospital workshops with small stores for
spare parts (mainly for routine spare parts). These workrhops will be used by hospital technician(s)
for actions they are competent to perform, and by regional maintenance teams when they visit the
site. Workshops will be built or rehabilitated in twelve hospitals (Zarqa, Mafraq, Jerash, Ajlun, Al
Ramtha, Abu Obeida, Mu-ath, Salt, Madaba, Kerak, Ghour Safi and Ma'an). An additional
workshop is planned as part of the rehabilitation of Princess Basma Hospital. These workshops will
be staffed with graduates from the Maintenance Equipment Training Center. They will:
o     Establish local maintenance statistics
o     Manage local equipment inventory
o     Perform simple preventive maintenance based on preventive maintenance plans.
o     Provide maintenance and technical information to users.
O     Perform first line curative maintenance.

ANNEX X
Reoraanization of the Ministry of Health
I - Principles of the reorganization
1.            As a basis for restructuring MOH organization and management, the Minister of
Health has established a set of principles for future carrying out the Ministry's functions as follows:
(i) there should exist a clear relationship between the Ministry structure and the services actually
delivered to patients and clients, (ii) the Ministry should have an organizational structure which
ensures that individuals can best work together to achieve the required outputs, (iii) the structure
should be developed in the light of a full understanding of the nature of the required outputs, (iv)
there should be substantial devolution of decision taking, and spans of control, both at the central and
regional levels of the management structure, and (v) there should be maximum delegation of
responsibility downwards and minimum referral of decisions upwards.
2.            Preliminary studies performed by the Reform Action Group created by the Ministry of
Health in 1991 have identified the main functional responsibilities of the Ministry as follows:
a.     Policy Dlanning and finance: development of a strategic framework for safeguarding and
improving the health of the Kingdom and of specific policies and plans to promote this goal
over time within the resources likely to be available; resource allocation, cost recovery,
financial accountability and coordination of financial inputs from other agencies designed to
improve the health of the nation;
b.     Personnel: a broad function ranging from policies for the recruitment and development of
manpower in all health-related disciplines through manpower planning and development to
continuing education and training;
c.     Procurement: the development and control of national policies for the assessment of need,
specification of requirements, purchasing, installation, maintenance and upkeep, disposal and
replacement of all major equipment, supplies and services;
d.     Technical regulations: setting of standards for all technical matters relating to health care and
protection of the health of the population, development of national policies and control
mechanisms for statutory regulation and control which cannot be decentralized;
e.     Ouality control: audit function of health sector performance as a whole, inspection of
facilities, control of administrative and financial performance of health administrations,
follow-up on enforcement of rules and regulations, oversight at the national level of the
decentralized management and provision of services to clients at MOH hospitals, primary care
centers and clinics.



- 88 -
Annex X
Page 2 of 8
3.           The underlying principle of the reorganization is that headquarters of the Ministry of
Health should concentrate on the above functions, adopt an organizational structure to best execute
them and devolve the day-to-day management and delivery of health care and public health services to
the new Regional Health Authorities. The Ministry would still, however, be responsible for
definition of an operational policy for the regions and a strategic framework for accountability, setting
objectives and reviewing performance at the regional level, and allocating resources to the regions.
II - Main features of the Central Level of MOH
4.            As at present, the Secretary General would be in charge of managing the Ministry and
would report directly to the Minister of Health. The Secretary General would now be supported,
however, by five new Assistant Secretaries General, each of whom would control a series of
functional Directorates (at present, 26 different Directorates report directly to the Secretary General).
The Secretary General would personally control the legal affairs bureau and the public relations of the
Ministry, and would be assisted by two small central groups: an Executive Board, and a Professional
and Management Development Unit. The Executive Board would consist of advisers to the Secretary
General and be in charge of preparing policy decisions, appointments, work programs, etc. The
Board would be in charge of organizing meetings with ASGs at the national and regional levels and of
keeping records of decisions made at the Secretary General's level. The Professional and
Management Development Unit (PMDU) would consist of a small number of high level Ministry
officials, and be in charge of implementing the human resources aspects of the reform of the MOH.
It would be in charge of coordinating all training programs for MOH staff, identify candidates for
scholarships or local training, review curricula and design indicators of efficacy for training
programs. The new structure is shown in Figures 1 and 2.
5.           The new Assistant Secretaries General would be responsible for the main functions
identified in para.2. Each Assistant Secretary General would manage a set of functional directorates,
and would be held accountable for his Directorates' performance.
6.           ASG for Professional and Technical Affairs. This ASG would be responsible for
medical and technical matters, setting of standards, preparation of regulations, supervision of
facilities, and implementation of priority programs. He would be in charge of:
- the Directorate of Maternal and Child Health
- the Directorate of Pharmacy
- the Directorate of Laboratories
- the Directorate of Professional Control
- the Directorate of Health Promotion
- the Directorate of Control of Diseases
- the Directorate of Environmental and Occupational Health
- the Directorate of Central Programs
7.           ASG for Planing. This ASG would have the role of creating an efficient planning
function for the health sector as a whole in the Ministry of Health. He would have to oversee the
development of a strategic framework for safeguarding and improving the health of the Kingdom and
for designing operational guidelines to meet this goal, and to identify and manage resources available
for this purpose. He would manage:



- 89 -
Annex X
Page 3 of 8
- the Directorate of Health Economics and Budgeting
- the Directorate of Operational Planning
- the Directorate of Strategic Planning
8.           ASG for Supplies and Services. This ASG would oversee procurement, supplies,
works and maintenance, and would be responsible for designing and implementing the physical
investment policy of the MOH. He would have authority over:
- the Directorate of Procurement
- the Directorate of General Services
- the Directorate of Supplies and Maintenance
- the Directorate of Construction, Transportation and Mechanics
9.           ASG for Administration and Personnel. This ASG would be responsible for the
general administrative and financial policy of the Ministry. The personnel function under this ASG
would be comprehensive and encompass recruitment, manpower development and training.
Directorates under this ASG would be:
- the Directorate of Personnel
- the Directorate of Health Insurance and Patients Affairs
- the Directorate of Accounting
- the Directorate of Medical Education and Training
- the Directorate of Public Relations
10.          ASG for Quality Insurance. This ASG would take care of functions not performed
at present in the MOH, the need for which haws been demonstrated by the low productivity of
Ministry services, the inadequate enforcement of decisions and the high number of protests over
service delivery, both by patients and staff. He would also oversee the performance of Regional
Authorities. Three Directorates would be created under this ASG:
- the Directorate of Quality Control of Administrative Performance
- the Directorate of Quality Control of Technical Performance
- the Directorate of Quality Control of Financial Performance
III - OManization of Regional Services
11.          The reorganization of the MOH also involves devolution away from headquarters of
the day-to-day operation of health services, and the consolidation of the devolved structure under
three Regional Health Authorities (North, Midlands and South), each headed by an ASG reporting
directly to the Secretary General. Each Assistant Secretary General would control a set of
Directorates for key functions (paralleling at the regional level those at the center), and for service
delivery (see Figure 3).
12.          The Regional Authorities would have six Directorates: (i) the Directorate of
Admninistration and Personnel would overview manpower, training and patients' affairs, (ii) the
Directorate of Supplies and Services would take care of general services, supplies and maintenance,
(iii) the Directorate of Planning would manage financial affairs and operational planning, (iv) the
Directorate of Technical and Professional Affairs would enforce national regulations at the regional
level; (v) the Directorate of hospitals would coordinate hospital management, emergency services,



- 90 -
Annex X
Page 4 of 8
allocation of regional hospital budgets, hospital staff career development, etc., and (vi) the Directorate
of Health would oversee the delivery of primary care and the organization of public health services.
It would also be in charge of coordinating health statistical data and to process it.
IV - Implementation and timetable of the reorganization
13.          The Minister of Health has officially announced the Government's approval of the
reorganization plan for the Ministry of Health and published details of the main changes proposed for
immediate implementation. A seminar presenting the new organization to all senior staff in the
Ministry took place in Amman on October 10, 1992, with the participation of the president of the
Civil Service Commission. Some time has been allowed for the MOH's staff to comment on the new
structure and propose improvements. Meanwhile, the Secretary General has created the two units
directly reporting to him: the Executive Board, and the Professional and Management Development
Unit. The decree making the reorganization official is expected to be approved by the Cabinet before
negotiations.
14.          A draft plan for the implementation of the reorganization has been drawn by the
General Secretary of the Ministry:
a.     During the first half of 1993, transitional management arrangements would be introduced for
Regional Health Authorities, job descriptions for top managerial positions would be finalized
and the Professional and Management Development Unit would have published a detailed
reorganization implementation plan. By the end of June, the reorganization would be
implemented at the central level, an implementation program and a timetable would be ready
for the Regional Authorities, new Directorates at the central level would be set up and
Directors appointed, a strategic plan for the Ministry including resource assumptions would be
prepared for the 1994-95 budgets.
b.     Decentralization / regionalization would be implemented in three phases, with phase 1 starting
in mid-1993. During this first phase, hospital administration would be transferred to the
Regional Authorities, which would still be located in Amman at the time, but which would
start implementing regional staff management, budgetary control procedures, and regional
management information systems. At this stage, the old health directorates in the
Governorates would remain in place, and retain the coordination of primary care services.
c.     During the second half of 1993, technical assistance to the Secretary General would be
available through the Bank project, and new staffing arrangements would be introduced below
Director level. A seminar would be held with all senior staff of the MOH on progress with
the headquarters of the reorganization process (in order to identify major problems in
transfers of competencies and statutory functions), and performance management targets
would be set for Assistant Secretaries General and Directors. A review of the first phase of
regionalization would be performed and targets for staff allocation would be fixed.
d.    In Phase 2 or the decentralization / regionalization process (to be completed by the end of
second year of project implementation), the existing health directorates in Governorates would
disappear, and the three new Health Authorities would gain control over public health

Page 5 of 8
activities, organization of primary care and the referral system. They would also implement
regional maintenance procedures and organize regional planning and control. Their
headquarters would move out of Amman and be established in their respective regions, and
they would prepare their 1995 budget on an autonomous basis. In Phase 3, after evaluation
of the Salt pilot hospital management experiment, hospitals would become more autonomous
and regional management of health care activities would adapt to this new situation in terms
of budget allocation, cost recovery, arrangements, etc.
e.    The full reorganization would be completed before the end of 1994.

ANNEX XI
MON Staff ing Study
Terms of Reference
L     Background
1.           There are at present over 16,300 persons working in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and
the cost of their salaries and wages represents over 60% of the recurrent budget. At the end of 1991,
about 6,800 employees worked in the MOH's hospitals, 6,200 in primary care facilities, and 3,200 in
central and decentralized MOH administrations. MOH has frequently been described as over-staffed
despite shortages of some categories of high level staff, mostly in management and planning/.
2.           As a major provider of health care, MOH is an important employer for medical
professions. In 1990, the Ministry employed 1,772 medical doctors (including over 480 specialists), of
which about 60 worked in Directorates of the MOH. The Ministry also employs about 100 pharmacists,
170 dentists, 630 nurses and 500 midwives. Less qualified paramedical personnel and clerical staff
amounted to over 13,000 persons. Unqualified personnel include thousands of "practical nurses" without
formal training, janitors, clerks, maids, etc.
11 - Adeguacy of manpower supRly
3.           MOH hospitals: In hospitals, about 6,800 staff operate 2,300 beds, i.e., the personnel
per bed ratio is close to 3 (with variations in different hospitals: Princess Basma hospital, to be
rehabilitated under the project, has a ratio of 4 staff per bed). Such a high ratio is high (the average ratio
of personnel per bed in OECD countries is 2.2), but the 1989 Bank sector study "Financing the health
sector rehabilitation in Jordan' found that the staff per bed ratio was lower in MOH hospitals than in
military and University hospitals. Only some facilities in the private sector have a lower staff per bed
ratio. The problem facing the hospital sector is a serious shortage of qualified nurses (there are 0.2
nurses per bed against an average of 0.6 in OECD countries) and midwives and a less serious shortage
of specialist doctors, compared to an oversupply of "practical' nurses, general practitioners and
unqualified staff. Hospitals administrative functions are overstaffed with clerks and janitors (for instance,
all documents for the pay of personnel are handled manually) but lack management professionals.
4.           Primary care facilities: The network of primary care facilities includes 214 VHCs, 274
VHCs, 274 PHCs, 161 MCHs and 18 CHCs. As most of the MCHs are integrated within PHCs, the
total number of primary care facilities amounts to less than 600. The 240 VHCs have one or two
paramedical staff, and the remaining about 400 primary care facilities have a total staff of about 5,800,
i.e., an average of 14.5 per center. Primary care centers operate only during the day time on the basis
of one personnel shift, and have received only about 4 million patients in 1991. At present, the primary
care system provides about 1.5 contracts per person per year, with each doctor having about 4,500 visits
per year. The average for OECD countries is 6,500 visits per year, with each doctor in primary care



- 96 -                      Annex XI
Page 2 of 4
assisted by an average of 2.4 staff (against about 7 in the MOH prinary care system, or 5 if personnel
with no relation to patients are included). A primary care sector study performed in 1989 showed that
80% of VHCs see less than 10 patients per day, and that 56% of primary care doctors see less than 15
patients per day. Given this level of activity and availability to the population (centers close at 4 p.m.),
primary care is heavily over-staffed. An average of 10 staff per center and 1.5 per village clinic would
allow an adequate operation of primary care facilities: the total staff would amount to a maximum of
5,000 rather than the current 6,200.
5.           Administration and manpower development. Overstaffing is also a main feature of
administrative and training facilities with 3,200 staff. It has been noted that the Jordanian MOH employs
more staff for a population of under 4 million than its counterpart in Great Britain for a population of
over 50 million. One of the reasons for this plethora of personnel is that MOH maintains 16 Regional
Directorates in Governorates. The reorganization process, which will regroup decentralized services into
three health regions, will make overstaffing at the administrative level even more apparent. 1990 figures
show that 1,760 persons work in the MOH Directorates, out of which 210 are medical and paramedical
staff.
III - Financial burden of personnel
6.           The MOH budget includes several categories of personnel expenditures, but does not
enumerate the number of employees in each category. Basic salaries of personnel (excluding all
allowances and contributions) represent JD7.5 million for civil servants (54%). JD5.26 million for non-
established civil servants, as they mostly belong on the category of unqualified workers.
7.           Basic salary figures, amounting to JD13.2 million only represent a fraction (41 %) of what
MOH spends on personnel: JD34.2 million. A wide variety of allowances (according to family situation,
diploma, working conditions, etc,) account for about JD18.7 million, i.e., nearly 50% over the basic
salary figures. Increases in allowances and creation of new types of allowances have been used over the
years to improve the situation of civil servants without increasing salaries.
IV - Purpose of the Study
8.           The study will review MOH staffing levels and policy make recommendation on
reallocation and retraining over the short term of MOH reorganization, and propose guidelines for
improving personnel management and reducing overstaffing over the medium and long term. It will
determine how the ongoing MOH reorganization can best reallocate staff in order to make the best
possible use of existing competencies, and provide recommendations on socially and politically acceptable
reductions in the numbers of unqualified and redundant staff.
9.           One of the outcomes of the study will be a set of policy recommendations to the Ministry
of Health on:
overall staffing requirements by unit of management;
the appropriate balance between civil servants and contractual staff;
criteria for hiring and firing different categories staff;



- 97 -                        Annex XI
Page 3 of 4
career management and productivity enhancement measures for staff, including
improved opportunities for training and geographic; and administrative mobility;
opportunities for improving staff utilization by reassigning individuals to
positions where their skills could be better used;
options for staff reduction through natural attrition and non-replacement of
retirees;
the role of new Directorates in charge of personnel management at the Central
and Regional levels.
V - Methodology
10.           The study team of consultants will first prepare a complete and detailed picture of existing
MOH personnel, broken down by:
(a)    profession; doctors (general practitioners and specialists, noting how their diploma is recognized),
nurses (midwives, nurses, assistant nurses, practical nurses), dentists, pharmacists, technical staff (by
specialization and diploma) clerical staff (by level of training and diploma), etc.
(b)    location: primary  care facilities, hospitals, health directorates in Governorates, central
administration by directorate, etc.
(c)    employment status; established civil servants, non-established civil servants, long term contractual
agents, other contractual positions, workers, etc.
(d)    level of pay; salaries, different types of allowances, contributions to health insurance schemes,
retirement contributions, etc.
I1.           The consultants will identify redundancies using performance ratios based on appropriate
international comparisons (in health facilities; number of staff per hospital bed, number of staff per
occupant; in health directorates in Governorates; number of staff per population and per health facility
supervised), analysis of workload and working hours (mostly at the central level, and for clerical and
administrative positions in health facilities), review of qualifications (for example, the very low level of
competence of practical nurses has often been identified as a problem), etc. They will produce a plan
to reduce these redundancies identified in administrative services and primary care facilities (and to lesser
degree in hospitals) by non-renewal of such contracts would not require laying off civil servants.
12.           The study team will make recommendations regarding reallocation of staff presently
working in health directorates in Governorates, and propose solutions for overstaffing based on the
respective rules of retraining, attrition (early retirement, staff transfers), reallocation of staff, non-renewal
of some contracts, and other possible solutions. If any lay-offs are proposed, the study team will prepare
detailed and fully costed proposals for their implementation in a socially acceptable manner.
13.           The consultants will also identify needs for additional personnel.  More competent
management personnel will certainly be needed in hospital management, and the MOH reorganization will
require that competencies presently not found in the Ministry be hired in the future. The consultants will
make recommendations designed to permit hiring of such staff (creation of statutory positions, specific



- 98 -                      Annex XI
Page 4 of 4
budgets, possible linkages between the MOH administration and other Ministries, etc).
VI - Organization of the study
14.          The study will be performed by local consultants under the joint auspices of the Ministry
of Health and the Ministry of Planning, with the assistance of the Civil Service Commission.
15.          The study team will include four persons. It will be led by a senior MOH staff member
with experience in personnel issues. The other team members would include one labor specialist
(preferably from the Ministry of Labor), one health director or hospital director, and one training
specialist (either from MOH or Jordan University). The team will have access to all MOH personnel
data. The team leader will be appointed by the Minister Of Health and the Labor Specialist by the
Ministry of Labor. The team leader would select the two remaining members and propose their
nominations to the Minister Of Health within two weeks of his appointment. Names and qualifications
of team members will be provided to the Bank.
16.          The study team will be selected by September 1994. A detailed methodology will be
finalized within two months. Data collection and analysis will last about four months. Setting up of
policy recommendations and proposals is expected to take an additional eight months, as they would have
to be widely discussed within the outside of the Ministry. A draft report would be available for review
by the Government and the Bank by January 31, 1995. Implementation of accepted recommendations
would take place according to a timetable to be agreed by the Government and the Bank.

Annex XII
Study of MOH Fees
Terms of Reference
I-    Background
1.            The existing system for user fees in MOH facilities is inefficient and inequitable (see
Annex II for further information). MOH hospitals are free for civil servants and military personnel
and their dependents who are automatically enrolled in officially sponsored health "insurance' funds;
hospital services are also free for the poor, the disabled and blood donors. Fees charged to other
patients in MOH hospitals are nominal, and the tariff system is primitive: surgical procedures have
three prices for minor, medium and major surgery, and many procedures are priced below their
actual cost. Nevertheless, many fee-paying patients have less ability to pay than civil servants or
military personnel. PHC visits are also free to participants in civil service and military "insurance'
schemes along with the poor, the disabled and blood donors. Military personnel and dependents pay
an extremely low fee for drugs in primary care facilities. They represent nearly half of PHC contacts
(far more than their share of the population), and the structure of tariffs probably plays an important
role in this high proportion. Civil servants and their dependents, blood donors and disabled citizens,
and the poor pay a little more. Other patients pay higher fees for visits (which still do not reflect full
costs, however) and the full price of drugs. Most of these latter individuals have limited resources
and no health insurance coverage. Many of them work for the Government (and thus suffer from low
public sector wages) but are not classified as civil servants (and thus do not benefit from preferential
fee levels).
2.            Because both charges and collection rates are low in MOH facilities (cost recovery
totaled JD 3.9 million in hospitals and JD 1.6 million in primary care in 1991), total fees amount to
only 11 % of total recurrent costs of JD53 million. Hospital fees have not been updated for years,
and this contributes to the poor efficiency of the cost recovery system. Controls are few, and
facilities directors have little power to recover unpaid bills. This leads to many 'free riders" taking
advantage of the system.
3.            The Government is aware of the problems facing the existing cost recovery system,
and wishes to improve it in order to reduce the burden of MOH facilities on the national budget. In
December 1992, prices for out-patient procedures at MOH hospitals were increased by 10% for non-
insured patients (the poor as identified by the Ministry of Social Development have been exempted),
but the structure of fees has not been amended and the likely effect of the new measure is limited.
The Government and the Bank have agreed in principle on (i) the importance of rationalizing user
fees in order to increase the overall revenues from cost recovery, (ii) the need to set a gradient
between prices charged in primary care facilities and in hospitals, in order to raise attendance at
PHCs and reduce overcrowding and self-referral at hospital OPDs and (iii) the necessity to protect the
poor against price increases in MOH facilities. It has further been agreed that a short term study
would be undertaken during the first year of project implementation on the basis of these principles.



-  100  -                             Annex XII
Page 2 of 3
The study would identify interim fee increases designed to improve availability of an adequate
financing for MOH services.
II -    Purpose of the Studv
4.            The short term study will cover prices for services at MOH primary care facilities and
hospital ambulatory services. The revenue increases it will propose will represent an initial and
partial set of measures, pending the outcome of wider MOH studies (with assistance from the
proposed project) designed to determine the full costs of services and to relate fees more closely with
costs systemwide, along with a feasibility study of a possible national health insurance scheme.
However, the fee structure emerging from the short term study will facilitate immediate Government
decisions to increase cost recovery during the first few years of the project's lifetime.
5.            The new fee structure should have the following characterizations:
-      it should be implementable by the Government immediately, and be politically and socially
acceptable;
-      it should yield financial results at least 25% higher than the present fee structure (both
through increases in prices and better collection of user charges);
-      it should not, however, raise costs to patients to the point where there is a risk of limiting
access to primary care;
-      it should create a gradient between primary care and hospital outpatients care costs, in order
to strengthen the incentive for patients to go initially to primary care facilities rather than
OPDs;
-      it should be easy to administer by accountants and cashiers in health facilities;
-      it should protect the poor against the consequences of fee increases.
III- Methodology
6.            The study team of consultants will first prepare a complete picture of existing user
charges for primary and hospital ambulatory care in Jordan:
(a) - by provider: Ministry of Health, Royal Medical Services, Jordan University, UNRWA, NGOs,
private sector (general practitioners and specialists, and private hospitals and maternity clinics)
(b) - by patient: civil servants and the military and their dependents, workers in the private sector
covered by the Social Security Corporation, blood donors, disabled, patients with certain diseases
(such as tuberculosis, cancer, etc.), the poor (as defined by the Ministry of Social Development).
(c) - by type of service provided: primary care, hospital outpatient services, X-Ray procedures,
laboratory tests, essential drugs, medical and surgical procedures, etc.
7.            The consultants will organize a comparison of prices according to these categories,
and point out major discrepancies and convergence in the system, paying special attention to the



- 101 -                             Annex XII
Page 3 of 3
structure of fees charged by MOH to different types of patients and in different facilities, and to the
equity, efficiency and revenue effects of identified discrepancies. They will relate fees theoretically
charged to monies actually collected by health care facilities, and provide explanations for the
difference and proposals for reducing it.
8.           With respect to equity, the consultants will study the consequences of the present
MOH fee structure on those who can least afford to pay for health care services. The consultants will
use the results of the World Bank 1993 Poverty Assessment in order to define more comprehensively
than at present the population which should be protected from fee increases.
9.           The consultants will also use the most recent data (1992) regarding the volume of
services provided in the different MOH facilities, in order to build a model of total revenues for the
Directorate of Health Insurance. They will evaluate the possible growth of the volume of ambulatory
care provided by MOH facilities, taking in consideration new facilities (such as Tafileh Hospital and
newly opened CHCs), and population growth.
10.          The consultants will then propose a new fee structure, which takes all the above
elements in consideration and abides by the principles outlined in paras 3 and 5. This fee structure
will be submitted to the Bank and the Government for review; after evaluation and discussion by the
Ministry of Health and at a later stage by the Cabinet, it would be implemented during the second
year of project implementation, on the basis of a timetable agreed by the Government and the Bank.
IV -   Organization of the study
!1.          The study will be performed by local consultants under the auspices of the Ministry of
Health. However, as the findings of the study will have an impact across the board, a representative
of the Ministry of Planning will participate in monthly progress meetings of the study team.
12.          The study team will include three persons: it will be led by a health economist with
experience of the Jordanian health system and also include a primary care doctor and a hospital
director (or assistant director). The team leader will be appointed by the Minister of Health; he will
select his two assistants and propose them to the Minister within one week of his own appointment.
Team members' names and qualifications will be provided to the Bank. The team will have access to
all statistical and financial information available in the Ministry of Health, and will use computer
equipment put at their disposal by the Project Implementation Unit.
13.          The study team will be selected by August 31, 1993. Detailed study design, data
collection and analysis will be expected to last no more than nine months. Preparation of the report
will last for not more than six additional months. The report will be ready for Government and Bank
review by January 1995, leading to finalization of an implementation plan for agreed
recommendations and actions. Agreed measures on MOH fees will then be implemented as soon as
the Cabinet will have promulgated them.

ANNEX XIII
STUDY OF JORDANIAN EPIDEMIOLOGY
AND HEALTH PRIORITINS
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Background
1.                 Health conditions in Jordan are among the best in the Middle East, but this
result has been achieved at the expense of a costly health system (total health expenditure amounts to
over 8.5% of GDP). Conditions have improved significantly during the past quarter century: life
expectancy at birth increased from 49 years in 1965 to 67 years in 1990 and infant mortality dropped
from 114 to 38 per 1,000 live births during the same period. These figures compare favorably with
other countries of the Middle East, and with countries with similar per capita GDP (weighted averages
of 64 and 55, respectively). Despite low rates of GDP growth during the past six years, health care
provision has continued to expand and helped keep the health status of the population at a relatively
high level.
2.                 With the average age of the population raising and infectious and parasitic
diseases increasingly under control', chronic and degenerative diseases and injuries among adults are
on the rise, reflecting health risk changes associated with the ageing of the population, industrialization
and urbanization. Cardiovascular diseases, cancers and injuries have increased in the past ten years,
and represent a growing concern for the health system as the proportion of the population aged over 65
is expected to increase from today's 2.6% to 6.8% in 2025?.
3.                 The Jordanian Ministry of Health is ill prepared to face the consequences of the
"epidemiological transition" of the population: its information system does not provide an adequate
1/    Immunization coverage against DPT, Polio and Measles is nearly 90%, and
the 1990 DHS survey found that only 2% of children had never been
vaccinated
2/    Data and projections as provided by the United Nations give the
following breakdown by age group for the population. Less than 5 years
old: 19.5% in 1980, 18.2% in 1990, and 11.8% in 2025. 5 to 14 years old:
30.8% in 1980, 27.6% in 1990, and 22.9% in 2025. 15 to 64 years old:
47.4% in 1980, 51.8% in 1990, and 59.5% in 2025.
3/    Epidemiologic transition : A term introduced by Omran (1971) to describe
"changes in the levels and causes of illness and death that are
occurring in developing countries and have taken place to a large extent

Page 2 of 4
description of the epidemiological status of the population, its prevention programs are still mostly
targeted towards communicable diseases, and it does not have efficient tools to measure the cost-
effectiveness of its interventions. The MOH considers that, once an adequate information system is
implemented through the proposed project, it will be essential to develop new strategies for maintaining
and enhancing the health status of the population in light of changing challenges and priorities over the
medium term, based on a systematic evaluation of the expected evolution of health problems facing the
population, the availability of effective technologies to respond to them, and the cost and feasibility of
appropriate new intervention programs.
Obiectives of the study
4.                  The study would aim at gathering and analyzing information necessary to
evaluate the evolution of the health status of Jordanians, and using the information to identify the main
issues to be addressed in the medium and longer term by the health system. It would investigate (1)
epidemiological trends in the population, (2) how well the health system is handling current and
expected priority diseases and conditions, (3) priority actions that would decrease the burden of these
conditions and their likely cost, (4) preventive measures that would control morbidity in relation with
these conditions and, (5) changes in the health system which would allow for a cost-effective approach
to these conditions.
Organization of the study
5.                  The Study would be carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Health.
The core team and associate staff would be recruited by and responsible to the Secretary General of the
MOH. The study would require both a study of the epidemiology of the population and a study of the
main chronic / non-communicable diseases.
1)    The epidemiological survey
6.                  The epidemiological study would be based on a representative sample of the
whole population, which would be defined with the assistance of the Department of Statistics. The
detailed methodology of the survey would be defined by the study team at the early stages of the study.
7.                  The main topics to be covered by the survey would be:
- socio-economic information on the sample
- acute diseases, including accidents, with indication of the treatment sought I received from the health
care system, etc.
already in developed countries". Peachem et al. : The Health of Adults
in the Developing World, 1991

- chronic diseases
- main risk factors: tobacco, obesity, high blood pressure, environment (industrial and other), lack of
exercise, etc.
- health care system availability to the population
- for women, information on fertility and family planning
Survey data would provide the basis for interim and final reports that would (i) evaluate the overall
incidence of acute conditions and the responsiveness of the health system to them, together with
associated information on, e.g., family planning, by socio-economic status of households and (ii)
include a special study of chronic / non communicable diseases likely to impose increasing burdens on
the health system in coming years.
2)     The chronic / non-communicable diseases study
8.                   This study would be undertaken by sectoral experts, selected for their particular
competence in the conditions to be explored in detail. These conditions would be: (1) cardiovascular
diseases, (2) cancers (particularly lung, ENT, breast, cervix, liver and digestive tract), (3) chronic
respiratory diseases (including asthma, tuberculosis, emphysema, etc.), injuries and their consequences
(traffic related injuries, occupational accidents, home injuries, burns, etc.), occupational diseases,
mental diseases, handicaps (both congenital and acquired), and diseases related to pregnancy and
matermity. The study would concentrate on:
- assessing mortality, morbidity and disability in relation with these conditions
- determining the present approach of the health system to these conditions
- evaluating costs involved in dealing with these conditions
- evaluating prevention programs and recommending new preventive approaches
- recommending investment. regulations. and other actions to be taken by the Government in order to
improve the population's health in a cost-effective way.
Staffin
9.                   The study as a whole would be undertaken by a small core team of high level
experts. The core team would be in charge of organizing the epidemiological survey, and of
coordinating the work of sectoral experts. The team would write an interim report on findings of the
epidemiological survey and a final report incorporating recommendations for Government action, in
terms of new priority interventions and policy changes. The team would also organize follow-up of the



- 105 -                     ANNEX XIII
Page 4 of 4
study with the Government, including a national seminar on findings and recommendations, and
preparation of measures to be taken by the Government.
10.                The core team should consist of three persons:
-     a public health specialist (study coordinator)
-     an epidemiologist
-     a health management specialist
The public health specialist (who would lead the team) would be a high ranking and experienced MOH
officer. The health management specialist would be a doctor with a Masters degree in health
management from Jordan University, with experience in hospital management. The epidemiologist
would be recruited internationally in accordance with Bank Guidelines, and under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
11.                The epidemiological survey would be carried out according to a methodolgy to
be finalized by the core team, with the assistance of the Department of Statistics.
12.                Sectoral experts for the study of non-communicable diseases would be selected
by the study team, after consultation of the Minister of Health, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at
Jordan University, and the head of the Royal Medical Services.

HEALTH FINANCING STUDY
Universal Health Insurance Feasibility Study
Terms of reference
I. Background
1.           Several different systems of health coverage currently coexist in Jordan: the civil
service health insurance fund, managed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), for Government employees
and their dependents; the military health insurance for the military and their dependents; the Social
Security Corporation (which only covers occupational health, but where a project of implementing a
health insurance fund is under study) for private sector employees ; private health insurance schemes
contracted by some private companies to cover their employees; and other arrangements for limited
groups of the population.
2.           All civil servants contribute to the MOH health fund. In 1991, the Fund contributed
about JD 10 million to the cost of operating MOH services on top of the MOH recurrent budget of
nearly JD 50 million. About half of the Fund's revenue come from payments for drugs and medical
fees, and the rest is collected through premiums. Premiums amount to 2% of civil servants' basic
salaries with a minimum of 1 JD and a ceiling of 8 JD. The fund covers all civil servants and their
dependents. It provides free inpatient treatment in MOH hospitals and in Jordan University (under
certain circumstances), and in military and private hospitals when no alternative is available in MOH
facilities or for emergency hospitalizations. Beneficiaries also obtain free medical consultation in
MOH primary health care centers and hospital outpatient departments, as well as reduced charges for
essential drugs delivered in these facilities and drugs purchased from private pharmacies.
3.           The Royal Medical Services resources for 1991 amounted to JD 23 million. About
JD 17 million came from the budget of the Ministry of Defense, while JD 3 million was derived from
cost recovery; premiums on military personnel salaries provided the remaining JD 3 million. All
military personnel contribute 1. 1% of their basic salary with a ceiling of 1.5 JD per month. The
military and their dependents are treated free in Royal Medical Services facilities. Beneficiaries also
obtain treatment in MOH primary care facilities, at lower costs than civil servants, blood donors, the
disabled and the poor.
4.           The Social Security Corporation provides retirement pensions and insurance against
work accidents and occupational diseases for private sector employees. Contributions to the Social
Security Corporation amount to 15% of the payroll (10% is paid directly by employers and the
remaining 5% by employees). It only covers medical expenses related to occupational diseases and
work injuries, and most of these expenses are incurred in the private sector medical facilities. The
Social Security Corporation is sponsoring the feasibility of a health insurance fund for private sector
employees and their dependents; the results of that study would be available be the time the present
study begins.

5.            Private health insurance schemes are usually limited to large companies, which have
in-house funds or integrate a health component in their overall package with insurance companies.
They usually include strict limitations on yearly expenditures, dependent coverage and type of
provider. They normally cover hospitalization and ambulatory care (including pharmaceuticals). It is
estimated that less than 7% of the population of Jordan is covered under such schemes.
6.            In addition, students and their dependents are provided free treatment at the Jordan
University Hospital (JUH), which receives premiums from students and University employees and
charges user fees to other patients. Most of JUH's extra revenues come from the Directorate of
Health Insurance which provides funding in two forms: a JD 2.5 million yearly contribution, and 5%
of the cost charged by JUH for civil servants and their dependents. Some additional funds come from
the Ministry of Education.
7.            UNWRA provides care at low rates for Palestinian refugees.
11. Obiectives of the study.
8.            The present system of financing is complex, inequitable, and not easily sustainable in
the future. The Government finances about 40% of the country's health expenditure, either through
direct budgetary allocations or through insurance funds (financed by earmarked salary-based "premia'
paid by military and civilian Goverrnment employees), and over 90% of this financing is spent on
public sector health facilities, which perform about 2/3 of medical activities in Jordan. In contrast,
the private sector caters for about 1/3 of the population Qess than 15% in the case of hospitalization)
but draws about 60% of health expenditure.
9.            There are limits to the capacity of the Govermnent to increase its financing of health
care costs in line with high and rising demand. The Government is committed to reducing its
budgetary expenditure, and cannot substantially raise charges on the salaries of its employees. Short
term increases in fees and improvement in productivity can help to offset costs on an interim basis,
but other solutions have to be studied for the longer term. Meanwhile, expansion of private sector
care is limited by the number of individuals with the capacity to pay the higher fees charged by
private sector providers.
10.           The present "health insurance' systems do not provide an effective alternative to out-
of-pocket payments by patients for publicly or privately provided services. On the one hand, the
segmentation and lack of coordination betwe-en schemes means that multiple coverage is frequent and
difficult to track down. On the other hand, a substantial part of the population is only partly covered
by existing schemes, and many Jordanians are totally excluded from any scheme. Several studies
point out that most of these "non-insured" are on the verge of poverty as defined by the Ministry of
Social Affairs. Cost recovery is low and the public sector relies heavily on the Government budget.
Finally, the whole system is not geared toward cost control. As a result, health expenditures have
increased substantially in the past few years and now represent over 8.5% of GDP, over 40% of
which is accounted for by the public sector. This level is already high for a middle income country;



- 108  -                              Annex XI
Page 3 of 7
given the current background of economic austefii7 it -becomes crucial to introduce improved
financing mechanisms within the system.
11.          In order not to hamper future economic development plans, health expenditure needs
to stabilize at about its current level. This constraint has led the Jordanian government to consider
exploring new ways of financing health care in order to relieve pressure on the budget while
safeguarding or expanding access to health care. National health insurance has been used in several
countries as a way to redistribute health resources and contain the costs of care. Taking into account
equity and cost contaimnent as guiding principles, the study will evaluate the feasibility of financing
health care in Jordan through a scheme of universal health insurance coverage and will design scheme
adapted Jordan's economic, political, social and legal environment.
III. Organization of the study.
a.     General information
12.           In order to produce financial simulations of system resources and requirements, the
study will need to collect the data outlined below.
13.           Resources
- Breakdown of health expenditures by:
o public/private sources of funds (public health insurance schemes/out-of-pocket payments by
patients and private health insurance schemes)
o medical services (general, surgery, gynecology etc.), subdivided under preventive or
curative care.
o types of facilities (PHC, hospital)
- Breakdown of human resources with quantities and costs into:
o public/private sector
o types of services provided
o types of facilities
14.           Structure of subsidies (costs-prices)
o among mm  by income and category (civil servants, military, private sector employees,
etc.)
o among rovids by sector (public/private), medical services and type of facilities
o among health financing systems (MOH, RMS, Social Security Corporation, etc.)
These data will give a picture of the financial signals sent to different categories of consumers for
different categories of services and facilities. It will also underline the financial burden of these
subsidies for each health financing body.
15.           Users' behavior
o income elasticity for health services at different income levels
*by types of services
*by types of facilities

o price elasticity for health services at different income levels
*by types of services
*by types of facilities
b.    Structure of the new system
16.          Financing of total health expenditures
17.          Health nackage to be provided under the scheme. The study will determine the scope
and coverage of a health insurance package based on meeting the objectives of maintaining or
improving the general health status of the population and responding to health care priorities as well
as financial constraints. The breakdown of health expenditures by type of medical services will be a
basis to design this package, provided the present structure of subsidies, which may have distorted the
relative demand for these services, is taken into account. The breakdown of human resources by
medical services and staffing forecasts will help determine the constraints on the supply side. The
study will review various alternatives, from a package financing only basic services to one exclusively
covering high health expenses. It will then make recommendations on the optimum package for
Jordan and determine the possible role of private insurance.
18.          Optimum public/private mix. Universal health coverage is likely to trigger a rise in
demand from those who are only partially covered or not covered by any existing scheme. Using the
present proportion of private/public sources of funds, the structure of subsidies and the income and
price elasticities for health care, the study will appraise this increase and build scenarios according to
various levels of deductibles and copayments. The study will also determine the appropriate long term
role of the government budget in health care financing.
19.          Basis of contribution. The study will have to determine the most appropriate basis of
beneficiary contributions given the specifics of the Jordanian situation. Options would include
payments made on the basis of direct or indirect taxes, and/or premia based on salaries or assets.
The study will also need to assess the feasibility of having the government budget contribute payments
for the poor and the unemployed. For this purpose, the study will need to develop an accurate and
equitable definition of the poor and to assess the impact of unemployment. Poverty assessments and
other studies such as unemployment projections will provide helpful data and guidelines.
Management of a health insurance fund
o institutional framework
20.          The study will then design the institutional framework for the new scheme
management. Various possible arrangements from public to private status will be reviewed,
along with the desired level of involvement of the Government, the Parliament, employers,
trade unions, providers and consumers.
o management organization
21.          The study will also make recommendations regarding management
organization. Multiple possibilities exist in terms of organization size and structure within a



- 110 -Annex XI
Page 5 of 7
given institutional framework. The optimal arrangement would represent an appropriate trade
off between competition on the one hand and administrative efficiency, risk pooling and
bargaining power on the other hand. The study will recommend the management structure(s)
that would be the most efficient, most effectively favor cost containment by reducing
administration costs, and best alleviate potential inequity due to uneven apportionment of risk
among different client groups. Regions and professional categories served might also provide
organizing criteria for management bodies.
Providers
o structure of fees
22.          The structure of fees and copayments is fundamental in sending signals to
consumers in terms of both services provided and type of service facility. The study will
examine the impact on demand patterns of the present structure of subsidies. Using price
elasticities for services and facilities, the study will design a structure of fees coherent with
both current health priorities and resources, and costs. The study will also determine the
appropriate relationship of fee schedules for the public and the private sector.
o basis of payment
23.           Experience in other countries indicates that the type of payment to providers
can have a considerable influence on the overall cost of the system. A pure fee-for-service
system usually bears serious inflationary risks since health services are mostly supply-driven.
A capitation system, on the other hand, is based only on the number of patients and does not
take into account that risk might be unevenly spread among providers. The fee-for-treatment
option combines the two previous systems but requires a sophisticated information system.
The study will provide recommendations according to simulations based on these various
options and design the structure of payments (i.e. direct payments from the fund management
to the provider or reimbursement of the patient).
Control/legal issues
o institutional relations among parties
24.          In order to secure both cost containment and a reasonable income for
providers, fee structures would need to be negotiated between the government, management
and health providers. The study will propose a mechanism and a legal structure for
consultation and bargaining among the three parties.
o cost control
25.          The study will design mechanisms to control costs at the micro level such as a
possible system for prioritizing hospital investments and facility construction, a posteriori



- 111 -                             Annex XIV
Page 6 of 7
reviews of procedures to control prices and reduce excessive surgery, a national policy and
price structure for drugs, optimal numbers of medical staff, etc. Controls could also be
implemented at the physician level. The study will select the appropriate party to be in
charge of these procedures. Having to use allocated funds in the most cost-effective way,
management would have a strong incentive to apply these controls strictly.
IV. Performance of the study
Staffini
26.                 The study will be undertaken by a core team of experts under the auspices of
the Ministry of Planning MOP). This core team will draw on assistance from experts in different
institutions with specific knowledge on health financing issues (Jordan University, Social Security
Corporation, Higher Council for Science and Technology, private hospitals and insurance companies,
Department od Statistics, etc.). An overseas health insurance specialist financed under project
technical assistance will participate in the core team and assist in selecting and organizing the work of
these experts. The team will write an interim and a final report incorporating recommendations for
Government action, in terms of health financing policy and health insurance coverage for the whole
population. The interim report will be cleared by the Ministries of Finance and Planning before final
recommendations are drafted. The team will also organize a national seminar on findings and
recommendations of the study, and preparation of proposals to be made to Parliament on setting up a
universal health insurance scheme.
27.                 The core team should consist of four persons:
-     a social sector economist (study coordinator)
-     a human resources economist
-     a health management specialist
-     a health insurance specialist (foreign technical assistant)
The social sector economist (team leader) would be a high ranking MOP (or Ministry of Finance)
officer, with experience in health economics and macroeconomic modeling. The human resource
economist would be a specialist in employment, preferably also with experience of Social Security
Corporation management. The health management specialist would be a doctor with a Masters degree
in health management from Jordan University, with experience in hospital management. The health
insurance specialist would be recruited internationally in accordance with Bank Guidelines, and under
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
28.                  Outside experts for different aspects of the study (para 26) would be selected
by the study team upon recommendation of the foreign health insurance specialist as regards their
qualifications, with the agreement of the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Health.

Timetabil
29.                 Before the study begins, the team leader and the human resources economist
will undertake a study tour in Europe and America in order to examine diffeent health insurance
systems and to gather scientific and practical documenttion that would be useful for the performance
of the study. Procurement of computer and office equipment will be made during this tour, so that
work can start immediately upon the return of the two team membes.
30.                 The study will extend over a period of three years; preliminary findings and
recommendations will be available to the Goverment and the Bank at the end of the third project
year. The final report of the study will be available not later than six months after the discussion of
preliminary results and recommendations. It will include all the elements necessary for the
Government to issue new regulations regarding universal health insurance coverage.
Reortin
31.                 The Study would be carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of
Planning. The core team and associate staff would be recruited by and responsible to the Minister of
Planning. The interim and final reports would be provided to the Bank for review, after clearance by
the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning.
