KERALA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Management Summary
i.      The proposed project would assist the Government of Kerala (COK) in
providing water and sanitation services mainly to rural areas now without water
systems or reasonable access to safe water supply. GOK has steadily increased
its funding to the water and sanitation sector which receives about 7% of the
state's Sixth Plan (1980-85) investment. While about 75% of Kerala's urban
population is covered by adequate water supply and sanitation, only about
one-third of the rural population is covered. The project would represent
about 30Z of the sector investment in GOK's Seventh Plan (1985-90), which is
now being finalized. Estimated project costs are Rs 93.7 crores (US$85.2
million) and the proposed IDA credit is US$41.0 million.
ii.     The main project objectives are.to help: (a) improve the operating
efficiency of the sector through staff development and reduction of water
wastage; (b) improve the financial management of the sector through the
implementation of sound accounting systems and the introduction and pursuit
of cost recovery targets; (c) produce piped water supply for about 1.5 million
mostly low-income people, in rural areas with almost no safe supply at present;
(d) upgrade and extend distribution of piped water in the Quilon urban area to
provide access to about 190,000 mostly low income people and to industrial and
commercial establishments; (e) assist low-income households to install house
connections through a loan revolving fund; (f) introduce prototype low cost
sanitation projects in 10 urban and selected rural areas.
iii.    The project would be implemented over five years mainly by the Kerala
Water and Wastewater Authority (KWWA). The low-cost sanitation components
would be implemented by the local bodies with support from KWWA. As the lead
agency in Kerala, KWWA executes almost all sectoral investments in the state
and operates all production and distribution facilities except in ten
municipalities (including Quilon) which own their facilities and operate the
distribution systems. Through the project, KUWA will also provide assistance
to these municipalities to improve operations.
iv.     KWWA has been newly formed as a semi-autonomous agency out of the
Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) and is expected to manage its
operations on a commercial basis. Project objectives involving financial
management and operating efficiency are geared to the institutional strengthen-
ing of KWWA. Technology and project scope are well within the capabilities,
implementation capacity and previous experience of KWWA/PHED. A small Project
Management Unit at headquarters would manage project implementation which would
largely be executed through the regional divisions of KWWA.
v.      KWWA's Engineering Department examined feasible alternatives for the
most economic development of water sources and transmission of water in project
areas. Consideration was given to deferring capital expenditures by phasing
key components. For all the project schemes, the use of surface rather than
ground water proved to be the least cost solution; sufficiently reliable sour-
ces are available for all the project areas. GOK has sanctioned abstraction
rights for all schemes over the life of the project.
vi.     The project will be financed by IDA (50% of the total cost excluding
taxes and duties) an GCOK. GOK will make the funds available to KWWA, the



Quilon Municipality and the local bodies with its usual loan-grant mix of
252-75X for rural schemes, 50%-50% for urban schemes and 0-100% for central
services. For rural schemes, most states in India have higher grant portion of
up to 90% of capital costs. The GOK loans would be at 8.75% annual rate of
interest, amortized over 25 years with a five year grace period.
vii.    For water supply, the project is designed to recover from beneficiaries
the full cost of operation and maintenance from the date of commissioning of
each facility. In the Quilon urban area and in developing rural areas,
accounting for about 60% of total project cost, full debt service cost would
aLso be recovered and minimum rates of return of 3% (QuiLon) and 1% (rural
areas) are expected to be achieved by 1996. In the poorer rural areas, a
progressive share of debt service costs would be recovered, reaching 60X by
1996. In most project areas, no water supply system exists today and tariffs
and cost recovery can only be introduced after completion of project works in
FY89/90. In Quilon, an inadequate system exists and the water charges do not
cover operating and maintenance costs. An interim tariff increase of 50% would
be introduced in Quilon by December 31, 1987 to cover operating and maintenance
costs and to move tariffs towards the level expected to be required after
commissioning of the project facilities in 1990. Also, KWWA would introduce a
minimum 20% tariff increase by December 31, 1987 for non-project areas where
its systems are currently available. KWWA is expected to cover all its costs
by 1990.
viii.   A cost and revenue study, financed under the project would review the
applicability of project financial targets to the whole FWWA service area and
recommend a tariff structure to be implemented by 1990. Cost recovery is
constrained by the cost of new systems and the level of affordability and
"ewillingness to pay", which is estimated in Kerala at about 2% of household
income. Nevertheless, the financing formula and cost recovery targets estab-
lished for this project would enable GOK to proceed with its planned extension
of service coverage to the majority of the population in the State, while
remaining within its projected resource availability, with proper operation and
maintenance of completed facilities also ensured.
ix.     For the low cost sanitation components, cost recovery would be accord-
ing to the guidelines of the Technology Advisory Group (TAG) under the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP). The household beneficiaries would own and
maintain their own units and the purchase would be Einanced by mix of debt and
grants according to means. For sewerage service, which exists in only two
cities, KWWA's newly introduced accounting system will indicate the adequacy of
current revenue to cover costs and on this basis KWWA will consider what chan-
ges are needed in the sewerage tax and/or charges to cover any deficit. No
sewerage works are included under this project.
x.   The project is justified in terms of: (1) the improvements in KWWA's
operations and sector financial management; (2) the project's economic rate
of return, which ranges from 7X-14Z over the water supply-subprojects; and (3)
the physical objective of meeting priority needs for safe water supply and
improved sanitary conditions.



I. BACKGROUND
A.  India - National Population Trends
1.01    India is primarily an agricultural country with about 76% of its
population living in rural areas. According to the 1981 census data, India's
total population was estimated at about 685 million. The urban population of
India has expanded rapidly since 1971, from about 108 million (20.2% of total
population) to about 158 million in 1981 (23.72 of total population). This
increase, due partly to immigration from rural areas, corresponds to a total
annual growth rate in urban population of 3.8% during the 1971-81 period
(compared to 3.3% during the previous decade). The net growth rate in the
rural areas has been lower (1.75% per annum during the 1971-81 period), but
nevertheless the total rural population increased by 86 million during the
decade. Growth rates in both urban and rural areas are creating rapidly
expanding demands for housing and for the provision of services, such as
water supply and sanitation. While the Central Government has been address-
ing this problem in urban areas for some time, through the substantial
investment programs in the National Plans, it has only recently begun to
focus attention on improvements in rural areas.
B. The Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
1.02    The Central Government exercises some influence in the sector through
budgetary support, but the State Governments have primary responsibility for
the development of water supply and sewerage facilities through various
implementing departments and agencies which, in turn, may delegate part or
all of their duties to local authorities. In certain cases, legislation has
been enacted to permit municipal authorities or other local agencies to
assume the entire responsibility for planning, design, construction, opera-
tion and maintenance of water supply and sewerage services within their
juribdictions.
1.03    Prior to 1975, due to competing resource demands from other sectors,
as well as the lack of management skills and shortages of key materials,
investments in the sector amounted to only about 1% to 2% of total public
expenditures. This situation improved slightly during the Fifth Plan
(1974-78) and the two annual plans (1978-80). Investment for urban water
supply and sewerage during the Fifth Plan averaged Rs 1100 million per year,
or about 1.5% of the total Plan investment; the corresponding figure for the
rural areas was Rs 750 million, or about 1.0% of the total Plan's invest-
ments.
1.04    Although these investment levels did result in improvements in the
sector, they were still quite inadequate to achieve substantial progress in
overall service levels in the context of the rapidly increasing population.



-2-
Thus in 1980, it was estimated 1/ that in India about 287 million people, or
42% of the total population, had access to reasonably safe drinking water and
that only 43 million (6% of the population) were covered by sanitation serv-
ices. These figures were among the lowest levels for all developing
countries.
1.05    The Government of India (GOI) recognized the importance of raising
these service levels and adopted the concepts of the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade. The following targets were established,
to be achieved in India by 1990:
- Urban and rural water supply: 10O coverage
-  Urban waste disposal:  80% coverage
- Rural sanitation: 25Z coverage
In response to these targets, GOI has greatly increased the amount of funds
available to the sector.  Thus in the Sixth Plan (1980-85), 4Z of the total
Plan provision has been allocated to the sector.  Under this plan, the rural
sector receives an average of Rs 4,300 million per year, about 2.2% of the
Plan. The urban water supply and sanitation sector will receive an average
of Rs 3,500 million per year, or about 1.8% of the Plan. These figures
represent approximately four times the investments made in the individual
sectors under the previous Plan, and reflect the importance which GOI
attaches to the Decade program. The increased emphasis on the rural sector
is particularly evident. The Seventh Plan (1985-1990) is currently being
prepared; the proportional allocation to the sector is anticipated to be even
higher than that of the Sixth Plan.
1.06    While these investment levels do represent substantial increases, it
must be recognized that the Decade goals (as stated above) are unlikely to be
reached fully by 1990. Studies 1/ have shown that there will still be a
substantial shortfall in funds and that lack of sufficient qualified manpower
will also be a constraint. The existing institutional problems (paras
1.28-1.32) are also likely to limit the rate of growth which can be achieved
in the sector. Equally important in sustaining the achievement of the tar-
geted service levels is the efficient operation and maintenance of the sys-
tems. This aspect has always presented a serious challenge to the respon-
sible authorities, and institutional strengthening and intensive training of
personnel at all levels in the sector will be needed to achieve the required
standards.

C.  The State of Kerala
1.07    The State of Kerala is located on a narrow stretch of land along
India's southwest coast. Its area of 38,864 km2 is divided among coastal
plains, midlands and highland regions.  In 1981 the populati n of Kerala was
estimated to be 25.5 million (a density of 650 people per km ), with about
17Z of the people living in urban areas. Since the early seventies, Kerala's
urban population has grown at an average rate of 2.3% a year while its rural
population has increased by 1.8% annually.  There are now fourteen towns with
populations of over 50,000.  The largest municipality is Cochin with a
population of about 515,000; the capital, Trivandrum, has a population of
about 480,000.  The weather in the State is generally humid and tropical with
a temperature range of 22-34 degrees C and an average annual rainfall of
3,100 mm. Kerala receives both the southwest and northwest monsoons from
June to November, with the remaining six months of the year being relatively
dry.
1.08    The State's economy is dominated by agriculture which accounts for
44X of its net State domestic product.  The major crops are tapioca, rice,
rubber, and cashews.  Nearly 25,900 km2I or two-thirds of the land in Kerala,
is farmed and, of this, 7,000 km are irrigated. The average annual per
capita income in the mid-seventies was 10% below the all-India average of Rs
988. Literacy rates are over 75%, compared with the all-India average of
47Z.
1.09    Although the statistics for life expectancy and infant mortality in
Kerala are also much better than the all-India averages, surveys indicate
serious underlying health problems. The recorded incidence of many diseases
is high; in particular, there is a vet.: high occurrence of intestinal
parasitism which can be attributed to inadequate water supply and sanitation
services.
D. Water Resources in Kerala
1.10    Unlike many other states in India, Kerala has generally satisfactory
water resources. Forty-one rivers flow down from thb ghats on the State's
eastern border. These yield an average of 64,300 Mm of water annually, of
which 57% is now being utilized. During periods of low flows, these rivers
are subject to tidal and saline intrusion which makes them unsuitable for
either irrigation or domestic consumption in the coastal areas. Structures
have been constructed to regulate the tides but they also obstruct naviga-
tion. Therefore, multi-purpose upland reservoirs have been proposed to
regulate the flow of fresh water. About a tenth of the annual yield from the
ghats flows eastward into Tamil Nadu; rights to exploit this water are being
negotiated between the two states. Irrigation facilities have been installed
in eight of the river basins. In addition, four hydroelectric projects have
been completed and 12 more are pending. Studies conducted by Central and
State hydrogeological departments indicate that although groundwater exists



-4-
in the coastal belt, only one localized aquifer in the Quilon - Alleppey Area
is capable of yielding good quality water in appreciable amounts (tubewell
yields of 40-95m3/h). In other areas of the coastal region, yields are low
and unreliable and the quality is poor. In the rocky inland zone, potential
for groundwater development is limited and uneconomical. The average yield
of wells in this zone is in the order of 40m3/day. A water resource plan is
intended to be prepared over the next few years for Kerala by the Center for
Water Resources, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, COI.
E. Sector Investment and Service Levels in Kerala
1.11    The Government of Kerala (COK) has adopted COI's targets for the
International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, and has made a
heavy commitment to improving conditions in the sector. In the State's Sixth
Plan, the allocation to the sector represented 7% of the total investment
(double the amount provided in the previous plan); this can be compared with
the corresponding national figure of 4Z. So far, the emphasis of GOK's
investment program has been on water supply rather than sanitation. In
particular, the Sixth Plan has given priority to rural water supply, which
received some 65% of the sectoral allocation. However, because of the large
rural population, the per capita investment in rural water supply has been
only about half that for urban water supply. Kerala's past investments in
water supply and sanitation are shown in Annex 2.
1.12    The resulting service levels in the State are shown in Table 1.1
below.

Very substantial progress has been made in the Eield of urban water supply
since 1974 and presently about 76% of the population receives a piped supply
(1983 figures). While the achieve-nent in rural water supply has been con-
siderable, the proportion of the rural population receiving a piped supply
is still only about 31%. The remainder of the population (both urban and
rural) depend on wells or streams for their suppLy. For those who are
provided with a piped supply, the average per capita supply in towns of over
35,000 population is currently abou. 135 lpcd; in intermediate sized towns
(down to 20,000 population) the figure is about 90 lpcd; in small towns and
rural areas about 25 lpcd is provided. There are presently 33 piped water
supply systems in the State; all rely on surface water sources, except for
three systems which depend on ground water.
1.13    In the field of urban sanitation, there are now very few people
without some type of permanent disposal facility. This has been achieved bv
a steady increase in the number of septic tanks (serving 40% of the popula-
tion) and latrines (serving 53%). Waterborne sewerage systems are provided
in two cities, Trivandrum and Cochin; these serve about 262 and 2% of their
respective populations. The situation in rural sanitation is much less
satisfactory; 37% of the population use pit latrines and, apart from some
water-seal latrines, the remainder of the population has no sanitary
facilities whatever.
1.14    In reviewing these existing service Levels against the Decade targets
for 1990, it is clear that the largest shortfall is in rural water supply. A
very substantial investment of funds and management efforc will be needed to
provide compLete coverage of the population and it is unlikely that the
Decade target will be achieved before at least the mid-1990s. The target for
urban water supply, though Less challenging, is still unlikely to be reached
by 1990. Although statistics indicate that that the Decade targets for the
sanitation sector (rural coverage: 25X; urban: 80%) have already been ful-
filled, much of the coverage is provided by simple pit Latrines, which should
not be regarded as a satisfactory long-term solution; moreover in rural areas
only about a third of the population have some form of coverage. Studies by
the UNDP Technology Advisory Group have indicated that twin-pit pour flush
water-seaL latrines would be appropriate to conditions in Kerala and have
recommended that a program of conversion and up-grading of latrines should be
undertaken.
1.15    Details of the State's Seventh Plan have not yet been finalized (para
4.01), but it is understood that COK intends to continue to concentrate its
investment in rural water supply (albeit at a somewhat lower proportion of
the total Plan allocation for the sector). The proportional allocation to
urban water suoply is expected to remain about the same, but the amounts
provided for urban sanitation/sewerage and rural sanitation are likely to



-6-
rise sharply. The anticipated large investment in the urban sanita-
tion/sewerage sector results from ;he GOI policy to install waterborne
sewerage in all Class I towns (over 100,000 population).
1.16    These anticipated investment levels reflect OOK's perception of the
State's needs during the Seventh Plan Period and broadly correspond to the
outstanding shortfalls in meeting the Decade goals. The principal exception
is the priority being given to urban sewerage. At this stage of development,
it would be appropriate to defer large investment in waterborne sewerage
systems and to place even greater emphasis on providing new rural water
supply schemes.
F. Sector Organization in Kerala
1.17    Until March 1984, the planning, design and construction of all water
supply and sewerage works in the State was the responsibility of the Public
Health Engineering Department (PHED), which formed part of the Ministry of
Local Administration. PHED was also responsible for the operation and main-
tenance of all schemes, with the exception of the distribution systems in
ten municipalities. 1/ In these ten towns, the municipalities owned and
operated the distribution systems, set tariffs _,a collected the revenues;
they also paid PHED for operating their production facilities. In other
towns where the assets of already established systems were owned by the local
bodies, PHED, as an agent, collected directly from connected consumers and
charged the local bodies for all operating, maintenance and overhead costs.
1.18    Under these  organizational arrangements, PHED's responsibilities in
the sector were limited. There was no obligation for the Department to match
its revenues with its expenditures, since additional funds could be sought
from Ministry budgets on a regular basis. Thus, there was little incentive
to minimize operational costs or to set up effective accounting and cost
control systems. Similarly there was no incentive for the Department to
propose revisions in the levels of tariffs.
1.19    Consequently in March 1984, GOK passed an Ordinance which transformed
PHED from a government department into a semi-autonomous authority -- the
Kerala Water and Wastewater Authority (KWWA). The Ordinance, which is now in
the process of becoming an Act, gives the new Authority a much more clearly
defined and larger role in the sector than in other states in India. The
Authority will have wide responsibilities for planning, design, implementa-
tion, operation, maintenance and financial control of Kerala's water supply
1/ The ten municipalities are the ten largest towns in Kerala (except for
Trivandrum).   They own their water systems; Cochin is unique in owning
only the distribution system and is therefore charged a bulk rate. In
Trivandrum, the systems are State owned.



-7-
and sewerage systems. Except for minor works in the State's Seventh Plan,
KWWA will be responsible for the Plan's implementation in the sector. With a
Board of senior COK officials, KWWA will be more autonomous than agencies
within ministries and have the power to initiate proposals for tariff revi-
sions and to deal directly with local bodies. KWWA owns the water supply
systems in the Trivandrum metropolitan area where it sets the tariffs. All
new water supply schemes will also be owned by KWWA. The structure of opera-
tion and ownership of Kerala's water supply systems, as of 1985, is sum-
marized in Annex 20.
1.20    The local bodies, which currently own their own assets, and the ter-
municipalities. which currently operats their own distribution systems, will
continue to do so for the time being and will pay KWWA charges to cover its
operating costs related to their systems.   However, under the Ordinance, at
any time after three years COK is empowered to assign to KWWA the full
responsibility and ownership for the production and distribution of water in
the municipalities and towns. The criteria for such a takeover are left to
COK's discretion but the implication is that the municipalities must, within
the three year period, improve their current performance in operating, main-
taining, billing and collecting and must meet their financial commitments
to KWWA. With such improvements, the municipalities would retain their
control over distribution. Facilities for training and central services,
provided under the project, would be made available also to the ten
municipalities to help their current operations.
1.21    Responsibility for implementing and operating urban sewerage systems
rests with KWWA. It is intended that the low cost sanitation programs (both
urban and rural) will be implemented by the local bodies, assisted by a
special cell set up in the KWWA. The individual facilities will then pass
into the ownership of the householders with cost recovery and back-up serv-
ices being the responsibility of the local bodies. Responsibility for opera-
tion of public latrines will continue to rest with the local bodies, which
often sub-let this work to private contractors who levy charges for use of
the facilities.
G. Sector Finance in Kerala
1.22    The water and sanitation sector in Kerala has been financed by COK
funds and direct loans to PHED from the Life Insurance Corporation of India
(LIC). GOK funds for capital works have been provided on a loan-grant mix of
25Z-75Z for raural schemes and 50X-50Z for urban schemes. In the Sixth Plan,
the grant portion was equivalent to about 2/3 of the sector investment or
about Rs 17 crore a year, equalling 4-1/2Z of the annual plan. PHED also
required subsidies from COK to cover its debt service obligation and, due to
poor collections, some of its operating costs (para 1.24). In principle, the
tariffs and charges set were adequate to cover PHED's direct operating and



-8-
maintenance costs. At the inception of KWWA, GOK loans to PHED were con-
sidered as an equity contribution to the new Authority; only loans from LIC
appear on KWWA's balance sheet. (See Annex 19).
1.23    For water supply, domestic metered tariffs in major cities -i Kerala
typically range between Rs 0.40-0.60 per 1,000 litres. These rates are
comparable to those charged in the major Indian cities. In Kerala, commer-
cial and industrial tariffs are in most instances at least double the domes-
tic rate; this ratio tends to be larger in many other Indian cities, par-
ticularly in Bombay. Since all house connections in Kerala are metered,
there are no flat rates. In addition, all municipalities impose a water tax
(averaging 3Z of the Annual Rental Value) and a sanitation tax (averaging 4Z
of the Annual Rental Value).
1.24    The collection of tariffs by PHED and the municipalities was low and
GOK has been unwilling to compel the municipalities to make required payments
to PHED. Because of PHED's lack of emphasis on financial performance and its
poor accounting system, an accurate billing and collection record is unclear.
(Estimates and projections of KWWA's finances are given in Annex 19). Tax
revenue to pay for the sewerage services in Cochin, and Trivandrum is also
inadequate but it is unclear by what degree. KWWA is now impLementing
accrual accounting and financial information systems that will supply better
information on both water supply and sewerage costs.
H. Bank Group Program and Performance in the Water Supply ane Sanitation
Sector in India
On-going Program
1.25    The Bank Group's involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector
in India began in 1974 with the Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(Credit 390-IN of January 1974). Since then, the Bank has made available
eight credits totalling US$602 million for water supply and sewerage projects
and provided a further US$190 million for water supply and sewerage as part
of a broader program of infrastructure development in urban areas. Two
projects have been completed: the Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project
which financed water transmission, distribution and treatment facilities and
expansion of the sewerage system in the Greater Bombay area; and a credit for
Uttar Pradesh (Credit 585-IN) which supported the construction of water
supply and sewerage facilities for five large towns and provided safe piped
water to a number of smaller towns and villages. 1/
1/ Ongoing projects cover -water supply and sewerage for Bombay (follow-up
project, Credit 842-IN), Punjab (Credit 848-IN), Maharashtra (Credit
899-IN), Rajasthan (Credit 1046-IN), Gujarat (Credit 1280-IN) and Tamil
Nadu (Credit 1453-IN, Special Fund 16-IN). Rural water supply schemes
were also included in the two Haryana Irrigation projects (Credits 841-IN
and 1314-IN).



-9-
1.26    The two Bombay projects have addressed the water supply and sewerage
needs of a single metropolitan area. The other seven water supply and
sewerage projects have assisted statewide programs that have included design
and construction activities conducted by semi-autonomous state agencies. The
First, Second and Third Calcutta Urban Development Projects (Credits 427-IN,
756-IN and 1369-IN) and the Madras Urban Development Project (Credit 687-IN)
have provided water supply and sewerage facilities as part of a composite
program to develop urban infrastructure.
1.27    The Bank group's goals in the sector are:  to support the central and
state government s overall objective of extending water and sanitation serv-
ices to a majority of the population; and to assist in improving the
efficiency of sector operations. In pursuit of these goals, Bank projects
have: (a) promoted institutional development through staff training and the
introduction of operating efficiencies; (b) encouraged sound financial
management through the adoption of commercial styLe accounting systems and
controls; (c) assisted in the formulation of tariff policies to promote
conservation and equitable access to water and cost recovery; and (d)
fostered the reevaluation of design standards and the adoption of lower cost
technologies.
Project Performance
1.28    The physical works financed by the Bank Group have been implemented
satisfactorily, although moderate delays in implementation have been
encountered in most projects. Efforts to reduce costs through the judicious
selection of service standards and the use of lower-cost technical options
have been increasingly successful. Several programs to develop, test and
Dromote low-cost sanitation technologies, have been undertaken by state
-overnments and by the World Bank/UNDP Technical Assistance Project (UNDP
GLO/78/006). The major- concern on the physical side has been the unsatisfac-
tory standards in the operation and maintenance of completed facilities,
which is directly linked to institutional and financial issues.
1.29    In India, strong public opposition to tariff increases and metering
of consumption has arisen from the traditional concept held, by both consumer
and government alike, that water and sewer services are a "public good" which
should be provided free of charge, as are medical care and education.
However, there are increasingly competitive demands on the limited property
tax revenues for provision of a wide range of other local services (such as



-10-
road construction and maintenance, solid waste collection and drainage) where
the opportunities for direct user charges are more limited than they are for
water. There is a growing recognition among policy makers that in order to
extend water and sanitation service coverage to the majority of the popula-
tion, the sector must strengthen its institutions and generate a larger
portion of its funds through direct user charges.
1.30    Past projects have not been fully successful in achieving institu-
tional, financial or economic goals. The GOI shares the Bank's concern over
this and is collaborating with IDA through the CentraL Ministry of Works and
Housing and the relevant State Governments in a review of past performances.
The objectives of this on-going study are to identify the reasons for not
achieving agreed upon targets and to lay out an action plan for improving
future performance. The study is also expected to provide a basis for futher
dialogue with GOI and State Governments on sectoraL issues.
1.31    The review has revealed that many of the initiatives agreed under
past projects have not been fully or successfully implemented. These
failures have contributed to inadequate cost recovery and thus
under-financing of operations and maintenance. The difficulties in
retrospect appear to have resulted from several interrelated problems. First,
the initiatives themselves were ambitious. Projects have sought the reor-
ganization of participating agencies and introduced wholly new concepts and
targets for cost recovery and new systems for reporting and accounting.
Often the agency role in the sector was not sufficiently well defined and the
statutory practices were ignored for the operation of the public agencies.
Second, the reforms and the detailed operating procedures needed to implement
them have not been developed in sufficient detail or adequately presented.
In several cases, the agencies have relied heavily on local consultants with
limited experience in sector finances or operations. Additionally, incentives
to promote change that accrue to the managers of water supply and sanitation
agencies have not been recognized and modified to encourage reform. Third,
the process of innovation has itself been poorly managed. Realistic
schedules needed for phasing in and implementing new procedures have not been
planned nor coordinated with the training and technical assistance needed to
facilitate the changes.
1.32    The growing acceptance by GOI of the fundamental objectives incor-
porated in the Bank's sector program suggests that there is a substantial
potential to achieve improved sector performance over the medium to
long-term. Persistent supervision of ongoing projects and strengthened
sector policy work will be required to achieve this. It must be recognized
that the attitudinal and institutional adjustments underway in the sector
will take time and that project objectives need to be tailored to this
reality. Follow-up projects and the extension of projects to other States
are still needed to maintain continuity and consistency in the sector policy
dialogue and to pursue the issues now being identified in more detail. At
the same time, more active participation by Central Government agencies as



-11-
policy intermediaries for dissemination of sector policies and experiences to
the different State governments is envisaged for the future.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Rationale
2.01    The Kerala project has been formulated with the broad aim of improv-
ing institutional, operational and financial performance throughout the
sector, while also tackling specific physical needs which have been iden-
tified.  The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to help strengthen sector-wide management in the newly
created KWWA and municipalities which operate their own
distribution systems by promoting manpower training,
operational efficiency (through the reduction of water
wastage and improved central services), sound accounting
systems and development of cost recovery targets.
(b)  to provide piped water supplies to about 1.5 million people
residing in six rural areas, most of whom have no safe supply
at present.
(c)  to increase the supply of water and to extend the distribution
facilities in one urban area so as to provide reasonable access
to about 190,000 (mostly low income) people;
(d)  to introduce low-cost on-site sanitation facilities and to
finance their construction so as to benefit about 200,000
people residing in ten urban areas and to undertake a similar
pilot program for low-cost sanitation in rural areas.
2.02    During project preparation, consideration was given to the points
discussed in paras 1.28-1.32 regarding Bank sector experience in India.
Circumstances in Kerala appear particularly appropriate for a state-wide
water supply and sanitation project. With demonstrable poLitical support
from GOK, the implementing body KWWA has been formed out of PHED with clear
authority to function as the semi-autonomous agency for the sector. Unlike
similar lead agencies, in other state projects, KWWA has the responsibility
for production, distribution and retail of water services and has the
statutory obligation to run on commercial lines. Before Appraisal, GOK had
hired local consultants to help KWWA set up accrual financial systems, do
preliminary financial and socio-ecoi )mic studies, and review the organiza-
tional structure. These consultants had previous sector experience both with
other agencies in India and with other Bank projects. Project objectives
were designed in view of these studies and KWWA current capabilities. The



-12-
Action Plan (Annex 8) is structured to help clarify the implementation of the
project's institutional and policy components and to assist the monitoring of
this process. The project's major goals of improved cost recovery and
operating efficiency in the sector would be phased in over a five year
period. By 1990, when the project is commissioned and the financial targets
become effective, KWWA's financial and reporting systems, leak detection and
training prograLms would be in place.
2.03    The engineering components of the project have been selected by GOK
and IDA staff consistent with the State's sectoral objectives, as discussed
in paras 1.11 to 1.16 above. Thus the project water supply is directed to
rural communities which currently have no piped water, and in particular to
those which have unsafe or distant sources of supply; about 75% of the
project's funds will be allocated to this component. A small urban water
supply component is also included, to provide up-grading and extension of an
existing system; this component will also allow operational techniques (such
as leakage control) to be developed and tested under the project. Low cost
sanitation components are included, in the form of pilot programs for both
urban and rural areas. In view of the high cost of water-borne sewerage
systems and the other more pressing priorities in the sector, no sewerage
component has been included in the project.
B. Selection Criteria for Project Components
2.04    In determining the priorities for the development of individual water
supply schemes, GOK has paid close attention to meeting the needs of "problem
villages". l/   COK has identified priority areas comprising rural areas
which have a high proportion of problem villages together with urban areas
which have poor existing supplies. The six rural and one urban water supply
schemes included in the project have all been selected from this priority
list. About 80% of the rural water supply schemes cover villages in the
'problem village' category. Other priority schemes included in the Seventh
Plan are being financed by State funds or by Dutch and Danish bilateral aid.
2.05    The locations of the selected water supply schemes are indicated on
Map IBRD 18422. The rural schemes cover the areas of: Puthencruz, Adoor,
Chithara, Vilappil, Kottayam, parts of the Greater Cochin Development Area
(GCDA) and rural panchyats surrounding Quilon Municipality; the urban com-
ponent provides improved and extended service to Quilon Municipality.
11 GOI has defined "problem villages" as: those which lack a reliable
supply within a depth of 15m or a distance of 1.5km; or those in which
the supply either has a high incidence of water-related disease or con-
tains excessive fluorides, iron or chlorides.



-13-
2.06    In determining appropriate supply levels, the rural areas have been
divided into two categOrieS: 'stable' and 'developing'. The 'stable' areas
are expected to retain their rural character over the project period and to
generate no industrial and limited commercial demand for water supply. The
'developing' rural areas lie close to existing major towns which are expected
to expand their zone of influence into the adjacent rural areas; in these
areas it is anticipated that a significant industrial demand will develop and
that a higher proportion of house connections can be afforded by the domestic
consumers. The schemes for Kottayam, GCDA and Quilon panchyats are
categorized as developing rural areas, while the remaining rural areas are
regarded as stable.
2.07    The ten towns covered by the urban low-cost sanitation project are
shown on Mep IBRD 18422. These towns, which are not covered by the GOK or
bilateral programS, were selected by GOK and the Technology Advisory Group
(TAG) 1/ as a pilot project on the basis of socio-economic and physical
conditLons in the state. The rural low-cost sanitation component has been
included as a pilot program for future development; towns to be covered by
this component vill be identified in the feasibility study to be undertaken
by TAG.
C. Project Description
2.08    The principal project components are summarized below.  Further
details of the water supply schemes are included in Annex 7.
Rural stable Areas - Design and construction of four new schemes to
provide a design total supply of 32 million liters per day (mld) to
four rural 'stable' areas: Puthencruz, Adoor, Chithara and Vilappil.
Each scheme will rely on a single source and will include an intake,
treatment plant, transmission, distribution works and meters.
Rural Developing Areas - Design and construction of schemes to
supply three rural 'developing' areas: Quilon panchayats, Kottayam
panchayats and the Greater Cochin Development Area (GCDA). The
design supplies for these schemes total 147 mld; Quilon panchayats
will share the production facilities of the Quilon Municipality
(see below). Each scheme will rely on a single source and will
include treatment plant, transmission, distribution works and
meters. A plan of the system for GCDA is shown in Map IBRD 18424.
1/ The TAG program is administered by the World Bank under the UNDP India
Low Cost Sanitation Projects (IND/81/014 and IND/84/016) and the UNDP
Interregional Project (INT/81/047).



-14-
Urban Area - Design and construction of a scheme to augment the
supplies to the Quilon Municipality. The design supply of the scheme
will be 33 mld. The scheme will include intake, treatment plant,
transmission, distribution works and meters. RepLacement of a
deteriorated transmission pipeline will reduce water wastage. A plan
of the system for Quilon and its panchayats is shown in Map IBRD
18423.
Urban Low Cost Sanitation - A prototype subproject to provide
low-cost sanitation facilities to 10 towns which have been selected
under the UNDP India Low-Cost Sanitation Project.
Rural Low Cost Sanitation - A similar prototype subproject to
provide low-cost sanitation facilities to rural areas in the State;
the scope and locations will be determined in a feasibility study to
be undertaken by a team from the Technology Advisory Group (TAG) of
the UNDP India Low-Cost Sanitation Project.
Technical Assistance - Assistance to KWWA and to the Municipalities
(which currently operate their own distribution systems) in
developing sector-wide training services and providing centralized
services which will include leak detection units, meter repair
facilities, workshops, laboratories and stores. In addition,
consulting services are included for implementation of
comprehensive financial systems, training in these systems, a
valuation of KWWA's assets and a state-wide water tariff study.
Revolving Fund for Connections - A revolving fund for the provision
of loans to assist low-income households to meet their costs for
completion of house-connections.
D. Operational Action Plan
2.09    There are a number of interrelated project activities to be under-
taken by participating agencies with the common aim of improving their
operating efficiency and financial viability. Although these actions are
discussed in various places of the SAR, because of their interdependence
these have been grouped into an Operational Action Plan. The components of
this Plan were discussed during appraisal with GOK anid KWWA and the timing of
their implementation were reviewed and confirmed during negotiations.
Assurances were received at negotiations that KWWA will annually review and
update the Action Plan in a form that is satisfactory to IDA. The elements
of the Plan are included in Annex 8.
E. Engineering Feasibility Studies
2.10    Frc.a a technical and engineering point of view, the project has been
well conceived. The feasible alternatives have been studied and the overall
designs of the proposed schemes represent least cost solutions. Particular
aspects of the preliminary designs will be further refined by KWWA during the
detailed design stage (for example, the optimum phasing of construction of
the service reservoirs).



-15-
F. Cost Estimates and Financing
2.11    The estimated cost of the cotal project :s Rs 937 million (US$85.2
million) including contingencies, duties and taxes. The estimated costs of
components with the breakdown of local and foreign costs are summarized in
Table 2.1. Estimated annual expenditures are shown in Annex 1.
2.12    Civil works costs are based on the quantities estimated in the
preliminary designs and the prevailing rates for construction. Materials and
equipment costs are based on estimates from Indian and foreign suppliers and
on recent supply contracts. Physical contingencies have been allowed at 10%
of the base cost for civil works and 5% for materials and equipment. Price
contingencies for both local and foreign costs have been projected in accord-
ance with standard IDA guidelines, as follows (base costs as of January 1,
1985).
Fiscal Year                 Local Costs        Foreign Costs

2.13    An amount of US$41.0 million, representing about 50z of the total
project cost of US$82.3 million excluding duties and taxes is proposed to be
financed as an IDA credit. GOK will finance the remaining project costs
through budgetary allocations in the State's Seventh Plan.
C. Consulting Services
2.14    In addition to the engineering feasibility studies completed by KWWA,
two other studies were financed by KWWA and carried out by consultants as a
part of project preparation;
(a) a study of the organizational structure, staffing, systems and
procedures needed for the newly formed KWWA; this was accompanied
by a preliminary tariff study and a socio-economic survey to
establish affordability levels and the preparation of financial
projections for the Authority.
(b)  an accounting and finance study, giving recommendations for accrual
accounting, performance budgeting and management information sys-
tems, together with proposed staffing requirements for the financial
functions.
2.15    Consultancies to be undertaken as part of the project and financed
under the credit will comprise: (i) assistance in the full implementation of
the accounting systems (para 4.26) and (ii) a cost and revenue study for the
sector (para 4.18). The above studies will require an estimated input by
local consultants of 48 man months. Procedures to appoint consuLtants will
be according to IDA guidelines and subject to IDA approval.

2.16    The feasibility studies for the urban and rural low-cost sanitation
component are being done by the Technology Advisory Group (TAG) under the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) funding (para 2.33). The urban
study is already completed and the rural one is expected to be finished by
October 1985. In addition, there wiLl be a small input by the TAG team to
assist in implementation of the low-cost sanitation components (para 2.34);
this input will be financed out of the Credit.
H. Implementation Schedule
2.17    KWWA would implement the project over five years.  The smaller water
supply components are expected to be completed in early 1989 and the two
larger schemes (GCDA and Quilon) in early 1990. The preliminary engineering
is already sufficiently detailed to allow the material and equipment require-
ments to be specified with minimal refinement. Although some detailed design
work would continue throughout the first project year (Action Plan, Annex 8),
preparation of tender documents should be sufficiently well advanced to bid
and award some of the major material and equipment contracts by the second
half of :985. Civil engineering contracts can be awarded shortly thereafter.
The low-cost sanitation components are expected to be completed by early
1990. Annex 9 includes simplified bar charts showing major activicies for all
project components. Project completion is scheduled for March 31, 1990 and
the credit clcsing date for March 31, 1991.
2.18    The scheduled implementation period of five years is judged to be
feasible in view of the following factors:
(a) The project had been scaled back during preappraisal. At appraisal,
preliminary engineering had already been completed in substantial
detail and KWWA staff are currently working on the preparation of
final specifications and bid documents for equipment which involve
long delivery times, so that critical contracts could be awarded at
an early stage;
(b) The technical components and scope of the project are within the
existing experience and competence of KWWA staff; the technical
competence of the staff is well developed, to the extent that con-
sultants were not required for the engineering feasibility study
work. Operational procedures within the KWWA are established and
proven in practice. Untried or particularly sophisticated technology
has not been incorporated in any of the schemes.
(c) The size of the project is within KWWA's own capacity for implemen-
tation and operation; the project would equal about 30X of COK's
anticipated Seventh Plan investment in the sector, and, by 1990,
would serve about 9% of KWWA's connected users and 7% of its stand-
post users. The buildup of staff required to handle this project and



-18-
other work under the Seventh Plan is in Line with the rate of expan-
sion which KWWA has recently experienced. The consultants who
studied KWWA's organizational structure have specified the recruit-
ment needed for the professional staff. The extensive training
component is oriented to the technical manpower requirements for the
next five years (paras 2.39-2.43).
(d)   The local capacity for construction activity has proven adequate in
other KWWA projects of similar magnitude.
I. Procurement and Contracts
2.19    Equipment and material contracts would be awarded under international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines with the following
exceptions: contracts valued under US$200,000; contracts for concrete and
asbestos cement because of their fragility and high transportation costs.
These items would be procured under local bidding procedures acceptable to
IDA.
2.20    Most civil works would be carried out through a large number of
relatively simple contracts by contractors registered in Kerala or other
parts of India. These works, which are widely dispersed, do not require
speciaL equipment or techniques and are labor intensive; they include water
transmission mains, pumping stations and distribution facilities. Since
foreign bidders could not successfully compete with local bidders for works
of this type and size, these would be subject to local competitive bidding.
The treatment plants will be constructed on a turnkey basis. The value of
the contracts (an average base cost of $295,000 for each plant) is unlikely
to be large enough to attract foreign interest and these will also be bid
locally.
2.21    In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic manufac-
turers would be given a preferential margin equal to 15Z of the c.i.f. of
the competing imports, or the existing rate of customs duty, whichever is
lower. Material and equipment requirements for the project and tentative
contract packages are shown in Annex 10. Irrespective of the pipe materials
and quantities indicated under items la, lb and lc of Annex 10, for pipes of
diameters 400 mm and above, bids will be invited from a range of materials
that includes asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, steel and prestressed
concrete. All bidding packages for materials worth over US$200,000 equiv-
alent, all bids for treatment plant and pumping equipment, and civil works
contracts over US$600,000 equivalent, would be subject to IDA's prior review
of procurement documentation and awards. These would cover about 39% of the
total estimated project costs. In addition, to ensure that contracts are
standardized in a form satisfactory to IDA, the first five bid documents
including both LCB and ICB would be reviewed by IJA. The balance of con-
tracts would be subject to random post review by IDA after contract award.

The consulting services will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for the use of consultants (August 1981). Procurement arrange-
ments are summarized in Table 2.2.

J. Disbursement
2.22    The proceeds of the credit would be fully disbursed over a six and
one-half year period. The project closing date would be scheduled for one
year after the project completion period to allow for repayment of
'retention money' to contractors. A minimal amount of d4sbursement is
expected for the six month period after project completior.. An estimated
disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 11. The proposed amounts of
disbursements of the credit by category are shown in Table 2.3.

TOTAL US$41.0
2.23    No disbursements would be made against administrative costs.  Disbur-
sements for small civil works payments of about Rs 300,000 or less, for
equipment and material payments of about Rs 150,000 or less, and for amounts
disbursed under the house connections Loan fund, would be made against State-
ments of Expenditures (SOE), certified by the Project Director (or other
appropriate officer). Supporting documentation for items disbursed against
SOEs will be retained centrally and made available for IDA for review dn
request. The expenditures disbursed under SOEs will be audited annually by
independent auditors, acceptable to IDA (para 4.29).
2.24    This six and one-half year schedule is about one year shorter than
the Bank disbursement profile for India. It is based an the implementation
schedule which was estimated considering the factors discussed in paras 2.17
and 2.18.
K. Water Sources and Water Rights
2.25    Careful consideration was given by PHED/KWWA to the selection of the
project's water sources. Surface water resources are widely available in
Kerala, but groundwater is generally unreliable and of poor quality (para
1.10). Even in cases where groundwater is available, sample studies for



-21-
groundwater development conducted by PHED have indicated that, whereas the
capital costs would be comparable to those for surface water sources, the
operating costs would be high, making the groundwater alternative uneconomic.
Surface water sources have therefore been selected for all seven of the water
supply schemes. Where feasible alternative surface waLer sources were avail-
abLe, the choice was based on the criteria of least-cost and water quality.
2.26    During appraisal, it was demonstrated that sufficiently reliable
sources are available for all the schemes considered. In five nf the seven
cases, the avaiLability of water will depend on other major impounding
projects (hydro-electric, irrigation or water supply) which are either com-
pleted or will be by the end of 1985. In one of these cases (Quilon), KWWA
needs an allocation from the Irrigation Department. The two remaining
schemes (Adoor and Chithara) will rely on unregulated run-of-river fLows;
consideration of the hydrological data available for these two sources indi-
cates that sufficient yield will be available to provide reasonable long-term
reliability. Details regarding each source are given in Annex 12.
2.27    In order to ensure that the supply requirements are available from
the respective sources throughout the life of the project, Government sanc-
tions and agreements have been promulgated:
(a) to grant the requisite water abstraction rights for each of
the schemes, taking full account of existing abstraction rights;
(b) to ensure that no further abstraction rights be granted (either
upstream or downstream of the intakes) that would prejudice
KWWA's rights of abstraction;
(c) to ensure that the Irrigation Department permit the necessary
allocation to provide the new supply of water required for Quilon.
L. Leak Detection
2.28    KWWA will be required to establish within its organization a unit to
detect and reduce unaccounted for water in the water supply systems. It is
proposed that this unit will form part of the Authority's centralised serv-
ices (para 2.32) and that it will be based initially at KWWA's Headquarters.
In due course, as the extent of the unit's services expand and trained teams
of staff are assembled, the leak detection function can be gradually devolved
to the proposed regional operating centres. The leak detection unit will be
available to undertake surveys on a sector-wide basis, thus covering the
systems operated by the Municipalities as well as the Authority. Assurances
were received at negotiations that KWWA will prepare a leak detection program
for review with IDA by December 31, 1985 and that the leak detection unit be
fully equipped, trained and operational by April 1, 1986 (Action Plan, Annex



-22-
8).  Thereafter, this program will be implemented and its progress reviewed
by IDA at re;gular intervals.
M. Metering and House Connections
2_99   Metering of all individual domestic connections is accepted practice
in Kerala and KWWA proposes to continue this policy under the project, both
to measure usage for better billing and to curtail consumer and system
wastage. Public standposts will not be metered, except to sample water
usage. The levying of flat-rate per capita charges for public supplies is
considered more practical than the regular metering of the standposts. All
non-domestic connections (such as commercial, industrial and institutional)
will be metered.
2.30    The wide-spread use of meters makes it imperative for KWWA to have
good meter repair facilities. Currently about 20% of the meters are not in
working order; there is a meter repair shop in Trivandrum but its capacity is
limited. Under the project, a fully equipped meter repair workshop would be
set up at each of the regional operating centers. In addition to dealing
with KWWA's own meters, a repair service would be available to the
Municipalities at a reasonable charge. Each repair workshop would be
equipped with a meter test bench in addition to all the necessary tools and a
supply of spare parts. The costs of these proposed workshops is included in
the estimates for the project.
2.31    The cost of providing a consumer connection from the distribution
main up to the property line would be included in total project costs and
collected from the consumer as part of the water tariff. This approach
encourages consumers to apply for connections by reducing high initial con-
nection costs. The provision of all pipework and plumbing beyond the
property line would be the responsibility of the consumer; however low-income
households would be assisted in meeting the initial costs of this work, by
the availability of soft loans from a revolving fund to be set up under the
project. During negotiations, it was agreed that maximum loans of Rs 500
would be made available to households with monthly incomes up to Rs 700.
Loans would be repaid, in conjunction with the water bill, in equal monthly
instalments over ten years at an interest rate of 8.75% per annum. Proceeds
from the fund could be used for future connections outside the project area.
In all cases, the meter will remain the property of KWWA, which will impose a
monthly rentaL charge to consumers in order to cover repairs and maintenance.
As far as possible, consumer connections will be made at the time of con-
struction of the distribution main.



-23-
N. Central Services
2.32    As part of the program to strengthen and improve the organization and
management of KWWA, central services will be set up to provide assistance to
the operating units. These services will be based in KWWA Headquarters but
may have subsidiary units in the regions. The services will include:
(a) Regional workshops for routine repair of plant and equipment.
(b) Water quality laboratories in each of the regions.
(c) Meter repair workshops in each of the regions (para 2.30)
(d) A leak detection unit (para 2.28).
(e) General stores at regional centers, stocked with consumables and
spare parts.
Funds have been included in the project zosts for provision of these serv-
ices.
0. Low-Cost Sanitation
2.33    A feasibility study for a low-cost sanitation program in 10 towns in
Kerala has been carried out by the TAG team. The implementation of the
sanitation program for these towns has been included in this project. With
regard to the rural sector, there is currently a general lack of appropriate
low-cost sanitation facilities and GOK desires to make substantial progress
in this area before 1990. A rural low-cost sanitation component has there-
fore been included as part of the project and a provisional cost has been
allowed for this. Assurances were received at negotiations that the scope
and location of these rural schemes will be determined by a feasibility study
(para 2.16) to be carried out by the TAG team, and completed by October, 1985
(Action Plan, Annex 8).
2.34    The local bodies would be responsible for the implementation of the
low-cost sanitation component of the project with KWWA playing an active
supervisory and monitoring role. To attend to these responsibilities
assurances were received at negotiations that a new low-cost sanitation ceLL
be established within the KWWA organisation by August 1, 1985 (Action Plan,
Annex 8). KWWA already possesses the technical expertise and infrastructure
to assist the program and it is proposed that the cell would form part of the
overall project team. There would be merit in enlisting the services of the
Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) in the monitoring effort. As
well as monitoring the progress of the low-cost sanitation project, this body
could assist in coordinating and promoting related project activities. To
help the low-cost sanitation cell in its responsibilities during implementa-
tion, the advisory assistance of the TAG team would be-obtained for



-24-
approximately 6 man-months input, on an intermittent basis (para 2.16).
Suitable provision has been included to cover the technical assistance for
this project component. The responsibilities of KWWA in monitoring this
program would include the training and licensing of small contractors to
carry out the installation work; provision for this has been made in the
training component of the project.
2.35    GOK would fund the low-cost sanitation components with a 50Z-S0Z loan
grant mix for urban and 25Z-75Z mix for rural schemes. The loans would be
made to the locaL bodies on terms similar to those for the rest of the
project (para 4.08). The full funds would be made available to the local
bodies for implementation and the finished works turned over to the
householders. During negotiations, assurances were received that the local
bodies would be responsible for the cost recovery from the householders on
terms that are consistent with the TAG report 11.
2.36    Regulation is needed for the construction of low-cost sanitation
units and the locating of such units in order to limit pollution. The pass-
ing of by-laws satisfactory to IDA, and based on the model included in the
UNDP Global Project feasibility report, would be required as a condition of
disbursement of funds for each participating town included in this component
of the project (para 6.02).
2.37    Present and proposed sanitation service levels in towns included in
the low-cost sanitation program are shown in Annex 13.
P. Public Health Education
2.38    Potential benefits from the project will be maximized if accompanied
by a comprehensive public health education program to improve sanitary habits
and to encourage the use of the facilities provided. Traditionally, public
health education has been the responsibility of government public health
departments. Recently, bilateral donors, United Nations agencies and volun-
tary non-governmental organizations have been active in this field by spon-
soring public health education in Kerala, either directly or through projects
financed by them. There is no public health education component in this
project, but there are public health education components in the current
Dutch and Danish bilateral aid programs for Kerala rural water supply and
1/  A means test would ensure that grants or partial grants would be avail-
able to lower income groups: for households with no utilities (water or
electricity), 75% grant; with one utility, 50% grant; and two utilities,
no grant. Repayment of the loans by households would be over 25 years
including four years of grace at 8.75X interest per annum. Panchayats
would collect as part of general tax and revenue collection.



-25-
KWWA is investigating whether these efforts can be extended for the benefit
of project areas as well.
Q. Manpower and Training
2.39    Systematic in-house training of the technicaL staff is not currently
provided by KWWA. As a component of the project, KWWA would begin to develop
a comprehensive scheme of education and training and to establish training
facilities. The training system to be developed wouLd not be limited to
project-related needs, but should meet sector manpower development require-
ments beyond the project. With respect to low cost sanitation, the training
program would have a practical emphasis and would take account of evaluation
studies to be made on the operation and use of facilities.
2.40    The total staff employed within the water sector of Kerala, in all
categories is about 5500; this includes municipalities currently operating
their own water distribution systems and work-charged staff. Manpower
projections for the remainder of the Decade, based on sector development
targets and the Organization and Management Study, indicate an annual average
recruitment rate of about 440 staff members per year. This includes the
staff required for the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of
the sub-projects covered by the project. Although substantial, the project
training component would be unable to address the full training needs of the
large, diverse, and widely dispersed work force. It would therefore be
designed as the first phase of a long term training strategy for the whole
sector.
2.41    InitiaLly, training priority would be given to: needs arising from
institutional reorganization; the introduction of new management, financial,
and central support services; and the upgrading of operation and maintenance
skills. The component would include a Stage I preparatory phase, a Stage II
training implementation program and a training evaluation mechanism.
Assurances were received at negotiations that Stage I will commence by
January, 1986 and be completed within twelve months. Invitations to consult-
ants to submit proposals for Stage II would not be extended until a KWWA
Training Steering Committee has confirmed the satisfactory completion of
Stage I. The timing of Stage II would be agreed later with KWWA (Action
Plan, Annnex 8). It is intended that this sector training plan would be
developed and executed in cooperation with the training systems currently
being developed and operated by other State Water Agencies.
2.42    The capitaL and start-up costs of the sector training scheme would be
met by a 100X grant from GOK. Operating costs would be met by KWWA which
will pro-rate appropriate charges to local bodies benefitting from the train-
ing scheme. Any shortfall in operating costs would be covered by GOK.
2.43    The total cost of the training component is estimated at US$773,000
of which about US$100,000 would represent foreign exchange.



-26-
R. Land Acquisition
2.44    Land to be acquired for project purposes has been assessed and the
estimated cost has been included in the project costs. Purchase of private
land would be required for the sites of service reservoirs, pumping stations
and treatment works; pipelines sited alongside roads would not require land
acquisition, while those across private land may do so. KWWA is starting the
necessary planning and legal negotiations for land purchase and during nego-
tiations provided a firm timetable for land acquisition, particularly with
regard to those lands for works to be executed in the first half of the
project period.  Not much land would be required during the first year of
implementation.  As part of its new organizational structure, KWWA is con-
sidering setting up a small land acquisition cell in each of the three
regions in order to expedite the processes for obtaining the land.
III. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. The Kerala Water and Wastewater Authority
3.01    GOK has already promulgated the Kerala Water and Wastewater Authority
Ordinance, which defines the powers of KWWA. The Ordinance empowers KWWA to
operate and maintain all production systems as well as all distribution
systems except in the ten Kerala municipalities which operate their own
distribution systems and will continue to do so (para 1.20). However, under
the provisions of the Ordinance, after three years, or at such time there-
after as GOK may specify, KWWA may be assigned responsibility for these
systems as well.
3.02    Although the Ordinance establishing KWWA has the power of law, its
provisions cannot be regarded as permanent since, if the Ordinance is not
re-confirmed at the statutory six month intervals, it would automatically
lapse. Therefore, assurances were received at negotiations that GOK shall
provid.e the necessary legal cover to maintain YWWA's legal status, powers and
fun.cions substantively as vested in it by virtue of the ordinance.
3.03    KWWA is managed by a Board of Directors, the Chairman of which is the
State Minister responsible for the water supply and sanitation sector. The
Managing Director, a qualified full-time public health engineer nominated by
the Government, acts as its Chief Executive. The remainder of the Board
comprises three ex-officio members who are the secretaries to the State
departments for finance, local administration and public health engineering,
together with two individuals nominated by the Government.



-27-
B.  Implementing Responsibility and Ownership of Assets
3.04    KWWA would be the implementing agency for the proposed project except
for the low-cost sanitation components which will be implemented by the local
bodies. COK wouLd make funds available to KWWA and to the local bodies for
the execution of sub-projects. Ownership of all works constructed under the
project, with the exception of those relating to the Quilon municipality and
the low-cost sanitation components, would vest with KWWA. In the case of
Quilon, all assets created under the project would be handed over to the
Quilon Municipality after completion.
3.05    KWWA would be responsible for repaying to GOK all debts associated
with the project on the basis of an agreed financing plan. Quilon
Municipality and the local bodies benefitting from the low-cost sanitation
component would be responsible for repaying their associated debts to COK.
C. Operation and Maintenance
3.06    Those works within the present jurisdiction of KWWA will continue to
be operated and maintained by KWWA. Following current arrangements, KWWA
will operate and maintain the production and transmission facilities of the
ten municipalities (including Quilon), while the municipalities themselves
will continue to operate their own distribution systems. Except for Cochin,
which is charged a bulk supply rate, KWWA will be reimbursed by the ten
municipalities for KWWA's operation and maintenance expenditures with respect
to their production facilities plus an administrative charge.
D. Organizational Structure of KWWA
3.07    The present organizational structure of KWWA is shown in Annex 14.
Three Chief Engineers, responsible for General and Planning, Rural Water
Supply and Urban Water Supply, report to the Managing Director. As part of
project preparation, consultants were appointed to study the organizational
structure, staffing, systems and procedures needed for the new Authority to
meet its wider responsibilities. Their recommendations include specific
proposals for improvements in the organizational plan, staffing pattern,
delegation of powers, material systems, project planning and control systems.
The consultants considered several different forms of organizational struc-
ture for KWWA and finally recommended a structure based on three operational
regions supported by a strong Planning and Services division based at head-
quarters. This framework would provide for a considerable degree of
decentralization of the functional aspects of KWWA, under the guidance of
four Chief Engineers who would report direct to the Managing Director.
3.08    The appraisal mission reviewed these recommendations and supported
them, subject to some qualifications. The more important of these are as
follows:



-28-
(a) The upgrading of the status of the senior Financial Officer and his
staff commensurate with their important functions in a major retailing
organization.
(b) The creation of a unit to manage, monitor and report on the
project (para 3.09).
It was confirmed during negotiations that a proposed organizational struc-
ture, which takes into account the recommendations of the report and the
above modifications, has been agreed by COK. An outline of this structure is
shown in Annex 15. Assurances were received at negotiations that the four
posts of Chief Engineer and one post of Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts
Officer will be sanctioned and filled by August 1, 1985.
E. Project Management
3.09    KWWA will establish a Project Management Unit to impLement the
project. The Unit would comprise a sm,ll team based at KWWA headquarters,
which would coordinate all aspects of the work by managing, monitoring and
reporting on the project. Design and construction supervision would remain
at the regional or headquarters division level with the Unit maintaining
overall responsibility for the project's procurement and implementation. This
arrangement would provide for effective control of the project, while avoid-
ing the unnecessary disruption which would be caused to KWWA's organization
by the creation of a large special design and supervision team. On completion
of the project, KWWA could continue operation of the Unit for similar large
projects.
3.10    At negotiations, assurances were received that KWWA will fully staff
the unit by August 1, 1985 (Action Plan, Annex 8). To achieve effective
design and implementation, KWWA will maintain the same key personnel in the
Unit to the maximum extent possible. In view of the magnitude of the works
included in the project, and its size in relation to the overall investment
program of KWWA for the remainder of the decade, assurances were received at
negotiations that KWWA will appoint a senior engineer, preferably of a rank
of at least Deputy Chief Engineer, to head the Project Management Unit by
August 1, 1985.
3.11    At appraisal, preliminary engineering had been compLeted in suffi-
cient detail to permit detailed design to proceed immediately. However, a
concerted effort will have to be made by KWWA to achieve design targets on
time and the design sections for the project, headed by suitably qualified
engineers. KWWA confirmed during negotiations that the design cell was in
place and that designs would be completed on time.



-29-
F. Financial and Accounting Systems in KWWA and Quilon Municipality
3.12    Consultants have prepared detailed recommendations for systems of
accrual accounting, performance budgeting and management information for
KWWA.  They have also recommended staffing requirements at the divisional
level for accounting, billing and collection activities. Their recommenda-
tions would serve to maximize the use of present staff in the divisions.
KWWA intends to implement these recommendations, including the appointment of
suitably qualified financial staff to all corporate and divisional posts. It
was confirmed during negotiations that the post of Financial Advisor and
Chief Accounts Officer will be sanctioned and filled by August 1, 1985 and
that consultant support will be provided over 2-1/2 years starting December
1, 1985, to assist in the full implementation of the financial accounting
systems.
3.13    Quilon Municipality will retain ownership of its water supply assets
and operation of its distribution system. In order for it to properly
monitor its financial performance, Quilon Municipality has adopted a resolu-
tion to set up a separate cell for reporting its water and sewerage finances
by August 1, 1985 (Action Plan, Annex 8). The cell will keep accounting and
financial records in the accrual format similar to that being implemented by
KWWA and would report on its activities separately from the other operations
of this municipality. The consultants will assist the Municipality in set-
ting up the separate reporting and accounting cell.
G. Progress Reporting and Supervision
3.14    The Project Management Unit (PMU) to be established in KWWA will be
responsible for reporting progress to IDA on various physical, financial,
technical and institutional aspects of the project on a quarterly basis.
Suggested project monitoring indicators are included in Annex 16. Assurances
were received at negotiations that a specific progress report format satis-
factory to IDA will be developed by August 1, 1985 and that quarterly
progress reports will be submitted to IDA, starting with the quarter ending
December 31, 1985 (Action Plan, Annex 8). It is estimated that about 75
staff-weeks of IDA field supervision will be required during implementation,
with more effort being made during initial years of the project.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. The Project and Sector Investments
4.01    The project forms part of GOK's investment program during the Seventh
Plan (1985-90). The Seventh Plan figures are tentative at this point, but
sector investments are estimated to be Rs 2,750 million; this is about twice
the size of the Sixth Plan sector investments in current terms and is about
50Z larger in real terms. Based on the preliminary figures for the Seventh
Plan, the proposed project would represent about one-third of the sector's
investment program. The Table 4.1 summarizes the Sixth Plan, estimated
Seventh Plan and the proposed project's sector investments.
Table 4.1: KERALA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR -

= 31.4% of
Estimated Seventh
Plan
* Central Services have not been added.
** Estimated figures for the Seventh Plan are those provided by KWWA and
are subject to finalization.
4.02   Although the Seventh Plan's sectoral allocation would be sig-
nificantly larger than its predecessor, the increase is estimated to be
similar to the Sixth Plan's increase over the Fifth. KWWA's (then PHED's)
actual work program during the Sixth Plan was inflated by an emergency works
program, costing Rs 220 millions; this was instituted during Kerala's drought
period in the early 80's and was funded directly by GOI. Including this
program, the Seventh Plan estimates for the sector represent only about a 26%
increase, in real terms, over the Sixth Plan.



-31-
B. Financial Objectives and Cost Recovery
4.03    KWWA is responsible for achieving long-term financial viability in
the water and sanitation sector. The subsidies currently given by GOK to the
sector in the form of capital grants (para 4.08) will need to be continued in
the near-term to provide affordable levels of service to consumers. The
project is mainly a rural one and the 75% grant element to rural schemes is
below the 90% level provided by many other state governments in India.
However, given this large grant element and the reduced debt service, it is
reasonable to expect a high degree of cost recovery through consumer charges
to cover operating costs, the reduced debt service and, if possible, to
generate a rate of return. The paragraphs below relate to project cost
recovery by KWWA in water supply components. For low-cost sanitation (para
2.35), the local bodies would be responsible for cost recovery from the
consumers on terms consistent with the TAG recommendations (para 2.35).
4.04    Cost recovery targets for water supply in the subproject areas are
summarized in Table 4.2; they have been thoroughly discussed with KWWA and
GOK. The targets are designed for KWWA to recover from the date of commis-
sioning the cost of operation, maintenance and overhead. Within the context
of affordability limits for tariffs, the largest portion of debt service will
also be recovered and, where feasible, a positive rate of return will be
generated by the subprojects over time. Consultants, hired by KWWA, have
made socio-economic and financial studies to analyze the threshold of con-
sumer affordability with a view to establishing appropriate water charges
in the project areas. An affordability and 'willingness to pay' limit equal
to 2% of monthly household income has been justified; this same limit has
been found in several other Bank water projects. In Kerala, affordability is
conditioned by the availability of low quality water as an alternative source
and the need to encourage house connections and usage of KWWA's service by
commercial and industrial users.
4.05    Unlike other IDA water projects in India, the financial targets can
be stated only from the end of the project implementation period. This is
because in the project areas, except the Quilon Municipality, water systems
are being provided for the first time and there can be no cost recovery until
comissioning. Assurances were received at negotiations that the financial
targets set for 1990 (see Table 4.2) are accepted by GOK. Projections indi-
cate that the later targets could be achieved if tariffs are adjusted for
inflation. Assurances were received at negotiations that tariff increases
will be instituted on a regular basis, as necessary, from 1990. Interim
increase for tariffs in the Quilon Municipality and areas under KWWA juris-
diction and fcr the Cochin bulk rate (paras 4.23 - 4.24) wouLd be introduced
before December 31, 1987 (Action Plan Annex 8). In those areas where the
municipalities and local bodies own the existing water system, KWWA is
required by its ordinance to charge the full costs of its operation, main-
tenance and overhead for the production and distribution systems.



-32-
4.06    Setting specific targets for 1990 are needed to establish the finan-
cial principle for the project's cost recovery. A cost and revenue study, to
be initiated in 1987 (para 4.18), will review KWWA's costs and it is recog-
nized that the targets might have to be somewhat modified in light of the
study. Cross-subsidy within the sub-project areas is achieved by the dif-
ferential rate structure among domestic and commercial and industrial users
and the graduated tariff scale for the domestic users. Since most of the
project is directed to the rural areas, realistic cost recovery targets in
these areas must recognize the lack of cross-subsidy from industrial users
and the fact that over one-half of the beneficiaries at commissioning would
be standpost users. The tentative tariff structure throughout the project
area (Table 4.4) is kept within a narrow range largely because, according to
affordability limits, the financiaL targets vary for the sub-project areas
and because COK allows a larger grant element (para 4.08) in the capital
financing of rural (as opposed to urban) projects.
4.07    By the mid-nineties, the stable rural areas should be covering a
majority of their debt service, and the developing rural areas, as well as
the urban area, should be generating positive rates of return. All the water
supply assets in the project rural areas, and a bulk of the assets in Quilon,
will be new under the project and thus valued at the current price levels
prevailing during project implementation. The value of existing assets in
the Quilon Municipality have been estimated but there may be some modifica-
tion when consultants evaluate the fixed asset accounts for KWWA and the
Quilon Municipality (para 4.26). If the Rates of Return indicated in the
Financial Targets for later years are achieved, there is also projected to be
sufficient cash flow to cover all operating and maintenance costs plus debt
service. Given the rural nature of the project, the targets would represent
a very positive step toward cost recovery goals in the Indian water supply
sector.

* For the Kottayam and Panchayats in Rural Stable Areas, works will be
conmissioned in March 1989, and the financial targets isply starting from
FY1989/90. For Quilon Municipality and Quilon and GCDA Panchayats, works
wiLl be commissioned in March 1990, and the financial targets apply from
FY1990/91.
*  In Kottayam Panchayats, it will be difficult to meet the initial targets
due to high O&M costs, but it is expected that the staL:d financial
targets can be achieved by 1996. Note: Rate of Return is defined as the
Net Revenue (after covering operating, maintenance, ove-head costs and
depreciation) divided by Average Net Fixed Assets (ANFA).
C. Financing Plan and Project Funding
4.08    GOK has agreed to finance the proposed project on its usual
loan-grant mix of 25Z-75 for rural schemes, 50Z-50Z for urban schemes and
O-lOOZ for central services. Given the economic analysis of project design
(para 5.11) and Kerala's relatively low population growth, the water supply
schemes have been designed so that no further capital investment would be
required in project areas until 2001. Th2 grant amount represents about 7OZ
of project financing due to the preponderance of rural schemes. As mentioned



-34-
(para 4.03), the GOK funding pattern for rural investments has higher loan
and lower grant amounts than is found in many Indian states. Provision has
already been assured by GOK for the proisct's grait and loan funding in the
State's Seventh Plan.

4.10    The proposed credit of US$41 million would be passed on by GOI to GOK
in standard center-to-state arrangements. COK would make available to KWWA,
the Quilon Municipality and to the local bodies (for the low-cost sanitation
work) all funds required by the project, including the proceeds of the IDA
credit in a combination of loans and grants (para 4.08). The terms of GOK
loan would be at 8.75% annual rate of interest to be amortized over 25 years
on equal annual payments to GOK. There would be a five-year grace period for
principal and interest payments, during which time the interest due will be
capitalized and added to the principal loan amount.
4.11    The interest rate is equivalent to that currently charged by the Life
Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) when financing projects of a similar
type. This rate is expected to be positive in real terms for the forseeable



-35-
future since India's average annuaL inflation rate is estimated by the Bank
to range between 6% and 8% over the project period. KWWA would be respon-
sible for repayment of all project loans except those associated with the
capital costs for the Quilon Municipality and for the low-cost sanitation
components.
4.12    Beneficiary local bodies outside the jurisdirtion of KWWA have
adopted resolutions agreeing to participate in the  ;uject and to conform to
the associated financial, operational and institutional requirements.
E. Guarantee of Payments to KWWA
4.13    Until FY90, KWWA is expected to have insufficient cash resources to
service its total existing debt from GOK and LIC (para 4.33). Given the
current water tariff structure, the billable charges to connected private
users are insufficient to cover the total amount for KWWA's operating, main-
tenance, overhead costs plus debt service.
4.14    At present, KWWA also bills the municipalities and local bodies which
own their own water systems for its cost of production/distribution and
overhead expenses; charges Cochin a bulk supply rate; and bills local bodies
within its jurisdiction for the usage of public standpost water. The record
of payment for all these charges has been poor.
4.15    Assurances were received during negotiations that GOK would guarantee
any shortfall in KWWA revenues to cover its operating, maintenance, overhead
and debt service costs, until the beginning of FY90 (Action Plan, Annex 8),
when the cost and revenue study recommendations should be implemented (para
4.21).
F. Tariffs
4.16    A tentative tariff structure for connected users (1990 prices), has
been estimated to meet cost recovery targets (para 4.06) at commissioning
of the project. These tariff rates are within the limit of affordability (2%
of average household income) established by the socio-economic surveys l/.
It is assumed that there would be graduated tariff slabs for domestic con-
sumption; the first slab, representing basic household needs of up to 5000
1/ Affordability calculations for future years have been based on estimated
increases in income levels and in general price levels.

liters per month, would be priced at the lowest rate of Rs 1.00 per 1000
liters 1/.   The estimates of 1990 tariffs, over the project areas are shown
in Table 4.4 below.

Commercial users:                               2.00-2.50
Industrial users:                               3.00
/a   These tariffs are in line with other states' tariffs inflated to
1990 prices. The recent Tamil Nadu Project (Cr. 1435/SF16-IN)
indicates that the urban tariffs at commissioning in 1988-89 will
be from Rs 1.35-1.90 per 1000 liters.
4.17    In Quilon, there is currently a water tax established at 4% of annual
Rental Value. It is expected that this will continue to generate sufficient
funds to pay for public standpost supply. In non-urban project areas, where
there is now effectively no water tax, the financial analysis indicates that
the cost of standpost water would be about Rs 1 per capita per month. This
amount would be raised by the local bodies (Panchayats) from general revenues
21.
1/ No domestic free allowance is envisaged but a minimum charge could be
levied against the first 5000 liters per month.
2/ Current legislation limits Panchayat direct collections for water serv-
ices to a maximum of 12 1/2% of total annual Panchayat revenue from all
internally generated resources. Any additional revenue required for
standpost supply is provided as a subvention by GOK.

C.  Cost and Revenue Study
4.18    KWWA is now implementing a commercial accounting system which will
allow better analysis of its cost of operations and its financial status.
Also, over the next five years, KWWA may take over the distribution systems
of the ten municipalities. It would therefore be appropriate to reconfirm
the estimated tariff structure, based on the cost recovery targets, when
better financial information is available, when there is a more precise
picture of KWWA's future responsibilities and when it is closer to project
commissioning. As part of the project, a state-wide cost and revenue study
for water supply will be initiated by December, 1987 (Action Plan, Annex 8).
As well as evaluating the actual tariffs for the project area, this study
would provide the factual basis for development of a structure for water
supply tariffs and charges throughout the State (including rates for bulk
supply, public standposts and private, commercial and industrial consumers).
When the costs of the sewerage system are better established through the new
accounting system, KWWA will examine the issue of sewerage charges
separately.
4.19    The study is expected to take 12 months to complete.  Terms of
reference for the study were reviewed and agreed with IDA at negotiations.
4.20    Future tariff policy must essentially address the entire sector and
not confine its attention to the limited project areas. Project area finan-
ces simply form a part of the Authority's financial picture. The cost
recovery targets that have been defined above for the project area may be
equally appropriate for the sector as a whole, particularly as GOK's grant
policy has been similar throughout the sector.
4.21    During negotiations, assurances were received that COK and KWWA will
review the cost and revenue study with IDA and establish an equitable,
statewide structure for tariffs no later than April 1, 1990 1/. Under its
ordinance, KUWA must charge the municipalities and local bodies, which own
their own systems, the current rates for KWWA's operation, maintenance and
overhead costs for their systems. Assurances were also received that GOK
will implement the new tariffs, based on the cost and revenue study recommen-
dations, for all those systems in operation at the time and for other systems
as they are commissioned (Action Plan, Annex 8). The tariffs and charges
would then be reviewed and revised on a regular basis, as necessary, in order
to adjust for inflation and other factors (Action Plan, Annex 8).
1/ In the case of project areas where new water systems will be commissioned
by March 1989, new tariffs will be introduced from April 1, 1989.



-38-
H. Interim Tariff
4.22    Tariffs in Trivandrum and several other areas were raised in 1984,
but will need to be raised again before project commissioning in order for
revenues to cover direct operating costs and debt service. Tariff analysis,
geared to the cost recovery targets defined above (para 4.06), indicates that
future tariffs for planned systems will have to be substantially increased
from existing levels to obtain a reasonable degree of financial viability in
the sector. To meet inflation alone, there is justification for a gradual
increase in tariffs on a regular basis. To phase in present tariff levels
with those proposed at the end of the decade, and to alleviate the need for
any operating subsidy by COK, tariffs throughout the sector should be raised
in the intervening period, before the introduction of new tariffs and charges
based on consideration of the cost and revenue study.
4.23    Within the project areas, only Quilon Municipality will have a water
supply system in operation before FY90. At negotiations, assurances were
received that Quilon Municipality would raise the current average tariff of
Rs 0.40/1000 liters by 50% for domestic usage, and correspondingly for com-
mercial and industrial usage, by December 31, 1987.
4.24    In areas under the ownership of KWWA, current tariffs are about Rs
0.5011000 litres for domestic usage. Assurances were given during nego-
tiations that KWWA will increase the present levels of water rates by 20%
for domestic, commercial and industrial usage by December 31, 1987. Based on
current service, KWWA estimates that such an increase would be sufficient to
cover all its operating, maintenance and overhead costs. Local bodies out-
side the jurisdiction of KWWA would be expected to continue to reimburse KWWA
for the full charge of operation, maintenance and overhead costs of their
production and/or distribution facilities. Failure on the part of these
local bodies to pay these costs would constitute a legitimate reason for GOK,
in keeping with the terms of the Ordinance, to request KWWA to assume full
responsibility for operating these systems. Cochin Corporation, which cur-
rently pays Rs 0.20/1000 liters to KWWA for its treated bulk water supply,
would be expected to pay a bulk supply rate adequate to cover KWWA's operat-
ing expenditures.  Assurances were received at negotiations that KWWA will
implement an interim increase in the Cochin bulk supply rate to a minimum of
Rs 0.25/1000 liters by December 31, 1987.
I. Billing and Collection Performance
4.25    Up until now, billing and collection of water charges from private
connections have not been stressed by KWWA and the records appear to be
incomplete. Meter readings are done monthly but billings are done in a more
sporadic fashion and collections represent only about 70% of what is billed.
About 20% of the meters are not in working order. During appraisal, the IDA
mission emphasized that in building the financial side of its organization,
KWWA must give particular and immediate attention to biLling and collections.
With the new accounting system, it will become easier to measure the



-39-
efficiency of the effort. ConsuLtants have already recommended the staffing,
procedures and bookkeeping required to achieve acceptable billing and collec-
tion rates. At negotiations, assurances were received that the following
billing and collection targets will be achieved in the medium term: by the
end of FY87, 80% billing of accounts and 80% collection of billings; and by
the end of FY88, 95Z billing of accounts and 90% collection of billings.
J. Accounts, Audits and Submission of Financial Statements
4.26    Consultants have designed accruai accounting, financial control and
management information systems for KWWA and are also responsible for their
preLiminary implementation.   Finances of area schemes would be identifiable
as categories under the regional division finances. The systems were
reviewed by the appraisal mission and were found to be adequate for recording
and reporting all project related financial transactions. The thorough
introduction and instruction process for the new systems is proving more time
consuming than originally anticipated. To promote the full initiation of
staff in the new accounting, assurances were received at negotiations that
KWWA will retain the services of the consultants over a two and one-half year
period, commencing on December 1, 1985 (Action Plan, Annex 8). The systems
should be sufficiently operable to record project expenditures, which are
expectea to start in late 1985. Terms of Reference (TOR) for the consultancy
were confirmed with IDA at negotiations. The TOR would cover the following
activities: (i) assistance in implementing KWWA's new financial systems and
modifying them as found advisable for practical use; (ii) staff training at
all levels; (iii) preparation of the first year's financial statements (FY87)
and IDA progress reports and guidance with the preparation of the second
year's statements and reports (FY88); (iv) valuation and preparation of
ICWWA's fixed asset account on a scheme-wise basis. The consultants would
also assist Quilon Municipality officers to: set up and train the Quilon
reporting cell; implement Quilon's accrual accounting systems; assist with
preparation of statements (FY87 and FY88) and IDA progress reports; value the
KWWA and Qui lon Municipality's water and sanitation sector fixed assets.  The
minimum consultancy input anticipated for this assignment is about 18
man-months over the two and one-half year period. Funds for consultancy fees
have been included in the project costs.
4.27    The Authority's accounts will be audited by independent commercial
auditors, acceptable to IDA. The financial statements will include balance
sheets, income statements and funds flow statements. The first year to be
audited under the new accrual accounting system is FY87. KWWA audit reports,
as well as the Quilon and low-cost sanitation audit reports discussed below,
will be submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of each fiscal year,
starting with FY87.
4.28    Under its SLA, Quilon Municipality is required to keep commercial
accounts for its water and sanitation operations separate from its other
municipal accounting. These accounts, as well as project accounts similar to
those required of the Authority as a whole, may be audited by independent



-40-
commercial accountants acceptable to IDA or by the Commercial Wing of the
Kerala Accountant General's Office.  For the low-cost sanitation
sub-projects, the collective project expenditure and cost recovery accounts
will be maintained by the Department of Local Administration; the local
bodies would be responsible for cost recovery from the households.  The
Examiner of Local Fund Audits will audit these reports.
4.29    In addition to the above audit requirements, the independent auditors
acceptable to IDA are required to certify that all funds provided KWWA by
GOK, through the proposed IDA credit, have been used for the projects iden-
tified. When IDA reimbursements are requested through Statements of Expendi-
ture, the auditors are required to certify that underlying files and data
fully support the requests for disbursements.
4.30    Assurances were received at negotiations that all the above audit
requirements will be met by KWWA, GOK and Quilon Municipality.
K. Financial Projections for the Project Areas and KWWA
4.31    PHED, now KWWA, has kept their accounts on a simple cash basis and
the present records are insufficient and difficult to analyze. As part of
the preparation for this project, KWWA engaged consultants to set up and help
institute an accrual accounting system for the Authority as a whole. Consult-
ants were also contracted to do separate financial forecasts for each
sub-project area incorporating the results of their tariff studies. Based on
this work and the tentative tariff structure, financial projections have been
made for the project areas (FY91-FY2000) and are shown in Annex 18; projec-
tions have also been made for the Authority as a whole and are shown in Annex
19. Assumptions for the Financial Projections are indicated in Annex 17.
4.32    A summary of the project's financial projections is shown in
Table 4.5. These results conform to the project targets (Table 4.2): from
FY91, the urban and rural developing areas (except for Kottayam in the ini-
tial years) cover all operating, maintenance and debt service costs, and from
FY97 they generate Rates of Return of about 1.5X to 3.5%; the rural stable
areas from FY90 cover all operating maintenance and overhead costs and by
FY97 meet about 60X of their debt service requirements. The sub-project
areas (with rural stable areas grouped as one sub-prcject) were analyzed
separately to effectively analyze cost recovery and to ensure the financial
viability of the project investments.

4.33    The opening KWWA accrual accounts have been estimated by consultants.
Based on these, projections have been made for KWWA from FY86-FY95. Through
FY89, an average uniform tariff is assumed, similar to what exists now in the
State of Rs 0.50 per 1000 liters. From FY90, the tariffs assumed are the
ones tentatively estimated for the project. A summary of KWWA's financial
projections is shown in Table 4.6. The need for a tariff revision is
apparent from the statements. Until FY90, an annual revenue grant (of up to
about Rs 85 million in FY89) will be required from GOK for KWWA to cover the
total of its operating and maintenance expenses, interest payments and repay-
ment of principal. From FY90, due to the proposed tariff restructuring,
sufficient cash would be generated to cover all operating costs and debt
service obligations and to generate Rates of Return on Net Fixed Assets of
about 2%. If an interim tariff increase at the uniform level of Rs 0.60 per
1000 liters is implemented in FY88, the need for revenue grants is minimized
to about Rs 32 million total in FY89 and FY90. There is the possibility that
by 1990 the Authority will take over the ownership of existing water supply
systems owned by the municipalities and local bodies. Projections incor-
porating this possibility for the ten large municipalities have been made for
the Authority from FY91- FY95 (these projections are available in the Project
File) and they indicate that the Authority's overall financial position would
be marginally improved by the takeover.
L. Insurance
4.34    Assurances were received at negotiations that GOK would cover project
property loss and damage risks througb self-insurance and would provide funds
for any losses which might occur.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Least-Cost Solution and Evaluation of Alternatives
5.01    KWWA's engineering department examined all feasible engineering
alternatives for development of water sources and transmission of water in
the project areas. To arrive at least-cost solutions, an analysis of capi-
tal, operating and maintenance costs was done on a discounted cash flow basis
with a 9% discount rate. Consideration was given to deferring capital expen-
ditures by phasing key components including pumpsets, treatment plants and
service reservoirs.  The selection of  iater sources was based on least-cost
criteria and reliability of flow (para 2.25-2.27).
5.02    If a useful life for the project's assets cf 30 years is assumed, it
is estimated to provide about 36 million person years of residential service.
Approximately 59% of the tot-l volume would be consumed by residential cus-
tomers; the remaining 41% would be consumed by commerce, industry and public
institutions. The present value of project costs per person year of service



-44-
is Rs 22 in Quilon, Rs 19 in the rural developing areas and Rs 11 in the
rural stable areas. If the costs of the project are allocated between
residential and non-residential users in proportion to the volumes of
projected demand, the per capita costs for residential users are Rs 16, 11
and 5 per year for the Quilon Municipality, rural developing areas and rural
stable areas, respectively. (All calculations are in FY91 prices with a 9%
discount rate).
B.  Marginal Cost Analysis
5.03    The long-term marginal cost for water has been estimated using the
average incremental cost (AIC). Price distortions are judged to be of minor
significance except for wages paid to unskilled labor. The wage bill for
unskilled workers represents slightly over 2% of the present value of project
costs; and therefore shadow prices were not applied. All calculations refer
to constant FY91 prices. Table 5.1 below indicates the AIC per 1,000 liters,
for each sub-project, at a 9% discount rate calculated over a project life of
40 years.
Table 5.1: AVERAGE INCREMENTAL COST PER 1,000 LITERS
-  Rural Stable Areas         Rs 2.61
-  Rural Developing Areas    Rs 2.71
-  Urban                      Rs 2.46
WEIGHTED AVERAGE    Rs 2.61*
* The AIC is sensitive to the assumed discount rate.
At an 8% discount rate, the weighted average for the
AIC would be Rs 2.39/1,000.
5.04    The tentative tariff (in Rs/l,000) for domestic slab rates is about
Rs 1.00-2.00/m3; for commercial, Rs 2.25-2.501m3; and for industrial, Rs
3.00/m3. These rates are limited by households' ability to pay and the need
to discourage consumers from using alternative water sources which are pol-
luted. Thus, the AIC is reasonably related to the tentative tariff struc-
ture: industrial and commercial users would pay rates which approximate the
average incremental costs; rural domestic users who dominate the project,
would pay about 60% of the AIC.
C. Rate of Return
5.05    Financial and economic appraisals have been conducted under the
assumption that industrial customers would be charged about Rs 3.00/m3 and
commercial customers Rs 2.50/m3. Progressive tariffs would be applied to
residential customers. The tentative tariff structure will be finalized



-45-
following completion of a cost an' revenue study to be financed under the
project (paras 4.18-4.21). The value of incremental project benefits has
been estimated as the area beneath the demand curve c3rresponding to
incremental consumiption plus the cost savings accruing to consumers as a
consequence of reduced expenditures to obtain preproject supplies. The
details of the calculations are summarized in a working note in the Project
File (Annex 21). Table 5.2 presents the economic rates of return (ERR) for
the three subprojects together with estimates of the impact of changes in the
parameters of the analysis.

D.  Environmental Health Impact
5.06    In the rural areas, where the existing water sources are poor in
quality and in reliability, the impact of the new water supply schemes would
be substantial. The availability of sufficient quantities of good quality
water should lead to a marked reduction in the incidence of water-related
diseases (para 1.09). The urban water supply component in Quilon would
improve present environmental conditions by increasing service levels,
providing more uniform distribution of piped water and meeting the increased
demand due to population growth. The low-cost sanitation components would
make much-needed improvements in the sanitation conditions in the selected
town and rural areas. By promoting an equitable distribution of wholesome
water, and improved disposal of human waste, the project would help reduce
sources of disease which presently pervade both rural and urban communities.



-46-
E. Impact on Poverty Groups
5.07    The poorer groups in the rural areas of the project would benefit
most directly from the provision of public standposts. The design criteria
for the standposts provide for 180 people per tap, which allows the walking
and waiting times for water collection to be reduced. A socio-economic study
for the project area reported that households currently spend an average of
one hour 40 minutes per day in fetching water, often from unsatisfactory
sources. Conditions are worse during the dry season when many sources disap-
pear. The urban water supply component of the project would ensure that
satisfactory service levels (per capita allowance, pressure and supply hours)
are provided at the standposts in Quilon Municipality. The low-cost sanita-
tion components will have a substantial impact on poverty groups, since the
project will provide 100% coverage of the population in the selected com-
munities.
5.08    Identifying the poverty group among beneficiaries is difficult as the
poor in Kerala are geographically dispersed in the project areas. It is
reasonable to assume that the numbers in the poverty groups receiving
benefits will be proportionate to their population within each subproject
area. Components such as low-cost sanitation and the revolving fund for
house connections wiLl benefit a higher proportion of the poverty group. The
rural poverty threshold for Kerala was estimated in 1979 at an annual income
of Rs 550 per capita, which is the equivalent of about Rs. 890 per capita in
1985 prices. On this basis about 78% of project beneficiaries are poor.
These beneficiaries are expected to demand two-thirds of the quantity of
water supplied for residential use. About 47% of project costs (US$40 mil-
lion) will be spent on providng water to the poor. Because of the cross
subsidies imbedded in proposed tariff structures, the poor will pay only
about a quarter of the capital and operating costs of supplying water under
the project.
F. Project Risks
5.09    Because the project is large and extended over a substantial area,
implementation will have to be well coordinated and monitored for the project
to be finished on time. Since KWWA is newly established, there is a risk
that the organization structure may not function compLetely smoothly. For-
tunately, KWWA's technical staff (in its previous role in PHED) has hod
considerable experience in handling projects of similar magnitude and scope.
Also, the organization, management and staffing of KWWA are being
strengthenea (para 3.07-3.08) as part of the project. Along with the Opera-
tional Action Plan (Annex 8), consultants will help design and introduce a
project monitoring system.
5.10    Achieving the project's financial objectives has been a major concern
in most water supply projects. To minimize the risk of failure, realistic
financial targets have been set; the Action Plan has been detailed (Annex 8)
to help improve both cost recovery and operating efficiency; and improved



-47-
financial and accounting systems are being implemented which will help
measure and control KWWA's financial performance. Assurances were received
at negotiations on the implementation of: interim tariffs required to phase
in the 1990 financial targets; a cost and revenue study to recommend
state-wide cost recovery targets (para 4.18); and the application of tariffs
to the entire KWWA service area in 1990. The project seeks the achievement
of financial targets not just in discrete project areas but to assure the
financial viability of KWWA as a whole.
C. Project Justification
5.11    The project is justified by: (a) the physical objectives of meeting
priority needs in the sector; (b) the project's economic and financial rates
of return; and (c) the improvements which can be achieved in the sector's
institutions and policies.
5.12    The main physical objective is the provision of piped water supplies
to rural communities which have no safe supply at present.   About
three-quarters of the project's construction funds will be allocated to this
purpose. More than 80% of the project's rural water supply is for schemes
that faLl into COI's 'problem village' category; sonme 60% of the people in
these villages are below the absolute poverty threshold. The project's
design supply is for about 1.5 million people in rural areas and 190,000
people in the urban area. The urban water supply component of the project
allows rehabilitation and extension of an existing system and also
facilitates provision of supplies to adjacent rural areas. The sanitation
components will promote appropriate low-cost technology in the State and, for
the first time, a program will specifically address rural needs.
5.13    The proposed water supply financial targets for the project have been
set at realistic levels, which result in tariffs that are affordable to
domestic consumers and allow satisfactory ccost recovery for the KWWA; there
would be full coverage of project operating and maintenance cost from commis-
sioning and rates of return would be generated in the subproject rural
developing areas over time and in the urban area from commissioning. All the
subprojects have been designed technically to use least-cost solutions. The
project results in acceptable economic rates of return of between 7 to 14X,
with the industrial and commercial users expected to pay rates which
approximate the average incremental cost.
5.14    The project has a strong institutional and policy emphasis.  It is
expected to strengthen financial managemJent (through full implementation of
the new accounting systems), to improve central services (through meter
repair and leak detection programs) and to develop staff capability (through
a comprehensive training component). Low cost sanitation will be promoted in
rural and urban areas as an alternative to water-borne sewerage. And for the
first time in Kerala, financial accountability will be adopted in the sector.
The project addresses the issue of cost recovery on state-wide basis, by
supporting interim tariff increases in 1987 and a cost and revenue study
which will make recommendations for a 1990 tariff and charge structure for
the whole state including areas outside the project.

KERAIA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT                    Page 1 of 2
Existing and Proposed Service Levels for Water Supply in the Project Area
In most of the rural areas, existing water supplies are drawn
directly from wells. This source is unsatisfactory, since the wells are
subject to contamination and often dry up in the summer months. Although
minor piped water systems have been installed to cover small parts of some
areas, the sources provide a yield which is inadequate and unreliable. In
the subproject area for GCDA, limited piped supplies have been provided to a
part of the population by extensions to the existing system supplying the
Cochin Corporation. Where appropriate, components from existing schemes will
be incorporated into the project's comprehensive scheme. In the rural areas
surrounding Quilon, the predominant reliance on dug wells is supplemented by
some small piped schemes depending on tubewells and on limited supplies drawn
from the existing municipal system.
In the Quilon Municipality, only about 20% of the population cur-
rently receives a piped water supply through house connections; the remainder
rely on standposts or non-piped supplies. The existing system does not meet
the present demands at all times and is inadequate to supply expanding domes-
tic, commercial and industrial requirements. The source of water for the
Quilon scheme is the Sasthamcottah Lake, from which water is abstracted,
treated and pumped through a 26 km pipeline.
Water supply systems exist in all of the ten towns included in the
urban low-cost sanitation component. Wherever possible, the rural areas to
be selected for installation of low-cost sanitation will be restricted to
areas where piped water supply will be already available.
None of the areas which will receive water supplies under the project
has a water-borne sewerage system. Waste disposal for the one urban area,
Quilon, will be taken up under other COK projects. Sanitation is generally
provided in the form of bucket or pit latrines. Similar conditions exist in
the ten towns which are the subject of the low-cost sanitation component.
Proposed Service Levels for Water Supply
The objective of the proposed project is to provide virtually all
consumers in the project area with at least a basic safe domestic supply (30
liters per capita per day) by 1990, and thereafter to increase the proportion
of consumers with direct house connections steadily up to the end of the
project design period in the year 2011. By that time, the net service levels
for house connections would be as follows:
(a) Stable Rural Areas - 40% of the ponulation served would have a house
connection providing 60 lpcd.
(b) Developing Rural Areas - In two of the three subproject areas (Kot-
tayam and Quilon panchayats), 60% of the population served would have



_54_                    ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
a he-use connection providing 60 lpcd. In GCDA the project would
provide the standard of service for urban areas (as described below)
by the end of the project period.
(c) Urban area - 80% of the population would have a house connection
providing 112.5 lpcd.
The remainder of the served populations in both the urban and rural area
would receive 30 lpcd through public standposts.
All the above per capita consumption figures are expressed net of
losses in the system; the net consumptions are based on gross figures less an
allowance of 25% for water wastage. Details of proposed service levels for
the various project components are given in Annex 3. In the urban and
developing areas, between 15% and 25% of total supply is expected to be sold
to industrial and commercial consumers.
The domestic service levels proposed for the project are in line with
current policy appLicable to other schemes in Kerala, and are relatively
modest compared with the guidelines proposed by GOI for urban supplies: 140
lpcd for house connections and 40 lpcd for public standposts.
Population and TotaL Demand Forecasts
Forecasting of future population in the subproject areas has been
based on the 1981 census figures and past population growth rates in the
areas. The forecasts for the project are summarized in Table 1 below.

KERALA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Water Sources for the Sub-Projects
The following summaries outline the position regarding the source of
water for each of the seven schemes. Each abstraction will be covered by
GOK Orders for water rights described in paragraph 3.22.
1.  Puthencruz:  Abstraction for this scheme will-be made from the
Iuvattupuzha River downstream of the major hydro-electric dam at Idduki. The
discharge pattern from this hydro-electric project necessary for its own
operational requirements is such as to ensure that sufficient flow will be
available for the purpose of the Puthencruz scheme.
2. Adoor: Flow records and observations on the Achancoil River indicate
that sufficient surface flow occurs with fair reliability.  This will be
supplemented by sub-surface flow and evidence from similar existing schemes
indicates that this source will have an acceptable long-term reliability for
a rural water supply project.
3. Chithara: The limited hydrological information indi ates that a reliable
yie'd will probably be provided by the relatively small catchioent feeding the
intake. Observation of flow in the river during the 1983 drought would
further support this conclusion. The major reservoir for the Kallada Irriga-
tion Project lies just downstream and it would be possible to take advantage
of the storage provided. A contingency sum has therefore been included in
the cost estimates for additional intake works in the reservoir, which could
be used if shown to be necessary in dry years.
4. Vilappil: Abstraction will be from the Karamana River downstream of the
existing KiWA reservoirs currently supplying water to Trivandrum. The
capacity of these reservoirs has been designed to meet the Trivandrum demand
until the year 2025; the Vilappil requirement is insignificant by comparison.
[WWA will therefore operate the reservoirs to provide for the needs of both
schemes throughout the life of the project.
5.  Kottayam:  The supply will be drawn from Thaneermukam bunded reservoir,
the level of the intake being set beLow the lowest operating level of the
reservoir. Sufficient storage and inflow are available in this reservoir to
provide for all the requirements of the Kottayaw scheme.
6. GCDA: Abstraction for this scheme will be made from the Periyar River,
downstream of the major new muLti-purpose dam being completed at Edamalayar.
The discharge pattern from this dam necessary for the project's own opera-
tional requirements is such as to ensure that sufficient flow will be avail-
able to meet the requirements of the GCDA water supply scheme.
7.  QuiLon:  Abstraction will be from the Sasthamkotta Lake, which provides
the existing supply to the town. To ensure sufficient supplies, EWA are in
the process of reaching an agreement with the Irrigation Department to trans-
fer some 9.3 million m per year to the Lake from the existing irrigation
canal. This entitlement will be sufficient to meet rising demand until about
2002 and, depending on hydrological factors, it wiLl probably fulfill demand
well beyond this date. Should further entitlements be needed at that time,
KWA should negotiate for the rights to the additional water which is avail-
able in the canal.

include the required data in its Quarterly Progress Reports to IDA. In each
case, figures shown for the quarter should be compared to projected figures
or to the corresponding quarter one year earlier. The indicators would apply
to each of the subproject areas, where applicable, and to KWWA as a whole.
Physical Criteria
2. (a) Water Production
i)   average daily production for each month of the quarter;
(b) Water Connections and Metering
i)   number of new connections for the quarter (domestic, stand-

depreciation and interest expenses, to revenues);
(ii)  debt service coverage (ratio of total internal cash generation
to the debt service requirement);
(iii) rate of return for developing rural and urban areas (ratio
of operating income, including depreciation but excluding
interest expense, to net fixed assets in operation);
(iv)  ratio of accounts receivable to total billings.
(b) Billing and Collection (monthly basis)
ti)   average tariff for aLl meters sold;

KERALA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Sunmary of Assumptions for Financial Projections
Financial projections have been preparel for the sub-project areas
from FY 90/91 - FY 99/2000 and for KWWA from FY 85/86 - FY 94/95. For KWWA,
additional estimates were made from FY 90/91 - FY 94/95 in the event that
KWWA takes over the ten municipalities. These Latter statements as well as
detailed financial statement worksheets and assumptions are in the
feasibility studies available in the Project Files.
A. Revenues
Tariffs have been taken at the tentative rate structure projected to
meet project financial targets (para 4.16). KWWA charges to the
municipalities are assumed to equal operation plus maintenance costs plus a
25% overhead fee. The bulk rate charged to Cochin also takes into considera-
tion the capital costs of the production facilities owned by KWWA. Increases
in water rates are assumed to take place every three years to adjust for
inflation (6% per year). Revenues also reflect the expected increase in
water volume production and number of connected users. Sewerage tax income
to K[WA, from outside the project area, is assumed to increase 10% per year,
based on increased connections, and 20% every five years, based on the revi-
sion of annual rental values.
In 1990, bad debt is taken as 20% of domestic billings, 10Z of com-
merciaL and 5Z of industrial; in 1995 the provision goes down to 10% of
domestic billings and 5% of commercial and industrial; standpost revenues
are assumed to oe guaranteed by GOK.
Water wastage is taken to be 25% of total water production in the
project area and 30% in other KWWA systems.
Operating Expenses
Operating and maintenance costs have been analyzed by the consulta.1ts
and KWWA's engineers for FY 1989/90 and are increased, according to produc-
tion, in ensuing years. Inflationary increases are taken at 6% per year
except for power costs which are increased at 9% per year. For sewerage
schemes, operation and maintenance are taken to be 2% of the capital cost of
the schemes. Administrative overhead, other than for billing and collectiors
is considered to be 10% of direct operation and maintenance expenses. Bill-
ing and collection costs are figured on the norms of two meter reading and 2
clerks per 1200 coxinections.

ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 2
Interest on IDA loans is 8.75% per annum, payable over 25 years with
paynents starting in 1990 and all interest during construction capitalized.
For LIC loans, interest is 8.5Z per ennum, payable in 22 years with three
years moratorium.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight Line basis at 2.5% (40
years) of all fixeu assets excluding land and equipment. Equipment is calcu-
lated at 6.7% (15 years).
Balance Sheet
Fixed assets in operation reflect all engineering costs, contingen-
cies and capitalized interest during construction. In the project areas,
except Quilon, all assets are represented by other project investment. In
Quilon, and for other KWWA assets, estimates have been based on COK budgeted
in-vestments and aa approximate depreciation schedule. In 1985, some adjust-
ments may be made to the existing fixed asset accounts, when more precise
evaluations will be done by consultants of the value of these assets as of
KWWA's inauguration in 1984. No other revaluation is reflected.
Wiork-in-progress is calculated according to the construction
schedule. Inventories are estimated at t-'o months of chemicals and main-
tenance requirements, and cash is equal to at least one-half months' operat-
ing and maintenance expenses. Accounts receivable are assumed to be 30% of
net revenues. Accounts payable are estimated at _.,.e month's operating and
maintenance costs.
