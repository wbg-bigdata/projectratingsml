APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND W4ATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SUNMARY ANDM CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the further improvement and
expansion of water supplies in Tunisia for which an IDA Credit of US$10.5
million is proposed. With the help and advice of the Bank, the Tunisian
Government has drawn up a US$58 million National Water Supply Program for
1968-1973, and has set up a national water authority to implement the pro-
gram and provide more effective management of the country's network of
potable water supplies. WIater resources in Tunisia are both inadequate
and located at considerable distances from the main population centers
and principal tourist areas. The urban population is growing twice as
fast as is the overall population, and water consumption and demand are
growing faster than either. A particularly critical field in this sector
is the supply in the tourist areas; tourism has become Tunisia's biggest
foreign exchange earner and a major provider of employment, but its pheno-
menal growth in recent years cannot continue unless adequate water supply
is assured.
ii.       The Bank has already agreed to lend US$15 million (Loan 581-TUN
signed in 1969 ) for the first phase of the National Program, consisting
mainly of major supply works for the most densely populated areas and re-
presenting 49% of the program. The Government of Sweden is lending US$5
million for that first phase jointly with the Bank loan. This report
covers the second phase. The remainder of the National Program is being
financed by the national water authority, Societe Nationale d'Exploitation
et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE), with bilateral aid.
iii.      The proposed project is expected to cost US$19.2 million, or
33% of the cost of the 1968-1973 National Water Supply Program. The pro-
ject consists of eight sub-projects to expand and reinforce the water
supply systems in four regions and four cities of Tunisia which comprise
all the fast-growing major tourist and industrial areas. The project
would be financed by a joint IDA/Swedish Credit of US$14 million, represent-
ing 73% of total project cost. The proposed IDA Credit would be for
US$10.5 million and the Swedish Credit for US$3.5 million.  The joint
Credit would finance all foreign exchange costs, estimated at US$11.3
million, and about one-third of the local costs of works for an amount
of US$2.7 million.
iv.       The project's main features are the construction or reinforce-
ment of water transmission pipelines to supplement the fully-utilized
local water resources of the coastal areas of Tunisia.  Engineering studies
prepared by the water authority were generally adequate.



- ii -
v.        International competitive bidding is to be adopted for all sup-
ply and construction contracts. As in the first project loan, local bid-
ders would enjoy a margin of preference of 15% or customs duty, if less,
in bid comparisons with foreign suppliers.  Disbursements will be divided
between IDA and Sweden on a three-to-one basis.
vi.       The beneficiary of the proposed IDA/Swedish Credits would be
SONEDE. Formed in 1968, this autonomous authority has already, with the
assistance of consultants and advisers, given evidence of improved manage-
ment and operating efficiency.
vii.      The Governnent has already covenanted to contribute US$20.3 mil-
lion equivalent by way of equity towards financing the program.  With the
loans already approved and the proposed credits, however, SONEDE should
be able to finance a major portion of the capital works from its own re-
sources without calling on the full amount to which the Government is
comnitted.  SONEDE's rates were raised in 1968 as a condition of the first
loan, and a further increase, of about 17%, appears necessary in 1973 to
provide a reasonable rate of return on assets employed. There have been
some problems over collection of suns due to SONEDE from the Government
and another public body but these are in process of being resolved.
viii.     Excluding external benefits derived from tourism as well as
from improved health and fire protection, the program of works financed
by the Bank group and Sweden would yield internal rates of return between
11% and 1%.
ix.       The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$10.5 million to be relent to SONEDE with interest at 7%, repayable over
25 years including 5 years' grace period.



TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF THE SB2ONL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. LNTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1966, the Government of Tunisia asked the Bank and the
Government of Sweden, represented by the Swedish International Development
Authority (SIDA), for assistance in financing various water supply works.
A Bank loan (581-TUN) of US$15 million (D 7.8 million) was signed in
1969, together with a Swedish Credit of US$5 million (D 2.6 million), to-
wards financing the most urgently needed works (first project). This
report deals with the next pbase of wiorks (second project) which was not
ready for Bank appraisal at that time.
1.02      The Government's original request for assistance resulted in
a visit by a Bank/Swedish identification mission in November 1966, and
on the missionts advice the Government engaged technical and management
consultants. The technical consultants, Societe Generale des Techniques
Hydro-Agricoles (SOGETHA), drew up a program of works to enable priorities
to be assessed, and this program eventually became the basis of the Govern-
ment's 1968-1973 National Water Program.
1.03      The first project consisted mainly of major supply works for
the most densely populated areas (Tunis and the Sahel region).  The second
project is principally for supply works for fast-growing tourist areas
and cities not covered by the first project, together with some works post-
poned when the first project was considered. Both projects are scheduled
for execution over broadly the same period (1970-1973); together they con-
stitute the bulk of the works required for the National Water Program.
1.04      In the management field, Societe d'Economie et de Mathematiques
Appliquees (SEMà) prepared a plan for reorganizing the structure of urban
water supply management.  The Government followed the recommendation of
SEMA and in 1968 enacted a law setting up an autonomous national water
authority, Societe Nationale dtExploitation et de Distribution des Eaux
(SONEDE) to take over all potable water supplies in Tunisia as from July
1968. SONEDE is the borrower under Loan 581-TUN and would be the bene-
ficiary under the credit now proposed.
1.05      In June 1969 a supervision mission for Loan 581-TUN carried out
a preappraisal of the second project on which preparation work had been
proceeding. This project had included rehabilitation of existing distri-
bution systems, but the findings of a Tourism Projects Department mission
had shown that the high rate of growth of tourism facilities now required
accelerated implementation of additional water supplies in tourist areas.
The supervision mission found that satisfactory progress had been made
in installing the management structure and accounting system devised for
SONEDE by the consultants, but some major gaps persisted in the staffing
of the Engineering Department. The management agreed to give top priority
to this matter.

1.06      An appraisal mission conposed of Messrs. Thys and Wil.liams
visited Tunisia in November and December 1969; it was assisted by Mr. J.H.
Jennings and by Messrs. Willen and Ekengren of SIDA. The mission reviewed
the programn of works prepared for this second project by SCNEDE and its
cOnsultants. After discussions, some sub-projects were scaled down and
the construction of some components rephased.  This report is based on
the mission's findings and on information obtained from the Government,
SONEDE and the consultants.

II. THE SECTOR
2.01      The Republic of Tunisia covers an area of about 16U,000 km2,
about one-third the size of France. It has scant natural resources -
mainly phosphates and a little oil. Manufacturing has developed in the
past 10 years, but agriculture is still the main activity, representing
about one-sixth of total GDP. In recent years tourism has overtaken phos-
phates as the country's major foreign exchange earner. Per capita income
is about US$230. Most of the population and the economie activities are
concentrated in the coastal areas and in the north, the southern part of
the country being almost wholly desert.  In 1969 the economy was disrupted
by a series of floods.
2.02      Of Tunisials estimated population of 4.7 million (196B), about
2.4 million live in the cities and in semi-rural towns with more than
1,000 inhabitants. Some 2.3 million of these urban dwellers, living in
248 centers, have access to a public water supply and only 30 villages
(with a total population of less than 100,000) have no public supply.
However, only 45% of all the consumers in Tunisia have house connections;
the remaining 55% use municipal public taps.
2.03      Between 1964 and 1968, the total population increased annually
by 2.3%, the population supplied by SONEDE by 5.3%, and water sales by
10% (see Annex 1 and Clhart 1). This rate of growth in water sales is
high and can be attributed to:-
(a) an increase in urban population due to rural
migration;
(b) improved housing on a large scale;
(c) interest-free credits, repayable over 10 years
for new connection costs - available since 1961
to aU applicants for domestic supply; and
(d) the expansion of tourism from a bed capacity of
4,000 in 1962 to nearly 25,000 in 1968 (sse
Chart 3).
2.04      Future demand is expected to grow at rates of 7% to 10% per
year. The lower figure assumes (a) that urban growth will be only 3%
per year as a result of restricted rural migration to the cities and
(b) that the present low per capita consumption will increase by only
about 1% a year. The higher rate, on the other hand, assumes an urban
growth of 4.5% annually, an expanded program of new connections and an
annual growth rate in per capita consumption of about 2% (see Annex 1).
Although the higher growth rate in demand is attainable, the lower es-
timate of 7% is deemed more likely to be correct and has been used for
financial projections.



2.05      The Map shows the location of the major water systems.  The main
population centers are on the coast where water is scarce, and the main
sources of fresh water are located at considerable distances.  This accounts
for the relatively high coet -of water supply in Tunisia.  The Tunis area
(75,oo001/ inihabitants, consuming 43% of total water supplied in the
country) is fed mainly from dams about 120 km distant; Sousse and the popu-
lated Sahel area (population 400,000) from groundcwater catchment areas
west of Kairouan, about 90 km distant; and Sfax (population 250,000) from
springs and wells near Kasserine (180 km). The growing tourist areas in
southern Tunisia (Djerba-Zarzis) are supplied with slightly saline water
from boreholes up to 120 km distant. Bizerte and the other industrial
cities in the area (population 200,000), however, have groundwater catch-
ment areas fairly near, and the main tourist area of Nabeul and vicinity
(150,000) is supplied from local vells, though these are approaching the
limit of utilization.
2.06      All knoanm fresh-water resources are expected to be fully developed
by 1985, and consultants are now engaged on a study of resources in northern
Tunisia to prepare plans for their optimum allocation among competing needs.
These plans 'wiil give priority to urban requirements which will account
for about 25% of the total fresh-water resources, with the remainder al-
located to new agricultural projects.
2.07      Prior to July 1968, a section of the Department (now Ministry)
of Agriculture entitled Regie de Distribution des Eaux (RDE) was responsible
for all potable water supplies, although the distribution system in the
city of Tunis was actually operated by Societe Tunisienne d'Electricite
et du Gaz (STEG) on an agency basis, and in one or two other places by
the municipality. Large-scale works were carried out by a different section
of the Ministry of Agriculture.  In general, RDE did not have adequate
financial resources nor sufficient qualified staff, and its status as a
minor government department did not permit satisfactory planning, accounting
or management. As part of the conditions for Loan 581-TUN, the Government
established in July 1968 the autonomous national water board, SONEDE, for
more effective management.
2.08      A forecast of water needs through 1986 was prepared by the
Government in 1967 and an outline of the works necessary to meet those
needs was drawn up.  Of that outline, only the first stage is to be im-
plemented by means of the National 'Water Supply Program 1968-1973, which
would in general meet demand up to about 1980. This program can be divided
into three parts, as follows:
l/ Population figures in this paragraph refer to population supplied with
water by SONEDE.



- 5 -
(a) TThe first project, for which the Bank and Sweden
have already agreed to lend US$20 million (D 10.4
million) under Loan 581-TUN and the related Swedish
Credit. This project i^ias mainly for high-priority
supply works for the most populated areas (Tunis,
the Sahel region and the Nabeul/Hammamet area of
Cap Bon) and was originally estimated to cost
D 17.1 million (US$32.8 million) though more recent
estimates revise this total to D 14.8 million
(US$28,4 million). Project costs and procurement
status appear in Annex 3.
(b)  The second project, which is the subject of the IDA
Credit now proposed, consisting mainly of supply works
for the tourist areas of southern Tunisia, the SPhel,
and the Cap Bon region (continuation of program of
works started with the first project as regards the
latter two areas); and for other, largely industrial,
towns not covered in the first project. The estimated
cost is D 10 million (US$19.2 million); and
(c)  A third part consisting of miscellaneous works and
renewals, to cost approximately D 5.5 million
(US$10.6 million), wbich SONEDE is executing with
some bilateral financing assistance from Sweden,
US-AID, and the Federal Republic of Germany.
2.09      After completion of the 1968-1973 program further major works
will be needed in the areas of Djerba, Sfax and Lake Ischkeul.  Rough
estimates for Djerba/Sfax are D 5 million in 1974-1976 and for the Lake
Ischkeul Region D 8 million in 1977-1980. Project preparation for Djerba/
Sfax is included in the proposed IDA/Swedish Credit (see paragraph 4.08).
2.10      The foregoing relates mainly to capital expenditure on new
works.  On top of these, SONEDE was faced with major repairs to existing
installations after the severe floods of 1969 which fortunately have not
caused as much danage as was at first feared. Bilateral aid from Holland,
U.K. and others is expected to finance more than half the estimated repairs
expenditure of D 600,000 (US$1.15 million). There weas also a loss of
revenue estimated at D 100,000 (US$192,000).

III. THE BENEFICIARY
A. Organization and Management
3.01      SONEDE, which took over the operations of RDE in 1968, has
become a sound water supply undertaking, capable of carrying out the project.
3.02      SONEDE is an autonomous water supply organization having the
status of a public industrial and commercial enterprise and is owned by
the Government, which now exercises its supervision through the Ministry
of Agriculture. There is a Board of Directors, the majority of whom are
appointed in their capacity as public officials; the Board is headed by
a Chairman who at present is the Secretary of State for Agriculture. The
day-to-day management is entrusted to a Director-General, with three
departmental directors for Engineering, Administration and Finance, and
Operations (see Chart 4). Many of the staff are former employees of RDE,
the predecessor organization (see paragraph 2.07).
3.03      In addition to the two firms of consultants already mentioned
(SOGETHA for engineering and SEMA for organization and management), SONEDE
is assisted by an adviser to the Director-General seconded from Electricite
de France. The appointment of consultants and the adviser is a requirement
of the Loan Agreement for the first project. SONEDE is also committed
not to change its senior personnel or organizational structure without
consulting the Bank.
3.04      The proficiency of the staff has improved noticeably since SONEDE
commenced operations and routine tasks are in general carried out with
sufficient competence. There is an Organization & Methods Section, in
which all new entrants to the Operations Department spend their first six
months.  With the exception of the Engineering Department, the professional
staff has now almost reached full strength, in lojer grades, there are some
surplus personnel inherited from RDE, who are being eliminated more slowly
than had been anticipated. Until recently, staff morale, previously satis-
factory, has been impaired by the continuing failure to establish a uniform
scale of salaries, so that there could be three or four different pay
levels for the same grade of staff. Uniform salary scales for SONEDE,
suitable to retain qualified staff, have now been approved.
3.05      In the Engineering Department there had been an unaccountable
delay in installing the procedures recommended by SEMA and in recruiting
the necessary staff, especially site engineers needed to supervise the
large program of capital works.  Without these, there was a very real risk
of losing control of expenditures in both projects. The newJ procedures
have now been installed and SONEDE is recruiting site engineers from
Compagnie Generale des Eaux in France.



-7 -
3.06      SONEDE carries insurance covering motor vehicles, workmen's
compensation, and public liability. Cover against claims due to polluted
water is only up to D 50,000 (US$96,000) per occurrence which is considered
inadoquate; it was agreed during negotiations to double this average.
B. Accounting and Audit
3.07      The accounting system, which was designed and installed within
the past two years by consultants provided under the previous Bank loan,
is mechanized to a considerable degree and has been working smoothly and
efficiently.  There are, however, still delays in receiving information
from other departments and authorities. Machine processing of accounts
is largely decentralized among different outside agencies, but it is planned
to bring ail this into one computer installation in 1970. The costing
system which is still in its formative stages is not integrated and cost
accounts have to be built up by extraction from the financial accounts.
3.08      The Government exercises its legal financial supervision over
SONEDE through a controller; under Loan 581-TUN an agreement was reached
that this control would be supplemented by an annual external audit. The
first such audi, was recently carried out by a local auditor and not found
adequate. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that an adequate
audit will be carried out and that SONEDE vill submit to the Association
audited statements and the audit report within 4 months after the close
of the fiscal year.
C. Water-Rates and Earnings
3.09      The Income Account for SONEDE's initial operating period, the
part-year ended December 31, 1968, is summarized in Annex 8 and shows a
deficit, because existing water rates were inadequate. As a condition
of Loan 581-TUN, those rates were increased in October 1968 from an average
of 32 millimes per m3 (US$0.23 per 1000 gallons) to an estimated average
of 60 millimes per m3 (US$0.44 per 1000 gallons) which entailed a 70%
increase for the domestic category and larger proportionate increases for
the others as shown below:
Old Rates     New Rates      Increase

General Customersi/          40             68            70%

l/ Including hotels.



- 8 -
The old rates dated fromn 1961 and were substantially lower than those in
force before that date.  Calculations made during the first six months of
the new rates show that these actually produced on average 62 millimes/m3
billed, or 64 millimes/m3 supplied -  the difference arises from a minimum-
charge provision in the domestie tariff.  This minimum charge is regarded
as penalizing the poorest consumer and SONEDE is abolishing it; all
charges for water supplied will then be on metered consumnption. Advance
deposits are required and there are supplementary charges for maintenance
and ineter rents, plus a Government tax of 4.3% on water bills.
3.10      Rates have been uniform throughout the country since 1961, but
in some tourist areas, the cost of expanding the supply capacity to meet
growing peak demands becomes increasingly disproportionate to the marginal
revenue deri.ved, so that such supplies become more and more unprofitable
to SONEDE and increasingly subsidized by the general consumer. SONEDE is
to undertake a cost/user study in these areas and the Government has
agreed to authoriæe graduated higher rates where this study indicates a
substantial loss to SONEDE.
3.11      SONEDE is conmittecS by Loan Agreement 581-TUN to maintaining an
average of 60 millimes per m through 1970 and to earning a rate of return on
net fixed assets of 5% in 1971-1973 and 6% thereafter. For reasons explained
inparagraph 6.06 it was agreed to amend this covenant and SONEDE
should be able to comply with fhe amended covenant with one further rate
increase, to 70 millimes per m , in 1973.
D. Present Financial Position
3.12      Audited balance sheets as at July 2, 1968 (opening balance sheet)
and December 31, 1968, are summarized in Annex 10.  Ail of RDE's fixed
assets and supplies were handed over to SONEDE, but the values of fixed
assets - D 45.3 million (US$87.0 million) at handover - are still tech-
nically provisional in that the Valuation Commission appointed to settle
them is held up over questions of title. It is however expected to complete
its work during 1970 and the final values should not differ substantially
from the provisional values which wore based on replacement costs.
Depreciation is applied on the revalued assets at rates which average 2.5%.
3.13      SONEDE's equity comes mainly from the Government either by way
of the assets handed over (less loan debt attaching thereto) or by way of
capital contributions in cash (see paragraph 3.14below). Other sources
of equity are consumers' contributions to the cost of mains extensions,
which are capitalized, and any accumulated earned surplus.
3.14      The Government appropriated D 10.6 million (US$20.3 million)
to enable SONEDE to carry out its share of the 1968-1973 program. Authori-
zations of payment from this appropriation are enacted annually, and



- 9 -
payments are made against SONEDE's quarterly requisitions. At the date
of the appraisal mission, the contribution appropriated for 1968 had been
paid and also about half the appropriation for 1969, and SONEDE's liquid
balances are at present reasonably adequate.
3.15      SONEDE took over the liability for existing loans relating to
water supply installations. These are nearly all bilateral aid loans and
are detailed in Annex 4. The balance outstanding at the date of take-over
was D 10.5 million (US$20.1 million). The debt/equity ratio at December3l,
1968 was 37:63 and at the end of 1969 was estimated to have improved to
32:68.
3.16      New connections are charged to the applicant at estimated cost
but domestic consumers are allowed 10 years to pay, by installments.   This
gives rise to increasing balances of long-term "receivables" when supplies
are being extended.
3.17      SONEDE's working capital at December 31, 1968 was negligible
and if inventory is excluded, was negative. Over the years it is expected
to rise and show a current ratio of about 3:1 in 1973, although this is
not in itself significant since the Government contribution is intended
partly to supply working capital up to that year. Later years, however,
indicate a further improvement in this ratio.
3.18      Unpaid water charges at December 31, 1968, were D 1.1 million
(US$2.1 million) representing about  ½2 monthsl revenues; and by December 31,
1969 had increased to about D 2 million. These relate only to charges
due since SONEDE was formed, and the increase in 1969 may be attributed
to three factors - first and principally, to the doubling of the rate
of charge; secondly to unpaid bills due from the Government (approximately
D 1 million at October 31, 1969); and thirdly, to a changeover from billing
in quarterly batches to continuous billing, which tends to inflate arrears
initially but later speeds up recovery. Early payment of Governnent water
charges from 1969 onward was the subject of an undertaking under Loan 581-
TUN, but in 1969 this did not work out s.tisLactoril-, because the National
Budget provisions for these payments were based on incomplete Government
records. During negotiations the Government submitted acceptable proposals
which would clear, by means of extra-budgetary allocations, current charges
and arrears by the end of 1970 and itould settle arrears owed by local
government.
3.19      Other balances, on both sides of SONEDE's December 1968 balance
sheet, arise from the operation of Tunis supply (until March 31, 1969) by
STEG. The Government's guarantee of Loan 581-TUN contains an undertaking
that collections by STEG would be remitted monthly to SONEDE. In fact,
up to December 1969 STEG had made no payments since SONEDE was created
and owed D 116,000 (US$222,000) for sums collected in the second half of
1968, and a probably similar (but as yet unascertained) amount for the
period to March 31, 1969, after which date eEG was no longer concerned
with water supply operation. Conversely, SONEDE owes STEG considerable
sums for supplies and works, payment being withheld pending satisfactory
accounting from STEG. During negotiations it was agreed that the Government
would cause the two bodies to reach a satisfactory settlement before the
Credit becomes effective.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description of Project
4.01      The project, which forms part of the 1968-1973 National Water
Supply Program (see paragraph 2.08), consists of eight sub-projects for
four regions of Tunisia (Bizerte, Cap Bon, Sahel and South Tunisia) and
four cities, (Beja, Gabes, Kelibia and Sfax) which will have their water
supply systems expanded and reinforced (for details see Annex 5 and Map).
The sub-projects for Sahel and Cap Bon will complete, for these regions,
the construction program started under the first water supply project.
The main features of the sub-projects are the construction or reinforce-
ment of transmission pipelines but they will include wells, punping stations,
storage tanks and a few distribution mains.
4.02      The specific features of the project are:
(a) For the region of Bizerte, groundtrater resources
from Mateur (300 1/sec) would be developed and
made available to the industrial cities of Menzel
Bourguiba and Bizerte.
(b) For the Cap Bon region, a pipeline of about 70 km
will bring about 200 1/sec to the tourist resorts
of the region.
(c)  For the populous region of Sahel, completion of
the new transmission pipeline and reinforcement
of its north and central branches would increase
the available capacity to 1,100 1/sec. A new
branch line would connect the city of Kairouan to
the Sahel system.
(d) For the southern Tunisia region the existing trans-
mission pipeline to the tourist resorts of Djerba
and Zarzis is to be doubled in three stages: the
first stage is under construction, the second is part of
this project, and the third stage is planned for 1974.
(e) For Beja, where Tunisia's sugar industry is concen-
trated, the project would improve the supply by
linking Beja to the pipeline which conveys water
£rom Ben Metir Dam to Tunis.
(f)  For the new tourist resorts of Kelibia and Gabes, the
capacity of the systems would be expanded and distri-
bution mains would supply the newly developed hotel areas.



(g) For Sfax, the country's second largest city, the
project would increase capacity by 100 1/sec as
the first stage of a larger program which plans
to double in 197U-1975 the existing capacity of
the 180 km pipeline from Sbeitla to Sfax.
4.03      In general, the works are designed ultimately to meet the water
demand of 1986 in the most economical way.  Construction of each sub-
project is staged to provide flexibility and avoid over-investment should
tourism growth and urban water demand projections prove too optimistic.
Using  the same assumptions as for the sector (see paragraph 2.04), two
water demand forecasts were made for the areas affected by the first and
second projects. The project under review would meet the peak daily water
demand at least until about 1976, and more likely until 19801/. IWater
sales in project areas are expected to increase at annual rates of 7% to
10% (see Annex 2 and Chart 2). For the southern Tunisia and Sfax sub-projects
the capacity of works would be utilized at an earlier date and additional
works are therefore planned for 1974.

4.05           The project cost estimates were prepared by SONEDE and the
consultants. Unit costs are generally conservative in the light of results
of recent international tenders made for Loan 581-TUN. SONEDE provided a
total of 15% for contingencies and engineering. The Association increased
this to 27%, with 15% for technical contingencies, 3.5% for consultants,
contract administration and supervision, and the balance of 8.5% represent-
ing a factor for price escalation throughout the design and construction
period (approximately equivalent to 3.5% per year).
C. Prcposed Amount of Joint IDA/Swedish Credit
4.06      The project would be financed by a joint IDA/Swedish Credit of
US$14 million representing 73% or total project costs. The proposed IDA
Credit would be for US$10.5 million and the Swedish Credit for US$3.5 million.
The joint credit would finance aUl foreign exchange costs estimated at
US$11.33 million, and would finance about one-third of the local costs of
works for an amount of US$2.67 million. The IDA Credit alone would finance
75% of the foreign exchange costs and about 25% of local costs.

D. Project Design and Construction
4.07      SONEDE submitted studies which were generally adequate for the
major sub-projects but less so for several minor ones. As a result of a
review of the sensitivity of projected demand, the phasing of the sub-
projects was modified and the project was reduced to its present size.
4.08      SOGETHA, the Fronch engineering consultant of SONEDE will prepare
the detailed engineering and tender documents. The foreign exchange costs
on this contract will be financed by Loan 581-TUN and the credit would
include only foreign exchange costs of --
(a) general supervision and contract administration, and
(b) engineering of the next stage of the southern
Tunisia and Sfax projects (see paragraph 2.09).
4.09      The construction period for the project would run from 1971
through 1973. The works schedule is shown in Chart 5.



- 13 -
4.1Q      Contract administration and supervision of construction are to be
done by 3ONEDE's own Engineering and New Works Department.  The Department
is being reinforced by experienced site engineers from Compagnie Generale
des Eaux (France). As in the case of Loan 581-TUN, a team of senior en-
gineers from SOGETHA will exercise general supervision of the project
including certification of payments.
E. Procurement
4.11      International competitive bidding is to be adopted for all major
supply and construction contracts. All construction work is to be done by
contractors. The same provisions as in the Guarantee Agreement of Loan
581-TUN will apply to the prompt issue by Government of import licenses
for procurement of foreign goods.
4.12      Pipe supply contracts are likely to be awarded to foreign sup-
pliers since the cost of medium sized steel and cast iron pipes not manu-
factured in Tunisia is expected to be lower than for the locally produced
concrete pipes.
4.13      In addition to customs duties and similar levies paid on imported
goods, all suppliers, whether local or foreign, are subject to the same
production tax (a type of valuo added tax) and to a ccnsumption tax in
some specific instances. For imported goods, these taxes are applied to
the landed cost. For local goods they are included in the ex-factory
price. It was agreed during negotiations that for purposes of bid com-
parisons the CIF cost would be taken for imported goods, and that produc-
tion and consumption taxes would be taken out of the ex-factory price in
order to have a comparable price basis. A margin of preference of 15%
or customs duties, whichever is less, would then be allowed for domestic
manufacturers by adding such margins to the CIF price of imported goods
lor bid comparisons.
P. Disbursement
4.14      All disbursement requests will come to IDA., and IDA having
approved the request, the amounts to be disbursed -will be divided between
IDA and Sweden on a three-to-one basis.
4.15      It is proposed that the IDA. and Swedish Credits be disbursed on
the basis of --
(a)  the actual foreign exchange costs of consultant
services and of imported goods;
(b)  40% of the cost of construction contracts or of
goods fabricated or procured locally, this per-
centage being subject to revision by IDA and
Swveden in order to disburse no more than the
Credits amounts or up to 73% of the total project
cost, whichever is less.



- 14 -
4.16      If the project cost is greater than estimated, 90NEDE would meet
the over-run, the Tunisian Government being committed to provide funds
for the project should SONEDE be unable to do so. In the event project
cost is less than estimated, it is proposed that the balance of the
Credit be applied to related parts of the program if justified.
G. Water Rights and Land Acquisition
4.17      The Department of Hydraulics (HER) of the Ministry of Agriculture
is responsible for the allocation of water resources in Tunisia. Assurances
vere obtained during negotiations that the Government, without prejudice
to its general obligation under the law creating SONEDE to make available
all necessary potable water resources, will grant to SONEDE the use of
ground water resources in the Mateur, Kelibia and Gabes areas to the
extent required for this project.
4.18      Assurances were also obtained that the Governnent will ensure
that procedures for expropriation or for the right of temporary occupancy
will be applied for the benefit of SONEDE if they are requested.



- 15 -
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      This phase of the National Water Program comprises a series of
regional sub-projects needed to meet the demands of tourism and industry
as well as the growth of urban water consumption stimulated by these
developments.
5.02      Annexes 1 and 2 and Chart 2 show statistics of past consumption
and forecasts of water demand, which is growing faster than population.
Total population is growing at the rate of 2-3% a year, urban population
at 4-5%, and water sales at about 10%o; yet there are still shortages. In
1969 alone, about 1h,000 new connections were made, still leaving some
12,000 applications unsatisfied, whereas as recently as 1961 there were
only 45,000 existing connections in the whole country.
5.03      In many cities, demand has outgroem the carrying capacity of
the distribution systems, causing pressure drops. These can permit con-
taminated water to enter the system with a risk of water-borne epidemic
disease, besides driving the wealthier inhabitants to buy bottled water
at about 1000 times the price. If the supply of water cannot keep up
with the expanding demand then, because its quality will deteriorate, its
value to users - and their willingness to pay for it - will also decrease.
5.04      Tourism is one of the fastest-growing activities in Tunisia, as
may be inferred from the folloiing table:
No. of beds 1962      -    4,000
No. of beds 1969      -   31,000
Est. No. of beds 1972      -   56,000 (See also Chart 3)
This is causing rapid depletion of water resources nearest the tourist
areas, and necessitates rapid expansion of t'he capacity of supply systems.
These problems are accentuated by high seasonal peaks of demand, and by
the remoteness of some of the most suitable areas for tourisia from any
substantial wiater sources. Tourism has nowr supplanted phosphates as the
country's biggest foreign exchange earner, and brings in US$40 million
yearly; at present it employs some 10,000 people and is expected to create
15,000 new jobs in the next four years. Over 70% of this project is for
tourist areas, and even so it meets forecast needs only up to 1973 or 1974
in one resort area (Djerba).
5.05      Project design and selection of the sub-projects' components
were based on economic evaluations of alternatives, using a discount rate
of 8%.



- 16 -
5.06      The incremental rate of return on the program calculated during
the first project appraisal wias 11%. A revised svaluatioin made during the
appraisal shows that the incremental rate of return on the inrvestments in
areas covered by the first and second projects taken together (areas which
are virtually identical with those included in the total 1968-1973 program)
remains 11% using the most likely sales forecast. The calculation shown
in Annex 7, takes account only of additional revenues fron water charges
and does not attempt to quantify any other benefits ta the economy, such
as improved public health, fire protection, and those resulting from
tourism.  Another calculation using the higher but still attainable sales
projection would produce an incremental rate of return of 1%.

VI. FINANCING PLAN AND FUT,URE FINANCIAL POSITION
A. Financing Plan
6.01       Financial statements covering the period 1968 through 1979 appear
in Annexes 8, 9 and 10; Annex 11 shows the assumptions on which these pro-
jections are based.  Of the capital requirements for the 1968-1973 program,
47% will be met by borrowing, 27% by capital contributions from the Tunisian
Government and consumers, and 26% from net internal cash generation. The re-
quirements and sources of funds during the construction period 19681/ to

6.02      The cost shown above for the first project is lower than the origin-
al estimate of D 17.1 million because of low bids on contracts placed to date.
The financing plan accordingly shows the reduced amount of capital expenditures
and loan funds. However, the magnitude of the savings on this project will not
be certain before 1973. Any surplus that should materialize in Loan 581-TUN
after the completion of the project should be applied to related parts of the
program as justified.
6.03      The proposed IDA Credit for the second project is to be re-lent to
SOUEDE on terms similar to those which would now apply to a Bank loan - 7%
interest with repayment over 25 years including a 5-year grace period. The
Swedish Credit is to be lent on IDA terms to the Government and re-lent to
SONEDE on the same IDA terms (as for the first project).
6.04      The other loans included in the Financing Plan are small residual
loans under earlier bilateral agreements, from Sweden and the Federal
Republic of Gernany (see Annex 4).
6.05      The Government of Tunisia undertook as a condition of the Bank
loan for the first project to provide SONEDE not only with sufficient funds
to carry out the project but also to contribute a specified sum towards the
entire 1968-1973 program under specific financing assumptions which included
additional external borrowings. With the support of the Swedish Credit
towazrds the sector, the full amount of the Governnent contribution is no
longer needed and has been reduced to D 7.8 million in the financing plan.
However, the Government will still guarantee that it will moet any additional
shortfalls in funds to complete the projects.
6.06      Internal cash generation is calculated on the basis of a rate in-
crease from 60 millimes (average) to 70 millimes (average) per m3 in 1973.
The rate covenant in the first project loan agreement provides that a rate
of return of 5% should be earned on net fixed assets during 1971-1973 and 6%
subsequently, after providing for minimum depreciation of 2%. This agreement
preceded the introduction of the new accounting system.  SONEDE has since
adopted depreciation schedules which have resulted in an average annual de-
preciation charge of 2u%. This depreciation rate reduces net income and the
rate of return without however affecting the cash generation objective. For
this reason, it has been agreed to reformulate the minimum rate requirements
of the existing covenant. In order to provide sufficient cash for its fore-
cast needs, taking also into account presently forecast sales and costs, SONEDE
should earn a minimum return of 5% in 1973-1975 and 6% subsequently after a
minimum depreciation of 2h%; only one rate increase to 70 millimes in 1973
would be required to meet this target on the basis of present forecasts. Mean-
while SONEDE is committed to maintaining an average rate of not less than
60 millimes per m3.

B. Financial Outlook
6.07      SONEDE's financial outlook is satisfactory.  Besides financing
irnternally about one-quarter of the 1968-1973 programi, it wilU continue
thereafter to generate substantial amounts of cash for self-financing. Net
cash generation from operations from 1974 through 1979 is in fact estimated
at over D 19 million (US$36 million) after providing for debt service and
working capital. This is calculated on the basis of one rate increase in 1973
(see paragraph 6.06) and using the lower forecast of future sales projected
in Annex 1. Cash generation would according to projections be sufficient to
finance all capital expenditure forecast for 197U-1979 but borrotçing would
stil be anticipated for major schemes during those years. If and when
-excessive cash balances accumulate, their utilization would be a matter for
discussion between SONEDE, the Government, the Bank group and SIDA.
6.08      Annex 9 shcuTs that debt service coverage (i.e. the ratio of net
operating  i.ncome, before depreciation and interest, to total debt service
for the same year) is at least 2.7 times after 1969.  The debt/equity ratio
should remain satisfactory throughout the period covered by projections
(see Annex 10). The Agreement for Loan 581-TUN contains limitations on
capital expenditure without the Bank's approval and on incurrence of debt,
other than for that project. Under the latter covenant, net revenues at
the time of incurrence, before depreciation and interest, must be at least 1.5
times the maximum future debt service on the proposed loan and existing debt
unless the Bank agrees otherwise and this requirement is repeated for the
proposed credit.
6.09      SONEDE's rate of return on average net fixed assets should rise
from a negative return in 1968 (because the old rates were then in force)
to 1.7% in 1969, thence to about 4% in 1971, 5% or over from 1973 onwards,
and gradually to over 8% in 1979 (see Annex 8).

VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) The application of graduated higher rates
in tourist areas if found necessary
(paragraph 3.10).
(b)  Settlement of Government and Municipal
arrears of water charges (paragraph 3.18).
(c) Impro-vements in various administrative
and technical matters and functions
(paragraphs 3.06, 3.08, 4.17 and 4.18).
(d) lWater tariffs are to be maintaïned at present
level and raised, if necessary, to meet specified
rates of return on net fixed assets (paragraph 6.06).
7.02      The Government has now authorized SONEDE to implement new uniform
salary scales (paragraph 3.04); and SONEDE is recruiting experienced site
engineers from France (paragraphs 3.05 and 4.10).
7.03      A condition of effectiveness of the present credit is that
SONEDE and STEG shall have concluded a satisfactory agreement determining
the amounts of accounts pending between then and the terms and conditions
of payment thereof (paragraph 3.19).
7.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
Credit of US$10.5 million, relent to SONEDE at 7% interest, repayable
over 25 years including a 5 year grace period.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
This section describes in brief detail the various sub-projects.
The various elements and their costs are shown in Annex 6.
Cap Bon II (Nabeul-Hammamet)
To supplement the fully utilized water resources of the Nabeul
area, a pipeline would connect Hammam Li£ (suburb of Tunis) to Mamoura
(suburb of Nabeul). In addition to the Nabeul-Hammamet area, the pipeline
would supply the towns of Grombalia, Soliman and Bordj Cedria. The pipeline
was designed to meet the estimated peak daily demand of the tourist resorts
of 1976. Flow would be by gravity except in a section of 16.5 km where a
booster station in Grombalia would elevate the water about 55 m.
Storage tanks are being built und3r the first project in Nabeul,
Mamoura, Hammamet and an additional 5,000 m  storage tank would be built
to supply tourist resorts between Nabeul and Hammamet (Sillonville).
In the region of North Nabeul-Mamoura, distribution lines will
supply new resorts area.
South Tunisia (Djerba-Zarzis)
The existing transmission pipeline from the groundwater catchment
areas, north-west of Medenine to Djerba, Zarzis, Medenine and Ben Gardane
is to be doubled in three stages, the first of which is under construction.
Vhen completed, the system will be-àb1l-to supplyf2-7  1/sec compared to
the present 90 1/sec.
The sub-project would increase capacity to 160 1/sec, which should
be enough to provide for the estimated peak water demand of population and
tourism until 197h, adith tourism accommodation of 11,300 (4,500 existing,
4,300 under construction and 2,500 estimated to start), or until 1980 if
no additional tourism accommodations are started. Construction of the third
stage will therefore depend on the rate of growth of tourism. Works of the
second stage consist of 36.8 km of 400 mm supply mains and 15 km of 500 mm
pipes for the Djerba distribution system.

Sahel II
Works to increase groundwater production would include:
(i)  Equipment and construction of 5 pumping stations for
existing boreholes at Henchir el Grine (1), Haffouz (1),
Bou Hafna (3), and construction and equipment of a new
borehole at Cherichera;
(ii)  groundwater collection pipelines to link these boreholes
to the main transmission pipeline. Pipe lengths would
amount to 7 km of 800 mmi, 6.6 km of 400 mm, 6.8 km of 300 mm,
and 2.2 km of 200 minm.
The capacity of the main transmission line (from Cherichera to
El Onk) is being increased from 360 1/sec to about 1,100 1/sec under Loan
581-TUN, and in this project, the doubling of the line would be completed
by construction of a section of 9.6 km of 800 mm pipe.
The Main Sahel line supplies North Sahel through a system known
as the North Sahel. This system is being reinforced by a program of works
started under Loan 581-TUN and works included in this project will complete
the program. Works include the following supply lines:
(i)  El Onk - Oued Laya           - 7 km of 600 mm pipe;
(ii)  Oued Laya - Matmeur          -  2.h km of 300 mm pipe;
(iii)  Oued Laya - Akouda           -  3.1 km of 400 mm pipe;
(iv)  Les Deux Soeurs - Hergla    - 5.6 km of 200 mm pipe.
The main Sahel line supplies the Central and South Sahel through
the system known as the "Central Sahel". The following works are included
in the project:
(i)  El Onk - Harkoussia      -  17.8 km of 800 mm and 9.8 km
of 600 mn pipe;
(ii)  Harkoussia - Bekalta    -   2.4 km of 600 mmn, 4 km of 500 mmi,
and 4.5 km of 400 mm pipe;
(iii)  Supply antennas to       -   21.9 km of smaller pipes
population centers           (80 mm to 300 mm)
(iv)  Twio 15 hp pumping stations, one in Skanes, one in Mateur.



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 4 pages
The city of Kairouan will also be supplied by the main Sahel
line. A new (400 mm) branch line of 6.2 km would supply 120 1/sec from
the Sahel system to Kairouan. Other works would include a storage tank
of 5,000 m3, water control structures and a pumping station (180 hp).
Bizerte
Groundwater resources in the Mateur area would provide 300 1/sec.
Seven new boreholes would be constructed and equipped and three existing
boreholes would also be equipped. Groundwater collection lines would in-
clude 8 km of 500 mm, 2 km of 400 mm, and 1 km of 300 mm pipe.
The existing transmission pipelines from Mateur to Menzel
Bourguiba and from Menzel Bourguiba to Bizerte would be reinforced by
about 24 km of 600 mm and 10 km of 400/500 mm pipe.  Three booster punping
stations (280 hp, 220 hp, and 35 hp) are also included in the project.
Sfax
Groundwater resources production in Sbeitla would be inereased
by 100 1/sec by constructing and equipping new boreholes and connection
of these wells to the Sbeitla-Sfax pipeline.
The pipeline itself would be reinforced by doubling a section
of 21.2 km with pipes f 600 mmi (19.3 km) and 500 mm (1.9 km).
The main supply line of the distribution system would be re-
inforced by installation of 7.7 km of 800 mm pipe.
Gabes
The Gabes water system, which has been recently taken over by
SONEDE, needs rehabilitation as well as extensions to supply newly develop-
ing tourist areas. Preliminary engineering of the project is not completed.
The project -would include wells, supply mains to tourist areas and re-
habilitation of the existing distribution system.
Kelibia
Water supply to the developing tourist zone w5ill be assured by:
(i) construction and equipment of a new borehole,
(ii)  installation of a 250 mm supply main, and
(iii) a 5 km distribution main (300 mm) to the tourist area.

Incremental Rate of Return
A. Rate of Return - Using "Likely" Sales Forecast (Seo Annex 2)
Benefits
The gross revenue and the operating expenses for 1972 from
hnnex 8 - Projected Income Statements represent the situation without the
first and second projects. (Although project construction continues into
1973, the increased sales in 1973 are due to elements of these projects
previously completed.)
Because water sales in project areas represent 83% of total sales,
the Benefits of the projects are assumed equal to 83% of SONEDE's total
revenues minus operating expenses, i.e., Income before Depreciation and
Taxes (since Taxes are a benefit to the comunity even though they are
operating expenses for SONEDE). The net annual benefits due to the projects
are the increases in the benefits over the 1972 base year. Total Revenues
of 1972 were increased to represent the rate level of 1973 and subsequent
years. The 1972 base is accordingly 83% of 3.77 million dinars, i.e.
3.12 million dinars. The Bene its of 1982, when total sales in project
areas will reach 1i1 million ms per year, are the maximum level that
corresponds to the maximum sales potential that can be expected from the
new facilities and these are assumed to continue at that level until 2010.
Costs - Annex 9
Projected Cash Flow Statement shows first and second project
costs. These costS were reduced by 15% to offset customs duties and value
added taxes on contracts.
To the project costs were added the following complementary costa
whose benefits cannot be dissociated from project works:

Tunis (Gdir El-Goulla Plant)       0.35
Total                         0.95
Thesc costs were also reduced by 15% to take into account customs duties and
value added taxes. Costs of extensions paid by customers were not inciluded
on the ground that thie latter represent a measure of the minimum value rocei.ved.

Benefits
Benefits are calculated on similar basis, as in "A" but since
sales are higher, the net annual benefits are adjusted in proportion to
the level of sales. The maximum level of benefits is attained in 1978
and will continue until 2010.

TUNTSIA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions_for Financial Tables
Income Statements
1.        Production and sales of water in cubie meters are according
to the lower of the projections sho   in Annex 1.  Present tariffs pro-
duce an average of 64 millimes per m sold, but this is partly inflated
by a "minimum consunption" requirement, for domestic supplies (at the
highest rate of charge). If that is abolished the average rate would
fall to about 61 millimes, and therefore 60 millimes has been taken as
the revenue per m3 until 1973 when a rate increase to 70 millimes is
assumed.
2.        "Other Fees and Charges" are mainly for maintenance and meter
rents. These are calculated at D 3.1 per connection, on the average
number in service each year.
3.        Uncollectable revenues reduce gradually from about 12% of
revenues in 1969 to 5% in 1975 on the assumption of improved efficiency
in collection. (For this purpose only, "revenues" is taken to include
consumers' contributions to new extensions, though these are strictly
capital receipts.) The Government is introducing measures for speedier
settlement of water charges (including all arrears), not only by public
departments, but also by municipalities; and these measures may accelerate
even further the anticipated decline in irrecoverable and disputed
charges.
4.       Wages and salaries reflect full staffing at professional level
and the implementation of a uniform salary scale, and are increased by
about 3% annually to reflect salary increments. Increases in staff for
new installations are assumed to be compensated by reduction of the
presently inflated operating staff.
5.        Energy and chemical costs are projected in proportion to sales
projections, after taking account of:
(a) changeover from liquid fuel to electricity on
certain installations; and
(b) differing neoeds for chemicals in different
regions, as adjusted for improved treatment
plant operation.



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3 pages
6.        Cost of materials consumed is estimated to remain fairly con-
stant, because increased consumption due to the grawth of the undertaking
in later years is assumed to be almost counterbalanced by the backlog of
maintenance to be made good in the early years. Other operating expenses
are assumed to rise gradually, calculations being based on various factors -
the number of connections, the value of fixed assets, personnel expenses,
or otherwise, as appropriate to the particular item of expense.
7.        The sums shown as transferred to Cppital Account represent labor,
materials, etc., included in operating expenses but in fact employed on
constructing fixed assets (principally mains extensions), which should
therefore be charged to capital expenditure and not to Income Account.
The estimate for this cannot be fixed with any precision, since SONEDE
has such a short previous operating experience; a notional figure of
D 100,000 per year has been assumed as the practicable capacity of the
Operating Department for this work, any excess being presumed to be contracted
out.
8.        Depreciation is taken to be at an average rate of 2;1o calculated
on the mid-year value of fixed assets (assumed as the mean of the values
at the beginning and end of the year).  Lhe total depreciation in each
year does not agree with the depreciation charged in Income Account; this
is because depreciation of mains extensions originally financed by consumers'
contributions is not charged to revenue, being instead applied in wtriting
down the value of those contributions in the Balance Sheet.
9.        A constant level of prices has been assumed throughout, except
for escalation contingencies allowed in project estimates.
Cash FlolT Statements
10.       "Other Schemes and Works" include Djerba-Sfax (D 5 million
1974-1976) and Lake Ischkeul (D 7 million 1977-1979), both assumed financed
50% by loans repayable over 20 years from date of completion of works,
at 7% interest.
il.       Expenditure on the first and second projects is shown in these
tables on the  basis of the value of work done, less retention moneys -
i.e. on the actual cash paynents to contractors.
Balance Sheet
12.       Fixed assets include initial organizational expenses for con-
venience, since these are relatively small and are being amortized over
a short period.

13.       Accounts receivable (short-term) are high in 1969 reflecting
the unsatisfactory situation over Government water charges, and the sums
owed by STEG. For subsequent years, it is assumed that these balances
have been reduced or eliminated, but water rate arrears for all consumers
are taken as being at a prudent level of about 28% of the year's charges.
Accounts receivable (long-term) are for outatanding balances of new con-
nection credits. Accounts payable after 1969 are calculated as approxi-
mately li½ months' running expenses for suppliers' invoices, plus consumerst
deposits (in proportion to connections) and an allowance for other
creditors and accruals.
14.       For new connections, estimates have been made of the number
carried out in each year; for each, an average charge of D 30 has been
assumed for the connection, and of D 15 for the related extension of mains
at the consumer's expense.  The whole rechargeable cost of a new connec-
tion (even though reco7erable by installments over 10 years) is correctly
deemed by SONEDE to be income of the year in which the work is done, and
is therefore carried to Income Account; but the extension, unlike the
connection, becomes SONEDE's property and this part of the charge to the
consumer is carried to "Consumerts Capital Contributions" in the Balance
Sheet, and subsequently subjected to annual depreciation.
