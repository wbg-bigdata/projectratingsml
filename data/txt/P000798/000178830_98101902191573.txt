INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia for the equivalent of
US$1.3 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for agricul-
tural development.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The last Economic Report (AW-12a) which was circulated to the
Executive Directors on December 3, 1969, concluded that The Gambia has placed
excessive emphasis on development of infrastructure and has paid insufficient
attention to agriculture. Future Government policy and external financial
assistance was thus to focus as far as possible on diversification of agricul-
ture. An economic mission visited The Gambia in November, 1971. This report
summarizes its main findings.   Country data are given in Annex II.
3.        With a population of about 380,000, The Gambia is one of the small-
est countries. It extends over both sides of the Gambia River, forming a
narrow enclave of 10,400 square kilometers within Senegal. Climate and vege-
tation are subtropical. Average rainfall, concentrated between June and
October, varies from 30 to 40 inches. Rainfed agriculture is thus restricted
to crops with a short vegetative cycle. However, irrigation is possible along
the Gambia River.  Outside the mangrove belt along the river, the country is'
mostly covered by open forest and grassland. There are few exploitable natu-
ral resources in The Gambia. Over half of GDP is derived from agriculture,
livestock and fishing, and over four fifths of its working population is in-
volved in those activities.
4.        Following the recommendations of a UN study, The Gambia and Senegal
have concluded several agreements providing for security and defense, interstate
vehicular traffic and integrated agricultural and transport development of the
Gambia River basin. In 1969, an agreement was reached on the establishment of
a Sene-Gambian customs union, although its implementation remained slow, as
long as disparities in import duties and produce prices in the two countries
influenced the direction of trade in favor of The Gambia where Senegalese
groundnuts were sold in exchange for imported consumer goods. The resulting,
trade surplus is estimated to have absorbed a large part of The Gambia's trade
deficit with the rest of the world. However, recently Senegal and The Gambia
took steps to harmonize import duties and groundnut prices. More broadly, the
customs union would have the advantage of providing The Gambia with an econom-
ically sufficiently large hinterland to allow it to make better use of its low



-2-
cost structure. Equally promising for both countries are the ongoing efforts
to coordinate the transport, communications and agr'i'cultural development in
the Gambian River basin.
5.        Exceptionally high world market prices for groundnuts, accounting
for one third of GDP and over 90 percent of exports, have resulted in'recent
years in a GDP growth of about 7 percent annually or 5 percent per capita,
buoyant export earnings, and a sharp rise in foreign exchange reserves and
public savings. However, given the prospects for considerably lower ground-
nut prices, The Gambia's possibilities for continued economic growth in the
medium and i-nger run are l             if a major effort is made to divers-
ify production.  The need for diversification is accentuated by growing un-
employment, largely seasonal: out of the 1,500 students leaving school every
year, only 300 to 400 are able to find paid year-round jobs.
6.        Government action-, aimed at reducin'g the ecbnomy'ss dependence
on groundnuts and-increasing the effi-ciency of agricultural production, has
only just begun. Inadequate investment and, perhaps even more important,
inadequate current expenditures seriously hampered agricultural development.
Nevertheless, a promising start to diversify agriculture is being made.
The Government has undertaken a few successful pilot operations in rice,
fruit, vegetables and livestock, which are expected to become ready for
exploitation on a much larger scale in the next few years. Moreover, four
major studies which should provid'e the necessary basis to expand diversifi-
cation are underway: the Land Resource Survey conducted by ODA; the Hydro-
logical Survey of the Gambia River Basin by UNDP; a fisheries survey conduct-
ed by FAO and a tourist survey financed by ODA.
7.        Fishing is a yet little exploited but important resource of The
Gambia. The establishment in 1971 of--two modern cold- storage and fish pro-
cessing plants by foreign companies marked the beginning of a large-scale
export-oriented fishing industry. Both' companies plan to double their oper-
ations over the next few years, and a third foreign fishing company is al-
ready considering establishment in The Gambia.
8.        Political stabil-ity, tax incentives and' liberal foreign trade and
exchange regulations were instrumental in attracting foreign investors not
only in fisheries, but also. in tourism.
9.        The tourism industry, practically all in the hands of private
Swedish companies, is booming. Hotel beds over the last'four years in-
creased from less than fifty to about 450 in 1970/71 and 1,000 in 1971/72.
Further hotel investment is in progress or planned. The number of tourists
rapidly increased from 800 to 8,000 in 1970/71.  During the tourist season,
bed occupancy reached about 90 percent.
10.       Nevertheless, the impact on the Gambian econo'my of tourism and
fishing is still limited. Additional amployment, about half of which is
seasonal, amounts to only about 2 percenteof wage earners. Net foreign



-3-
exchange earnings in tourism and fisheries amounted in 1971/72 to 6 and 1
percent of merchandise exports, respectively.
11.       Despite a rapid expansion of education investment during the 1960's,
adult literacy rate (10 percent) and school enrollment (24 percent) are still
very low. The present education system is inadequate, producing a growing sur-
plus of untrained manpower while at the same time, lack of qualified and skilled
manpower remains one of the constraints on development. However, before more
effective education policies can be formulated, a comprehensive review of the
country's education requirements is urgently called for.
12.       In view of the limited capacity to prepare and implement economi-
cally justified projects and the Government's conservative current expendi-
ture policy, availability of funds has not been a constraint in the past.
However, this will change in the medium and longer run since recurrent ex-
penditures for development services as well as public investment, particu-
larly in certain directly productive sectors such as agriculture, tourism
and fishing,will have to increase considerably. Thus, raising public rev-
enues is an urgent task. While the present healthy foreign exchange re-
serves will provide the Government with some breathing space to prepare new
revenue measures, these should be in effect within the next two years, if a
dangerous depletion of reserves is to be avoided.
13.       During the Government's Second Development Program (1967/68-
1970/71), annual gross public capital inflow averaged US$1.6 million equiva-
lent, financing some 75 percent of public investments. Almost 90 percent of
these funds came from the U.K., interest-free and repayable over 25 years.
14.       Total investment in the Third Program (1971/72-1973/74) is planned
to reach some US$11 million or US$3.7 million annually, an almost 80 percent
increase over the previous period. The recent economic mission has estimated
that a more realistic investment target would be about US$3.0 million annual-
ly for the next three years or US$3.5 million annually for the next five
years.
15.       Even with new tax measures and some draw-down of government depos-
its over the next two to three years, external financing would have to con-
tribute, on an average, some 80percent of public investments. Based on
the estimated disbursements (US$2.0 million) on U.K. assistance already com-
mitted or likely to be committed, disbursements from the Bank Group would
have to amount to some US$0.9 million annually or 30 percent of total dis-
bursement.
16.       In spite of the present low debt service burden, such a borrowing
program would only be consistent with a viable external and internal finan-
cial situation if it is at very concessionary terms. While the balance of
payments has been quite satisfactory over the last years, the projected fall
of groundnut prices in the next several years will change this situation.



-4-
For the period 1971/72-1975/76, we project an overall deficit of about US$1
million per year, which will have to be financed out of accumulated foreign
exchange reserves which amounted to US$16 million in June 1971. There is
thus little if any room for conventional borrowing. This situation is under-
lined by The Gambia's low per capita income (US$120), limited savings capacity
and modest prospects for economic growth (1-2 percent per capita per year).
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
1.7.      The Gambia will continue to rely heavily on U.K. aid. But the
Government is most anxious to have the Bank Group step up its operations in
The Gambia and provide help in areas where other donors are either not active
(such as agriculture) or for projects which are too large to be financed solely
with the help of other donors. Past Bank operations were limited to one IDA
credit of US$2.1 million made in 1970 for the expansion of the Bathurst port
(see sAnnex I).
18.       Pending the completion of the various sector studies underway
(paragraph 6), the Government's medium term investment intentions and thus
the size and structure of the Bank Group's Lending Program can only be ap-
proximately defined. Yet its general orientation is clear. We shall con-
tinue and expand our efforts to support the Government in diversifying pro-
duction and increasing foreign exchange earnings in areas which should
also generate substantial employment and help slow down rural-urban migra-
tion. The proposed project will help the Government achieve these objec-
tives. Rice production is perhaps the most promising proven diversifica-
tion possibility. The follow-up operation prepared under the proposed proj-
ect will also include additional crops (paragraph 32). Furthermore, the
Bank is closely associated with the ODA and UNDP studies on Upper Gambia
which should result in an integrated project involving livestock, groundnuts,
rice, feeder roads, water supply and strengthening of the extension services.
19.       Bank assistance in the diversification of the rest of the economy
is also envisaged in the more distant future through development of tourism
and fisheries, in both of which promising beginnings have been made. Devel-
opment of tourism so far has been largely haphazard and, if this process
continues, the future of tourism would be endangered. Infrastructure re-
quirements for tourism are likely to be considerable for drainage and sewerage,
telecommunications, water supply and transport. Similarly, the fishing
industry seems to have substantial investment needs for motorization of
barges, landing facilities, cold storage, and perhaps even boats for off-shore
fishing.
20.       The Bank can also play a constructive role in participating in
regional projects, such. as the Sene-Gambia bridge linking the northern and
southern parts of Senegal by a continuous highway crossing The Gambian ter-
ritory, a high priority joint development project for both countries. Bank



-5-
assistance seems particularly appropriate since the participation of other
external lenders for this relatively large project is needed, and arrange-
ments for sharing of beneiits between the two countries have to be worked
out.
21.       Since many operations in The Gambia are bound to be very small,
we are trying to combine several projects into "packages" to more rationally
utilize Bank staff time. This would seem particularly appropriate for tourism.
Its infrastructure requirements can easily be combined into such a package.
An alternative way being considered for lending to several productive sectors
is through a newly-created Development Finance Company.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
22.       Agricultural production in The Gambia accounts for about 55 percent
of GDP and provides about 90 percent of total employment. It takes place
mainly on the upland slopes of the Gambia Rivwor with soils of variable quality,
while the swampy areas along the Gambia River with relatively rich soils are
still hardly utilized because of the variable water levels in the river (para-
graph 3). The proposed project would include studies preparing the first major
scheme in these swamps.
23.       Over half of the agriculture production of The Gambia is monetized
and dominated by groundnuts which account for 70 percent of agriculture's
contribution to GDP. Another cash crop is palm kernels, all of which (about
2,000 tons in 1971) is exported.
24.       The most important subsistence crops are millet, sorghum, rice
and cassava. Rice production has substantially increased over the last ten
years, but remains insufficient to cover the growing internal demand. The
livestock population is relatively large for the size of the country. How-
ever, cattle are kept more as a status symbol than for producing meat or
milk. The potential for ocean and river fishing is good, but has hardly
been developed.
25.       Land tenure in the country is overwhelmingly traditional.   The
land in each district is vested in the district council composed of the dis-
trict and village chiefs. Each village has recognized boundaries and, with-
in these boundaries, land is held by family groups (compounds) which distrib-
ute it to adult males. Individual rights to land exist only as long as the
land is cultivated.
26.       The main constraints to rural development are the virtual absence
of rural services and infrastructure (except for river and road transport),
limited data on production possibilities and, perhaps most crucial, the lack
of Gambian technical staff. Past Government action was limited to increas-
ing groundnut exports, mainly by raising prices and improving marketing.



- 6 -
27.       But the Government is now well aware of the urgency to develop
agriculture, which will remain the mainstay of the economy. Its present
policy aims at-increasing productivity and diversifying output. In particu-
lar, it intends to increase yields of traditional cash and subsistence crops,
to introduce new cash crops and to replace the rice imported by local rice.
In pursuit of these objectives,the Ministry of Agriculture is carrying out
field experiments on dry land crops,, including groundnuts., sorghum, millet,
maize and cotton, and on irrigated crops including rice, vegetables and
citrus. Together with the results of the ongoing major land resources and
hydrological surveys., this should provide an adequate basis for developing
a comprehensive policy for agricultural diversification. Removing the other
constraints mentioned above--infrastructure and extension service--remains a
difficult but urgent task. The substantial training element included in the
proposed project is expected to make an important contribution to this end
(paragraphs 37-38). In the past, fertilizers have been subsidized, but the
Government has now agreed to remove the subsidy.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
28.       A report entitled "Appraisal of an Agricultural Development Proj-
ect in The Gambia" (PA-142 a) is being circulated separately. A Credit and
Project Summary is provided at- Annex III.
29.       The Government of The Gambia-has asked IDA to help finance an ir-
rigated rice project in its MacCarthy Island Administrative Division (MID).
A PMWA mission identified the project in February, 1969, and the FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program completed project preparation for the Government in
July, 1971. The project was appraised in February, 1972. Negotiations
took place from July 31 through August 1, 1972, with a delegation headed
by the Vice President of the Republic of The Gambia, Mr. Sheriff M. Dibba,
Ministry of Finance.
30.       The project proposed by the preparation mission included develop-
ing 6,500 acres of irrigated rice over four years at a cost of US$3.7 mil-
lion. During appraisal, a number of changes were made in agreement with
the Government's taking into account the Ministry of Agriculture's limited
ability to implement projects; the need for further experimental work in the
swamps area; the maximum use of existing facilities and services in the project,
as well as ongoing bilateral and UNDP technical assistance.
The Project
31.       The Project would have a two-fold objective.   First, it would
reduce The Gambia's present substantial rice imports by increasing the
local production of pump-irrigated rice. Second, it would prepare an in-
tegrated agricultural development project based on ongoing and additional
studies and on improved agricultural experimentation.



-7-
32.       The proposed credit would help finance:
(a) developing over a period of three years, 3,000 acres of
land in the MacCarthy Island Division (MID) of The Gambia
for double-cropping of rice under pump irrigation. Credit
would be provided for irrigation equipment as well as the
seed and fertilizer needed for the first crop. Field staff
would be trained and strengthened and staff housing con-
structed.
(b) preparation of a second phase integrated Agricultural Devel-
opmeht project in the MID through monitoring surveys. The
studies would include:
(i) identification of areas suitable for swamp rice
production, ground survey of selected swamps,
design of flood control works and related costs
estimates, and the implementation of such works
in one or two swamps to test designs;
(ii) improving agricultural experimental facilities at
Sapu for rainfed crops, swamp rice, and alterna-
tive crops for the present irrigated rice schemes;
and
(iii) preparing designs and cost estimates for a feeder
road system.
33.       The estimated project cost is US$1.5 million (net of taxes), with
a foreign exchange component of US$0.8 million or 55 percent of total cost.
The proposed IDA credit of US$1.3 million would finance 88 percent of total
project costs covering the foreign exchange component and 74 percent of the
local currency costs'. The remaining 12 percent of project costs, totalling..
US$0.18 million, would be met from Government budgetary allocations. As-
surances have been obtained during negotiations that funds for the Project
Management Unit (PMU) would be made available on a quarterly basis in order,
to maintain balances sufficient to meet expenditures expected in the follow-
ing three months.
Project Execution
34.       PMU within the Department of Agriculture will be in charge of
the project. Its manager, whose appointment is subject to approval by the
Association, will be responsible for all project operations and will co-
ordinate project activities with Government departments and technical assist-
ance agencies. He would be advised by a central committee made up of Govern-
ment representatives and the managing director of The Gambia Produce Marketing
Board (GPMB), under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Development. A
local committee chaired by the Commissioner of MID, and including divisional



-8-
Government officers and representatives of local farmers who would advise the
deputy manager responsible for daily project operations in the field and for
supervising ongoing extension activities of the Ministry of Agriculture in
MID during'the development period.
35.       An essential feature of the project would be to strengthen the
recently created rice-growing cooperatives. In the past, cooperatives have
been exclusively involved in the production of'grouindnuts. 'Cooperatives are
presently the only source of institutional credit. This channel would also
be used under the proposed project.
36.       A cooperative inspector, assigned'to the project by the Coopera-
tive Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, would assist the agricultural
assistants and demonstrators in creating and organizing rice-growing coopera-
tives; each cooperative would have at least twenty members and would include
all participants on a pumping scheme'site. Since cooperatives have suffered
recently from poor management, under the Cooperative Amendment Act: of 1968,
the Minister of Agriculture would appoint PMU staff members to cooperative
committees to assist with management until the new cooperatives prove com-
petent to run their own affairs. The PMU staff would organize the supply
and payment of seasonal inputs, the operation of the pumps and the delivery
of the crop to GPMB. 'The Cooperative would employ and pay for an agricul-
tural demonstrator who would perform the duties of Secretary of the coopera-
tives in his area. An auditor assigned to the project by the Cooperative
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture would audit cooperative accounts
annually.
Technical Assistance and Training
37.       A rice project was started in 1966 and, of 2,500 acres now under
cultivation, 1,700 acres are in MID. The Republic of China (Taiwan) provides
agronomists, engineers, extension workers, equipment and farm implements.
The project has been well supported by farmers; about 1,800 farmers
are involved in MID. Chinese participation In the proposed project would
assist its successful implementation. The Gambian Government is negotiating
a new agreement with the Republic of China for the renewal of the current
Technical'Assistance Cooperation and will seek agreement to second ten members
of the rice mission to the proposed project. The Government has assured the
Association that the new agreement will be effective in time for the proposed
project.
38.       The Ministry of Agriculture is handicapped by shortages of trained
Gambian staff and agricultural graduates. This is particularly serious for
the agricultural extension service, which employs only three Gambian grad-
uate officers and seven sub-professional officers; locally-trained techni-
cians (agricultural assistants) do most of the field work. Consequently,
the service lacks technical direction, particularly in the field.



-9-
39.       The above-mentioned Chinese technical assistance consisting of
30 rice specialists and technicians covers for the time being The Gambia's
most urgent requirements, and 10 of them would be adequate for the needs of
the proposed project. However, training arrangements for Gambians have to
be substantially stepped up if the Government is to be able to carry out the
much larger future projects associated with its diversification effort, such
as the ones being prepared under the proposed project. An amount of US$100,000
has therefore been included in the credit, which will allow 30 suitably quali-
fied candidates to obtain diploma level training in neighboring countries.
Gambia River Water Use
40.       The Gambia River is tidal for about 180 miles from its mouth, in-
cluding 80 miles in MID. Its catchment area is 30,000 square miles, of which
90 percent is outside The Gambia, in Senegal and Guinea. Records show an
average flow of about 1,000 cusecs 1/ at the beginning of the dry season, de-
clining to about 350 cusecs by the end of the dry season. Even at its lowest
flow, the river would more than meet present irrigation requirements of the
MID, as well as the additional irrigation proposed in this project (total
100 cusecs).
41.       The Government has informed the Bank that it will notify the
Governments of Guinea and Senegal about the proposed scheme and that it will
endeavor to reach an agreement with both countries for consultation prior
to any new project being carried out on the Gambia River bank. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory for the purposes of the proposed project.
Procurement and Disbursements
42.       International competitive bidding would be used to procure pumps,
vehicles, and equipment valuod at US$161,000. GPMB would supply fertilizers
and sprays valued at US$50,000, which would be procured together with The
Gambia's other fertilizer requirements according to competitive bidding pro-
cedures acceptable to the Association. Civil works, houses and offices valued
at US$155,900 would be carried out by PMU or the Ministry of Works by force
account. Consultant services totalling US$124,200 would be obtained under
the World Bank Group's normal procedures.
43.       Disbursement of the credit would be against 100 percent of the
c.i.f. cost of imported irrigation pumps, PMU vehicles and equipment, and of
consultant services (total US$285,000); 93 percent of staff salaries, al-
lowances and training,and civilkworks (total US$531,000); and 90 percent of
loans issued to farmers (total US$194,000) other than irrigation pumps. Con-
tingencies amounting to US$290,000 would be unallocated.
1/   One cusec represents a flow of one cubic foot (6-1/4 gallons) per second.



- 10 -
Benefits
44.       Project-induced rice production would be 5,000 tons (or 50 percent
of present imports) of milled rice by 1976. The development of pump irriga-
tion would provide fuller employment for 3,000 families and would increase
their annual income from US$270 to US$340. The economic rate of return is
estimated at 30 percent. Such-increased returns are adequate to attract
farmers to participate in the project as demonstrated by the ongoing scheme.
While the project would increase incomes per capita from US$45 to US$57,
beneficiaries would still have relatively low incomes compared with the
present per capita GDP of US$120.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
The Gambia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits for
Agricultural Development Projects.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

B.   Projects in Execution
The start of the project was delayed since rebidding was necessary
to comply with Bank procedures and design standards. It now appears that
the actual cost of the Port of Bathurst Project will substantially exceed the
cost estimates (US$2.1 million).
Bids were received in April 1971, and the lowest was 70 percent
above the appraisal report estimate. At the time, the higher costs were
thought to be the result of design changes made by the consultants without
consultation with the Association and the exclusion of Clause 69 FIDIC which
provides safeguards to the contractor in the event of default by the employer.
Accordingly, in September 1972, new bids were called for.
The bids received were, however, still in -excess of the appraisal,
report estimates, the lowest being 45 percent higher. Part of the increase
was accounted for by the substantial increase in the cost of the building
materials. Bids as warded exceeded original estimates by 45 percent or
US$840,000, and the Association has agreed in principle to consider a credit
to cover the increased foreign exchange cost of approximately US$600,000.
We expect to make proposals to the Executive Directors in the second half
of FY1973, when construction will have sufficiently advanced to allow a
definite estimate.
