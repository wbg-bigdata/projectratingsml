(CREDITS 896-RW AND 1344-RW)
PREfACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) covers the experience with
Credits 896-RW and 1344-RW, the second and third of a series of four lines of
credit to finance SSE development and other investment projects in Rvanda.
They were approved in 1979 and 1983 in the amounts of US$5.2 million and
SDR 6.5 million (equivalent at the time to US$7.0 million) respectively.
Disbursements under Credit 896-%W were completed in 1984 and under 1344-RW in
July 1989. A fourth credit, 1650-RW was approved in 1986, and is now 701
committed.   Both credits under review were made to the Government; the
financial intermediary channelling the proceeds to specific investment
projects vas the Banque Rwandaise de D6veloppement (BRD).
The PCR vas prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Di-ision
of the South Central and Indian Ocean Department of Africa, and is based on
information prepared by BRD and a review of Bank documents related to the
project. A Project Completion mission visited BRD during June 1989.
This PCR vas read by the Operations Evaluation Department.   The
draft PCR vas sent to the Borrower for comments; comments received from the
National Baok of Rwanda and BRD are reproduced as Attachments to the Report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND AND THIRD BANQUE RWANDAISE
DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BRDI PROJECTS
(CREDITS 896-RW AND 1344-RW)
EVALUATION SMRMARY
Ob1ectiveg
1.       IDA's objectives under the second and third credits were to support
the development of productive activities by providing foreign exchange
financing and to continue to strengthen BRD.   The second line of credit
(Credit 896-RW) was designed as a follow-up project emphasizing the
strengthening of the still young institution. It incorporated few changes in
BRD's policies or strategies.  The project had the additional objective of
assisting the government in undertaking a study to asseso the need for an
audit firm and to design a program for its establishment. The third line of
credit continued the institution-building efforts of the previous projects,
but it also had the objective of assisting in the development of small-scale
enterprises (SSEs) by providlng financing for a comprehensive study of the
sector and for a pilot program of lending. Under the third project, greater
emphasis was given to the analysis of subprojects, and the credit documents
included a requirement for a full economic analysis for non-service sector
subprojecte above the free limit (para. 1.03).
Im2lementation Exoerience
2.       With the exception of an interest rate issue, no major problems
arose during the execution of the two projects. BRD continued to expand and
became the largest source of investment financing in Rwanda. While commit-
ments and disbursements under the lines of credit were somewhat slower than
appraisal estimates, they were below Bank averages.  BRD co mitted US$4.45
million out of a total of the second line of credit of US$5.0 million for 17
projects in 2½ years, slower than the appraisal estimate of 1 years. The
credit was disbursed in 5 years, compared to the appraisal estimate of 4
years. Out of a total of SDR 6.4 million, BRD committed SDR 5.9 million for
44 projects over a period of two years,  in line with appraisal estimates,
and disbursed the funds in six years, six months longer than estimated at
appraisal (paras. 5.01 and 5.04). The main issue that arose related to the
Government's decision to reduce interest rates. BRD's believes that under
current arrangements, it has become uncompetitive with commercial banks and
is losing some of its better clients, and thus worsening its portfolio. This
matter will be reviewed by a financial sector mission which will visit Rwanda
soon (para. 2.12).
Results
3.       Considerable progress has been made towards strengthening BPD.  BRD
grew rapidly during the 1970s and early 1980s to become the leader for
providing term finance, initially to the industrial and service sectors, and
subsequently to agriculture. BRD continues to have a fairly solid financial
position and its policies and procedures have improved over the past five



vi -
years. BRD has in the past operated %ith a prudence that Is uncharacteristic
of development banks. However, its performance over the past year has been
disappointing, and BRD is facing growing operational, portfolio and financial
problems.  This trend to some extent reflects the difficulties inherent in
management changes, but also reflects a growing Government interference in
the operations  of BRD.   BRD is facing a serious resource problem
(para. 6.02).
4.       With regard to the objective of providing term financing to well-
conceived investment projects, the performance of enterprises financed under
the credit was below expectations. After the third credit, greater attention
has been paid to the economic analysis of projects, but this has become
increasingly complex because of the growing distortions in the economy over
which BRD has no control.  Experience at BRD indicates that most project
analysts find it difficult to understanAd and hence calculate economic rates
of return (para. 6.03).
5.       IDA contributed to providing a better policy framework for SSEs.
Many of the recommendations of the SSE study financed under the credit were
put in place.  Although the experience with the pilot program of lending
appears to have been generally disappointing, it is too early to tell what
the impact of this lending has been on the SSEs. BRD has contended, with
some justification, that the spreads on interest rates that it is allowed are
insufficient for small-scale lending, and the result has been that the small-
scale portfolio has not been properly supervised. BRD is now developing a
scheme whereby the small-scale portfolio will be supervised by other
governmeo-t agencies which have field offices (e.g., the Ministry of
Agriculture), which is an innovative solution. BRD has been very effective
in covering for the risks associated with small-scale lending. IDA did not
particularly focus its supervision work on the small-scale program, and the
successes and failures of the BRD program can largely be attributed to BRD
initiatives (para. 6.04).
Sustainabil_tv
6.       Rwanda has not begun its adjustment program and therefore, BRD's
portfolio has not yet been subjected to the twin blows of devaluation and
trade liberalization, which have caused financial distress to many
development banks. BRD might and should fare better than many in this regard
for a number of reasons: (i) its loans are denominated in local currency;
(ii) an important share of its portfolio is in agricultural projects; and
(iii) it has substantial provisions and equity capital to withstand the
blows. To the extent that it survives the expected adjustment in Rwanda, it
may proven more sustainable than other African DFC's.
Lessons Learned
7,       The single DPC approach taken in these operations has meant that IDA
has not been in a position to address issues affecting overall sector
performance, or the impact of the sector on the real economy. The findings
of this PCR confirm the need for a broader sectoral approach. While BRD has
developed as a sound institution, future assistance to the financial sector
should be through apex type operations, based on a good analysis of sectoral
issues and requirements, but only after the main macroeconomic issues are
resolved (para. 6.05).

SECOND AND THIRD BANQUE RWANDAISE
DE DEVELOPPEMENT LR_D) PROJECTS
(CREDITS 896-RW AND 1344-RW)
I. INTRODUCTiON
1.01     A PCR (Report No. 4921) preparod in 1984 chronicles the origins and
early development of BRD, and the experience with the Bank's first credit to
it. The PCR concluded that BRD had succeeded in establishing itself as a
strong institution, and the main support for development of the private
sector in Rwanda. The Report also concluded that the performance of enter-
p-.ses financed under the projecc had been below expectations, even though
BRD concentrated its lending on a few large projects, and that IDA would need
to maintain a close scrutiny over BRD operations, particularly when reviewing
subprojects, to ensure that IDA funds were used to the mximum benefit for
the country.
1.02     The Bank hae played a significant role in BRD's evolution over the
past 15 years, providing four credits (Nos. 655-RW, 896-RW, 1344-RW, and
1650-RW). The second line of credit was disbursed by 1984, while the last
disbursements for the third line of credit were made in August 1989. The
table below summarizes the terms and conditions of these two lines of credit.

1.03     Commitments and disbursements for the two credits proceeded somewhat
slower than anticipated, as discussed below, but well ahead of Bank averages
for this type of projects. Some US$0.72 million were cancelled from Credit
896-RW and SDR 0.456 million from Credit 1344-RW. The second line of credit
was designed as a follow-on project, emphasizing the strengthening of the
still young institution. It incorporated few changes in BRD's policies or
strategy. The principal changes dealt with increases in the onlending rates
and with the nature of guarantees for BRD loans. The project had the addi-
tional objective of assisting the Government in undertaking a study to assess
the need for an audit firm and to design a program for ite establishment.



2-
The third line of credit continued the institution-building efforts of the
previous projects, but it also had the objective of assisting in the develop-
ment of small-scale enterprises (SCEs) by providing financing for a compre-
hensive study of the sector and for a pilot program of lending. Under the
third project, greater emphasis was given to the analysis of subprojects, and
the credit documents included a requirement for a full economic anelysis,
including the calculation of an economic rate of return of non-service sector
subprojects above the US$200,000 free limit.
1.04     BRD continued to operate successfully in the first half of the
1980., and a fourth line of credit was approved by the Bank's Board on
January 14, 1986. Hciever, BID's performance detsriorated over the past few
years. Several factors played a role in that development. First, the sudden
death of the General Manager in 1986, the one year delay in the appointment
of his successor, and the substantial rotation of senior staff over the past
three yeare has had _n effect on efficiency and staff morale.  Second, the
distortions caused by the country's growing protectionism and currency over-
valuation make it increasingly difficult for BRD's relatively small project
evaluation team to identify and evaluate the soundness of projects. Third,
the growing sse portfolio, which, as expected, has turned out to be difficult
to supervise, has affected portfolio performance. Lastly, BID has been sub-
jected to increasing Govetiment interference in its operations, resulting in
part from the Government's desire to compensate for the effects of ths macro-
economic problems through increased public funding of investments.
1I. MACROECONOMIC AND SECTORAL SETTING
2.01     Despite the predominantly raral nature of its economy (41S of GDP
and 902 of foreign exchange earnings, mainly from coffee and tea), Rwanda has
relatively active service and industrial sectors. Services (excluding public
administration) and industrial activities now account for 262 and 172 of GDP,
respectively.
2.02     Throughout the 1970's Rwanda achieved considerable economic progress
while maintaining political stability. Largely because of the Government's
prudent economic management, good weather and favorable export prices, GDP
grew at an average annual rate of 62, inflation was kept low, and the country
maintained high foreign exchange reserves.  This growth was accompanied by
improvements in the living conditions of the population as reflected by such
indices as nutrition standards.
2.03     The economic situation deteriorated in the 1980s, with GDP growth
falling below population. growth. Real GDP fluctuated widely during 1981-87
as a result of erratic coffee prices and weather conditions with periods of
high growth (6Z in 1983 and over 42 in 1985-86) followed by sharp declines
(-42 in 1984, -32 in 1987 and -2.5 in 1988).
2.04     The recent economic downturn and growing financial difficulties
demonstrate the continued vulnerability of the Rwandese economy to develop-
ments in the coffee market. The growing problems have been exacerbated by
some of the policies followed by the Government over the past few years. The



- 3 -
Rwandese authorities expanded their public expenditure program during the
coffee boom period of the late seventies and did not reduce it when coffee
prices fell to lower levels in the 19809. As a result, large public deficits
developed which were financed by increased government borrowing, particularly
from domestic sources. The balance of payments also came under pressure, and
Rwanda had to draw down on its foreign exchange reserves tr finance the
external deficit.
2.05     The Government's response to the growing difficulties has been to
introduce restrictions on its exchange and trade regime which until the mid-
eighties was one of the most liberal in the region.   This move towards
controls has been reinforced by demands for higher protection from local
producers unable to compete with cheap imports resulting from the overvalua-
tion of the exchange rate.  There is a growing awareness that an exchange
rate adjustment is necessary to restore external equilibrium, but political
resistance to this policy option has been strong. With continued overvalu-
ation, there has been a need to reinforce controls (tariffs, quantitative
import restrictions and price controls) to protect foreign exchange reserves,
making Rwanda's exchange and trade system one of the more restrictive in the
region.
2.06     Financial Sector.   Rwanda's financial sector is fairly developed
considering the country's size and level of development.   It includes the
Central Bank, uhree commercial banks, a network of cooperative banks, a mort-
gage bank, a savings bank, a social security fund, two insurance companies
and BRD, the development bank. All institutions have headquarters in Kigali,
but some also have branches in the interior of the country. Total assets of
the financial system, excluding the Central Bank amounted to $635 million or
25S of GDP in 1987.   The banking sector (the commercial and cooperative
banks) accounted for 532 of the total; the social security fund for 231; BRD
for 8S, and the other non-bank financial institutions make up the remaining
16:.
2.07     Except for one commercial bank, one insurance company and the
cooperative banks, all other financial institutions are either owned outright
by the Government or have goveranent participation. The Goveranent doea. not
interfere in the operation of the two commercial banks where it holds &oome
501 of shares, and their management practices, procedures and policies
reflect those of their foreign shareholders which are European banks.
However, the Government is very much inrolved in the management and operation
of non-bank financial institutions, appointing their managers and senior
staff and controlling their Boards.
2.08     Until recently,  Rwandese financial institutions were highly
specialized, and little competition existed between them.   This situation
changed in 1987 when the Government passed legislation eliminating the
specialization in banking. Commercial bank lending is predominantly short-
term: foreign trade financing has traditionally accounted for 30-501 of their
income. However, medium-term lending has increased over the past few years
as the Central Bank allowed all term lending by commercial banks for priority
sectors to be placed outside individual bank ceilings.  However, long term
lending remains the domain of BRD.   The cooperative banks  (Banques
Populaires) are the fastest-growing financial institutions in Rwanda, and



- 4 -
provide most of the institutional credit in the rural areas, where borrowers
cannot meet the collateral requirements of commercial banks or do not require
the longer term, larger loans provided by BRD.
Main Sectoral Issues
2.09     In its fir -. vhree operations with BRD, the Bank had only narrow
institutional obje tAve-, although over the years, the Bank increasingly used
the BRD lines of          s e  - -i vehicles for discussions of sectoral issues.  The
Bank's ability to _ r-!-ence decisions on these issues has been limited. The
main sectoral issueo? addressed in the context of the projects were interest
rates, the promotion of small scale enterprises, the establishment of a local
audit firm, and more recently, the question of protection.
2.10     Interest Rates.   The Government has always wanted to use interest
rates as an instrument to encourage private investment, and to this end, has
favored low and differential rates. IDA sought to ensure that interest rates
were positive and to simplify BRD's multiple interest rate structure. The
dialogue on this issue led to positive interest rates, and contributed to the
reduction of the number of rates used by BRD.  Interest rates were raised
under the second credit to 8.5Z-102 for SSEs and 9X-11X for other projects.
During implementation of the second credit, BRD introduced differentiations
by term, sector and project profitability.   In connection with the third
credit, BRD agreed to (i) eliminate the financial rate of return as a
criterion for determining interest rates; (ii) not to give a preferential
interest rate to SSEs; (iii) to set and maintain positive interest rates in
real terms, and to review their level and structure at least once a year; and
(iv) to carry out a study on interest rates in Rwanda with the objective of
rationalizing their structure. During the commitment period of the second
and third IDA credits, BRD complied with the understandings reached with IDA.
The study on interest rates was completed in 19841 it concluded that interest
rates were high because of the decline in the inflation rate.
2.11     Under the fourth line of credit (Cr. 1650-RW), BRD agreed to review
the level and structure of rates at least once a year to ensure that they
remain positive in real terms. Two interest rates were set: for "productive"
sectors (12.52) and for services (13.5X).   In July 1987, the Government
decreed a reduction of the maximum interest rates that commercial banks can
charge to 9X for priority sectors and 9X-122 for other sectors, although the
maximum rates were not legally binding for BRD.  After consultation with IDA,
BRD reduced interest rates for projects financed under the fourth line of
credit.   However, BRD also reduced interest rates on 13 subloans financed
under Cr. 1344-RW without IDA's consent, and as a result, IDA suspended new
commitments under Credit 1650-RW. The suspension was lifted in July 1988,
after the Government and BRD agreed on a number of steps that would ensure
that the change in interest rates would not affect BRD's profitability.
These included a requirement that BRD amend the credit agreements with
clients benefitting from the reduced interest rates to enable BRD to increase
interest rates if the rates charged by other intermediaries increase in the
future.
2.12     BRD is facing increasing competition from other financial institu-
tions in its lending to its older and more established clients. This is the



result of the 1987 legislation (pars. 2.08 above) which eliminated the
specialization of financial institutions.   As a result, one of the loans
funded under the third line of credit was prepaid in 1989, and other good
clients are also expected to refinance their loans. BRD plans to establish a
penalty for the accelerated prepayment of loans when this prepayment is the
result of a refinancing operation.   The issue of interest rates will be
reviewed in the context of a financial sector study vhich IDA will carry out
in the second half of FY90. The study will take into account the exchange
rate situation. The study is in response to a 1987 request from the Central
Bank which is considering a number of reforms to the financial system.
2.13     SSEs.   Through its lending, the Bank contributed to focus BRD's
attention on SSEs. By the early eighties, the importance of SSEs was recog-
nized in the Government's development pl4ns, although no program had been
developed to assist them. BRD resisted financing them because of the risks
and costs associated with lending to small enterprises. Under the third line
of credit, funds were allocated to finance a study of the constraints to
small enterprise development in Rwanda, and for a pilot program of lending by
BRD. The study was completed in 1984, and incorporated a number of recommen-
dations on ways to improve the regulatory environment for SSEs, especially
through modifications in the investment code. Most of the changes proposed
have been introduced.
2.14     The Bank assisted in improving the operations of a Special Guarantee
Fund which had been established by the Government to encourage bank lending
to SSEs with a 1OZ annual levy on the profits of commercial banks, although
IDA had not originally encouraged its establishment.  Because of the reluc-
tance of commercial banks to enter the sector and deficiencies in the Fund's
procedures, only a few small loans benefitted from it in its early years of
operation.   Under the fourth credit, the Government agreed to amend the
policies and procedures of the Fund to improve its usefulness.   BRD was
extremely concerned about the effect on its profitability of the small-scale
program, and to ensure that it was protected, it set up in 1982 a separate
guarantee fund financed with repayments from RlW loans.  The Government's
Special Guarantee Fund is now operational, and a number of BRD operations
were guaranteed through this fund over the past two years. The existence of
the Funds has enabled BRD to obtain guarantees for most of its small-scale
portfolio. Because the guarantee funds eliminated BRD's concerns regarding
its profitability, the difficulties that BRD has faced in supervising its SSE
portfolio never became a critical issue with BRD or the Bank.
2.15     Audit Firm.  The second credit included a component to help the
Government finance a study on the feasibility of establishing an auditing
firm in Rwanda.  The credit also included financing of technical assistance
for the establishment of the firm.  The study, prepared by Price Waterhouse
International, concluded that, to be successful, an audit firm in Rwanda
should be equipped to resolve the problem of the weakness of enterprise
accounts which is the most important problem to be addressed, and would
require substantial subsidies from Government in its first years of opera-
tion.   When the report came out, the EEC agreed to provide financing to
strengthen accounts of public enterprises, and the audit firm was never
established.



2.16    Macroeconomic Framework.  As Rwanda had a fairly liberal trade and
exchange system at appraisal time, general macroeconomic issues were not
addressed under the second and third lines of credit. The subject vas exten-
sively discussed in connection with the fourth line of credit, and the Bank
asked the Government to prepare a timetable for implementation of the recom-
mendations of a study on import reform which it was to carry out. Although
the study was carried out, the Government never introduced reforms aimed at
liberalizing the trade regime. Instead, the tariff structure was revised in
1987, and both the level of tariffs and their dispersion were increased. In
addition, as a result of the shortage of foreign exchange and the apprecia-
tion of the exchange rate, the import licensing system, which had existed,
but was not applied, was made more restrictive. Given the lack of progress
of both macroeconomic and trade policy issues, IDA has not initiated prepara-
tion of a follow-up to the fourth line of credit in spit) of BRD and Govern-
ment requests.
III. THE INSTITUTION
3.01     Ownership.   BRD's ownership structure did not change during the
1983-1988 period. The subscribed capital remained unchanged at RwY 1.1 bil-
lion (US$13 million).  The Rwandese public sector holds 551 of shares (the
minimaum required by BRD statutes); the remainder are held by private local
shareholders (about 12S) and by foreign shareholders (321). Although seven
of the 13 members of BRD's Board represent public sector institutions, the
Board has operated independently. BRD is seeking a sixth capital increase of
RwF 600 million which it expects its shareholders to approve in early 1990.
3.02    Manatement and Ortanization.   BRD traditionally has been well
managed, and management has been stable. It has had four General Directors
since its inception.   The General Director from 1982-86 was a highly
respected commercial banker who was instrumental in the institution's growth.
After his death in 1986, the Government appointed, after a one year delay,
Mr. Emanuel Ndahimana, a known public figure who had been Rwanda's Executive
Director at the African Development Bank. BRD has successfully operated with
little technical support from outside the institution. The limited external
assistance it has received has been of high quality. Most technical assis-
tance has been provided by the Government of Belgium and by the UNDP, which
is funding an ongoing computerization program.   Under the computerization
program each staff member is receiving substantial training in the use of
microcomputers.  In addition, some staff has been sent to Europe for prac-
tical training.
3.03     Organizational questions were not an issue during the appraisal and
supervision of the second and third credits. The new management cf BRD has
introduced a number of changes in the organization during the past two years
with which IDA was not associated.1  The principal changes included the
establishment of a portfolio section in the Finance Department, and the reor-
ganization of the appraisal unit, which used to be divided into small-scale
1/ A consultant financed by the UNDP made recommendations on organization and
human resources in 1987.



- 7 -
and large projects, into sectoral units. Under the new structure the large
loans are being reviewed by the same team that is reviewing the small-scale
portfolio, which requires limited evaluation skills but considerable staff
input because of their number. An important drawback of the reorganization
is that it was associated with a rotation of key personnel. In some cases,
the incumbents are less qualified than their predecessors.  The reorganiza-
tion had an especially severe effect on the portfolio section, where the
quality of information kept has deteriorated sharply.
3.04     Staffint and Trainina.   BRD staff increased from 80 (35 profes-
sional) in 1983 to 108 (34 professional) at the end of 1988. The staff is in
general competent, although, as mentioned before, there appears to have been
a deterioration of staff morale.   Staff turnover has been generally low,
although in recent years BRD has lost some key experienced staff.  In the
past, trairing has been done mostly on the job, and there has not been a
comprehensive staff training program.   The Government's desire to use only
grants for training may make it difficult for BRD to obtain independent
advice in setting up a program to meet the growing need for specialized
training.
3.05    0teratine Policies.   In general, BRD has developed good operating
policies and procedures, although there appears to have been a relaxation of
procedures over the past year with the pressure to increase lending. At the
recommendation of its largest shareholders, BRD has recruited Helios (France)
to carry out a Portfolio Audit which will also give recommendations on
measures to improve operating procedures.   The quality of appraisals and
supervision and the assistance which BRD was to provide to small enterprises
were the principal issues raised during project implementation.  At project
appraisal, there was also a concern over BRD's exposure in large projects.
These issues are discussed below. BRD has its accounts audited by an inde-
pendent auditing firm, and has been in compliance with IDA requirements,
except for 1985 and 1988, when the audits were late.
Main Institutional Issues
3.06     Technical Assistance to SSEs.   In the discussions on lending to
SSEs, it was anticipated that BRD would need to promote and provide assis-
tance to the SSE clients beyond that given to its larger clients. BRD has
argued that it cannot supervise the portfolio with the current spreads
(5X-7%), especially since it does not have a regional network. BRD did try
to tackle partially the problem of SSE lending and its impact on its finances
by establishing a regional office in Gikongoro and by ensuring that its
small-scale portfolio is adequately guaranteed. However, in practice, it has
found it difficult to supervise its SSE portfolio, especially in the
provinces.   Realizing the difficulties it faces, BRD is now arranging for
other governmental agencies which have staff in the regions to supervise and
provide technical assistance to BRD clients, which could provide the solution
to this growing problem.   Greater attention would need to be given in the
future to the cost of supervising and providing technical assistance to SSE
projects.
3.07     Ouality of AnRraisals.  The quality of project appraisals improved
during the implementation of the second and third lines of credit, partly as
a result of the technical assistance provided by Bank superv' ton missions,



- 8 -
which emphasized its importance.   Under the third line of credit, IDA
required BRD to calculate economic rates of return for all non-service sector
subprojects with a total cost of more than $200,000, a requirement which was
also included in the fourth line of credit. More recently, the quality of
appraisals has been affected by the difficulties of analysis resulting from
the macroeconomic distortions, the unprogrammed expansion of activities in
1988 and the loss of experienced staff in appraisals.   Appraisal work is
weakest in the areas of economic analysis and market forecasting. In an
attempt to address project evaluation problems, BRD, with UNDP financing,
organized in 1990 a seminar on project evaluation.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.01     Operations.    BDD's annual approvals increased from about RwF 501
million in 1983 to RwF 735 million in 1987 and RwF 1,724 in 1988. Of the
total approvals in 1988, RwF 194 million were to honor supplier credit
guarantees which had been given in earlier years and RvF 442 million were
loans to existing clients. Annex 1 shows BRD's approvals, commitments and
disbursements (actual and projected) for the 1983-88 period. Until 1987, BRD
approvals were lower than forecasted at the time of credit appraisals. Until
1987, commitments and disbursements lagged considerably behind approvals, and
represented 66X and 721 of appraisal forecasts for the 1983-87 period. The
main reasons for the lower than expected volume of operations in the 1983-87
period included BRD's cautiousness, delays of clients in meeting BRD's dis-
bursement conditions, difficulties in project execution, insufficient
sponsors' contributions and delays in securing approval from external
creditors. The situation changed markedly in 1987-88, when BRD attempted to
accelerate the pace of its operations as a result of Government pressure.
The acceleration, which was largely unprograsmed, has had an adverse effect
on the quality of appraisals and supervision.
4.02     In 1983-1988, lending to agriculture and industrial activities
increased at the expense of the financing of transport equipment and
services, as demonstrated by the distribution of the outstanding portfolio.
(531 of the outstanding portfolio in 1983, compared to 881 in 1988).  The
share of the regions in total approvals increased in the 1983-87 period,
although there remains a heavy concentration in Kigali which accounts for
about 801 of approvals. Lending to small-scale enterprises increased rapidly
between 1983 and 1987, but represented a declining share of total activities,
a trend that was reversed in 1988. In 1988, BRD responded to the Govern-
ment's pressure to increase lending by more than tripling its approvals for
small-scale projects. Annex 2 shows BRD approvals by size.
4.03     Portfolio.   At the end of December 1988, BRD's outstanding loan
portfolio amounted to REF 3.6 billion (about US$44 million) for 268 projects.
Equity investments totalled RwF 0.7 billion (about US$8 million).   Loan
arrears of more than one month represented 12.91 of the portfolio out-
standing, compared to 4.61 in 1983. In spite of the growing portfolio prob-
lems, the portfolio information kept by BRD has deteriorated sharply.  BRD
has been unable to provide information on the age of arrears, data which it
used to be able to produce regularly for Bank supervision missions.   The



portfUlio affected by arrears of over one month, which is the only informa-
tion available, has increased over the period, and at the end of 1988, it
represented more than 322 of the total portfolio outstanding, which is fairly
high.   The deterioration of the portfolio in the early eighties was due
largely to the poor performance of two large projects, SOMIRWA and RWAKINA,
which in 1985 represented 14% of the portfolio outstanding. SOMIRWA is now
out of the portfolio, and BRD plans to take the losses for RWAKINA in the
current year. The increase in the importance of the small-scale portfolio,
where collections are low, has affected performance more recently. The SSE
portfolio, which was small at the beginning of the period, accounted for 7S
of the outstanding balances in December 31, 1988. Collections of principal
(the only information available by size of project) represented 431 of prin-
cipal called during the year for the small-scale portfolio, while it repre-
sented 93% of the principal called for the large-scale portfolio.
4.04     Collections as a percent of =ounts due fell in the early eighties
as a result of problems with SOMIRWA and RWAKINA. Collections improved in
1985-87, and were higher than the requirements under Credit 1650-RW.
Improvements in collections reflect primarily payments resulting from the
sale of assets of the SOMIRWA project. Collections in 1988, when SOMIRWA was
no longer in the portfolio, accounted for 96% of amounts due. Annex 3 con-
tains information on the performance of BRD's portfolio.
Collections as a Percent of Amounts Due
1983       1984       1985       1986       1987       1988
95         89         109       128        114          96
4.05     BRD has made adequate provisions in the past, although these have
been declining at a time when the portfolio may be deteriorating. While the
coverage ratio in 1986 was 2361, this had fallen to 931 in 1988. As mentioned
elsewhere in this Report, the increased protectionism has made it difficult
to estimate the economic benefits of projects.   There is thus a need to
assess the quality of BRD's portfolio and to determine how it would perform
under different macroeconomic policies.   This will help BRD design an
appropriate risk policy.
4.06     Financial Condition.  Annexes 4 to 6 show BRD's projected and actual
balance sheets, income statements and ratio analyses for the period 1983-88.
BRD's total assets increased from RwF 2.9 billion in 1983 to RwP 4.7 billion
in 1988, and were in general below the appraisal teams' estimates (except for
1988 when assets increased by 211 because of the expansion of approvals).
Profitability was low, primarily because of the poor performance of the port-
folio which required high provisions expenses. BRD profits averaged 0.71 of
average total assets during the period, compared to the appraisal estimate of
1.41. While the appraisal team had estimated that bad debt provisions for
the period would amount to about 2.31 of average assets, actual provision
expenses amounted to 4.21 of average assets.   Spreads were higher than
appraisal estimates, averaging 9% of average assets in 1983-86 (compared to
appraisal estimates of 7.81) because BRD received concessionary financing



- 10 -
from several sources, but fell to 7.42 in 1987-88 as a result of the 1987
reduction in interest rates.   Until 1988, BRD maintained a reasonable
liquidity, a situation which was reversed in 1988 as disbursements
accelerated. At the end of 1988, BRD's term debt to equity ratio was 0.9:1,
vell within the 3:1 limit required under IDA's credits.
4.07     Resource Position.  In the 1983-88 period, BRD has been relatively
successful in mobilizing external resources for its foreign currency lending
requirements, receiving the equivalent of about RwF 3 billion in new lines of
credit. In addition to IDA's fourth line of credit, BRD received financing
from the African Development Bank (RyP 1.6 billion equivalent), the CCCE (the
equivalent of RvF 260 million) and the European Investment Bank (the
equivalent of RwF 414 million). BRD expects that its sixth capital increase
will be finalized early next year. BRD has now decided to raise resources in
the local market, but it is too early to tell how successful it will be.
4.08     Although BRD has raised funds from a number of sources, it is facing
serious resource constraints, and at the end of 1988, it had a resource gap
of RwF 697 million. Because disbursements in 1988 were higher than antici-
pated, BRD was forced to borrow short-term from commercial bsnks and -he
Central Bank to meet its obligations.   The commercial bank credits were
refinanced by the Central Bank in early 1989.  Of the amounts discussed in
para. 4.06 above,  *ome RvF 1.9 billion have just been contracted.   B2D
expects that ADB will allow it to refinance some of its past operations with
its new line of credit, and that the Central Bank will convert its short term
loan into long term financing. BRD is mobilizing resources from the EEC, ADB
and the CCCE.   However, BRD is expected to continue to face liquidity
problems.
V. ALLOCATION OF THE CREDITS
Credit 896-RW
5.01     BRD committed US$4.45 million for 17 projects.   The credit was
committed in 2½ years, slower than the appraisal estimate of 1½ years, but
faster than the Bank average. The commitment date was extended once. The
appraisal estimate seems to have been based on the performance under the
first line of credit when commitments were completed in one year, primarily
because only six very large projects were funded under IDA's line of credit.
The credit was disbursed in 5 years, compared to the appraisal estimate of 4
years, and also below the Bank average. The bulk of disbursements was made
in the last year. Six of the 17 subloans approved under the line of credit
were above the free limit. IDA's share in the financing varied between 302
and 70%. Two of the subloans, for vehicle repair facility and for a ware-
housing facility accounted for 40% of the commitments under the credit.
Interest rates charged on the subloans ranged from 8.5%, to 11% (as per the
interest rate covenant), and maturities ranged from 6 to 12 years, including
grace periods.
5.02     Annexes 7 and 9 summarize the key characteristics of the subprojects
financed under the line of credit. Most of the subprojects were located in

Kigali.   Ten projects were in the manufacturing sector (inol-: .ng agro-
industry), 5 were in the service sector, and 2 were in tourism.    .jects in
the manufacturing sector were for import substitution activities.   As of
December 31, 1988, fifteen of the projects were operational and two had
failed. The failed projects were two gas service stations in the province of
Byumba. Of the 15 projects under operation, 8 have repaid their loans, 7 are
servicing their loans regularly, and one (a free limit subproject) is facing
difficulties in meeting its obligations with BRD. The projects have created
some 500 jobs at an average cost per job of about US$11,600, which is lower
than under the first line of credit, although it is still high.
5.03     Of the six large projects (above the free limit), five are operating
at a profits only the Government-owned Imprimerie Nationale de Rwanda (INR)
is showing a low profitability (subloan accounts for 19% of total commitments
under the IDA Credit).   The major problems with this project have been
managerial. The return on investment for the large projects ranges between
6Z and 36Z.  BRD calculated ex-ante financial rates of return for all sub-
projects, and these ranged from 12% to 50% (for La Rwandaise), but has not
provided ex-post rates of return.  BRD did not calculate economic rates of
return for most subprojects (it was not a requirement under the credit), and
since the projects have only been in operation since the early eighties, it
would be difficult to calculate ex-post rates of return.
Credit 1344-RW
5.04     BRD committed SDR 5.94 million of a total of SDR 6.4 million for 44
projects over a period of two years (SDR 0.1 million was allocated to
studies).   The appraisal had estimated commitments in two years.   IDA
extended the commitment authority only once for one year, and SDR 0.456 were
cancelled. The Credit was disbursed over five years, in line with appraisal
estimates. Seven of the 44 subloans were over the free limit of US$200,000.
Eight of the total number of loans approved were for large projects, and the
remaining 36 were for small-scale enterprises (defined as enterprises with
net assets of less than 15 million RwF and less than 30 employees).   The
eight subloans for large projects accounted for 84X of total commitments, and
ranged in size from SDR 108 thousand to SDR 1.4 million (for a hotel).  The
subloans for small enterprises were much smaller, ranging in size from SDR
4.6 thousand to SDR 78 thousand. IDA's share in the financing varied between
25% and 70X.  Interest rates charged on the subloans varied between 9% and
11X.
5.05     Annexes 8 and 9 summarize the characteristics of the subprojects
financed under the line of credit.  Of the eight large subprojects, five were
in the manufacturing sector (including agro-industry), two were in tourism (a
hotel) and one was an agricultural project.   All the large projects were
located in the Kigali Region.   The bulk of the small-scale projects (26
operations) were in the agricultural sector, 4 were in manufacturing activi-
ties, and the remaining were in services and transport.  The small scale-
projects were located throughout Rwvnda, in line with the objectives of the
IDA credit. All projects were in the private sector. The average cost per
job of 6 of the 8 large subprojects Cor which information was available was
about US$13,000. The cost per job of a sample of 12 SSE projects which are
still in operation was about US$4,900.

5.06     BRD calculated ex-ante financial rates of return for all sub-
projects, and these ranged from 202 to 452, but has not provided ex-post
rates of return.   BRD calculated economic rates of return for the large
projects in the manufacturing sector. Since the projects have only been in
operation for a few years, it would be difficult to calculate ex-post rates
of return. However, some of import substitution projects such as Anik Rwanda
and Rubangura (together accounting for some 142 of total commitments under
the Credit) have low domestic value added and probably low economic zates of
return.
5.07     All of the large projects are still in operation.   One of them,
Ranch Mpala, has faced serious difficulties from the outset, and the loan for
it is wow being serviced by La Rwandaise, which owns it. Difficulties with
the project included poor management, and market and marketing problems. In
addition, it appears that La Rwandaise used some of BRD's funds to finance
the importation of vehicles for the commercial side of its operations. CRHT,
the hotel company that owns the Mille Collines Hotel in Kigali has faced
financial difficulties over the past two years because it engaged in an
ambitious expansion program (beyond that financed under the IDA credit).
Although the Bralirwa project had substantial cost overruns, the company
continues to be profitable. All of the l&rge projects are servicing their
loans regularly.
5.08     Experience with the small scale enterprise projects was disap-
pointing, although this is not entirely surprising since IDA's project was a
pilot program and the first experiment in small-scale lending for BRD. Of
the 36 SSEs projects financed under IDA's line of credit, 15 or some 402 are
no longer in operation. These projects account for about one third of com-
mitments for small-scale enterprise projects. Most of the SSE projects were
guaranteed by the BRD guarantee fund, with the result that BRD will not
sustain serious losses from the performance of this portfolio.  Of the 21
SSEs still in operation, 4 have repaid their loans, 12 are repaying on
schedule and the balance (5 projects) have been classified as facing payment
problems. The principal reasons for project failure were managerial problems
which could have probably been identified at appraisal.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01     IDA's main objectives under the second and third IDA credits  were
to support the development of productive activities by providing foreign
exchange financing, and to continue to strengthen BRD.   Under the third
credit, IDA also sought to assist in the development of SSEs by helping BRD
implement a pilot program for financing SSE projects and by financing a study
to develop a nationwide program of support to SSEs.
6.02     Considerable progress has been made towards strengthening BRD. BRD
grew rapidly during the 1970s and early 1980s to become the leader for
providing term finance, initially to the industrial and service sectors, and
subsequently to agriculture. BRD continues to have a fairly solid financial
position and its policies and procedures have improved over the past five
years. BRD has in the past operated with a prudence that is uncharacteristic



- 13 -
of development banks. However, its performance over the past year has been
disappointing, and BRD is facing growing operational, portfolio and financial
problems.   This trend reflects the deterioration of the macroeconomic
environment, the difficulties inherent in management changes, and also a
growing Government interference in the operations of BED. BRD is facing a
serious resource problem.
6.03     With regard to the objective of providing term financing to well-
conceived iavestment projects, the performance of enterprises financed under
the credit was below expectations. After the third credit, greater attention
has been paid to the economic analysis of projects, but this h6s become
increasingly complex because of the growing distortions in the economy. BRD
obviously has no control over the economic environment, but needs to be aware
of the impact of policies on its projects.   The economic evaluation of
projects, if properly carried out  provides this assessment. Hdoever, experi-
ence indicates that most project analysts find it difficult to understand and
hence calculate economic rates of return. In addition to having an ongoing
training program on the economic aspects of project evaluation (staff leaves
as soon as it is trained), it might be useful to devise simplified methods
for determining the viability of projects. Possibilities include raising the
minimum acceptable financial rate of return or to calculate financial rates
of return using international prices.
6.04     IDA contributed to providing a better policy framework for SSEs.
Many of the recomendations of the SSE study financed under the credit were
put in place.   Although the experience with the pilot program of lending
through BRD was disappointing, it is too early to tell what the impact of
lending in SSEs has been. BRD has contended, with some justification, that
the spreads on interest rates that it is allowed are insufficient for small-
scale lending, and the result has been that the small-scale portfolio has not
been properly supervised. BRD is now developing a scheme whereby the small-
scale portfolio will be supervised by other government agencies which have
field offices (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture), which is an innovative
solution. BRD has been very effective in covering for the risks associated
with small-scale lending.   IDA did not particularly focus its supervision
work on the small-scale program, and the successes and failures of the BRD
program can largely be attributed to BRD initiatives.
6.05     The single DFC approach taken in these operations has meant that IDA
has not been in a position to address issues affecting overall sector per-
formance, or the impact of the sectjr on the real economy. The findings of
this PCR confirm the need for a broader sectoral approach. While BRD has
developed as a sound institution, future assistance to the financial sector
should be through apex type operations, based on a good analysis of sectoral
issues and requirements, and only after the main macroeconomic issues are
resolved.

TOLIRWA
Subloan: US$970,000
Location: Kigali
-The subproject aimed at establishing a new plant to process corru-
gated iron sheets with inputs imported from Japan. BID's initial request
was for a subloan of US$924,000 (352 of total project cost) which IDA
approved in September 1979.  As funds remaining In CR. 655-RW were not
sufficient to finance the whole subloan, US$280,000 were approved under
Cr. 896-RU. Implementation of the project experienced delays and resulted
in a cost overrun of US$326,000 which BRD requested and IDA agreed to cover
with funds cancelled under another subproject. The project started opera-
tion in June 1980, exceeding the production estimates made at appraisal.
Its production costs were higher than estimated at appraisal. At the
outset, the project enjoyed little protection and incurred substantial
losses. Toliwa obtained the suspension of iron sheet imports in 1982, and
is now operating at a profit, although the local product is considerably
more costly than imp :rts.  About one third of TOLIRWA's production is sold
to persons who then export the sheets to Uganda and eastern Zaire.
LA RWANDAISE
Subloan: US$750,500
Location: Kigali
The project consisted of the construction of new premises for "La
Rwandaise" which sells and repairs Toyota and Mercedes cars, pick-ups,
mini-buses, and trucks. BRD also took an equity participation in the com-
pany, which until then had been wholly foreign-owned.   The project was
implemented without major difficulties sod the company has operated at a
profit, although these have declined over the past two years when there
have been import restrictions which have reduced revenues on the distribu-
tion side of operations.
MAGASINS GENERALES DE RUANDA (MAGERWA)
Subloan: US$1.2 million
Locations Kigali
The project consisted of the expansion of the customs bonded ware-
house of Magasins Generaux du Rwanda. The project consisted of the con-
struction of a new warehouse, an office building, eating facilities for
truckers and a parking lot. Uagerva has the monopoly of bonded warehousing
in Rvanda, and operates profitably. The subloan is fully repaid.

IMPRIMBRIE NATIONALE DU RWANDA (INR)
Subloant US$879,417
Location: Kigali
The project consisted of the expansion and modernization of the
Government's printing facilities in Kigali. It included the construction of
a second printing workshop, acquisition of offset printing equipment and
training of personnel. The project was initially approved by BRD in 1979,
but there were serious difficulties in the procurement of the necessary
machinery, which delayed the project and resulted in cost overruns. These
were partly financed by BRD.  IDA refinanced both the original and the
second loan.  INR has faced serious management problems since the beginning
and is operating at a loss. BRD's loan was guaranteed by the Government,
which serviced the loan.
RWANDA FOAM
Subloan: US$435,000
Location: Kigali
The project consisted of the establishment of a factory to produce
foam rubber mattresses.  The project began operations in 1983.  It faced
serious problems at the outset due to disagreements between the owners, a
problem which has been resolved. The project was overdesigned, an issue
which was identified by the Bank at appraisal, and is currently operating
at about 15S capacity. Nonetheless, because of the high transport costs of
mattresses, the company is operating at a profit. About 20S of its output
is sold to traders who export the mattresses to eastern Zaire and Uganda.
SUIFORWANDA
Subloan: US$593,000
Location: Kigali
Sulfo-Rwanda is the main soap and detergent manufacturer in
Rwanda.   It has now diversified into the production of candy. The sub-
project was designed to help finance the purchase of two-tank trucks and
the construction and installation of 18 tanks with a total storage capacity
of 1,950 tons to enable Sulfo to import in bulk and store fatty acids. The
project was completed on time. Sulfo has consistently operated profitably,
although some of its products are protected. All of the raw materials are
imported and there is little domestic value added in many of its product
ones. Sulfo exported to Uganda and Zaire, but has found it increasingly
difficult to compete due to the overvalued exchange rate.  Some of its
cosmetic lines suffer from competition from Kenyan products, which are
smuggled into Rwanda.

BRALIMW
Subprojects SDR 996,200
Locations Kigali
Established in 1983, Bralirwa is the largest industrial firm and
the largest producer of beer and soft drinks in Rwanda. The capital is 70S
held by Heineken, and the Government holds the reaoining 30X. The company
is well managed and profitable. The project financed the installation of a
new line with a nominal capacity of 20,000 bottles of soft drinks per hour
to replace an old line which was fully depreciated and insufficient to meet
the demand, even operating at full capacity. The project had substantial
overruns due to the underestimation of the costs of assembly of the equip-
ment. Although there was insufficient information to update the calcula-
tions on the rate of return, it is very likely that the project continues
to have a strong justification.
RANCH DE MPANGA
Subproject: SDR 556,600
Location: Kigali
The project consisted of the purchase and fattening of cattle for
the domestic market and exports, and a small component for the raising of
wild animals.  The subloan financed the foreign exchange cost of the con-
struction of a slaughterhouse, cattle sheds, a clinic, warehouses and
related facilities. The project was sponsored by la Rwandaise, an important
commercial enterprise in which BID held 71 ownership and which has the
licence for the Import of Toyota and Mercedes as well as auto repairs and
insurance. Most of the facilities were not constructed, and the project
suffered from the beginning from inadequate management. The market for the
products was inadequately assessed. The project incurred heavy losses from
the outset, and the debt is being serviced by la Rwandaise out of its com-
mercial activities.
SOCIETE DE PRODUCTION D'ALIMENT POUR LE BETAIL (SOPA_)
Subprojectt SDR 485,000
Locations Kigali
The project, which aims to produce animal feed, was promoted by
the government, which has taken a nominal participation (42) on the share
capital. BRD took an equity position in the project. The loan financed
civil works and equipment for the factory. All raw materials used in the
production process are imported.  SOPAB began operations in August 1988.

The working capital requirements were underestimated at appraisal and BRD
was required to make a vorking capital loan in 1989. The company had a
small profit in the first year of operations.
ANIK RWANDA
Subproject: SDR 108,500
Location: Kigali
The project consisted of the establishment of a fully integrated
production of hygienic tissues, the raw material of which (cellulose) would
be imported in large bobbins.   The production process includes the
packaging in sizes currently sold in Rwanda.   The project vas completed
substantially within appraisal estimate costs. The project has benefited
from high nominal protection and has little domestic value aeded.  Anik
Rwanda is an integrated company producing other products, so it is impos-
sible to determine the profitability of the line fiuanced under the
project. Anik has consistently shown profits.
SOCIETE GENERALE DE PETROLES (SGP)
Subproject: SDR 416,100
Locations
SOP imports and distributes petroleum products in Rwanda.  The
project included construction of the administrative building, a storage
tank for petroleum, lubricants and a service station, all located in the
Kigali lndustrial park.  The project was completed on time and vithin
costs.   SGP initially envisaged that all the distribution would be done
through the station in Kigali, but as this proved too limiting, it reached
agreements with other companies to distribute products which could not be
sold out of its Kigali station.   SGP has since built a network of 45
stations throughout the country, and is now one of the three important
petroleum distributors in Rwanda. SGP has consistently shown profits.
MOTEL-RESTAURANT NDASIDGWA
Subprojects 8DR 184,400
Locations Kigali
The project consists of the construction of a restaurant, a ten
room motel and a bar/nightclub. The project suffered substantial delays
and costs were double those estimated at appraisal. Because of the cost
overruns, the promoter had initial difficulties servicing its debt to BRD,
which rescheduled its loan in 1987. The project is operating successfully
now.   In 1988, the promoter repaid its BRD loan with cheaper financing
obtained from Banques Populaires.

Mr. George C. Maniatis

Subject: Proiect Completion ReRort on Credits 896-RW and 1344-RW
Dear Sir:
We have received your letter of April 20. 1990 enclosing the PCR
on the Second and Third Development Banking Projects.
WJe are most surprised that the observations forwarded to you in
our letter of July 27, 1989 have not been included in what seems to be the
final report, since you have sent it to a number of agencies in Rwanda;
consequently, we wonder whether the comments which follow will be taken into
account.
At the risk of repetition, we must state that in our viev the
report's general assessment of the operations and management of the BRD is
superficial and often based on superfluous and even inappropriate
considerations.
Like you, we regret the disappearance of Mr. Mugaragu shortly
after his brief stay at the World Bank; nonetheless, to resurrect this matter
during an assessment of the BRD's work is irrelevant and the reference should
be eliminated.
We have also identified paragraphs founded on contacts and rumors
that pervade Kigali but which World Bank staff should treat very cautiously,
or at le-st try to verify before including them in a report of this kind.
Your institution's opinions ought to be based on objective circumstances and
marked solely by professionalism.
You also have an audit that each year sends you a report on the
management of the BRD. The consultants whom you yourselves -hose have never
referred to bad management or to any sort of irregular practices.
In addition, references to staff morale can only lead to
subjective conclusions. The General Director's office is well placed to know
that during 1988 and 1989 BRD personnel made exceptional efforts in a

projects with what you call unqualified staff it is because they have at least
been willing to work hard and surpass themselves.
As regards the concrete points that you raise:
stability of personnel
-     quality of appraisals
-     high level of approvals
-     financial position
we have already informed you of our comments, but unfortunately they have not
been included in the report. We are therefore obliged to state again our
position on these issues.
Stability of personnel
The changes in appraisal department personnel in recent years have
in fact been limited to:
Para. 3.04
1 resignation                                                                     cha been
1 death
1 switch as a result of an appointment to the position of Secretary General at
the Ministry of Finance
2 dismissals, the General Director and Board of Directors being of the view
that the behavior and availability of the staff in question were
unsatisfactory.
For an institution like the BRD, and over a period of three years, such
changes are absolutely normal.
Ouality of appraisals
It does not seem to us that the quality of appraisals has declined
in recent years. The difficulties encountered by the enterprises financed by hara bee07
the BRD are, unfortunately, part and parcel of all banking operations,             changed.
particularly those of development banks during a period of economic crisis.
The failure of companies such as SOMIRWA (refinanced by your
credit line 655-RW) and RWAKINA affected [the results of] previous years.
Although the current portfolio includes some firms currently facing problems,
this does not mean that the quality of appraisals as a whole can be called
into question.
The organizational changes, and specifically the reorganization of
the appraisal department into sectoral units, is designed to speed up the
preparation of appraisal reports by increasing staff familiarity with the         has been
sectors in question.  Since the authorization of a project requires che           cbansed.
approval of the Project Committee, the General Director and, for loans
exceeding RF 10 million, the Board of Directors, any lack of experience that
might be a cause for regret in light of the loan size should be offset by the
observations and adjustments made during these various analyses. The new
structure of the appraisal department, where large projects are examined by

the same team that reviews the small-scale portfolio, was in fact the result
of a recommendation made by a consultant financed by the UNDP, whose task was
to examine the BRD's organizational structure and human resources (Emile
Parenty, consultant, ECTI mission report, July 1987).
Level of aOprovals
It should be noted that a significant part of the RF 1,724 million Para. 4.01
of approvals in 1988 represented not the financing of new projects but the        has been
continuation of suppliers' credits already guaranteed by the BRD, or loans to  chansed-
complement credits granted earlier:
Extension of suppliers' credits guaranteed by the BRD (in RF million)
SORWACI                              106.1
SOBOLIRWA                             88
194.1
Complementary loans
PROMETAL                              10
Rwanda Brickworks, Ruliba             10
ECOMIRWA                               7
UTEXRWA                              260
SULFO                                100
SIEVA                                 50
ECOMEKI                                5.4
442.4
Total                                             636.5
When this RF 636.5 million is deducted, new approvals in 1988 were
RF 1,087.5 million, as compared to the projections in the operating program of
some RF 825 million.
Being already involved as guarantor, the BRD had hardly any choice
in this area since, if the projects were to fail, it would certainly have to
repay these suppliers' credits, perhaps subsequently increased by a
depreciation of the Rwanda franc.
Financial problems
This issue, along with those of interest rates and the level of
provisions, were clearly explained in our letter of July 27, 1989. We are
obliged to remind you that the difficulties encountered in mobilizing
resources in 1988 were partially the result of the suspension for almost a
year of Credit 1650-RW, which forced the BRD to meet its commitments on loans
already approved from its own resources and therefore to resort to short-term
financing not very compatible with the nature of its operations.
Currently the financial situation has improved as a result of new
repayments by clients and a reduction in the level of operations due to the
present unfavorable economic climate.

On May 2, 1990 the BRD was in surplus in the amount of
RF 223.4 million.
We deplore the fact that the positive aspects of the BRD's
management, which a concern for objectivity would have stressed, have been
passed over in silence.
Since 1987 considerable efforts have been made to increase the
BRD's contribution to Rwanda's economic development, and these efforts
continue.
Without wishing to produce an exhaustive list, we can cite the
following:
-     preparation in 1987 of an operating program for 1987-1991;
-     with UNDP assistance, execution of various sector studies and         Para. 3.03
implementation of a huge computerization program; each staff          has been
member has received on average 80 hours training on the use of    changed.
microcomputers and the utilization of various software packages;
with the assistance of the Center for Financial, Economic and
Banking Studies, an internal seminar was organized for senior BRD
staff for the first time in 1987;
a number of BRD staff were sent overseas for practical training,
specifically in Italy (FINAFRICA), France (CEFEB) and Austria
(UNDO);
Pars. 3.07
the organization under the BRD's aegis in May 1990 of a seminar on  has been
the economic evaluation of projects;                                   changed.
the participation of a number of institutions in the subregion,
viz. BDEGL in Goma, SOFIDE (Zaire), BNDE (Burundi), international
organizations such as Mulpoc (ECA) and several ministerial
departments, is evidence of the interest of these organizations in
the appraisal methods used by the BRD and the exchanges of
experience made possible by this BRD initiative;
the negotiations initiated with various donors to ensure the
continuation of BRD activities, which have led to the following
results:
-     in 1987, a loan from the Government of Rwanda of               Para. 4.08
RF 86.9 million;                                               has been
changed.
-     in 1988, a credit line from UNDP/ILO "Micro-Project" funds
of US$235,000, a line of credit from the CCCE for
F 20 million and a line of credit for 4 million ECUs fror4
the EIB;

in 1989, a credit line of 10 million units of account,
consisting of 6 million units of account from the ADF and
4 million units of account from the ADB.
This is clearly enough to demonstrate the concern of the Board of
Directors and General Director to continue and strengthen the actions carried
out by their predecessors.
Despite the economic recession prevailing since 1986, after the
prosperity that characterized the years 1983 through 1985, the BRD has
continued to pursue its mission without jeopardizing its basic equilibrium,
and to produce positive results.
In 1989 the BRD was the subject of an in-depth audit; we are
sending you the final report by a separate channel. The strengths and
weaknesses of the BRD are clearly brought out therein, and a number of
recommendations have been made. The implementation status of these
recommendations, which testifies to our concern to remedy as soon as possible
the weaknesses described, is also being forwarded to you.
Finally, an overall assessment of the impact of the financing made
available under Credits 896-RW and 1344-RW can perhaps best be obtained from   (These
the figures for value added and the number of jobs created.  The table            annexes have
attached to the annexes being sent to you separately shows that, for a sample not been
of 13 firms receiving the largest loans under the above-mentioned Credits and receBved by
representing 79X of total loans made from these credits, value added in                  )
respect of their 1988 activities was RF 3,344 million, while 1344 jobs were
created.
We must hope that the World Bank, which has always been an
important partner, will continue to help the BRD to develop its activities so
that it will remain one of the best-managed development banks in Africa.
Hoping that these observations will contribute to a better understanding of
the situation, I remain, yours, etc.
