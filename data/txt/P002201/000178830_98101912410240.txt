STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. The Economy 1/
1.01      Rwanda had a population of about 4.3 million in 1977 and with
an area of 26,340 square kilometers, is one of the most densely populated
countries in Africa. It is estimated that per capita GNP in 1976 was about
US$120, which is one of the lowest in the world. Real growth in per capita
GNP (only an average annual of 1.2% during 1970-1976) 2/ indicates some
improvement in the living standards of the population in the early 1970s.
Except land and a few deposits of cassiterite from which tin is extracted and
wolfram from which tungsten is produced, Rwanda has no other known natural
resources.
1.02      The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector, which remains
largely subsistence in nature. It provided the livelihood for about 90%
of the population and contributed about 57% of GDP in 1976. Agricultural
exports, particularly of coffee and tea, accounted for about 70% of total
exports in 1976, and provided a significant proportion of the Government's
tax revenues. The secondary sector, which includes organized and artisanal
mining, traditional and modern food manufacturing, construction and other
industries, accounted for about 23% of GDP in 1976. Commerce and other
services contributed about 20% of GDP.
1.03      Rwanda's economic development is hampered by several factors.
Firstly, agricultural productivity has been declining due to severe soil
erosion, the inferior quality of the new land being brought under use,
inappropriate cultivation techniques, and the lack of use of modern agri-
cultural inputs. Secondly, the increasing population (2.3% p.a.) has led
over the years to the fragmentation of cultivable land into small hold-
ings (about 1 hectare per farm family), a shift from cash crop production
towards foodstuffs, and increasing underemployment and unemployment. Thirdly,
there has been little effort, until recently, to train an adequate number of
Rwandese in the skills vital to the country's development, particularly
professionals (e.g., engineers, architects, managers, etc...) and technicians
of various types. Consequently, there has been increasing reliance on expat-
riate technical assistance.  Finally, Rwanda is a land-locked country located
1/   The most recent economic report on Rwanda (Report No. 1108-RW) is dated
July 27, 1976. An economic mission has visited Rwanda in February/March
1979 and its report is expected to be distributed in October 1979.

between Uganda, Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania, at a distance of at least 1,700
kilometers from the nearest seaport, Mombasa in Kenya. The long distances,
the high cost of fuel and the bulky nature of most of Rwanda's imports (e.g.,
cement), have resulted in high transportation costs of imports. In addition,
different transportation regulations between Rwanda and its neighbors and
border problems, have led to irregular supply and frequent shortages of vital
materials as well as severe price increases.
B. The Industrial Sector
1.04      For a few years after independence (1962), the industrial sector
in Rwanda did not register any significant growth or development. Even after
the establishment of a separate customs regime from Burundi, only those new
manufacturing activities that were based on the processing of agricultural
products, such as tea, coffee and pyrethrum experienced some significant
growth. The industrial policy at that stage aimed at providing an environment
conducive to investors, emphasizing import-substituting and export-oriented
projects that were based on local resources.
1.05      The available data indicates that, except for a large brewery, there
are less than 100 modern manufacturing enterprises, all relatively small in
size.  Wage employment in industry (excluding mining) was estimated at 15,700
in 1976.  Food manufacturing is the dominant industrial activity, accounting
for 64% of the value added by the secondary sector. This activity, however,
remains largely traditional and artisanal and modern food manufacturing
activities account for only 18.5%, of the value added by this sector. Con-
struction is second in importance (15.3% of value added by secondary sector),
followed by mining (9%). Mining is scattered around the country and most
modern manufacturing activity is located in or around Kigali, the capital.
Gisenyi, Butare and Cyangugu are growing in importance. Foreign ownership of
industrial enterprises is limited to some modern manufacturing enterprises,
but is predominant in the mining and construction sectors. Government owner-
ship is concentrated in the few 'Larger enterprises in manufacturing and mining.
1.06      Annual investment in manufacturing is estimated to have increased
from RwF228 million in 1973 to about RwF800 million in 1977, for a total of
about RwF2.3 billion during 1973-1977. On its own, this represents rapid
growth, but the starting point is a low base and the absolute amounts remain
relatively small. The major reasons for the increasing investment in manu-
facturing are the local opportunities which were unexploited, the increase
in transportation costs which made the local production cost of some goods
attractive relative to imports, and the political stability that Rwanda
offered relative to the neighbouring countries. Also well-to-do Rwandese
who concentrated on commerce started to look for other investment opportuni-
ties.

C.   Economic Prospects and Constraints
1.07      The problems and constraints facing Rwanda's economic development
(para. 1.03) have been recognized in the Second Five-Year Plan 1/. The plan
is centered around an integrated rural development program which aims to
achieve, in  1± medium term, the necessary structural transformation of the
economy to increase food production, train more and better qualified manpower,
improve the living standards, particularly in the rural areas, and reduce
the reliance on external sources of assistance. The other sectors, such as
manufacturing, mining, construction, tourism, and transport are expected to
play a strong supporting role. The plan's target for GDP growth is an annual
average of 5.9%. The target growth rates for the sectors, as well as the
changes in their shares in GDP are shown in Table 1.

1.08      The total planned investment is about RwF54 billion (US$590 mil-
lion). The share of the Government would be about 7%, the private domestic
sector 23%, and the externally financed public sector at 70%. The share of
industry, excluding mining, is roughly estimated at about RwF4 billion (about
US$44 million), or about 7.5% of th-e total planned investment. This appears
to be realistic given the level of investment that was achieved during 1973-
1977. Total wage employment, including expatriates, would increase from about
125,000 persons in 1976 to 166,000 in 1981, with expatriates increasing from
about 2,900 to 3,850, respectively. Wage employment in industry (excluding
mining) would increase by 8,600 persons, to 24,300 in 1981.

1.09      The Plan's overall objectives and priorities appear to be consistent
with the present problems and future prospects of the Rwandese economy. How-
ever, except for manufacturing, the targets seem to be relatively ambitious.
Firstly, there is heavy reliance on foreign assistance, since 70% of the
required resources are expected from external sources, which in most instances
is project specific. But many of the projects identified in the Plan are
either at a very early stage of preparation or are not prepared at all.
Secondly, the share of investment expected from the private domestic sector
appears high. Finally, the adverse impact of the shortage of qualified man-
power and the transportation problems (para. 1.03) seems to have been under-
estimated.
1.10      Industrial Development during the Second Plan.  There are several
explanations for the limited development of industry, so far, and particularly
manufacturing. Firstly, the domestic market is small, the possibilities of
exports to neighbouring countries are limited and the per capita income is low.
Thus the potential demand does not justify, in many instances, the establish-
ment of even minimum size plants. Secondly, investment costs are high largely
due to the high transportation cost and the unreliable supply of imports,
which force many enterprises to hold excessive stocks of raw materials and
spare parts, with associated high carrying costs. Thirdly, the low domestic
savings limit the possibilities of industrial investment by Rwandese nationals
and the Government's tight fiscal situation hampers its involvement in this
regard in any significant manner. Finally, the lack of local entrepreneurs
and the shortage of skilled manpower has discouraged industrial investment.
1.11      The priority accorded by the Second Five-Year Plan to the develop-
ment of industry is second only to agriculture. The approach to industrial
development is consistent with the country's present situation and future
potential. There is recognition of industry's ability to create jobs, although
at a much higher capital cost than in agriculture. The Plan's objectives for
this sector are to develop the agro-industries and the rural artisanat,
encourage the labor intensive enterprises, concentrate on the production of
necessary commodities, and encourage export-oriented industries and those
aimed at import substitution. The target rates of growth for modern manufac-
turing is an average annual of 16.5%, modern construction 8.2%, mining 7.6%,
while that for artisanal industry (including food production) is 2.8%, and
traditional construction 4.6%.
1.12      Industrial policy during the Second Plan incorporates certain meas-
ures that would help achieve the above objectives and targets. These include
the establishment of a guarantee fund to help small and medium-scale enter-
prises obtain credit from commercial banks which has been completed; a newly
approved investment code that extends the same tax and customs duty conces-
sions to the Rwandese investors that the previous code (1964) restricted to

foreigners 1i; the creation of a technical school to train industrial and
mining technicians is under way; and the reorganization of public enterprises
to give them greater operational autonomy and better qualified managers and
staff.
1.13      At the time of appraisal of the first IDA credit to BRD there were
plans for the establishment by the end of 1976 of a UNDP-financed Bureau for
Industrial Promotion at the Ministry of Finance, which would include 5 or
6 experts to help entrepreneurs undertake industrial projects. This project
was delayed and because less funds are available now than originally antici-
pated, the scope of activities has been scaled down. As presently designed,
the Bureau would include two experts who would mainly help promote among en-
terpreneurs an awareness of investment opportunities in industry. They would
also undertake some limited sector work. Experts are being recruited.
D.   The Financial System
1.14      The most important institutions that comprise Rwanda's financial
system are the Central Bank, two commercial banks, the Development Bank of
Rwanda, the People's Bank, the Savings Association, and the Caisse Hypothe-
caire. The main offices of all these institutions are located in Kigali and
their operations are conducted out of there. However, some of these institu-
tions (the commercial banks, the People's Bank and the Savings Association)
have branches in a few of the larger towns that offer limited service.
1.15      The Central Bank (Banque Nationale du Rwanda - BNR) is responsible
for supervising the country's financial institutions, formulating monetary
and credit policies, and managing the international reserves. BNR has at
its disposal several of the tools traditionally used to influence credit
and monetary developments, and has frequently resorted to changing the credit
ceilings either on an overall basis or by sector. To reinforce its control
of the country's credit situation it has issued a regulation that requires
all loans over RwF5 million to be submitted to it for prior approval. BNR
is active in financing the public sector: its share of the total domestic
credit extended to the Government and public enterprises amounted to 38% in
1975 and increased to 46% in 1976. BNR also administers a system of import
licensing which permits it to exercise selective control over the allocation
of the available foreign exchange. In 1977, it issued a regulation that
required deposit margins on imports ranging from 50% for corporations to
90% to individuals.
1/   The 1964 investment code has reportedly been applied in only one case.
The new code is likely to be used more often because it covers the
Rwandese nationals and includes exemptions, for varying periods of
time, from customs duties on imported capital goods, spare parts and
raw materials; income tax holiday for five years, starting with the
first year of full operation; priority of access to foreign exchange
under the foreign exchange licensing system; and, for foreign inves-
tors, the right of repatriation of dividend income.

de Kigali, established in 1963 and 1966, respectively) are majority foreign-
owned. As of December 31, 1977, together they had total assets of RwF7.0
billion, and total deposits of RwF5.2 billion, only 7% of which was in term
deposits. The commercial banks are active in financing exports, particularly
coffee, and imports. They also extend credit to the public sector, where
their share of the total domestic claims on the Government and the public
enterprises amounted to 47.5% in 1975, but declined to 33% in 1976.
1.17      Of the term lending institutions existing in Rwanda, the develop-
ment bank (Banque Rwandaise de Developpement - BRD) is the most important.
It will be described in detail in the next chapter. Next is the Savings
Association whose share of the total domestic credit is less than 5%. The
Caisse Hypothecaire has been given the sole responsibility for financing
all housing and building construction, whose costs exceed RwFO.5 million.
In order to assist it in mobilizing the resources to carry on its activi-
ties, the Central Bank's 1977 regulations required the two commercial banks
and the Savings Association to hold given amounts of medium-term notes
issued by the Caisse Hypothecaire.
1.18      Inflation in Rwanda aLccelerated during 1974 and 1975.  Consumer
prices increased by 9.5% in 1973, 31% in 1974 and 43% in 1975. This was the
result of: (a) the rapid world inflation which increased the cost of most
of Rwanda's imports; (b) the increase in money supply; and (c) the increase
in domestic credit to the public sector, particularly in 1974, (after which
it decreased slightly in 1975). The inflation rate was estimated at 8.5%
in 1976, and at 13% in 1977. It is expected to be about 12% in 1978 and to
decline to an average of 8% in 1980-85.
1.19      Interest Rates (Annex 1) are fixed by BNR.  Commercial bank lending
rates for consumer loans, import credits and working capital for manufacturing
enterprises are 11%, while those for export credits for coffee are 5%, and for
tea 4% while the rate for marketing export crops is 8%. The Savings Associa-
tion lending rate to the private sector on short and medium-term credits (up
to 5 years) is 9%. BRD's lending rates for medium and long-term loans vary
between 5.5% and 9%, depending upon the sector in which the project is being
financed. The rate on the one-year treasury bills varies between 3% and 5%,
while that for term deposits of more than one year is 3.75%.
1.20      This structure of interest rates appears to be low.  The Govern-
ment's interest rate policy aims to attract foreign investors into Rwanda by
maintaining a generally lower level of interest rates than in neighbouring
countries and to encourage both local and foreign investment in particular
sectors, such as agriculture, through concessionary interest rates. The
Government also believes that increases in interest rates will generate little
additional savings and discourage investors in industry.



- 7 -
1.21       IDA has expressed the view that low interest rates may not be enough
to compensate for other impediments to investment in industry such as the
shortage of qualified manpower and that higher savings rates would help
mobilize additional resources and reduce the reliance by the Government on
deficit financing. The dialogue between the Government and IDA, which started
in 1975, at the time of appraisal of the first IDA credit to BRD has continued
and is being pursued at the occasion of the proposed second credit to BRD. It
is worth mentioning that during this period, there has been an increase in the
average of BRD's lending rates, from about 7.5% in 1975 to about 8.0% in 1977
and it is expected to average about 8.5% in 1978-1979.
II. THIE INSTITUTION
A.   Institutional Aspects
BRD's Objectives
2.01       BRD was established in 1967 with a broad mandate as a limited
liability company to encourage the creation and development of enterprises
in Rwanda and promote the diversification of the country's economic struc-
ture and the regional balance of investments. To do so, BRD is authorized
to grant term loans or guarantees and make equity participations in enter-
prises in the productive sectors of the Rwandese economy and to undertake
the activities necessary for its operations. BRD is autonomous and its
decisions are made on the basis of the results of its own appraisal of the
technical, financial and economic merits of projects.
Share Capital and Ownership
2.02       BRD's share capital consists of "A" shares which must account for
at least 55% of the total and are reserved for the Government and other public
agencies and institutions, and "B" shares for private and foreign share-
holders 1/. There are no differences between the rights and privileges of
either category of shareholders. On September 1, 1978, BRD's share capital
was doubled to RwF416 million. RwF43.5 million of the increase consisted of
a stock dividend while RwF164.5 million was in new subscriptions, of which
RwF120 million (including RwF50 million Government loan which was converted
into equity) was subscribed by "A" shareholders; the remaining RwF44.5 mil-
lion was subscribed by "B" shareholders. Ownership of BRD's share capital
is presently distributed as follows: the public sector 62.5%, the domestic
private sector 15.8%, and the foreign shareholders 21.7%.
1/   The two most important "B" shareholders are DEC and CCCE who presently
subscribe RwF41 million each to BRD's share capital.



-8-
Board of Directors
2.03       BRD's Board of Directors consists of eleven members, of whom six
directors represent the "A" shareholders, or the public sector, and five
represent the "B" shareholders. The President of the Republic appoints the
Chairman of the Board. The five directors for the "B" shareholders represent
DEG, CCCE, the two commercial banks and the Brewery of Rwanda. The Board
meets on a regular basis to determine BRD's policy and it approves all loans,
equity participations and guarantees.  It also takes an active interest in
seeing that the BRD evolve as a sound development institution. Overall the
Board's performance is very satisfactory.
Management, Organization and Staffing
2.04       Management.  The present Directeur-General of BRD is a Rwandese
national who was appointed by the President of the Republic to this position
in 1973. He is a capable manager and is well respected by all parties dealing
with BRD. He has two capable expatriate assistants: a Burundi national, who
joined BRD in 1973, is in charge of BRD's administrative and financial opera-
tions; and a German national, wh1o joined BRD in 1975 under the auspices of the
German bilateral assistance, is in charge of investments and project evalua-
tion. The latter's contract is likely to be renewed for two years in 1979. A
technical/engineering advisor, also under German bilateral assistance, joined
BRD in November 1977 for two years.
2.05       Organization and Staffing.  BRD is organized in two major depart-
ments. The administration and finance department is responsible for project
follow-up, disbursement and loana collection, as well as for maintaining BRD's
accounts and administering the local and foreign resources. The investment
department is responsible for project evaluation in all its aspects and for
providing technical assistance to the enterprises that BRD has assisted. This
organization has proven suitable and efficient so far. BRD's staff totals
44, of whom 15 are professionals, including three expatriates. The Rwandese
nationals who are among the professional staff of BRD are university graduates
who have been with BRD for varying periods of time and are being trained on
the job. They include economists, financial analysts and a lawyer who are
gaining experience and should start assuming additional responsibility at BRD
soon. The staff is generally dedicated and hard working. BRD has a staffing
plan based upon its own projection of its operations up to 1985, and a train-
ing program which mainly relies upon on-the-job triaining. BRD's training and
staff development program are satisfactory.
Policy Statement
2.06       BRD's policy statement is satisfactory.  However, two exceptions to
one provision, which restricts BRD's exposure in a single project to 20% of
its net worth, were made in 1976 and 1977 when BRD approved two projects in
which its contribution exceeded the normal limit of 20% of net worth.  In both
cases, BRD took adequate measures to protect itself by asking for either the



- 9 -
Government's or the Central Bank's guarantee for that portion of its assis-
tance that exceeded the normal limit. There is likelihood that such a situa-
tion will occur again since BRD's project pipeline (para. 2.27) includes a
number of projects in which BRD's contribution is likely to exceed the normal
exposure limit, even after BRD's capital has been doubled.
2.07      This situation raises questions about the impact on BRD of such over-
exposure in several projects. Several factors need to be taken into consider-
ation. Firstly, in Rwanda, BRD is de facto the only source of medium and
long-term financing, particularly by the private sector, for investments in
industry, tourism, transport and agricultural product processing. It is
roughly estimated that its contribution to investment during 1976 and 1977
amounted to 40% of the total invested in industry, 22% in tourism, and
15% in transport. Its contribution during the Second Five-Year Plan will
at least be of the same order of magnitude, if not larger. Secondly, BRD
remains the major, perhaps the sole Rwandese institution, that is capable,
both technically and professionally, of properly evaluating investment proj-
ects. This will continue to be the case for sometime, particularly since
the plans for strengthening the Bureau of Industrial Promotion have been
scaled down (para. 1.13). Finally, the alternatives available to BRD to avoid
exposure beyond the normal limit are either premature or pose problems to BRD.
One alternative under which BRD would act as a leader of a financing syndicate
could be possible, if other sources of financing were available. However, in
Rwanda, virtually no other institution is ready to participate in medium and
long-term lending. The exception is real estate, which is not of priority
to BRD. Another alternative would be for BRD to undertake large projects
which entail exposure above the normal limit on a managed fund basis.
From BRD's point of view, however, direct financing coupled with Government/
Central Bank guarantees seems preferable to a managed fund approach because it
guarantees BRD a greater degree of autonomy and independence in deciding upon
projects. The managed fund approach might face BRD with the problem of having
to supervise and follow-up projects, the design of which it may not be able
to influence. During negotiations, agreement was obtained from BRD that in
those cases where over-exposure is necessary, BRD would on a regular basis
obtain adequate guarantees of loan repayment on at least that part of the loan
that exceeds its normal exposure limit, either from the Government for public
sector projects, or from other creditworthy sources for private sector projects.
Interest Rates
2.08      As of March 1978, the interest rates charged by BRD varied between
5.5% and 9%. Commercial/industrial projects are charged an interest rate of
6-7% per year on medium-term loans (1-5 years) and 7-8% per year on long-term
loans (longer than 5 years). In addition, a commission of 1% or 2% per year
is charged on funds disbursed and outstanding. The majority of the medium-
term loans are for small or medium-scale projects, while the long-term loans
are predominantly for large projects. For projects financed under KfW funds,
the interest rate is 4.5-6.0% per year for medium-term and 6-7.5% per year
for long-term, while the interest rates under the first IDA credit are 9% for



- 10 -
medium and large-scale enterprises and 7% for small-scale enterprises, with
the exchange risk being borne by the Government at no charge. BRD has also
recently adopted a new "commitment commission" of 3/4% to be charged to all
loans and calculated on the undisbursed amount of a loan.
2.09      The forecasts of operations (paras 2.28 and 2.29) indicate that
BR)'s administrative fixed costs would be increasing due to the need for more
staff to handle the higher level of operations and to the depreciation of
the new office building. Thus BRD would need to earn a spread of about 5%
on its lending operations to cover operating costs and earn a minimal profit.
Achieving such a spread early is particularly important in view of the pos-
sible delay in availability of new lines of credit for disbursement. If
disbursements are slower than projected, earnings from the loan portfolio
would be reduced, while fixed costs would continue to increase. This 5%
spread is needed over and above BRD's cost of resources, which are expected
to increase due to higher borrowing costs, both locally and abroad.
2.10      Both the Rwandese Government and BRD do not favor a large increase
in BRD's lending rates. The industrial sector in Rwanda is still immature
and fragile, and investment is only just beginning to grow due in part to the
political and economic stability Rwanda presently offers. However, there
remain many inhibiting factors (paras 1.03, 1.10 and 1.20), in view of which
the Government and BRD feel that to promote and stimulate investment, BRD's
interest rates should offer arn incentive to both local and foreign investors.
A large increase in BRD's lending rates would be considered a deterrent,
particularly by the few local Rwandese entrepreneurs who are considering
term investments rather than short-term trading, even if Government continues
to carry the foreign exchange risk. Thus, there is justification for raising
BRD's lending rates to help it maintain a sound financial position, but there
is need to keep this increase moderate so that the growth of industry and BRD
would not be unduly slowed down (para. 3.06 (c)).
Procedures
2.11      Appraisal.  Since the appraisal of the first IDA credit, BRD has
improved the quality and standard of its appraisal work, particularly the
economic aspects. It is expected that through further association with IDA,
BRD would continue to improve the quality of its appraisals. Also, BRD is
already making a real impact on the design of projects during appraisal to
make them more suitable to the Rwandese economy; this was evident in some of
the projects that were submitted to IDA for approval under the first credit.
A case in point is a project for producing plastic articles, where BRD con-
vinced the promoter to divide the project into two phases, with the second
phase beginning about two years after the first phase when market demand was
expected to pick up.
2.12      Supervision.  BRD's supervision procedures are generally adequate.
Currently three staff undertake supervision of projects, which receive two
or three visits each year, even outside Kigali. Projects encountering diffi-
culties receive additional visits. Also, BRD requires client companies to
stubmit quarterly reports which are then reviewed. Annual accounts are also



- 11 -
required, but due to the lack of auditors in Rwanda, these accounts are not
audited by outside auditors and are often delayed. With the expanding port-
folio, BRD's supervision would need to be strengthened, and efforts are
underway to recruit two additional staff for the supervision unit.
2.13      Procurement and Disbursement.  BRD's procedures for procurement
and disbursement are satisfactory. For the larger projects quotations are
obtained during appraisal, and in cases where substantial construction is
involved, BRD may require competitive bidding. BRD expects equity funds
to be disbursed first and loan funds are disbursed against invoices.
Auditors
2.14      Under the first IDA credit, it was agreed that an independent
auditing firm acceptable to IDA would verify BRD's accounts. The cost of
three such audits, starting with the 1976 accounts, was covered under the
first credit. The 1976 and 1977 accounts have been audited by the private
firm of Pannell, Kerr, Forster and Co. which is located in Nairobi and has
French speaking staff and were found satisfactory and acceptable; the 1978
accounts are being prepared. The lack of auditors in Rwanda, and the shortage
of qualified French-speaking auditors in the region have led to difficulties
and delays in auditing BRD's account:s because of the need to resort to foreign
auditors.
2.15      At the time of the appraisal of the first IDA credit, a proposal to
finance a feasibility study on the need for and the nature of an audit firm
in Rwanda was included in the project. During negotiations, this proposal
was deleted at the Government's initiative. Later, however, the Government
changed its position and requested that such a proposal be revived. The
proposed second IDA credit, therefore, includes funds for undertaking a feas-
ibility study on the need for auditors, and for establishing an audit firm
in Rwanda, if the results of the study are positive (paras 3.01 and 3.05).
B.   Operations
2.16      BRD's total loan approvals increased from RwF163.2 million in 1974
to RwF367.4 million in 1978. The growth in approvals has essentially been in
long-term lending to large projects. Most of the medium-term lending has been
to small and medium-scale projects. Commitments have increased rapidly, from
RwF1O million in 1974 to RwF112 million in 1978 and disbursements followed the
same pace and pattern.
2.17      During 1974-78, BRD approved loans to 95 projects, for about RwF1.3
billion.  The distribution of the amount of the approved loans by sector over
this period was 62% for industry, 31% for transport (including a large number
of small loans for passenger vehicles), 2% for tourism, 1% for agriculture,
and 4% for other activities. No short-term loans were approved during
1974-78. Projects granted medium-term loans accounted for 74% of the number



- 12 -
of projects approved during this period, but for only 36% of the amount, while
long-term loans accounted for 26% of the number and 64% of the amount. The
number of projects requiring loans of RwF5 million or less (about US$54,000)
was 71 (75% of the total) and accounted for 10% of the aggregate amount. The
number of projects witn loans larger than RwF5 million was 24 (25% of the
total) and accounted for 90% of the aggregate amount. The sectoral mix of
the projects financed by BRD has changed. In 1974 the transport and tourism
sectors were the main focus of BRD's lending; in 1975 the industrial sector
became the most important with significant amounts still being lent to the
transport sector. However in the last three years the industrial/mining
sector investments have become predominant. Most of the projects have been
for processing of local resources, including some export oriented projects or
for import substitution.
2.18      Because BRD is the only non-Government source of foreign exchange
term finance in Rwanda, it has been involved in financing all sizes of proj-
ects from the SOMIRWA mining project requiring a loarL of RwF150 million to
small scale projects requiring about RwF0.5 million. Whenever possible BRD
has attempted to keep the size of its investment within 20% of net worth in
order to spread the risks over its portfolio. The selected projects which
BRD has financed since 1976 have estimated financial rates of return that
range from 18% to more than 40%, and economic rates of return of 20% or more.
The estimated investment cost per job created, including working capital,
ranged from about $3,000 to $53,200. In the case of the loan to SOMIRWA
(Societe des Mines du Rwanda), the number of new jobs created would not be
significant, but the rehabilitation of the mining operations will prolong the
employment of about 6,000 wage earners as well as that of several thousand
artisan miners who sell the ores they extract to SOMIRWA.
Portfolio
2.19      Loan Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1978, BRD's loan portfolio
outstanding amounted to RwF565 mi:Llion, which is distributed as follows:
industry (including mining) 83%, transport 5%, tourism 6%, agriculture 2%,
and other 4%. Long-term loans accounted for RwF459 million (81% of the
portfolio), and debts considered doubtful or bad accounted for RwF14.3 mil-
lion. The projects have a diverse range of ownership. Some totally owned
by Rwandese entrepreneurs, foreigners or Government, while others have joint
ownership between private and Goviernment interests. Most of the projects have
been approved since 1974; therefore the portfolio is generally quite young
with many projects still under construction or just starting operations.
Those projects that are in operation, appear to be quite profitable and
earning attractive rates of return on investment.
2.20      As of June 30, 1978, the portfolio affectecd by arrears above three
months amounted to about 2% of the total. Over 50% of the arrears occurred
in the transport sector which only accounts for 6% of the overall portfolio.
Some of the loans in arrears are small loans for vehicles made under the



- 13 -
Swiss loan, which was specifically for transportation equipment. Of the
RwF14.3 million loans which were considered doubtful or bad, BRD has made
specific provisions for RwF12.4 million.. Additionally there is a reserve
for general risks amounting to RwF23 million (4.1% of loans outstanding).
Thus BRD's loan portfolio was generally in a good condition, and generous
provisions/reserves had been set aside for possible losses.
2.21      Equity Portfolio.  As of Decetmber 31, 1978, BRD's equity portfolio
was about RwF140 million and included investments in 11 projects. BRD has
minority holdings ranging from 0.3% to 21.4% in the projects in which it
has equity investments, except for a la,rge storage project "Magerwa", where
BRD's holding is 68.8%. This project is also BRD's largest equity investment
(RwF55 million), and has been providing BRD with significant and secure income
(para. 2.22); it paid a dividend of 232 in 1977. Two other projects have paid
dividends, but six of the investments have been made since 1975 and have only
recently begun operation or are still under construction.
Financial Results and Condition
2.22      Financial Results.  BRD's inc:ome statements and balance sheets for
1974-78 are shown in Annexes 2 and 3. The 1978 unaudited statements indicate
a profit of RwF19.6 million, a small increase from RwF18.6 million in 1977.
Revenues from the loan portfolio (RwF37.6 million) showed some increase over
the previous year. Increased earnings from an expanded long-term portfolio
were offset by a reduced medium-term portfolio. Dividends earned on the
equity portfolio decreased slightly in 1978 to RwF22.4 million, but nearly all
dividend income was from the project Magerwa, which has regularly paid such
dividends over the past six years. In 1978, income from loans as a percent of
average total assets was 5.0% and that from dividends was 3.0%.
2.23      Total expenses rose from RwF38.2 million in 1977 to RwF45.5 million
in 1978. Financial charges as a percent of average total assets increased
from 1.3% in 1977 to 1.4% in 1978, while administrative expenses rose from
2.8% to 3.2% respectively. Personnel costs increased in 1978 by RwF4.5
million, to RwF16.4 million, as more staff were hired to handle the increasing
level of operations. Specific provisions are made each year against doubtful
and bad loans, but none was necessary in 1978. Additionally, a charge of
3.0% of the increase in the normal loan portfolio outstanding is made each
year against income to maintain a reserve account for general risks. This
charge of RwF5.7 million together with the increase in personnel costs and
the increase in the share capital of BRD late in the year resulted in a
decline in the 1978 return on average net worth to 5.6%, as against 7.3%
in 1977. This level of profitability is reasonable for a young small bank
entering a significant growth phase.
2.24      Financial Condition.  As of D)ecember 31, 1978, BRD was both sound
and creditworthy. BRD's term debt/equity ratio is about 1:1, well within
the 3:1 limit. Of the medium and long--term debt totalling RwF400 million,
RwF247.5 million was in foreign exchange borrowings on which Government



-- 14 -
carries the foreign exchange risk. The remainder was local currency borrow-
ings from the Government, Central Bank and local commercial banks. Given its
conservative provisions policy (para. 2.23), BRD is adLequately protected
against losses on the portfolio. BRD does not have liquidity problems as
Goverrmuent/Central Bank will make available local currency resources as neces-
sary.
Resources
2.25      As of December 31, 1978, BRD's local currency resources totalled
RwF612 million, including local currency borrowings of RwF153 million.
Foreign currency resources totallecl RwF605 million. The local currency term
borrowings have maturities ranging from 3 to 25 years with low interest rates
from 3% to 4.5%. Only RwF20 million of these local currency borrowings were
provided by a local commercial bank, the remainder being on-lent by the
Government and Central Bank from loans made by Swiss F'und and Arab League. As
of December 31, 1978, about RwF234 million of BRD's local currency resources
were uncommitted.
2.26      BRD's foreign exchange resources include two loans from KfW total-
ling about RwF127 million, a loan from CCCE of RwF11O million and the first IDA
credit of RwF368 million. The interest rate paid by BRD to Government for the
IDA credit on-lent to it and on CCCE loan is 4%. The first KfW loan has a
0.75% interest rate and the second KfW loan an interest rate of 4% for funds
used for long-term lending and 1.5%' for medium-term lending. Government
carries the foreign exchange risk on all these loans/credits. The CCCE loan
is tied to French procurement, and BRD has had difficulty in committing these
funds as most investors in Rwanda have sought to use generally Belgian or
South Asian equipment with which they were familiar. BRD is intending to
discuss with CCCE some relaxation of the procurement requirement. As of
December 31, 1978, about RwF248 million of BRD's foreign resources were
uncommitted.
C.   Prospects
2.27      Projects Pipeline.  As of December 31, 1978, BRD had a substantial
pipeline of projects, which included 25 projects of various sizes involving
total investments of about US$30 million, for which assistance of about US$10
million was being sought from BRD. The projects were being promoted by Govern-
ment, private Rwandese and locally--based foreign groups, in some cases with
joint Government and private ownership. The majority of these projects were
in the industrial sector and included manufacture of batteries, metal products,
textile, matches, pyrethrum refining, fruit juice, metal workshops, tea fac-
tories, plastic pipes and photographic processing. There were also many small
projects which were not included in the pipeline. Four of the large projects
included in the pipeline would require assistance in excess of BRD's present
normal exposure limit, which is about RwF83 million (US$900,000). BRD's
intervention in the projects under study will be predominantly foreign ex-
change financing. Based on the above pipeline and additional projects arising



- 15 -
from the development plan, BRD is forecasting a steady growth in approvals of
15% per annum, with total approvals rising from RwF406 million in 1979 to
above RwF600 million by 1982. On current estimates of inflation (12% in 1978
falling to 8% in the period 1980-85) the forecasts indicate a significant
growth in lending in real terms by BRD.
2.28      Financial Forecasts.  Annexes 4 to 6 include BRD's financial fore-
casts for the period 1979-82.  The forecasts reflect the fact that BRD is
entering into a significant growth period, where in 1979/80 the increased
staff necessary to handle the increased operations, would depress net income.
In 1980/81 the interest revenue generated by the rapidly growing loan port-
folio would be partially offset by the increased depreciation resulting from
the investment in the new office building 1/. Net profit as a percent of
average net worth will gradually decline from 5.3% in 1978 to about 3% in
1981, but will rise to 5.4% in 1982. However, due to the increasing spread
that would be earned on the loan portfolio following interest rate increases
(para. 3.06 (c)) and the rate of growth of lending, BRD will show strong
earnings growth thereafter. The growth in lending operations is essentially
financed by foreign currency borrowings and net cash generation of local
currency. Long-term debt to net worth would rise from 1.6 in 1979 to 2.9 in
1982, which is just within BRD's present long-term debt/equity limit.
2.29      Because of the increasing fixed costs due to increased staff and
depreciation of the new office building, it is important that BRD generate
the forecast revenue in order to operate profitably. To achieve the forecast
revenue targets requires that BRD aggressively pursue not just the appraisal
and commitment of new loans, but also their subsequent disbursement on schedule.
Equally it is important that BRD have the second IDA credit and the third KfW
loan available for commitment in 197'3, otherwise forecast lending levels will
not be achieved and the growth in interest revenue will be delayed. Given the
small profit margins forecast in the next two or three years, such interest
revenue generation is clearly important for profitable operation.
1/   BRD is presently occupying rented premises, which have become inadequate
for the increasing staff. Due to the shortage of office space in Kigali,
BRD is planning to construct an office building, which would adequately
meet BRD's need for space until about 1990. After completion BRD will
occupy at most half the space available and will rent out the remainder.
The preliminary cost estimate of this building is about RwF180 million.
However, BRD has not taken a final decision on this matter. The fore-
casts have taken into consideration only the depreciation of the building
and assumed that the part of operating costs attributable to BRD would be
about the same as the rent BRD presently pays. No additional net income
has been included because the financing plan for this building is not
reasonably defined and at least over the projection period any additional
income is not likely to be significant.

Resource Requirements
2.30      As of December 31, 1978, BRD had foreign resources available for
commitment amounting to RwF248 million or US$2.7 million. Foreign exchange
commitments by BRD during 1979-80 are forecast at about RwF937 million or
US$10.1 million. Thus BRD's foreign exchange resources gap during this
period is RwF689 million (US$7.4 million). This forecast assumes that the
existing loan from CCCE, which is tied to French procurement, can be fully
committed within this period. BRD is seeking to cover the forecast resource
gap with further credits from IDA (US$5 million) and KfW (US$2.4 million).
The local currency resource requirements will be met out of net cash gener-
ation.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   The First IDA Credit to BRD
3.01      The first IDA credit to BRD (No. 655-RW, US$4.0 million) was approved
on July 15, 1976 and became effective on March 2, 1977. As of February 28,
1979 US$2.5 million has been committed and US$2.3 million disbursed. BRD has
submitted to IDA for approval another two projects, which together with the
amount already approved would fully commit the first IDA credit.
3.02      The sub-projects submitted to IDA for financing included three
projects above the free limit and one project below the free limit. These
projects were well designed and appraised and fully justified on technical
and financial grounds and would contribute significantly to the country's
economic development. The largest project (subloan of US$1.7 million) was
to assist SOMIRWA in rehabilitating its mining operations (para. 2.18), in
preparation for a following phase when mining operations would expand and a
refining plant would be constructed. Another project assists a soap factory
in diversifying its operations by adding a line for the production of sweets.
The third large project was for the creation of a factory to produce plastic
articles for household use and plastic packaging materials. A project below
the free limit would assist a qualified Rwandese mechanic in equiping a garage
for automobile repair.
B.   Objectives of the Proposed Second IDA Credit
3.03      The proposed project would support Rwanda's efforts to develop the
productive sectors of the economy in line with the strategy of the Second
Five-Year Plan (para. 1.07). Thus the proceeds of the proposed second IDA
credit would provide the foreign exchange needed to help finance capital
investment. It is estimated that the proposed project would help finance
projects, with a total investment of about US$15 million, and would help
create about 400 new jobs. Another major objective of the proposed second
credit is to continue to reinforce the efforts to strengthen BRD, which were



- 17 -
started under the first IDA credit. BRD is a relatively young institution
that is going through a growth phase during which it will undoubtedly encounter
problems of transition to a mature institution. Finally, a specific objective
of the project is to assist the Government of Rwanda in undertaking a study to
assess the need for an auditing firm, to design a program to establish such a
firm and to help launch its operations.
C.   Description of the Project
3.04      The proposed project would include the following two components:
(a) US$5.0 million from the proceeds of the IDA credit would be
passed on by the Government to BRD as a line of credit to be
relent by BRD to sound projects; and
(b) US$0.2 million to finance a feasibility study and the estab-
lishment of an auditing firm in Rwanda.
The Proposed Credit to BRD
3.05      The line of credit to BRD would aim to finance the foreign exchange
component of the fixed capital investment and initial working capital required
by subprojects approved by BRD in all the sectors that BRD is usually permitted
to finance. These subprojects would be either private, public or foreign owned
and in some instances may have mixed ownership; and would be based either on
local resources or aim to substitute locally produced goods for imports. BRD
is expected to finance an average of about 33% of the investment cost of all
the projects.
3.06      Terms and Conditions.  During negotiations it was agreed that the
proposed second line of credit to BRD would carry the following terms and
conditions:
(a) Eligibility. All subprojects in the sectors that are within
the scope of BRD's operations would be eligible for financing;
(b) Free Limit. The free limit for an individual subproject would
be US$200,000, and the aggregate free limit US$2 million. This
would allow IDA to review projects for about 60% of the credit;
(c)  On-lending Rate, Commitment Fee, and Re-lending Rate.   As
mentioned above (paras 2.08-2.10) the cost of resources to BRD
has a major impact upon BRD's profitability, particularly during
this growth phase where fixed costs would be increasing rapidly
(para. 2.28). Moreover, since IDA would be supplying about 67%
of BRD's foreign exchange resource needs, from 1979 to 1980,
the on-lending rate of a second IDA credit would be a major
determinant of BRD's re-lending rates. If IDA were to require
the Rwandese Government to pass the proceeds of the proposed
credit to BRD at the full IBRD rate (presently 7.0%), as required
by the normal IBRD/IDA policy for lending to DFCs, then BRD would



- 18 -
have to raise its relending rates sharply. Such large in-
creases would be unduly inhibiting to investment in industry
and to BRD's growth (paras 2.10 and 2.27-2.29). Specifically,
it is agreed that:
(i) the on-lending rate will be 6% (as compared with 4% for
the first IDA credit);
(ii) the BRD will raise its relending rates (including
commission) to 8.5% on medium-term sub-loans to small-
scale enterprises 1/ and to 9% on medium term sub-loans
to all other enterprises (the present rate is 7% to all
enterprises), and to 10% on long-term sub-loans to
small-scale enterprises 1/ and to 11% on long-term sub-
loans to all other enterprises (the present rate is 9%
to all enterprises);
(iii) the BRD would be given total waiver of commitment fees,
as under the first IDA credit.
(d) Foreign Exchange Risk. The arrangements agreed at the time of
the first IDA credit to BRD, under which the Government would
assume the foreign exchange risk would be continued; and
(e) Amortization Schedule. In conformity with the normal IBRD/IDA
lending policy to DFCs, the proposed credit to BRD would
have a flexible amortization schedule that would substantially
conform with the aggregate of the amortization schedules of the
subloans and equity investments made by BRD and financed under
the proposed IDA credit, subject to a maximum of 20 years for
tourism projects and 15 years for all other projects, each
including a grace period not to exceed 5 years.
Other customary conditions and covenants for DFCs have been included in the
credit and project agreements. The limit on BRD's debt/equity ratio would
remain at 3:1.
Feasibility Study for Establishment of an Audit Firm
3.07      This project component is intended to help solve the problem of
lack of auditors in Rwanda (paras 2.12 and 2.14-2.15). Therefore, it is
proposed to include US$200,000 in the proposed second IDA credit as follows:
1/   A small-scale enterprise is defined as having (i) net assets (total
assets less amortization) of less than RwF15 million; (ii) annual
sales of less than RwF1O million; and (iii) less than 20 employees.



- 19 -
(a)  US$20,000 to finance five man-months of consultant's services
to conduct a feasibility study to determine if the establish-
ment of an auditing firm is justified, and, if so, to prepare
a plan for the establishment of such a firm, and its character,
taking into account the needs of both the private and public
sectors and the possibility of foreign participation; and
(b) US$35,000 for the purchase of equipment and furniture for the
premises of such a firm; and US$145,000 for the training of
its staff, either locally with the assistance of experts or
abroad in suitable training institutions. A decision on how
the funds would be provided would be made in consultation
with IDA during the review of the feasibility study.
The scope and terms of reference of the study should be acceptable to IDA, and
the decision whether to proceed with the establishment of the audit firm would
be made following agreement between the Government and IDA on the results of
the study. If the decision is not to proceed with the establishment of such a
firm, then the US$180,000 would be reallocated for use by BRD in financing its
projects.
D.   Project Costs and Financing
3.08      Total commitments under the project are estimated at US$15.3 mil-
lion, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.3 million. A summary is
shown in Table 2 below:
Table 2: Project Commitments

a/   Including contingencies.
3.09      IDA will finance US$200,000 of the total cost of the feasibility
study, which corresponds to 67% of the total and to the foreign exchange
component. The financing plan for BRD's operations is shown in Table 3
below.

Thus IDA would cover 67% of BRD's foreign resource gap, or 51% of the total
resource requirements.
E.   Project Implementation
3.10      BRD would be responsible for implementing the line-of-credit com-
ponent of the project and the MiniLstry of Finance would be responsible for
carrying out the feasibility study for establishment of an audit firm. This
Ministry may, if it chooses, request BRD to supervise on its behalf the
execution of the feasibility study.
3.11      Reporting Requirements.  BRD will submit to IDA semi-annual reports
which would include, among others, the following: financial statements,
arrears and resources position statements, progress of operations, and notes
on major subprojects experiencing difficulty, including the major conclusions
and recommendations of BRD's follow-up staff. Audited accounts prepared by
qualified accountants, acceptable to IDA in accordance with the Illustrative
Form for Development Finance Companies will be submitted to IDA along with the
annual report. The Government and BRD will also submit a report to IDA when
the project is completed.
3.12      Consultants.  The qualifications of the consultants undertaking
the feasibility study as well as those implementing its recommendations, and
the terms and conditions of their employment will be acceptable to IDA.
3.13      Procurement.  Procurement for the subprojects refinanced under the
credit will be in accordance with the standard practice for DFCs (para. 2.13).
3.14      Disbursement.  The proceeds of the proposed second credit would be
disbursed as follows:



- 21 -
(a)  BRD subloans:  (i) 100% of c.i.f. cost of goods and services
imported for eligible subprojects; (ii) up to 80% of the cost
of goods produced locally or previously imported and purchased
locally for the subprojects; and (iii) up to 65% of the total
cost of construction and civil works, representing the foreign
exchange component;
(b)  feasibility study:  (i) 100% of the foreign exchange expenditures
of consultant services and staff training; (ii) 100% of c.i.f.
costs of imported equipment; and (iii) 80% of the total cost of
previously imported equipment which is locally purchased.
The credit component is expected to be fully committed by December 31, 1980
and to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1982 (Annex 7).
F.   Benefits and Risks
3.15      Although the level of commercial/industrial investment has been
historically low, recently there has been significant growth in investment
interest in Rwanda in both the public and private sectors. This, therefore,
is a particularly appropriate time to assist BRD, not only in its development
as an efficient and independent allocator of resources but also to finance
the development of the productive sectors of the Rwandese economy. Under this
project IDA will seek to continue the development of BRD's appraisal capabili-
ties and supervision systems and procedures. As BRD is the major source of
foreign exchange term-finance and cooperates closely with Government, it can
have a significant impact on the design and development of projects in both
the public and private sectors.
3.16      There are no unusual major risks associated with this project.  For
a small development bank, BRD has quite a substantial pipeline of projects,
which should be sufficient to support the forecast level of approvals. The
rates of commitment and disbursement, which depend upon the progress of
implementation of subprojects, are expected to proceed as anticipated.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
4.01      This report recommends an IDA credit of US$5.2 million.  BRD would
receive US$5.0 million as a second IDA line-of-credit through the Government.
The remaining US$0.2 million would be allocated to the Ministry of Finance
to finance the feasibility study for the establishment of an audit firm in
Rwanda.



- 22 -
4.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached as follows:
(a)  From the Government to:
(i)  provide BRD with adequate guarantees in the case of those
public sector projects where BRD's financing exceeds its
normal exposure limit (para. 2.07);
(ii) the on-lending terms and conditions of the line of
credit (para. 3.06); and
(iii) carry out the feasibility study for establishment of an
audit firm (paras 3.07 and 3.10).
(b)  From BRD to:
(i) obtain in those cases where BRD's financing exceeds the
normal exposure limit adequate guarantees of repayment
of that portion of the loan that exceeds the normal limit
(para. 2.07);
(ii) the terms and conditions of the proposed line of credit
(para. 3.06).
4.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project is suitable
for an IDA credit of US$5.2 million.
