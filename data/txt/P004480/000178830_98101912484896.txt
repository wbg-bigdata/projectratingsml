DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
THIRD LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested the Bank Group's
assistance to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for financing a
third phase project - following two previous agricultural credit projects -
for promoting livestock and fisheries development. During their implementa-
tion over the past eight years, there has been significant growth in DBP's
institutional capabilities, and one of the principal objectives of this
project is to further enhance this growth through inclusion of a number of
institution-building provisions in the project. In a wider context, the
project would also provide support to the two subsectors' specialized
agencies within the Government responsible for the subsectors. The
project's credit component would support, through DBP, the continuation of
past nationwide efforts to promote commercial production of pork, poultry
and eggs.  In the cattle subsector, the project would promote beef and milk
production on a backyard basis at the village level, while encouraging the
overall increase in the national herd through support for breeding/fattening
operations on extensive pastures in a number of hilly areas of the country.
Fisheries development would emphasize the technical upgrading of existing
inland brackish-water fishponds, and support the modernization and expansion
of the marine fleet for previously underutilized marine waters, by employing
less costly fishing vessels, smaller than the average of the current
commercial fleet. The proposed loan of US$45 million would be made to
the Government of the Philippines for 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
US$41.3 million would be onlent to DBP on the same terms.
1.02      This will be the seventh Bank loan to DBP for agriculture./l  In
addition, a loan to support fisheries training at various levels has recently
been approved by the Board, while projects to strengthen supporting services
for agriculture (including livestock) and to strengthen support services for
fisheries in general and to develop infrastructure for artisanal fishermen are
currently under preparation.  Several other Bank projects provide support for
/1 See Annex 1, Table 1 for the list of projects and basic data on DBP.

irrigation and crop development, while livestock and fisheries are also
supported through agricultural credit loans to the Land Bank and the Rural
Banking System / (para. 1.11).
1.03      This loan proposal was prepared by the Government/Development
Bank of the Philippines with the assistance of FAO/CP and was appraised in
August/September 1979, by Messrs. J. Gregor (leader), B. Berman, S. Dass,
L. Sprague and Ms. T. Yip (Bank) and Messrs. R. Ayre-Smith, G. Irvin, K.
Neils and P. Wilson (consultants). Mr. G. Ablasser (Bank) assisted with
the final review of the project's economic aspects.
The Rural and Agricultural Sector
1.04      Some 31 million people, or 70% of the Philippine population live in
rural areas, where social services are poor, economic opportunities limited,
agricultural productivity often low and underemployment high. About 60% of
the population depend directly on agriculture. The rural population is
growing at 2.7% per year, reflecting a natural increase of about 3.2% and an
annual rate of migration to the cities of 0.5%.
1.05      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Philippine economy,
accounting for about 26% of GDP, slightly less than 50% of total employment,
and 50-60% of the foreign exchange earnings. Nearly three-quarters of the
land under cultivation is devoted to grains production, notably rice and corn;
other principal crops are sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapple and tobacco.
1.06      The major part of Philippines' agriculture comprises small-scale
farms. The national average landholding is about 3.6 ha. Most of the
nonmarginal lands, especially in the lowland areas, are under cultivation,
and agricultural development and improvement of farm incomes critically
depend on increased productivity of the already cultivated lands. Because
of the small average farm size, animal production consists predominantly of
backyard or small scale commercial /2 enterprises. It is estimated that
more than 80% of the pork and 70% of the beef consumed in the Philippines
come from these sources. Backyard animal production is characterized by
poor husbandry and management which, given the generally inferior types of
animals, result in low productivity.
1.07      Government Objectives.  Government's agricultural policy
emphasizes food production, agricultural diversification, reforestation and
stronger linkages between agriculture and industry. Key components of the
development strategy are (i) agrarian reform of rice and corn lands, (ii)
/1 Loans 423-PH, 607-PH, 1010-PH, 1399-PH, 1646-PH
/2 The line of demarcation between backyard and small scale enterprise is
not very clear. The principal difference is the proportion of feed
produced on the farm or in the backyard rather than bought.



-3-
rural infrastructure development, (iii) improved credit programs and (iv)
malnutrition prevention programs. Progress has already been achieved with
this strategy as is evident from increased farm production and a more
favorable growth rate of rural family incomes compared to incomes of urban
families. Nonetheless, of the 15 million people in the lower 40% of the
income scale, 12 million are found in the rural areas; 39% of the rural
population are poor compared with 23% of urban.
1.08      A major contribution towards achieving the objective of increased
production has been irrigation development. Improved technology for rice
cultivation has considerably raised the production potential of the
irrigated areas. With the achievement of self-sufficiency in food grain
production, agricultural development priorities are no longer focused
exclusively on major irrigation projects, especially since irrigation will
become increasingly expensive as more marginal areas are included.
1.09      In contrast to the continuous progress achieved in irrigation,
growth in the other food producing subsectors has not been satisfactory.
Government is now preparing a "Food and Nutrition Plan," a strategy for
accelerating food production and improving consumption. The Plan is
expected to provide a framework for the identification and preparation of
projects and programs,.generate greater internal and external resources and
policy support for such projects, and increase the Philippines' capacity to
implement food-related projects and programs. The work is being carried on
by various task forces and individuals from the Ministries of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
and the National Nutrition Council (NNC), with assistance from Bank staff.
1.10      Agricultural Credit.  As a result of the development of a country-
wide banking network and the implementation of government-sponsored credit
programs, there has been a gradual shift over the last few years from the non-
formal channels of credit to institutional sources of credit. The largest of
the government-owned institutions is the Philippine National Bank. Although
the bulk of its resources is channeled into the sugar industry, it plays a
leading role in providing short-term production credit to the various
government-sponsored agricultural programs. Other government-owned
institutions include the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the
major supplier of medium and long-term credit to agriculture. The Land Bank
of the Philippines /1 and the Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA) are
basically oriented towards small farmers, and provide financial support
to the beneficiaries of agrarian reform.
/1 Land Bank is the executing agency for the Small Farmers Development
Project, Loan No 1646-PH. The project became effective on 4/25/79 and
aims at increasing productivity and incomes of small farmers through
provision of credit, coordinated delivery of technical assistance and
improved infrastucture. It also includes measures to strengthen Land
Bank field operations.



-4-
1.11      Among the privately-owned institutions involved in agriculture are
commercial banks, rural banks, private development banks (PDBs), savings and
loan associations and savings and mortgage banks. The rural banks provide a
wide geographical coverage, have relatively low overhead costs and maintain
close links with their farmer-borrowers. However, many of these banks are
financially weak. Their lending operations generally cover a broad range of
government-sponsored agricultural programs and are mostly geared to short-
term production financing with the exception, however, of the Central Bank/
IBRD Rural Credit Projects /1 for medium- and long-term financing of farm
machinery, livestock and poultry development. The PDBs, which are generally
located in the provinces, provide finance to small-scale enterprises and
farmers through mobilization of long-term resources. A recent restructuring
of the ongoing Fourth Rural Credit Project (Loan 1399-PH) enables PDBs to
become lending intermediaries under the Project through access to the
Central Bank's rediscount facility for term loans.
1.12      Agricultural credit programs in the Philippines form part of an
Integrated Agricultural Credit Plan which covers the period 1977-1982 and
which is overseen by the Presidential Committee on Agricultural Credit.
Within the framework of the Plan, annual plans are established and evaluated.
The Plan covers both production and term credit, and takes into account all
credit programs implemented by public and private institutions. Formal
agricultural credit rose from P 5.7 billion in 1971 to P 12.1 billion in
1978, with about 95% of loans having terms of less than one year. In 1978
about 43% of all lending was for the production, processing and marketing of
sugar, 29% for food commodities in general - of which 10% was for livestock
and fisheries - and the remaining 28% for other activities. The Philippine
National Bank accounted for 42% of total lending, followed by commercial
banks with 29% and DBP and rural banks with 20% and 5%, respectively. The
remaining 5% was shared by other institutions.
/1 First Rural Credit Project, Loan 423-PH of US$5.0 million provided
medium- and long-term finance to farmers and fishermen through 140
rural banks.
Second Rural Credit Project, Loan 607-PH of US$12.5 million was similar
to the first project but, in addition, it also provided finance for
storage and processing and on-farm transportation equipment.
Third Rural Credit Project, Loan 1010-PH of US$22.5 million added new
subloan categories, mainly for farm machinery workshops, reconditioned
trucks, fishmeal plants and woodcraft plants, fishpens and small dairy
farming.
Fourth Rural Credit Project Loan 1399-PH of US$36.5 million continues
the activities of the previous projects in that it finances farm
mechanization, light transportation, cottage and agro-industries,
coastal and inland fisheries and small-scale livestock development.
Effective date:  6/2/77.  Closing date:  12/31/80.



-5-
1.13      DBP's agricultural lending covers commercial crops, food crops,
livestock, fisheries, grain processing and storage. Its agricultural
portfolio on December 31, 1978 included about 5% of loans maturing in one year
or less, 58% in one to five years, 33% in five to ten years, and 4% in over
ten years. It provides about 20% of all institutional lending for livestock
and 30% of lending for fisheries on a nationwide basis. DBP's volume of all
agricultural loans approved runs at about P 500 million per year.
Animal Protein Subsector
1.14      Demand.  Estimates of the population growth rate for the Philippines
imply a 1985 population of 57 million, or one fourth higher than the 46
million estimate for 1978. At the same time, per capita income is expected to
grow in real terms by 3% p.a. As a result, the national demand for animal
protein in 1985 is estimated to increase by 42% over 1978 for beef, with a
corresponding increase of 40% for pork, 37% for chicken and 30% for fish.
1.15      Supply.  Tables 1.1 and 1.2 show the trend in livestock population
and fisheries catch since 1976. It is significant that in spite of
substantial annual growth rates in the commercial sector (in part supported
by previous Bank loans) the overall annual growth of total cattle and carabao
population has not kept pace with overall human population increases. How-
ever, commercialization has had a significant impact on the number of pigs and
poultry and, therefore,on total supply. For fish, the growth in marine catch
has slowed, while the impact of investments in the inland fisheries subsector
is just becoming evident.

/b  Derived from trend fitting over past five years.  However, reliable
data for the municipal catch is only recently becoming available, rates
of growth are therefore notional, and are based on a simple extra-
polation of a weak statistical base. Future rates of growth in this
sector are uncertain but are not expected to be greater than about
4-5%. Aggregate growth rates for the sector as a whole are expected
to be about 4.1%.
1.16      Domestic production (supply) projections for fish, pork, chicken
and beef are shown in Table 1.3 and compared with demand estimates. In the
case of fish production increases of about 4% a year may be expected in the
fish catch from all sources, thereby keeping demand and supply in balance,
but resource depletion in areas which are heavily fished (particularly, but
not exclusively, by artisanal fishermen), vessel obsolescence and growing
exports could all result in curtailing supply to the domestic market. While
the incremental production attributable to the project would only be 1.1%
of the total fish supply, DBP's lending should nevertheless be based on a
careful assessment of the market for incremental production. In contrast, a
shortfall is likely to occur by 1985 in the supply of meat, amounting to about
16% for pork, 19% for chicken and 24% for beef if no new investments are
undertaken. The prospects of new investments depend on Government policy with
regard to prices. In recent years the Government has been reluctant to allow

prices to be determined solely by market forces. However, its price
stabilization programs have tended to be short-lived, and prices have
invariably caught up with rising costs.
Subsector Trends
1.17      Pigs and Poultry.  Past investments were made to satisfy an under-
supply and, consequently, experienced a favorable market and relatively
large profit margins. Over the last twelve to eighteen months, however, the
rising costs of feed (due to increasing international price of corn) and
fuel, and a more competitive market place have lowered the profit margins.
There is evidence that some of the smaller ventures have either closed, or
have been taken over by some of the large integrators /1 who dominate the
commercial sector.
1.18      The integrators have responded by moving increasingly to mixed
feeds with higher proportions of local low cost ingredients as substitute
for corn, while small-scale operators have added farm byproducts to their
feeding regimes. The smaller- and medium-scale operators who do not have
access to farm byproducts or to large quantities of local feed ingredients
have had to rely on commercial sources for their feeds, and thus their cost
structure has changed significantly for the worse. Joint ownership of small
feed mixing plants by such operators is now being tried as a strategy to
overcome this problem and, if successful, would be supported by the project
(para. 4.26). The subsector will, in the future, place an increasing demand
on nontraditional feed ingredients (rice bran, ipil-ipil leaves, sugarcane
tops etc.); these can be supplied either on a countrywide basis (rice bran)
or only in specific production areas (sugarcane tops), and the Bureau of
Animal Industry will intensify its extension efforts and research in this
field to ensure that adequate corn/local ingredient feed mixes are
established for each region. Funds for local feed mills are available from
DBP under the Bank - financed Second Grain Processing project./2
1.19      Increases in fuel costs are now having a noticeable impact on
marketing costs. The previous trend in commercial production to view Manila
as the major market and ship into Manila over relatively long distances is
likely to be less evident in the future. A trend towards regionalization
of markets seems to be developing. However, these markets are currently
predominantly supplied from the backyard sector (Table 1.1), whose costs are
significantly lower than those of commercial operators. Whereas regional
hog prices are currently at levels that are profitable for the backyard
operators, these are not satisfactory for many commercial operators.
Regional commercially-marketed mixed feeds prices are higher than those in
Manila, further eroding the regional operators' profit position. However,
rising costs of transporting livestock to the more lucrative Manila market

will gradually force the operator to seek local markets. To be able to
operate profitably in these regional markets, the commercial operator will
have to reduce his cost by using local feed ingredients whose availability
varies from region to region.
1.20      The emergence of the large integrators is allowing for increasing
specialization by the medium-scale operators. This has led to an "outgrower"
function where the integrator supplies infant stock, feeds and guarantees a
market price. In other cases, the medium-scale operators are buying infant
stock, and a day old chick industry has become established in the major urban
areas. This is allowing for some economies of scale but, as this specializa-
tion has not yet begun in the regions more distant from Manila (where the
total market size may yet be too small to support such operations), this
opportunity for regional cost reduction could only be expected some time in
the future.
1.21      Cattle.  The national herd was severely depleted during and
immediately after World War II and has to date not been rebuilt to an
adequate level. Most investors in cattle have tended to view their herds as
a capital investment, and maintained their stock on extensive pastures for
prolonged fattening. The Government is now beginning to encourage the
dispersal of young stock among villagers for fattening and sale for
slaughter at about 18 to 24 months. This is creating a market for weaner
stock that is now encouraging the traditional investors to place young stock
on the market. The Government expects that this will, in turn, result in
the traditional investors increasing the proportion of breeding females in
their herds, and thus begin the long process of building up the base
national herd.  The Bureau of Animal Industry is undertaking a number of
programs to encourage both the traditional investors and village level
cattle operations (see para. 4.17, Noncredit Components), including the
introduction of upgraded breed stock that will increase milk productivity.
The intention is to encourage the acceptance of "multipurpose" cattle, rather
than specialization in either beef or dairy cattle.
1.22      Marine Fisheries.  The commercial operators' response to the
recent large increase in investment and operating costs for vessels and
decline in catch per unit of effort due to the gradual expansion of fleet
capacity over the last decade indicate that the following trends will
determine new investment decisions over the life of this project:
(a)  shift in preference to smaller vessels which are better able to
achieve catch levels commensurate with their capacity;
(b)  shift from trawling to purse seining, primarily because of
fuel savings;
(c)  attempts to achieve economies of scale through professional
fleet management and savings in transportation costs by using
carrier vessels;



- 11 -
(d) continuation of the development of the more distant fishing
ports and fishing grounds for domestic catch and growing
importance of regional urban centers as markets for fish; and
(e) growing importance in the catch of high value export species,
particularly tuna, brought about by technological changes
in purse seine fishing; and this has attracted both new capital
and caused a shift in capital resources from the "domestic" fleet
to the "tuna" fleet. In addition there appears an opportunity
for banca fishermen, utilizing hook and line gear, to fish for
deep swimming tuna, inaccessible to purse seine. Because deep
water is found extraordinarily close to the coast of the
eastern shore (see Map), this canoe fishery for tuna is
virtually unique in terms of its seasonal and specialized nature
and it is, therefore, limited to banca fishermen in those areas.
1.23      Investments are, therefore, expected to be in smaller vessels,
predominantly to replace large older vessels and in new fishing gear and for
refitting of larger vessels. New large vessel investment is expected only
for specialized tuna fishing.
1.24      The Government, through the Fisheries Industries Development
Council (FIDC), will provide technical advice to the commercial operators to
encourage shifts in the choice of gear, vessel size and design to that which
research indicates to be the most effective. The Bureau of Fisheries and
Aquatic Resources' (BFAR) assistance will be concentrated on the artisanal
fisheries development, encouraging fishing in traditional areas with
improved gear and basically traditional boats (larger outrigger canoe type)
and small trawlers (12 GT). The upgrading of some of the p<ogressive
artisanal fishermen to ownership of such vessels will be -tempted.  In
addition, both production credit and rural infrastructure development are
now being undertaken to support artisanal fisheries, and especially to
strengthen their market access. The infrastructure/services program is
currently being prepared for future consideration for Bank funding.
1.25      Inland Fisheries.   For fishpond culture the past strategy of
production of milkfish (chanos chanos) in brackish water ponds is now being
broadened to include fresh water culture (using tilapia nilotica) in the
inland irrigated rice fields to provide fresh fish supplies to areas that
traditionally had to rely on dried and salted marine catch or imported canned
mackerel. For brackish water fishponds, due to a desire to limit further
exploitation of coastal mangrove swamp land, emphasis will be placed on
increasing productivity in already established fishponds. In certain
specially designated "depressed areas" new fishpond development may be
undertaken.
1.26      Brackish water fishpond operators have experienced escalating
construction and operating costs, not compensated by a corresponding rise in
the farm-gate price of the fish produced. The reduced profit margin is now



- 12 -
highlighting the importance of improving yields from existing facilities
through improved capital facilities and effective pond management with
improved technical practices thus reducing unit costs. A recent change in
the regulations governing the awarding of fishpond leases will enable
conversion of one and ten-year leases to a term of 25 years, thus creating a
better investment climate. Conditions of these conversions have been
liberalized and it can, therefore, be anticipated that DBP will over the
next two or three years be involved in financing a substantial amount of
incremental investments on fishponds established on leaseholds previously of
short duration and currently being operated with minimal and technically
inadequate capital investment. While Government is also moving in the
direction of making a very limited amount of additional mangrove areas
available for new leases, investments in new ponds will be limited to areas
with comparative advantage in terms of manpower, marketing infrastructure
and management experience of the entrepreneur. Because of the narrowing
profit margin and the importance of economies of scale, it is unlikely that
very many new small fishponds would be constructed unless there are specific
local favorable factors.  In general, the bulk of DBP fishpond loans can be
expected to assist the rehabilitation or additional construction to enhance
production of existing fishponds.
1.27      Government, through MNR and NEDA, is also currently examining
the feasibility of constructing fishpond estates from mangrove areas, as the
economic and physical infrastructure basis for new rural communities. The
economic and financial viability of such estates is dependent on the
locality, the scope of engineering involved and experience with managing
such estates. Government is also considering entrusting such developments
to local semi-autonomous development authorities, which, because of their
legal status, would be entitled to borrow from DBP on their owrn account.
Their creditworthiness would, however, be sUbject to DBP's approval. If
such estates can be shown to be viable and the local development authority
proves to be creditworthy, DBP could utilize the proceeds from the loan to
finance such developments.
2. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
Sectoral Agencies
2.01      Ministry of Agriculture_(MOA):  Within MOA, responsibility for
livestock development is vested in the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI),
supported by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAEcon) for planning data,
and the Bureau of Plant Industries (BPI) for feedstock services. BAI operates
its own field extension and veterinarian staff.  BAI provides technical
support to DBP and other agricultural credit institutions for their live-
stock lending programs.  This project would provide support for a limited



- 13 -
number of BAI activities, considered necessary for the subsector as a whole.
Another project which has recently been appraised by the Bank /1 would, inter
alia, further strengthen the services that BAI provides.
2.02      Ilinistry of Natural Resources (MINGR).    The fisheries resources are
under the jurisdiction of MNR./2 Responsibility is vested with the Fisheries
Industries Development Council (FIDC) for sectoral planning and development,
and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) for sector regula-
tion, extension, statistics and research. BFAR currently provides a limited
amount of support to DBP for the latter's fisheries credit programs. Govern-
ment is currently preparing a project /3 for Bank support to broaden and
strengthen BFAR's support to the sector.  This project would provide limited
support to FIDC for its program of modernizing the deepsea subsector.
Financial Intermediaries
2.03      Institutional agricultural credit for the livestock and fisheries
subsectors is available through the commercial banks, the rural banking
system, the Land Bank, DBP and the private development banks. Past Bank
lending has supported the development of the agricultural credit intermed-
iaries, and support for these subsectors has been one of many activities
covered by these institution specific loans.
Interagency Coordination
2.04      Coordination of the agricultural credit institutions with
Government sectoral and other agencies is through the Presidential Committee
on Agricultural Credit (PCAC), whose Chairman and Vice-Chairman are the
Central Bank Governor and the Minister of Agriculture respectively. Other
members include the Ministers of Natural Resources, Local Government and
Community Development, Agrarian Reform, the Director General of the National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA), the Chairman of DBP and heads of
other Government agricultural credit institutions. PCAC is responsible for
formulating policies pertaining to agricultural credit, coordination among
the credit institutions and agencies concerned, and decision on priorities
for credit, particularly where public funds are involved. The Committee's
Technical Board on Agricultural Credit (TBAC) is concerned with quantifying
demand and supply for agricultural credit, monitoring its flow and
forecasting the requirements of different subsectors. It acts as
secretariat to the PCAC. Future development of projects on a sectoral
or subsectoral basis, as envisaged for the proposed project, will require
a corresponding rationalization within the agricultural financing sector.

This will contrast with the previous practice of developing agricultural
credit projects on an institution-specific basis. Thus the provision of
credit to a sector would require a broader planning function for the
determination of multi-institutional participation. Although DBP will
continue to be a major channel for Bank-assisted projects, it is also becoming
increasingly evident that there is no clear line of demarcation between the
respective roles of the various institutions involved in agricultural credit,
particularly for term lending. The Bank's lending for agriculture through DBP
will increasingly be consolidated, as is being done in the proposed project,
and it is planned to move towards a single consolidated loan to DBP for agri-
culture by about 1985. It is also proposed to review the Bank's association
with all credit channels in the Philippines with a view to rationalizing the
arrangements. This can only be accomplished, however, within the context of a
comprehensive review by the Government of the entire credit mechanism,
including large segments with which the Bank is not involved. It is proposed
to discuss this subject as part of a proposed financial sector review which
would analyze the supply-demand relationships in agricultural finance as well
as the role of the concerned institutions.
The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
2.05      General.  DBP is well known to the Bank as the credit channel for
seven agricultural and five industrial projects financed by the Bank during
the seventies./I It was set up by the Republic Act 2081 in 1958 as an
autonomous, fully Government-owned bank for reconstruction and development of
the agricultural and industrial sectors. It has since become the largest
supplier of medium- and long-term agricultural credit in the country, although
its agricultural loan portfolio represents only about 20% of DBP's total
loans, with industry and other loans accounting for 50% and 30% respectively.
In view of its past experience and the special role assigned to it by Govern-
ment, it is at this stage the logical choice as executing agency for the
proposed broadly conceived agricultural credit project.
2.06      DBP is controlled by a Board of Governors consisting of nine mem-
bers, appointed by the President of the Philippines. The Chairman and four
full time Supervising Governors constitute DBP's top management team.   There
are four part-time Governors. The Chairman exercises line control through the
four Supervising Governors, each of whom is in charge of several departments.
(see Top Management Organizational Chart). DBP has 4,800 employees divided
equally between its Mfakati (Metro Manila) head office and its 40 branches,
12 subbranches and 7 agencies.
2.07      Agricultural Lending.  At the head office all matters relating to
agriculture are handled by two Agricultural Projects Departments, APD I for
crops and processing and APD II for livestock and fisheries. Agriculture
Plans and Programs Staff Department (APPS) coordinates monitoring and
evaluation for agriculture projects. At its inception in 1977 its role was
envisaged as embracing both the macro- and micro-economic studies of various
agricultural subsectors, with the objective of identifying and preparing
investment programs, in addition to coordinating project reporting and their

ex-post evaluation. Due to staffing constraints its role has so far been
limited. Regional lending is administered by DBP's branches, controlled at
headquarters by the Branches and Agencies Departments (BAAD I and II).
2.08      DBP Resources.  These have almost doubled over the last three years,
growing from P 11.1 billion in June 1976 to P 19.9 billion by June 1979.
In absolute terms, the largest increase was in the long-term borrowing
category, which grew by P 4.4 billion to P 10.9 billion during the
three-year period, while declining in relation to the total resources from
about 59% to 55%. These funds have been drawn almost equally from domestic
and foreign sources, with IBRD now accounting for about 24% of the foreign
funds. In relative terms, the largest increase took place in the short-term
deposit category (P 0.7 billion to P 3.2 billion) or from about 6% to
16%. The share of equity declined from about 20% of total resources to 18%
in the three years. The paid-up capital increased from P 2.0 billion to
P 2.9 billion and accumulated reserves grew from P 286 million to
P 654 million./l   Further increases in the paid-up capital are planned and
P 4.0 billion under this heading is expected to be reached by 1981, as
required by IBRD loan agreement 1572-PH, under which US$80 million is
provided to DBP for industrial lending. Over the last year or so DBP has
found it increasingly difficult to raise long-term domestic funds, parti-
cularly after its "Countryside Bonds" lost their income tax exemption with
their fourth issue in January 1979. (Table 2 of Annex 1 contains DBP's
summarized annual accounts.)
2.09      Use of Resources.  Lending for agriculture as a proportion of
DBP's total loan portfolio /2 declined from 24.3% to 19.4% during the three
years to June 30, 1979. This decline has been offset mainly by increased
lending for industrial projects, whose proportion rose from 46.0% to 49.4%,
as well as all other nonagricultural loans, which rose from 29.7% to 31.2%.
In the broader context of total assets, a shift towards larger current
assets and investments in equities and bonds can be observed; the two grew
from P 2.1 billion and P 0.8 billion to P 4.1 billion and P 2.1
billion, respectively (Annex 1, Table 2).
2.10      The slowdown in agricultural lending can be attributed largely to
DBP's involvement in "social loans" and collection efforts pertaining to
them, which diverted a substantial portion of staff and other resources to
this task from mid-1977 onwards. Another activity undertaken on a massive
scale was an overall review of the portfolio in 1977, including evaluation of
collateral values, to determine an appropriate provision for insufficiently
covered loans. In numbers of accounts, agriculture outweighs by far other
lending categories. Table 2.1 illustrates this point.
/L   This does not include 20% of net income converted annually into paid-
up capital.
/2   Excludes Acquired Assets and Loans Under Litigation but includes
Contract MIortgage Receivable category.

12% p.a. for loans secured by land and one at 14% p.a.
not so secured.  The exact number of borrowers cannot be
ascertained under the existing system.
2.11      Agricultural Portfolio.  DBP's agricultural loan portfolio shows a
higher percentage of arrears than its other lending categories (Annex 1,
Table 3). However, when distortions such as the "social loans" and large
loans to two insolvent agricultural companies and other distorting factors
(para. 2.12) are removed, the arrears' ratio is probably about 22%. For an
organization of DBP's broadly based involvement in agriculture the magnitude
of DBP's arrears is generally in line with the experience of other
institutions in the Philippines and that of comparable institutions in most of
the developing countries. By age of arrears, agriculture appears to be in a
better position than the overall DBP loan portfolio. For instance, 76% of
agricultural arrears were less than three years old, compared to DBP as a
whole with 56% as of June 30, 1979. Corresponding percentages for the
Bank-financed livestock and fisheries projects were 92% and 97%. DBP is
committed to improving the arrears situation and various actions have been
taken over the last two years. Various studies have been undertaken in the
Philippines to determine the causes of arrears and of remedies to improve
repayments of agricultural loans./I For its part, DBP has made a good start
with the monitoring and evaluation study under the second livestock project.
It is essential that this study be continued and broadened under the proposed
project (para. 4.28).
2.12      Table 2.2 shows past dues as percentage of loans outstanding for
agriculture, industry and for DBP as a whole from 1972 onward. To remove a
major distortion (P 422 million as of June 30, 1979), the table also shows
/1  For instance, the Central Bank/IBRD Fourth Rural Credit (Loan 1399-PH)
financed such a study in 1978 (Staff Working Paper No. 2).



- 17 -
percentages for "social loans" /1 made to some 100,000 farmers and fishermen
between 1975 and 1978 at the behest of Government, which have proved to be
largely uncollectable. The Government has since agreed to reimburse DBP for
these defaults and to this end has established a Trust Fund with DBP to be
funded over nine years at P 100 million for the first year (1980) and
P 50 million during each of the subsequent eight years. Another
distortion arose out of extremely high penalty charges introduced under the
Bank-financed Second Industrial Loan (1190-PH), signed in 1976, which
required DBP to charge a penalty interest of 3% per month on all overdue
accounts to combat the possible diversion of borrowed funds by DBP clients
into the money market, where shortage of domestic funds pushed short-term
rates well beyond 25%./2 The net result was that many loans, particularly in
agriculture, have built up exorbitant arrears in a very short time and often
beyond the borrower's capacity to repay. Another distorting factor is
P 109.1 million of arrears of two large accounts of insolvent enterprises.
The picture is also obscured by mechanical conversion of large numbers of
accounts with varying types of amortizations and due dates to a common base,
which exaggerates the situation even though the accounts are only a few days
in arrears.
/1 The largest of the social loans are the "Selda Foreshore Fisheries" and
the "Irrigation Pump" schemes. The former provided funds for motorizing
the small municipal fishermen's bancas and the latter aimed at increasing
rice production of the small farmer.
/2 In early 1979 the penalty rate was lowered, with Bank's agreement, to
8% p.a., for loans up to P 3 million and 16% p.a. for loans above
P 3 million. This penalty charge is over and above additional interest
on the amount in arrears at the basic loan interest rate.

2.13      Arrears Reduction Plan.  DBP's current plan, endorsed by the
mission, is for each Branch Manager to review the status of each agricul-
tural program to determine, in conjunction with his Regional Manager,
actions to be taken and the assistance needed from the head office in this
regard. The emphasis-is on selectivity under specific programs and
concentration on arrears where amounts are substantial and the loans are
older. A new group consisting of ten senior staff has been established at
the head office Branches and Agencies Department to oversee this operation
and make recommendations on further actions. This represents a new approach
from that pursued previously, when collection efforts were blunted by
tackling the entire agricultural sector (which included over 100,000
uncollectable "social loans"). The new approach should be more effective
for ascertaining causes common to specific projects and it should therefore
enable development of appropriate collection tactics and financial control
measures. Future actions concerning arrears reduction are spelled out in
para. 3.13.
2.14      Financial Results.  The financial year ended December 31, 1978 shows
a loan interest income of P 970.3 million, representing 64.1% of the total



- 19 -
of P 1,513.9 million (Table 2.3). Agriculture provided P 132.8 million or
8.8% of the interest total. (DBP's practice is to show as interest income
only interest actually collected). Over the last three years, the share of
the collected loan interest income has been gradually growing (FY75/76, 49.3%
of total income, FY78, 64.1%), while income from other sources has
proportionately declined. The table below focuses on three financial years
and reflects the earning results of the various types of assets. Further
details and ratios are shown in Table 2 of Annex 1. In general, the table
reflects the growth of DBP's resources; its income from all sources grew by
86% over the three years but its expenses have grown faster, by 98%./1
Consequently, the net income has declined proportionately, showing a growth
of only 22.4% over the three years.
/1 The increase in expense arose mainly from increased borrowings.

2.15      Financial Condition.  DBP's debt to equity ratio, including
guarantees, has remained stable over the past three years at around 5:1 and
thus well below its authorized ceiling of 10:1. Its current assets to current
liabilities ratio, which declined fom 1.1:1 in June 1976 to 0.7:1 by the end
of FY78, rose to 0.9:1 in June 1979. If deposits subject to rollover are
included in the current liabilities, the ratio shows a slight improvement when
the June 1976 and June 1979 balance sheets are compared, namely 0.5:1 rising
to 0.8:1. The summarized balance sheets (Annex 1, Table 2) show a gradual
decline in short-term deposits subject to rollover, which decreased from
E 2.6 billion to P 139.8 million in the three years since June 30, 1976.



- 21 -
These are mainly Government funds which have gradually been transformed into
short-term deposits without the rollover promise. This structural change
places extra demands on liquidity planning, although massive withdrawals by
Government are unlikely./l
2.16      Accounting and Reporting.  DBP's annual financial statements are
normally completed within four months of the end of its financial year.
They convey satisfactorily the status of its wide ranging assets and liabili-
ties and the results for the year under review. The present system is not
geared, however, to provision of information on specific projects' status and
results. Consequently, annual financial statements concerning, for instance,
Bank-financed projects require redesigning (for future actions see
para. 4.38).
2.17      Auditing.  DBP is subject to statutory audit by Government's Com-
mission on Audit (COA), whose representative (Corporate Auditor) has a full
time function at DBP's head office and whose employees are attached as a
standard feature throughout DBP, branches included. The Bank's Industrial
Development and Finance Division has over the last three years worked closely
with the Corporate Auditor on various matters, mainly the injection of more
modern analytical methods and the streamlining of procedures. Progress to
date is satisfactory (see also para. 4.39 for future action).
3. PAST LENDING FOR LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES
Review of Previous Projects
3.01      The formulation of the proposed project's concept reflects the
experience of the two livestock and the two fisheries projects financed by
the Bank through DBP to date.
3.02      First and Second Livestock Development Projects.  The first project
(Loan 823-PH), of US$ 7.5 million signed in May 1972, was to provide finance
through DBP to some 1,450 small and medium size pig, poultry and integrated
coconut/beef cattle farms, 25 hill beef cattle breeding ranches, three
slaughterhouses, and for technical services. The project was completed and
the loan was fully disbursed by September 1976, some two years ahead of
schedule. The Second Livestock project (Loan 1225-PH) provided funds through
DBP for the establishment of 2,950 piggery, poultry, coconut/beef and
hill/beef farms. Funds were also provided for ten municipal slaughterhouses
(also authorized under the first project but never taken up due to general
/1 During negotiations of the Third Industrial Loan (1592-PH) the Bank
reached an understanding with the Government that the latter would take
due account of DBP's liquidity situation before withdrawal of its
deposits from DBP.



-22 -
financial constraints of the municipalities), and research, and development
of a feed quality control program by the Bureau of Animal Industry.
About 90% of the project funds has been committed and the project will be
fully disbursed by June 1981, a year ahead of Closing Date.
3.03      First and Second Fisheries Development Projects.  The first project,
signed in May 1973, provided US$11.6 million (Loan 893-PH) through DBP to
fisheries operators for procurement of fishing vessels and gear, iceplants and
slipways, and the development of fishponds. Funds were also provided for
various studies and a training program in support of future fisheries sector
investments. The project funds were fully disbursed by August 1979, two
months after the original Closing Date. Due to rapidly escalating costs, none
of the 15 projected steel vessels (130 GT class) were built. In the 70 GT
class only 35 fishing boats were constructed, ten less than projected. Only
one iceplant subloan and one slipway project were approved. In the inland
sector the project was to finance rehabilitation of about 4,500 ha of
flood-damaged fishponds and construction of about 7,500 ha new fishponds, a
total of 12,000 ha. The total financed by DBP grew to 15,000 ha, thus
exceeding the appraisal target.
3.04      The second project (Loan 1270-PH) is a continuation of the first
one.  The loan which was signed on July 2, 1976, made available US$12.0
million for the construction of fully equipped fishing vessels, conversion of
second-hand vessels into fish carriers, construction of three ice plants with
cold storage and a slipway. For the inland component the project provided
credit for the construction of new fishponds and expansion and rehabilitation
of existing fishponds. The loan was fully committed in Mlarch 1979 and by
November 1979 US$6.2 million remained to be disbursed by future progress
payments. Disbursements are expected to be completed by September 1980 or
nine months ahead of Closing Date. The subloans approved in the marine sector
include 18 purse seiners of sizes between 12 and 100 GT and 15 trawlers
between 12 and 145 GT (10 of 90 GT). This is in excess of appraisal esti-
mates, which forecast a total of 17 fishing vessels; on the other hand, no
fish carriers were financed and only one iceplant was constructed. In the
inland sector, 637 loans totalling P 89.0 million were approved and progress
payments as of June 30, 1979 amounted to 1 55.6 million. This is in line
with appraisal expectations.
Experience with Past Projects
3.05      The experience arising out of the execution of the previous
livestock and fisheries projects over the last eight years is summarized
below under three main headings: (a) DBP's institutional development,
(b) interagency coordination and (c) implementation experience.
DBP's Institutional Development
3.06      Organization.  The establishment of the Livestock and Poultry
Group under the first livestock project and the strengthening of the
Fisheries Group under the first fisheries project were significant steps



- 23 -
towards changing the Agricultural Projects Department from an administrative
and loan processing department into a technically oriented unit with pro-
fessional staff appraising the viability of subprojects, supervising their
execution and providing technical assistance to subborrowers. Under the
second livestock project reliance was placed on the continuation of the
Livestock and Poultry Group and also a new cooperative agreement between DBP
and the Bureau of Animal Industry. In the second fisheries project the
Fisheries Group was further strengthened by additional technical staff and
cooperation with the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources was further
developed. In general, the implementation of the first and second projects
marked DBP's substantially deeper involvement in the two subsectors with a
gradual build up of in-house appraisal and supervision expertise in the face
of many difficulties, particularly those related to the recruitment of
qualified staff. For a rapidly growing institution concerned, among other
matters, with loan collections, promotion of various large and socially
oriented programs and broadening of its activities through an increasing
number of branches, the build-up of DBP's staff and its general performance
were satisfactory.
3.07      As the institution grew, the organizational arrangements continued
to be adapted as needed. Head office technical staff continued to handle
MIetro Manila lending and, until 1976, also approvals of all branch subloan
applications, when branches were given authority to approve applications up
to P 150,000./i However, these were still required to be ratified ex-post by
the head office. The growing volume of branch lending of uneven quality
imposed a substantial administrative burden on the head office technical
staff. Various remedial steps were taken, including training programs,
reorganization of branch technical departments, assignments of responsibility
within the head office, and back-up administrative procedures. While the
Agricultural Projects Department II at the head office increased its staff
during this time and handled all administrative aspects of lending, its role
as a quality control center, policy designer and interpreter, and provider of
technical assistance did not grow concurrently, principally because of the
pressures of day-to-day operational involvement of the senior head office
staff.
3.08       In the meantime, the Branches and Agencies Departments, responsible
for branch administration, began to develop their strength by adding tech-
nical staff to their supervisory wings and began to examine technical aspects
of subproject implementation. Thus, after 1977, they began to fill a vacuum
left by APD II's heavy involvement in day-to-day transactions, through their
Branch Management Audit function. The proposed project would support DBP's
plans to realign the responsibilities of APD II and the BAADs by entrusting
responsibility for aspects covering lending to the latter, and making APD II
responsible for the quality of branch appraisal, supervision and technical
/1 Recently increased to P 300,000. Applications between P 300,000 and
P 500,000 are now subject to approval by RegionaL Managers.



- 24 -
assistance to subborrowers. Given their control over branch resources and
staffing, the Branches and Agencies Departments would thus have implicit
responsibility for the results of the branch operations in every respect,
including status of the branch loan portfolio, subborrowers' repayment
performance and all administrative matters.
3.09      The creation of the Agricultural Plans and Programs department
(APPS) in 1977 was an important step to fill a basic need for a specialized
economic unit, capable of interpreting the macro- and micro-economic
environment for DBP's agricultural lending operations. Various studies have
been undertaken to date, and of particular importance is the current
monitoring and evaluation sample survey under the second livestock project
(with assistance of consultants). Further strengthening of this department
is planned by DBP and this would enable it to play an important role in the
proposed project.
3.10      The experience with past organizational arrangements has led DBP
to conclude that the Agricultural Projects Department should divest itself
of all lending operations (by the creation of a Mietro Manila branch) and
restructuring its management to handle three basic functions: (a) policy
design and interpretation, (b) quality control over branch lending, and (c)
technical assistance to branches. The Branches and Agencies Department's
responsibilities will be extended to functions covering all branch
activities, except for technical quality control. The Agricultural Plans
and Programs Staff Department will enhance its contribution as an agro-
economic unit.
3.11      Financial and Administrative.  In terms of financial administra-
tion DBP is a well-organized, stable institution. In its plans for the future
DBP intends to replace its current accounting and reporting system by a new
management information system capable of recording and interpreting the
progress of specific programs by individual branches. Detailed terms of
reference for this major overhaul were prepared in mid-1978. Actions to
initiate the creation of the new management information system have been taken
and the proposed project makes appropriate provisions to complete this
essential exercise.
3.12      Other Institutional MIatters.  DBP is planning a further develop-
ment of its internal audit functions introduced during the last two years.
In the past the head office internal audit worked separately from the branch
unit, both reporting to different Supervising Governors. The internal audit
function will be reviewed in conjunction with the development of the new
management information system.
3.13      DBP continues to place emphasis on debt collection.  It has been
shown over time that massive collection drives do not produce results
commensurate with the effort. The monitoring and evaluation studies will, in
the medium term, provide important insights into the principal causes of



- 25 -
arrears, but for the short term the only practical course is a greater degree
of concentration on defaulters under specific projects in specific branches
(paras. 2.13 and 5.07).
3.14      DBP is currently planning the establishment of a small but dynamic
corporate planning unit for DBP as a whole, to ensure cohesion in the
formulation of DBP's global strategy.  The proposed project will support this
development which should take place as a natural outgrowth of activities
undertaken by the APPS (agriculture) and the Business Research Department
(industry and other).
Interagency Relationships
3.15      DBP's technical capabilities have been strengthened during the past
two years by closer cooperation with the Bureau of Animal Industry and the
Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. The former has during the last two
years provided technical staff on secondment, and a similar but more recent
arrangement was made with the latter. Past experience indicates the need for
further strengthening of these relationships between DBP head office
management and the Bureaux' headquarters as well as DBP's branch management
and the Bureaux' regional/provincial offices. Similarly, a closer
relationship is required with the National Economic Development Authority,
particularly at the regional and provincial planning levels, to ensure not
only coordination with national objectives but also to ensure that, once DBP
has determined its role in terms of these objectives, it can be assured of
adequate support through corresponding budgetary provisions of the Ninistries
of Agriculture and Natural Resources (extension staff and general resource
allocation). Details of future Interagency coordination are in paras. 5.06,
5.08 and 5.09.
3.16      The contacts between DBP's branch managers and the regional/
provincial staff of BAI and BFAR have not always been effective in the past,
mainly because of lack of definition of the duties and responsibilities of
the parties concerned (para. 5.06).
Implementation Experience
3.17      Operational.  DBP operates on the basis of set policies, backed by
manuals and established procedures. Substantial progress has been made over
the last few years in refining all operational elements such as relating
subproject cash flow estimates to an appropriate repayment period, ensuring
that scheduled repayments coincide with harvest realizations, time taken in
subloan processing. However, progress has not been uniform due to
difficulties arising out of the geographical spread of the branches and
staffing problems with postings of semi senior staff to the more remote
branches (para. 3.08).



- 26 -
3.18      Technical.  The continuing emphasis of all preceding projects has
been on the need to improve DBP's technical capabilities. Many measures
have been taken by DBP to improve the quality of its technical work and
substantial improvements have occurred due to training courses, development
of evaluation criteria, rationalization of appraisal and supervision
procedures. Greater emphasis is still needed, however, on collection and
dissemination to branches of current regional prices and costs to ensure
that judgments of subproject viability are based on up-to-date facts.
3.19      Target Group.  In the second livestock and fisheries projects DBP
agreed to direct a part of its lending towards smaller scale projects. This
reflected the appraisal assumption that this approach would enable borrowers
of the lower income groups to participate. However, supervision has shown
that, while DBP has been successful in lending for smaller scale projects,
many of the borrowers were from the middle income group. A detailed review
of this situation indicates that DBP is not an appropriate institution through
which to reach low income target groups, and hence poverty alleviation will
not be an explicit objective of the project.
3.20      Small Livestock.  The project participants have enjoyed generally
good results due to continuing undersupply of pork, chicken and eggs. Their
financial rates of return were seldom below 20%. As a consequence, subloan
demand was strong and exceeded appraisal estimates. However, over the last
12 to 18 months the rising cost of inputs has resulted in lower profit
margins in a more competitive market place (para. 1.17).
3.21      Cattle lending.  During the first and second livestock projects,
loans for beef development moved at a much slower pace, generally because
of the long gestation period of investments, difficulties in acquiring large
tracts of land, land tenure problems, remoteness of areas suitable for
cattle development, scarcity of feeder steers, and inadequate understanding
by potential borrowers that coconut and beef can be complementary
undertakings.
3.22      These constraints remain.  Of these the most intractable one is
the slow release of pasture land leases of Government land by MNR. While
Government is fully aware of this constraint and has made many efforts to
resolve it, progress has been minimal because of the political conse-
quencies inherent in moving the present illegal occupants of the land. In
additon there are unresolved issues such as lack of precise survey data,
questions of ecology and social balance etc. The Government continues,
however, to regard cattle development as an important objective. Given the
various constraints, the promotion of young stock production on existing
leasehold and privately held land (Masbate and Northern Mindanao) and
stimulation of its transfer to the villages has been continuing on a
modest scale.



- 27 -
3.23      Marine fisheries.  The depression of the fisheries industry due to
severe cost escalations after the 1973 oil crisis and expectations of a con-
tinuing upward fuel cost spiral have brought about a shift in preference to
smaller, more efficient vessels in terms of capacity utilization and the
risk of locating sufficient volume of catch from day to day.  Newer fishing
techniques aim at achieving economies of scale in fleet management and
increased emphasis on the more profitable export tuna fishing. The proposed
project would support these developments and also promote the adaptation of
the latest technical developments to Philippine conditions.
3.24       Inland fisheries.  This subsector has also shown large cost
escalations not compensated by a commensurate rise in fish prices. The
reduced profit margins underline the importance of yield improvements from
existing facilities.  Due to a recent change in Government policy, conversion
of fishpond leases from one and ten years to a twenty-five year term will be
speeded up, and should result in a better investment climate which will
ensure the completion and rehabilitation of a large number of subprojects,
currently at widely differring stages of completion. The implication for
DBP of this development is that it should strengthen its cooperation with
the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and further develop its
appraisal and supervision techniques so as to determine better the viability
of additional investment against the narrowing profit margins.
4. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project would, over a period of three years, support the
Government's policy of increasing animal protein supply by providing
medium and long-term credit through DBP to the livestock and fisheries
subsectors and by strengthening the institutional capability for planning
and implementing this and similar future programs.
4.02       For the agricultural credit component DBP would have maximum
flexibility to apply project funds to subprojects of the type already
identified under the current Government strategy, or to new types of
subprojects which may be identified in future.
4.03      The project's institutional arrangements envisage a direct
linkage between Government agencies which have responsibility for strategy
formulation and DBP as the provider of medium- and long-term investment
funds. Project components are, therefore, included to strengthen each of
the participating agencies.
Project Framework
4.04       The project would build on experience accumulated over the last
eight years in the implementation of Phase I and II of the livestock and



- 28 -
fisheries projects. However, the project's design has been developed within
the context of several other developments. Of these, three are of particular
significance: (i) the second phase of the Agricultural Support Services
Project, now being appraised, will provide a broad support to the Ministry of
Agriculture with particular emphasis on extension and research, and related
infrastructure, with the livestock subsector as one of the principal
priorities; (ii) the National Fisheries Project, due for appraisal before the
end of CY 1980, will be concerned with the poorest group, the municipal
fisherman, and it will therefore be directly concerned with poverty
alleviation; and (iii) a report concerned with the problems and prospects of
specific target groups is currently under preparation. Its findings and
recommendations to directly assist these target groups will be discussed with
Government in due course. Thus the basic concept of the project presented in
this report is based on the immediate need to increase food supply, and the
project's noncredit components are limited to items of immediate significance
to this project and also to items whose early introduction would support other
planned activities.
Project Description
4.05      The components of the proposed project are:
(a) credit through DBP for (i) medium and small-scale production of
pigs, and other small livestock (paras. 4.07-4.09); (ii) expansion
of the national cattle herd through development of cattle breeding
on pasture land and the transfer of young stock to the villages for
fattening and breeding (paras.  4.10-4.12);  (iii) construction and
equipping of fishing vessels to supply both the domestic and export
markets (para 4.13); (iv) rehabilitation and expansion of inland
fishponds and establishment of fishpond estates (paras. 4.14 and
4.15) and (v) other subprojects in both subsectors to be identified
during the course of the project period (para. 4.16); and
(b) strengthening of participating institutions through financing the
following noncredit components; (i) sectoral development program
- cattle (paras. 4.18 and 4.19); (ii) other BAI programs (paras.
4.20 to 4.23); (iii) FIDC programs (paras. 4.24 and 4.25); and
(iv) technical assistance - DBP (paras. 4.26 to 4.29).
Detailed Features
A. Credit Components (US$89.0 million) /1
4.06      DBP's annual lending programs would be formulated and implemented on
a flexible basis to enable them to be fully responsive to variations in loan
/I Total project costs in this section are quoted against each subcomponent
in constant 1979 US dollars.



- 29 -
demand and Government's regional development priorities. The following
description of detailed features does not constitute an agreed or binding
lending program, but represents instead the appraisal mission's judgment of
likely subloan demand and DBP's administrative capacity, and is used
primarily to estimate the total loan size.
4.07      Small Livestock:  Piggeries.  The project would support a broad
range of small and medium enterprises but typical subborrowers would
currently be operating a small, probably a 5-sow unit, located near an urban
area. Subprojects would raise the sow level to about 20 head and introduce
improved management.
4.08      Egg Production.  Subborrowers would include existing operators with
up to 5,000 layers and some new enterprises ; a typical subproject would
increase flock size from about 400 to 1,600 layers.
4.09      Other Small Livestock.  Past DBP lending has included broilers,
ducks, goats, rabbits and quail. These and other livestock production units
could also be financed where subproject viability can be demonstrated.
4.10      Cattle:  Village Level Production.  BAI would identify villages
suitable for handling both the fattening and breeding of about 50 head of
stock. The subborrowers would be either (i) entrepreneurs owning the 50
head and operating the traditional cattle profit sharing scheme (Paiwi) with
50 villagers selected to care for one animal each, or (ii) each individual
villager, borrowing on his or her own account. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that lending for this subcomponent would be limited to
those villages selected by BAI.
4.11      Pasture Land Production.  Government grants pasture leases of
about 400 ha each, particularly in the hilly areas of Masbate and Mindanao
for extensive cattle development. The recent increase in demand for pasture
bred young stock at village level now warrants changing management practices
of these pastures. Subloans would support these changes through provision
of finance for breed stock purchases, infrastructure and pasture improvement
to intensify the production levels. If Government succeeds in its current
efforts to resolve problems limiting issues of additional pasture leases,
lending levels could be higher than in the previous projects. This
component is viewed as the beginning of a long-term program to build up the
national herd on these pastures so as to supply a steadily growing number of
young stock to support village level operations.
4.12      Other Cattle.  As in the past, lending for cattle on pastures in
the coconut groves and similar small-scale operations would be eligible for
assistance under this project.
4.13      Fisheries:  Marine Fisheries.  Subprojects are expected to finance
fishing vessels ranging from 12 GT to 150 GT with the majority expected in



- 30 -
vessels smaller than 30 GT.  In addition, the project would support large
traditional outrigger canoes (bancas), operated by municipal fishermen,
fishing for tuna for export markets. Other investments are expected in the
re-equipment of vessels and the establishment of a limited number of
stationary fishtraps.
4.14      Inland Fisheries.  Typical subprojects would improve milkfish
production technology levels in existing fishponds through rehabilitation and
expansion of pond dikes and water control structures, and also improve pond
management. Some lending is expected for shrimp culture, eels and tilapia
cage culture.
4.15      The project would also assst DBP lending for fishpond estates
subject to the following conditions, for which assurances were obtained at
negotiations:/l (a) DBP would consult with the Bank, to establish mutually
agreed evaluation and approval criteria and procedures including technical
parameters, financial guidelines and cost recovery principles; and (b)
require the prospective borrower to submit a detailed, engineering-based
feasibility study as part of the subloan application.
4.16      Other Lending.  Past DBP lending has included slaughterhouses,
slipways and iceplants. These subprojects and other new ventures, such as
commercial vaccine production, day-old chick production and other similar
ventures which would be in direct support of animal protein production would
be assisted if shown to be viable.
B. Noncredit Components (US$13.5 million)
4.17      The project also includes four categories of noncredit components
which are essential to the long-term development of the two subsectors and
their related institutions:
(a) sectoral development program, cattle;
(b) other BAI programs;
(c) FIDC programs; and
(d)  technical assistance to DBP
/1   As neither DBP nor Government have any past experience with such
subprojects, no feasibility studies were available for mission
appraisal. As each subloan is expected to be large (greater than
US$0.5 million), at least for the first few subloan applications, the
mission considers that Bank involvement in establishing subloan
appraisal methodology and evaluating results is necessary.



- 31 -
The noncredit components would either support programs which have already
been initiated on a modest scale and have proven to be effective (cattle
dispersal) or others on which a beginning has to be made as soon as possible
in order to deal with longstanding problems on constraints (nutrition
research, feed supply, seed propagation).  The bringing together of li_-
stock planning is considered essential to create the basis for coordilnated
programs. The rationale of including these components in the present
project, rather than the proposed agricutural support services project
is both their readiness for implementation and close links with the credit
program.
(a) Sectoral Development Program (Cattle).
4.18      Cattle Dispersal Program (US$7.6 million).  The project would
assist BAI's ongoing cattle dispersal program under which BAI acquires young
stock for distribution to selected villages in preparation for their future
participation in credit schemes similar to the one outlined in para. .4.10
above. BAI is planning to purchase with Government funds about 20,000
heifers over the project's three-year period of which the Bank would partly
finance up to 8,000 head. In addition, vehicles and facilities for field
staff involved in this program would be financed out of Bank funds, with
Government counterpart contributions for local costs. Total Bank funds
would be US$1.4 million. Repayment for cattle would be through return to
BAI of the first progeny which would be used to expand the program.
4.19      Breed Stock Upgrading (US$0.3 million).  Project funds would be
used for the foreign exchange component (97%) of the import of approximately
55 purebred stock to upgrade the existing herd on BAI's Nlilagros stock farm.
BAI plans to include crosses between local stock and purebred in its cattle
dispersal program (para. 4.18) to gradually improve stock quality at the
village level.
(b) Other BAI Programs
4.20      Small Livestock Nutrition Research (US$0.8 million).  The project
would provide funds for a program under which BAI will conduct research
on the improvement of feeding regimes for small-scale commercial and
backyard (noncommercial) piggeries and poultry, utilizing locally available
low cost nutrients and mount an extension program to promote the regime.
Given the current financial and economic conditions of this subsector (para
6.11-6.13, 7.03), and the balance of payments situation generally, this
research now assumes high priority.
4.21      Pasture and Legume Seed Propagation (US$0.8 million).  The project
would finance the foreign exchange cost for the importation of a selected
range of pasture and legume seeds; BAI will utilize existing facilities on
their stock farms to propagate these seeds for distribution.



- 32 -
4.22      Cattle Markets (US$1.4 million).  The project would provide the
foreign exchange cost estimated at US$0.65 million for 50 weighing scales to
be installed in BAI's cattle markets, currently being constructed throughout
the country. This ongoing program is facilitating the commercial transfer of
young stock from hill to village level production, and between villages.
Further, small livestock (pigs, ducks, goats, etc.) are now also appearing in
these markets.
4.23      BAI:  Livestock Planning and Other Studies (US$0.15 million).  The
project would fund the cost of technical assistance to the Ministry of
Agriculture to review all matters relating to livestock policies and
planning by the Ministry and other agencies and to assist with the
formulation of a long-term strategy for the livestock subsector and for
relevant investment programs. This would draw together planning activities
currently undertaken by various agencies and promote a coordinated
development of the subsector.
(c) FIDC Programs
4.24      Fishing Gear Technology and Other Studies (US$0.3 million).  The
project would fund technical assistance to FIDC to develop an extension
package on the use of currently available deep sea fishing gear. The
long-term development of fishing gear suitable for local conditions requires
applied research on a specially constructed deep sea research vessel and
this technical assistance would develop the design specifications for such a
vessel and its research program. The project would also fund other studies
related to the subsector.
4.25      Review of Marine Regulations (US$0.15 million).  Funds would be
provided to FIDC for the cost of technical assistance to review current
regulatory practices and draft any necessary amendments with a view to
instituting effective control over access to coastal waters according to the
type and size of fishing vessel and gear used.
(d) Technical Assistance - DBP
4.26      DBP:  Provincial Feed Mills (US$0.05 million).  The project would
provide funds for technical assistance to DBP for the promotion of feed mill
construction and operation in rural areas in order to support more efficient
poultry production and to avoid current dependence on the feed milling
industry centralized around Manila and Cebu. Funds for the rural feed mills
are currently available under the Second Grain Processing Project (IBRD Loan
1269-PH).
4.27      DBP:  Long-Term Development Plan (US$0.6 million).  The project
would fund the costs of technical assistance (consultancy) to DBP as follows:



- 33 -
(a) development of a new management information system (US$0.45
million); and
(b) developmLaent of agriculture staff training programs and training
of in-house trainers (US$0.15 million).
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that agreed terms of reference, a
short list of consultants and appropriate recommendations for both consult-
ancies in terms of timing, estimated costs and other relevant details will
be submitted to the Bank in sufficient time for the appointments to be
made by December 31, 1980.
4.28      DBP:  Ionitoring and Evaluation (US$1.2 million).  The project
would provide funds for technical assistance to continue and expand the
ongoing monitoring and evaluation system initiated under the Bank financed
second livestock project. This exercise is being undertaken by DBP with
technical assistance from a Philippine consulting organization. To ensure
continuity of the ongoing project a sum of up to US$100,000 equivalent would
be provided by way of retroactive finance. This assistance will train
DBP staff to assume responsibility for M&E functions for all agriculture
lending, as well as providing the M&E analysis for lending activities financed
under this project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that a plan
will be presented to the Bank by December 31, 1980 for monitoring and eval-
uation of future agricultural projects, including their scope, geographical
coverage, time schedules, physical implementation plans, timing, cost
estimates, staff build-up, and future consultancy arrangements.
4.29      DBP:  Other studies.  Flexibility is desirable in the use of tech-
nical assistance funds as studies will have to be responsive to DBP's needs as
they emerge during the project. A portion of the total amount of $1.8 million
as allocated above (paras. 4.27 and 4.28) could be utilized for any other
studies subject to prior consultation with the Bank.
Implementation Schedule
4.30      Implementation of the credit components would be on the basis of
an annual lending program established by DBP in consultation with the
Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources, their relevant Bureaux,
NEDA and the Presidential Committee on Agricultural Credit. The annual
lending program would be reviewed by the Bank, and the agreed program would
form the basis for measuring implementation progress (para. 5.02). The
development of the lending program and the corresponding work plan, showing
the participating DBP departments and relevant government agencies, is at
Annex 3 Table 6.
4.31      Implementation of the noncredit components by the concerned
agencies would be based on a physical plan, time-table and budget, agreed
with the Bank prior to execution.

Cost Estimates
4.32      Table 4.1 has derived the credit component cost estimate from
past levels of subloan demand and DBP's administrative capacity and
consequently represents the approximate volume of DBP's livestock and
fisheries lending over a three-year period. The noncredit component is
based on estimates of specific activites. The total project cost inclusive
of physical and price contingency /1 is US$140.7 million; the credit
component is estimated at US$122.4 million and the noncredit component is
US$18.3 million.
/1 Estimates of expected price increases used to calculate the price
contingencies for 1980 through 1983 shown in Table 4.2 were: local
costs: 16%, 10%, 8%, 7%; foreign costs: 10.5%, 9%, 8% and 7%. (Base
year:  1979; local 22%, foreign 12%).

4.33      Consultants' Costs.
(i) The small livestock nutrition research would require three
consultants for a total of about 9 man-months, spread over tfhree years. The
total costs are estimated at US$100,000. The average man-month cost
including fees, international travel (3 round trips each consultant) and
subsistence is expected to be about US$11,100.
(ii) Livestock planning consultant's services would be required for
about 12 months at a total estimated cost of US$100,000 based on a monthly
average of US$8,300, covering consulting fees, international travel and
subsistence;
(iii) Fishing gear technology advisory services which would be provided
by one or two specialists in fishing boat deck design layout and operation,
and naval architect service for research vessel design are estimated to
require about 24 man-months at a total cost of about $200,000. The average
man-month cost (based on the individuals' fees, international travel and
subsistence) is expected to be about $8,300. The total estimated cost also
includes provision for local travel, local drafting and engineering services
and other minor items.
(iv) The advisory services to assist in a detailed review of marine
legislation would be provided by one specialist in fisheries' legislation
and fisheries' law, who would convene panels of representatives from the
Government, Universities and industry, to study existing patterns of
legislation and to make recommendations for a comprehensive revision of
existing laws affecting fishing boat operation. This was estimated to
require about 14 man-months at a total cost of US$150,000. The average
man-month cost, based on the individual's fees, international travel and
subsistence, is expected to be about US$10,000. The total estimated cost
includes provisions for the cost of local experts, local travel and local
clerical and printing services.
(v) For the development of DBP's new management information system the
services of three specialists have been envisaged: an expert in development
banking with accounting and auditing background, supported by an audit
specialist and a computer expert. A total of 24 man-months, spread over two
years is estimated at a total cost of US$300,000, based on a monthly average
man-month cost of US$11,500. This includes salaries of consultants, fees
and overheads, international travel and local subsistence. The man-month
cost is slightly higher than normal due to the three round trips/person for
international travel. The total cost includes provisions for local travel,
computer time, clerical assistance and general reimbursable expenses.
(vi) the consultancy for the development of DBP's staff training courses
will require an expert for about 12 months, estimated at an average cost of



- 37 -
US$8,000 per month. The estimate includes fees, international travel and
subsistence.  The total cost is estimated at US$100,000 and includes a
provision for local travel and other reimbursable expenses.
(vii) Monitoring and evaluation studies are estimated to require about
48 man-months at an average cost of US$7,500 per month to cover fees,
international travel and subsistence. The total cost is estimated at
US$398,400 and includes a provision for travel and general reimbursable
expenses. A provision of US$100,000 has been added to cover acquisition of
vehicles and motorcycles for field surveys, plus US$100,000 for retroactive
financing of the ongoing monitoring and evaluation study (para. 4.28).
Project Financing
4.34       The proposed loan of US$45.0 million would contribute 32% of
total project costs including about US$23.1 million of local costs. For the
credit component the Bank loan provides about 37% of total costs net of
subborrowers' contribution. Table 4.2 indicates the level of financing by
the Bank, Government, DBP and project beneficiaries.

Procurement
4.35 (a)  Credit Component.  In line with procedures established in the
previous livestock and fisheries projects, procurement of goods
and services would be on the basis of Government's procedures
satisfactory to the Bank, which require prudent shopping in most
cases and local advertising for some larger items. lbwever,
international competitive bidding (ICB) would be required for



- 38 -
fishing vessels constructed from material other than wood, and
any single item of equipment costing more than US$300,000, with
a total value between US$3.0 and US$5.0 million.
(b)  1,oncredit Components.  Funds under this heading are provided for
various programs to be undertaken by participating Government
entities including MOA, MNR, their technical Bureaux, FIDC and
DBP, which will directly support the lending program. Items to
be procured are few in number and diverse in nature and could not
be bulked to attract international bids. Procurement would be
on the basis of Government procurement regulations satisfactory
to the Bank except for two BAI items: cattle imports (about
US$150,000, para. 4.19) which would be by limited international
tendering, and legume seeds (about US$40,000, para. 4.21) which
would be procured on the basis of prudent international shopping.
The procedures provide for economic and efficient procurement.
(c) Consultants would be appointed on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank.
Disbursements
4.36 (a)  Credit components.  Disbursements would be made against certified
statements of expenditure at the average rate of 37%. Detailed
schedule is at Annex 3, Table 3.
(b) Noncredit components. For goods and services (para. 4.35 b)
eligibility for financing would be conditioned on establishment
of a detailed physical plan, equipment list, implementation
schedule and budget in consultation with the Bank and disburse-
ments would be made against normal documentation on the following
basis:
(i) equipment, vehicles and materials: (1) 100% of foreign
exchange cost; (2) 100% of the ex-factory cost of localy
manufactured items, and (3) 50% of the cost of locally
procured items;
(ii) cattle: (1) 100% of foreign expenditures for breeding
stock, and (2) 50% of the cost of cattle for the dispersal
program; and
(iii)  consulting services:  100% of contract costs.
Retroactive financing is recommended for consultants' services for DBP's
monitoring and evaluation studies in an amount of up to US$100,000 for
expenditures incurred after December 31, 1979.

Accounting and Reporting
4.38      Annual project accounts and project reporting applicable to the
previous projects will be redesigned in consultation with the Bank during
the first project year on the basis of the newly created management informa-
tion system. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
Internal Audit
4.39       The current system of internal audit will be reviewed to ensure
that the internal audit function reflects the introduction of the new
management information system. Assurances to that effect were obtained at
negotiations.
Lending Terms
4.40       Government would onlend US$41.3 million to DBP at the same rate of
interest it pays to IBRD and the same term, being 20 years including 5 years
of grace. DBP would onlend US$40.0 million (US$1.3 million is for tech-
nical assistance to DBP by way of consultancies) on the following terms:
for loans secured by land, 12% p.a. up to P 150,000; 14% p.a. up to P
3.0 million; 16% p.a. above P 3.0 million. For loans not secured by
land, the percentages are increased by 2% p.a. for the three loan size
categories./l   The onlending rates of interest would be periodically
reviewed by the Bank and DBP and an assurance to that effect was obtained
at negotiations. Over the period of execution of previous livestock and
/1 These rates reflect the December 1, 1979 increase of 2% p.a. authorized
by the MIonetary Board, as modified by DBP resolution NIo. 575 of
February 6, 1980.

fisheries projects DBP has refined its terms of lending to encourage the
smaller entrepreneur by graduating the subborrower's equity contribution in
relation to the size of his enterprise. The present system is acceptable
and this as well as other subloan terms and conditions would also be
periodically reviewed by the Bank and DBP.
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
5.01      Participating Agencies.  The Government of the Philippines would be
the borrower and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) would be the
executing agency for the credit component. Participating agencies for the
noncredit component would be the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), the
Fisheries Industries Development Council (FIDC) together with the Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) as well as DBP. In addition, the
following bodies would be involved in consultative activities, particularly
in matters relating to the determination of the project's credit financing
content: National Economic Development Authority (NEDA),/1 the Technical
Board for Agricultural Credit (TBAC) and Livestock Development Council (LDC).
5.02      Annual Lending Program.  The project's broad scope and the absence
of a prescribed lending program in terms of subproject categories requires
that DBP establish an annual lending program for the use of funds available
under this loan. The annual lending program would be established in consul-
tation with pertinent Government agencies and the Bank.  The present
interagency consultative, coordinating and monitoring mechanism is outlined
in para. 2.04. Although this has not been used in the past to establish a
detailed lending program, the structure does lend itself to the formulation
of broad lending parameters. However, regional priorities for commodity-
specific lending should be established through direct consultation with the
relevant ministries and regional development personnel in NEDA. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that DBP would present to the Bank for
comment before January 1 of each project year the annual lending program
established after consultations and agreement with NEDA, MOA, MNR and PCAC.
The initial lending program dealing with the balance of calendar 1980 would
be reviewed during negotiations and its receipt by the Bank in its final
form, reflecting DBP's consultations with NEDA, MOA, MNR and PCAC, would lay
the basis for the initial utilization of the credit component funds.
A1 The other "core" agency responsible for management of public investment
programs is the Budget Ministry, which collaborates with NEDA through
the Development Budget Coordination Committee. The Budget Ministry
prepares medium-term projections of total current and capital expendi-
tures. Thus for instance a program requiring intensified extension
service would need to be reflected in the Budget Ministry's estimates
of additional staff and other expenditures of the technical agencies.



- 41 -
5.03      Within DBP, responsibility for the establishment of the annual len-
ding program would fall on APPS in consultation with APD II, BAADs I and II,
the Corporate Planning Office (when established), utilizing sectoral
studies developed by APPS (para. 5.05). The introduction of the annual
lending program would be based on changes in the structure, functions and
relationships of these departments as explained below.
5.04      APD II and BAAD's Interaction.  APD II will carry the primary
responsibility for the assessment of the business climate, the development of
viable microeconomic models and provision of technical support to the
project. This will require increased cooperation between APD II management,
BAI and BFAR for both formulating the lending program and its implementation.
Similarly, as all loans would be made through the branch system, APD II's
relationship with BAAD I and II will assume greater significance. To achieve
this, the burden of administering all Metro Manila livestock and fisheries
lending and project reporting will be reassigned from ADP II to BAAD I and
the Financial Controller, respectively. This will also enable APD II to
concentrate on improving its technical support to the branch lending opera-
ations through development of new lending packages and assistance in promoting
such lending. To illustrate the basic elements involved in rationalizing
the APD II's structure, the APD II Organizational Chart annexed to this
report presents an outline of this formulation. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that these structural changes (including APPS, para. 5.05 below)
would be implemented by December 31, 1980.
5.05      Role of APPS.  The role of APPS is currently being strengthened
by DBP management. Long-term sectoral planning and the preparation of annual
lending programs is envisaged by the mission as a primary APPS function,
acting in concert with APD II and the BAADs. APPS would provide economic
expertise to support (a) APD II's development of technical designs for new
lending packages; and (b) the monitoring and evaluation of APD II's past
lending. The proposed introduction of a new management information system is
expected to relieve APPS from its routine project reporting function.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that additional, suitably qualified
staff with adequate experience would be engaged as and when needed.
5.06      Project Management and Implementation.  The Manager of APD II will
have the overall coordinating responsibility for the project while the Manager
in charge of BAAD I and II will be responsible for onlending the project funds
through the branches. This division of responsibilities is in line with the
concept that the technical departments are the overall project coordinators
and supervisors of the qualitative aspects of subproject evaluation, super-
vision and technical assistance in relation to specific projects, but that
the Branches and Agencies Departments are the implementors and supervisors
of the investment and repayment process. This dividing line will be



- 42 -
reflected in the project's reporting requirements.  Close cooperation of
DBP's Branch Managers with the regional/provincial offices of NEDA, MOA and
BFAR, and collection of local data by the branches on current prices, costs
and investment opportunities will be -very important. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that BAAD I and II will establish by June 30,
1981 a reporting system to communicate the findings and decisions reached at
regional/provincial development councils where DBP Branch Managers are
members and thus provide APPS and ADP II with up-to-date information and so
enable assessment of regional/provincial priorities. The roles in the
various DBP departments and counterpart government agencies are summarized
in Annex 3, Table 5.
5.07      Arrears Reduction.  The change in departmental functions (paras.
5.04 through 5.06) transfers the responsibility for debt collection to the
Branches and Agencies Departments which have already established a task force
for directing an intensified new approach to collections (paras. 2.13 and
3.13). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that DBP will present to
the Bank by December 31, 1980 a report on the results of the new arrears'
reduction plan as related to the livestock and fisheries subsectors, over
the preceding six month period, supported by statistics indicating
collections vs. collectables, penalty and other interest collected, age of
arrears, and properties foreclosed, acquired and disposed of. This is to be
accompanied by a plan for future actions.
5.08      Technical Assistance from BAI.  The cooperation between DPB, BAI
and BFAR (para. 3.15) has helped increase DBP's technical strength and should
be continued and intensified under the proposed project. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that by December 31, 1980, DBP would submit to the
Bank for comment two draft agreements, one outlining the objectives, scope
and working details of future collaboration between DBP and BAI, both at the
head office and branch level, and a similar one for DBP and BFAR. The draft
agreements would spell out such details as manpower to be made available by
BAI and BFAR, any specific terms and conditions, equipment to be provided
and by whom, locations to be serviced, performance evaluation system of
seconded staff, rules for reintegration of seconded staff by BAI and BFAR,
detailed list of duties of seconded staff and similar duty lists for DBP
field staff to ensure their complementarity at branch level. For cooperation
at head office level the draft agreements would set out rules for periodic
consultations, recording of decisions and review of actions relating to
project implementation, with particular reference to the establishment and
regular reviews of the annual lending program and general matters of policy.
5.09      Past experience indicates a need to further strengthen DBP
borrower-related assistance which should also include examination of input
supplies, the marketing situation, recommendations on management techniques
coupled with financial information and recording and reporting procedures.
In planning any training courses, a provision needs to be made for the BAI and



- 43 -
BFAR seconded staff to familiarize themselves with DBP's objectives, methods
and procedures to foster their more intensive participation and to broaden
their perspective in terms of financial and economic implications of technical
assistance to farmers.
5.10      Project Impact on DBP.  Three items relating to DBP's organization
and finances will be affected by the project. First and most important, the
project will lead to a reorganization of DBP's management information system
(para. 4.27); second, it will promote rationalization of departmental
responsibilities (para. 5.04); and third, it will affect DBP's cash flows
and financial results. The first two reflect needs which have developed
over the last few years. The third, that is the project's financial impact
on DBP, cannot be assessed by means of standard projections because the
financial flows depend on too many variables./I Consequently, the
programming of this extremely broad range of assumptions and their
cumulative effect would bring in an unacceptable degree of uncertainty to
produce a meaningful analytical exercise.
5.11      In previous years DBP undertook an annual analysis of operational
results under broad sectoral headings, such as agriculture, industry, real
estate, etc. The framework of these analyses focuses on the relationship
between the average loan funds invested and income, expenses, cost of funds
and the net income under these broad headings, and as such gives only a
broad brush presentation of sectoral results. In general, agriculture has
shown during the past few years a net loss equivalent to between 5% and 4%
in relation to the average portfolio, compared to industry and real estate
operations' net income of 4% and 3.5% respectively. These averages
naturally hide a wide variety of operational results of different
agricultural and other programs and clearly indicate the urgent need to
establish an information system able to create an analytical base to
determine the contribution (or lack of it) of specific agricultural projects
to DBP's cash flows and financial results.
5.12      Under these circumstances the appraisal mission considers it is
analytically more useful to highlight three specific facts: (a) judging by
past performance, DBP's direct and indirect (overhead) costs of project
implementation and administration are within the range of 4% to 5% of every
peso lent; (b) the blend of Bank and DBP funds will cost about 9.5% for
every peso lent; and (c) the interest rate of the mix of subprojects made
would therefore need to be about 14%, (which will very likely be the average
rate charged), for the project to break even. Thus the fine-tuning of
project reporting on the basis of a new management information system as
envisaged under this project assumes an additional major significance.

6. MiARKETS, PRICES AND ENTERPRISE INCOM4ES
Market Prospects & Prices
6.01      In 1978/79 supply and demand for the four major products of this
project were, on average, in balance, although over or undersupply was evident
at regional and provincial levels for certain products. The projected trends
for the future are indicated below.
6.02      Pigs and Poultry.  Demand is projected to rise annually at 5.0% and
4.6%, respectively, at current price levels. As costs in commercial
production depend on the input prices for feeds (yellow corn) and supplements
(soymeal, etc.), it is expected that real prices for pork and chicken and eggs
will increase with projected real increases in the international prices of
feed inputs. Therefore, the demand growth may be somewhat lower than these
projections, but not to the extent that levels of investment under this
project would be affected. As competition near the urban areas among
commercial producers is very strong, marginal producers may be forced to
withdraw from the sector. This is already happening in the Metro Manila area
and will continue. As large-scale production is expected to develop rapidly
in the other major urban centers, the role of smaller-scale commercial
producers remains important primarily in the more distant regions (from
Manila), and smaller provincial centers, currently undersupplied from
commercial sources, but with overall demand small enough to make these areas
unattractive to large-scale operators. Thus, the market and price prospects
would require DBP to be very selective in its lending activities in major
metropolitan areas (para. 6.12).
6.03      Beef and Milk.  Rising real urban income, especially in metro-
politan Manila, is strengthening demand for better quality meats, and
imported USA beef commands a very high premium. While the market does not
yet give a premium to local beef, this is more a problem of domestic
marketing and butcher practices.  The recent development of a large number
of cattle markets ("Oksyon" markets) is commercializing the transfer of
fattened cattle to the urban suppliers, and premiums for well fattened and
graded animals are now developing. This is primarily a result of BAI's
extension efforts to improve marketing. These improvements are likely to be
reflected in urban consumer buying patterns within the next two to three
years.
6.04      The national herd is too small to adequately supply current and
projected levels of demand for beef. Increasing domestic prices in real
terms will serve to encourage investment in cattle, but will also serve, in
the short-term, to encourage profit taking by turning off young stock for
slaughter, thereby slowing the growth of the national herd. If Government
were to adopt the strategy of large-scale imports to satisfy domestic



- 45 -
demand, this could act as a disincentive to the industry by dampending
prices; however, using imports as an effective control over price and
slaughter practices may prove a viable strategy. BAI programs for breedstock
improvement, an increase in the number of pasture lease agreements and the
demand for cattle for fattening at the villages will also assist in the herd
buildup. BAI's participation in the markets to purchase female young stock
for the cattle dispersal program (para. 4.18) would also serve both to
maintain price levels, and conserve the breeding numbers in the national
herd.
6.05      Demand for milk is very limited and up to now has been a high-
income urban consumer item. With the availability of milk at village level,
and the necessary nutrition extension, rural consumption will grow. As
saleable milk under this project is considered incidental to on-farm
production, the currently limited milk markets and the very limited fresh
milk distribution network are not considered limiting factors in this
project.
6.06      Fish.  Demand for fish, which is the largest contributor of animal
protein in the national diet, will continue to be strong. However, it is
expected that with rising incomes urban consumers will switch to higher
quality species, e.g. milkfish and tilapia (from inland fishponds) and
marine species such as mackerel and rose bream. In the rural areas any
increase in incomes will increase the level of fish consumption, (as meats
constitute luxury consumption among the rural poor); with expected improve-
ments in rural infrastructure and fish marketing the distribution of fresh
fish in the non-coastal rural areas is expected to improve. Government's
planned stimulation of municipal fisheries' production could be a major source
of supply to the rural marketing system.
6.07      Regional price differences are often large, reflecting the
localized regional supply situation. In the case of small quantities of fish
(characteristic of the majority of rural fish market centers) the costs of
moving any oversupply to another market are prohibitive. At this stage in
the subsector's development it is the regional marketing structure in
combination with trends in marketing that give some cause for concern. The
first trend is the move of some of the smaller commercial operators into
smaller vessels /1 whose smaller catch will increasingly be marketed in
local centers (in contrast with past patterns of the commercial sector
supplying predominantly the major urban centers). The second trend is
Government's current emphasis on increasing the productivity levels of
municipal fishermen, including upgrading of some to larger vessels (12GT
"baby trawlers" and large bancas, both supported under this project). At
the regional levels, therefore, the municipal and small commercial operators
will tend, over time, to be more and more in competition for the same
/1 12, 30, 50 GT vessels provided under this project.



- 46 -
local markets. As this project will provide funds through DBP for marine
vessels that would contribute only 1% of the total supply by 1985, the
project is not expected to contribute significantly to the potential
regional imbalances; however, as this type of project tends to lead the
industry,  _ increase in nonproject financed smaller vessels is also
expected, and together this could cause temporary imbalances until the
marketing infrastructure is improved. Government recognizes this and the
National Fisheries Project now under preparation would begin the necessary
improvement in regional fisheries' marketing infrastructure.
6.08      The wholesale price index for fish for domestic consumption indi-
cates that these prices have, on average, kept pace with inflation. However,
on a disaggregated basis, prices of low value marine species (the bulk of
municipal catch that does not reach urban markets) have declined in real
terms, and those of high value species have increased. While ex-vessel
prices for commercial catch have matched these trends, there is strong
evidence that urban price increases are not being reflected either at the
village level for municipal catch, or at the fishpond for milkfish, this
shows the entrenched position of middlemen who have been the main
beneficiaries of the increased prices. This is one more indication of the
weakness of the market chain, and its detrimental impact on the largest
number of producers, i.e, the municipal fishermen. Institutional arrange-
ments for dealing with this problem are included in the National Fisheries
project which is scheduled to be appraised in the near future.
6.09      For luxury species, e.g., squid, export species tuna and large
shrimp, the demand is very strong and growing. With the newly proclaimed
extended economic zone (Map 14745) the Philippines now claims exclusive
management rights to areas containing potentially large tuna resources, and
the private sector is well placed to take advantage of these opportunities as
demonstrated by the rapid growth in tuna exports since 1977. With domestic
marine resources close to the shore showing declining catch per unit of
effort of about 8% over the last 5 years, a transfer of capital infrastruc-
ture to tuna fishing is taking place. This now constitutes the major growth
area for large entrepreneurs in commercial fisheries.
Enterprise Models and Incomes
6.10      DBP will have the opportunity to finance a wide range of invest-
ments from the proceeds of this loan. This section presents a sample of
the expected range. Detailed analyses of the subloan models are contained
in Staff Working Papers.
6.11      Pigs and Poultry.  Demand for these types of loans was very strong
during the first two projects and is expected to remain firm in the fore-
seeable future.  Considerable structural changes have taken place, however,
particularly with respect to local concentration of commercial enterprises,



- 47 -
and some local market saturation has led to a reduction in profit margins,
which have also been affected by rising costs. The scale of operation has
an effect on profitability, with the larger operations being more attractive
in cases where all feeds have to be purchased from commercial sources and
even more so in those cases where the producer has his own feed mixing
facility. Smaller operations can produce very satisfactory returns,
particularly if locally available by-products can be included in the feeding
rations. Inclusion of local substitutes must be based on a proper dietary
balance of protein and energy components to achieve adequate biological
results. BAI has the necessary expertise for preparation of schedules on a
regional basis of balanced feed rations for dissemination by DBP to its
borrowers. Furthermore, DBP intends to intensify its involvement in
ensuring adequate feed supplies (and intervening as necessary) in the
regions where loans are made, and in stimulating initiatives for organizing
small producers for establishing their own feed mixing facility (para.
4.26).
6.12      Backyard piggeries are very popular because of their reliance on
household scraps and other inexpensive local materials for feed and a
relatively low labor demand. The majority of the pigs produced in this way
are for local consumption. To meet the growing commercial demand and
improve production efficiency and breeding quality, Government is also
promoting the establishment and expansion of larger enterprises. While
small farmers can undertake operations of up to 20-30 sows, larger-size
herds are generally owned by specialized operators with easy access to
inputs, finance and market outlets. Under the project, preference would be
given to upgrading backyard operations into intermediate size herds,
although larger enterprises of up to 100 sows would also be supported.
Careful screening by DBP would be necessary to exclude applicants in areas
with an insufficient feed base or where a growing cost-price squeeze is
jeopardizing the viability of the operation.
6.13      A farm model for the province of Nueva Ecija, which is considered
typical for the purpose of this project, indicates that an expansion of a
breeding/fattening operation from 5 sows to 20 sows would increase annual
farm income before debt service from P 7,000 to P 34,900 and provide a
financial rate of return of 21%. The cash surplus generated by the project,
including debt service, would be similar to the without-project situation in
the initial three project years, but will rise significantly thereafter.
Farm models constructed for other regions show considerable variability in
the rate of return above and below the Nueva Ecija model. Furthermore, all
pig farm models indicate great sensitivity to changes in costs and prices,
confirming the need for rigorous analysis and selectivity at the subloan
application stage.
6.14      In the poultry subsector, layer operations with 1,620 birds are
indicated to yield a financial rate of return of 28%, with annual net farm
income rising from P 15,900 to P 36,300.

6.15      Cattle:  Hill Production.  A typical 400 ha hill pasture with
about 25 breeding cows before borrowing, would yield a net annual income of
about P 35,000 p.a. without the project. Subproject investments,
including an increment of 25 breeding cows, pasture management and improved
animal health, will increase this to P 263,000 at full devJIopment, to
yield an incremental annual income of P 228,000. This yields a 21%
financial return on investment to the enterprise.
6.16      Cattle:  Village Level Production.  Transfer of young stock from
hill production to the villages results in an increase in efficiency of
food conversion, weight gain and calving. Under the Paiwi system,/I a total
net income on a unit of 50 cattle is equivalent to P 700,000 over the life
of the animals. This net income is shared equally between the Paiwi owner and
the cooperator villagers. The latter would receive the equivalent /2 of
P 7,000 each and would also take milk from the cows for family consumption
or sale; the milk has a value of P 7,000 and the cooperator thus receives
the equivalent of a total of P 14,000 over the life of the animal. The
financial rate of return to the scheme is 42%. Under the alternative system
of individual ownership, the financial rate of return to the owner is 52%,
with incremental income (including the value of home-consumed or sold milk)
of P 20,000 over the life of the animal.
6.17      Inland Fisheries.  Four levels of investment have been examined,
representing the expected types of loan demand:
(a) New pond construction, from mangrove swampland, to full technical
development;
(b)  Pond Reconstruction:
(i) Major: from a post-mangrove clearing stage, with
reconstruction of all dyking, pond leveling and new water
control systems, bringing the pond to full technical
development; and
(ii) Partial: an intermediate level, typical of investment
constrained by capital supply or borrowing capacity, with pond
leveling, partial dyke reconstruction, and intermediate water
control systems.
/1 Ownership of about 50 head by one person, with each animal being
cared for by a "cooperator", who receives every second progeny as
payment, or 50% of the profit after sale.
/2 In cash and as retained progeny.



- 49 -
(c) Pond Rehabilitation - to bring a "partial reconstruction" pond up
to the full technical development stage, to repair typhoon damage,
or to repair gradual deterioration of a fully developed, but
inadequately maintained, pond to its previous level of technical
development.
6.18      Pond productivity is primarily a function both of the level of tech-
nical development and of management. Due to the technical design of ponds,
construction costs on smaller ponds are higher on a per hectare basis, than
the same level of technical development for larger ponds, because smaller
ponds are not compensated by corresponding production economies of scale.
Smaller ponds will, therefore, give lower returns to investment unless they
enjoy other advantages. For instance, a combination of a chicken farm with a
fishpond secures a cheap source of. the essential chicken manure; similarly,
superior management or efficient marketing may offset some of the disadvan-
tages of a smaller size fishpond. The minimum economic size cannot, there-
fore, be established as an average national model.  On the other hand, it is
clear that a 15 hectare fishpond in any of the four development stages des-
cribed in paragraph 6.17 above will prove viable under normal circumstances.
6.19      Regional differences in pond civil works costs range widely, due
primarily to differential labor costs and the cost of site access; because
sites are coastal mangrove swamps, access to newly exploited areas is by
barge.  It is thus essential for DBP to treat each subproject on its own
merits to ensure that it is sufficiently viable to cover the corresponding
debt service.  In general, the rate of return must exceed the rate of subloan
interest by at least three percentage points for the subproject to be'
acceptable on financial and economic grounds.  Given the current high
construction costs, the narrow profit margins and the intention of augmenting
the productivity of existing ponds, the most likely utilization of project
funds will be for improvement through rehabilitation of existing viable
smaller and medium-sized ponds. In line with this reasoning the mission does
not expect DBP to utilize more than 10% of resources for ponds exceeding
40 ha. The following table illustrates cash returns and rates of return at
mid-1979 prices for a typical 15 hectare fishpond.

6.20      Marine Fisheries:  Returns to investment on fishing vessels are
dependent on the quantum of marine resources in the waters of operation, the
size of vessel and type of gear used, and distance of the fishing grounds from
the market. The wide variety of these conditions encountered in the
Philippines necessitates a wide range of vessel types and sizes. The models
used represent the mission's best judgment on achievable and sustainable catch
levels in the most appropriate fishing grounds for that type of vessel.
Experience has shown that, on average, the smaller the vessel the better its
chances to catch enough to fully utilize its capacity. The larger the vessel,
the greater the risk of not being able to achieve a catch commensurate with
its capacity. Due to continuing escalation of energy costs, larger vessels
have been affected more adversely than smaller boats and the latter are
beginning to demonstrate a clear advantage over the former in terms of unit
costs associated with a given quantum of fish capture. Past investment,
predominantly in large vessels, is thus no longer efficient in the
traditional nearshore waters because of declining catch. These vessels are
now shifting to more distant waters with a better catch potential, albeit at
higher operating costs. Thus, the bulk of future investment is expected to
be in smaller vessels for species aimed at the domestic market and in waters
close to fishing ports.

6.21      Other Fisheries:  Tilapia cages for use in inland rivers and
stationary fish traps for use in shallow coastal waters will yield over 100%
and 26% return and net annual incomes of El 10,000 and P 40,000,
respectively.
6.22       Environmental Impact.  No adverse impact on the environment is
expected. Effluent from large piggeries is typically placed in sewage
treatment lagoons. The small piggeries' waste materials are often used to
generate methane gas for household cooking. Alternatively, the waste is
used in food gardens and the rice fields. All droppings from poultry are
dried and utilized as fertilizer for vegetable production or in fishponds.
In the hill country manure from cattle aids pasture production, increasing
soil moisture retention. In the villages cattle droppings are used as
fertilizers for subsistence crop production. In the inland fisheries sub-
sector the project would also have a positive environmental impact. The
fish farmers generally have much to lose by pollution of the environment and
they constitute an important pressure group against pollution. For
ecological reasons the Government policy aims at preventing uncontrolled use
of coastal mangrove swamps for fishpond development. Very few leases have
been issued in recent years for fishponds in those areas. The major pro-
portion of the project's support for fishponds would be for reconstruction
and rehabilitation of existing ponds rather than for wholly new farm
development.

7. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Impact, Productivity and Employment Estimates
7.01      Formulation of the project to support the livestock and fisheries
subsectors on a broad scale entails flexibility in DBP's lending program.
Because of the uncertainty of the final mix of subprojects to be financed, a
prediction of the impact on the economy can only be based on an indicative
lending program. The composite economic rate of return calculated on this
tentative basis is approximately 28%. Subcomponents with extremely short
pay-back period (banca fishing, village cattle) were excluded from the
calculation to eliminate this bias. Also excluded were the noncredit
components. DBP's administrative expenses for the first nine project years
have been included as an economic cost. Utilizing the indicative numbers
that underlie the project cost table, an assessment of employment and
productivity impact have been calculated. These results should be
interpreted only as illustrative, and not as an indication of the final
outcome of this project.
Economic Returns
7.02      Tables in Annex 4 show the appropriate accounting ratios used to
convert financial prices to economic prices. All production from this
project (except beef and export marine species) were treated as nontradable
goods, and the standard conversion factor for the Philippines (0.82) was
applied. For beef a conversion factor of 0.86., based on the alternative of
imports, was used. The underlying assumption in deriving the conversion
factor for unskilled labor (0.48) was a marginal value product of labor of
n 7.00 per day. The derivation of conversion factors for export marine
species is shown in Staff Working Paper #1. The analysis confirms the
need for DBP to continue to apply stringent appraisal criteria and to
strengthen its analytical capability in the economic field (para. 5.05).
In the livestock subsector, availability of feed supplies at economic
cost is a crucial element and will have to be taken into account in the
formulation of DBP's lending policies. In the following section only the
overall results and policy implications for DBP's lending are indicated,
while Annex 4 contains the detailed tables of the economic analyses.
7.03      Pigs and Poultry.  Economic costs for these models include capital
and operating costs, but exclude working capital. The estimates of economic
benefits are based on sales revenues, and a residual herd value in year 15.
The economic rates of return are indicated to be 17% for piggeries and 20%
for layer operations. Due to the relatively large negative incremental net
benefits ,in the first project year and the high proportion of feed costs
in the cost structure, the models are highly sensitive to change in the
cost of feeds. To counter the economic risk inherent in these enterprises

it is necessary to substitute the less expensive locally produced feeds for
imported feeds to the maximum extent possible and raise productivity through
improved breeds and husbandry techniques. The project would support
existing Government efforts in this direction.
7.04      Cattle:  Hill Production.  The benefits to the economy of hill
production would arise from the improvement in management techniques, which in
turn improves animal nutrition, weight gain, productivity and reproductivity.
The economic rate of return on this component is 27%.
7.05      Cattle:  Village Level.  Economic returns to this component would
arise for the same reason as those for hill production, and under any of the
systems (i.e. Paiwi or village ownership), the economic return is greater
than 100%. This high economic return also reflects the virtually cost free
feeds (crop residues, village pastures) and family labor which has little
opportunity cost.
7.06      Inland Fisheries.  Economic benefits consist of the value of the
fish catch. Economic costs include the initial investment in construction
and all recurrent operating costs; a residual value of the investment
is accounted for at the end of the project period (year 15). The economic
evaluation of a 15 ha inland fishpond is given in the table below:

7.08      For wooden vessel construction, there is an additional, but
nonquantifiable benefit which would be of significance to the economy. Both
past fisheries projects have shown that the stimulation of the marine sector
has created employment for local traditional shipyards. These are essen-
tially beach operations, highly labor intensive and utilizing locally
available skills and materials. With the expected spread in the geographic
area to be covered by the marine component, the establishment of more of
these nonformal shipyards is envisaged. The results of the first and second
projects also indicate that this type of shipbuilding activity has continued,
even in the absence of DBP or Bank funding, and that additional vessels have
been built either on speculation or to order by these "shipyards". However,
vessel construction on the scale envisaged in the project cannot be undertaken
in the absence of equipment, material and labor contracting which would
require credit.
7.09      Sensitivity Analysis.  Although the economic models for the various
subprojects show a rate of return of not less than 17%, some of them are
particularly sensitive to changes in costs and prices. The subprojects
which are least sensitive to cost/price changes are bancas and hill cattle,
followed by minor rehabilitation of fishponds, and vessels of various sizes.
On the other hand, the two most vulnerable subprojects are piggeries and
poultry. In the case of piggeries, an increase in costs by 10% would reduce
the ERR to 2%, while an increase in prices by 10% would increase the ERR to
32%. The small-scale poultry model shows even greater sensitivity to cost
and price changes, thereby indicating the highly risky nature of smaller
ventures in this field (see also Annex 4, T-33).
Risks
7.10      The project's flexible approach to lending requires interaction
among various governmental agencies and DBP. While consultative channels
for such interaction do exist, they have not to date been used for the
establishment of an annual lending program, which is the cornerstone of this



- 57 -
project's flexibility in the choice of subprojects. Any lack of collabor-
ation among the agencies concerned would seriously affect the responsiveness
of the project to national objectives and the changing economic scene.
Related to this is the need to establish a "regional focus" on periodic data
collection and evaluation by DBP to ensure that the annual lending program
fully reflects regional needs and priorities. There is a risk that the
highly centralized process which has characterized past DBP lending programs
may militate against the regional focus.
7.11      Over the past year there has been a general narrowing of profit
margins, particularly of the smaller and medium-scale entrepreneur.
Continued efforts by the Government to hold the product prices to an arti-
ficially low level would erode profit margins and eliminate producers at the
lower income levels. This would have adverse social implications as well.
8. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      An assurance would be obtained from Government that:
(a)  DBP would make subloans on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, which would be reviewed periodically in consultation
among the Government, DBP and the Bank (para. 4.40); and
(b)  the present cooperative arrangement between DBP, BAI and BFAR
would continue and be intensified; that DBP would submit to the
Bank for comment two draft agreements before December 31, 1980,
one outlining the objectives, scope and working details of future
collaboration between DBP and BAI, both at the head office and
branch level, and a similar one for DBP and BFAR (para. 5.08).
8.02      Assurances would be obtained from DBP that:
(a)  lending for cattle in the cattle dispersal program would be
limited to villages selected by BAI (para. 4.10);
(b)  with regard to lending contemplated for fishpond estates, it
would initiate consultations with the Bank to establish mutually
agreed evaluation and approval criteria and procedures including
technical parameters, financial guidelines and cost recovery
principles; and require the prospective borrower to submit a
detailed engineering based on feasibility study as part of the
subloan application (para. 4.15);



- 58 -
(c)  it would submit to the Bank agreed terms of reference and a short
list of consultants for the development of a new management
information system and for the development of the agriculture
staff training program and training of in-house trainers,
supported by appropriate recommendations, outlining proposed
timing, estimated costs and other relevant details in sufficient
time for the appointments to be made by December 31, 1980
(para. 4.27);
(d) it would present to the Bank by December 31, 1980 a plan for the

Sensitivity Analysis
1.        A total of 14 models were tested for sensitivity to changes in
incremental cost and benefit streams. These included the piggery model, the
layer hen model, the hill cattle model, 4 inland fish farm models and 7
marine fisheries models. All data used in the analysis were economic values.
The models are listed below, with brief comments, in descending order of
internal rate of return (IRR).
2.        To judge the robustness of the IRRs obtained, assessment was made
of the percentage changes in the present values of benefits or of costs which
would bring the IRRs to 12% (the presumed opportunity cost of capital, or
switching value). The changes for each model were added up (taking absolute
value of benefit changes), and the IRRs were classified as shown below:
Sum of benefit/Cost Changes Li             Class
200                  Extremely robust
100-200                Very robust
75-100                Robust
50-75                 Intermediate
25-50                 Sensitive
5-25                 Very sensitive
0-5                  Extremely sensitive
The table at the end of this paper contains the precise figures for all
statistics mentioned below.
Banca fishing boat: This model shows positive net benefits even in Year 1
when costs are highest, so the IRR cannot be calculated. Under sensitivity
tests, the IRR is very robust, ranking 2nd of the 14 models. The model
ranks 9th in net present value (NPV) and 2nd in NPV/Cost ratio.
12 GT fishing boat: The IRR is 173.7%, and is very robust (5th of 14). The
model ranks 5th in NPV and 5th in NPV/Cost, but when compared with the other
5 fishing boat models, it is 1st in NPV/gross ton, 78% higher than the runner-
up (50 GT).
L1 Sum of (percentage change in benefits and percentage change in costs).

50 GT fishing boat: The IRR is 64.1%, ranking 4th in robustness. The model
is excellent in NPV (ranking 2nd, or 17% higher than the 75 GT model) and
NPV/Cost (ranking 4th).
15 ha fish farm - minor rehabilitation: The IRR is 53.4%, ranking 3rd in
robustness. Although the NPV ranks only 10th, costs also are quite low, so
that the model's NPV/Cost ratio ranks 3rd.
30 GT fishing boat: The IRR is 47.3% and is classed as robust (ranking 8th)
The model ranks 4th in NPV (only 10.6% higher than the NPV of the 12 GT boat
model) and 8th in NPV/Cost.
15 ha fish farm - new construction: The IRR is 43% and is very robust
(ranking 6th). The NPV is the highest of the fish farm models, and ranks 7th
overall, while the NPV/Cost ratio ranks 6th.
75 GT fishing boat: The IRR is 38.1%, but is of only intermediate robustness,
ranking 11th. High costs push the NPV/Cost ratio to 1lth place and account
for the NPV itself ranking 3rd, behind the 50 GT boat model.
150 GT fishing boat: The IRR is 35.6%, and is also of intermediate robust-
ness, ranking 10th. The size of the model puts its NPV in 1st place, but its
NPV/gross ton is the lowest of the 6 fishing boat models. Thus its NPV is
only 2.5% larger than that of the 50 GT. The NPV/Cost ratio ranks 10th,
less than 1% higher than that of the 75 GT boat.
15 ha fish farm - major construction: The IRR is 32.9%, and is very robust,
ranking 7th. The model ranks 7th in NPV/Cost ratio, just behind newly
constructed fish farms in both cases.
Fishtrap: The IRR is 29.7%, and is sensitive to changes in benefits and
costs, ranking 12th in robustness. It ranks 12th in NPV and 12th in
NPV/Cost ratio.
Cattle - Hill Production: The IRR is a modest 26.8%, but it is extremely
robust, ranking 1st. It is particularly insensitive to cost changes. This
model ranks 6th in NPV, but is so low in costs that the NPV/Costs ratio
ranks 1st (about twice that of the runner-up model, banca).
15 ha fish farm - partial reconstruction:   The IRR is 25.9%, and is robust,
ranking 9th. The NPV ranks 11th, and the NPV/Cost ratio ranks 9th.
Layers: The IRR is 19.6%, but it is extremely sensitive. The NPV ranks
last, and unfortunately so does the NPV/Cost ratio. The results of this
model confirm other Bank analyses which indicate that small-scale poultry
production is very risky. A relatively small change in market conditions or
production costs would threaten the life of the enterprise.

Piggery: The IRR is 17.1%, but it is very sensitive, ranking 13th (about
twice as robust as the layer model but only 14% as robust as the fishtrap
model in 12th place). The NPV/Cost ratio both rank 13th. Like the layer
model, this enterprise would tend to attract willing risk takers, skilled
costcutters and efficient marketers, because its IRR is very high under a
relatively small improvement to the cost or benefit conditions.
