RWANDA - TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Rwanda
Amount:            US$7.5 million equivalent
Terms:             Standard IDA terms
Project            (i)  Objectives:  To assist the Government in implementing
Description:           its Five-Year Development Program for the Telecom-
munications Sector, which aims at reducing Rwanda's
geographical isolation from other countries, improving
the internal telecommunication network, and extending
it to rural and urban areas presently unserved.
(ii)  Components:  The proposed project would provide for:
(a) expansion of the urban cable network in several
towns by about 1,300 main lines, and increase of the
number of subscriber's installations by about 3,000, in
Kigali and other towns ; (b) installation of a new
exchange at Rwamagana, equipped for 200 lines; replace-
ment of 10 existing exchanges, with added capacity
of about 2,000 lines; installation of call charging
equipment and adaptation of the installation at Kigali
and other exchanges for interface with the new inter-
urban exchange; (c) installation of an automatic trunk
exchange, equipped for 300 circuits; replacement of
existing ten HF and low capacity UHF links, and instal-
lation of microwave equipment for three new routes; (d)
expansion of the telex exchange at Kigali, provision of
teleprinters for about 100 additional telex subscribers,
and installation of voice frequency telegraph equipment
at about 12 centers; (e) construction of a warehouse
and other buildings; (f) purchase of vehicles, tools
and other miscellaneous equipment; and (g) technical
assistance.
(iii)  Benefits:  By improving the quality of existing tele-
communication services and extending them to areas of
country currently unserved, the project would improve
efficiency and stimulate economic activities in both
rural and urban areas, while also extending the benefits
of telephone facilities to broader segments of the
population.

(ii)
(iv) The project presents limited risks.  The main risk is
that physical implementation of some components might
be delayed. However, in telecommunications projects
with a relatively large number of independent activities,
delays in completion of a few works do not generally
prevent the use of other newly created assets.
Furthermore, when delays occur, the costs and benefits
are delayed in roughly the same proportion; hence,
the impact on the rate of return is not significant.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FOR A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
v  1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposr-d
credit to the Republic of Rwanda for the equivalent of US$7.5 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Telecommunications Project. The project
would be cofinanced on a parallel basis by Canada (US$4.0 million) and France
(US$3.9 million).
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report "Memorandum on the Economy of Rwanda" (No. 1108-RW) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on July 27, 1976. Economic missions
visited Rwanda in February and December 1979 and an updated economic report
is currently being prepared.
3.        Rwanda became independent in 1962.  Since the present Government
came to power in 1973, the country has enjoyed considerable political
stability. This has been partly facilitated by the unity and relative
homogeneity of the population and the absence of serious inequalities in
the distribution of income and wealth. With a per capita income (GDP)
around $150 in 1978, Rwanda is one of the poorest countries in the world.
It is one of the smallest but most densely populated countries in Africa,
with a population density of around 180 persons per square kilometer or
about ten times the average density for all of Sub-Saharan Africa. The
population remains predominantly rural, and only about 4.5 percent were
estimated to be in urban areas in 1978.
4.        About two thirds of Rwanda's surface area is suitable for agricul-
ture, virtually all of it already under cultivation. Small family farms of
about one hectare predominate with little use of hired labor. Roughly 95
percent of the cultivated area is devoted to foodcrop production with fairly
good diversification over a range of foodcrops (bananas, sorghum, peas, beans,
maize, cassava, and sweet potatoes). More than half of all farms also grow
coffee, the principal commercial and export crop, and many farms combine
crop production with cattle and small stock. Agriculture (including Forestry
and Fishing) accounts for about 45 percent of total value added.
1/   Part I of this report is identical to that in Report No. P-2818-RW on the
Integrated Forestry and Livestock Development Project, considered by the
Executive Directors on June 5, 1980.



5.        Apart from coffee, the only other significant agricultural export
crops are tea, pyrethrum, and quinine bark (cinchona). Coffee accounted for
about 60 percent of the value of merchandise exports in 1978, tea for around
7 percent, cinchona and pyrethrum each for roughly 3 percent. Significant
tea production and export only date from the mid-1970's and expansion has
been rapid.
6.        Cassiterite and wolfram, the principal mineral products, are still
important sources of export earnings (together accounting for about 20 percent
of merchandise export receipts in 1978) but production has stagnated over the
last decade due to resource depletion and rising production costs. Ongoing
mineral exploration has so far produced no significant new finds.
7.        The growth of output in manufacturing has been relatively rapid
over the past decade with gradual enlargement of the range of manufacturing
activities. In 1978 manufacturing accounted for about 18 percent of GDP
compared to around 14 percent in the early 1970's. Agro-industry and food
processing activities remain the most important.
8.        The landlocked position of the country and the great distance to
the nearest sea ports (1,700 km to Mombasa) create special problems. Apart
from the obvious effect of transport costs on import and export prices,
seriously exacerbated by recent rapid increases in the price of petroleum,
the country has been periodically subject to serious disruptions in trans-
port links from political events within and between neighboring countries.
Although the Government has demonstrated commendable resolve and effective-
ness in containing and correcting the direct and immediate effects of these
disruptions on the domestic economy the process of smooth and orderly develop-
ment has been made more difficult.
9.        Under the present government there has been a marked reorientation
in the focus of development strategy towards agriculture and the rural areas.
Increased food production is recognized as the cardinal priority and major
emphasis is also placed on improving infrastructure in transport and communi-
cations. These objectives are reflected in the current (1977-81) Five-Year
Plan and in the new Constitution which was adopted in December 1978. While
tangible progress has been achieved, the rapid population growth, general land
shortage, diminishing soil fertility and the country's landlocked position
impose serious constraints on the pace at which development can take place.
10.       While real GDP growth averaged between 5 and 6 percent between 1975
and 1979, progress was rather erratic and uneven. Poor weather conditions in
1977 and 1978 adversely affected agricultural output, particularly domestic
fooderop production which, over the past few years, has barely kept pace with
the rate of population growth. Production of coffee and tea, while affected
by the adverse weather conditions, has been stimulated by high world prices
since 1976. Information on developments in agriculture is still very frag-
mentary and incomplete but it would appear that such increases in foodcrop
or export crop output as have taken place in recent years have been due
mainly to extension in cultivation area--at the expense of animal pasture
and forestry uses--rather than any significant improvements in yields.



- 3 -
11.       The closing of the Uganda border during the first half of 1979
created serious supply and export problems. Domestic manufacturing and
construction activity were particularly affected as was the production and
export of tea. General shortages of imported raw materials and consumer
goods resulted in accelerated price increases - the general inflation rate
in 1979 is estimated at about 25 percent. However, the measures which the
Government took to allocate import supplies to priority uses and to limit
monetary and credit expansion did much to contain the adverse effects.
12.       The trade balance, which had been in surplus in 1976 (RF 760 million)
and 1977 (RF 2,105 million), registered a deficit of about RF 3,100 million
in 1978. This was mainly due to lower coffee export prices and to delays in
exporting the coffee crop at the end of 1978 with the closing of the Uganda
frontier. The deficit on services account has grown rapidly over recent
years with the effects of higher petroleum prices and transport difficulties
on transport costs. With significant exceptional external aid in 1978 to
meet the transport crisis the overall balance of payments remained healthy
and Rwanda's foreign exchange reserves in April 1979 were equivalent to about
7 months of merchandise imports. A factor which has also contributed to the
satisfactory external financial position has been that imports have been kept
at a lower level than would be required for more rapid and substantial eco-
nomic growth. However, the balance of payments position remains very sensi-
tive to world coffee and tea prices and, with the prospect of significantly
lower coffee prices over the next year or two, is likely to deteriorate.
13.       The government has pursued sound and disciplined budgetary policies
over the last few years with surpluses on current account being recorded in
1977, 1978 and 1979. The revenue base, however, remains narrow with a strong
dependence on coffee export receipts. Budgetary development expenditures,
while increasing, remain at an inadequate level and there are continuing
difficulties in significantly increasing development expenditures in the
agricultural and rural sector. Considerable strengthening in project
preparation and implementation capability is still required.
14.       Economic and financial developments over recent years illustrate
the country's vulnerability to external economic factors as well as con-
tinuing structural weaknesses in the base of the domestic development effort.
The priorities which the government has established for its development stra-
tegy, the initiatives which it has taken in fostering cooperation with neigh-
boring countries and its generally sound and responsive management of the
economy are encouraging signs. More adequate progress in agricultural
development requires intensified efforts in infrastructure (e.g., local roads,
storage facilities) and extension services. A better coordination of
external aid and technical assistnce would also be required. Recent efforts
to bolster project identification and appraisal capacity need to be expanded
and intensified. A more systematic effort is needed to monitor Plan imple-
mentation and, particularly, to better coordinate the annual budget develop-
ment expenditures with the Plan's investment program. The recent reorganiza-
tion of the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Commerce, which aims at more
effective coordination of policies, is evidence of the government's awareness
of these problems.



- 4 -
15.       Even with continued improvement in economic performance over the
next few years the need for external assistance will increase, particularly
with the prospect of deteriorating terms of trade. Rwanda's external
debt is low and debt service payments represent only about 1.5 percent of
export earnings. Given the country's level of poverty, the prospective
world trade situation and the length of time which structural adjustments
in the economy are likely to take, external assistance should continue to
be on the most concessional terms possible.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN RWANDA
16.       Bank Group assistance started in 1970 and initially focused on
the improvement of the road network and the strengthening of agricultural
production. Rwanda has received eleven IDA credits totaling US$88.5 million,
of which four (totaling US$43.1 million) were for roads, four (US$28.3 mil-
lion) for agriculture, two (US$9.2 million) for DFC projects and one (US$7.9
for education. There have been no Bank loans. An IFC loan of US$535,000
for a tea factory was signed in 1976; a second IFC loan of US$226,000 and
contingent equity commitments of up to US$60,000 for a tea factory were
approved in June 1979. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits,
IFC investments and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       The first three highway projects are completed and totally disbursed.
A fourth credit for a highway maintenance project (Credit 769-RW) was approved
by the Board in February 1978 and became effective in August 1978; the special-
ists financed under the technical assistance program are performing satisfac-
torily and procurement of equipment is in progress.
18.       The first agricultural development (Mutara) project was completed
in July 1979 and funds have now been completely disbursed. A second credit
of US$8.8 million, which supports the second phase of a long-term development
for the Mutara region, was declared effective on May 30, 1980, and implementa-
tion has started under financing from the Project Preparation Facility. The
Credit Agreement for a cinchona project (US$1.8 million) and the Credit
Agreement for the Bugesera/Gisaka/Migongo mixed farming and rural development
project (US$14.0 million) were signed in August 1976 and in March 1977,
respectively. Both projects are progressing satisfactorily. A credit for an
education project (US$7.9 million), consisting primarily of construction,
furniture and equipment for workshops, became effective in 1975. Physical
implementation has been slow and complicated by procurement problems. The
first credit of US$4.0 million to the Development Finance Company (BRD) has
now been fully committed. BRD's performance under the credit has been highly
satisfactory. A second credit of US$5.2 million to BRD was signed on July 13,
1979, and became effective on January 4, 1980. A project to support reforesta-
tion programs in Kigali, Butare and Gisenyi Prefectures (IDA Credit of US$21.0
million) was approved on June 5, 1980.



19.       Mainly because of shortage of trained manpower and managerial skills
in Rwanda, the execution of projects requires substantial assistance from Bank
Group staff through extensive supervision and from expatriate experts, for whom
financing is included in most credits.
20.       For the future, the primary emphasis of Bank operations will remain
on agriculture, although absorptive capacity and the activities of other
donors may limit the scope of our activity in this sector; on communications
to reduce the country's isolation; and on development of human resources.
Preparation of a coffee development project has been substantially completed
and pre-appraisal is under way. In highways, the Government has asked the
Bank to participate in the financing of the Butare-Cyangugu road, for which
a feasibility study and detailed engineering will be carried out this year;
the project would open up the southern region towards Zaire and Burundi and
support both the forestry and the coffee development projects. In the water
supply sector a project is being prepared which aims at improving water supply
in rural areas and providing sanitation facilities for Kigali. We also intend
to continue our support to the development bank (BRD).
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
21.       Due to insufficient past investments in the sector, basic telecom-
munications facilities are lacking in many parts of the country, and, where
available, they are inadequate and unreliable. With telecommunications
services increasingly becoming the least-cost means of communication for a
growing proportion of the population, lack of adequate telecommunications
services hinders business and commerce, social services, government adminis-
tration, and economic development.
22.       The Ministry of Posts and Communications (MINPOSCO) is responsible
for the regulation of telecommunications services within the country, allo-
cates radio frequencies for all services, and licenses private radio installa-
tions. Within the Ministry, the General Directorate of Telecommunications
(DGT), is responsible for management of the services.
Access to Services
23.       With an estimated 0.056 telephone subscriber per hundred population
(or about 1 telephone per 2,000 people), Rwanda has one of the lowest tele-
phone densities in the world. At the end of 1978, of the 2,721 subscribers,
about 70 percent were in the capital city, Kigali, with the remainder being
distributed among other smaller towns and rural areas. Registered waiting
applicants are mainly in Kigali and waiting times are long. Given inadequate
access to the public telephone system, there are approximately 50 licensed
HF networks serving primarily private industrial and commercial concerns,
and religious missions--which generally provide school and/or health services.
It is not known how many unlicensed radio systems (HF or VHF) exist.



-6-
Telephone Services and Usage
24.       At present about 50 percent of subscribers are private and 50
percent public. The smaller towns have a higher percentage of public
subscribers. There is no differentiation between business and residential
services, as residential telephones are also used for business due to the
difficulty of getting connections in the business districts. In Kigali about
99 percent of traffic is local, 0.5 percent in interurban and 0.5 percent
international. In the regional centers interurban traffic is about 20 percent
and local traffic about 80 percent; there is at present no international
traffic.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
25.       Quality of service is poor.  During business hours there is high
call traffic congestion. Service to subscribers is frequently interrupted
by defaults on the lines. This is particularly common during the rainy season.
Interruptions in the interurban network may last weeks at a time.
26.       The local exchanges are automatic, all fairly recent (installed
since 1970), but of the step-by-step type, without registers. Recently
purchased equipment for an extension of Kigali exchange was severely damaged
during transport and only part of the 3,500 lines installed is being used.
Six of the provincial exchanges have defects and cannot be utilized to their
full capacity. One of the major problems is that the six exchanges do not
allow subscriber long distance dialing. The other exchanges work satisfac-
torily. The local network is presently saturated and in most areas no new
subscribers can be connected, although the exchanges themselves operate at
only slightly more than 50 percent capacity. The main problem is the poor
quality of the existing cables which are no longer waterproof, thus creating
short circuits on the subscriber lines when it rains.
Demand for Service
27.       No comprehensive study of the existing and potential subscriber
demand has been undertaken to date. Since 1975 the annual growth in number of
subscribers has averaged 6.5 percent per annum with each increase in supply
always being immediately absorbed. In late 1978 the Telecommunications
Department requested from other Ministries lists of priority sites requiring
telephone services. The following responses were obtained: Ministry of
Education: 95 schools; Ministry of Youth and Sports: 13 youth training
centers; Ministry of Interior: links with all major centers, missions,
schools, hospitals, clinics, commercial centers, mining and industrial centers;
Ministry of Agriculture: all rural projects, tea factories, coffee plantations,
cooperatives and other development projects. Although these responses do not
provide precisely quantified estimations, they confirm that there is a large
unsatisfied demand in Rwanda for the most essential telecommunications services.
In the absence of a comprehensive study, telephone usage has been projected to
grow at 20 percent per year over the 1980-1984 period. Based on experience in
countries at comparable stage of development, this can be considered a conserva-
tive estimate.



- 7-
Sector Objectives and Constraints
28.       The goals established for telecommunications in the current five-
year plan include: (a) improvement in communications with the communes and
the main production centers and (b) completion of infrastructure to allow
direct communications with other African countries. The internal communica-
tion network should link all prefecture capitals with Kigali, the subprefec-
ture headquarters with regional centers and the communes with the prefecture
capitals.
29.       The 1980-84 investment program  for telecommunications comprises
the following components:
(a) ongoing works, which include:
(i) domestic network: expansion and rehabilitation of
the Kigali network, and establishment of rural call
offices;
(ii) international network: an earth satellite station
(cutover expected at the end of 1981), an inter-
national transit center for telephone and telex (cutover
expected at the beginning of 1982);
(b) the proposed project (see Part IV); and
(c) preliminary works for the future expansion of facilities
from 1985 onwards.
30.       This program is estimated to cost about RF 2.2 billion (US$24 mil-
lion), with a foreign exchange component of about RF 2.0 billion (US$21
million). The program is adequately designed to meet the most urgent needs
for improvement and expansion of telecommunications services, given the
anticipated resources and the technical and managerial capability of DGT.
IDA's Role in the Sector
31.        IDA first became associated with the telecommunications sector in
Rwanda through a sector mission in Mlarch 1979. Following this mission, IDA
assisted Rwanda by preparing terms of reference for consultants to design a
telecommunications master plan and to help prepare a project suitable for IDA
financing. Part of the cost of consultants was financed by IDA through the
Project Preparation Facility. IDA's strategy for the telecommunications
sector in Rwanda is primarily focused on institution building and technical
assistance, in particular through the provision of much needed independent
technical and economic advice.



-8
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
32.       The proposed project was appraised in November/December 1979.
Negotiations were held in Washington in iMay 12 to 16, 1980. The Government
delegation was led by Mr. Gatabazi Felicien, Minister of Posts and Communica-
!ions. A staff appraisal report entitled "Telecommunications Project" (No.
2873-RW, dated July 7, 1980) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. A credit and project summary is provided at the beginning of this
report and a supplementary project data sheet is in Annex III.
Project Objectives
33.       The project is a major component of the 1980-84 investment program
for telecommunications. It would permit to improve the quality of existing
telecommunications services, while extending the coverage to geographical
areas and segments of the population presently unserved. The proposed expan-
sion of the telex network is urgently needed as the present telex facilities
will be saturated during the program period. The expansion of the domestic
telephone network aims principally at bringing service to areas which are not,
or are insufficiently, served at present. These include a new development
zone at the outskirts of Kigali, provincial towns and rural centers which are
of primary importance for a more balanced socio-economic development of the
country.
Project Description
34.       The project would provide for:
(a) expansion of urban cable networks in several towns by about
1,300 main lines, and increase of the number of subscriber's
installations, by about 3,000, in Kigali and other centers;
(b) installation of a new exchange at Rwamagana, equipped for
200 lines; replacement of 10 existing exchanges with added
capacity of about 2,000 lines; installation of call charging
equipment and adaptation of the installation at Kigali
and other exchanges for interface with the new interurban
exchange;
(c) installation of an automatic interurban exchange, equipped for
300 circuits; replacement of ten HF and low capacity UHF links
with facilities of adequate reliability and capacity; installa-
tion of microwave equipment for three new routes;



- 9 -
(d) expansion of the telex exchange at Kigali and provision
of teleprinters for 100 additional telex subscribers and
installation of voice frequency telegraph equipment at
about 12 centers;
(e)  miscellaneous items (vehicles, tools, instruments, etc.);
(f) construction of a warehouse and of other project related
buildings; and
(g) technical assistance and training.
Project Costs and Financing
35.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$17.5 million equiva-
lent, net of any tax or import duty (MINPOSCO pays no import duties on tele-
communications equipment and is exempt from taxes). A physical contingency of
5% has been provided on foreign and local costs. Price contingencies have
been estimated for all equipment on the basis of an annual price escalation of
8% for foreign costs and 15% for local costs. Total price contingencies would
thus amount to about 21% of the estimated base cost plus physical contingency.
The proposed credit of US$7.5 million would be extended to the Government of
Rwanda on standard IDA terms and would finance about 43 percent of total
project costs. France, through Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), has agreed to finance the
equivalent of US$3.9 million (about 22 percent of project costs). The signing
of co-financing agreements with FAC and with CCCE would be conditions of
credit effectiveness (Section 6.01(a) and (b) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). Canada, through the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) has already signed an agreement to finance US$4.0 million (about
23 percent of project costs). The French and Canadian financing would be
provided on a parallel basis, and procurement of equipment would be on the
basis of competitive bidding, in France and Canada, respectively. The
Government would finance US$2.1 million equivalent (12 percent of project
costs).
Implementation
36.       Responsibility for project implementation would rest with the
General Directorate of Telecommunications (DGT) of the Ministry of Posts and
Communications. The DGT would employ consultants to: (a) prepare the
specifications and bidding documents for the telephone switching equipment,
cable networks, microwave VHF/UHF radio equipment, open wire carrier systems
and rural network materials; and (b) provide assistance for the supervision
of installation and acceptance testing of telephone switching and microwave
systems. DGT would lay and join the cables and install the subscriber facili-
ties in the provincial towns; in the metropolitan area, it would be assisted
by the supplier(s). DGT would supervise the contractors who would supply and



- 10 -
install the telephone exchanges as well as microwave and VHF/UHF radio equip-
ment. To ensure that adequate facilities are available for safe storage of
equipment, the contract for construction of the proposed storage building
would be signed prior to equipment tendering (Section 3.07 of draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement). Civil works for construction of buildings and access
roads would be carried out by DGT.
Institutional Aspects
37.       As DGT is part of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, its
development plan, personnel, administrative and financial policies are re-
quired to conform to the directives of the Council of Ministers and the
regulations governing civil service in Rwanda. DGT's budget is part of the
government's budget, and its investment funds are controlled by the Ministry
of Planning. DGT is headed by a director general appointed by the Minister of
Posts and Communications, with three Departments reporting to the Director
General (Accounts, Technical and Planning, and Operations). While the estab-
lishment of a separate Office of Telecommunications is considered premature by
the Government, this organizational issue would be kept under review by the
Government, and periodically discussed with the Association.
Technical Assistance for Management and Control
38.       The management, budgeting and control systems of DGT need consider-
able strengthening. In particular, there is a need for a rational and simple
management information system to provide condensed and relevant information
to the Director and the Departmental Managers. To help DGT during this
critical phase of expansion, the proposed project would include about 90
staff-months of telecommunications experts and 10 staff-months of financial
experts to help design and implement new systems for the control of the
planning, programming, budgeting, maintenance and operations functions. The
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment of these
consultants would be satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.02 of draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Staff
39.       The total staff of DGT comprises 54 technical and administrative
staff; 66 technicians and specialized workers, and 320 operators, linesmen,
cable jointers, drivers and unskilled workers. In comparison with organizations
of similar size in other countries, the number of staff is high in terms of
the number of telephones in service (109 per 1,000 DELs), although small
networks do tend to have a high staff density. Throughout the project period,
DGT does not anticipate expanding its staff, and by the end of 1984 staff
density would be reduced to about 60 per 1,000 DELs, which is reasonable.



Training
40.       A training school has been recently opened by DGT in Kigali.
The training program is designed primarily for operators, linesmen, switching
technicians and cable jointers and incorporates both introductory courses
and refresher courses. Higher level staff is not trained in Rwanda, but is
sent to advanced schools in other African countries (Senegal and Madagascar).
The school of Kigali can accommodate about 50 students and has classroom
capacity to train each year at least 20 percent of the staff requiring
training. The limiting factors are the scarcity of adequate training equip-
ment and the difficulty of finding suitable teachers. In order to have
a fully operational training facility the project would finance three trainers
of various disciplines, each for a period of two years. As the school does
not provide training in accounting, it is also proposed that a one-month
course in accounting be held each year. The project would thus finance a
total of about 76 staff-months of teachers. Provision would also be made in
the project for training equipment and for senior members of DGT to attend
overseas management courses. The qualifications and terms and conditions of
employment of the teachers financed by the project would be submitted to IDA
for approval (Section 3.06 of draft Development Credit Agreement).
Tariffs
41.       Given the scarcity of resources available to the telecommunications
sector in Rwanda, tariffs are one means through which telecommunications ser-
vices can be allocated to high priority uses. However, this aspect of tariff
policy has not been, in the past, a prime factor in determining tariff levels
or structure. As a result, telephone installation and rental charges are
still relatively low in Kigali, while rentals in smaller exchange areas are
twice the rate charged in the capital city. Also, there are no differential
rates between daytime peak period calls and off peak nighttime and weekend
calls over the long distance network. Local call charges, however, are not
low by international standards and, at present, revenues received by DGT are
sufficient to generate a rate of return of at least 10% on revalued
fixed assets. In order to rationalize tariff levels and structure, DGT
would undertake a tariff review, to be completed by June 30, 1981, under
terms of reference acceptable to IDA and would thereafter discuss the find-
ings and recommendations of this study with the Association (Section 4.04 of
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Financial Performance
42.       The financial performance of DGT's telecommunications operations
in recent recent years has been satisfactory in terms of both financial return
and internal cash generation. On the whole, DGT's financial position is
sound and its capital structure is adequate. To ensure continued financial
viability of telecommunications operations, telecommunications tariffs would
be maintained at levels sufficient to achieve a rate of return of at least
10 percent on the current value of net fixed assets (Section 4.02 of draft
Development Credit Agreement).



- 12 -
43.       At present, outstanding receivables correspond to about 8 months
of traffic revenues, which is high. The Government has agreed that every six
months, DGT would prepare and forward to IDA an analysis of outstanding
receivable accounts by type of user and would institute procedures to ensure
that by December 31, 1982 the level of outstanding receivables would not
exceed an amount equivalent to one-third of the annual operating revenue of
DGT (Section 4.05 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Accounting
44.       In the past, the DGT did not maintain commercial accounts.  During
project preparation, memorandum commercial accounts for the years 1976
to 1979 were prepared. The Government has agreed that DGT would continue
to prepare separate commercial accounts and that these would be forwarded
to IDA within four months of the end of the financial year (Section 3.01
(b) of draft Development Credit Agreement). A financial consultant to be
provided under the technical assistance program (paragraph 38) would assist
DGT in the preparation of these accounts.
Audit
45.       The Ministry of Finance appoints from time to time special inves-
tigators from within the Ministry to examine the financial state of affairs
of the various ministries and their departments. There is no system of
annual independent audits of government departments. The accounts of public
corporations are audited but the shortage of qualified French-speaking
auditors in the region often causes difficulties and delays. The Government
has agreed that DGT's commercial accounts would be audited each year by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association and that these accounts
together with the auditors' report would be forwarded to the Association
within six months of the end of each fiscal year (Section 4.01(b) of draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
46.       All equipment to be financed by the proposed IDA credit would
be procured through international competitive bidding, except for some equip-
ment costing about US$0.5 million. The items excluded from ICB and proposed
for negotiated purchase on grounds of compatibility, savings on spare parts
and ease of maintenance would be: (a) additional interworking equipment to
be installed in the existing Kigali local exchange; and (b) additional equip-
ment to increase the capacity of the telex exchange. The price of these
items would be subject to IDA approval and would have to be reasonable in
comparison with ICB prices. Contracts for vehicles and sundry equipment
costing less than US$50,000 and not exceeding a total of US$500,000 would be
awarded on the basis of Government procurement procedures, which are satisfac-
tory.
Disbursements
47.       IDA funds would be disbursed as follows:  (a) 100 percent of foreign
expenditures on equipment for the local telephone network, the long distance net-
work and the telex network; (b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 80 percent



- 13 -
of local expenditures (excluding duties and taxes) on vehicles, training
equipment and civil works; and (c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90
percent of local expenditures for consultants' services. Disbursements
against all above categories would be fully documented.
Economic Justification, Project Benefits and Risks
48.       Lack of swift and reliable communications is becoming an increas-
ingly severe bottleneck for the development of the productive sectors. In
urban areas, replacement and expansion of telecommunications facilities is
needed to meet at least part of the unsatisfied demand, relieve congestion
and, at a minimum, prevent further deterioration in service quality. In
smaller towns, and in the more remote areas currently unserved, access to
telecommunications needs to be broadened and improved to better serve the
needs of the rural population.
49.       There are thus both efficiency and equity aspects of the project
benefits. Urban business, service industries and public administration
are highly dependent on telecommunications. Provision of additional lines
in urban areas and relief of congestion would improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of management and administration, both in the private and in the
public sector. Also, to the extent that telephone connection is a substitute
for face-to-face communications, it could reduce growth in vehicular traffic
and petroleum consumption. Similarly, in rural areas, automation and expan-
sion of local networks and automation of long distance service in some of the
areas currently unserved would promote the Government's goals of decentraliza-
tion, stimulate production and marketing activities, improve the access to
social services and reduce transport-related costs of projects. The additional
revenues generated by DGT from expanded and automated domestic services and
the international services would enable DGT to finance a significant portion
of its own capital expenditures.
50.       The project's financial rate of return is estimated at 12 percent
but this significantly understates the economic benefits from the investment
program because the benefit stream used in the calculation does not include
the consumer surplus to be received by the telephone users. By estimating
the consumer surplus on the basis of prices which the existing subscribers and
registered applicants have demonstrated a willingness to pay, the economic
rate of return is estimated at 18 percent.
51.       No adverse environmental or health effects are expected from the
project. The project presents limited risks. The main risk is that physical
implementation of some components might be delayed. However, in telecom-
munications projects comprising a large number of independent works, a delay
in the implementation of a few works does not generally prevent the use of
other newly created assets. Furthermore, when delays occur, the costs and
benefits are delayed in roughly the same propcrtion; hence, the impact on
the rate of return is not significant.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Rwanda and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement, are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III to this report.  Additional conditions of effectiveness of the
credit would be that co-financing agreements be signed with FAC and CCCE
(Section 6.01(a) and (b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

PROJECTS IN RWANDA 1/
Credit No. 567-RW      Education Project; US$8.0 Milion credit of June 30, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: December 1, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project includes the construction, furnishing and equipment
of 150 workshops for about 6,000 students and of a print shop, and the
provision of paper for production and distribution of text books written
in Kinyarwanda. The project also provides technical assistance to the school
financing and construction unit (SFCS), which was established under the
project. The design and construction standards of the workshops are simple
and solid, and the buildings are well-built. Construction of the office
building for the SFCS has been completed and construction of the print shop is
nearing completion. Following an in-depth review: (i) the number of workshops
to be financed under the credit were increased from 150 to about 250; (ii) an
amount of US$130,000 was cancelled because of misprocurement of certain
construction materials; and (iii) an amount of about US$1.75 million, improperly
disbursed, will be restituted to the project by the Government through a
temporary reduction of the agreed disbursement percentages. Because of
misprocurement of paper, IDA recently communicated to the Government its
decision to cancel $1.4 million from the project.
Credit No. 655-RW      Rwandese Development Bank Project; US$4.0 Million;
Credit of August 20, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: March 2, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This credit to the Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD) is
intended to help meet the foreign resources requirements of this institution
which provides long-term financing to the main productive sectors in Rwanda.
This project is proceeding satisfactorily, and the credit is now fully
committed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 656-RW          Cinchona Project; US$1.8 Million credit of August 20, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: March 2, 1977
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project, which is to be carried out over a period of five years,
will provide agricultural inputs, extension, marketing and other services to
smallholders to assist in the expansion of cinchona production for export.
Project staff has been appointed and an expatriate cinchona expert has been
hired to visit Rwanda from time to time to give advice on cinchona production.
The most serious difficulty concerns a fungal disease in seed beds, but this
is being solved. World market prices for derivates have been falling signi-
ficantly over the last year. It is envisaged that the price paid to farmers
for bark will be lowered and that bark will be locally processed to render
cinchona grown in Rwanda more competitive on the world market.
Credit 668-RW          Bugesera Gisaka/Migongo Mixed Farming and Rural
Development Project; US$14.0 Million credit of
March 31. 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: November 23, 1977;
Closing Date: September 30, 1982
The project consists of the promotion of mixed farming and rural
development in two regions and the strengthening of the central services
responsible for rural development. The project includes tse tse control,
field extension and infrastructure, provision of farm inputs on credit,
construction and improvement of feeder roads and water facilities, schools,
health centers, establishment of two cattle ranches and a study for an
irrigation project. The project is cofinanced with BADEA (US$5.0 million
equivalent for livestock development), Belgium (US$0.9 million equivalent
for water facilities) and France. The Ministry of French cooperation is
providing seven of the nine experts required by the Project. Satisfactory
progress has been made with start-up activities, including programming of
work, budgeting, procurement and construction. Arrangements for the prepara-
tion of a second phase project are underway.
Credit 769-RW          Fourth Highway Project; US$15.0 Million credit
of April 1978;
Date of Effectiveness: August 4, 1978;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
Implementation of the Fourth Highway Project (a US$15.0 million
credit for road maintenance) started in January 1978. Specialists financed
under the technical assistance program are in the field and are performing
satisfactorily.  Procurement of equipment is in progress.  On the suggestion
of the Association, an expert on labor intensive methods visited Rwanda
for three weeks in June 1978 and recommended that one mechanized unit be
replaced by one unit utilizing labor intensive methods. Following the con-
sultant's recommendation, the Government decided to introduce labor-intensive
methods for road maintenance.

Clositg Date: June 30, 1983
The Project aims at providing further assistance to the industrial
sector by supporting the activities of the Rwandese Development Bank. It
includes two components: (a) a second line of credit of US5.0 million which
would finance 67 percent of BRD's foreign exchange requirements in 1979 and
1980; and (b) a feasibility study for the establishment of an auditing firm
in Rwanda (US$0.2 million). The Credit Agreement became effective on January
1980.

US$8.75 Million credit of July 13, 1979;
Date of Effectiveness: May 30, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project is the second phase of a long-term development program
for the Mutara region. It aims at developing techniques, procedures, and an
institutional environment which will make it possible to preserve the
production potential of the area, make a rational and more intensive use of
available resources, improve farming and ranching techniques, and integrate
the project into the local administration. The credit was declared effective
May 30, 1980, but project implementation was initiated earlier under financing
by the Project Preparation Facility.
