PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
1.       This report covers the first Telecommunications Project in Rwanda,
supported by Credit 1057-RW. The credit for $7.5 million to the Republic
of Rwanda was approved in July 1980, became effective in July 1981, and was
closed in June 1987, two years after the original closing date.
2.       This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared in the Technical
Department (Africa) of the World Bank on the basis of information available
in the files and of information supplied by the Borrower's Directorate
General of Telecommunications (DGT).
3.       The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and the cofinancing agencies
for comments but none were received.

CaED'T 1057-RW
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.       The Government of the Republic of Rwand& requested Bank's
assistance in financing an accelerated development in the
telecommunications sector. The request led to the First Telecommunications
Project. It supported the 1980-84 sector expansion program, which was
commenced at the end of the Second National Five Year Plan (1977-81) and
completed within the Third Plan (1982-86).
2.       The Government's development objectives for the sector were to:
increase the efficiency of the Telecommunications systems, their operation
and management; improve and expand the services in Kigali and over the
total area of the country, in order to support the efforts made under the
successive development plans in breaking the isolation of rural areas and
involving them in the overall economic and social development process; and
expand international communications to facilitate trade and coordinate
transportation. Additional financing was provided by several bilateral
agencies and the UNDP.
3.       The Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT), a department
of the Ministry of Posts and Communications through 1983 and of the
Ministry of Transports and Communications since 1984, was responsible for
the w!;ole telecommunications sector (domestic and international services)
during the project period.
4.       The sector benefitted from the project in terus of service
improvement and expansion, although the project's initial schedule was too
optimistic. Implementation was completed about three years later than
originally scheduled. During the extended project period, and
simultaneously, a larger expansion than initially planned was realized.
Thin resulted in more integrated modernization of the facilities and of the
services provided. On the other hand, virtually no institutional
development occurred, although the project helped the DGT in introducing
memorandum commercial accounts in its operation and the Government to
recognize the weaknesses of the sector's institutions.
5.       The main findings and lessons to be learned are:
(a) In preparation of the project schedule, greater account should
have been taken of the lead time required to conclude external co-
financing arrangements for major project components. Similarly,
more attention should have been given to the bureaucratic
constraints which were prevailing in the administrative set-up of
DGT's activities.



- viii -
b) During pioject preparation, a more realistic assessment of
telephone and telex demand should have been made, as both
forecasts were underestimated.
(c) IDA ehould have put greater emphasis upon the Borrower's
compliance with the accounting and external auditing requirements,
as well as upon more seriously considering the significance and
outcome of the tariff study.
(d) IDA should have supervised more closely the general financial
status of the DGT during and at the outcome of the project.
(e) DCT benefitted of extended outside technical assistance under its
program, from the project and from other donors. Some of this
assistance was redundant. IDA could have suggested that more
efficient coordination be exercised in this field by DGT and MTC.
6.       Government has requested IDA's assistance for a second project.
Shortly after project completion, and as a result of project
implementation, and, more generally, of IDA's insistence on public sector
restructuring in Rwanda, Government has decided to set up two separate
autonomous entitities for Posts and Telecommunications, to be operated on a
fully commercial basis. In this context, there is a strong rationale for
continued IDA involvement in the sector. The experience g&ined through the
first project should be fully used by IDA and the Borrower when preparing
and implementing the proposed aecond project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The public telecommunications services of Rwanda are curtently
provided by the Ministry of Transports and Communications (MTC), through
its Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT).1 MTC ensures the
regulatory, administrative, budgetary and regulatory functions for these
services and is responsible for licensing of private radio installations
within the country. DGT is in charge of the management, development and
operation of all services, including domestic and international
telecomm.unications, and is headed by a Director General. IDA Credit
1057-RW for $7.5 million was the first credit to the telecommunications
sector in Rwanda.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01     The Bank was approached by the Government of Rwanda in late 1978
to finance the development of the telecommunications sector. Increased
priority was being given to telecommunications within the framework of the
ongoing second national five-year plan (1977-81) in light of the growing
urgency to overcome the enclave problem, to raise the rate of in-estment
and growth, to foster decentralization, and to encourage rural development.
A Bank sector mission visited Rwanda in March 1979 and recognized the need
to aesist Government in its efforts to improve and expand domestic and
international telecommunications services. The sector study2 emphasized
four major issues to be addressed:
(a) inadequate access to, and poor quality of internal
connections;
(b) serious deficiencies in international connections;
1/ Until the end of 1983, the Ministry of Posts and Communications (MPC)
was responsible for the postal and telecommunications services. The
transfer to MTC did not change the organization and administration of the
services.
2/ Telecommunications Sector Memorandum, No. 2547 of 05/04/79.



(c) poor managerial and unsatisfactory financial situation
of the services; and
(d) poor operation, maintenance, and investment planning.
It was considered that the Bank could play a crucial role in assisting the
Government in developing the sector and overcoming constraints. A
potential project was identified to finance part of the increased
telecommunications expansion program, together with technical assistance
for reorganization, management and training activities.
2.02     The project was further defined by preparatory exchange of
information and discussions among the Government, bilateral donors and the
Bank. In September 1979, a Bank project preparation mission outlined with
DGT an updated 1980-84 investment program for telecommunications.
Meanwhile Canada and France had expressed interest in financing parts of
telecommunications development in Rwanda, for long distance radio and
switching facilities, respectively. Agreements were also being finalized
with Japan to finance international facilities, and with Netherlands to
improve local networks. Because of the need for reliable accounts and more
information on DGT's investment program and its implementation schedule, an
updated program as well as the design and timetable of a suitable project
for IDA financing were prepared by Government and DGT with assistance of
consultants financed from IDA's Project Preparation Facility (PPF
No. P085 RW). Two consultants, one in engineering and one in financial
management started work in October 1979. The revision of the 1980-84
program and the preparation of the project were completed in December 1979.
2.03     The December 1979 appraisal mission reviewed DGT's reviewed DGT's
revised 1980-84 investment program, which included the ongoing works under
the Second Plan and new works defined under the Third Plan, and appraisal
for a $17.5 million project designed to improve and expand domestic
facilities. The mission recommended a $7.5 million credit to cover 49Z of
an estimated foreign exchange cost of $15.4 million, the remainder to be
cofinanced in almost equal parts by Canada ($4.0 million) and France ($3.9
million).
2.04     Negotiations took place in Washington, from May 12 to 16, 1980 and
the Government approved the outcome of negotiations on June 5, 1980. The
Board approved the credit on July 29, 1980 and the Credit Agreement was
signed on August 13, 1980. The credit became effective on July 7, 1981
(para 3.01).
Project Objectives
2.05     The main project objectives were improvement and expansion of
telecommunications services, as well as institutional development. More
specifically, they were:
(a) to increase the efficiency of the telecommunications
services, their operation and management;
(b) to expand the services over the whole country, to
support Government's efforts in breaking rural isolation



- 3 -
and to involve the whole country in the economic and
social development process; and
(c) to expand telecommunications services between Rwanda and
other countries for the coordination of transportation,
to facilitate trade, and to overcome the enclave
problem.
These project objectives are also those of DGT's revised 1980-84 investment
program and were also included in the sectoral objectives of the Second and
Third national five-year Plans.
The Project
2.06     The project consisted of the following elements:
(a) the expansion of urbar cable networks in several towns
by about 1,300 main lines, and increase of the number of
subscriber installations by about 3,000, in Kigali and
other main towns;
(b) the installation of a new exchange at Rwamagana,
equipped for 200 lines and the replacement of ten
existing exchanges; the added capacity was to total
about 2,000 lines including installation of call
charging equipment and adaptation of the installation in
Kigali and other exchanges for the interface with the
new trunk exchange;
(c) the installation of an automatic trunk exchange,
equipped for 300 circuits;
(d) the replacement of ten HF and low capacity UHF radio
links with facilities providing adequate reliability and
extended capacity; the installation of microwave
equipment for three new routes;
(e) the expansion of the telex exchange at Kigali, the
provision of teleprinters for 100 additional telex
subscribers, and the installation of voice frequency
telegraph equipment in about 12 centers;
(f) miscellaneous (vehicles, tools, instruments, etc.);
(g) construction of a warehouse and other technical
buildings; and
(h) technical assistance and training services.
2.07     During project preparation and negotiations, the Government was
reluctant to implement simultaneously the proposed accelerated development
in physical facilities and the thorough institutional development and
sector restructuring that would have been suitable to improve sector
efficiency. However, it was agreed that the internal organization of the



telecommunication services would be improved and strengthened under the
proposed first project. Further reforms would be studied for later
consideration. The scope and terms of reference of the engineering and
financial consultancy services needed to carry out the project were defined
and agreed upon in a supplemental letter (of same date) to the Credit
Agreement.
Covenants
2.08     Besides standard covenants on management, procurement and
reporting, the Credit Agreement provides (under the relevant sections
indicated) that the Borrower, through DGT, should:
(a)  prepare memorandum commercial accounts for
telecommunications and furnish such accounts to IDA
within 4 months of end of each FY (3.01(b)];
(b)  engage technical and financial consultants to assist in:
(i) carrying out the project, and management and
operation of the systems; and (ii) preparing memorandum
commercial accounts, revaluing assets, and establishing
accounting and budgetary functions (3.02);
(c)  make adequate provision for the insurance of project
imports [3.03(a)];
(d) furnish IDA with periodic progress reports on project
implementation, costs and benefits derived from it
(3.04(a)];
(e) maintain training facilities and appoir.t teachers in
technical and financial matters (3.06);
(f)  enter into a contract for the construction of the
warehouse before inviting tenders for the procurement of
equipment (3.07);
(g)  appoint independent auditors [4.01(b.i)];
(h) furnish to IDA audited accounts and associated report
within six months of end of FY [4.01(b.ii)];
(i)  maintain DGT's tariffs at a level adequate to produce a
rate of return of at least 102 on revalued assets
(4.02);
(j) furnish to IDA an assets revaluation plan by December
1980 and apply it thereafter (4.03);
(k)  carry out a tariff structure study by June 1981 and
review it with IDA by December 1981 (4.04);
(1)  prepare and furnish to IDA every 6 months an analysis of
accounts receivable (4.05(i)]; and



- 5 -
(m)  establish procedures for billing and collection by
December 1982, to ensure that outstanding receivables
would not exceed four months of DGT's annual operating
revenues (4.05(ii)].
Details of compliance are in Annex 1. The Borrower complied with the five
covenants in sections 3.02, 3.03(a), 3.06, 3.07 with regard to consultants
and project implementation, and with section 4.01(b.i) with regard to the
hiring of auditors. Compliance took place with delays ranging from two to
four years. All other covenants - mostly related to accounts and financial
management - were only partly complied with (seven covenants) or not at all
(one covenant). The submission of progress and financial reports was
irregular or insufficient throughout the project period. The Borrower did
not prepare a project completion report, nor did he express his views on
the benefits and lessons to be expected from the project.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01     The credit agreement stipulated that the cofinancing arrangements
between the Government and the French CCCE and FAC be finalized as
condition of effectiveness (paras 2.02 and 2.03). This took more time than
expected at negotiations; arrangements were signed on April 17 and May 27,
1981, respectively. The credit became effective on July 7, 1981, a year
after Board approval.
3.02     The slippage of effectiveness affected the project start-up by
delaying the engagement of engineering consultants to prepare technical
specifications and tender documentation, and of financial consultants to
prepare commercial accounts, assets revaluation and tariff study. Hiring
of the engineering consultants (SOFRECOM/France) followed up promptly, in
July 1981. The first applications for withdrawals covering the refinancing
of PPF No. P085-RW and initial payments to SOFRECOM were submitted in
August 1981. The initial delay affected the overall implementation
schedule of the project.
Project Revision
3.03     There was no change in the basic composition of the project.
However, as a result of the unfolding planning process and of the rapidly
evolving technology for telecommunications in the early 80's, some project
components (mainly switching equipment) had to be redesigned, and others
implemented using the latest appropriate technology. In particular, the
initial plans proposed to add equipment and extend the main electro-
mechanical exchange (of Philips UR49A type) in Kigali to interface the new
trunk and international electronic exchanges of DC.T's program. Equipment
at reasonable cost was not available for these works and it was decided in
1983 to use electronic digital technique for all networks throughout the
country. The decision was sound, on the whole, and in line with prevailing
technological evolution. Plans were modified to withdraw progressively
from service and replace the Kigali main telephone exchange (with 5,000



- 6 -
lines installed capacity, of which 3,500 in service), and thus the planning
of the local and trunk networks was also modified.
3.04     New switching equipment under the project was entirely cofinanced
by the French CCCE. Tender for the exchanges had already been issued at
the time of the decision, in parallel with tenders for the other systems.
Compositiun of the proposals had to be adjusted to fit the revised
functions and capacities. In particular, the trunk and local functions at
the Kigali main telephone exchange were combined, and the total capacity of
new telephone exchanges was increased from 5,000 to about 9,000 lines. In
combining trunk and local switching in more sophisticated exchanges the new
technology enabled the suppliers to maintain their unit prices for
equivalent capacities. This prevented re-tendering and further slippage in
project implementation. The additional switching capacities to meet
increased demand for telephones and telex over the extended project period
were considered as supplemental works outside the project. These works
were financed by CCCE under a separate financing agreement. Minor
adjustments were made in the distribution and capacities of the other
facilities from the project to fit the revised configuration of exchange
equipment. This mainly concerned the local networks and the interfacing of
long distance transmission systems.
Implementation Schedule
3.05     The completion date in the Credit Agreement is December 31, 1984,
four years after the anticipated effectiveness date. The implementation
schedule showing planned and actual dates for the various project
components is given in Annex 2. Actual implementation of this project took
three years longer than anticipated, for the reasons mentioned thereafter.
(a) Delayed finalization of cofinancing arrangements, by
about ten months, with French CCCE and FAC, and late
hiring of consultants resulted in project start-up being
delayed by about one year (paras 3.01 and 3.02).
(b) A contract for the construction of warehouses to store
project equipment at delivery was to be entered into by
Government, before inviting tenders for the procurement
of equipment to he financed out of the proceeds of the
credit [para 2.08(f)]. Under the current administrative
set-up of government services, the Ministry of Public
Works is responsible for civil works contracts and
insufficient priority was given to this requirement
under the project. In spite of MPC's and DGT's
insistence, the construction contract was signed in
September 1983, about two years later than expected.
Tenders for most project equipment were issued from
October to December 1983, about two years later than
initially planned.
(c) Changes occurred in DGT's program to meet increased
demand through the extended project period and benefit
from new technology. This resulted in adjustments of
the program and of major project components which were



- 7 -
finalized in 1984; it took about one additional year to
install the new facilities. (paras. 3.03 and 3.04).
(d) Construction of regional microwave radio links financed
by IDA and CIDA raised unexpected problems, which
resulted in changes during construction. This concerned
essentially the common utilization of support
infrastructures and the interworking and testing of
transmission and switching equipment. However, the
resulting ten month-delay in the delivery of
transmission systems was absorbed in the extended
delivery time for the switching systems [preceding
para 3.05 (c)].
(e) Land transport of heavy cable items through Uganda
during the civil war suffered extended delays and
resulted in damage and replacement of some deliver4 es.
(f) Finally, the late availability of technical buildings
for the extension of the telex exchange, necessitated
the replacement of equipment units which had suffered
from inappropriate storage in Rwanda.
3.06     In spite of that delay, the complete replacement throughout the
country of obsolete equipment and plant by expanded and modern
telecommunication systems was successfully completed in February 1987, and
service improved considerably. Subscriber trunk dialing (STD) was
introduced nationwide and international trunk dialing (ITD) was also
introduced with major foreign countries. Also, connections of new
subscribers were implemented during the extended project period and were
kept in pace with the new installations as they were provided. At the end
of 1987, 6,560 DELs were in service, or about twice the number of working
DELs at project start-up, in 1981. Additional installed capacity
representing about 3,000 exchange lines was available for further
connections pending the next investment program.
3.07     Little progress had been achieved however in terms of
organizational strengthening and improvement of financial management. In
spite of the employment of consultants and of efforts made to train staff
for the introduction of memorandum commercial accounts and minimal
financial management, credit covenants in this field have been largely
ignored and proved ineffective (para 2.08 and Annex 1). Bank supervision
missions repeatedly ascertained the situation but could only formulate
wishes for improvement. The situation remained insufficiently documented,
only partial accounts were lately available and no remedial action was
taken for improvement.
3.08     Because of inadequate organization and lack of commercial
accounting and accountants, financial management remained ineffective
throughout the project and DGT's financial set-up is still inadequate.
During project supervisions and at project completion, IDA pointed out to
Government that DGT's poor financial performance and its contributing
factors (accounting system, manpower, lack of management information
system, and commercially oriented organization) would require fundamental



- 8 -
restructuring, before a second telecommunications project for which the
Government has requested IDA's assistance could be envisaged.
Cofinancing
3.09     It was proposed at appraisal that the total project's foreign
costs of $15.4 million would be financed by IDA ($7.5 million), the
Canadian Development Aid Agency CIDA ($4.0 million) and the French CCCE and
FAC ($3.9 million). Local costs of $2.1 million were to be financed by the
Government. Following the revision and adjustments of the switching
component for telephone and telex (paras 3.03 and 3.04), the foreign costs
of these items exceeded the initial estimate. Increases in exchange
capacities by about 5,000 telephones and 150 telex lines were financed
under a separate agreement with CCCE, in 1985. Concerning the rest of
DGT's program, OECF of Japan financed the installation of a satellite earth
station and international transit exchange for about $5.0 million, and the
Belgian, Canadian, Dutch and Swiss Aid Agencies financed small projects for
rural telephone, subscriber outside plant, or training schemes in various
parts of the country. No details on the scope and cost of these activities
are available in the files. A donors' round-table organized in February
1988 in Kigali confirmed that further cofinancing for telecommunications in
Rwanda would be available from various bilateral and multilateral sources.
Consultants
3.10     The Credit Agreement required the Government to engage consultants
to assist in designing and implementing the project and in establishing
appropriate management systems and procedures for the planning,
programming, operation and maintenance of the facilities to be implemented
under the project systems and for DGT's financial and accounting functions.
The services provided to assist in carrying out the project are summarized
below.
3.11     Engineering Consultants were hired to:
(a) design, prepare specifications, assist in tender
evaluation and procurement contracts, follow-up of
construction, supervise acceptance tests and training
for switching telex and digital transmission systems:
SOFRECOM, for 72 man-months;
(b) same tasks as above for analog transmission and rural
systems: Teleconseils/CIDA for 14 man-months;
(c) same tasks as above for local networks and subscriber
outside plant: NEPOSTEL, for 78 man-months;
(d) prepare a master plan for telecommunications development
(1982), coordinate project planning and implementation
and develop courses for technicians in DGT's training
institute: PNUD/ITU under project RWA 81/007, for 80
man-months; and
(e) prepare technical aspects of the initial project: (in
1979 IDA/PPF No. P085-RW), 3 man-months in 1979;



elaborate specifications for the extension of the UTR49a
electromechanical exchange: Phillips, two man-months;
and miscellaneous high level advisory assignments in
planning of switching and local network systems: ITU,
one man-month; Dutch PTT, one man-month.
This totals about 252 man-months, or 21 man-years of technical expert
services over the seven-year project period (1980-87).
3.12     Financial consultants were hired to:
(a) help frame memorandum commercial accounts and prepare
the revaluation of assets: CEGIR, for 50 man-months;
(b) audit the accounts: Price Waterhouse from Kinshasa (1980
through 1985 accounts), and SOGEREP from Kigali (1986
accounts); for 18 man-months; and
(c) prepare financial aspects of the initial project:
IDA/PPF No. P085-RW, three man-months in 1979.
This totals about 71 man-months, or six man-years of financial expert
services over the seven-year project period (1980-87).
3.13     DGT's program outside of the project also benefitted from external
expertise, mostly for technical planning and field advice during
construction, concerning the satellite earth station and international
transit exchange (from Japan), rural telecommunications (from Belgium,
Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and the ITU), local networks (Dutch PTT),
postal services (UPU, Belgium and Swiss PTT) and training (ITU and Swiss
PTT). The files contain little information on this assistance which was
generally provided on a grant basis. Tentatively assessed at 25 percent of
the assistance summarized in previous paras 3.11 and 3.12, it would
represent approximately 6 man-years of additional expert services during
the project period (1980-87).
Reporting
3.14     The credit agreement stipulated that DGT should provide to IDA, at
regular intervals, reports concerning the project. Promptly after
completion, the Borrower was also to prepare and furnish to IDA a thorough
report on the execution, initial operation and results from the project.
The procedure for progress reporting was defined and agreed with MPC and
DGT in October 1981. It was only partly followed during project execution
as summarized below with regard to:
(a) Technical Reports: Summary quarterly reports limited to
operational indicators but short of details on project
preparation and implementation were sent by DGT in 1982,
none in 1983 and partly in 1984. More complete reports
were submitted twice a year, on average, from 1985
onwards.



- 10 -
(b)  Financial Reports:  There is no mention of CEGIR's
reporting in Bank files, for the memorandum accounts and
the revaluation of assets; also DGT did not report on
CEGIR activities in 1981-82; only simplified income
statements were produced by DGT, from 1980 to 1982;
audit reports were produced in three batches:
1980-1983, together with recommendations for internal
control, in March 1985, 1984-1985 accounts in December
1986, and 1986 accounts in October 1987.
(c) Completion Report: No completion report was prepared by
MTC or DGT.
In spite of the efforts made by DGT, reporting under the project was
generally insufficient and unsatisfactory. This was due to the lack of
adequate internal reporting and information service within DGT and the
Ministry. At the end of the project period however, DGT introduced an
internal reporting system for construction and operational performance
indicators, (quality of service, volume of sales, receivables). Due to the
lack of reliable commercial accounting system, the monthly management
reports does not include any indicators of financial performance.
Procurement
3.15     DGT was the project's implementing agency.  Being a government
administration, DGT follows government procurement procedures. These
require that procurement action be supervised and finalized through varied
government agencies, other than the technical ministry in charge. Bid
documents, award decision and contracts for goods and services are
processed through the Government Tender Board. All contracts for building
and civil works are prepared and handled by the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW) before being processed through the Government Tender Board. This
latter disposition caused long delays under the project. MPW could not
give sufficient priority to DGT's warehouse subproject. IDA's clearance of
bidding documents, invitations for bids and contract awards took place
between January and September 1983, about two years later than expected at
appraisal. The signing of the contract for the building was a covenanted
prerequisite to the issuance of bids for the other project items [para
2.08(f)]. After procedural delays were overcome, procurement of IDA
financed items presented no major problems.
3.16     Tenders for telecommunications equipment and plant were issued
between October 1983 and June 1984. Actually, the delay in contracting for
the warehouse building (para 3.15) provided useful lead time to resolve
technical issues such as replacement or expansion of the old
electromechanical exchange equipment, and the design and configuration of
new digital switching and transmission systems (paras 3.03 and 3.04).
Procurement was grouped in categories and lots to enable competition and
timely deliveries. Site installation, training and assistance in operation
and maintenance were included in the contracts for telephone and telex
exchanges, and microwave links. All contracts for the IDA financed items
were signed by October 1985.



- 11 -
3.17     With the exception of the 100-line telex exchange, all
installations were completed by the end of 1986. Operation of the new
systems started in February 1987. Telex equipment had suffered from
transportation and storage and replacement of the damaged units further
delayed the installation of the new telex exchange which was commissioned
in December 1987. Considering the complex works involved, the procurement
process from bids issuance to delivery went through rather smoothly and, in
general, within the contractual delivery periods.
Project Costs
3.18     The estimated project costs at the time of appraisal (1980), the
revised costs oni the basis of actual contracts in October 1985, and the
actual project costs are shown in Annex 3. Lacking project cost
accounting, total local costs of the project only include payments in RwF
disbursed out of the revolving fund (Fonds de Roulement), established by
the Ministry of Finance to cover the local expenditures under the project.
Salaries of DGT staff working on the project, however, are not included.
Local costs represent only about 18? of the total costs. A summary is
shown in table 1 below:

(currency of
the credit)
3.19     The above 52Z cost overrun reflects mainly the increase in project
size, but also the variations of the US$/RwF exchange rate in 1985 and
1987, compared with the initial exchange rate of 1980 (+9Z and -14?
respectively.). Expressed in RwF the cost overrun is 30Z, broken down as
22? foreign cost and 40X local costs. Annex 3 shows that foreign cost
increases are mainly due to the larger capacity of telephone switching
equipment, external plant and technical assistance finally contracted for
under DGT's 1984-89 program. The higher capacity derived from the
technical adjustments which were made on the proj_ct iesign, after deciding



- 12 -
to replace rather than to expand existing obsolete switching equipment
(paras 3.03 and 3.04). Local cost overrun is mostly due to price
escalation resulting from delay in project completion.
3.20     At the end of 1985, most IDA financed items had been contracted
for at costs close to the appraisal estimates. Total foreign e. ._ange cost
of these items was about US$7.6 equivalent. Most of the procurement was in
European and Japanese currencies for works to be implemented in 1986-87.
The depreciation by about 202 of the US dollars in relation to these
currencies between contract signing and payments resulted for the
government in a financing gap of about US$ 1 million at project completion.
The matter is still pending and the Government is currently seeking a
solution to obtain the necessary resources to complete payments which are
still due on several contracts financed from the credit.
Disbursements
3.21     The estimated and actual annual cumulative disbursements of the
credit proceeds are given in Annex 4. The slow disbursement o. the credit
was caused by the initial delay in implementation (paras 3.05 and 3.06).
The original closing date was June 30, 1985, and the revised date was June
30, 1987. Committed payments continued to be made until November 30, 1987,
when $7,448,378.68 had been disbursed. The remainder, $51,621.32, was
cancelled on December 31, 1987.
Credit Allocation
3.22     The original and final revised allocations of credit proceeds are
given in Annex 5. The allocation was revised on the basis of the actual
prices of most contracts to be financed by the credit which had been
entered into by the end of 1985. The revised allocation was approved by
IDA in our telex of July 25, 1986. The remaining unallocated category of
$240,000 for price contingencies on undisbursed amounts of about
$5.5 million at that time proved largely insufficient, due to the
unforeseeable depreciation of the US dollars which occurred in 1986-87
(para 3.20).
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.23     The technical consultants having participated in the project are
listed in para 3.11. Besides individuals employed for short term tasks
such as for initial project preparation (PPF) and advice on existing
switching equipment, three main engineering consultant firms were engaged
to assist DGT in planning and implementing specific project components, and
in staff training. In addition, a UNDP/ITU team prepared a Master Plan
(1982) and advised DGT and MTC on the overall coordination of development
planning and implementation. Adding consultants for the program outside of
the project (para. 3.13), a total of about 27 man-years of expertise were
made available to DGT during the seven-year project period. On average,
this represents four experts permanently present in Rwanda over the period.
3.24     Although the consultants were generally competent for the tasks
involved and their contribution was useful, the coordination of several
teams of specialists working on interrelated systems in bilateral,



- 13 -
multilateral or independent environment was clearly insufficient. The
files reflect cases of redundancy or duplication of activities, of too long
studies and discuss'ons, of varied or conflicting technical solutions,
which hampered efficient project execution.
3.25     Aware of the above difficulties, MTC and DGT attempted several
times to improve the coordination of the project/program planning and
construction activities. Meetings were organized with the concerned
donors, their technical representatives and the concerned consultants. The
meetings helped, but the issue of how to determine the optimal nature and
duration of the technical consultancy aervices, and to adjust it to the
size of the development program and the implementation capabilities of the
beneficiary, could not be solved. As a whole, the technical assistance
which was made available to Government from varied sources, in relation to
equipment financing, and was used by DGT during the project period is
excessive for an investment program of about 10,000 exchange lines and
local networks in 12 locations and 12 short range microwave links.
3.26     The creation of a telecommrnications semi-private company, with a
commercially oriented management, as now decided by the Government, will
certainly provide a better solution to ensure coordinated development
planning and project implementation (paras 6.0? and 7.02). This also would
help avoid the duplication of consultancy services in the future.
Government's agreement on the need for a new sector structure and
organization may have been one major accomplishment of the project, and its
establishment would be the main objective of the proposed second project.
3.27     The financial consultants having participated in the project are
mentioned in para 3.12. The assessment of the services provided is as
follows:
(a)  In the case of CEGIR, we question the way fixed assets
prior to 1981 have been accounted for (that was one of
their assignments) since the work for which we have some
evidence is of poor quality: no commercial accounts and
elementary revaluation of assets were the outcome of
their assignment. However, it must be said that the
consultant operated in a barren environment, with no
accounting structure in DGT (see Chapter V).
(b)  In the case of Price Waterhouse (PW), they produced,
rather than audited, financial statements, because of
the absence of proper commercial accounting. However,
it is regrettable that there was no discussion of
revenues in the income statements and that funds flow
and debt service statements were omitted.
(c)  In the case of SOGEREP, even though they recognized that
DGT had no proper accounting methods and procedures,
'8ey stated in the management letter that DGT's
:..nancial situation is: "refletee de manitre sincbre et
reguli6re, en conformite avec les methodes comptables
que la DGT a retenues." ("accurately and regularly
reflected in conformity with DGT's accounting
procedures.").

3.28     Foreign contractors and equipment suppliers performed
satisfactorily. The installation of the telex exchange was delayed due to
litigation on the replacement of parts and units which suffered from
transportation and storage. Despite its delayed start-up, the construction
of stores and exchange buildings was completed satisfactorily.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     The performance indicators set at appraisal and those actually
achieved are compared in Annex 6. The connection of new telephone
subscribers was slightly ahead of forecast from 1980 to 1983, due to the
availability of line units in the existing exchanges. From 1984 on, the
delay in construction of the local networks limited the number of new
subscribers and the forecast number of 5200 subscribers in 1984 was only
reached at the end of 1986. The availability of new digital exchanges from
the project enabled the transfer of all existing lines to new facilities in
early 1987. By December 31, 1987, 1,117 additional subscribers had been
connected and domestic and international trunk dialing facilities were
available to all subscribers througbout the country. As an indicator of
potential demand, from 1980 to 1985, an average of 750 applications were
satisfied. In 1986, the year preceding the commissioning of the new
facilities under the project, this number increased to 2,600, demonstrating
consumer interest. At the end of 1987, the number of applications dropped
to 1050. Following project completion, DGT organized a survey to detect
the hidden potential demand across the country. The result shows that
unsatisfied demand was about equal to the number of customers (6,200
potential customers compared to 6,561 DEL's at the end of 1987). The
connection of telex subscribers was implemented about one year later than
the initial forecast, and all available capacity was utilized at the end of
1985.  Installation of the new telex exchange was delayed until December
1987 and new subscribers could only be connected again in early 1988.
4.02     Gross operating telecommunications revenues reached RwF 806.4
million for 1987, the year of project completion. This figure is close to
the forecast revenues in 1986. It is however premature to assess the real
impact of the project on the overall revenue generation.
4.03     Besides the number of faults per DEL's per year, there were no
performance indicators in the SAR to follow up improvements of the quality
of service during the project period. Information provided by DGT since
1986, however, indicates reasonably low rates of unsuccessful call attempts
in local, national trunk and international services, and a clear
improvement in the number of ftults per DEL's per year, which dropped from
2 in 1980 to 0.6 at project completion. The latest achievement which is
close to the results obtained in developed countries (0.25 to 0.5) is
extremely satisfactory and well above the achievement of other
telecommunications entities across Sub-Sahara Africa. In 1987, percentage
of faults cleared in 48 hours was about 30? in KIgali and on average 35Z
for the country. Although this achievement is still below DGT's objective
of 80 for 1987, it also shows improvement in the maintenance of the local
networks and subscriber plant. Under a possible second project, service
quality indicators, traffic measurements and maintenance monitoring methods



- 15 -
would be further developed and introduced, taking advantage of the
operation and maintenance facilities provided by the integrated modern
digital systems now in operatiot. in DGT's networks.
4.04     The delay in the preparation of bills to subscribers improved
during the project period from two months to less than tw_ weeks on
average. This resulted from the operation of a computer financed by the
credit in 3983 and from applying methods recommended by the consultants.
The situation of unpaid bills has only improved towards the end of the
project period. Receivable subscriber accounts varied between six and 14
months outstanding from 1980 to 1986. Measures taken in 1987, in parallel
with the introduction of the new systems, resulted in a noticeable
improvement of the unpaid arrears from official, semi-official and private
users. At the end of 1987, receivables had been reduced to five months
which is close to the covenanted four months in the credit agreement.
(para. 2.08(m)].
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Management
5.01     There has been no financial management of DGT throughout the
project period. What has finally been achieved is a compromise between
what the Bank requires within a framework of organized accounting and what
DGT was capable to implement: a sketchy recording of revenues, expenses
and payments gathered in simplified income statements. They were presented
in a collection of "audited" statements, from 1980 to 1986, which should
more properly be termed educated guess statements.
5.02     A financial expert from CEGIR, financed by the project, was in
Kigali from September 1981 to December 1982. His agreed terms of reference
were to introduce:
(a) the analysis of accounts receivable and billing
collection;
(b) a management information system;
(c) the setting up of memorandum commercial accounts and
registering and revaluation of fixed assets; and
(d) a tariff study.
We assume that the expert soon realized that he could not perform
efficiently, because there was no qualified personnel, no training
incentive, assets were "managed" in the Ministry of Public Works, payroll
was kept in the Ministry of Civil Service, payments by customers were not
mandatory and he therefore could not implement his terms of reference. DGT
has kept its rudimentary accounting practices and we have received audited
statements, produced in 1985, 1986 and 1987, which are practically
maaningless. The lesson to be drawn is to use frequent supervision
missions to correct the course of project implementation.

5.03     In this context and based un information from the files, DGT's
proforma financial statements have been prepared from 1979 to 1986 and are
given in Annexes 7 to 9. DGT's main financial indicators can be summarized
as follows:

*/ Rates of return on book values.
The financial performance began to lag behind forecasts in 1983, when
revenues fell below 90? of forecasts, wivh a reprieve in 1984. Revenues
fell more deeply in 1985 and 1986 (67? of forecasts), because tariffs were
not raised to match increases in expenses (the operating ratio soared to
75? in 1984 and reached 94Z in 1986). The rate of return was well above
the agreed target of 10? in 1980, and from 1982 to 1984, but it fell below
10? in 1985 and 1986, even when calculated on book valued assets. Current
ratios were high because of the high level of receivables which were much
higher than the agreed target of four months throughout the duration of the
project, but particularly from 1984 to 1986.
Financial Plan
5.04     No financial plan is available because of the absence of funds
flow statements. Also no statements on debts, and debt service, are



- 17 -
available. As part of the setting-up of a commercially oriented
telecommunications entity with adminis_rative and financial autonomy (to be
supported by a new project), a full set of financial opening statements and
projections will have to be prepared.
Financial Covenants
5.05     Given the financial performance reported above, compliance with
financial covenants has been poor throughout the duration of the project.
Even auditing, which has been performed for all financial years but 1987,
was only national, as DGT has no proper accounting, in spite of its
commitment to prepare a memorandum of commercial accounting: elementary
double entry bookkeeping is still not used by DGT. Moreover:
(a) the rate of return has been below 102 for the last two
audited financial statements, in 1985 and 198, though it
jumped to 252 in 1987, when calculated on book values,
which is probably close to 10? on revalued fixed assets;
(b) CEGIR devised a statistical indexation of assets by an
arbitrary rate of 6Z, probably related to inflation,
which is no substitute to proper revaluation and was
abandoned by the auditors starting with the 1984
accounts, without explanation;
(c) CEGIR produced a tariff study, but it was reported to be
theoretical and of poor quality; and
(d) the level of receivables has consistently exceeded the
covenanted four month period and even exceeded twelve
months, in 1985, though it was down to five months in
1987.
5.06     In retrospect, it appears that the main reason for the lack of
compliance with the covenants is that they were originally set well above
DGT's realistic capabilities and were not closely enough monitored.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01     The borrower was the Government and the implementing agency of the
project was DGT. As usual, under such set-up of telecommunications
services as a Government department, management was highly concentrated in
the hands of the Minister in charge (MPC followed by MTC). The replacement
of DGT by a commercially oriented entity under appropriate statute had been
discussed during project preparation. However, Government considered not
to have yet enough experience in state run or autonomous enterprises for
public services. Rather than immediate restructuring, it was agreed that
internal organizational and management improvements would be made under the
project to strengthen DGT and render it more efficient. To this effect,
substantial engineering and financial technical assistance financed by IDA



- 18 -
was included in the project. Most of the specific covenants of the credit
agreement related to the introduction of memorandum commercial accounting
and auditing procedures within DGT and the strengthening of its financial
and budgeting management (para. 2.08). Further restructuring would be
considered in the medium or longer term, in particular within a proposed
project under DGT's next development program, for which government
requested IDA assistance in 1983.
6.02     A first step in internal reorganization was undertaken in 1983, by
better defining the terms of reference and tasks for the directors of
operations, planning and the chief of administration and finance. Senior
officers were sent abroad for specialized training. However, management
improvements remained impeded by the departmental status of DGT and the
bureaucratic approach prevailing in government administration. In
particular, the actual control of DGT's financial and contractual matters
remained with the Ministry of Finance whose main concern is to limit,
reduce or delay expenses, regardless of their negative impact on revenue
generation and maintenance of the systems. Also the handling of human
resources and environmental activities, for civil works and buildings,
remained within the responsibility of other ministries, in charge of civil
service and public works, respectively. In addition, two different
Ministers and three Directors General have been in charge of
telecommunications during the project period, when large investments and
fundamental technical and operational changes were being implemented. On
the whole, from the managerial and organizational point of view, little has
been accomplished.
6.03     The issue of improving the institutions and management of the
sector, and its efficiency, was repeatedly discussed with Government and
DGT during supervision of the current project and the preparation of a new
project. The latter had to wait due to delays in completing DGT's ongoing
program and in preparing further restructuring of the sector. In the
meantime, a study of the posts and telecommunications restructuring
requirements was undertaken in 1987 under the IDA financed Study Fund
(Subproject No. 23). Based on the results of the study, the Government
decided, at the end of 1987, to set up separate autonomous entities for the
two activities, a "Regie des postes" for postal services and a "Soci4te
d'economie mixte" for telecommunications. It became clear that Government
was keen to press ahead with the restructuring. The Bank has expressed its
approval to the proposed changes and is insisting on the need to prepare
them thoroughly, including a dated plan of action for their implementation
with adequate outside assistance.
6.04     In spite of the limited success of the first project, IDA's
continued involvement in telecommunications in Rwanda would be justified in
order to help implement such sectoral reform and, simultaneously, the next
DGT's development program within the framework of the 4th Plan (1987-1991).
Staffing, Recruitment and Training
6.05     At the time of appraisal, DGT had a permanent staff of 470 (about
140 per 1,000 DELS). This figure rose to 600 (96 per 1,000 DELs) at
project completion. An actual decrease in staff ratio became noticeable
only during the last years of the project, when a larger number of new
lines could be connected. Further reductions remain necessary to increase



- 19 -
efficiency. Throughout the project period, shortages of skilled employees
and the need for training abroad constrained project implementation and
institutional strengthening. Simultaneously, overstaffing at lower levels
increased operating costs. Participation of the staff in construction
works mitigated these effects to a certain extent. Meanwhile, civil
service regulations continued to limit flexibility for hiring, tasks and
performance related pay scales, and training. In particular, sufficient
staff could not be recruited to establish DGT's finance and accounting
division on a suitable basis. Improvement in these fields is related to
institutional reform (para 6.02).
6.06     DGT's technical training school was opened in 1979, a year before
project start-up. The school has been established with the assistance of
the Swiss government and UNDP/ITU. The training program was designed
primarily for lower level and semi-skilled employees. Outside assistance
in training equipment and teachers continued through 1985, when DGT took it
over. The school, however, is suffering from capacity constraints. It
lacks resources in several disciplines, in particular management and
accounting training, and at skilled levels. Personnel at these and higher
levels must be trained outside Rwanda. The project included items to this
effect which were implemented by DGT, as needed and planned. Accounting
courses were held by the financial consultants but discontinued after their
departure. Other teaching cycles included in the project were also
completed. There is still, however, a lack of staff, training equipment
and continuity in the production of the required courses. Given these
constraints, it is recommended that further assistance in coordination with
all concerned donors be provided under the proposed project.
Accounting and Auditing
6.07     The fact that DGT has no formal double entry accounting and that
only - few simple income statements were sent by DGT to the Bank, indicates
th'  ..he auditors, rather than DGT's accounting branch, have produced the
financial statements themselves. Much remains to be done to establish and
strengthen DGT's accounting procedures and, more generally, to provide the
sector with adequate tools and improve its financial management.
6.08     From available information, it appears that current DGT accounting
system presents the following weaknesses or deficiencies:
(a) There is no register of assets and there has been no
financial analysis of investments, either from the
project or from other lenders' projects. Whatever CEGIR
may have done to organize the register of assets was not
implemented, and the amount of fixed assets before 1981,
determined by them, is unreliable;
(b) No funds flow statements have been produced by the
auditors, which could have shed some light on the
variations of net fixed assets (for instance, the
variations are negative in 1985 and 1986). There has
been no analysis of works in progress, the amount of
which was verv large in 1985 and 1986 (63Z and 185Z
respectively, of net fixed assets, with no explanation);



- 20 -
(c) As a consequence of the absence of register of assets
and the non production of funds flow statements, the
content of the fixed assets account in the balance sheet
is meaningless. While there was a RwF 2.4 billion
investment between the end of 1980 and the end of 1986,
the total gross fixed assets and works-in-progress were
reduced by RwF 1,084 million and the total of net fixed
assets by RwF 1,371 million during the period.
Similarly, the contents of the equity and long term debt
accounts are equally meaningless.
(d) The asset revaluation proposed by CEGIR is meaningless
and has been abandoned by the auditors from the 1984
accounts on, which shows that the results for rates of
return are overvalued.
(e) The amount of receivable accounts is underestimated,
because unpaid bills from official subscribers
(Government presumably) are deducted from the
Government's subsidy to DGT (official unpaid bills are
said to represent 572 of total receivables, but they do
not appear in the audited accounts for 1986), and it is
not clear whether receivables from previous years are
added to current receivables.
6.09     In spite of the efforts made, DGT's accounting situation is very
poor and its financial performance mediocre. The recent surge in operating
revenues (total revenues in 1987 were twice the revenues of 1986) following
the introduction of subscriber dialing in trunk and international services
should enable to improve the situation. It is recommended however, that a
thorough action plan be prepared and measures promptly taken to improve and
straighten the accounting and financial system of the sector.
6.10     As regards auditing, the auditors seemed to have been obliged to
perform a job of bookkeepers. However, they have not produced an analysis
of the revenues and yearly funds flow statements, and an assessment of
DGT's debt position.
Tariffs
6.11     DGT's tariffs remained basically unchanged since 1975.
International tariffs only were adjusted in 1982 and 1987, in line with
changes made in agreements between most countries and the changing value of
the "franc-or' used in international arrangements for telecommunications
charges. A summary of the tariffs at time of appraisal and current tariffs
is shown in Annex 11.
6.12     A tariff study was undertaken by CEGIR in 1982 (para 5.05) as part
of the project. It was modified in several aspects at Bank suggestion
during supervision.  The study was submitted to Government in 1983 but no
action on tariffs resulted. An updating of the study was initiated by
Government in 1986, following DGT's decreasing rate of return. The
updating was reportedly completed in early 1988. However, neither the
results of both studies nor proposals for tariff adjustments have been



- 21 -
released to the Bank. The issue of DGT's ability to adjust its tariffs
regularly in response to the changing cost and economic factors has been a
continued difficulty under the project. It is important that this issue be
firmly addressed and resolved in the proposed project, within the context
of the restructuring of the sector (para 6.03).
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01     The project achieved and in some cases went beyond its physical
objectives, though this took a longer time than expected at appraisal
(paras 3.05, 3.06 and 4.01). Local and long distance networks and access
to international service have improved, together with the introduction of
modern and expanded systems. Access to and quality of service have
improved throughout the systems, in particular due to the completion of the
interurban links to interconnect telephone subscribers in provincial towns
and rural development centers, providing them with nation wide automatic
service. Annex 6 compares performance indicators estimated at appraisal
with actuals.
7.02     Institutional achievements were minor.  The financial management
goals set at appraisal to provide DGT with accounting tool and information
systems to enable a more efficient and productive operation and development
as a commercially oriented entity, were only partly met, or not at all
(paras 5.01, 5.02 and 6.02). However, the Government realized the
importance of this matter during the last two years of the actual project
and the need to remedy such failure. As a result, an overall study of the
sector status and restructuring requirements was undertaken in 1987. The
Government has now indicated its intention to reorganize rapidly the
telecommunications sector into a "corporation" or "Societe d'economie
mixte,' combining public and private ownership and interests (para 6.03).
Assisting in successfully implementing such reform and in the start-up of
the new entity would be the main rationale for continued IDA involvement in
the sector under a second project. It is recommended that a firm stand be
taken during preparation of this second project on the organizational
aspects and management factors which were not fully considered under
current project (para 6.04).
Project Spin-Off
7.03     There was no special spin-off from the project.  Rwanda is a small
land-locked country and practically all components used for
telecommunication networks will continue to be imported in the foreseeable
future. Local civil works and building contractors performed
satisfactorily under the project and this also should continue in the
future.
Least Cost Solution
7.04     DGT in general adopted system design and components consistent
with least costs under the project. The discounted cost of adopting fully



- 22 -
automatic digital switching and transmission equipment (paras 3.03 and
3.04) is lower than the discounted cost of the electromechanical solution
first proposed at appraisal. This choice of technology is fully consistent
with current Bank practice and policy. Furthermore, the IDA financed part
of the project was procured through ICB for various types of equipment,
including switching, transmission, telex and local networks. This enabled
DGT to obtain competitive prices for similar goods and systenms otherwise
financed. The higher capital cost was due to the provision of enlarged
functions and some additional services for switching equipment in Kigali,
and to delays in placing the orders for other equipment (para. 3.06).
Rate of Return
7.05     The re-estimated rate of return for the project (investment
program 1980-1987) was 18X, on the basis of information concerning the 1987
DGT income statement and forecast for the 1988 income statement. The
methodology which was used is outlined in Annex 10. The rate estimated at
appraisal was 12? attributable to the then proposed 1980-84 program. The
rate of return, though a fair estimate of measureable economic benefits,
does not account for all project externalities and understates the overall
economic benefits of the project such as the consumer surplus. It also
does not account for the effect of network and service deterioration that
would have resulted had the project not been implemented. The rate of
return is therefore, actually higher than 18Z.
VIII.  IDA PERFORMANCE
Overall Contribution
8.01     IDA's performance was generally satisfactory.  In retrospect,
there were some weaknesses at different stages of project appraisal and
implementation. However, considering the conservative approach to
institutional aspects to which the Government adhered, it is not evident
that more timely and better results could have been obtained, even if IDA
had been more insistent. The goals targeted generally require time to be
attained, in particular in the context of prevalent management and
technical problems to be resolved and overcome.
8.02     The IDA's contribution at the stage of preparation was positive,
clarifying the organizational, managerial and technical problems of the
sector through the Project Preparation Facility, and deciding that it was
justified to supplement bilateral with multilateral financing, as sought by
Government. At appraisal, however, IDA could have made a more realistic
assessment of the Borrower's institutional capacities with regard to : (i)
the implementation of a relatively large program involving several sources
of financing and complex technical aspects necessitating outside assistance
and its coordination (paras 3.01 to 3.03); and (ii) the overcoming of
internal bureaucratic constraints in project implementation resulting from
DGT's set-up as a government department. Implementation nonetheless showed
that both problems were in fact dealt with concurrently, during the three
years delay in project start-up (para 3.06).



- 23 -
8.03     The proposed revisions in the technical solutions to be used in
DGT's overall program and the resulting adjustments in project
implementation were promptly examined and commented upon by IDA. The
procurement process was smooth and prompt in accordance with Bank
guidelines. IDA persistently raised with Government the importance of
improving DGT's billing and collection, accounting and auditing procedures,
as agreed under the credit. However, the results in these fields, as well
as the tariff study and DGT's financial position were disappointing
(paras 5.01 to 5.05).
8.04     During the last two years of project implementation, Government
recognized the merits of IDA's insistence on the institutional and
financial aspects and the need for sector reform. Thus, together with the
preparation of the financing requirements for DGT's 1987-91 program, the
decision was taken in 1987 to prepare and proceed rapidly with the reform
(para 6.03).
Supervision
8.05     IDA's supervision over the period 1980-87 averaged about two
missions each year. A total of 13 supervision missions were conducted.
This would be adequate under a first project in a sector confronted with
both institutional and technical problems. Only about 40? of these
missions included staff for both technical and financial aspects of the
project. This may have reduced the thoroughness and the possible impact of
supervision, in particular with regard to accounting, financial and tariff
aspects of the project. The comments made on DGT's financial performance
and relevant information in paras 5.01 to 5.06 above were only partly made
to the Borrower during supervision. The delays and insufficiencies in the
submission of DGT's financial statements (before and after audit) also made
supervision difficult. This, however, may have resulted in lesser or
delayed attention to IDA's expression of concern with the unsatisfactory
compliance with the financial aspects of the project.
Working Relationship
8.06     The relationship between Government, DGT and IDA was good.  There
were no major procurement or technical issues due to unfamiliarity with the
Bank's procurement guidelines, as often is the case under first projects.
DGT has not always kept IDA timely or fully informed, in particular with
regard to financial matters, tariffs and completion report (para. 3.14).
Nonetheless, Bank insistence on the need to consider seriously
institutional reform, in particular as a likely prerequisite to continued
sector assistance, was finally fruitful (para.6.03). In this context, the
working relationship on a possible second project should be excellent.
This would greatly help in the prompt achievement of most sector goals.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The main problems encountered in this project were:
(a) delays in project implementation;



- 24 -
(b) lack of adequate action on accounting, auditing and
tariffs;
(c) lack of adequate and qualified staff; and
(d) overextended outside assistance and the resulting
difficulties in efficient coordination of development
activities.
Most of the problems are related, in fact, to the belated attention given
by the Government to establish DGT as an autonomous, commercially-oriented
entity rather than a government department.
9.02     The project achieved its physical objectives, although with a
three-year delay, and contributed to improvement and development of the
Rwandese telecommunications network. The targets for institutional
development were partially attained.
9.03     The principal findings and lessons learned from the project are:
(a) In preparation of the project schedule, greater account
should have been taken of the lead time required to
conclude external cofinancing assignments for major
project components.
(b) Similarly, more attention should have been given to the
bureaucratic constraints resulting from the
administrative set-up of DGT's activities.
(c) During project preparation, a more realistic assessment
of telephone and telex demand should also have been
made, as both forecasts were underestimated.
(d) IDA should have insisted more upon the Borrower's
compliance with the accounting and external auditing
requirements, and should have considered more seriously
the significance and outcome of the tariff study.
(e) IDA should have supervised more closely the activities
mentioned in the preceeding sub-paragraph, as well as
DGT's general financial status during and at the outcome
of the project.
(f) DGT benefitted from extended outside technical
assistance under its program, in the project and from
other donors. Some of this assistance was redundant.
IDA could have suggested that more efficient
coordination be exercised in this field, for example, by
establishing a supervisory group under the Ministry's or
DGT's authority.
(g) Similarly, DGT benefited under its development program
from financial assistance by six countries and two
multilateral organization. Aid coordination to sector



- 25 -
development could have been improved, for example, by
establishing an appropriate coordinating group to advise
the concerned ministerial authorities.
9.04     The Government has requested a second IDA intervention in the
sector to continue and complete the assistance initiated under the first
project. An important step was made towards resolving the institutional
issue of the sector when Government decided, at the end of 1987, to set-up
two separate autonomous entities for posts and for telecommunications, to
be operated on a fully commercial basis. In this context, there is a
strong rationale for continued IDA involvement in the sector, in particular
for its assistanct 'n implementing the sectoral reforms which are being
prepared. The experience gained through the first project should be fully
accounted for by IDA and the Borrower when preparing and implementing the
proposed pro,ect, to strengthen management and organization of the new
entities and to speed development of the services. Considering the
observations m%de on technical assistance and external aid coordination,
the employment of a limited number of high-level operational experts could
usefully be envisaged to assist the two new entities in the technical and
financial fields. This should facilitate the prompt establishment on the
right footing and the efficient start-up of the reorganized postal and
telecommunications sectors in Rwanda, and of their operation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Rate of Return
The total capital expenditures of RwF 2.4 billion were spread over
the six years of the project, the first works were undertaken at the end of
1981 and the last at the end of 1986.   The revenues linked to the project
generated an income of RwF 181 million in 1986, RwF 451 million in 1987 and
RwF 650 million in 1988 and thereafter, as estimated on the basis of
preliminary information obtained from DGT.
The rate of return of 18.0 is the rate that gives a zero value to
the discounted cash flow of capital expenditures and income over the period
1981-2005.
