MEXICO
OCORONI IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
The Resource Base
1.01      Mexico has a land area of about 2 million km2 with a population
of almost 67 million (mid-1978 estimate), growing at an annual rate of 2.9%.
Approximately 40% of the total population (25 million) secures its livelihood
from agriculture. Agriculture 1s also an important foreign exchange earner,
comprising approximately 22% of the total value of exports in 1977. The
wide range in latitude and altitude permits the growth of a great diversity
of crops and fosters livestock output. The extent of arid and mountainous
lands is so large, however, that only 18% of the total area (35 million ha)
is considered cultivable. Of this, only about 15 million ha are harvested,
of which an estimated 5 million ha are under irrigatíon. On a worldwide
basis, Mexico ranks sixth in terms of land under irrigation.
Agricultural Production
1.02      From 1945 to 1965, the value of agricultural production grew more
than 5% per year. After 1965, however, production growth rates of major
cereal crops fell behind the growth in domestic demand. As a result, agricul-
ture's contribution to the GDP declined from 16% in 1960 to about 10% in
1976/77. Nonetheless, in contrast to the slow growth in crop production,
livestock production increased steadily throughout the 1970s at an average
annual rate of about 4%. The volume of agricultural production from 1961 to
1979 ís shown in Annex 1, Table 1.
1.03      The main reasons for the fast growth rate in agricultural production
between 1945 and 1965 were the rapid expansion of irrigated lands and the
results of successful research on irrigated crops. After 1965, however,
a drop in agricultural production occurred when the physical complexity
and cost of large-scale irrigation schemes rose sharply and private invest-
ments declined. The latter situation was caused by the uncertainty of many
landowners in regard to titles to their land.
1.04      Maize is Mexico's most widely grown crop, accounting for about
8 million ha, or over half the country's cultivated area. Most of it is
grown under rainfed conditions along with smaller areas of beans by small-
scale farmers in the central and southern highlands along the Gulf Coast and
in the State of Chiapas. In the humid tropical region along the southern Gulf
Coast and Chiapas State, sugarcane, bananas, cacao and coffee are grown.
1.05      Livestock is also an important component of Mexican agriculture.
In the past, most of the commercial output came from the aríd and semi-arid
range lands of the north, where extensive cattle breeding took place. Cattle-
men earned relatively high income from the sale of feeder cattle, mainly
to the United States market.  Milk, hogs, and poultry were produced in small
quantities, primaríly in the central highlands, mostly for subsistence.



-2-
The increase in domestic demand, however, caused a rapid expansion in produc-
tion throughout the country. The growth of Mexico City substantially contrí-
buted to the rapid increase in supply of milk, pork, and, in the central
plateau, poultry. Also in response to this demand, new cattle producing areas
were developed, mainly along the Gulf Coast where better rainfall and improved
pastures enabled a much higher stocking rate than was possible in the more
arid regions.
1.06      Since 1965, the gross value of crop production has been growing
moderately at approximately 1.3% per annum in real terms, mainly because
of the relatively slow rise in average yields, increased limítations on
agricultural exports, unfavorable market situations, and a relatively slow
expansion of irrigated lands. While the gross values of cotton and sugarcane
virtually declined or remained the same, those of grains and oilseeds
increased by 1.5% to 3.0%, respectively. If average yields are used to
measure relative performance, the best results have been obtained in the
northern region where yields, primarily grains, rose by 36% between 1965 and
1978. Wheat accounted for most of the growth as its yield doubled from 1.5
tons per ha in 1965 to 3 tons per ha in 1974. In the Pacific and Central
Regions, yields of all crops rose by 20%. This has been due mainly to a
substantial decrease in the area devoted to low value crops (maize and beans)
which was partly compensated by an increase in high yielding crops, maínly
sorghum in the Central Region and sugarcane in the Pacific Region. In the
Northwest, the fastest growing region in terms of gross value of production,
yields increased by 7%. Accounting for most of this growth was the introduc-
tion of oilseeds (soybeans) as a second crop in the commercially oriented
irrigation districts of the region. The Gulf Region and the state of Tamaulipas
had the lowest performance. In the Gulf Region, only sugarcane showed an
upward trend, confirming the suitability of the zone for the crop.
1.07      Since 1965, in contrast to crops, livestock has maintained, and,
in recent years, even increased its growth. This was mainly a response
to an increase in demand for livestock products, which far exceeded supply
capabilities of some areas. Consequently, Mexico has been importing powdered
milk since mid-1970.
Rural Population, Employment, and Income
1.08      The agricultural sector provides the livelihood for a rural popula-
tion of some 4 million families scattered among 95,000 villages, totalling
more than 25 million people. Unemployment and under-employment are serious
problems. With a rural labor force of between 8 and 12 million people and a
harvested area fluctuating around 15 million ha, the ratio of cropped area to
potential active population is between 1.3 and 2.0 ha per person. This is
quite low when the land use pattern (about two-thirds of the cropped area
devoted to grains) is considered. This is one of the major causes determining



- 3 -
the level of income in the agricultural sector, whích is lower than that of
other sectors, as the following table shows:
GDP Per Worker (1975) 1/
US$              Index
Agriculture                         120               100
National Average                    384               320
Industry and Services               504               420
1/   Based on data of "Prontuario Estadistico de la Secretaria de Recursos
Hídraulicos" (SRH) Mexico, D.F., 1976.
Moreover, the income distribution pattern within the agricultural sector is
skewed, since 50% of the rural famiuies account for only about 20% of the
agricultural output, while the upper 10% of the agricultural population
provides 50%.
Government Policies
1.09      Within the agricultural sector, Government policies are directed
primarily toward increasing production of basic food crops (maize, wheat
and rice) so as to reach self-sufficiency by 1982 and increasing income levels
as well as generating rural employment. Because of favorable prospects for
increasing petroleum revenues and export earnings, Mexico now has the
means to diversify its agricultural development program. Such action would
enable more farmers to reach higher levels of productivity, thereby providing
a higher sector growth rate similar to the earlier periods. To meet these
objectives, Government is pursuing the following strategies:
(a) improving productivity in existing rainfed agriculture by expanding
the area and developing a more effective extension service (Govern-
ment in 1977 created "Distritos de Temporal" or rainfed districts);
(b) expanding rainfed cultivation in under-utilized lands, mostly along
the Gulf Coast. The latter will require investments in drainage and
flood control, but it will also necessitate a strong effort by its
research services to develop adequate crop technologies, and an
expansion of extension services in order to stimulate the farmers to
adopt better cultural techniques;
(c) planning large-scale irrigation projects to develop areas where a
hydraulic potential exists, expanding irrigated lands through
small-scale irrigation systems, improving performance in presently
irrigated areas through rehabilitation of old conveyance systems,
reclaiming saline lands, and making more efficient use of available
water; and



-4-
(d) using price support programs to induce changes in cropping
patterns favoring increased production of food crops.
1.10      The Bank's lending program to Mexico's agricultural sector, on-going
or under preparation, contains a number of projects that would promote the
policies of the Government as outlined above. The proposed project, designed
to expand irrigated land in an area where a low cost hydraulic potential
exists, would mesh with the Government's strategy.
Previous Bank Prolects
1.11      In the past seven years (FY 1974/80), Bank participation in the
agricultural sector amounted to US$1.497 billion distributed among 13 projects
as follows:
(a) Irrigation (Panuco, Sinaloa, Fuerte/Sinaloa, Bajo Bravo/Bajo
San Juan and Apatzingan) - US$451 million;
(b) Rural Development (Integrated Program for Rural Development (PIDER) I
and II and Papaloapan Basin) - US$280 millíon;
(c)  Credits V, VI and VII Project - US$650 míllion;
(d) Area Development (Tropical Agriculture) - US$56 míllion; and
(e) Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Development - US$60 million.
Implementation of the irrigation projects was delayed, initially mainly
because of budgetary constraints.  Accentuating these delays were large price
increases unforeseen at appraisal. Thus, the Government and Bank agreed that
the projects should be financed over a longer period of time. This decision
led to the reformulation of the Bajo Bravo/Bajo San Juan project, with subse-
quent cancellation of US$100 million (from an original loan of US$150 million).
To assist in financing .cost overruns of the Panuco Project, a supplementary
loan of US$25 million was approved by the Bank on July 11, 1978. With these
actions, implementation of the above projects is now progressing satisfac-
torily. PIDER I and II are multi-sectoral projects designed for improving
living conditions and increasing productivity in localized areas of rural
poverty (micro-regions). After some difficulties inherent in the nature of
such projects, and decentralization of the decision-making process, overall
progress of these projects is improving. The Papaloapan project had a slow
start due to a severe shortage of funds, a situation that was corrected by
increasing budget appropriations, beginning in early 1979. Implementation and
disbursements have since been stepped up although an extension still appears
necessary to complete the project. The dísbursement pace of the Fifth and
Sixth Credit Projects was faster than projected. Full disbursement of the
Fifth Credit was reached by June 1979, seven months ahead of the origínal
schedule of January 1, 1980. The Sixth Credit Project became effective on
January 12, 1979 and, by June 1980, more than 80% had been disbursed. A
Seventh Credit project was approved by the Board on July 8, 1980. The
Tropical Agriculture Project also became effective on January 12, 1979, and,
although implementation is behind schedule, the pace is accelerating. The
Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Development Project became effective



on April 13, 1979 and the Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project, which
became effective on October 5, 1979, are proceeding on schedule.
1.12      The Bank has completed audit reports on the first four agricultural
loans to Agricultural Trust Funds of the Bank of Mexico (FIRA), and a comple-
tion report on the fifth loan is now being prepared. The trend in Bank lending
has stressed increased lending to low-income producers, increased emphasis on
crop rather than livestock production, and less emphasis on models and more
emphasis on sector orientation in loan preparation. Altogether, the credit
loan series has absorbed US$925 million of Bank funds, making the program one
of the largest in the Bank's agricultural portfolio. An audit report on the
Mexico Third Irrigation Project (Loan 450-ME) revealed that performance of the
borrower was generally satisfactory and that no major technical, organizational,
or management difficulties were experienced. The audit cited, however, that
the Borrower had not fully complied with two loan conditions: one concerned
with controlling ground water extraction and the other with recovery of the
costs of operation and maintenance in part of the project area and recovery of
additional investment charges over the entire project area.
1.13      In  general, recognized difficulties have been overcome in that
technical services and on-farm investments, which are essential in meeting
project obJectives, are now included in project costs, and sensitivity analyses
are being made on construction delays and effects of price changes and bene-
fits. The Bank has also become more involved in project preparation and
in the determination of the readiness of projects for preparation and imple-
mentation than it has been previously. Finally, the Bank has endeavored to
obtain a just recovery of water charges in the irrigation projects it finances,
and it is now becoming involved in a more general study of operation and
maintenance and of levels of water charges in Mexican irrigation districts.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project area is located in a valley named after the Ocoroní
River, which is a tributary of the Sinaloa River in the northern part of
the State of Sinaloa on the Pacific coast, about 30 km north/northeast of
the city of Guasave. The valley covers about 30,000 ha at an elevation
that ranges between 115 m above sea level in the eastern part and about 70 m
in the western part (see Map IBRD 15140). The Ocoroní River is not regulated
and therefore there is presently no irrigation in the valley.
Climate
2.02      The climate of the project area is classified as tropical semi-
arid.  Temperatures vary between a miminum of -2 C ín December and 44 0C in
June. However, such extreme temperatures occur quite rarely and monthly
average temperatures vary from 17.9 0C in January to 30.3 0C in July (Annex 1,
Table 2).



-6-
2.03      Average annual rainfall in the project area is about 558.5 mm,
but time of onset and time of termination of rains are quite variable
(Annex 1, Table 3). Rainfed agriculture basically relíes on three months
of rainfall in the summer season. Distribution of rains is irregular and it
often falls with high intensity; daíly precipitation of over 155 mm has been
recorded. The area, therefore, has only marginal qualities for rainfed crops,
and where they are grown, they are typically restricted to draught-resistant
and short maturing crops, such as sesame, sorghum, and groundnuts. Evapo-
transpíration rate amounts to about 1,300 mm, whích exceeds the average
monthly precipitation in all months.
Soíls
2.04      A semí-detaíled soil survey has been carried out over the entire
valley area (29,500 ha). About 21,700 ha were identified as having potential
for agricultural development, but with varying constraints.  Within this
net area, 10,000 ha of irrigable land has been demarkated.
2.05      The project soíls are derived from riolitic ash and boulders,
with little weathering or leaching and overlayed by recent alluvials in
the viciníty of the river, while colluvial deposits with gravel conglomerates
overlie the soils adjacent to the foothills. They are of líght to medium
texture and neutral or slightly alkaline, moderately drained and wlth no
potential salinity or drainage problems. Organic matter content is low
and all soils require both nitrogren and phosphate applícations.
2.06      Soils have been classifed according to U.S. Water and Power Resources
Servlce 1/ standards; all lands fall within classes I to IV with close to 70% of
the 10,000 ha demarkated for irrigation, in classes I and II.  A summary of the
land classification is given below:
Class I soils                 4,582 ha
Class II soils                2,359 ha
Class III soils               1,758 ha
Class IV soils                1,301 ha
Total                        10,000 ha
2.07      The main limitations are imposed by the class IV lands, which
are shallow with surface rock and gravels within the profile. This land is
now beíng cleared of brush and rocks, after which it can be reclassified as
class III. Therefore, class III land would increase to 3,059 ha.
Hydrology
2.08      The principal source of water for the Ocoroni Valley is the Ocoroni
River whose two largest tributaries are the San Rafael and the San Jose. The
quantities of underground water within the project lands are limited as was
proven last year when exploratory wells yielded less than 5 liters/sec. The
rivers have a low salinity content and their water quality is suitable for
irrigation.
1/   Previously called Bureau of Reclamation.



-7-
2.09      The catchment area of the 9coroni River, upstream of the proposed
dam aS El Sabinal, is about 1,305 km and brings an average annual flow of
160 m millions to the dam site. About 90% flows during a four-month rainy
season--July to October--but occasionally there are floods in December and
January. The rest of the year the river is practically dry. Details of
monthly flows over the last 40 years are in Annex 1, Table 4. Presest annual
extraction from the river is small and seasonal, about 40 millions m  which is
used to irrigate part of the lands of the Sinaloa Project located on the ríght
bank of the Sinaloa River. With the completion of the Sinaloa Project, these
lands would be irrigated directly by the Sinaloa rather than by the Ocoroni.
Present Irrigation System
2.10      Presently, the Ocoroni Valley is not irrigated and, therefore,
there is no water infrastructure in the project area.  Occasionally, however,
during the rainy season, some farmers divert water to lands along the river
banks through temporary facilities.
Land Tenure
2.11      No land is held under private ownership in the Ocoroni Valley.
There are, however, three ejidos settlements, totaling altogether 760 families.
The ejidos are legal entities which permit rural communities to enjoy the
use of lands while ownership remains with the Federation. The charters also
establish the right of individual members (ejidatarios) to share in the
usufruct land rights of the community.
2.12      Ejidatarios in Ocoroni usually work in groups of 20 to 50 families
except when they seek outside employment. The Ministry of Agrarian Reform has
obtained covenants from the three ejidos of the project area in which they
have agreed to limit the allocation of land held per ejidatario family to 5 ha
in the area once the lands is irrigated. This will allow, in addition to the
existing 760 families already in the project area, the settlement of 1,240
more families, also with an allocation of 5 ha per family. All the new
settlers will be organized in ejidos, as a condition to their having land
allocated to them. It is estimated that out of the eventual 2,000 ejidatarios,
about 200 will be engaged in individual farming and the rest wíll be working
in communal groups of 20 to 40 families each.  For details, see Annex i,
Table 5.
Population and Employment
2.13      The Ocoroni Valley is under the jurisdiction of the Sinaloa de
Leyva municipality in which an estimated 75,000 people are living today.



-8-
Most of those economically active are engaged in rural works, with less than
10% deríving their livelihood from commerce and services. In the Ocoroni
Valley itself, statistics from 1979 indicate that there are about 3,600
inhabitants, with an average family size of five people. There are, however,
additional transient people who are not recorded in the official statistics
but who drifted to Ocoroni because of seasonal works in the adjacent areas.
It is estimated that the area reflects generally the unemployment situation in
Mexico and, therefore, only about 50% of the active labor force can find year
around employment off the farm.
2.14      Presently only about 9% of the available labor force in the three
ejidos in Ocoroni is occupied in the cultivation of land.  As a result, it
is estimated that current annual income per family is about Mex$25,000
(US$1,100) per annum, of which about 60%, about Mex$17,350 (US$770) comes
from off-farm employment. This indicates that, presently, the typical income
of an ejidatario's family falls near the relative poverty level.
Present Production
2.15      At present about 2,400 ha are cultivated under rainfed conditions
(including 400 ha in the dam site of El Sabinal which would be flooded even-
tually) with such crops as sesame (250 ha), groundnuts (400 ha), sorghum
(1,200 ha) and maize (550 ha) (Annex 1, Table 6). Yields are relatively low;
for instance, sorghum yields about 1.5 tons per ha; maize, 1.05; groundnuts,
0.8; and sesame 0.4 (Annex 1, Table 7). Crop husbandry is relatively poor
as well. In addition to crops, the existing ejidos own about 1,000 head
of cattle, mainly zebu. Annual husbandry is rudimentary, with little atten-
tion given to breeding, sanitation and feeding.  The herd is dual-purpose,
though milk yield is relatively low, at about 2 liters per cow.  Fattening
is done outside the valley at higher elevations where precipitation is more
consistent throughout the year, making pastures more nutritious than in
the valley.
Agricultural Support Services
2.16      Extension.  Agricultural extension services are provided under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH). Complementary support
is given by private banks and the National Bank for Rural Credit (BNCR), with
the latter playing more of a credit identification and supervisory role than
supplying actual services.
2.17      Presently very little rainfed technical assistance is provided
in the Ocoroni area, which operates under the Rainfed Districts Department
of SARH (Annex 1, Chart 1). With the project, a new irrigation district
will be created, the Ocoroni Irrigation District, and as a result extension
services will be completely reorganized and modelled upon those already
existing in the nearby Sinaloa and Fuerte irrigation districts. These operate
under the District Integrated Technical Assistance Program (DITA) through
the basic unit of the irrigation district administered by the District chief.
Under the present system in Sinaloa and Fuerte, an extension officer is
an agricultural graduate. He is responsible for an area of about 3,000 ha
comprising 300 to 500 farm families and is assisted by two agricultural
technicians.  Farm visits are closely programmed, weekly meetings are held to



discuss field production problems, training requirements, and research support
requirements. The extension officer is also responsible, in cooperation with
the Center for Agricultural Research of the North (CIAPAN) (para 2.18), for
the layout of field demonstration plots on selected farmer sites in his area.
2.18      Research.  Agricultural research in the State of Sinaloa is the
responsiblity of the CIAPAN station, which is affiliated with the National
Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA). CIAPAN is situated between Los
Mochis and Guasave where soils and climate are similar to the main series of
the Ocoroni project area. The work program for the station is defined by the
Sinaloa permanent commission for agricultural research and is financed from
both the national budget and from a crop tax levied on both private farmers
and ejidatarios.
2.19      The station covers about 150 ha of irrigated land and deals with a
wide variety of crops. The research program's main objectives are to:
(a) breed, introduce, select and field test plant material for yield
improvement and pest and disease resistance. The work being carried
out, particularly on wheat, beans and maize, is of a highly profes-
sional standard and close links are maintained with the International
Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT).
(b) perform research on problems identified by extension workers
and farmers. The program at present concentrates on chemical
control of pests, diseases and weeds and this includes off-
station field testing of fertilizers and water management at the
farm level; and
(c) print and distribute to extension staff information on cultural
practices for crops grown in the state.
2.20      Credit.  Presently only a small amount of credit is being supplied to
or demanded by ejidatarios from Ocoroni and the main source of credit is the
BNCR branch of Sinaloa de Leyva. With the project, credit would be available
also from the two BNCR branches located in Guasave (one of them is a regional
headquarters branch). Altogether, there are more than 40 professionals engaged
in the BNCR branches in processing loans for the entire Sinaloa Fuerte area.
Both short and long-term loans are being processed in all the branches.
Approximately 30% of the loans are for long or medium terms and the rest are
for short terms. At present, there is no shortage of credit and none is
expected. Loan repayments have been generally without significant problem
with loan overdues amounting to only 5% of the balances. Private banks are
also active in rural lending, providing 70% of agricultural loans to the Rio
Fuerte/Sinaloa area.
2.21      Crop Insurance.  Crop insurance, a Government-sponsored program
implemented by the National Crop and Livestock Insurance Agency (ANAGSA),
is operative to a limited extent in the project area. With the project, it
would be more pervasive, as it is already in the Sinaloa Fuerte area, because
crop insurance is a precondition for receiving a loan from the public banking
system. The insurance plan covers a maximum of 70% of the estimated production



- 10 -
cost of irrigated crops and 50% of nonirrigated crops. Premium rates vary
from 1.9% of the production cost for cotton to 9.65% for beans. Cost rates
are estimated and the premium is collected by BNCR. About 20 inspectors check
crops in the Sinaloa/Fuerte area and, generally, the program works well.
2.22      Marketing.  A well established marketíng organization handles
the major commodities produced in Sinaloa de Leyva. The National Marketing
Corporation (CONASUPO), established by the Government to regulate the price
and supplies of basic food items, purchases grain crops from farmers at
the official support prices which are generally in line with the free market.
However, for commodities such as maize and sorghum, which have been in short
supply and with imports increasing, support prices are appreciably higher.
Fruits and vegetables are marketed mainly through the Confederation of
Agricultural Producers of the State of Sinaloa (CAAES). This organization
with its main office in Culiacan consists primarily of private farmers and is
engaged in export marketing to the United States.
2.23      Storage.  Storage is provided mainly by CONASUPO and the National
Storage and Warehouse Agency (ANDSA), which is a private organization.
CONASUPO is also involved in buying and selling farm commodities, providing
even the transportation from the farm to storage facilities as well as to
the major consumption centers.  ANDSA is engaged mainly in storage of crops.
The CAAES has warehouses for vegetables for export, but most of them are
near the border of the United States.
Transportation
2.24      The project area is well served by roads and railways.  The Pan-
American Highway which runs from California to South America is only 30
km from the project area to the south, and a railway connecting Mexico City
with the U.S. border is located less than 1O km from the project area in
the southwest. A railroad that runs from the port city of Topolobampo to
Chihuahua also passes near the project area through San Blas, which is about
40 km to the west of the Ocoroni Valley. The project area itself is served
by networks of roads connecting it with Tompolobampo, Guasave, Los Mochis and
Sinaloa de Leyva.
Social Services and Infrastructure
2.25      Many agencies provide social services in the project area but
most are available only in the town of Sinaloa de Leyva. Communications
are handled by a regional telephone and telegraph center in Gusave. Educa-
tional facilities, potable water, sewage system and road services, postal
services and electricity are all available in Sinaloa de Leyva but only a few
are provided outside the town.

III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01      The Ocoroni Irrigation Project was prepared by the General Direc-
torate (GD) for Large Scale Irrigation of the Sub-Secretariat of Hydraulic
Infrastructure (SIH) of SARH (Annex 1, Chart 1). It was first presented
to a Bank preparation mission in mid-1979. A feasibility study was submitted
in December 1979 and the project was appraised by a Bank mission in April 1980.
Pro-ect Oblective
3.02      The project objective is to increase agricultural production in
the Ocoroni Valley through (a) the development of an irrigation infrastructure
for 10,000 ha of land whích is the maxímum that can be irrigated within
existing water constraints; and (b) provision of technical assistance to the
ejidatarios benefitting from the project.
Project Description
3.03      The project would provide for:
(a) an earth fill dam with impervious core at El Sabinal, which
is a site on the Ocoroni River, 40 km upstream in the Ocoroni
Valley.  The 5eservoír would have a s5orage capacíty of about
300 million m of which 260 million m would be líve storage.
The dam would be about 70 meters high and it would include a
4 m diameter tunnel; a concretS-lined 320 m long spillway with
a maximum discharge of 2,500 m /sec; and a 50 km access road to
connect the 5eservoir to the project area. The dam would yield
about 140 Mm per annum, enough to irrigate about 10,000 ha;
*(b)  a diversion dam at San Miguel, 245 m wide, equipped with tio
controlled outlets with a total discharge capacity of 15 m /sec
flowing into two main canals, one on the right bank (20 km) and one
on the left bank (17 km) of the Ocoroni River;
(c) a distribution and drainage canal network on the right bank (15 km
and 23 km, respectively) and on the left bank (39 km and 19 km,
respectively), including service roads and control structures;
(d) service roads, control and other pertinent structures for the
above canals, and other roads to connect the towns of Nuevo Poblado
(in the Ocoroní Valley) to existing main feeder roads; houses for
ditch riders; communication and power líne system; office buildings
for the operation of the Ocoroni Irrigation Distriet; and work camps;
(e)  indemnification for property and land within the dam site affecting
about 240 families and for rights of way; resettlement of the evacuees
from the El Sabinal reservoir and infrastructure for new settlers;



- 12 -
(f)  clearing of brush on about 6,000 ha of land (about 4,000 ha out of
the 10,000 ha to be irrigated does not need land clearing). Removal
of rocks from about 2,100 ha of land; and leveling of about 3,500 ha
of land in the project area;
(g)  a technical assistance program which would provide for new staff,
equipment and supplies to the project area as no organizational set
up exists presently to assist irrigation agriculture in Ocoroni.
The program would include funds to ímprove the skill, knowledge and
benefits for extensionists, four farm demonstration centers, and
special funds for studies and trainíng in other centers outside of
the project area; and
(h)  studies for further development of irrigation and drainage, in the
Ocoroni, Sinaloa and Fuerte River Basins. These studies would be
conducted during the last three years of the project. Terms of
reference for the study would be reviewed by the Bank prior to its
being carried out.
Design Criteria
3.04      Irrigation works would be designed for water delivery to blocks
of up to 60 ha each. Water control and measuring structures would be part of
the canals and distribution network and would permit monitoring of water up
to 60-ha block turnouts. The conveyance and distribution systems would be
lined. All farm land would be cleared of brush and rocks and leveled where
necessary. High irrigation efficiencies have been assumed, giving an overall
efficiency of 60%. Effíciencies of this level have been reached elsewhere in
this region. Water requirements were determined by the modified Blaney-Criddle
method. The proposed cropping patterns were analyzed, considering constraints
of: (a) available water (Annex 1, Table 4), and (b) water requirements of
each crop (Annex 1, Tables 8 and 9). The water delivery system would supply
about 1.5 lt/sec/ha. The cropping pattern that is compatible with the water
constraints and showing the amount of irrigated land cultivated each month at
full development is presented in Annex 1, Table 10.
3.05      Drainage works would comprise construction of new surface drains.
The drains would vary from 2 to 4 m in depth, permitting water from the
heaviest storms to be drained from the land within 48 hours, i.e., 3.0 lt/sec/ha.
The main feeder roads would be 5.7 m wide and service roads, 3.4 m and both
types would run beside the main drains and canals. Other roads would connect
the two project towns - Ocoroni and Nuevo Poblado - to the main feeder roads.
3.06      For the dam, the criteria used for the different components took into
account necessary safety measures and meet the Bank requirements (OMS 3.80).
Detailed designs for the dam and its components have already been completed.
In accordance with Bank Dam Safety Guidelines, a panel of independent experts,
already in existence in Mexico, would review the final design of El Sabinal
dam prior to tendering. The panel consists of high level experienced person-
nel in dam design and construction. The termis of reference for the panel of
experts would include making recommendations for maintenance, inspection and
safety precautions to be followed during operation of the dam. Assurances on
the above matters were obtained at negotiations.



- 13 -
Implementation Schedule
3.07      Project implementation would commence in 1980 and be completed by
December 1985.  The Government has already started to contract some of the
works (para 3.09). The initial work for the El Sabinal reservoir includes
preparation of detailed designs for the dam (already completed); clearing of
the dam site; and building of an access road and field camp.  Action would
start on most of these items immediately after Board approval.  Final design
of other irrigation infrastructure components is almost completed. The civil
works of the dam and the main irrigation infrastructure such as the main
canals, diversion dam, roads, and drainage systems (para 3.03) are expected to
be completed within a five-year period. The implementation schedule, presented
in Annex 1, Table 11, gives the percentage of each activity expected to be
completed annually for each system.
Cost Estimates
3.08      The proposed project is estimated to cost, based on 1979 prices,
about US$55 million, including price and physical contingencies. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at about US$24 million, or about 44% of
total project cost. The costs of imported equipment and materials reflect
international market prices, while costs of civil works have been estimated
from experience gained with similar projects now being implemented. Physical
contingencies were calculated at 15% of civil works costs of the main irriga-
tion infrastructure, and between 15% and 25% for the dam in view of recent
experience with other dams. Price contingencies for foreign costs are based
on the Bank's revísed guidelines, starting at 10.5% in 1980 and dropping to 9%
for 1981, 8% for 1982, and 7% for 1983 and 1984. Price contingencies for the
local component were estimated at 18% for 1980 but are the same as the rates
applied to the foreign component from 1981 onwards. It has been assumed that
deviations between international and internal inflation would be compensated
for by changes in the exchange rates. Physical and price contingencies
combined make up about 55% of the base cost.  Import duties, taxes and
other levies are not included in project costs because the implementation
agency, SARE, is exempt from import duties.  Project costs are summarized
below and details are presented in Annex 1, Tables 12 and 13.

Financing
3.09     The Bank loan of US$23 million would be made to the National Finance,
Inc. (NAFINSA) for the foreign exchange component less the cost of land
clearing whích is financed through a special Government nationwide program
(altogether the loan would cover about 42% of the project cost, Annex 1, Table
14). The Government would finance the remaining cost, amounting to about
US$32 million equivalent (about 58% of the total), through budgetary allocation.
The Bank loan would be for a period of 15 years, including three years of
grace. The Mexican Government has asked for retroactive financíng of about
US$350,000 to finance the cost of final design work, preparation of bidding
documents and access roads to the damsites and related structures, which have
already started. The Bank has agreed to this, provided it has found the con-
tracts for these works to have been awarded in accordance with Bank procedures
and executed to the Borrower and Bank's satisfaction, and provided contracts
for the retroactive finance works were made after April 1980, the month in
which the Bank appraisal mission visited the project site.

Procurement
3.10      About 85% of the contracts for the principal irrigation and drainage
works, amounting to about US$35.0 million, including contingencies, would be
procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in aceordance with the
Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works would, insofar as possible, be
grouped into contracts having a minimum value of US$2.0 million. Small jobs
(telecommunications, buildings, houses), which, because of the timing or
nature of the work, could be better handled if not included in major con-
tracts, would be contracted following ordinary Government procedures. This
process would also expedite the construction of minor civil works under local
competitive bidding (LCB). The maximum value per contract would be US$0.22
million, with the total of all such contracts not to exceed US$4.5 million.
3.11      Contracts for on-farm development works (including land clearing and
land leveling)»about US$1.5 míllion, would be procured under LCB, or through
negotiations following Government procedures, which are satisfactory to the
Bank (land clearing work, costing about US$2.0 million, contracted already
through BNCR, are not included here as it would not be eligible for Bank
financing). In the project region, farmers frequently organize themselves
into partnerships to contract for land clearing and leveling on small tracts
up to 250 ha using their own machinery. This work provides income to the
farmers, but, more importantly, it trains them in proper leveling procedures
and prepares them to maintain their fields in good condition for irrigation in
the future.  SARH provides engineering services and supervises such contracts.
3.12      The estimated cost of vehicles, farm machinery, and operation
and maintenance equipment is about US$1.5 million, of which about US$1.0
million would be subject to ICB, according to Bank Guidelines for Procurement
(March 1977). For bid evaluation, a 15% margin of preference or the pre-
vailing custom duties, if lower, would be allowed for equipment and vehicles
produced in Mexico. About US$0.5 million worth of minor equipment not
suitable for ICB would be purchased through normal local procurement proce-
dures. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that procurement would
be as outlitned in this and preceding paragraphs.
Disbursement
3.13      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed, with normal documen-
tation, against categories presented below. A summary schedule of expendi-
tures for the entire project is presented in Annex 1, Table 13. A disburse-
ment schedule, based on the project cost, commencing in the latter part of
1980, is presented in Annex 1, Table 15. The table below sets forth the
categories of items to be financed from loan proceeds, the amounts of the loan
allocated to each category, and the percentage of expenditures for items to be
financed in each category:

Accounts and Auditing
3.14       SARH would maintain separate records to reflect the financial
situation of the project. Such accounts are subject to periodical internal
audits conducted by a special audit division of SARH. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that Government would:  (a) maintain or cause to be main-
tained separate project accounts adequate to reflect in accordance with sound
accounting practices, resources and expenditures, in respect of the project,
of the department and agencies of the Government responsible for carrying out
the project or any part thereof; (b) cause such accounts to be verified in
line with the Borrower's internal procedures; (c) annually furnish to the
Bank a summary statement of such accounts; and (d) furnish to the Bank such
other pertinent information concerning such accounts as the Bank shall
reasonably request from time to time.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Institutional Framework and Management
4.01       Two sub-secretariats of SARH would be responsible for the
formulation and implementation of the project. In SIH, the GD for large-
scale irrigation that conducted the feasibility study, would also carry
the design and construction phase of the project. In the Sub-secretariat
of Agriculture and Operations (SAO), the GD for Irrigation Districts would
be responsible for the operational phase of the project.
4.02       SARH maintains offices in each state, administered by a representa-
tive, who is considered the direct representative of the secretary of SARH.
From a functional point of víew, however, state offices are organized fol-
lowing the headquarters pattern. Thus, on the project site, physical works
would be administered by the Resident Engineer (Jefe del Programa Hidraulico)
who reports to the GD of Large-Scale Irrigation and to the SARH state repre-
sentative. Similarly, the newly established Ocoroni Irrigation District which



- 17 -
would be under the direct control of the Guasave Irrigation District's Chief
and would be responsible for administering project operations (such as operation
and maintenance and technical assistance), wou]d report to the GD of Irrigation
Districts and to the SARH state representative.
Project Execution
4.03       The resident engineer for the Sinaloa and Fuerte/Sinaloa projects
would also serve as resident engineer for Ocoroni. He is an experienced and
competent engineer, who would head a team of chief engineers responsible for
design, field planning, specífications, supervision of construction and the
preparation of annual budgets. While annual budgets are to be approved by the
SARH state representative, the approval of the engineering design, planning
and specifications is the responsibility of SIH in Mexico City. These arrange-
ments are already working satisfactorily in the neighboring irrigation districts,
and no difficulties are foreseen for their application in Ocoroni.
Pro_ect Operation
4.04       The Ocoroni Irrigation District organization, which is still to
be set up, would include one independent department, namely, Operations and
Development, and would be dependent on the Guasave Irrigation District for the
services of two other departments, namely, Conservation and Maintenance and
Administration Services (Chart 2 in Annex 1). The district would also have a
Steering Committee, consistíng of representatives of ejidatarios and other
organizations involved in marketing and financing, such as CIAPAN, BNCR, and
CONASUPO. The Steering Committee would advise and assist the Chief of the
Irrigation District in developing the district's annual agricultural program,
which would then be submitted to the GD of Irrigation Districts in Mexico City
for approval. The review at this level is only to assure that the program is
within Government guidelines and policy.
4.05     The Operation and Development Department of the Ocoroni Irrigation
District would be divided into three sections: one for supporting technical
units that include hydrological measurement, users census and statistics;
the second for irrigation and drainage engineering that determines and exe-
cutes irrigation, drainage and leveling works; and the third consisting of
two operational units, one for the distribution and control of water and one
for technical assistance. The two operational units would be organized in two
irrigation units, one for the right and one for the left bank areas dominated
by the irrigation canals. Each unit in turn would consist of two area zones
of responsibility (para 4.09).
4.06       The Conservation and Maintenance Department of the Guasave Irrigation
District would provide to the Ocoroni District services that would include
major repairs and works pertaining to operation and maintenance of the Ocoroni
District infrastructure. Under the project, the annual operation and mainte-
nance costs would be about US$46 per ha. Details are shown in Annex 1, Table 16.
Under the project, maintenance equipment amounting to about US$0.9 million
would be purchased. The equipment list with costs is shown in Annex 1, Table 17.
The Irrigation District would prepare a maintenance program to be updated
annually to ensure that all irrigation, roads and drainage works and facilities
were properly maintained.



- 18 -
4.07       The Administration Services Department of the Guasave Irrigation
Dístrict would be responsible for water charges collection; accounting; and
personnel and other administratíve business of the Ocoroni Irrigation District.
Technical Assistance
4.08       The technical assistance investment program would include the
following: (a) establishment of an agricultural extension program to support
the 2,000 familíes that would practice and administer irrígation agriculture
for the first time in their life (Annex 1, Table 18). After the project
has been executed, technical assistance would continue to operate and would
amount to about US$250,000 per annum and would be financed by the Mexican
Government; (b) financing of staff salaries and their field and office support
requ-rements including a vehicle for each of the agricultural extension officers
and a motorcycle for the intermediate technicians; and (c) studies in the use
of alternative cultivation systems, overhead irrigation trials and farm
demonstrations.
4.09     The organization proposed for the technical assistance component
conforms to that already established in the state irrigation districts.
The extension service activities in the project area would be coordinated
by the Chief, Technical Assistance, working from the office of the Project
Resident Engineer and, after the project is implemented, by the Chief of
the Ocoroni Irrigation District. Each of the two irrigation units in Ocoroni
would have a technical assistance and water distribution office and each
of the unit zones would be served by an Agricultural Extension officer and
two intermediate technicians. Each officer would be responsible for about
1,500 ha, or about 300 farm families. This intensity of coverage is con-
sidered necessary due to the. lack of farmer experience in irrigated agricul-
tural techniques.
4.10       Staff recruitment would commence immediately with the execution
of the project in order to set up the organization, familiarize the staff
with the area and the ejidatarios and to allow the staff proper training
and preparation. Field extension staff would all be certified agronomists
but they would also get three months of training at the CIAPAN Research
Station where they would gain experience in extension operational procedures,
become familiar with the recommended agronomic practices for crops to be
grown, and knowledgeable in the procedures for the laying out of trial and
demonstration plots. Altogether, there would be a need, in addition to a
chief, for six extension officer agronomists, three for each unit, and a staff
of 12 intermediate technicians, two serving under each agronomist. In addition,
there would be a need for one economist, one surveyor and two social workers.
On the basis of the experience gained from the neighboring irrigation district,
recruitment of the staff needed for Ocoroni is not likely to be difficult.
4.11     Technical assistance staff would conduct an investigation of overhead
irrigation, both because water is in relatively short supply and because
considerable interest has been shown by farmers in surrounding irrigation
areas. Such an approach could open the possibility of enlarging the area
cultivated and increase the overall economic benefits of the project. Provi-
sion, therefore, has been made for the purchase and demonstration of suitable
equipment, together with trials on crop/water efficiencies.



- 19 -
4.12       The technical assistance staff would also conduct tríals and
demonstrations to introduce a time operation (scarification) which has been
proved to have agronomic advantages in terms of maintenance of structure and
moisture conservation under similar conditions. Current cultivation operations
of ploughing and two disc harrowings are expensive and probably unnecessary on
the light soil of the Ocoroní Basin.
Credit
4.13       The need for credit would be particularly important because of
the large number of new settlers who lack basic infrastructure. About
US$1.7 million of long- and medium-term credit per annum would be needed for
resettlement and for on-farm development not financed under the project (such
as drainage and irrigation ditches) and about US$7.2 million of working
capital per annum would be needed to buy the essential inputs. It is essen-
tial, therefore, that Government should guarantee the provision of short-,
medium- and long-term credit as and when required to utilize adequately the
facilities included in the project. Assurances to thís effect were obtained
during negotiations.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.14       Monitoring and evaluation of the proposed project would be intro-
duced during and after the development period. During the development period,
monitoring of the construction works, including the resettlement program,
would be done by the Chief Engineer of the project, who would provide written
reports. Progress would be based on percentage of completion reached on each
task or job (Annex 1, Table 11).
4.15       Monitoring and evaluation of operation and management would be
handled by the office of Drainage and Irrigation to be established in the
Irrigation District. This office would have staff at the field level in
each unit, able to prepare suitable reports on its activities.
4.16       The technical assistance program would be monitored and evaluated
primarily through monthly reports prepared by the Extension Service. The
reports would be concerned with the extension agents, the progress of the
farmers, and the effect of the project on the environment. Staffing of
the extension program, training the agents, and receipt of supplies and
equipment would be matters of interest. For the farmers, changes in yield,
cropping intensity, cropping patterns, applications for credit, loan repay-
ments, and the spread and use of improved inputs would also be monítored.
In addition, extension agents would monitor effects of chemicals on the
fauna, flora and water in the project area. Because each unit would have
social workers, sociologists and economists, family budget data would also
be secured. These procedures, already applied in the neighboring districts,
would be extended to the Ocoroni Valley.
4.17       As standard operation procedures at SARH require, semestral reports
would be made on the progress of construction, operation and maintenance,
agricultural development and the technical assistance program. These reports
would be available to the Bank for review and comments. No later than a year



- 20 -
after the final Bank loan disbursement, a project completion report would be
submitted to the Bank of such scope and detaíl as the Bank may reasonably
request. Assurances on the above were obtaíned at negotiatlons.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND FARM INCOME
Cropping Pattern, Yields and Production
5.01      At full development, the cultívated area would increase from
2,400 ha, presently under rainfed cultivation, to 10,000 ha under irriga-
tion (Annex 1, Table 6). In the first fíve years of project implementatíon,
development of the agriculture program would be relatively slow because water
would start to become available for irrígation only in the fourth year, and
the reservoir dam would be completed in the fifth year. The entire project
area would be fully irrigated only from the sixth year. It has been assumed
that farmers would gradually develop their skills to administer irrigated
farms efficiently, and, therefore, full development of the cropped area and
the crop yíelds would reach their potential in the Ilth year. The cropped
area under irrigation would be at full development 14,700 ha, which implies a
cropping intensíty of 147%. As a result of these changes, the net value of
production would increase gradually and would reach about Mex$139 millíon
(about US$6.2 million) per annum from full development onwards (Annex 1,
Tables 19 and 20). The incremental value of production is estimated to reach
about Mex$133 million (about US$5.9 míilion) per annum from full development
onwards (Annex 1, Table 20).
5.02      A wide range of cereals, pulses, vegetables and fruíts can be
grown in the project area. The class I soíls provide no sígnifícant limita-
tíon on cropping alternatives, províded nitrogen and phosphate are applled.
Wíth classes II and III, the lighter soils, cropping alternatives are somewhat
more limited than class I soils, and the most suitable crops would be sorghum,
fruíts, and vegetables.
5.03       The cropping pattern projected for the project area is based
on two important considerations: (a) crops that are typically grown success-
fully in nearby areas; and (b) maximization of farmer's return, subject to
the constraints of water, soil, labor, cost and market opportunities. Typical
crops that are grown successfully in the Sinaloa area and are also expected
to be grown in Ocoroni are: wheat, sorghum, cotton, chick peas, beans and
vegetables. The largest part of the cultivated area in the main season would
be devoted to wheat and beans (Annex 1, Table 6). To a lesser extent, the
main season area would also be cultivated with chick pea, cotton and vege-
tables. During the second season, the area would be utilized mainly for the
cultivation of soya and, to a lesser extent, for sorghum and melons.
5.04      Projected yield increases to full development were deternined on
the basís of observation-and of comparing with records in other areas In
which similar climatic and ecological conditíons exist. In addition, the
yíeld projections reflect two main considerations: (a) that the technical
assístance program would have sígnífícant impact on implementation of an



- 21 -
efficient agricultural program and practices in the Ocoroni Irrigation Dis-
trict; and (b) that project implementation would yield an irrigation water
efficiency of about 60%, which would be achieved through canal lining, land
leveling and an efficient on-farm delivery system. Yield projections in the
irrigated areas are presented in Annex 1, Table 7 and for the main erops are
as follows: cotton, 3 tons per ha; wheat, 4.5 tons/ha; soya, 2.4 tons/ha;
sorghum, 5 tons/ha; and beans, 1.6 tons/ha.
5.05      At full development, annual production in the project area would
be quite substantial. Production of cotton would yield about 3,000 tons;
chick pea, 2,250 tons; wheat, 14,850 tons; beans, 4,800 tons; soya, 10,800
tons; sorghum, 2,350 tons; and fruits and vegetables altogether, about 17,000
tons (Annex 1, Table 21).
5.06      The project would also contribute to the improvement of the dual-
purpose livestock-that the original settlers possessed before the project.
This improvement is expected to be possible mainly because of the following:
(a) the improvement in nutrition as a result of substantial increases in crop
residues from the chick pea, wheat, beans, soya, cotton and sorghum, which
would allow an increase of nutritious grazing of about three months per
animal, compared to present practices; and (b) the network of canals surround-
ing the project area would improve water supply also in the grazing area which
is not cultivated. Proper watering points would be constructed to avoid
damage of canal works. Altogether, the imputed value of the crop residues and
the water points has been considered to be equivalent to 50% of the estimated
net income from the herd before the project.
Farm Models
5.07       Land in the project area would be allocated on the basis of
5 ha per family; however, about 90% of the 2,000 families would likely be
part of communal enterprises of 20 to 40 families in each that will cultivate
the land jointly (each ejido usually comprises several communal enterprises).
About 10% of the families would probably cultivate their land individually,
though they still would be part of ejidos and would benefit from credit and
benefit from credit and other services that the ejido would arrange for them.
With this in mínd, three farm models have been made representing: (a) a
5-ha irrigated individual farm; (b) a 100-ha irrigated farm that includes 20
family members; and (c) a farm with 200-ha of irrigated lands that include 40
famíly members.  The 5- and 100-ha irrigated farms would most likely consist
of new settlers. The 200-ha irrigated farm would consist of existing
ejidatarios that are already organized in communal enterprises.
5.08       A 5-Ha Irrigated Farm.  Among the small farms, production of fruits
(melons) and vegetables would comprise about 9% (0.65 ha) of their cropped
area. Cotton, chick peas, wheat, beans, and soya would be the other important
crops grown (Annex 1, Table 22). Vegetables, however, would contribute
about 26% to their gross income and 38% to their net income (Annex 1, Tables
23 and 24). Cotton would be the next most important crop, contributing about
21% to the gross income and about 20% to the net income.  Family net income
originating from the farm is expected to reach about Mex$78,800 per annum
(about US$3,500) and income from off-farm works could come to about Mex$8,800



- 22 -
(about US$390), compared to an estimated Mex$20,600 without the project
situation (about US$915) per annum (Annex 1, Table 25). With the project,
about 57% of the available family labor would be utílized on the farm, whíle
the rest would have to seek employment elsewhere. This is compared, however,
to no on-farm employment without the project (Annex 1, Table 26).
5.09       A 100-Ha Irrigated Farm.  Unlike the small-type farm, vegetables
would comprise only about 6% of the cropped area in a 100-ha farm (Annex 1,
Table 27). On the other hand, soya would comprise 32% of the cropped area;
wheat about 21%; beans about 21%; and the rest, which includes cotton, chick
pea and sorghum, about 20%. Vegetables, however, would comprise about 21%
of the gross value of production and 31.5% of the net value of production
(Annex 1, Tables 28 and 29); soya, 24% and 18.5%, respectively; beans, 19%
and 17%, respectively; wheat, 16.5% and 16%, respectively; and the rest, 19.5%
and 17%, respectively. Average family income would increase from Mex$20,000
(US$915) without the project (only off-farm income) to about Mex$67,500
(about US$3,000) per annum with the project, with farm income contributing
about 85% of the total (Annex 1, Table 30). On-farm employment would occupy
about 50% of the available labor force (Annex 1, Table 31).
5.10      A 200-Ha Irrigated Farm.  These farms would include slightly
more skilled workers than the other types of farms, because they would
consist mainly of settlers who already lived in the project area and had
some farm management experience, though of raínfed type, whíle other
settlers lack any management experience. In addition to benefits from crops,
the 200-ha farms would yield some benefits from livestock attributed to crop
residues and improvement of water supply to the herd which they owned before
the project (Annex 1, Table 32).
5.11       Among the crops, soya would capture about 30% of the cropped
area; wheat about 25%; beans about 21.5%; vegetables about 6%; and the
rest about 17.5% (Annex 1, Table 32). The share of the crops in the
gross value of production would amount to about 98% and livestock, about
2% (Annex 1, Table 33). The share of the crops in the net value of pro-
duction, however, is only 96%, while livestock would increase its share
to 4% (Annex 1, Table 34). Wheat, beans, soya and cotton are the main
contributors to the net value of production of the crops with 631 of the
total.
5.12      Altogether, family income would increase from Mex$24,800 (US$1,102)
without project to about Mex$70,800 (US$3,147) with the project at full devel-
opment, of which on-farm income would comprise about 47% without project and
about 87% at full development (Annex 1, Table 35). Fmployment on the farm
would increase from about 18% to about 55% of the available labor force and
the rest would have to seek employment elsewhere (Annex 1, Table 36).
5.13      Summary.  The farm models indicate that the project would have a
significant impact on family farm income, particularly in the tenth year when
the farms' full potential would be reached..  At that time, income per family
would be about US$3,900, US$3,000 and US$3,150 for 5-, 100- and 200-ha farms,
respectively. Income per family on a 5-ha farm would be higher than on a
100-ha farm as, based on experience in neighboring districts, the ejidatario



- 23 -
farming his land individually, would grow a higher proportion of high value
crops (vegetables). Income per family on a 200-ha farm would be higher than
on a 100-ha farm, mainly because of the additional benefits from livestock
(see para 5.10). This compares to a GDP per family in Mexico in 1978 of about
US$5,500 and to an income per family ranging between US$915 and about US$1,100
without the project for newly settled famílies and existing ejidatarios,
respectively.
Cost Recovery
5.14      Analysis of the cost recovery index indicates that it would reach
about 22% for the project beneficiaries (Annex 1, Table 37). The analysis is
based on the assumption that beneficiaries would pay the full cost of operation
and maintenance of the irrigation works through irrigation water charges and
that farmers' contribution to investment would amount to 30% over 25 years,
which is the maximum as established by the Mexican law.  The water charges
payable (direct charges) represent about 12% of the small family farm income;
about 15% of the family income in 100-ha farms; and about 14% of the family
income in the largest farms, and are considered acceptable and ín line with
their capacity to pay.
5.15      Prior to the use of project water by beneficiaries, the Government
will put forth its best effort to establish ínterim water charges to be paid
by producers as soon as the water becomes available to them, and at a level
adequate to cover the established prorated operation and maintenance costs and
as much as practicable of the investment cost. Concurrently, the Government
would complete, as soon as possible, but by no later than December 31, 1985, a
socio-economic study in the project area which would be used as a basis for
the establishment of new levels of water charges based on the farmers' ability
to pay. The new levels of water charges would be established promptly after
the completion of the study in accordance with the provisions of Article 71 of
the Mexican Federal Water Law dated January 1972 and other applicable laws and
regulations. It is also expected that the rates would be reviewed periodically
to ensure their continuing applicability as provided under pertinent laws and
regulations. Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations.
Marketing and Storage
5.16        The increase in exportable commodities would include cotton and
possibly a small percentage of melons and cucumbers. The increase in the
exportable production of fiber cotton would amount to less than 1,000 m
tons per annum and would not constitute any significant impact on the world
market supply or even total Mexican exports. In addition, according to
the Commodities Division projections, the long-term outlook for world fiber
demand is quite favorable, with growth expected to be at a rate of more than
2% per annum compared to a 1.6% per annum increase in world cotton production.
Production of melons and cucumbers would likewise have an insignificant
impact on the total Mexican exportable supply and the portion that would be
allocated internally  could easily be absorbed by domestic markets.  Produc-
tion of tomatoes is geared completely to industry because of the varieties
selected, though a small percentage might be sold on domestic markets, while
production of grains, soya, and oilseeds (sesame) counterbalance the growing

imports or shortages of these products. Production of beans and chick peas
would constitute a miniscule percentage of the domestic supply and would be
easily disposed of on the domestic markets. Since transportation from the
project area is excellent, the bulk of production should be marketed easily.
Existing storage facilities in the region and nearby big cities such as
Mazatlan and Guadalajara could handle the anticipated íncrease in production
as a result of the project.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Benefits and Justification
6.01      Direct economic benefits from the project realized by the bene-
ficary farmers would come from: (a) increased production and, as a result,
substantially increased income compared to the without project situation
(para 5.13); (b) increased employment and job security as about 1,000 landless
and drifting families would be settled and works on the farm would absorb
about 423,000 mandays per annum with the project compared to about 32,000
mandays per annum without the project (Annex 1, Tables 38 and 39). The main
indirect benefits would include development of access roads and improvement in
nutrition. The project would also provide an increase in employment opportuni-
ties for auxiliary services, such as technical assistance and activities of
agro-industries such as cotton gins or oilseed processing plants (sesame and
soybeans). The activities of commerce and banking would also be increased as
more produce and crops would be marketed and more financial resources would be
demanded.
6.02      From a national point of view, the project would support the
Government's rural development policies as it would raise the income of
a particularly poor segment of the population; it would also contribute
to increasing self-sufficiency in grains as well as to increase foreign
exchange revenues of about US$2.0 million from exports of cotton and of small
quantities of vegetables. Additionally, it would help decrease income dispari-
ties between rural and urban areas, thereby reducing rural urban migration.
Economic Rate of Return
6.03      The economic rate of return for the whole project has been estimated
at 15.0% (Annex 1, Table 40). The economic rate of return calculations are
based on the following assumptions: (a) agricultural production figures
were derived from development of the irrigated area in five years and deve-
lopment of yield productions for crops that would reach their full potentials
in about 11 years (Annex 1, Table 7); (b) production costs were priced at
local 1979 constant market prices (Annex 1, Tables 41 to 44); (c) economic
prices for groundnuts, cotton, wheat, soybeans, sorghum and meat products were
based on the Bank projections, but adjusted to farm-gate level, while prevail-
ing farm gate prices were used for other products (non-tradables) (Annex 1,
Table 45); (d) all project works, equipment, technical services and physical
contingencies were included in investment costs; (e) shadow wages for unskilled
labor as a percentage of market wages were assumed at 50% in investment and



- 25 -
the cost of production (this was applied to both hired and famíly labor);
(f) capital cost per hectare, including replacement charges and resettlement
costs, was assumed to be Mex$30,000, depreciated over eight years; and (g) the
life of the project was assumed to be 50 years.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.04      The results of a sensitivity analysis to test the effects on the
economic rate of return of cost overruns and delays or shortfall in benefits
are presented in Annex 1, Table 46. In the case in which benefits were down
by 10% and cost up by 10% simultaneously, the economic rate of return is still
about 13%. Likewise, delay in project implementation of two years would
reduce the economic rate of return from 15% to 12.5%. A switching value test
indicates that if total project costs increased by about 32%, the project
economic rate of return would be 12% (the opportunity cost of capital in the
country), or, conversely, the benefíts could decrease by 24% to yield an
economic rate of return equal to 12%. Annex 1, Table 47 also includes informa-
tion on the switching value test of the various project crops.
Environmental Impact
6.05      The project would have no deleterious effect on the environment
but rather would result in improved use of land and water resources. Also,
improved agricultural cultivation practices under rainfed conditions would
prevent the progressive deterioration of soil structures and subsequent
increasing erosion caused by current practices.
6.06      Irrigation would not result in waterlogging, salinity problems,
or water-borne diseases. Chemicals used to control pests and diseases
would be applied following prescribed procedures and application would be
closely monitored by extension agents who will also train farmers in their
safe use (para 4.16). The extension agent would also monitor possible biocycle
resistance problems in crops and possible aquatic weed problems in canals and
reservoirs. Social workers attached to the technical assistance unit would
assist in the improvements of general health and nutritional standards.
Project Risks
6.07      Because of the experience possessed by SARH with irrigation and
dam building, there are no major risks associated with this aspect of project
implementation. On the other hand, existing ejidatarios that are currently
farming about 2,000 ha under rainfed conditions have no experience in opera-
ting irrigation systems, and new settlers in the project area will lack farm
management experience of any kind. However, all beneficiaries under the
project obtain the greater part of their income from off-farm employment in
adjoining irrigation schemes and through it have generated a practical working
knowledge of the cultivation of a wide range of crops. Their basic skills as
well as the support by the proposed technical assistance program have been
taken into account in the project phasing and production projections.

6.08      An analysis of the seasonal and annual variations in the Ocoroni
River runoff indicates that the El Sabinal reservoir capacity, which is about
twice the projected annual demand of water, is sufficient to cover expected
levels of water consumption and that the risk of water shortages is well
within acceptable safety margin standards.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
would:
(a) use its established panel of independent experts to see that
dam design and construction meet Bank Dam Safety Guidelines,
that construction would be periodically inspected, and that the
panel would make recommendations for maintenance, inspection, and
safety precautions to be followed during operation of the dam
(para 3.06);
(b) Comply with the procurement procedures as outlined in paragraphs
3.10 to 3.12;
(c) Maintain separate project accounts through SARH to reflect the
financial situation of the project in accordance with sound accoun-
ting practices; cause such accounts to be verified in line with the
Borrower's internal procedures; and send annually to the Bank a
summary statement of such accounts and other information as
reasonably requested by the Bank from time to time (para 3.14);
(d) Ensure that the beneficiaries of the project would be provided with
such short-, medium- and long-term credit as and when required to
adequately utilize the facilities included in the project (para 4.13);
(e) Ensure that SARH makes available to the Bank for review semestral
reports on the progress of construction, operation and maintenance,
agricultural development and technical assistance. Also, no later
than a year after the final Bank loan disbursement, a project
completion report would be submitted to the Bank of such scope and
detail as the Bank may reasonably request (para 4.17);
(f) Put forth its best effort to ensure that the Irrigation District of
Ocoroni collects from beneficiaries full operation and maintenance
costs of irrigation and drainage works, plus as much as practicable
of investment costs, and carry out by December 31, 1985, at the
latest a socio-economic study to determine the farmers' ability to
pay (para 5.15).
7.02      Wíth agreement on the above assurances, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$23 million on standard terms and
conditions.

1/  Figures in parenthesis indicate land preparation and harvestíng.  It is assumed that both of those activities last about
two weeks, except that in the cases of cotton and vegetables, harvesting may last about one month.
2/  The figures indicate net land uses, such that if a land preparation comes after harvestíng of some crops at the first
half of the month, only the net increase of decrease in area cropped ls calculated.

1/  Assuming a real cost of interest about 5%.  Repayment of capital is calculated as from Mex$30,000 per ha amortized in 8 years
at full development aud a fraction of it corresponding to the percentage of net income in a given year from income at full development.
2/  Since the system will require substantially less maintenance in the firs tew years, therefore in years 5 and 6 it is assumed that the
total cost will be aBout half of an average of a regular year.  Years3 and 4 reflect a proportionate increase in O & M according to the
increase in the irrigated areas.
3/  Assuming a shadow price for labor of 0.5
